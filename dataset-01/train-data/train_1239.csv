5,"AWESOME TOYS, SO MUCH FUN","Bought this for my son when he was 2.5 for xmas, GREAT TOY, very durable, he is 3 now and still loves it. The fish moves just like a real fish"
3,Good Product,"My only concern is the quality for the price paid. It was about 17 bucks. The fish is battery operated and it sounds very loose when it works. Now I no longer let kids use it, and use it for my own little projects with kids."
2,who in the heck left the gate open?,I bought this book based ont the reviews that were given. I regret buying this book. The story line was all over the place. What happened with the characters that did not die?Enquiring minds would like to know.I would have rather spent my money on another book and borrowed this one.
4,Don't Sleep On This!,"Title caught my eye in BookPage Magazine. Story caught my attention and ending caught my lust for more. Great book to snuggle up with on a cozy Fall evening, but make sure your evening is clear cause this one's hard to put down. A talented new author to watch."
5,Let the truth be told,I read this book in one day because I could not put it down. I received it at a booksigning and I liked the cover and thought the title was interesting too. I could relate to what was going on with some of the characters and it was very realistic. I highly recommend to everyone to read this book. It is awesome!
4,Lust of the Flesh,"This book was a page turner...I really enjoyed reading this book, until I was at the end and the story stopped with lingering thoughts...I recommend reading this book, because so many deal with lusting after the flesh."
4,I Could Not Put This Book Down!,"Lust of the Flesh is an intense look into the nature of human beings. This story incorporates violence, incest, molestation, lies, deceit and more. An engaging account of people truly being lead by their lower desires and allowing their madness to sweep others onto the path of complete destruction.Rolyat has shown in Lust the fragility of the human spirit. She has produced a fictious story that allows the reader to really experience incest, murder, corruption and lies. I could not put this book down!Rating: 4 Stars--Reviewed by Tanya Bates for C&B; Books (4/05)www.CBBooksdistribution.com"
1,Totally Disappounted,"After reading the online reviews I was so excited to read this book. I was certain that this was going to be a page turner that I would be sure to recommended to my book club. Boy, was I ever wrong. I hate to be critical of an author's work but this book was just terrible. It was just a horrible story line with totally unbelievable turns and twists. Not to mention, the only interesting twist ""the secret under the bed"" was left unanswered. The only reason I kept reading the book was because I knew it had to get better at some point. Was I ever wrong. One of, if not the worst Christian fiction I have ever read."
5,Once you get started it's hard to stop,"This book and The Connection were referred to me and I bought them based on the good reviews I read. I agree, they both are excellent books. I tried putting this book down so I could get some work done but it was hard. Nick, Elee, Willie-Rev.Braxton and Ben are some scandalous mother*&^%#@s. My only complaint is that the author left loose ends cliffhangers. I wish she would've just told the whole thing all at once instead of making readers wait for book II. I promise this one will entertain you from beginning to end. I read this and The Connection in three days."
1,Turned into POS after first year,"I wrote a review here almost two years ago, stating how I've had this product for almost a year and I haven't had any problems with it.Well, it's year two (Dec 2008) and there is not a single phone out of the 4 I have that hasn't had a problem. Three of them now have an unreadable display and one of them randomly turns off. It's not a battery problem, as I've replaced all of them recently. Also, the quality of the speakerphones have degraded to the point where you can't use them anymore. You can hear the other party fine, but when you talk, they only hear a crackle.To top it off, I got a wireless internet router a couple years ago, and this thing operates on a similar frequency! When I use the phone while I'm downloading, the download slows to less than 1/3 the speed and you hear an annoying crackle on the phone."
2,What's the point?,"If you have ""Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death"" and ""Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables"" you pretty much have everything on here. ""Gaslight"" is okay, but it's not worth buying a CD for. Maybe it'll wind up on a bootleg 45 like ""Cold Fish"" did, but it's not that thrilling anyway. Neither are the covers. It's not really fair how much the remaining DKs have been demonized in the scene, but then again, putting out junk like this and the ""Lost Tapes"" DVD isn't helping their cause any. Hey, how about writing new songs? Maybe they could drop the nostalgia tour, change their name to The Iraqi Scientists or something and try to be interesting or original again. But, this CD is just plain boring."
2,Great Learning Bible,Easy to read and understand. Lots of interesting facts. Great Bible for a new Christian to read and learn by.
2,Horrible & Deceptive Volume,"If they are protecting our child's hearing they should show the volkume in the store as it will be, impossible to hear. It's nice in the store, but w/ the package open, this tab falls out & then you can not hear it. Tell people on the box and let them decide to buy it or not. They know that no one would buy it at that beyond low volume."
3,Don't remove volume adjustment,"I asked for this toy for my child's one year old birthday because of her love of Elmo and the phone. However, as everyone else has stated, if you remove the display volume control your child will not be able to hear the toy unless it is directly at their ear. It is difficult to play with if they try to push the buttons they can not hear what Elmo is saying of see the picture of Elmo. I put tape over a piece of paper in the volume hole and she love it. Just remember to keep the tab and tape it up if you want your child to enjoy this toy. I am not sure about the choking hazard but my daughter does not bother the taped area."
4,CAN'T HEAR A THING!!!!!!!!,This is one of the cutest toys yet with Elmo and I was so excited when my son rec'd it as a birthday gift for his first birthday. He fell in love with and so did I. Until I took it out of the BOX!!!!!!! You can't hear a thing. I agree with the others when they say it is false advertising. They should have the toy so loud in the stores/box if that is not what we are actually buying. How sad.
3,STAY AWAY!!!,"This toy was a BIG disappointment. You cannot hear anything Elmo says because the volume is so, so low. It would otherwise be a great toy, but is a huge letdown (at least for my child)"
2,Volume way too low!!!!,I have to agree with the other people here who've purchased this toy. My daughter was in love with a similar one at the babysitter's house so we decided to get her one. In the box the volume was perfect...but when you remove it it lowers too much. You have to put the phone right up to your ear to hear anything but then they can't learn anything because they can't see the buttons and hear them at the same time. I understand the safety reason behind it but what good is a learning toy if you can't use it properly?
4,"So cute, but volume is a problem","I bought this phone for my 2 year old daughter because she loves Elmo. It's such a cute, well-made toy. I ran into the problem everyone else has talked about: the volume. I fiddled around with taking it apart and couldn't figure out from the directions that others have left how to take apart the pieces that control the volume on the inside(I'm not technical at all, need visuals), so I went with the easy option and jammed the clear plastic piece that is inside the back of the phone on the upper right hand side when purchased. It was still attached to the packaging which was sitting in our recycling bin. I trimmed it and used a set of tweezers to push it in and voila, the volume was fixed! My mind was pretty much set on returning it, however thanks to the other reviewers, we are keeping it! Maybe Mommy likes it better than daughter (wink, wink)"
2,"""Unsafe for Toddlers""","Cute toy. Unfortunately, the eyes get stuck opening and closing and the paint chips off. Not a good toy for toddlers who put everything in their mouth!"
3,What Happened To The Volume?,"What happens to the volume after you buy the phone? We have purchased three of these so far, and all three of them have malfunctioned when I got them home. The volume works perfectly in the store, but once you bring it home, you can barely hear it."
3,Not very good,"This is the worst phone toy I have gotten for my daughter. I only purchased it because it had Elmo on it and she wanted it. Compared to other cell phones toys my daughter has, this one is one of the worst. She never uses it now, her interest in it lasted less then a week."
3,Took it back 2 times . . . . Now I know why!,I guess I am a dork b/c I never read the directions all the way through. I couldn't understand why every time I got this toy out of the box the sound would get extremely low!!! I understand why it gets low (now after reading everyone's post) but my son (11mos) never really put the phone to his ear so it wasn't as fun as it was for him in the box. Too much of a hassle for me so I opted not to get another one.
2,Okay until you get it out of box!,"The phone seemed to work fine until I took it out of the box. It was difficult to remove from the wrapping then, mysteriously, the sound became extremely low. I thought changing the batteries would help it didn't. So, in less than a day this toy stopped working."
1,returned before I even left the store,my son LOVES LOVES LOVES Elmo almost as much as he loves playing with our phone so I thought this would be the best toy ever. He wanted to play with it so badly that I borrowed scissors from the checkout to open immediately. Once it was opened just like everyone else reported the volume is ridiculous. you can't hear it at all. One of the reasons we bought it was so he could hear the elmo's world song and you couldn't even hear it. I was highly dissappointed and asked for an immediate refund. I however was not as dissappointed as my crying toddler......it seems like with all of this negative feedback the toy could be changed.......
3,Was very disappointed,My sons grandfather bought this phone for his birthday. My son loves Elmos and can't get enough of him. He loved the phone until I took it out of the box and the sound pretty much went away. He doesn't ever play with it unless he is throwing it to the other side of the room. I was very disappointed when I took the toy out of the box and the volume all but went away. I wouldn't recommend anybody buy this phone for their child unless they fix the volume!
1,Elmos talking cell phone,Not a good toy because you cannot hear it. Grandbaby did not like it cause you cannot hear it and it does nothing but talk very quitely and no bells and whistles for her to be interested in it...it does not even have flasing lites etc...BORING
4,We love Elmo,"Elmo's cell phone is perfect for the 3 to 4 age group. I was surprised the clarity was as good as it is, most eletronic toys do not have greataudio. It's fun as well as educational and it's a kick watching my granddaughter talk on the phone like a grownup. John Camilleri"
2,Not sturdy,"My 18 month old daughter loved this phone at first, even with the low volume. But, within the first 24 hours, it got either knocked or flung from the highchair (not an odd occurrence for a baby toy) and immediately broke. The flip part no longer closes completely, and no longer stays open completely. The result is she now finds it frustrating and annoying, and so do I. I'm going to try to take it apart and see what I can do, but for a 24 hour old toy, it's quite a disappointment."
1,Volume too low and durability questionable,We chose this phone over all the other ones in the store because the volume was great. Little did we know that the volume is high only for the display demo. Once you take it out of the package the volume lowers tremendously.Then the flip part of the phone didn't close shut all the way and kept popping up.We returned it the next day. Our baby didn't even have 1 whole day to enjoy it.
2,how to fix the elmo phones volume,"Hey everyone, I have read all the reviews on how to fix the volume for elmo's phone and I found the best way was to take off the 4 screws and open it up, cut one of the white wires leading to that slit in the back (upper right corner or upper left when looking at it from the inside) I removed the metal piece and cut the white wire, but all you have to do is cut the white wire for sure. now she loves the toy. hope this helps...thxRalphToronto"
2,Can you hear me now?!?,"I bought this for my 18mo. old because she loves to play with my phones. She loved this Elmo phone too, until we took it out of the package. When this product is removed from the box the volume automatically decreases ALOT. (the enclosed pamphlet said this was a FEATURE! so as not to hurt my little ones ears) The problem is the volume is so low(and not adjustable)that it is useless as a learning toy. It is supposed to teach numbers and objects as you push the buttons. But if you are looking at it to push the buttons you can't have the phone up to your ear which is the only way it can be heard. We returned it for another to try to bypass this volume lowering FEATURE to no avail. I'm just going to return it for a refund. Very disappointing, my daughter really liked it when she could hear it."
1,Volume hardly exists!,This toy is an utter disappointment.Changed to new batteries but volume was still barely audible. A definite return to the store!
3,"not bad, except for the volume issue","Looks like it is a common problem with this phone...as soon as the plastic strip is removed, the volume function goes downhill drastically.Ordinarily, I wouldn't mind, as most kids toys are too loud to begin with...but in this case, you can barely hear it once it is freed from the confines of the packaging. Very much a disappointment.Other than that, it is a cute phone...just the right size for little hands and the addition of Elmo is a plus for any Sesame Street fan!"
1,What does it say???,"I have a ten month old who adores Elmo and my own cell phone, so I thought this would be the perfect gift...boy was I wrong! All throughout the store he played with it and loved it. When we got home it was the one toy he was the least interested in. We both were so dissapointed with the volume level. I understand that it is supposed to be lowered for saftey reasons, but the only time he can hear it is if he is in a quiet room. Let us as the parent decide whether or not the volume should be louder. Also, I have found that this phone is very heavy!It's bad enough the volume is so low, but when it's so heavy that my son can barely pick it up to put by his ear, makes it ridiculous!"
3,Stick to the age recommendations,"We got this as a gift for our little girl, who loves cell phones. She likes this toy, but she was too young when she got it. She was in a teething phase and has eaten the Elmo sticker off the front and made teeth marks in the antenna. She still likes it. I did not experience any of the volume problems described in the other reviews, but was glad to see there's an ""off"" switch, which my 8 month old has not yet discovered."
2,Why did they make the volume so LOW?,"My daughter loved this phone in the store. She loves Elmo and she loves to talk on the phone. The phone has two modes, so each button does two different things. Elmo sings part of his ""Elmo's World"" song. We thought, ""What a great phone!""We get it home, take the volume control tab out (like it said to), and we could hardly hear it. We were so dissapointed. Our daughter was, too. She has never really EVER played with it. She can't hear it!!They ruined a great toy!"
3,Not amazing but Elmo fans will like,"Phone is a little too chunky for my daughter to hold comfortably. The Elmo song when she opens it makes her smile, though. She also likes the eyes that open and shut. The image of Elmo on the phone does not hold her attention."
4,Love This Phone!,"Hi, Im a mommy of a new daughter whos now 8 months.I just bought this phone and was shopping for more toys when I come across the reviews and got curious- I agree with the other people about this phone, this is great but the volume does go low and I thought that this was because the batteries were running low but its true the volume does lower itself alot. If I didn't stop to read the other reviews then I was going to go out and buy new batteries. I tried what the other reviewer suggested and put a piece of paper in the slot where you removed the tag then the elmo phone volume can remain high. bye now"
2,"WHAT, WHAT?","I'm glad to see that toy makers are taking into consideration how loud toys can be, but come on! Once we opened the package, the volume dropped dramtically. We can barely here what Elmo is saying now. My baby presses the buttons and opens the flap a few times and then grows bored with this phone because she can't really hear it. The most interesting part to her is the eyes that open/close. There are much better play phones out there."
4,Misrepresented!,"I bought this phone after trying it out in the store. It seemed pretty good and I chose this one from a selection of other cell phones. However, after I took it out of the box and gave it to my son to play with, I noticed that the volume was much lower than I remembered in the store. So I changed the batteries and it didn't get louder. You can barely hear it in a quiet room unless you put it right up to your ear. Then I looked at the packaging and tucked away behind the phone and under a plastic cover, there is a notice saying that once you take it out of the packaging, the volume is set to go down to protect little ears. I understand the safety issue, but the volume is too low in my opinion. There ought to be a volume control somewhere -- even in the battery section so that parents can set the volume themselves."
4,The volume problem is a problem,"I agree with all of the other reviewers, that the volume is way too low once you remove it from the box. I want to thank all of the people who mentioned to stick something back into the little slot to increase the volume. I just did that and it is better. Still a little low, but an improvement. My daughter is such an Elmo fan, that we had to get this for her first phone. But with the volume being so low, I didn't think she would get anything out of it other than the fact that Elmo is on it. So glad I read the other reviews. Great tip! Thanks!"
2,cute phone but volume too low!,"My daughter loved playing with this phone in the store. So I bought it for her 1st birthday. When you take the phone out the volume decreases drastically! You can barely hear it at all. It is very cute and durable, but what fun is it if you cannot hear it?! The phone went back to the store the next day. I was very disappointed!"
2,Couldn't hear it,The volume on this phone was so low you can't hear what Elmo is saying which doesn't provide much fun or learning. This was the same even after trying new batteries.
2,Too Low!,"I got this toy for my daughter last Christmas. She just loved it. When we took it out of the box, the volume went way down. She kept telling me that it was broken. She was very upset. I wish that I could have taken it back, but the volume does not go down until after you open it."
1,"Thanks to J. Fulwood ""new mom""","Thanks to you who have reviewed this phone, especially J. Fulwood ""new mom"". You described how you rigged the phone to be louder. Thanks to you, I just rigged my 3 year old daughter's phone and now we can hear it just like it was when it was in the store!!! Thank you very much for the info. We were really mad when we got the phone home and took out the tag and could barely hear it. Now, we have a ""new"" toy again and my 8 month old will be able to hear it too. Thanks for the great reviews!!!"
1,This toy was a waste of money,"After getting the toy out of the package and pulling the demo tag out, you could no longer hear the sound. What fun is a toy that you cannot hear? My friend had bought this toy and has the same complaint.DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!!"
5,Elmo Phone,this is a great addition to any child that loves Elmo. My 2 Y old loves this Cell Phone and she takes it with her anywhere she goes
3,"My daughter liked it, but not loud and broke too soon","The Elmo's World phone is cute and generally seems well made. But the volume was very low, even with a fresh set of batteries. Also, after only a few months, the terminals corroded and even after cleaned, no longer worked correctly. Overall, I was a bit disappointed."
3,Good when volume is fixed.,"If you don't fix the volume problem then a two star product, if you didn't have to fix it then four star. Poked a bit of plastic in the back - super."
2,Could have used my money elsewhere,"We bought this phone for our 14-month old son hoping that it would divert his attention away from our cell phones. After playing with the toy for a few days our son has completely lost interest in it. As for the quality, the eyes tend to get stuck while opening so the music does not go on until the they are dislodged manually. The volume is not an issue for me though, I like that it is low."
1,breaks quickly,"I purchased this toy after reading 177 reviews which gave the toy an average of 3.5 stars. My kid played with the toy off and on for 3 months. the phone didn't seem special to him, he would bring it to me to press the buttons and then afterward he would grab another toy. After noticing the phone didn't work any longer I replaced the batteries. At this point the phone doesn't make any sound. I have replaced 2 sets of batteries and still the toy doesn't work. I would rate this as junk to any prospective buyer to beware of it."
3,Elmo's not-so-great Cell,"My 7 month old LOVES Elmo and I was so excited to get her her ""own phone"" since she ALWAYS reaches for mine. Although the ""La la la la, la la la la"" when she flips open the cover gets her all excited, there isn't much more that keeps her interest. She bites on the phone, sure, but she does that with anything she can get her hands on. It is cute how she can press and hear the numbers, but the volume is so low (as I've read from reviews before and was under the impression that there was a tab I could leave in to keep the volume high, but did not see this tab and once the phone was removed from the box the volume did decrease substatially)that I can barely hear it. I think that the creator of this toy couldv'e been much more creative when designing this toy. I have the Sesame Street TV remote and it is MUCH better and actually has a volume control and MANY more educational aspects to it. Save your money and buy the remote if you do not already have it!!!"
5,Great toy!,"My son received this phone as a gift for his 1st birthday. He absolutely loves it. For safety reasons (as claimed on the package), the volume is louder while the phone is in the box; however, my son is able to hear the sound while playing with it. I give it to him to play with in the car and it is loud enough for me to hear it from the front seat with radio on. (I drive a Honda Accord.) I would highly recommend this toy as is."
1,Do not bother...,"You can hear it in the store but as soon as you take it home and pull the piece out you can't hear it unless you put it to your ear. Trying to ""fix it"" is just not worth your time, find something else, and continue to read reviews FIRST!"
4,Talking cell phone for kids,"We bought this for our 1 year old who loves to play with remote controls and cell phones, hoping it would distract her from the real ones. She loves to press the buttons and pretend she's talking when Elmo speaks. Each button makes 3 or 4 different sounds, depending on how many times you press it. Opening the mouth piece causes the eyes at the top of the phone to open, while I thought this might be an area that breaks, it seems to be quite durable. Our child also likes to open the eyes with her fingers, and this does not seem to have damaged the toy in any way. Like most toys for our baby, it has had several drops from the high chair onto the hard floor, and continues to work just fine. Overall, we are pleased with this purchase, and this along with the Elmo remote control we purchased seem to have worked in distracting our baby from the real remote and cell phone. We would definitely purchase this again."
4,Here's a fix for the volume,"My wife picked this toy up a few months ago for our twins to use. When we took it out of the box and removed the Volume Tag, the volume decreased to an almost ""too faint to hear"" level. So the kids basically ignored it. Today I decided to ""fix"" the thing. I removed the four screws holding it together, separated the top and bottom halves, then placed a tiny folded-up piece of cardboard (paper will do) into the little square ""volume control"" inside the device. Once you separate the metal contacts, the volume goes back to the level it was when it was in the box! It was very easy to do and only took me about 15 minutes. All you need is a Philips screwdriver and a tiny piece of cardboard, plastic or paper.Now the kids LOVE it!I hope this helps someone out there..."
4,I agree with other reviewers about the volume but still love this phone!,"This is a fantastic baby toy. I keep it in my purse for my little guy. Because of the low volume, I can take it out during church and other places where a louder toy is not appropriate. The design is baby hand friendly. There are enough features on this to keep it interesting but not overwhelming. It's size makes it purse friendly too.For the money, I feel it is great. We have gotten much enjoyment from it and it has also been useful on many occasions to calm a bored or fussy baby while on outings or in the car.I would recommend it even with the low volume."
4,"Volume is too low, but there's a workaround.","When you get this toy, instead of taking out the plastic tab from the back, just cut it off so it doesn't stick out. That way you leave part of it in the toy so the volume doesn't get reduced. That's what I did and my son really likes the phone."
4,"Great toy phone, volume fine for my twins!","I almost did not get this phone because the other reviews said the volume was too low. I decided to get it anyway because my 18-month-old twins really like toy phones. Well, they LOVE it! The volume is fine to them, and to me too. We can all hear it fine, even in the car. I actually think the volume is just right. This is definitely one of the highly desired toys in our household."
1,thought people on here were crazy BUT... THEY ARENT,I bought this toy because I have heard parents complain that volume is too low on an item and it plain wasn't. If you have a child holding a toy to it's ear then it needs to be low but my baby just get frustrated as does my 31 yr old baby (hubby). You can't hear anything..the worst part is when we bought it it was fine. Once you take that tag out of the back forget it.
1,Call the company--get $ back!,"What a disappointment--volume is way too low! My 2-year-old daughter was so disappointed when we took the phone out of the box, she now keeps the phone in closed position (which also closes the eyes) and says it's sleeping.I called the company and they sent me a voucher for $8. Maybe if everyone complains, they'll design something better for our Elmo lovers."
4,thanks for the fix,"My 12 month old son got this toy for Easter on Sunday. Like everyone else here I was sorely disappointed when the volume dropped to an almost non-existent level when it was removed from the package. I thought it was the batteries (even after reading the note enclosed- I thought surely it wasn't supposed to be THAT low!), but nothing helped. Thankfully I read Michelle's volume fix and had saved the box with the plastic tab. I reinserted the tab and cut it off - VOILA, volume restored. I can't wait for my baby boy to wake up in the morning and discover his wonderful new toy! He liked it before but I'm sure now he will love it!"
2,Volume,I agree with everyone else!!!! The toy is wonderful in the box and in the store. I wish I would have read these reviews first but it was an impulse buy in the store. Do not waste money on it....just let them play with it in the store and then put it back on the shelf.
2,This toy was very fun in the box..,"My son is a big Elmo fan and he loved this toy in the store, but when we took the phone out of the box the volume on the phone became so low you can hardly hear it! This was very disappointing! I would not purchase this toy for anyone in the future!"
1,Volume is terrible!!!!,"We picked this toy up at the store as an unplanned purchase because my son seemed to like it so much. the volume was appropriate then. However, once the phone is out of the package the volume decreases dramitically. The only way we can hear it at all now is in a quiet room with the phone held to our ears. A note included with the instructions state that this is normal. What it ought to state is that this is a complete waste of money. Although fun at the store (before volume tab is removed and you can actually hear it), it's useless once opened. Talk about bait and switch!! I am very disappointed with this toy."
3,Good play phone but hard to hear,"When I purchased this ""cell phone"" for my daughter I tested it out in the store. When I got it home and out of the box it got really quiet. Now I understand being too loud could damage a child's ear but my daughter has to have it next to her ear to hear it. This makes it hard to see what buttons are pushed if it is next to your head. If this had a volume control to make it slightly louder I really would love it."
1,Disappointing,I have the same complaint as many others with this particular toy. When I was at the store with my son I let him play with the phone and he absolutely loved it. I knew I had to buy it for him. As soon as I took it out of the box the volume went WAY down. It is almost a whisper. You are barely able to hear the volume unless it is extremely quiet. I thought the toy was defective until I noticed the Note To Consumer explaining that the volume will go down. I think that is terrible that Fisher Price put the notice inside the box. They should have it on the outside of the box where potential consumers can read it and then decide if they want to buy it knowing that information. I would certainly not have purchased it had I known. Now my son has no interest in the phone because he can barely hear it. I cant even bring it back because the package is torn apart. It is truly a disappointment and a big waste of money!!!
4,Agree the volume is too low,"We stuck the tab back in and taped it in place so our daughter could hear it. Otherwise, it's a great toy."
4,My Kid Loves It,"I have a 13 month old son who absolutely loves this phone. I agree with many other reviewers about the lack of volume once you take out the tab. But it's my understanding that they did that because kids will put it to their ears while the phone is talking or playing music, hence afraid of damaging their ear drums. So, for now I haven't tried to rig it so it's louder. He seems to enjoy it fine the way it is. He plays with it all the time and dances around with it."
3,Great toy----if you could hear it :(,"My son-22 months had a blast playing with this in the shopping cart at... When we took it out of the box and pulled out the plastic tab in the back-the volume was SO low-you could barely hear it. I tried to reinsert the plastic tab with no luck. If this was fixed, it would be a great toy! My baby still plays with it, but not nearly as much as he does with his more noisy toys."
1,dont buy it !!! volume too low,i should give it zero star actually....waste of money ..even thou i got it for $10....the volume of toy is tooooo low to enjoy..my 1 yr old didnt even bother to hold it after few minutes and my 3 yr old played with it only for a day....i bought this because my 1 yr old kid loves our home phone and loves to hear the tone and light on the phone....when i bought this toy i knew it has no lights on it... but the voliume is too low that you can only hear elmo when you put it on you ear...the volume is even lower than normal home phones...
2,Can You hear me NOW,"My daughter loved this phone until I removed the saftey tab, now you can barley hear it. This went from very cute to a piece of junk it matter of minutes. I guess it's like mommys cell phone most common phrase is ""CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW""!!!!!"
1,Terrible phone,"This phone was so great IN THE PACKAGE. We bought it, took it home, and opened it for our little girl. Much to our disliking, it was TOO quiet. Our daughter couldn't even hear it, let alone us. It was a complete waste of money. If it was just louder, it would have been a great phone. Save your money, I recommend Fisher Price's Laugh and Learn Home Phone, so much more worth the money."
5,Where Amazon's Reviews come in VERY handy!,"We bought this toy at the store and, as others, were totally in love with it. We brought it home and, oops, there goes the volume! We've been depressed about it for a month until today! I read the reviews and saw the solution! I took a calling card, cut a thin, long piece out, shoved it back into the hole and, VOILA! WE HAVE VOLUME! I didn't even have to cut it flush, I just shoved it in until it was even! I'm SO happy now, and can't wait to show hubby that I fixed the Elmo toy! See, your Amazon reviews DO come in handy!"
2,review for elmo's talking cell phone,"the phones volume level makes this toy a rip off. its nice and loud when you try it in the packaging...but after you remove it...the volume level goes to barely audible ""to protect your childs hearing"". my daughter got mad and threw it because she had to hold it up to her ear to hear it! theres a tab in the back..in a slot..stick a piece of wide tape over it...dont pull it out and throw it away as instructed. if you already did..cut a piece from a plastic strw the size of the slot...fold it over..stick it in there. it works. put a piece of tape of it and youre in business! shame on fisher price for tricking consumers like this!"
3,Expensive for What You Get,"I was looking for a fun phone for my daughter (11 months old at the time). Unfortuantely for us, this was the only phone I could find at all the local retailers. Although, because it had Elmo on it, I was willing to give it a shot.The extremely low volume is both good and bad - it's great for using in church and other places you don't want ""another loud toy"". However it's very poor when trying to listen for the numbers and/ or pictures displayed on each button.In addition, the size of the phone is a bit big for tiny hands. My daughter is on the small side, therefore until just recently, she needed 2 hands to hold onto the phone.I would save your cash and find a different phone that offers more educational values and skip the fact that this one has Elmo on it !"
2,"please, a volume control!","Like most other reviewers, I agree that the volume is way too low - Elmo is practically inaudible. On most of my daughter's other toys I have the opposite problem. I think perhaps they were thinking the child would hold the phone to his/her ear - since it's a phone... but if you do that you can't see any of the cool stuff on the front! I'll have to try a make-shift plastic ""volume increaser"" like a couple of other reviewers have tried. And I hope that works because as cute as this toy is, my little Elmo fan completely lost interest when the sound went away."
2,Fasle Advertising,There is no indication prior to buying this toy that the volume will be turned down to nothing when it is taken out of the box. I can understand the Fisher Price people's concern for children's hearing but the volume doesn't need to be so low. We were very excited about getting the phone and looked forward to playing with it when we were still able to hear it!
2,Was cute at the store,I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 18 months old and loving Elmo. At the store the phone sounded loud and clear but for reasons unknown when I got home the volume was very low. I tried replaceing the batteries but nothing helped. I spoke to a friend who had the same problem with the phone...
1,Deceptive Marketing,I have the same complaint most other reviewers have - once the phone is removed from the packaging the phone is nearly inaudible. There was no mention of this detail on the box/packaging which I think is totally DECEPTIVE. I would not have bought the phone if I would have known the volume would be significantly reduced once it was removed from the box. I called FP and complained. They wouldn't give me my money back - said I'd have to return it to the store where I purchased it. The store won't take it back because it's been removed from its packaging. I am very angry that FP deceived me and now won't give me my money back. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else!!!
1,No good.,"I got this phone for my son but you can barely hear it. I was at Walmart trying it out at lunchtime and it sounded clear and loud and great. Then I brought it back to my office after lunch and was going to call some of the guys and joke around it but you could barely hear the phone. I figured it was broken. Then I saw on the printed instructions that it says the volume is lower when its taken out of the package. I cant believe Fischer Price couldnt take the time to write that on the OUTSIDE OF THE package. My son can barely hear it and its really not worth the money.One good thing did come out of this, I wrote a complaint letter to Fischer Price and they sent me a check to use towards another toy in the amount I paid for the elmo phone."
1,Disappointed with volume,"I loved this toy until I pulled the clear tab out. Once you pull the tab out, you can not hear the toy at all. A waste of money."
4,Elmos world talking cell phone. You can raise the volume..,I bought this phone for my daughter and she loved it before I pulled out the tab for the volume. At first I thought it was broken until I read the directions. But there is a solution if you want to turn the volume back up. Just put a small piece of cardboard into the slot (make sure to cut it off at the end so it doesnt stick out) and it works! Just thought I would share it other moms who were also disapointed with the volume issue.
4,Be prepared to fix the volume problem!,"My 14-month old loved this toy in the store where he played with it still in the box. I, like many other reviewers, was disappointed to see the volume drastically reduces once you take it out of the box. Just as I was about to chalk it up to another waste of money, I read the reviewer who used the bread tie to slip back in the slot to increase the volume. Now, it sounds like it did in the store. If you leave the plastic tab in or use a bread tie, you can cut it flush with the back and cover with tape. Because of the potential choking hazard this may cause, my child only plays with the phone under my watchful eye...never alone. That way if the tape were to start coming off for some reason (drool) I could catch it right away. So far that has not been an issue at all. However, but I feel it important to mention that if you do rig the phone, PLEASE BE CAREFUL as this could possibly pose a choking hazard for your child!"
1,NO SOUND!! Gimme a break,"This toy looks absolutely awesome and was so cute when my son received it. We wanted to surprise him with it so we took it out of the box and we never got the response we wanted. HE COULDN'T HEAR IT!! Neither could we. All of a sudden the volume was almost completely shut off. Rediculous. There should be a volume control on this thing. I'll pay the extra five bucks. I hope the maker of this toy is reading the reviews. Fix the volume!!! Waste of money now because now my son isn't even interested in it. Which seems to be the case with most of you who have also had this same problem. The toy should be recalled for those who own it. I encourage all of you who have had this problem to call the company. If enough complaints come in, hopefully someone will do something."
3,Not his favorite but not bad,My mom bought this toy for my one year old son and we leave it at her house for when we visit (about once a week).I like that the volume is low. When you put the toy up to your ear it is louder-like a real phone. From my understanding that was how it is supposed to be.I think it is a cute toy and my mom and I thought my son would really like it but he hasn't been too impressed. He does play with it but prefers some of his other toys better. We have a cell phone made by Parent and he likes it much better-it actually looks like a real cell phone (or close enough) so he thinks he has the real thing.
3,It's alright,"Volume is barely audible- my son gets his fingers stuck in the mouthpiece all the time.It's okay, but I like the one made by PARENTS better!"
1,Ladonna from Texas,"This is the worst toy phone that I have ever seen! I bought it for my sons 1st birthday and he loved it until we unrapped it and took the tag out of the back, then it was so quiet that he couldnt hear it and wouldnt play with it anymore! So I returned it. They shouldnt make it seem like it is going to be so loud, they should let people hear how loud it really is before they purchase it."
1,This toy would be o.k. if you could hear it!,"This toy seemed great in the store but when we got it home and removed the plastic strip, as many reviewers before me have written, you can barely hear it. My husband stuck a small piece of the plastic back into the phone to return it to the original volume but this is not something you should have to do. I can't imagine why fisher price would make a toy with a volume so low. I have been unhappy with many fisher price products before so I will just add this to the list."
2,Fun for a while,"My one year son recieved this phone as a gift. It was for about the first week. Good sound, and colors. But it stopped working after he dropped it on the kitchen floor."
1,Buyer Beware- Change in volume!,"I saw this toy and my 12 month old loved it in the store, one of his favorite past times is trying to play with the Cordless at home. However, once removed from the box, the volume was so low he lost interest within minutes. There should be a warning on the box. For those babies who just enjoy pressing the buttons, instead of talking into the phone, the decreased volume makes the toy worthless. I did as in other reviews and rigged it."
2,Total false advertising!,"I too bought this phone, and when I took the packaging off, the volume was barely audible! the instructions inside said that was not an error, that is how it is supposed to be. Well then maybe they shouldn't have it so the volume is so loud when it is in the packaging! Obviously, you need the volume up to sell the damn toy, why turn it down? My daughter rarely plays with this phone. I wouldn't recommend it, if not solely for the false advertising!"
2,Jamaican Song and Story,This book is difficult to read and keep me interested. I do not have the music to follow through. I would prefer for these songs to be in music form
2,stones are smaller than i imagined,when i viewed these earrings online the presentation looked fine. when i received the actual product it was disappointing. i would have preferred a slightly larger stone. really sad about that. i don't think i'll trust buying similar products online. not happy.
3,nice earings,"They are very nice earings. The shippment is fast. For the price, it is a good deal. I only feel the color is kind of light, not dark enough."
4,Gorgeous Green Peridots,"I must admit I was somewhat leery about purchasing these earrings, sight unseen. However, I was very pleased when the package arrived & I opened the box. The shade of green was exactly what I was hoping it would be; a nice medium shade with no inclusions.The earrings are bright, clear & perfectly matched. I would have rated the earrings 5 Stars if the gold through the ear had been a little more substantial."
5,Worth the money!,"These are perhaps the nicest garnet earring I have ever seen in this price range. They are worth the money, you won't be disappointed."
5,incredible,"OMG, much more than i expected, so happy i took the word of the positive reviewers...had reservations about buying a second pair online, the previous pair, not from the amazon collection, stones were way smaller than i expected, backs were so small that once you dropped one it was gone, just too small to find, thats how i wound up buying this pair...what an absolute bargin these were, thank you amazon, first yes, the stones are lighter than the photo, for me i like the colored ice look they give, stones to me look 1/2 carat,reasonable amount of gold and the backs, though not as big as they were made many years ago, still they are adequate and bigger than the one i just lost.if you are on the fence about this one, i do not believe you will have any regrets if you do purchase them..."
4,Garnet Earring Studs,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these 14k Yellow Gold Four Prong 7x5mm Oval Garnet Stud Earrings. The color of the stone is a true Garnet color (reddish-brown). I was, however, a little disappointed that the gold post was not centered and the backs were quite small. The price was reasonable and the size of the stone was perfect. I am glad I made this purchase."
5,Quality Workmanship,"I was very happy with the earrings. Actually I was surprised at the quality. They're not AAA grade peridot, but they still have good color and no defects. Additionally, the stones were solidly set with no jiggle. For the price and buying them sight unseen, I was extremely happy with the product."
5,"""Lady in red""","These are much smaller than I thought they would be, however I like the shape and the quality seems good."
3,Pleased,Earrings were sent to my daughter in FL as a small gift. My daughter was very pleased with color and size. Says she wears them often.
4,Nice item,"Size looks little small But the stone quality is good.Mounting is good.I lost one back when I was brushing my hair, But was able to find it after 6 hours. I wish the backs are made some what more sturdy."
3,"beauty, but too big","It's a good earring, but when my mom wears it, the topaz is too big for her. I think it can look better if the topaz was smaller. The color is pretty good, but I prefer dark blue. The price is good too."
2,Not worth the money,"The cover sure makes it look like this is a serious book with a lot of information. Too bad that notion disappears once you open it up. If you're looking to build a smart home and plan on doing some of the work yourself, this book won't help very much. You'll get a little information, but not enough to actually do the job on your own. If you want a smart home and are willing to hire someone to do it for you, then this book will at least tell you what words to use.The best book I've read I've read so far is ""Smart Homes for Dummies."" It has significantly more detail and is useful for someone who wants to try to do this on their own."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on,"If there ever was a case for false advertising, this book takes it all the way. The back cover claims that after reading you will be able to install some of the most modern systems. This book is nothing more than a brief discussion about some of the things that can be automated in the home. The wiring that is covered in the book is juvenile at best. If I had previewed the book at a book store I most definitely would not have purchased book. Pass on this one."
2,Out Of Date,I'm not very satisfied with this book. It's a very basic and also out of date version of Home Automation techniques. It takes a very basic approach to home automation and does not offer much helpful info about current techniques.
2,In serious need of update,"With the pace home automation as been changing, this book should be considered ""out of date"" and hopefully soon be ""out of print."" While the author does seek to enlighten readers, the focus of the book is out-of-touch with main stream home automation thinking in 2002. Even the control systems referenced are no-longer near the cutting edge. While references to structured wiring still ring true, the techniques for reaching a total intregated system have changed. I was so disappointed with this book I actually returned to Amazon as I felt it could not enhance my library in any regard. As an alternative I would suggest ""Home Automation for Dummies."""
2,Very disappointing...,"The Pelican PM6 3320 flashlight worked great when it worked. The battery life in this product is extremly short. I bought a new battery for a weekend camping trip, used the light on & off (not extensively) throughout. Got home, placed it on my desk & 2 weeks later (with no use) it is 100% dead. It's almost as if the battery is always being drawn from, even while off. I would not have written this review except this is the second time this has happened since I bought this item. The 1st time was when I first recieved the light...only used it a couple of brief times, stored it...went to use it sometime later...dead. I would not recommend this product."
3,dot to dot,too small for little fingers. way too small to see and my 4 year old got bored as she couldn't see the dots nor could she manipulate the book.. we had to tear out the pages.. goes for all these tiny books
1,Terrible laptop,"I bought this computer before Christmas. It took 5 weeks to get sent to me. It has tons of shareware and does not function with Vista. In other words I was better off with my 5 year old Sony Vaio laptop than this one. Within 3 weeks the computer keyboard completely malfunction. With different caps turning on and off each time that I started my computer. It is now March 24, 2008 and I still have not got my computer back from their repair depot. Not to mention that the customer service is terrible. That is even comparing them to other terrible customer service such as Dell. I wanted to simply get my money back and they are unwilling to do this. I have left a review on many of the computers that have different configurations. I assume they are all junk and since I have been on hold 30 minutes (for the 5th time) I wanted to use my time wisely."
3,The Tofu Book is a fairly good tofu cookbook...,"The Tofu Book would be great for new vegetarians or people who are interested in cooking with tofu for the first time. It contains a nice history section in the front and an explanation of how to prepare tofu in a very detailed format. However, I do not think that the recipes are especially inventive. A number of the ingredients will most likely be confusing to newcomers. The book is not comprised of all vegetarian recipes, rather, I was rather surprised at the number of seafood recipes in the book. More marinades for tofu would have been helpful for people unaccustomed to the ""flavor"" of tofu. The major component lacking from this book is photographs - the entire book is in black and white."
4,pretty good game,didnt really keep me occupied long but the price I paid I think ten bucks was well worth it.
2,Raggedy Ann and Andy not in the story,"I wish i had known before buying this that this is NOT really a book of Raggedy Ann and Andy stories. It is a collection of quaint fairy tale-type stories originally written and illustrated by Johnny Gruelle in the 1920s, and so for the collector it may be interesting, but if you want stories with Ann and Andy, you would be disappointed. Also, it should be noted that this exact same book also appeared under a different title: ""Raggedy Ann's Fairy Stories."""
2,Fun for awhile but little replay value,"Growing up in the 70's the game of life boardgame was my favorite. My friends and I would play for hours, driving our little car around the 3 dimensional track and waiting for the chance to put our ""children"" pegs in the car (always biting the bottom off to make them shorter than the parents!). I was really looking forward to playing the PC version, but was kind of disappointed because the very things that make the boardgame fun are not present in the PC version. The biggest flaw is that you can't really see the entire board view, so you have no idea what squares are coming up. Half the fun of the boardgame is the satisfying sound of the wheel whirring, while you call out ""come on six!"", only to be disappointed when you land on 5. The graphics are amusing, and the game does have some entertainment value, but it just doesn't recapture the old board game."
5,One of the BEST games that I have EVER played! A total blast and family game!! I love it!!,"This is the best game! WAY more fun than the board game! It is so fun to see what your kids look like and to start a family get a career and to just play it!!! If you don't already have it, I strongly recommend it. If it went over 5 stars I'd give it a million. I have only played the computer game though. The computer game is a family game and totally F.U.N! So, if u like fun games-get this! I'm sure they're all equally fun. I'm trying to get one right now (: It's also for all ages."
2,okay game,it freezes up on me when i try and play enhanced game and when the gam is done and me or the computers have won it goes black
4,Wonderful game of life!,"I found this game to be very enjoyable! I especially loved the graphics! If you are looking for a game with great graphics ""the game of life"" would be my pick! Also, it's simular to the board game, ""LIFE."" One thing I didnt really enjoy about the game was how it takes awhile to fiish playing the game(about an hour). If you have a lot of time on your hands BUY IT! Over all it was great!"
4,Not bad -- not bad at all!,"My husband brought this game home because he was trying to find a Playstation game I would like. (I don't like the shoot-em-up games that he does.) It was cute! The movies are a little cheesy, but they did make us laugh. We played over and over again, just trying to land on new spaces so we could see the movies. The games gives you two ways to play -- the traditional way, where you collect Life tiles throughout the game; and an enhanced way, where you play little mini-games for money when you land on certain tiles. Both ways are fun, although the traditional way makes the end a little more interesting -- you're not sure who is going to win. A good family game, easy for even the technically-illiterate to understand."
4,Good songs,"I was pretty happy with the songbook in general. There are a lot of songs and for the price that is marked it's a VERY good deal. The only thing I was disappointed is that the songs in the live section are not the way she plays live at all. Just a reprint from the original versions. As far as the rest, they're very well transcribed. Very good for the price."
2,"It's not powerful, takes to long to dry hair",It takes so long to dry my hair with this hair dryer that I'm still using my old one with the taped up cord.
4,Decent blowdryer....,I say decent because I've owned other 1875 watt dryers that seemed to blow more air than this one does. Overall its not bad but I wouldn't buy it again.
5,Fun game to play.,The GTA series is a really well designed and really fun games. This box set it perfect to have all three games.
2,The 2 stars is not meant for the game entertainment...,"So, I just purchased this game yesterday at walmart, and I already have the three games on my memory card, but when I try loading the games, I get an error message and I have to restart each game over (which is the reason for my two star rating). But other than that, these games are more than fun, they are simply AMAZING!!!!!"
1,Ghastly,"I bought this for my 10 year old son because the father of one of his friends told me his son adored it. It is absolutely unsuitable for anyone under the age of 18. Much too much violence, profanity, etc for any child. I can not fathom how any responsible parent would ever let a child play these games.I personally found it repulsive even as an adult. Maybe there is some truth to the belief that by showing our children extreme violence we are telling them its OK."
5,Good Deal,"Bought as Christmas gift for 14 year old, addictive & fun! Some explicit language & sexual innuendo but still fun, for parents & teens!"
4,Old memories,I remember playing this games back when they where brand new playing them with my brother's and sisters i loved it. This is perfect for you if you want to remember what you loved. But my one fault is that if it's been a long time since you played them...it may be hard to go back comeing from the new great's like red dead redemption and gta 4
5,"Smells Amazing, and Cheaper than most stores","Love it, smells so good and about half the price of JC Penny or Macy's. Worth the money. However, I wasnt happy that it was listed as a prime and took a week to ship. If it cant be shipped within the 2 days Prime says, then it shouldnt be listed as Prime."
4,"Lacks depth that defines an rpg but, its fun none the less","When I first heard about BioMotor Unitron, I was pretty excited. An rpg on the NeoGeo Pocket Color, wow! But, when I got to playing the game I saw that it wasn't really an RPG. Sure it has the HP system and EXP. system, but it lacked a real plot. You go aroung these dungens and get money and experiance, but there was no real drive to the game except the making of new arms for the unitron. I do recomend taking a look at this game, but dont expect to much of a storyline."
4,BIOMOTR UNITRON..... is this game the next POKEMON,"NO...but many people of quite disapointed in this game. But how much can one small system give. Sure some of the things in the game can get to you like the no animation during the battles but what do u expect. The Neogeo is bringing the same graphics as a Super Nintendo , and thats pretty hard on such a small device. In BU ( Biomotor Unitron ) you start by picking a character then you go around meeting people . The game has tried to take the effect of POKEMON in thinking that a good RPG only has to consist of a good trade and collect plot...but this is wrong. Becuase of this people do not like the game becuase it has no real plot to it . but the game is highly addictive and to most people is very fun. And i think that if anyone wants a better game , you should either wait for BU 2 to come out or , get Card Fighters Clash for the Neo Geo aswell."
4,Solid RPG Fighter,"Okay, I admit I'm addicted to RPG. So, when I decided to get the neogeo pocket I was skeptical because there are not many of this genre for this system. Well, I am pleasantly surprised with the way you can make different arms from materials you find and equip your unitron the way you want. I can't wait for unitronII."
4,does everyone who reviews this in their right mind?,"Don't count on it, this game has awsome graphics and a pretty good story line. You are not a puny geek who has got to save the world( who likes that stuff anyway?). You are a person with a Unitron trying to become master of masters( winning a number of duels). This game should have a warning that says: warning, this game is very adictive. I played it non-stop from X-mas till now."
5,best game for neogeo ever,"this game will keep you playing for as long as your batteries can last-trust me i played it for 12 and a half of the 14 hours from indy to virginia beach!!! at first it is a little hard to understand, but once you understand it is sooooo fun"
3,Does the Job,"The book arrived on time and in new shape. As far as the contents are concerned, it should be required reading for those of us not leftists. Gramski wrote the rules by which some people live and fool others. Those being fooled already may consider it a handbook; others should use it as an antidote."
4,"Very Good, Accurate Mapping","This is an excellent reference and quick guide to the major battles and campaigns. I have found it more than useful when studying the War of the Revolution, and while not done in great detail, it gives enough information to begin a study of any campaign or major action of the war. It is excellently done, quite accurate, and while the maps are not done in painstaking detail, they are very well done-simply and to the point.This small, well done volume is highly recommended and anyone with more than a passing interest in America's war for independence from Great Britain will find it to be an excellent guide, especially when used alongside books of greater depth and whose maps are not as accurate as those contained in this volume."
1,"""In this slim volume""","OK, one star. MY copy of 'this slim volume' (Author's Intro, p1) is the size of, and seems like, a one hour National Geographic gazeteer of the War. Whole thing reads like a hastily written summary. Everything is terribly diluted and scanty. In my years of buying from Amazon, I've never felt really ""taken"" like this. Guess the other reviewers don't mind paying $30 for 100 pages. There's much better material that Amazon's got. Buy that, not this. Mine's being donated to the library."
2,Blah... missing something...,Short and sweet. I expected much more... and was given even less.Evanthericharddouglashouse.com (Rev War Veteran)
3,I'm not sure why this is so highly recommended,"This isn't a ""bad"" product, I just don't think it's the super-star product that so many other people seem to think it is. The directions say to apply DAILY, which is a hassle. And it peels off like crazy. If I try to smooth down any little nick, off comes half the finish. I've been using this a couple months and see absolutely no difference in my nails. But, they aren't any worse either."
3,So far I haven't seen any results..,"Hmm I ordered this and received it within three to four days i don't remember.. But anyways, I have been using this product for a week now and haven't seen no changes.. my nails are a little stronger but no different then they were before.. I use to bite my nails like crazy when I was in middle school, but now I'm 20 I don't bite them as often they're just short.. I hope I see progress soon or I'm going to be upset.. that this product was all hype smh.."
2,Misleading size,"Did not know product came in such a small size. Have been using the 1/2 fluid ounce & thought that is what I would get. The tiny 1/4 fluid ounce was priced just slightly lower than the others, so I thought I was getting a bargain. Wrong. Now I have more to check when buying on-line."
5,Excellent results!,"I started using this product after deciding to discontinue acrylic nails. My nails were brittle and flaking. I began to see significant improvement within just a few weeks of daily application. Expensive product, but worth it!"
1,"Horrible, stung and burned so bad!!","This product is horrible. Not sure if it actually works because i didn't use it more then twice to find out. The first coat I put on, it stung and burned my nails so bad, they felt like they were going to fall off, i couldn't stand the pain in my finger tips. I figured because i already had it on that it wouldn't hurt the second coat, but it did and it was worse. I couldn't stand it so I took it off right away with polish remover, they are still burning a bit after I removed the polish but Its not near as bad as with it on. My nails are very thin and fragile because I use to have on acrylic nails, so I wanted to try something to strengthen them back to healthy. I do not like this product and wouldn't not recommend it."
1,Pure garbage,"For some reason, my usually strong, long nails have been going through a period of chipping and peeling, so I fell for the Nailtique hype.Don't waste your money. It is pure junk. I followed the directions faithfully, but my nails are still chipping and the product is peeling off!!Don't believe everything you read about this scam."
5,If you've tried everything else.....,Do not hesitate to pick this up! My sister first used this last year and her nails used to be brittle from her biting them and never grew. Her nails are now longer than most acrylic tips and HARDER. I started using this a few weeks ago and my nails are stronger than ever and growing at a rapid speed. Try this before giving up!
4,Good quality,"This is a high quality guitar. The fretboard is really smooth, and the strings are pre-attached. I have no major complaints. However, it took me a while to realize, but I blamed a loud buzzing noise that the guitar had on a ""faulty"" amp, but the tech people at Yamaha told me to take the guitar/amp/amp cord away from computers and TVs. The buzzing stopped. You can merely turn off the TV or turn off the computer monitor for the same effect.Excellent product. Highly recommended."
2,problem,"Buzzes very very loudly unless you ground the bridge/strings/tuners by touching them. Some sort of wiring problem inside. This is my first guitar, so beyond that I can't say how good it is.Look at something else. I'll have to see if I can get it serviced by yamaha. Very annoying problem, I have to keep it turned down as low as possible to deal with the buzz and still hear some guitar sound out of the amp."
4,Great set but...,"I really love this set, I actually got it for 79.99 but would pay 99.99 easily. It is very cute. You get 2 pieces of matching art and 2 litle pictures you can frame yourself. As well as all the bedding and mobile and a lamp and little pillow for door. The mobile even plays music. I found it very easy to find matching pieces like extra sheets and a cover for changing pad. My only concern is that on my crib the bumper don't really fit around the crib very well- I just need to sew on longer string attachments on the puppy piece I think . OTher than that it's great"
3,Animal Cruelty!,"fun frolick that reminds women to make men jealous for them to fall in love... and don't forget that platinum ankle bracelet and the ever ready list of lovers with not one regular in the bunch... A+ for alliteration! Audrey was as always the shining star of the screen and every scene, Maurice FINALLY plays his age and I cannot believe they let that woman beat the dog, and who knows how many takes she did for what purpose, comedy??? ack, hard to recommend cept for Audrey fan, Coop was wasted in this one, maybe the final train kiss scene??? eh, maybe not..."
3,TCM Romance movies,"The movies Love in the Afternoon and Now Voyager were very good, however there were problems with the DVDs and we couldn't watch the endings. We're sending them in for replacement. Mogambo was good, but Splendor in the Grass was somewhat depresing."
2,Good ending but age difference is tiresome,"I dont care what anyone says,Im sick to death of much older men with very young girls. Yuck. He seemed ridiculous to me,the aging Romeo. After the appeal from her own father-he just had to rob the cradle anyway.I can think of scores of better actors than Cooper for that role. The orchestra following him everywhere was funny;but not enough of make this age difference palatable to me. There must be 30 years between them!"
3,The romantic classic I was expecting never appeared,"I'm a huge fan of old movies, and especially of Audrey Hepburn.She's proved how lovely and talented she is time and time again through such films as Breakfast at Tiffany's, Sabrina, My Fair Lady, Roman Holiday, Two for the Road, How To Steal a Million, etc.However, ""Love in the Afternoon,"" really fails to capture the essence of her other films. There is very little charisma and attraction between Cooper and Hepburn. Cooper looks like he's trying way to hard, and seriously the man looks almost in his 60's, and Miss Hepburn was in her 20's. Maurice Chevalier performed an excellent role, but it made me grimace because Cooper is only a few years younger than Chevalier. If they wanted to do the whole ""playboy"" thing, they didn't need to go for Hugh Hefner age. There is a lack of chemistry in this film, and although parts of it are charming, overrall, I felt let down."
4,A great romantic movie!,"This is a great movie for hopeless, sentamental romantics like me. It was a excellently casted and wonderfully acted. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I still cannot see what Aryanne(Hepburn)saw in that playboy(Cooper). It is still a wonderful romantic classic."
5,Glade you asked!,"This is a movie I have always loved......I ordered it thinking it was a CD and found that I oreded it on the cloud.....When I went to play it the picture did not fit the screen and the voice was completely off.....Amazaon gave me my money back and I reorded the disk.....again the CD has chineese script, very disappointing........Please note that the movie itself is what I love. If I could only see it the way it and all movies are seem........r"
5,Favorite Movie,This is one of the best movies ever! Just the way Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn interact/react in the movie makes it all that much better. Love is better in the afternoon.
1,Repulsive waste of Audrey Hepburn,"I was amazed that a movie that I had heard so much about was so awful. Audrey Hepburn is wasted in a roll that casts her as an idiot. Gary Cooper is a totally inappropriate co-star. He is clearly desiccated, something not hidden by the careful lighting, side angles and shadows cast on his face. He moves like an old man, stiff and wooden. His voice is squeaky. Cooper shows every indication of alcoholism.Amazing, because Fred Astaire was probably the same age as Cooper, if not older, but in Daddy Long Legs he is charming, as well as honestly lighted. Perhaps this is because his glorious elegance and athleticism did not escape him."
3,Love in the Afternoon,"Audry Hepburn was a delight, as usual, however, the old lady in this movie keeps yelling, ""bad dog, bad dog"" and hitting the poor little puppy throughout the movie. The dog was obviously drugged (heavy dose) because it merely winces and jumps when hit but doesn't yelp.I threw my copy of this movie in the trash!!"
3,"Very Dated, But Worth Watching","The three stars are Gary Cooper as American multi-millionaire Frank Flannagan, Audrey Hepburn as cello-playing student Ariane Chavasse, and Maurice Chevalier as her private detective father Claude Chavasse. It takes place in Paris, and I suppose that forgives a lot of corn, but you have to take plenty of marks off for the extraordinarily tiresome gypsy quartet and the utterly unbelievable plot. Also, I did not find the running joke about the little dog who keeps getting spanked for things which are not his doing.It would be an utterly worthless movie if it weren't for its three stars. They should have been given a much, much better script."
5,Romance TCM classical films....wonderful,"All four movies are great, just as if you were watching in the old movie theaters. Brings back memories. My mother is wheelchair bound and enjoys watching these over and over again. Thanks for putting 4 movies in one to save space. I love the whole package.....thanks for thinking of us consumers."
2,Disappointed,"I was only able to watch one of the 4 movies Love in the Afternoon, which was pretty good. I guess it is my fault I should have read reviews before purchasing. If there was a way to get back my money I would request it."
4,A great love story for those with deeper feelings,"Great stars appear in this B & W film . It is an extreme expression of romanticism. At the time it was felt and therfore failed, that the age difference between the lovers was too great, a la Sean and Catherine, however the presence of the players makes this a lovely affair. As in Charade there is scant physical conatct which makes the story more poingant, allowing the imagination to enhance Wilder's work."
2,Granddad gets his,"I'm sorry, but as much as I adore Audrey and as much as I adored (note past tense) Gary, by the time he made this movie, he looked like he needed to be dusted off and Audrey still had the ingenue, stick-figure, innocent doll look. I almost upchucked when he kissed her. I am well aware there are many, many older men/younger women romances. I don't have anything against them, per se, but WHAT is it that she would have seen in him... except his wrinkles? I know I'm being cruel, and I'm no spring chicken, but I didn't sense any sparks between the two of them. I saw Audrey's face before the Coop goes in for a kiss... and it was: ""Okay, I have to kiss him, let's make this good."" The cover of the DVD looks like Grandpa is holding his debutante granddaughter. This was some old studio lecher's idea of a hot film. The public went to it because that's what they were given. I can't imagine this kind of film being a hot property now, but what do I know?"
5,Wonderful actors and interesting plot & dialogues,"I have seen this movie in an English movie theater in Vienna and fell in love with this film the minute it started.I love the plot in which the cello student, Arianne falls in love with one of her dad's surveillance 'victims', Mr. Flannagan, only by seeing him on a photo and then getting to know him through fate. I also love the dialogues between them and seeing him turn into a man who denies that he is in love almost until the end of the movie, of which he hasn't been in a long time, only because of her being mysterous but emotionally honest. I also like that there is such a large age difference which makes it even more interesting. All in all a fantastic movie."
4,"You'll love ""Love in the Afternoon!""","As the title says, you'll absolutely love this infectious romantic comedy starring Audrey Hepburn, Gary Cooper, and Maurice Chevalier. Hepburn plays an innocent girl Arianne who falls in love with American playboy, Frank Flanagan(Cooper). Arianne's father(Chevalier) is a detective specializing in extra marital affairs, and especially in those involving Mr. Frank Flanagan. With its twists and turns and lively Gypsy band, ""Love in the Afternoon"" is a film of wit, romance, and delightful music that will charm generations to come!"
3,A Pleasant Romantic Comedy,"This is not classic Billy Wilder. The film is too long, and suffers from some lulls. Maurice Chevalier doesn't have enough to do. Gary Cooper looks tired, and is mismatched next to the vibrant Audrey Hepburn. The scenario is interesting, and there are some lovely moments. Overall, the film is good, but not extraordinary. For a better Wilder romantic comedy, try ""A Foreign Affair."""
2,Love in the Afternoon,"Pleasant movie but nothing special, a very ordinary story. Audrey Hepburn's charisma is what puts some life to the movie. Some subtle humour though."
2,Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper do NOT make a good couple!,Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper are wonderful actors but should never have been paired together. There should be a believeble age difference. Audrey's calling him the best looking man she'd ever seen is NOT believable. The plot is decent but I didn't like Cooper's gigilo character. Audrey is stunning as usual.
3,love in the afternoon,"Audrey Hepburn, always lovely, couldn't possibly have fallen for a man who looked as old as Gary Cooper. Apart from that, I thought the supporting actors were good, the script was good, the directing was good. Too bad about Gary Cooper."
1,A tragedy disguised as a love story,"This movie helps us to understand why the divorce rate is so high amongst this generation. The story line is written to depict a great love founded on lies and deceit. Cooper plays a skirt chasing, immoral, philanderer, who has absolutely no depth of character and nothing positive to offer, other than financial security. Hepburn portrays an idiot child who can't see what a loser she pursues. The differences in their ages could suggest that Cooper is a child molester. I found this movie disturbing and annoying."
2,enh,"""Love in the Afternoon"" was distracting at best, and banally charming at worst. It could barely hold my attention during dinner. The dialogue attempts to be the sort of heated exchange substituting for heated sex, but instead falls flat because the script is just simply trying too hard to capitalize on Audrey Hepburns' innate coquettishness. Enh. Nothing stood out about this movie."
3,Physco female blowing up the phone lines,"Sorry but I just couldn't get into this movie. The whole part of the movie where she is in love and the man just plays her. This movie is like hitting your finger with a hammer,just not good."
5,Fun game,"This game may be five years old, but it is still fun. You get three environments and three cars. With the editor, the possibilities are endless. I definitely recommend this game."
5,fun,My son wanted this so bad..we searched and searched for it and finally had gotten it. He liked it so much that he had to get a second copy to multiplay. Thats why we got this one.
5,Trackmania,"If you love the trackmania stuff, you'll like this one too. It was bought as a gift and they loved it."
4,trackmania,I just bought this game last night after being a big fan of the first game and this version is much improved.The graphics are probably the most obvious difference from the previous game and the driving surfaces are more varied and detailed. The driving physics also are more responsive than the first and each type of car really handles in a unique way.It was a great game before and it looks to be even greater this time out.
4,"WELL, TRACKMANIA STRIKES AGAIN!","Well, the world needs to face it. THIS GAME IS AWESOME! The pros and cons are:PROS: Great graphics, and sound!Awesome tracks/track editor!FAST AND FURIOUS!!!this game will last you FOREVER!!!!CONS: Trackeditor complex at first, some pieces IMPOSSIBLE to figure out.Otherwise, PERFECT!Hope this helped you,HAPPY PLAYING!"
5,Mad Cow Disease and The Dermis Probe,"One of the many gems in this book is ""The Legend of The Cattleman"". The cattle expert arrived in a country where the local specialists in cows and oxens reported ""such animals become sick and die very frequently, in spite of all our science"". He asked them how did they feed and treat the animals. In the end he had to feed the cattle what the local people considered right but secretly he also fed the cattle what they really needed. Could some of these old stories anticipate contemporary science?"
4,Paganini is Ok But Wieniawski is wonderful,I only Gave this album 4 stars because I did not like the way that the Paganini was Performed it was a very boring and dull playing style. But I did enjoy the Wieniawski greatly. The Wieniawski was played very Beutifuly. The romantic movement was very enchanting and moving. The album was well worth the money for three dollars you can't beat it.
4,"Finally, a very good Network Storage device","I bought this product last week and I am, so far, VERY happy.Here are some of the reasons:1. Had it up a running in less than 10 minutes.2. No problem for me that you need to install a driver which also installs a very easy/friendly user interface. (most all other devices I buy and come home with also require me to insert the CD and install something)3. Performance is more than acceptable. In fact, it is faster than 2 other NAS devices I have in our offices; Buffalo and Maxtor4. I REALLY like the fact that the volumes show up as a letter drive, i.e. D:E:F: drives. All of my existing apps can handle and use this immediately.So far, VERY happy and satisfied.Charlie"
2,"No way, never again!","I purchased the SC101 over a year ago and it worked fine for the majority of that time. However a month ago I upgraded the software and firmware on the device and lost access to all of my data. NetGear support was of little help. Reading the support forums on the NetGear site one suggestion was to buy another SC101 and insert the drives in an attempt to recover the data, this unfortunately did not work. I am still without my data and repeated attempts for support from NetGear have been horrible.I work in the IT profession for a living and I strongly advise you to look elsewhere for a good ""reliable"" NAS solution. This is not a knock against Amazon, the purchase and timely delivery of my order was very good. The product however is very unstable and the customer support is the worst I've ever experienced. I will not purchase NetGear products in the future if I can avoid it."
1,Would not install. Then no support.,"Spent hours trying to install and receiving ""Failed to install Z-San Bus"" error (whatever that is). I downloaded several different versions of the Management application and all failed to install on WinXP. Netgear website leads you in circles and you are unable to reach any email or phone support unless you buy it. I will not be purchasing any more Neatgear equipment either for home or for the office network as it does not appear to be a wise investment."
1,Painful experience,"I had a very bad experience with this product. I was able to get it to work with one drive in the unit. When I tried to install the second drive, I could not net it to recognize the full storage. I had this running on a home network with NetGear powerline carrier. Guess what, they are incompatible. I found that after I installed the software on my Vista and XP Pro machines, I could not get a clean shutdown. I kept getting an error message that there was a mirroring conflict when I tried to install it on a third machine. I finally ended up uninstalling the software and taking the SC101 offline. I no longer had the shutdown problem. Bad news..."
2,"Terrible software, and so I would avoid","I've had the SC101 for about 9 months now, but have finally decided to remove it from my system and go with non-networked USB drives instead. The software that controls this box (which MUST be installed in order to access it) is very poorly implemented - I would say circa 1990 (Windows 3.0) quality, if that.The deciding factor for me was when the firmware upgrade aspect of the software (which the software prompts you to run ***each*** time you open it) crashed during the firmware upgrade. If you don't know the significance of such a crash, the answer is short: likely inability to access the device or any of the data stored on either drive inside. In my case, the unit was still functional after the firmware upgrade crash, but I am not willing to risk continuing to use it."
1,BAD PRODUCT....Had to go another route!,"I bought this product about a year ago. After six months I had a computer failure. I was relying on this product as a backup for all my personal files. When I went to re-attach the drive to restore my files, the unit failed. My computer could see the SC101 on th network, but it showed no available drives to attach. I was finally able to reformat and start over, but lost ALL my data.Well, 3 months later.......it happened again. Now I am buying a simple HDD enclosure. I won't be able to use it on the network but at least I will be able to salvage my hard drive."
1,PATHETIC!,"Software/driver has tons of bugs. I bought it when it first came out and it just seemed like I was testing the prodcuting and providing feedback to tech support.When it shuts off, sometimes it does not come back online. I have to unplug it and re-plug for it to come back online. It took about 6 months for netgear to come out with firmware that was compatible with Windows Vista.It only takes IDE hard drives. All the new drives out there are SATA. I'm going to auction it off and get probably the D-Link network storage."
1,Dont Buy!!,"First off know that this is considered a SAN instead of a NAS, so Windows will not be able to read the data if you attach the drive directly. Not good for most home users. But aside from that this is a horrible product that I wouldnt give to my enemies. The mirroring doesn't work correctly and it has a hard time detecting the drives even when it seems to be working fine. If you like losing valuable data, please buy it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have this unit with a 250GB now for over 18 months, here are the reasons why you should not buy it:1. very slow performance2. unit runs very hot3. proprietary format, you will not get your data off it if you take the harddrive out4. does not work under Vista at all (new firmware posted after 10 month of driver unavailability is full of bugs and still does not work)5. worst customer support"
1,Don't waste your money,This is a lousy product. Has lots of bugs and service support is useless. Buy some other brand NOT this one. I gave this a 1 star rating because there is no -5 rating.
1,You're not that poor - buy a better unit,"I've had this product for several months. I bought it to save money, but I bought myself mostly aggravation instead.Pros:* Easier setup than a full computer.* Does indeed store the files and allow them to be accessed by more than one Windows PC.* Hasn't killed a drive yet.* Partitions can be resized.* Quiet.Cons:* Slower than dirt; copying files takes a ton of time.* Windows-only.The performance is a big killer. I have a 54Mbps wireless network, and operations such as saving that should take just a few seconds stretch into minutes. I have no idea what this thing is doing, but it takes forever to do even the simplest tasks. The performance is reminiscent of floppy drives.My wife got me another hard drive as a gift, and though the unit can take another drive, I can't bear to put it in. I'm shopping for a NAS device that uses Samba, so I can retire this piece of junk."
1,How could Netgear release this product with its flaws?,"While the box says the SC101 works with ""drives of any size from any vendor"", that is both blatantly false and something Netgear knew to be blatantly false: as Netgear's own website says ""No ATA-5 or earler drives work"", and possibly not all ATA-6 drives!! It is a shameful ommision that this is not listed on the box or in any requirements. It is beyond believable that Netgear felt it was OK to sell a box like this and that their engineering was unable make it work. There are many other problems with this box, (see their own site and others complaints). Netgear has done a very poor job in addressing these issues with me. I am a software engineer myself and ask why Netgear would allow it's reputation to be damaged by offering a product like this: getting it so wrong, but still letting it out the door. There are many other products that provide this function without the insane problems and restrictions"
1,Don't waste your money.,"Although, I reviewed this product before purchase and I knew it would be slooow, it is really very very slow and fails to connect most of the time. You are required to install software on each system that needs access. On the two systems that I have installed the software on have had nothing but problems since. Worst yet the hard drive that you install in the box is rendered useless be used again in any other type of system. Look elsewhere for a NAS."
1,"Avoid this item, poor design and even worse software","This was a mistake from the beginning: Proprietary disk formatting!! Poor cooling of enclosure, will cook your drives (Band new Seagate 400GB 7200RPM Drive)!! Software installation seems so easy, if you like seeing the Windows XP bluescreen with errors!!!! Tech support was limited, and the language barrier was clearly too much for the consumer to handle!!! My recommendation is not to buy this product, Netgear can and has done better in the past. If you already own this and you can return or exchange it, do so ASAP to avoid loosing precious data."
1,"Penny wise, pound foolish","I bought this unit to get inexpensive RAID 5 storage on my small office network. It worked fine for six months, until I had to reinstall the drivers on a reformatted computer. Not only will the drivers not install, but the installer fails with a message box titled ""Error"" that says ""Installation failed--that's it nothing else, no clue as to what went wrong.Spend your money on something that uses a standard TCP/IP connection, rather than non-standard, proprietary drivers. when it works, it's fine. but unfortunately, it doesn't always work."
2,NAS / Hot Plate,"This little gadget runs hot. However, this is besides the point. I just got it two days ago and it really is not up to the challenge. Write speeds are very slow, especially if mirroring is enabled. Tech support, well don't get me started, but you'd be better of talking to a brick wall. They know little about the product and in case of doubt they always balme your equipment first your router, network card, processor speed, etc...I bought this unit because of NetGear's reputation in this field, but I think I'll build my own file server and return this one."
2,"Great idea, but didn't work. Nightmare.","I loved the idea and the product, if it had only worked. After installing (with two new drives), I had all sorts of issues - not being able to see the drives, reinstalling numerous times, different files visible from different computers. I spent ages on the phone with many tech support people, and it still never worked right. Then all the installing/uninstalling finally corrupted my windows and caused me days to recover. Finally I had to send it back. Such a nightmare. Too bad - seemed to be just what I wanted."
1,Boo for the SC101,"As a computer dork, I wanted to get a little storage device for my home network. 5 hours after I began the ""10 minute"" process of getting the SC101 up and running... and all I had to show for it was a lot of frustration and no working ""microSan."" If you are dead-set on getting one of these, please make sure to read the netgear support pages thoroughly first as the description on the box seems wildly different than what is actually supported by the device."
2,Find something better,"At first, I thought I was buying a low cost, low engergy network storage drive. Yes, it is low cost and it does consume less energy than my old tower computer I was using for network storage. However, now that I have it set up and running, this is not what I wanted.First, you need to install a device driver on every computer that will access this device. This is insane! Your computer will not see this as simply network storage without the device driver.Second, if you have pre-loaded hard drives - forget it - the driver needs to reformat each drive, so all you material is lost! Make sure you back everything up first.Last - it's slow! Access time is very slow. I was running a WinXP machine as my network storage, and even with the operating system running in the background, that computer had much faster access to the data. I thought a dedicated unit would speed up transfer, but not with this device.Look for a faster unit, pay some additional money. I'm disappointed."
1,Unmitigated disaster (or: should have listened to 80% of reviewers a long time ago),"NetGear typically makes decent products. Not this one.There have been longstanding and widely reported problems, many of which are crippling under Vista. One example are transfer speeds which slow to such a crawl that Vista locks up. Only hard boots help. Similar issues existed under XP (ironically less so which is actually a Vista file copy issue).My SC101 has effectively become un-usuable. With both drives being full I have to delete backup files (anywhere from 5-50 GB). The only way to do so is to break down delete processes into small increments of 50-100 MB to avoid above.Otherwise slow overall, drive attachment could be much easier, and support is found in user groups but not from NetGear.Good NAS backup drives starts at around $ 150, a good - and large - basic external hard drive via UBS can be had for well under $ 100."
2,Sufficient but not superior,"I need something to back up all of my home office files. I want something that will serve up movies and music to my entire network. File backup - check...serve up music - sorta...serve up movies - don't bother. In fact, I bought a USB drive for music and movies and just drag it around when needed. The software was a joke when I bought it and it has not gotten much better. I thought I lost everything twice during firmware flashes. I now own (yet another) 500 GB USB drive that I keep in my fire safe and perform bi-monthly backups of the backup. My purposes would have been better served with 2 500 GB USB drives since the ""NAS"" aspect of music and movie streaming is not really met. Live and learn."
1,Check it out before buy.,"Check it out before buy. Not all drive works, dont works in linux or mac. and it have a lot of but the software that use.Ahh the service support doesn't work."
1,terrible software,"I'm a computer manager in my day job and wanted the reliability of a simple RAID after my old NAS died. I ordered this unit expecting the usual Linux-based operating system, but this runs their own specialized software, with a specialized format on the drives.You cannot access the drive without running the software and the software is terrible - 2 of 3 XP machines would not recognize the drives and the third had trouble every few reboots. All of this proprietary software means you're stuck if anything goes wrong.After several weeks of frustration trying to get the system working on all three computers, I gave up and returned it. I'll buy one that uses Linux and standard network shares!"
1,No Vista support,"I was hoping for a device that would let me put my harddrive onto my network. Sounds easy enough. This is limited on the drives you can use. doesn't support windows Vista, requires you to install software on each machine you want to use it with.Overall it makes things a lot harder than they should be."
2,Basic file sharing...a little undependable.,"For basic file sharing with only Windows PCs, where speed is not an issue, and 100% uptime is not a requirement, this is an OK product.As noted, using it requires loading driver SW on all computers that need to access the drives, and the software doesn't always connect properly, and can conflict w/other software on your computer.I used an SC101 for six or seven months, but in the end the slow file transfer speed, occassional dropped connections, and conflicts w/other software finally drove me to the point that I needed to make a change. I got a DNS-323 from Amazon...been a really great change.If you're looking for a real NAS box w/excellent speed and features, trouble-free connections, ability to enhance it and add additional features go with the DNS-323.D-Link DNS-323 2-Bay Network Storage EnclosureThere is even an active user community forum for the DNS-323 at [..]"
2,Stay Away from This Product,"I've had an SC101 for almost a year.When it works, it is SUPER. When it doesn't, support is poor and you are really on your own. I've had three different issues affecting data from three different machines accessing it over the past months. None of the issues are discussed in the troubleshooting guide, nor in the FAQ, and email tech support has been completely unhelpful.I've been able to salvage my data each time (yes, ultimately I had it backed up and could recover if needed), but the stability and support of the device makes it impossible for me to recommend it to anyone who feels they are an average home user. (I am a fairly technical user and have never had this kind of trouble with a PC product.)"
3,It's okay if only...,"The product is okay. I got it up and running within 30 minutes. My only gripe is if you leave it on continuously, it will lock up (the harddisk light will remain steady red) and it cannot be found anymore. I always have to power it off then on again for it to work again. As it is a network drive, you expect it to be always on and always ready when you need it."
1,Slow storage,"This device looked good on paper but when I received it I was very disappointed. Installation was easy but file transfer is pathetic. I thought I'd try to back up an 8Gb data file which took 8 hours. Back up of my laptop took 46 hours. I also have 2 Mac's on my network but no drivers are available. The disk format is alien and Net gear only.Very, Very, Very disappointed.Netgear need to get their act together ang upgrade what could be a great solution."
2,Poorly engineered product,"This item is portrayed as a Network attached storage device. It is not! The only way to access the drives in the unit is with Netgear's software, which by the way does not work to well. The SC101 kept detaching itself even with the current firmware and could not be re-attached unless you re-booted the unit. I am returning the SC101 for a refund."
1,Horrible !,I hardly understand haw a company like Netgear can make something like this and try to sell it. After 2 weeks of testing & configuring & patching & firmware changing i lost all my dataand can't make any use of my hdd anymore.
1,If you want to LOSE your precious files buy this!,"I purchased the SC101 as a filestore for my friends lawfirm and set it up about a year ago. Boy was it the worst thing I ever did for his business. I remember the install being a rather unfriendly process. A few days ago his Admin calls me to say they are having some sync trouble, but the files are still there. So I go in yesterday and upgrade the firmware and PC software as per the instructions on [...] .The damn thing set the drive size to 0 MB and killed the partition. Tech support told me the device was defective and outside warranty even though just prior to upgrading the files were there. Now the law firm has lost all of its client files that were on there.Do yourself favor and dont get this thing. If you want to throw money away paypal it to me!"
4,SC101 Works Great....after some troubleshooting,I had a bunch of trouble getting this drive to attach to 2 of my computers. After checking everything I realized that the Integrity (Zone Alarm) Firewall was a couple of revions old on both PCs. After updating the firewalls the drive works perfectly. Very happy with it now.
2,don't upgrade firmware,"Customer service was great. But the mere fact that my data storage has to be reformatted makes me realize this was a bad purchase. This happened after i upgraded my firmware. Before that I was able to get my files fine. My PC started to crash occasionally tho. Since I upgraded the firmware and reformatted the drives, the PC doesn't freeze anymore. I am happy that I'm now able to access my pictures and music with my pc and my laptops."
1,All promise and little delivery,"I have had the box 1 week now. It only works with XP computers. My Apple and Vista ones are out of luck. Vista has hope (someday), but the unusual architectural choice of SAN vs NAS makes OS X very unlikely ever. I have had one broken mirror, and have had it lose connectivity with its own disks once (could be IDE disks I bought). The SAN thing is the big loss though. It means you can't mount the drives on even XP laptops or XP desktops without using the supplied (non-WHQL'd I might add) drivers (let alone OS X or Linux). I feel snookered."
3,It's what I expected,"This is an out of date storage hub that Netgear no longer support. It is not Windows 7 compatible nor Windows 8. It is only compatible Windows XP. I used to have this but unlike thousands of disgruntled others, it actually fried due to overheating as there is no internal fan to keep it cooled. I losted one hard drive as well as this hub. But I only bought this so I can recover my datas on one hard drive. You cannot recover the data without the hub!!!! It is formatted using the zetera software and they will not support this either. Put it this way, after they sold thousands of this cool gagdet at the time, they got mad at each other (one sued the other, forget which) and neither will support the products, Do not buy this unless you had one just to get your stuff off and throw it away before it destroys anything new. I am happy that I got stuff off one drive. I might sell this to whomever need it to retrieve data but I haven't lost hope in recovering data on my other drive..."
3,Windows only,"This product is only ok. works on network with windows machines, but it is slow. However as it requires windows only software install on each machine, if you use a Mac or Linux (I have both in my network) the only way to access it is through another windows computer as a shared drive, thus defeating a network attached drive. If you use linux or OSX stay away."
1,Never Buy NetGear Products!!,"This was purchased in hopes of simply setting up a NAS for data backup. Ooops! SHould have read the reviews. Netgear is Useless - no support, Poor products. I fought with this useless POC for hours... days. Never got it to work. Just threw my money away.Look at the reviews here and LEARN!! Stay away from Netgear - they serve up useless junk.Anyway, next (after reading reviews) I bought a Synology NAS. WOW!! Fantastic - up in minutes. Shows what a Quality product can deliver.Bottom line - DO NOT BUY NETGEAR!!!Good Luck!"
3,Simple NAS device,I bought my SC101 back in 2007. It is a simple NAS device that requires loading the Netgear storage manager on your Windows XP computer (not compatible with Windows 7). Its transfer rate over a wired connection is approximately 50 Mbps. Over wireless G approximately 25Mbps.The reason I gave it 3 stars is that its technology is dated. It accepts only PATA (IDE) drives (2 bays). I would recommend that you spend the additional dollars and buy a newer product. Back in the day this was a superb device but in todays environment it is out of date.
2,"Works, but multiple shortcomings","The SC101 does enable one to take IDE hard drives and make them available on the network.However, it doesn't work with Windows 7 or anything other than Windows XP and Vista.It uses a proprietary file system, so it cannot be accessed directly. You must install the Netgear software to enable a Windows PC to see the drive.Very clunky solution, much better alternatives at less cost."
4,Excellent storage system for XP (but not Vista or 7),"This unit would rate 5 stars if only Netgear had decided to provide W-7 drivers. Installation was simple and the units are quite stable (have 2 with 500gb in each). Hooking up to a network is a no-brainer but you will have to install Netgear's propriety drivers and utilities on all your PCs to access and manage the drives.Since installation, I have had no down-time issues and every XP computer works well with the boxes. As we are converting to W-7 units, I may have to excess these boxes but only because Netgear does not have, nor do they plan to release updated drivers."
1,Agree with all of the bad reviews,"I agree with all of the bad reviews, the only reason I am adding my review is to note that when the unit dies in a few months, and it will, you will not be able to recover the information stored on your drives. I had to by a second one just so I could recover files stored on the drives. At least the second one was cheep enough ($23.00), compared to the $200 I paid for the first one."
1,Not supported in Vista or Windows 7,"This was actually a pretty nice product. At the original price it was a real deal a few years ago. Unfortunately, there have been no upgrades to the drivers. This means no Vista or Windows 7 support.Also consider that special software needs to be installed on all computers that wish to access this device. Otherwise, it will NOT be accessible by that computer.So, unless you are an old-time hacker who will keep all his network in XP, stay away."
1,This toaster has only one setting....sloooooow!!!,"I cannot believe this is the worst toaster ever!!! It is the new year and I thought ""Hey I need to get a really bangin toaster!"", ya know? but this is not the toaster for you if you are thinking this. First of all the slots are on the bottom and YOU CAN""T GET THEM OPEN when you plug them in!!! There is no darkness settings either but my friend says thats why it knows how to toast anything to perfection. Can someone explain why there is an internet connection. Do people really toast across their network? And you can forget about the instructions, they did not help at all. I never am buying a non-chrome toaster again!!!"
3,Netgear SC101 - OK not great,I purchase the device and it was detective. Amazon replaced it. Device works but you need to install the software on all device that need to access it. Time will tell if it is worth the price.
2,Wish it were a whole lot better....,"I used it with my home network (US Robotic wireless router). No trouble setting it up or mapping. However, initially it was very, very slow and caused my laptop to crash frequently. It took me quite a while to figure out that it is my firewall (CA Internet Security and Micro Trend Internet Secuirty). I have to drop my firewall every time when I want to access this unit. I also have a Linksys NSLU2 in the same network, no firewall issues."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VISTA,"As of mid-February 2007, Netgear has not made available drivers for this product to work with Vista. So, if you have any thoughts of maybe upgrading your operating system, check and make sure drivers have been made available. The XP drivers do not work.Before I upgraded to Vista, the product worked pretty well. But, it's amazing to me that a current product like this does not have drivers for Vista. (Maybe Netgear hadn't heard that Microsof was coming out with a new operating system?)"
1,HORRIBLE DEVICE,"NETGEAR REALLY LET THEIR CUSTOMERS DOWN WITH THIS ONE. AFTER THIS DEVICE, I WILL SECOND GUESS EVERY NETGEAR PURCHASE EVER. MAYBE NETGEAR MAKES A DECENT HUB, BUT THIS TECHNOLOGY SEEMS WAY BEYOND THEM AND THEY COMPLETELY FAILED.I LOST MY RECEIPT AND CANNOT RETURN IT. I AM THROWING THIS IN THE TRASH BRAND NEW. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME/MONEY."
4,Nice little network Storage System,"Had no issue getting it installed. Just popped in an extra 250 gig hard drive I had laying around. I did need to download the latest drivers and firmware. We are able to connect to it from both our XP and Vista PC. My only complaint, while minor, is that its performance is a little slower that I would have expected. However it gets the job done and my family loves being able to store and share their photos, home videos and other files. For the price it's a good deal."
1,Do NOT buy this product,"The product works as advertised, that's not the problem. The problem is what's not advertised. Basically, it uses a proprietary system, so you need to install software in whatever computer you want to access it. The drivers are only for Windows XP (some say it's worked for them on Vista with some registry changes and what not). And it definitely doesn't work in Windows 7 or any 64 bit version of any OS. So basically, this product is as obsolete as obsolete goes. Netgear abandoned any support for this unit a few years ago, so don't even bother contacting them. It's also very slow."
2,Great intentions but product falls miserably short!,"I won't go too in depth here, there are already plenty of reviews that sum up this device...NOT WORTH IT! I got it for $29.95 and i'm getting rid of it. First of all it's PATA (IDE) and doesn't work with all harddrives. PATA is fine however prices for PATA are about 25% higher than SATA, probably because they are being phased out. The worst part about this is that the firmware needs to be upgraded to work in Vista and many times the upgrade will fail. Also, all computers you want to access this drive must have software on them. Other bad things include drive format not readable in Windows, that means if this thing crashes, or if a drive crashes (and the mirroring doesn't always save your data!) your are up s**t creek without a paddle if you know what I mean. Get a Pogoplug instead! I pre-ordered! http://www.pogoplug.com"
1,requires newer drives,"It appearred esy to setup. The docs said ""requires an IDE drive"" so I plugged one in (an old one). It didn't work and I found this in the help:""If the green LED blinks 4 times at 1~2 second intervals, there is an ATA5 or older IDE hard disk plugged to SC101 that is not supported. SC101 works only with ATA6 or newer IDE hard disks."""
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I have used this device for 1 year and 4 months. I have had success at using it but... I have had far more problems than I care to say. I am writing this because I had the device working, they prvided updates. The updates failed to work even on the original machine using SCM software that was working. I have owned two other companies ""nas"" products. They work. They were supported. In short, their software is written poorly. if it works poorly with XP, I can't wait to see it under Vista. Their device is really nothing more than a piece of junk. Used @ $42.00 is a rip off. Also don't ask for support unless you want to pay for it and wait. The netgear support staff varies in knowledge and the English language.It's junk, don't waste your money."
2,SLOW,"I thought this was a great idea. Now I wish I hadn't bought it. It is very slow, sometimes I have to wait up to 30 seconds for the drive folder to open once I click on it. If you didn't read the fine print, you have to install software on every computer that you want to access the SC101, then you have to attach the drives. It isn't like having a network drive that you just attach. I thought this device would help me reduce power consumption by turning off my server, but I am seriously thinking about moving back to the server."
1,nice looking paper weight...,"Pros: Nice looking, cheap, compact..Cons: CHEAP! real slow. has a lot of driver problems. slows down some systems after installing its drivers. not reliable.. waste of time and money."
1,This unit is a Windows PC Terminator. Believe the bad reviews!,"This unit caused my Windows XP sp2 PC to hang on shutdown. After the power was re-set; the PC never came back to life. I had to wipe out windows and start over. This cost many hours.I returned the item, less a restocking fee, to Amazon. Believe me, the restocking fees was small compared with the time cost of rebuilding the PC.I noticed at least two other people have had this problem. Total system crashes are big deals!"
1,Excellent Concept - Brittle Product - Poor Support,"I bought this product on the recomendation of a CompUSA employee. It seemed to work fine when I installed it on the network and added the software to a computer on a hard line. On my first wireless installation attempt I could not see the drives (partitions) and no matter what else I have done I cannot fix this problem. I called tech support and as much as I like talking to people overseas I found the imprecise english tough to deal with. The tech support agent made bizarre comments like ""if you have a 100gb partition on the SC101 to mount it you need 100gb free space on you laptop"". This is just ridiculous. Now I am very worried about storing may data here because of all of the other negative reviews. My data is too important to risk."
4,Great debut,"Terrific debut album. Kendel has a nice soulful voice, and the instrumentals on this album don't drown it out. She does some up-tempo stuff as well as some excellent ballads. My favorite cut is Ribbons and Bows. I heard it on XM radio and had to hear more."
4,Really good for the price!,"Got it as guitar ampli for a nylon-string spanish guitar (Ibanez electroacoustic one). The Behringer for electroacoustic guitars is good mostly for metal-string ones. This ampli is quite good (not excelent) for metal-string electroacoustic, excelent for voice and keyboards, and I also use to conect an iPod or any MP3 player into it (get a RCA to mini-plug cable, plus two RCA to mono plug adaptors), powerful stereo sound but without panning (minor downside). You have to keep it clean, since you will notice that the EQ has no internal protection against dust. Also, be careful with the effects button, it's really cool as a basic source of effects but sometimes it does not responds, just a matter of taking the cap out and placing again on the controller."
1,Worst thing Fisher-Price Ever made,"This is so bad I don't know what to say. The box says 24 months. My 4 year old can't put it together. It pictures it on a carpet don't even try it. We have had it on the table, concret floor, plywood and wood floor. Hard to get even so the train runs. Stops at every bump which is at every piece, then when we finally got it to run around the track with out stopping or shooting off the track it would only partially do it's thing at the stops, Usually it would stop but not stop to let the characters off. I'd buy something else."
1,I am calling to demand a safety recall!,"I need a zero star option!!I bought this for my daughter last December on her 2nd birthday and it has been a hit. However, today she was playing with it and put it on her arm and one of the wheels pinched her skin right up into the toy and it would not come off. SHe came to me screaming with the train stuck on her arm. She actually yanked it off before I could turn it off and it left a bruise and a small cut. I will call Fisher Price on Monday and report this problem."
5,"The best toy ever, for girls & boys!!",My Daughter got it few days ago and she does not stop playing with it. She is so excited and talking a lot to it. She is only 2 years old and very much in love with it. Very recommended.
1,Biggest piece of junk - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This has to be one of the worst pieces of junk you could buy. My son recieved this ""toy"" for christmas. Big waste of money. All the ""wooden"" pieces were warped. When connecting any two pieces together the grooves the train runs along do not align. We have tried putting the tracks on the bare floor, table top, and carpet. Nothing works! The train does not stay in the track or gets stuck going from one track piece to another. Very surprised Disney and Fisher Price would put their names on this piece of junk."
5,GET UP AND DANCE!!!,"This CD got me into ska. Sure enough it's not pure straight-ahead kind of ska that true ska fans are used to listening to, but this'll make you just wanna cruise around on a sunny day with this CD turned way up. I think it was the summer of '97 that I seriously played this CD every day just because it was so cool. And the thing is, I still play it today and it's just as cool! The horn section of this band is truly amazing along with the bass that kicks the whole band. I do wish two things though: that more ska bands these days were more like RBF, and that RBF put out more albums!"
3,"Good, but....","I rate this 3 stars cuz.....when I first listened to it, there was just way too much horns for me, after awhile all the songs started to sound the same. but.....it was worth the buy"
3,RBF is ok........,"When I hear people talking about how great of a ska CD this is, it makes me think that the only ska they've heard is No Doubt. This CD was what first turned me onto ska, and once I started to get into it, I saw that Reel Big Fish was really just an average band. This CD is alright, but for some REALLY great ska, check out the Mad Caddies, Mustard Plug, The Hippos, or the Aquabats. You won't be disappointed."
2,Catchy tunes which just suck after a while,"When I first bought this CD, almost two years ago, I thought it was absolutely the best CD ever made. After listening to it for a while, I realized that, no, it wasn't that good. In fact, I think Reel Big Fish are just a alternative band with some ska riffs and catchy pop songs. (Hence ""Sell Out"" and ""She Has a Girlfriend Now"") I really like their sarcasm and their horns always sound amazing, but it's just not ska. This CD will not withstand the greatest test: you won't like it years after buying it. If you want some good ska CDs, look into Skavoovie & the Epitones' ""Fat Footin'"" or older Pietasters, like ""OoLooLoo,"" both of which I still love. However, if you've heard good things about ""Turn the Radio Off,"" just have a friend dub it for you -- you'll see."
3,Good CD but they are typical Trendy ska band,"They are trying way to hard!!! They need to back off just a tad. They say they are "" trendy ska"" but right now some of it doesnt sound that great. After a while of their music you get bored!!! They are a great band with fantastic music, they just need to get stuff together"
5,Great way to start a ska collection.,"Reel BIg FIsh's Turn the Radio Off was the first real SKa CD I bought back in 96'. SInce then I've collected about 70 ska CD's. THis is still my favorites next to LTJ's Losing Streak. THere is some great song writing, great horns and great singing. THere is some of the best song writing I've ever heard on thisa CD even though none of it is really srious. Remember, the Beatles started out with the same type of songwriting and look where they ended up. If you're already a ska fan you either have this CD or have heard every song twice from a friend, but if you're not a ska fan this is the first ska album you should get, not to hardcore but still ska. (check out Less THan Jake too)"
5,"my first CD, and still my favorite.","This is the first CD I ever purchased and I still listen to it to this day. What a great CD, all the way through. Excellent! Go check it out, you'll be playing it for years to come!"
5,it's all about the sexy trumpet players,"Some ska stinks. This doesn't. Solid, and true to the genre."
5,great CD,"this is an awesome CD with really catchy songs that will be stuck in your head for days, but won't annoy you since they're great songs. I really recommend this CD, it's one of my favorites!"
5,Arrogant but Brilliant.,"This album maybe represent the pinnacle of the current ska movement.Weaving great thrashing guitar with savage horn blasts, this album manages to be well produded, hard-rocking, and obnoxious, all at the same time.Forget the lyrics, like too many rappers, every song is about the band, forming a band, or hating other bands. The only exceptions to this self-involved pettiness is the brutal insturmental ""2:41,"" and the charming ""She has a Girlfriend Now,"" a little dittie about a woman who dumped her man for a women. Listen closely towards the end, he offeres to sever his member to earn her affections and she responds ""Aw, that's so sweet.""This is a slick, fast-paced powerful album that pretty much defines this period of ska. Enjoy it without regret."
4,This CD Rocks,"This CD got passed down from generation to generation when my brother gave this CD to me and the first time I listened to it I loved it. I especially liked: Sell Out, Trendy, S.R., and Beer. Get this CD. Once again, it ROCKS!"
4,I find this cd to be entertaining and fun to dance to.,This cd has some outstanding fun songs on it although some of them are a little boring the better ones make up for it. I am pleased with it and it is in my cd player at this moment.
5,"I loved this CD, and would recommend it to ska listeners.","This CD rocks. It's fun and entertaining. The lyrics are a bit explicet, but it's not a big deal. The songs are original. The melodies are cool, and they have great voices. Every song is a hit and it's a story about their rise to radio fame and their love lives(in a nut shell). I've had this CD for over a year and still listen to it constantly."
5,Fun cd,"Really great, fun and even funny album. These guys really can make some great sounds out of a trumpet and trombone. It's also a perfect ska cd for a party."
1,hypocritcal ska-pop,"This cd is quite horrible. It's third wave, candy-coated, radio friendly ""ska"" that will bore and annoy you aftera cuople listens. What makes me despise this band so much is their hypocritical lyrics. THe whole album talks about how radio and MTV are for sellouts, yet these two mediums are probably the first places you've heard of them. Don't support this band, if you like third wave ska, give your cash to bands with some ethics and talent, such as Mustard Plug and the Aquabats."
1,Trendy ...,"This CD is just as trendy as anything else they play on mtv. If you wanna hear the same song over and over again, buy this CD. All the songs kind of sound the same after a few minutes....Pretty much, it sounds like the ... record labels were behind the production."
1,Reel Big Sellouts,"Sure when you listen to a couple of their songs, they have an okay sound, but all of their songs sound the same, even on other albums. And am I the only person who isn't completely dense? Can't you hear what they're singing about??? Sellout... well they have. Trendy... They want to be. All I want is more... and Join the club...!!! Come on!!! Hey everybody jump on the corporate bandwagon! Join the club! Listen to Reel Big Fish!!! Well all I can say is, if you LIKE listening to music that sounds like everything else and is completely hackneyed and unorigional...then this is the album for you!"
5,stop not enjoying them,"hi-ya! ok it appears to me that most people REALLY love this CD or they really don't: So for all of you peoples that are saying that RBF are not ""hard core ska"" you need to just stop because we are not 11 or 13 years old and we still enjoy this CD & RBF,so what if they are not ""hard core"" we don't care this is a great CD so enjoy"
2,Reel Big Fish at their Reel Big Best,"This CD is excellent if some 11-year old played it for you at his house last weekend, and it was your first time to hear ska. The problem is, nearly every song on this CD sounds the same as the one before it. They over use those stupid, moronic, cliched ska phrases (Pick it up, etc.) on nearly each song. Don't get me wrong, this CD is cool the first time you hear it. But by now, the only songs on this disc I can stand are ""She Has A Girlfriend Now"" and ""All I Want Is More."" If you are already a ska fan that doesn't have this disc, but is considering buying it, should not waste their money."
4,A Great CD,"What inspired me to buy this CD was the video for ""She Has a Girlfriend Now"" not only is the music video absolutely hilarious, the song is too. When I first got the album that was pretty much the only song I listened to, but then I started letting the CD play the whole way through and I ended up really liking it. Most of the songs on here are really great, fun to listen to, but you might wanna skip over one or two of them. Reel Big Fish is a great ska band, so you should go check 'em out."
5,Reel Big Fish Have made the best ska out there.,Reel Big Fish is the best ska band ever. Not only are the songs great but almost all the lyrics are based on their experiences unlike some bands. You have no taste in ska if you dont like The fish.
5,Long Live Ska!!!,"This was what happened... I got this CD for myself, but I decided to give it to my friend (I was trying to get him to like Punk/Ska). It took A LOT of me to give the CD up, and even after giving it up (and my friend really enjoyed this CD), I still decided to go and get another one, b/c this album is REALLY GOOD!This album is a must have!"
1,Uhm...,"I personally think RBF wants to be famous with some of it's lyrics, but to call them sellouts, means they would have to be famous, and since they are not, then, technically, they didn't sellout?"
1,Don't waste your money!,I hoped that this would be the easy answer to our roof dam issues....it was NOT!!!! This did not seem to be doing anything as far as melting the snow/ice...so I put one on in the snow on the ground and left it to see what would happen. What happened?? NOTHING. Please...save your money and put it towards a roof rake.Learn from my mistake.I hope this helps someone.
1,One star is a few stars too many,These things did not work at all. They have been on my roof for about two weeks. I chucked about 3/4 of the bucket onto a 10 foot stretch of my roof. I guess I will have to go on the roof to get them down when the girls (April and May) take care of the snow and ice dams. Name anything- it would have done a better job than these... Monkey smoking a cigarette? Yep. My cat. Yep. Don't waste your money. These things are worthless.
1,I would give this 0 stars if I could,"I bought a bucket of this from a local hardware store to see if it would help with the ice dam on my roof. I went up to my roof, emptied the entire bucket (about 2 feet from the edge of the roof, and each tablet was spaced about 1.5 ft apart) and they did almost nothing. I did this when we had a warm spell in the 20's and even low 30's and I expected the ice dam to at least break up a little. All the tablets did though was to sink down a little ways. They didn't melt any ice except for the ice that was directly beneath it. Don't waste your money on this junk."
3,roof tablets,The tablets were in poor shape.They were broken and the bottom of the bucket had 1.5 inches of powder that was from decomposed tablets.The tablets did help melt the ice as stated.I had to use the powder on the driveway.I was not happy with the price.
1,$216.65 to ship it????,"Would have loved to try this product, but shipping came to over $216! Where is it coming from - Mars????"
1,useless,i used this on my home and apartment buildings roofs and with both i got ice dams. This did nothing
1,Waste of money,"Not only was it deliver a week after promised is seems to have done nothing for the ice on my roof. Will never purchase this again, or from this distributer."
1,DON'T WORK,"This product was easy to throw up unto the roof, but it didn't do anything. Still had to climb up to roof to remove the ice in the valley."
1,Damaging,"I have ice dams and currently have a team of insulation installer guys mucking around in my attic. I showed them the ice melt I got for a part of the house not accessible from the attic (this stuff, calcium chloride based) and they told me to take it back. Calcium chloride is damaging to asphalt shingles. They suggested getting ice melt made of magnesium or potassium instead, which is what I'm doing."
2,broken tablets,"This product hasn't seemed to promote melt on the roof yet. Half of the bucket contained broken tablets, and there is ground particles that I am unable to throw up on the roof."
1,WHY are they ROUND???,"I live in the Adirondacks, and have an awful time with ice dams. I spend a lot of time on an icy roof, shoveling and hacking at ice. I thought these would be a great way to avoid that problem.It sounded great - just toss them up! So, I raked my roof, and started tossing tablets.THEY ROLLED RIGHT OFF THE ROOF. Then, they disappeared into the snowbank below.Are you kidding me? These things are not cheap. I ended up taking them up onto the roof to toss them from there -- again, about a third of them rolled right off. The only way to postition these effectively is to PLACE them right near the edge. Much more dangerous than tossing a cupful of salt crystals from a distance.Extremely frustrating. Plus, as others have said, they seem to just sit there and not melt anything. At least, if they were in a cube or some shape that wouldn't roll off - they might have a chance to work."
1,NOT a Good Start,"Frank Leanza's ""How to Get Started With the Clarinet"" is, in fact, precisely NOT what the title suggests. No fingering chart(!), shabby, garage-publishing-style photographs, few exercises, fewer instances of worthwhile advice for the beginner, and still FEWER points of interest for anyone who isn't quite literally just getting started with the clarinet.Not a good choice.I recommend instead Bruce Pearson's Comprehensive Band Method series, ""Best in Class."""
2,Not Like New,"I ordered a paperback copy of this book which was supposed to be ""like new"". The book I received was a hardcover copy not to mention that the book was pulling away from its binding."
1,A complete waste of time!,The author talks in circles and never says much that is useful. Most of the material that IS useful is stolen from other writers. You are better off reading one of the standard conducting texts. This book is a waste of your time.
1,Making a Victrola Sound Good...,"...This is one of the worst recordings I have ever heard. Fading back and forth between stereo and mono, overwhelming static and echo...this is just nasty.I love Toots, and there are only a couple of cuts here that you can't find on the fabulous ""The Very Best of Toots,"" which I heartily recommend as an alternative.This CD is a shame, as there are a couple of cuts I have never seen on other Toots offerings, but the quality is just so poor that there is little opportunity to enjoy any new discoveries.Stay Away!"
4,France today,"I heard Non Merci on the car radio in France this summer. While I didn't even hear the whole thing, I knew I had to seek it out, and hoped they would mention the name of the singer. Fortunately, they did, and I bought the CD tout de suite. Non Merci remains the catchiest track, but the others get better and better with listening, especially Riviere de Mon Enfance. Only objection is that it's a tiny tad overproduced in spots. Otherwise, a good example of current french pop."
4,Sardou is back !,"After the bad album ""Franais"", Sardou is back with a brand new album. A new team, younger and with beautiful songs. ""La rivière de notre enfance"" is the best of them.""Loin"" remains in the style of Sardou but it's the only song.The others are most rhythmed. In 2004, Sardou's considered like the favorite singer for the French.""Du plaisir"" is a pleasure to listen."
3,Not so exciting,I have really liked the messages that Michel Sardou provides in his music and the variety of music genre as well. This CD seemed mostly uninteresting (although there are few good songs on it). Guess I just like the old stuff.
5,Beautiful,I received in a very timely manner just before Christmas. It is beautiful. It is lightweight so it doesn't pull down the tree limb. It is 3D. We plan to leave it in the living room instead of putting away for the whole year and are thinking of ordering another one for family member.
5,Quality Ornament,The item was even more beautiful than I thought it would be. Very solid construction...it looks very expensive and I was so proud to give it to my fiance for Christmas. Great keepsake for those of you that want a quality piece.
2,"Cool cover on the paperback, but.....","The novel focuses on a pshychiatrist who seems to have as many mental problems as the people she is supposedly treating. In fact, every character in the book seems to have serious mental problems. There is some sex in the book, but most of it isn't likely to excite the reader. There is a lot of gore if you like gore. There is a vampire who rarely appears as a vampire. After 300 pages of buildup, the final confrontation between good and evil takes about two pages--not the most satisfying conclusion to a vampire book."
1,I'm nauseous,"When I read a vampire novel, I want to care a small amount about the plot and characters. This novel did nothing but disgust me. From necrophilia to massive amounts of gore, this novel moves as far away from the gothic wonders of ""Dracula"" as you can get."
5,Sleepless In Kent Island Maryland,"I'd be surprised if Mr. Norman's book does not keep you awake at night. I know it had that affect on me. Even if you think you like Wal-Mart, after you read this book I doubt you will ever look at a superstore the same way again. The book also provides a common sense, easy to follow game plan for citizens to fight superstore sprawl. I know it will help us in our fight against the invasion of Wal-Mart on Kent Island."
4,A Good Effort,"""Touchdown Jesus"" is not R. Laurence Moore's finest work. His writing is at times underwhelming - occaisonally hitting at a level lower than he is usually capable of writing - and the lack of citation makes it difficult for inclusion in a bibliography. However, his analysis is sound and, as an introduction to American religious history, the book is quite good. For those with a good deal of background in the subject, his analysis will be interesting but not necessarily groundbreaking. For those with little knowledge of American religion, this text can be a good introductory experience. I also recoomend Richard Fox's ""Jesus in America."""
2,disappointed,"I was highly disappointed by the lackluster color of these opals. They look more like white moonstones! They are a nice size, but they have very little ""sparkle."""
2,"It's too small. ""Giant"" is a bad description.","While this toy is all right, it's freaking tiny. It fits in the palm of your hand and just overflows a bit. Not hardly the ""giant"" toy I was expecting. Really, really small."
4,The real mystery is...,"What is the deal with this game? It's a mystery to me, but this game is one of my favorites on the NEOGEO. This game is incredibly basic and simple...just a slot machine and bonus card game...but yet I keep coming back for more. I can't get enough of this game. Maybe it is the ever-elusive MYSTERY BONUS that the title teases you with...I just know that some super spectacular thing is going to happen when I line up those three rainbow-proud question marks up in a row...yet, this gratification continues to elude even me..the hopelessly addicted gamer. SOMEDAY I will find the answer to these triple question marks that taunt and tease me. In the meantime, the real mystery remains..."
1,I bought a 700MHZ G3 and hated it,"My iBook was 100 MHZ faster and I could barely run anything on it. I started hitting the bargian bin for older games just so they would run. New games, even slightly old games, just won't cut it. And the CAD software for my engineering classes? Forget it! So it mine won't cut it, this thing is worse. Don't bite man, this one's a dud."
1,More than 1 review that says it cuts the children is enough for me!,"I was just about to purchase this since it said it was award winning, when I decided to check the reviews! Thank God I did! More than one review that says it cuts the childrens heels is enough for me!!! To the lady who says the mothers of these children are crazy???? Maybe if it happened to your child you'd feel differently! Have some compassion! Maybe your child doesn't ride it as forcefully as the others! Any area sharp enough to slice through skin should be a major concern on any toy!"
4,My twins loved these,"My twin girls loved these bikes. They recieved them when they were 12-months old and I'm only getting rid of them now that they are almost three due to space issues (and they have real trikes now).We never put batteries in them, and the girls never missed them. We didn't have any problems with them tipping or breaking. But I do agree that even with the seat on the lowest setting, it's a bit big for the average 12-month old. 18 months is a better starting age."
1,Very disappointed,"I wish I had read the reviews before spending the money. The back tire is too big and my 20 mos. old gets her foot caught on it. Basically, the only good thing about this trike is the things inside that move. My daugher sits on it just to watch that but doesn't ride. Don't waste your money...would not recommend."
1,Not durable toy,"My daughter received this ride-on for her 1st birthday. A year later, it's lost both of its handle bars and the whirly function doesn't work (even with new batteries). It was a difficult ride-on to manuever. The Little Tykes ""Push and Ride Racer"" is a much better alternative. It has lasted through all three of my kids hardest play. It's lots of fun and easy to ride too."
1,Broke almost immediately,"My 1.5 year old only had this toy for one week when the handle broke off completely. It was sharp where it broke off, and we would consider that dangerous to a 1.5 year old. Very disappointing."
4,Loves it,"We recieved this toy as a gift and my son has not been off of it yet! He is a tall guy according to the drs and he has no problem with this toy. As far a having a hairpin turning radius, well I really don't want my 20th month old to have that kind of abilty! He uses it in the house on the stone and carpet and does well. Wheels roll fine. I am pleased with this toy."
2,handle bars break off,My little boy loved this until the handle bars broke off. It is not strong enough to support the weight when child id getting on and off.
1,Bad placement of back tire,"We got this for my daughter when she was 18 months. When she tries to push herself forward, her heels hit the back wheel, and she can't go anywhere. It might as well not have wheels."
1,waste of money!,my son recieved this as a christimas gift. It was broken within a week and he was only 14 months old. I thought it looked really fun and he did enjoy it for the short time he was able to play with it. do not waste your money it is not worth all the tears that come with it .
2,"Not as bad as some say, but...","My son got this for his 1st birthday and enjoyed it for a while. He would sit on it, but it doesn't roll well. He mostly pushed it around like a walker or stood on it. The complaint people have about the confetti stopping and having to shake the toy is funny though. It sapposed to stop if the bike doesn't move to save batteries. When it goes again, the confetti starts up. I just wish he had gotten something more entertaining."
2,Not that interesting......,"My daughter just turned one, and she got a lot of gifts for her birthday. This one is by far her least favorite. I doubt I will experience the ""breaking handle"" situation that other reviewers talk about as my daughter won't stay on the rider for more than a few seconds before she completely loses interest. I think we're going to give it away. We're counting it as a loss and will probably purchase something else."
3,Not very comfortable,"The seat is not the most comfortable one. My daughter likes pushing it around but does not like to ride on it for long. I would not recommend this bike. The ""Little Tikes Push & Ride Racer"" is much better."
3,Not for rough children!,My daughter is 19 months now and it was good while it lasted. She had fun on it (more from standing on it and flipping it over than actually riding it) until this past week. She completely got the front wheel OFF. It's a fun toy and is great at teaching her the beginnings of bike riding but I think she has more fun taking it apart and playing Evil Knievel than actually riding it!
1,Stay clear of this toy,"I have two daughters and they each bought this toy for their children. They both loved it. My one year old granddaughter had this trike for 3 months before both handles broke off leaving sharp edges. My one year old grandson had the toy for 1 month before one of the handles broke of leaving sharp edges. These children were only trying to ride the trike and were not hard it. I have tried to contact the Little Tike Company about this and have received no response. We threw the toys away and consider them a loss since Little Tikes apparently is not going to do anything to rectify the problem. I have bought many Little Tikes toys for my grandchildren, but I am very disappointed in this one and even more disappointed that the company refuses to acknowledge the problem. Leave this toy on the shelf; it is not only inferior in quality it is also dangerous because of the sharp edges the broken handles leave."
1,Horrible ride on and not worth the money,"The bike was okay for about an hour...the twirly thing was messing up and the pieces were already sticking. The bike does not roll across the floor well, and it doesn't turn well. Save your money, DO NOT BUY THIS."
4,AWESOME TOY!,"My 20 month old daughter received this as a Christmas gift this past Christmas (December 2005). She has thoroughly loved riding around the house on this toy and espeically loves watching the glitter and shapes spin around when the toy is moving. We have even had it outside on our driveway and sidewalk which is sloped and haven't had a problem with it trying to turn over with her. I too have no idea how either of these other children have sliced their feet open as the plastic on this toy is rounded at the edges. I would recommend this toy to any child in the correct age group, and I'm a protective mother... :)"
3,You people are crazy!,"I just examined the Go and Grow my son has used since he was 1 year old. I can't even imagine how a kid would CUT themselves on it! I think any child will run their own foot over as they learn to ride on something. My son has a short attention span for this toy, but that's really my only complaint. I think it's safe and smart."
2,Go a different route,"For my daughter first birthday, I debated purchasing Little Tikes ride-on or one from Radio Flyer. I chose LT because I like the idea that you can adjust the height and it looked sturdy. It was the wrong decision. My daughter is above average in height and while on it her feet did not reach the ground. Now at 19 months, she still barely able to reach the ground. It is also very difficult to manuever. The wheels do not glide well outdoors and the steering is limited and clumsy. All in all, I'm not happy with my purchase and plan to purchase the little trike from Radio Flyer."
2,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS,"We have had the bike for about 5 months and my 18 month old daughter was just able to ride the thing even at the lowest setting because it was too tall for her. Finally when she CAN ride it one of the handle bars popped off and we had to throw it away due to the danger of her flipping over. I could not believe the handle popped off when it is a Little Tikes toy, I thought they were durable!!!!! So disappointed!!"
2,A little unsafe.,"My daughter was on her Go and Grow Rider when the two front wheels locked up and she went face first on to the ground. I do not know why the wheels locked up, but my little girl has not been on it since."
3,LOVE THE TOY - EXCEPT THE HANDLE BARS!!!,"My son (who is now 2 1/2) got this toy when he was about 15months. He's LOVED this tricycle ever since. His feet have never gotten cut - infact, he finds it MUCH easier to ""drive"" without getting his feet caught up in 2 rear wheels. We've kept it in the house because he loves it so much.My gripe: we've had 2 so far - and now need another. The handle bars are held together with a flimsy, hard plastic which breaks after numerous ""wheelies"" and such.After having the ""Go and Grow"" he doesn't like traditional tricycles - so we'll have to get another.... $75.00 in a year and a half on a plastic tricycle..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY,"MY SON RECEIVED THIS GIFT FOR XMAS AND WHEN HE TRIED TO GET OFF OF IT, THE BIKE SHAVED THE SKIN OF HIS RIGHT HEEL. HE HAD A DEEP CUT THAT TOOK 3 WKS TO HEAL AND HE NOW HAS A SCAR. I WILL STICK WITH FISHER-PRICE."
2,The handle broke,"My 12 month old son got this toy as a gift,one day he was sitting on it and I heard a snap, he somehow snapped off one side of the handle bar's. I could not believe my young son could be capable of that."
5,The Art of Colors,"I purchased this book for my sister, who is an art teacher for elementary students. She was very pleased with this book and will use it as a reference for her art classes."
3,Not a bad option.,Despite the naysayers snakebite kits of this type have been around for years and saved hundreds of lives (including my own). Are there better options? Certainly.Sawyer Extractor Pump KitBut it is better than nothing by far. There seems to be a consensus amongst the naysayers that a hospital and anti-venom are a phone call away. We were two days walk from the closest road on a hiking/hunting trip when mine had to be used in an area with no cellphone service (not that any of us had a cellphone in the '80s)The product will give you a chance to save your life. Period.
1,Item was not in stock so they sent completely different part,"This was a total waste....they didn't have what was shown or ordered, so they sent a completely different part (bigger size etc) Then it was up to me to pay for return for refund. I did not return, because if a business can do this on the front end, I would NEVER trust them to do the correct thing on the Return end.DO NOT EVER BUY FROM THEM....."
2,Change The Picture!!!!!,"Amazon needs to update their photo file on this product!!!! It is misleading to put a picture of a dispenser & hand cleaner combo, then only send out the dispenser!!!! As far as the product goes, the dispenser is 4 star quality, but Amazon missed the boat on this one!!!! Change your damn picture!!!!!"
1,A bad recommendation,"I checked this book out on a recommendation from an acquaintance who I will never listen to again. This is adolescent stuff. Not only that, but it is stolen stuff. People are raving about the reavers--hello! That concept [and name] originated with Stephen R. Donaldson. This sociopathic stuff that constitutes fantasy these days is very disturbing."
2,Become a better tale teller,This is my recommendation for the author. This story is so full of holes and what is there is so woefully underdeveloped I don't understand how this book can be praised as a major literary accomplishment. The novel is full of your typical fantasy novel junk.
5,Full of character and action,"I'm a recent convert to David Farland's Runelord series, and I'm thrilled to have found this author and this series. His plot and plot twists keep me on my toes, the action is riveting and I love the good guys and I love to hate the bad guys. The idea of endowments is metaphoric of so many things that, even though it plays heavily in the plot, every time it appears it means something new to me. And Mr. Farland is not afraid of taking risks with his characters. This is fantasy at its best."
4,Pulled in even deeper!,"In looking for a good book, I found a great adventure! The Sum of All Men pulled me in, in ways that I had not been able to find since Anne Rice and her first vampires. Botherhood of the Wolf, met all of my expectations and made me realize ones I hadn't thought of. This series sets you up to open to something that is not quite understood but welcome just the same. Was only disappointed in the failure of the Earth King to realize the importence of following his guides, but then would we have more to look forward to if he had. As in all books, series especially, there will disappointments, slow moments, confusion or suprises, but those cab only serve to make it more real and enjoyable."
4,Second book better than the first,"I have read most of the reviews of the first book and they all seem disappointed. Farland does a good job with innovating new ideas, but doesn't execute well. Comments are made about the characters being flat, and the world under developed.The Second book works towards fixing a lot of the issues that made the first book OK, but not great. While I would still rank Farland below the talent of George Martin, Robert Jordan, etc... he has improved his concept in Brotherhood of the wolf enough to merit a positive review.His characters seem more defined, and more real. The most improved being the knight the young prince sends out into the world on an impossible mission. The world is more richly detailed, although there is still room to improve here.The good news is that what Farland did right in the first book he does again in this one. If you managed to make it through the first book, I would recommend reading the second."
4,Exciting yet redundant,"Brotherhood, as I stated, was exciting and yet redundant. If I had to see the definition of ""vector"" one more time . . .also, the reiteration of Borenson's quest over and over grated. In agreement with other reviews, Farland tended to introduce plot twists that he did nothing with, such as the world worm and the Inkarran mage. A little more focus on the other two powers (Air and Water) would also be nice. Of course, both of these may be in a sequel, so I could be psychic. The book is a great read though, especially the battle with the Glory and the fight for the Seal. All in all, a good read with a few (minor) flaws."
4,A good read but not a great one.,"I think this runelord series is the prefect saga to read while waiting for Wheel of Time, Sword of Truth, and A song of Ice and Fire. I don't think it stands up to those, but it is probabally one of the more consistant fantasy I have read in a while, this sequel is just as good as the 1st, if not better, useally authors loose a little something with the sequel, but Farland keeps a consistant pace with his writing, and story line."
4,Runelords : Book 2,The ideas are fantastic. The plot is superb. I would give this 5 stars if the writing were improved. Some parts of the book tend to drag as the author seems to like long-winded explanations.
1,As bad as the worst role-playing game scenarios,"It really does read like some ill-conceived fantasy role-playing game. Statistical approaches to abilities, freakish monsters and heroes. Dull, dull stuff.Reviewers seem to be in awe of the ""originality"" of the magic system. Geez, easily impressed, aren't we? An original magic system is neat for those weekend dungeons and dragons campaigns between junior high students but doesn't impres me in a novel. Try writing with depth and skill, now there's something you don't see on the fantasy shelves these days.I'd rather eat broken glass than read this slop."
3,"In a word, ""Meh.""","The fantastical elements of the Runelords universe is, in my opinion, marvelous. I love the concept of endowments, and of the nature of elemental magic in Farland's series. As for everything else, though...it just doesn't toot my horn.I find Gaborn and Iome, the two main protagonists to be sickening in their virtue and honor. I can't find myself relating to either of them. These musty old stock-characters just don't think or feel like any real human being would. The other characters, though, are of fairly respectable craftsmanship.The build-up in this book takes too long, and the climax was lacking. ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" is on par with ""Runelords,"" but both get their butts kicked by ""Wizardborn,"" the third book in the series. I would recommend wading through this mediocre book, if only so you'll understand what's happening in the third book in the series."
1,Creepy stuff,"I had no idea when I first was given this book that David Farland was a false name for Dave Wolverton, who wrote and co-wrote so much of L. Ron Hubbard's strange stuff. I read the sum of all men and it creeped me out, but I assumed that was intentional and let it go. But once I got into this one, I began to see a frightening pattern.The writing in this book is very repetitive and amateurish. The concepts do not make make sense, unless you put them in the context of Wolverton's real world. This is an unimpressive and poorly written series, but it certainly does contribute some dangerous ideas and attitudes."
1,Come on! This series REEKS!,"With so many other fine and semi-fine epic fantasy series out there, this is a pale also-ran, a cheap imitation of Eddings, Donaldson, Jordan and even Goodkind with a sick mentality behind it. The writing is trite and one dimensional, the characters [especially the women] are dull and stereotypical. The dialog is wooden, and a lot of things are stolen directly from other fantasy worlds [like the reavers].Save your money on this one."
2,Slow knockoff,"This book could have been done in half to a third of the pages he took. Ethical questions notwithstanding, it's also a very derivative book. The reavers are right out of Thomas Covenant, as is, if I recall, the concept of draining, and some features of the evil characters.If you actually liked this, go back in time a couple decades and read Donaldson instead. The characters are better."
4,"Good, not Great but held my interest.","I really enjoyed the first book, Runelords: Sum of All Men, and I couldn't wait to read this book. I confess i struggled through some of the book, but about 250 pages from the end this book picks up tons of steam, the Reavers come out of the ground and all heck breaks loose. I thought the whole battle between the Reavers and Castle Carris was awesome, and the fight scenes reminded my a lot of Salvatore and his Forgotten Realms books. You won't be disappointed with this second book in the series. I'll definitely read Wizardborn (I've already bought it and it's sitting on my nightstand), but I'm going to read a couple other things first and then revisit the world of the Runelords and the Earth King."
1,Banal,"I am totally lost in the quest for a point in this series, and it appears I am not alone; the author joins me on the endless search for the theme here. True, he has invented a magic system different from other series, but it is implausible and offensive. The characters are one dimensional and unsympathetic, the writing flat and the interactions between men and women dull or worse. It is hard for me to imagine that a writer as fine as Orson Scott Card would do anything more than spit in the direction of this book, and yet a lot of the second-rank SFF authors have lined up to praise it. I can't believe they even read it."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Earth King, baby.At least temporarily, anyway. With rumours of his new status growing, Gaborn finds it a little easier to gather forces to him.An old retainer of the King has awakened after his death, and ends up finding a strange, mystical superwoman.Raj Ahten, the super-superman is still around, of course, and even worse, a monster army that really would like to get rid of all the humans is on the way.3 out of 5"
1,Disappointing,"The first book in this series wasn't marvelous, but was pretty good, and interesting. I hoped that this second book would improve on the subject matter.Boy, was I disappointed.This whole book seemed very vague, with the main hero dissolving into confusion, and dragging his readers with him. The other characters are poorly portrayed, and the whole book leads to a massive battle scene at the end - which fizzles out with almost no punch. The conclusion of the book seems to be more because the author ran out of intelligent things to say than because the story was finished."
2,"Not totally hideous, but not really even good","David Farland's writing style drives me crazy. The characters are cartoonish clowns, and the plot is wooden, but there is a hint of interesting stuff below the surface, if he could just unearth it from beneath all the garbage. I gave the second book a try, hoping he had gotten better at it, but was wrong. I borrowed this book, and I was glad to give it back. I will not make the same mistake again, and will read nothing more by this author [in any incarnation.]"
3,Maintains the flavor of the first,"If you enjoyed the first book in the series, I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one, too. On the flip side, if you disliked the first book, you probably won't like this one. For me, this book continued the same tone and pacing as the first. The first 3/4 is subplots and characters coming together for a massive multi-chapter battle/climax in the last 1/4. Yes, some ideas and plot points, like the Days, are pushed to the back, but other characters and subplots are brought in to fill the gaps.I don't understand the other reviews on Amazon that say it is either much worse than the first or much better. It seemed much the same. Don't get me wrong - it doesn't stagnate, it just keeps a similar feel.Again, if you liked the first, I recommend that you continue reading."
1,ITS CHINESE!!!!,"WHEN I GOT THE HARD DRIVE I PUT IT IN MY 360, AND IT DOES NOT SAY 20GB! WELL IT MAY, I JUST CANT TELL BECAUSE THE HARD DRIVE SHOWS UP IN CHINESE CHARACTERS! OH YEAH ALSO, WHEN I PUT THE HARD DRIVE IN IT SAID THAT IT HAS 13GB OF FREE MEMORY WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE 20GB. AND I WENT THROUGH IT AND DELETED ALL THE ADD ONS AND DIFFERENT SAVED GAMES AND IT STILL ONLY CAME OUT TO HAVING 13GB OF FREE MEMORY. IDK IT WORKED SO IT WAS OK I GUESS, BUT I WISH I GOT SOMETHING BETTER FOR JUST A LIL MORE MONEY!"
5,HARD DRIVE XBOXINUINBIGAC,Great Product for the price. I need another one. I will go to Amazon for the BEST DEAL IN USA ALL AROUND!! HOW DOES THAT SOUND!!!
4,hard drive,i don't know why the xbox would be sold without one. greatly improves use of the games. only way to save profiles
4,X360 20G Hard Drive,The package arrived in good condition and within a week.My son was happy with the hard drive considering I was not going to pay for a brand new one. The one he received did the job.I would use this seller again.
3,Fine,"It's not big in terms of space, it's over priced and with the new xbox OS coming out, it's even smaller. And it's 20 gigs, but after everything is set up you only have about 12 gigs of space. With the nex XBX360 OS you'll be able to install games onto your HDD, and this wont cut it for that really.Because Xbox live lets you download demos, install updates/patches, download full Xbox 1 games and will eventually let you install games with the new update this thing will be more annoying than anything.It's good for casual gamers not planning on installing anything big, but I'm already down to 2 gigs and I have 6 xbox live games installed and no movies/demos."
3,Price to size ratio sucks,"The title says it. I got a 120gb HDD for $50, it's just not worth it to buy a HDD with this small of a size at that price. It works, it's an upgrade, but if you're buying an HDD, I strongly suggest the 60gb or the 120gb, as microsoft reserves about 7gigs per harddrive (my 20gb went to 13, and my 120gb had 113gb)"
3,some advice,Now i rather have a hard drive..but flash drives also work with saving games..i got a 8 GB flash drive.. and configuring it to xbox takes up to about 2 GB or so.. and after all that .. plus have 3 games and DLC on the flash drive.. i still have about 5.4 Gigs left..i recently put lollipop chainsaw ( dont judge ) and borderlands 2.. and the space availble did BEARLY change..so getting a 16 gig.. or 8gig.. is a cheap exception .. some advice from a fellow game lover :D
4,Xbox 360 hard drive,"This site is asking me how much fun the game is. It's a hard drive, not a game, so there really is no level of ""fun"" to be described. The hard drive helped my son to have a more fullfilling game experience."
4,Doesn't work with 4GB Slim,This is a true Microsoft product but does not work with the 4GB Slim as shipped. I wanted an HD to run original xbox games on my 4GB 360 slim. I managed to remove the actual hard drive from its casing and plug it into the internal port where it is actually working but this is probably not something the typical user will want to do. Still for less than $15 versus buying a large size internal for hundreds it's a great deal and I got it to work on my 4GB slim.
4,its pretty good,I can play original xbox games which is pretty awsome and i have more space to save my games and last but not least i can have music without a flashdrive
2,20GB = 13.6GB for this Drive,"I ended up with this size drive because it came with the unit. I not naive and I assumed that 20GB would not actually translate into 21,474,836,480 usable bytes. But, of the ""20GB"" size, only 13.6GB are usable. That's formatted folks; totally empty. This size drive is a total rip-off. Save your money and get the 60GB or even the 120GB. The only reason it gets 2 stars (and not 1) is because it actually works as a HDD."
1,Nothing but junk,This is a huge waste of money. 20GB for 89.99 and there upgrade to 120GB to 179.99 is completly outrageous!!!
1,A huge rip off by Microsoft again,"For the same price, you can get a harddrive of 750 GB for PC. It proves just how crazy the Microsoft is to rip customers off. No wonder so many people don't like this company and their product.I got my xbox 360 console as a gift, and I have already spent 200 bucks to get together the controllers and harddrive(to play xbox games such as ninja gaiden, you must have the harddrive, oh, man, who would know for xbox it request additional parts to be backwards compatible?)Don't buy it."
2,would be good but....,"I kinda got the wrong product so i would say its good but i cant try it sooooo yeahhh, need a slim hard driver"
1,Half of what you paid for,As with other complaints; this HD has only slightly more than half of the available space advertised.The cost of the actual storage is more than it should be.beware seller misleading buyer
3,XboxHDD,"Great hard drive, easy to install, clicks onto the top of the console, was online in minutes! Fast shipping too!"
4,not too bad..,the xbox 360 20gb hard drive isnt the best but is really cheap..if you go out and buy a 20 gb hard drive for your 360 (out of the box) it gives your 20gb but for some reason when you buy a used one you only get 13gb if you want a hard drive just to play games which you need a hard drive like halo and want to play demons and download map packs you would want the hard drivebut if you want to get even more memory dont get this hard drive used..buy it new..overall this hard drive is cheap (used or new) and isnt that bad for a basic gamer..if your a serious gamer this hard drive isnt for your..
5,hard drive,i brought this product for my son and he absolutely loves it. it allows him to play all of his xbox games and save all he needs along with music and videos i send him while im out on deployment. its an excellent working product and i look forward to ordering from amazon and great georgia games in the future for all his gaming needs.
3,Product does its job but nothing special,"I bought this product knowing it was used and I wouldn't get 20gb worth of free space. BUT when I cleared all the memory I could I only ended up with 13gb, I think that's a little low. Aside from that the product works and stores memory that's what I needed."
5,"Works great, lots of space","I am very pleased with this purchase. It was easy to snap on, and it's been really, really nice not having to worry about using up too much space or buying new memory cards. I save and download as I please, and it's working out nicely."
3,Wasn't what I expected,"I ordered this product because I needed more memory for my Xbox, which came without a harddrive. This said it was 20gigs and although I know some products go off a little (such as a 10gigs product actually having only 9.1gigs), but this was waaaay off. It came with 14gigs available. I paid for 20gigs, got 14. Good product overall, but please be aware of this."
5,Highly Recommended!,Its 13gb and not 20gb but still a great product to save and store all of your games. It even plays old xbox games.
1,Buyer beware!,"not only was this not the right product for my son's xbox360, it wasn't a hard for any xbox360- didn't work at all, totally disappointed kid- buyer should have stated was not for a slim model. I'll know better than to buy from this person ever again!!!!"
4,You need this,You need this if u have a core 360 it comes with installed stufflike games and behind the scenes of 360 some i think was not neccesary to include so you could delete stuff u dont want in ur harddrive.
3,Looks goofy,The HDD should be replacable and internal. Having it on top of the system looks goofy. Only 13 GB of space after formatting means nearly half the HDD is gone. Would appriciate it if Microsoft's next console used standard HDD.
3,Not Relevant,They are asking me khow this game is. I did not get a game. The hard drive works fine at storing data.
4,Buy it here,this storage device is worth getting even though its more around 13 than 20 and its cheaper here on amazon then target or best buy. if you have a lot of games for your 360 then you should get this instead of a memory card.
5,Wow !,U cant live without this drive. Life is a game and without memory u will not be able to save ur game or ur life. In fact im amazed at how much better life has been since i tried to purchased this drive for xbox 360. Love this product and would recommend u by at least 10 for ur xbox 360. ;\
3,It could be better,Its ok having the hd but it would be nice if it did have 20gb. It has about 13gbs free and the rest held up for system things. And for the price it would be nice to get the whole 20gbs.
3,Its good but...,"This is more or less a requirement for Xbox 360 but... it should not be so expensive given the disk space. It would have been better if they allowed USB hdd to saves instead of their ""own"" hdd. But it lets you have backward compatibility and download updates and demos.Not worth the cost but is a needed item. There has been rumors of a new hard drive, you should wait for that if you already have a memory card which is also a rip off (but thats the same for every system.)"
3,Needed.. but overexpensive and not a lot of space,"This is pretty much 'required' for an Xbox 360, no doubt. If you don't have it, you miss out on Xbox Live Demo's, Arcade games, custom music, etc. etc. The hard drive adds to the experience.But why is it so expensive? PS2's 40 GB hard drive costs $99 and comes included with a game. I can understand a 20 GB included with a Premium System, but why not instead offer a larger hard drive for $99? Most notebook hard drives (what the Xbox 360 uses) is $50 for 40 GB... RIP-OFF!And why hasn't MS announced a bigger hard drive? My 20 gigs went from 13 gigs (what is actually included, so its a bit deceiving) to 25 MB in a months time... no exaggeration. Why focus on a stupid HD DVD player when you can bring out an 80 gig HD or something?"
3,Misleading Storage Capacity,"PROS:- Owning a HDD allows you to download patches from Xbox Live to play original xboox games.- Download game demos from Xbox Live Marketplace- More storage than a memory cardCONS- 20 GB* is actually 13GB. For some reason, MS has 7 GBs reserved on the HDD.- 13 GB isnt very much when you consider game demos average about .5 GB to 1GB in size. If you're going to be downloading patches and add-ons for your games, as well as demos, that 13GB of storage is going to fill up sooner than you think."
3,way too expensive,"This thing works fine, is small, convenient, detachable. There are 3 problems I have:1) too little memory and the 360 OS/dashboard takes up a ton of space.2) overpriced for the amount of storage you get. you can find a 250GB+ external USB hard drive for this price or less. the price simply doesn't make sense.3) I would have appreciated a USB port (as on an external USB hard drive) so I could hook it up to my PC to transfer files."
3,it is a hdd,"It is a HDD and works as expected.It is quite a bit more expensive than a hard drive off the shelf, and you cannot just buy one. Microsoft uses a proprietary firmware in the HDD for xbox which locks you into thier product. Otherwise it is a drive just like off the shelf inside the case..."
2,WAY OVERPRICED!!,The pricing is absolutely ridiculous as a stand alone item. You can get quality hard drives with over 100 GB of memory for the same price. There isn't much you can do about it though since you'll need a hard drive to take advantage of the system's full functionalities and Microsoft knows this. They are using the margins they make off these hard drives to offset their costs incurred elsewhere.
2,Not a genuine microsoft product,The hard drive i recieved is not a genuine microsoft hard drive it was supposed to be a used product not refurbished it has a repair sticker on it and when connected to my xbox the writting is in chinese. I would not have purchased the product knowing this. On the plus side it seems to work otherwise and the delivery was a day ahead of schedule
4,great buy,great buy for the price holds all the games you would possibly need and works easily. connector part a little loose but makes no difference. Great buy and it shipped really quickly (2 days)
2,Dust collector,"This game was great,for about 30 minutes. After that it loses its appeal quickly.You will get very board with it after about 30 minutes. Its replay value is very low,rent this first. This is just my personal opinion."
1,Oh my god could they make a worse game,"I got it for my birthday from my mom this year and I hateit. The game is horrible. DO NOTBUY, WARNING: DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 5! END"
4,Good for the price,"These fit very well, especially over my big ears. I bought them for welding school to wear in the grinding room. Its a 10 X 10 block room, and gets pretty noisy. Even while wearing safety glasses it knocks the sounds down quite a bit. It is a little hard, so it wont form around the safety glasses, but it does it good enough for me not to complain. Overall for the price, you cant go wrong. They feel good and work great."
2,This is kind of stupid.,"I bought this CD with a gift certificate I had. If you have to purchase it with your own funds, I suggest you don't. This biography is unauthorized, so the band doesn't have anything to do with it. All it is, basically, is some British woman talking about the band for an hour. There are occasional sound bites of things that the actual band members said, but these don't last long. I've listened to this CD once. If you really want to know more about the band, go ahead and get it. But it is kind of boring if that's not what you're looking for. There is no music of there's on here or anything. If you want some good stuff, buy System's actual CDs, now those are great. But this is not a System of a Down CD, they had nothing to do with its production."
2,Booo....Hissss......,"I suppose that if you just absolutely have to have EVERYTHING about System of a Down, then you should pick up this CD. BUT, I was quite disappointed when I took a listen to it. Especially after paying full price. It consists of a British woman simply reading a shoddy biography of the band. I was hoping to hear of individual biographies of each member. Or maybe to hear the band members themselves talk about their experiences - but instead we get 5 second snipets of the band talking over the phone to an interviewer. Not recommended at all."
1,wtf,this is a bit rubbish i was expecting new system cd that would be a counterpart to steal turns out i had stupiditly brought a documentry with no interviews and no insite into the writeing process rubbish
1,Read before buying...,"Make sure you take a look at other people's items before purchasing this one. Is it worth listening to? Perhaps. Is it worth paying more than, say, $5 for it? Absolutely not."
4,For little to be best,This is very good album from System of a down.And I thing this is best album from this band.And I now That System of a down inthe future will make one album with 5 STAR'S. PS:all best from Flamur
2,blue topaz pear shape earrings,"The earrings are merely acceptable in color. Descriptive terms ""dazzling, vivid ice blue with fire"" are an exaggeration. I would describe the gemstones as a faded denim color. The stones were small and slightly unmatched in size but that really wasn't as important as the color to me. The 14 carat leverbacks are very nice. I would not recommend the earrings unless someone was looking for light colored stones. The price however is very reasonable."
3,Last squeeze of the Polka King,"Only about a half hour of content, the last four and a half minutes of repetitive maudlin slop. A few very good cuts of Frank's hits reprised with a potpourri of celebs. Who is Cowboy Jack Clement, anyway?"
2,not so great,It does say in the item description that this is a paper back book. what it should say it is a 16 page booklet. very disappointed. I cant believe some people are selling this for 12.99 what a rip. it is worth no more than a buck.
2,Only one side plays,"As other have said only Them! plays and not Beast from 20,000 fathoms. I've tried it in different dvd players and each one gives the same result. Only one move will play and not the other. Its all most like Beast from 20,000 fathoms is not even on there. Returning for another one does no good as the next one did the same thing and the same for the one after that."
4,"SciFi at its Greatest--""In The Beginning""","The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms / Them! (Double Feature)Two very good classics on the same DVD!,the quality of these DVDs was Excellent, the price was outstanding,the shipping was as advertised(arrived in short order & in Excellent shape!),both had excellent trailers and one had incert about the greats, Harryhausen&Bradbury;(both visionarys) and are an excellent addition to any SciFi collection! Very satisfied,look forward to finding more an Amazon.Com!!"
2,Them,"""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" spends a lot of time reaching for plausibility. The producers brought in Kenneth Tobey -- ""The Thing from Another World"" -- to help get it off the ground. A little more of him in the film might have helped. We also get a food first glimpse of a very young Lee Van Cleef. If you want to know how they did monsters before computer graphics, the answer is Ray Harryhausen. He was the father of most today's movie special effects. The superb giant dinosaur in this movie is his creation.""Them"" is probably one of my all time favorites primarily because of the intergral way in which the monsters -- giant ants -- fit into the movie. There was no doubt that the movie was about Them and was among the first to blame perfect, giant mutations on atomic bomb radiation. I'd call it the classid B-grade sci-fi movie. An entertaining watch."
1,Not in color!,"Amazon lists these classics as being in color. They are not. Harryhausen has announced that some of his films were being colorized. They have yet to be released. If you have these classics separately, there is nothing new here."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD mainly for THEM and luckily enough that worked. The other side of the disc doesn't play at all. Because it was so cheap, I decided to keep it. I can see that the rest of the stock has the same problem so it would do no good to return it anyway! The separate version of THEM is $18, so I still got a bargain."
1,Multiple Defective DVD's,"Purchased the DVD for the Beast From 20,000 Fathoms. The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms didn't play on 3 different DVD players. Returned and ordered a replacement, it too had the same issue and I asked, and received a refund. THEM on the reverse side worked fine, however I already have that movie as a single. I didn't read the reviews because I knew the movie; I should have read those reviews. Others have experienced the same issue. Disappointed that Amazon.com continues to sell this product when so many have encountered the same problem. Must say that Amazon.com did refund my purchase price promptly."
1,Defective Disk,"Despite having tried it on two different DVD players, ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" will not play. ""Them"", plays fine, but it's the other movie that I really wanted. I returned it to Amazon for a refund."
5,Beautiful!,"This version of Schubert's Notturno D879, is the very best you can find. The Altenberg Trio no longer make cd's. If you can get your hands on this cd, you will not be dissappointed!"
5,Brings the fun back to computers,"I bought one of these for my father who had previously had little luck with his windows laptop. Unfortunately, while 'testing it' I got hooked and had to buy one for myself. It is beautifully designed, from the feel of the case to the OS X software and is a very addictive machine. I don't feel the need for a larger screen: I like its compact size and low weight. It isn't the fastest laptop on the block, but is snappy enough for everything I need at home including Photoshop and occasional office work.If you buy this laptop you do need to buy more RAM, especially for Photoshop and you don't need to, but you will also find yourself buying a digital camera, an Ipod MP3 player and finally a DV camcorder as well.The sign of true addiction though is the purchase of the Airport Base station and card. True laptop bliss is sitting in the garden surfing the web... this is the first computer to bring the fun back into computing for a long time."
2,Nice laptop but be prepared for some problems,"I really enjoy my iBook when it works. I not very computer savy and it is perfect for a novice like me. My main complaint is that I have had to send it back twice for repairs. The first time the screen died. I mean just died. I turned it on, heard a pop, and that was it. Sending it back wasn't much trouble, but by the time I got it back about three weeks had passed. Then it stop booting and made a funny grinding noise. They sent me a new hard drive (quickly this time) but that didn't do the trick. I just sent the whole thing back and I haven't got it back yet. So I love it, but I really wish it was more reliable."
2,Not the best,I finally got one which is not easy in Hungary where nobody uses Apple. I would have to say that it is very cheaply made next to HP or Dell. I dont like Windows too much and I thought I would like Apple better however they are almost exactly the same. Next time I will just buy a cheap machine and put Linux on it.
1,Took mine back to the store,"As a long time Mac user at home / pc user at work I feel like Apple has done a good job of staying just above or just below the PC in performance. I decided it was time for an upgrade and the only notebook in my budget was the iBook so I spent as much as I could to get the best iBook possible.The end result?My iBook takes minutes to do what my PC at work does in seconds. I work in advertising and spend most of my life working Adobe products. My iBook crawls at task that I have gotten used to taking no time at all. I found it was not usuable for anything ""advanced"".I'll grant you that it was fine for web browsing and Office but that was about it. I actually took mine back to the store and got my money back. Now I am stuck deciding whether to buy a Windows notebook or borrow money and by a G4 notebook. I am not happy with Apple at all about this. I am a loyal Mac user and I don't expect to be taken for a ride. I guess the fact is the G3 needs to be retired."
2,Not quite what I expected.,"The book has several innacuracies in the chords, and I am not generally pleased with the setup on the music. The chords are presented at the beginning and then are called out by letter name. There are also several typos and other errors, it was cheap so I do not regret the expense, but I would not recommend it."
2,A book for noobs.,"This book was alright but comes off to be very lazy. There is basically 0nly a place for cords, no picking tabs, and there was also a typo on one of the songs. If you're a beginner this could give you a good concept of what to play to get the general sound of the featured radiohead songs... but if you are intermediate or advanced with your guitar skills I would recommend steering clear of this unofficial book. Street spirit didn't even have tabs and for the most part the cords seemed incorrect. There are no strumming patters written out with the music either. So yeah... I was not very impressed by this particular book. If you want to play Radiohead songs I would recommend any of their official song books."
4,Wonderful Collections of the Best,"I didn't come away learning much about weddings; however, the images are inspiring. Maybe you should buy this book combining with Glen Johnson's who has more practical tips and suggestions."
3,Okay Book,This book is okay. Its got good photos from good photographers but it doesn't push the envelope. I picked up another wedding book that blew my mind called Wedding Photography - A Guide to Posing. The title is lame but the book has amazing photos. I'd go for Wedding Photography - A Guide to Posing before I bought this one.
5,A goldmine for the digital wedding photographer!!!,"The digital age has arrived and Bill Hurter depicts why it is also the golden age of photography. Digital photography offers an unlimited ceiling of opportunity for both photographers and their clients, especially in the feild of wedding photography. In this book you will acquire the knowledge to exploit these opportunities to produce premium images. The format transitions nicely from the preparation stages to equipment, techniques, workflow, color perfection, photoshop strategies and digital albums. The words of dozens of accomplished professionals illustrate from cover to cover and their insight help exemplify the author's quest."
4,Smokin',Very good quality for the price and the color of the gemstone was clear and evenly colored-Proud to wear these smokin' smoky topaz earrings
1,not satisfied,Unfortunately when these earrings arrived they were 2 different colors and there also was a visible speck in the one stone....I sent them back and ordered another style and was p;eased with them..
4,just what I was looking for!,"My husband gave me an amethist pendant 2 years ago as a gift. Since then, I have been searching for matching earrings. My son gave me an Amazon gift card for Mother's Day this year and I found these earrings. They are beautiful and now I have a complete set!"
3,Okay if you like lavendar,"I have no complaints about the quality of the setting, gold is very high right now so the fact that you can get these for less than 50 bucks is pretty impressive, and the setting is very nice and solid. The color of the stones in mine though, well...they were very very light purple. It wasn't my cup of tea, I was hoping for a darker purple, a more saturated color, but if you like pastel purple, then you'll love these. The cut and clairty was good, and the size was nice, I just wish they had been a little darker since I'm very fair skinned- being too light just means they disappear on me. My teenage daughter loves them though, and she's worn them on a few special occasions. I'd certainly rec. these earrings for anyone looking for a nice gift, especially for a teenager or young woman. They're comfortable to wear and look clean and sophisticated- great for casual wear or when you want just a little bit of color."
3,More likely baby pink than purple,"They are nice size, but color is not very bright.My pair is almost like baby pink color. I still love them though."
5,Just what I wanted,"I was afraid these earrings would be too large but they are just what I wanted. Not too small as to be invisible but not large enough to weight down my earlobes. Color is beautiful, cut is symmetrical. I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,way too small,"These earrings appear to be a decent size in the photograph, but when I received them they were not much bigger than small diamond studs. They were so tiny and because of the subtle color, any one would have to look hard just to be able to tell I was even wearing earrings. For the price I paid I need a smoky earring that people will see. Not one that people need glasses to find. If these earrings were larger I might have really liked them. But for now I'm sorry I will be sending these back."
5,Happy!!!!,"Lovely pair of earrings in just the right size...perfect for double pierced ears with a coordinating larger hoop or dangle earring, or to wear by themselves. Rich brown coloring."
4,Nice but quite small,"These earrings are smaller than I expected them to be and do not show at all in my ears. Maybe it's because my hair is brown plus their size...?The gold in them is substantial and the stones are a reasonable quality for the price. If you purchase these and prefer earrings that are femnine and delicate, you'll enjoy owning these and they are worth the price of $39"
2,Are not as they appear in print,"The smoky-quartz stone was very light and appeared just lightly tinted. In addition, there was no way to determine the actual size of the stones from the online description. They were much smaller than I anticipated. They might have been a nice earring under other circumstances, but it was not what I thought I was ordering. They might be a nice earring for a teen girl."
3,The movie content is terrific.,"Initial setting is in LA and the character of Kwaku steals your heart as he conquers his fears. The music is engaging as the story moves to the continent of Africa and story tellers enact various folk stories. I will use this video in the classroom as I teach and it will provide many opportunities to share. I give it 3 stars due to the poor quality of the video. Picture is very grainy and sometimes hard to see due to excessive copying. If the producer could improve the video quality, this would be a great presentation."
2,Huh?,"After a promising start this book gets boring and confusing fast. Every chapter you have to figure out where you are, what year it is and who is in the scene. The reference at the beginning of each chapter is helpful but with the constant jumping around there is no continuity and you get lost too easily. If you can get past the first 3/4 of the book the last 1/4 is fairly good."
3,Reads like fiction,"But it's not. Fascinating look at the system's hunters. The only drawback is that the author sometimes leads you to action, only to cut away and never fully answers your questions. A good read."
3,Compositional foresight,"3 1/2Like most bands who concentrate on finding their own sound you could tell something special was there, but to be defined so well at such an early release shows genuine vision in place. It isn't the greatest of their short-lengths for sure, but might just be for significant reasons to some. But for me an arguably better, if rougher cut of Tigermilk's lead-off and the beautifully quirky self titled closer matter most."
5,Works.,"Well, it's a physical adapter. It does what it's supposed to. You still need a voltage converter, of course."
1,Didn't work for my purpose.,I thought this would work for my laptop charger once I moved to Germany. It did not. I didn't even take it to Germany with me. Honestly wasn't any problem because it cost so little.
5,Works!,Worked like a charm in Turkey. Recessed outlets everywhere we went posed no problem for this little gadget. Fit our power converter unit.
4,A showcase for the versatility of Gilberto Gil!,"Gilberto Gil concocts a blend of such diverse styles as bossa nova, Bahian, pop, rock, and country(!), on this haunting CD, with his agile voice flavoring the brew. Great songs performed by awesome musicians. Buy it!"
5,Great Autobiography for Remi in you.,Full of wonderful gems. Perfect example of what a living Buddha would do. Shabkar embodies the Remi movement of Tibet.
5,Queda la Musica,"This book is a masterpiece,written by the acclaimed Dominican novelist and poet, Rene Rodriguez Soriano.Once you pick this book up, you can't put it down. You have to finish it.As you read it, passions and emotions are evoked!"
2,No new information and rather adolescent.,"Despite some excellent photos of reeactments and participants, the text offered little new information and parts of it were rather adolescent. There are other better books on the topic, such as ""Legionary, the Roman Soldier's Unofficial Manual"" by Philip Matyszak. Save your money."
3,no color at all,"I was disappointed with the color of the stone. There was no color, where I expected a light color as shown on the site. I have no complaints about the quality of the stud, but I was disappointed with the stone color."
2,Not at all like the picture! WASHED-OUT COLOR!!!,These earrings have no blue in them! The picture is extremely deceiving!
3,Vampire's Kiss,"Although the movie has an interesting concept, not the humor I was led to believe. Although an interesting concept, the dark humor is not near as good as I expected."
1,I had to turn in off,"I just couldn't finish this movie... that's how much I hated it. It is suppose to be a type of spoof? I hope so, but either way Nicholas Cage's performance is absolutely annoying."
1,What were you thinking Nick,Every actor has at least one movie that he wishes would just go away and i hope that Nicolas Cage picks this as his. Just an awful movie that should disappear.
3,Strange,"Odd movie that did zero at the box office and became a cult favorite. I bought it a few years ago for $9.99 off of a remainder shelf, remembering that I'd seen and liked it a long time before and deciding it was worth that small price. Well, it was, and probably worth more. I can't give it five stars--only ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Goodfellas"" or ""M"" deserve that kind of rating--and it's not quite a four, but certainly just misses that rating. This movie is funny, with Nicholas Cage doing (some might say overdoing) his role as an uptight literary agent who suddenly comes to believe he's a vampire in an unforgettably mannered, twitchingly insane way. ""Am I getting THROUGH to you, Alva?"""
4,This movie deserves a Blu-ray release,"I had some trouble hearing the dialog due to issues, I think, with the way the dvd's audio quality.Still, this movie warrants a watch if you are even remotely a fan of Nic (and you should be).I would buy this on Blu-ray if it came out."
5,Superb Massage Book; Travels Well,"We took this book along on our South Pacific adventure. What a great way to make new friends. Unlike other massage books, the techniques here work as promised. We had many romantic afternoons and evenings thanks to The New Massage. Bravo!"
1,Techton 4582 regulator,"Not worth the money. Find something better and spend the exta money. This regulator is junk, all it does is let the volume of air escape and loos your pressure causing the compressor to run more often than needed."
3,A helpful book,"This book can help you in asking simple question in variety of daily conversations. But it is a bookf or studying the language deeply, because it does not cover grammar. I did like the book becaus of the structure, each chapter takes place in a different place such as: Camping, buying clothes etc. And, every chapter includes many question.That way you can get by easily and ask for almost any important item in the grocery store. But As I said before, and after comparing this item to others it is not a fully course in thr Russian language."
3,What'd I say?,"Cowboys, jarheads, bank r...oh, heck, you've heard it before, and only the second of the above is involved in this book anyway, along with Child's old standby...shotgun weddings shotgun weddings shotgun weddings."
2,Liked it first spin and now I don't,"I checked this out from the library and I thought to myself ""hey this sounds alright"". I even wrote down that the album was good enough to buy. I went on secondspin and bought it eventually.It took me about a year to get around to spinning it again as there is so many other cds hogging my ear. Well, we got a problem. The album has 20 tracks and it takes an hour to finish it. I'm really disappointed here. I'm putting it back on my shelf knowing I'll never spin it again.It sounds like the White Stripes except less interesting. There wasn't really any tracks that caught my ear. I regret this purchase. I would borrow the cd from a friend first."
3,Some talent here,"I can understand people hating the singer of this group, but for some reason I did not. He sounds like Billy Corgan on helium, screeching and caterwauling with bristling energy. There are a few good songs (brevity being a good thing in several instances). If you enjoy the White Stripes then I think you'll enjoy this, so open your wallet, get out your credit card and ""Add to Cart""."
2,"Well crafted songs, but .........","The songs are written in an appealing fashion, and the lead guitar and drumming work very well together. Unfortunately, the lead singer's voice just isn't going to cut it. He is off key and quite annoying. He simply can't sing. This group could do well with a decent vocalist. The lyrics are also pretty lame. Anyone over eighteen years of age will be expecting a little more from the song verses. Four stars for the music, but the vocals make this a CD I can't recommend."
1,Willowz ... are you kidding me?,"This album is a failed attempt to get in the hipster dumbass club. 20 tracks of pretenious self involved crap. There actually are a couple decent songs, but it also might be good if it was their 4th or 5th album, you when bands go to the desert to find themselves. They just re invented themselves after being a band for about one year, when they should have stayed true to their roots. If you want to hear a good Willowz record, buy the first one ""Willowz s/t"".Vortex 2.0"
2,Playing lets it down,"When I bought this CD, near the beginning of my classical listening career, my reaction was very negative, due to the very rough character of the orchestral playing. On revisiting this recording, I find a capable interpretation from the conductor, with fine, characterful instrumental soloists - but the ensemble playing is still very rough, to the point that it makes pleasurable listening difficult.This recording is attibuted to Henry Adolph, but I think this is a pseudonym for Anton Nanut, who recorded all the Mahler cycles with his Slovakian orchestra (I recommend his recordings of symphonies 1, 5 and especially 6). I discarded the Point Classics CD years ago, but I now have a recording of 4 on the Cantus label, credited to Nanut, which I believe is the same recording as this. I've heard mention of a Nanut recording that uses a boy singer, but it's a soprano on both this CD and the Cantus one."
4,"Gorgeous, only a couple of songs short of greatness","This album sounds great to me, I don't even mind Dawn McCarthy's accompanying vocals - they fit the context of these songs perfectly for me.This album was a surprise for me after listening to Bonnie Prince Billy's recent work. I think I was expecting something more stripped-back, but this lush album cemented him as one of my favourite musicians in my collection.I love the modern-folk sound throughout this album, my only reservation is that it could have maybe just one or two more great songs, to bump it up to 5 stars.Or they could just edit out the ""... hey little bird ..."" part off the end of ""No Bad News"" and leave ""I called you back"" off the album altogether. Just my 2c, sorry Will - I still love your work!"
3,Surprisingly strong,3 1/2Unusually effective outing for an artist I generally find highly overrated and compositionally weak.
3,Comes and goes...,"Some excellent pieces, but some head scratchers as well. This is for dedicated fans of the artist."
4,Just Right,"perfect for the average user... probably not for a pc gamer... but for email, managing my music supply, papers, cruising the web, and all the other basic daily computer tasks i do... wouldn't need anything more..."
5,Thinking of switching? Don't hesitate! This is the one!,"I can say, without a doubt, this is the best computer I have used in the seven years I have owned PC/Macs. I switched from Mac to PC in 2001 and switched *back* after seeing all the features, style and value on offer from Apple with the new iBook.Ready out-of-the-box for email, Internet, video editing, playing MP3s, printing photos, even burning CD-Rs. And all with the integrated easy to use and hassle free Mac OS X.I can attest to the claims of 6 hour battery life, the wireless web works flawlessly and is a cinch to install. In fact, everything works so well that until I sat down to write this I had forgotten how good I've got it!"
2,Doesn't even get the rules right,"Don't get me wrong, it has the very basic rules right. But it does not follow poker rules when it comes to:* Who pays which blind during heads-up play* What the minimum raise amount is* Announcing raises (the pros make string bets!)In addition, the visuals are cluttered, and the blind and ante levels aren't always displayed.Despite all this, it's kind of fun -- but not as much fun, or challenging, as playing free online poker with play money."
2,Not A Good Game,"When I purchased this game I was hoping to have some reasonable AI, but I was dissappointed. All the players play the same; it doesn't matter if you are going against T.J. Cloutier or Gus Hanson, they play the same in this game. When the cpu gets any pair they jam the pot till they are allin. If they have no pair, they simply give up. This programming is way too immature for the serious player; however, the price is reasonable for the low quality entertainment it provides."
2,You got to be kidding,HIi barely know how to play Texas Holdem but if the superstars on tv weren't any better than the AI on this game i'd be superstar #1....the game is so easy to win at it's not worth playing.
5,Not for the Pro's,"This is a great game for novice's and/or beginners! I downloaded it about a year ago, before I new a flush from a straight. since then..I've won the millon $ multiple times.Best of all, I like kickin' the pro's butt!I highly recommend this one."
4,"""All In""","I downloaded this game and played for 1 hour straight no interruptions. I am 14 and am just getting into poker. It is a great game. I finished 4th, 5th, and 7th. It seemed very short. I can't wait to buy the game. The one flaw was that it didn't look exactly like a fox sports broadcast like the people said. Their was no odds of if I would win. No announcing and nobody saying all in just pushing a button. I can't wait to buy it."
3,Wrong Booboo,"I bought this set because it had all of the Belafonte songs I was looking for. It has Danny Boy, Jamaica Farewell, Mama Look A Booboo, and Mary's Boy Child. Danny Boy is an amazing performance and can't be found easily. Perhaps my favorite Belafonte song, Mama Look A Booboo, is available out there somewhere in a better version, because the version on this record isn't anywhere near as good as the live version, the one with Harry laughing and playing with the lyrics. The other material on this cd set isn't up to the standard of Belafonte's very best, but then again, not much is."
1,Why?,"Why does this game exist in the first place? It's literally a slot machine, in your pocket. Basically you press the A button and watch the slots spin and then if lady luck is on your side you gain more credits, however, if not, you lose credits.Here's the problem, that's all it is, slot machines, there is no real strategy, it's mainly just luck, I'm surprised they even made a slot machine game, it seems like a real waste, especially for the price.I only sugguest this game if you find it very, very cheap AND if you're collecting NeoGeo Pocket items, but if you want a gaming experiance I say nay."
4,Boooooring,"This game is not fun. All you do is hit the button like pulling the handle in real life. I thought it would have something else to it like cards, but no, you just use the one button."
4,La rana viajera Articulos humoristicos by Julio Camba,"La rana viajera is a series of travel articles about different countries. It is witty, with plenty of humour and well written. The only drawback is that it is a student edition with exercises and a glossary of words and their meaning. I enjoyed it despite its drawback because I am a Spanish language teacher and I think that it works well with students"
3,cheeseman platter,Product itself is great but it took so long to arrive at its destination even with expedited shipping costs. I am not sure I would use again unless I ordered weeks in advance!
5,Smells Great,"This lotion is rated with a low hazard in Skin Deep's database. It feels great on your skin, is light but a good moisturizor and my favorite part is the wonderful smell. Free of parabens, sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates."
5,As Deep As Purple,"With Nicky Simper (bass) of the original Deep Purple lineup as the founding member, it's little wonder that this album's work is very close to his former band. Singer Ashley Holt sounds like a cross between Rod Evans and Ian Gillan (complete with patented scream) and Mac Poole has the early Ritchie Blackmore guitar sound down to a tee. The songs are organ-driven heavy rock in the very tradition of Deep Purple and Uriah Heep. Fans of those bands are almost sure to be won over. This album is a gem of early UK progressive hard rock, and before the band turned to a more R&B style on Red Sea. Just as Rod Evans proved his talents with Captain Beyond, so did Nicky Simper prove that he was a hard rock soldier to be reckoned with. It was Deep Purple's loss. This album rocks!"
5,Splendid resource for students in California non-ABA law schools!,"If you're in a non-ABA law school (mostly found in California, Alabama, Tennesse and Massachusetts) then these Torts flash cards are wonderful! The first 250 cards or so cover things like the evolution of contributory negligence to comparitive negligence in the 46 states that use the comparitive negligence doctrine. The format of these cards is fun and tests your knowlege of black letter essentials using actual names in situations that are spoofs of your favorite cartoon characters from childhood such as 'Wiley Coyote' These torts flash cards are wonderful! These flash cards can always be found on Amazon for $20 to $30 which law students know is a very good price!"
2,Just Okay,"I think law students will get more out of other study aids. It was not concise enough to use as a supplement to a class, outline and it should not replace your class outline."
1,"Good product, bad bookstore","Cards came in out or order, some obviously had been drenched in water, still yet others were missing all together. Terrible."
2,Worked good until it broke,"This release tool worked well until it broke. However, I found it easy to use, didn't require you to touch the fish while releasing it, and conveniently hung on my wading jacket out of the way until I needed it.Unfortunately, the plastic is somewhat brittle and thin, and my midge tool broke at the end that the hook fits into. I was in the process of releasing a large brown when it decided to shake; causing the hook running through the head to snap the plastic side off."
5,I have to eat crow,"""This I promised you,"" has changed my mind about N'Sync.Its not just the great songwritting by Richard Marx,but the fantastic vocals by the band.Everytime this numbers on the radio,I have to turn it up."
3,Could be better,"Live was so much better. It just does not sound all that well on this CD. Go and see them live if you can, you will enjoy it!"
4,once a taker always a taker,"I am a sceptic when it comes to stuff I feel like I have heard somewhere else. I have heard her voice and it was Fiona apple meets bjork in a qiurky world built by Jeff Buckly. I listen to the first song and I was overwhelmed by chills up and down my arms. Now, I cant stop thinking about it.some albums you just cant help but give it a try and try try again. Then you love it. and you cant stand to be with out."
1,Intensly Bad,"I wanted desperately to love this album and I'm not entirely sure what I'm missing because based on all of the other reviews I shouldn't find it dull, laborious and smugly pleased with itself; but that's how I find it. Every song is in pretty much the same key (always a very serious and pretentious minor key) and the sound is predictable regardless of what kind of weird pseudo-punk beatboxing she tries to do over the tedious background piano flap. So, so, so disappointing."
2,Way over rated,"Some reviewer compared this group to Bjork. This is in no way shape or form as innovative as Bjork, and compared to Vespertine, its just garbage. I heard a reveiw of this on NPR, and I bought it based on the review and a few samples. If you're impressed simply by the fact that the singer has ""classical"" training then get it.My guess is that you know someone who has an album thats more deserving of critical acclaim than this one, and you might find that fact to be a nagging annoyance everytime you listen."
4,Best rock group ever,"I honestly believe that Status Quo is the best rock group ever, except for the Beatles. These guys don't mess around, they just rock & roll the way it should be. I now have most of their music on cd, and cant keep from playin one of them on a regular basis. I just wish that the old USA rock and rollers would get on the rock bandwagon. I can't believe how NOT well known they are here in the states. I would love to see them gear up and do a USA tour. If U are readin this U are Quo music lover, so buy it & buy one of their DVD's and watch these guys live."
5,MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!,This was a really good movie. Much better than I expected. I ran out and bought it as soon as it came out!!!
5,Pirates Kicks Butt!!,"This is one of my all-time favourite films of all time!!!!! Orlando, Johnny, and Kiera act marvelously in this high-paced action/adventure flick!!!! If you haven't seen this movie, YOU MUST SEE IT!!!! It's absolutely wonderful and fun!!!"
1,Big framing problem on Blu-ray version,"Disney made some mistakes on the Blu-ray release and some scenes are misframed. The original film was shot using the Super 35 process (1.85:1) and cut to a 2:35:1 ratio for theaters and home release. Some scenes that required framing at the top of the film image were center cut instead, so heads are cut off, and there are numerous revealing mistakes such as exposed floorboards when they should be fighting on rafters 10 ft off the ground! I would wait for a corrected version."
3,Priates of the Caribbean,"I reallt thought for 3 disk it would be something special, they have the 2 disk one at Wal-mart for $12.98 and has all the same stuff as the 3 disk for less than half the price. For that I am a little uphappy about my purchase."
5,Pirates of the Caribbean: What a Movie!,"I have seen Pirates of the Caribbean twice now, and I will be seeing it again. I just can't get over what an awesome job Johnny Depp did in this movie. Just to see the wonderful facial expressions is worth the ticket price. No one else could have played Captain Jack Sparrow with as much heart or style. Without him, this movie probably wouldn't have been 1/2 as good.Without a doubt, this is the best film I have seen in my life. It has everything without any dull or slow parts. For a 2 1/2 hour movie, it moved right along. I wouldn't have changed a thing. Hats off to Depp and Disney for this wonderfully exciting picture. I'll be seeing it again, and again, and again...."
5,Wonderful,"Need I say more? The film was a visual-feast, and the DVD is loaded with fantastic extras. A MUST have! Depp well deserved the SAG award. Buy it now!"
5,"Fun, fun fun!","This was one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long, long while. Johnny Depp's entrance is now permanently ensconced in my top five movie moments ever. It was brilliant! Considering the hit-and-miss nature of Disney entertainment of late, I was guarded in my expectations. Happily, I was delighted rather than disappointed. Almost all ages could enjoy the rollicking adventure. I say almost, because the ghost pirates could easily scare the very young (but what special effects!). The characters were fun (Depp's was genius), the location was perfect, and the story very engaging. I would highly reccomend Pirates of the Caribbean to anyone with a sense of adventure!"
4,One of the best movies of 2003.A must see for a pirate fan.,"This is one great movie.I absolutely love it. Johnny Depp is absolutely fantastic as Captain Jack Sparrow. He looks great and his acting is incredible. Im not gay or bisexual or anything but I must say I love the way he looks as that character and the movie is great just because of that character there is plenty of action,great acting and above all skeletons in this movie. I think its a must see."
4,major deppth...,"usually i'm skeptical of movies that were inspired by disney theme park rides, and especially movies with johnny depp in them, but after seeing this movie, i'm totally gaga about the sea, pirates, and disney theme parks. it's a fun romp with its own unique comtemporary spin, and yet it has all the elements of a traditional adventure story. there's everything from romance, to sword fighting, and ships, and blood and gold, and a devestatingly sExAy johnny depp as captain jack sparrow. even his name was cool. the movie's got everything. it's intense enough to get you into the characters and the plot, but light enough that you don't have to cry and mope around for days after seeing it. totally awesome. arr! drink up me hearties, yo ho!"
5,Surprise Hit,"When I saw this movie I instantly liked it. The idea, the locations, the actors/actresses, everything said ""I am a good movie"". And it kept getting better as the Pirates 2 and 3 came out."
3,"I finished, barely, and my husband did not!","It was strange to me that the movie was funny, the acting fine, yet the story not engaging. Perhaps because I'm in my forties and am looking for more depth. Or maybe the movie failed to move beyond humor into character development, thus leaving me with no concern for the story's outcome.I expect that if I were in my teens or twenties, I would love this movie. So, go ahead and view. But rent before you buy!"
5,Pirates of the Caibbean.,"Pirates of the caribbean is a film sutible for any age group it is an action filled film starring Johnny Depp ( secret window, blow, Edward sissor hands), Orlando bloom, geoffery Rush, Keira Knightly etc.. This film has laughs, jokes, fights every thing a kids like us likes.The special effects are amazing and i can garenteed that whoever watches this film will be satisfied.!!!!!!"
3,"too violent for the little ones, but overall entertaining","I DON'T LIKE THE WAY SO MANY MOVIES ARE MADE WITH EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE FOR KIDS, AND THIS WAS PRETTY VIOLENT. TOO MUCH GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS FOR A SMALL BOY, NO MATTER THE RATINGS. I ENJOYED THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE OF THIS VIDEO, BUT THE EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE MAKES IT A NO SHOW FOR MY DAUGHTER AND HER BOYS."
2,This is not Johnny Depp.....,"The movie is not terrible, but it does get old. Johnny Depp does give a good performance, because he is a phenomenoal actor. But... this is not the real Johnny Depp. He did this movie for his kids, so don't get used to it. Johnny made a name for himself by doing movies out of the mainstream, the last place he wanted to be. He didn't want to be in the public's eye at all times. So, he did bizarre movies and pulled his role off brillantly. When I saw the movie i understood why he did it, but was very upset by what happened as a result of his performance. And the movie is not really THAT good, come on.So, 2 stars for Johnny's performance, but don't judge him buy this and don't expect him to do that many of these (except for the sequels and ""Finding Neverland"", which he is doing in hopes to get his well deserved Oscar)"
2,Wonderful Movie crappy format,There is only one reason that I didn't rate this movie 5 stars is because it is only available in WideScreen. Just because the people that make DVD's get more profit from Widescreen is clearly a sign that they don't care what the public wants and I personally find that notion distasteful plus the fact that I want to see all of my screen and not just the middle of it!
2,Slightly disappointed,"As pirate movies go,I suppose ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a quality movie. I'm certainly no expert on that. However, I am an expert on ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", the ride at Disney Land. Usually, I will ride it 6-7 times when I'm visiting the park. So, you can understand how I was more than a little excited that my favorite ride was becoming a movie.Sadly, what I got was little more than a meager bone thrown my way. Director Gore Vidal has taken a stunning experience, and added useless new characters and plot, showing situations that were never in the original ride. What's more, the classic ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" song is hardly heard at all here. It's heard throughout the ENTIRE ride, Gore.If you're in the mood for a pirate movie, I guess this is the place to come (although don't overlook the underrated ""Pirate Movie"" from the early 80s). If you're looking for the ride captured on film, better just save your money and buy a ticket to Disney Land. (or World)"
2,The pirate alphabet...,"ARRH!, AYE!, (spits) TEA?!: If you would like to see a Disney (read: children and pre-teens) version of pirates, by all means see this with the aforementioned--however, if you want to see something with an actual plot, with actual suspense and with an actual idea of who the heroes and who the villians are, instead of pandering to the actors/audience's idea of who they should be, stick with the Harryhausen ""Sinbad"" movies--also, Depp was much better, more believable and less ""quirky"" in the new ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" movie--THAT one deserves a spin-off with his character, not this hold of bilgewater!"
3,"A Disneyland ride yes, a swashbuckler no, not really.","The special effects in this film are spectacular. The CGI graphics were stunning. The individal actors were quite good. The problem was, to quote Fonzie from Happy Days, is that they are like ketchup and hot fudge. Alone they are great, but put them together and...terrible.The substance for the story was not really there; the ending just fizzled. If you are looking for a visually stunning film, this is it. If you would rather have a good plot and action, rent Muntiny on the Bounty."
1,Utterly Disapointing...,"DON'T LISTEN TO ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS!!!I had heard from all my friends that this was one of the best movies they have ever seen... I wanted so bad to see it! I finally bought it after all the talk was going around that the second one was coming out. I felt like I had to watch it and not fall behind on the series.It was a super-slow movie throughout the entire 2 hours. The plot was pointless. The ladies dresses were revealing. The pirates used the word ""bloody"" a lot. Certain things that were wrong crept in as truths. I come from a christian family and we all sat down and watched it and all had the same response.Other than good and well-known actors and actresses this movie was utterly disapointing.I'm not one that is very picky on the movies I like. I love movies like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, National Treasure. But I just couldn't understand why everyone was apprasing it with 5 stars!This in not one, by far, that I would watch again."
1,UGGHHHHHH Will this movie ever end!!!!,"Absolutely tiresome and predictable. Not often do I want to actually walk out of a movie, but I managed this time. The fight scenes were too long and the scenes were corny (now, don't get me wrong I LOVE campy movies but this was cheesy in a bad way). I never want to see it AGAIN!"
1,"It's Disney. What did you expect, the Matrix","This movie sucked. Along with boring dragged out story plot, you've got the corny fighting scenes and the crappy actors excluding johnny depp. Don't even waste your money on anything with Disney's label on it because you know it's gonna be an overall waste of time."
5,Awesome and Fun,"This was a really fun movie! We took out 8 (boy) and 4 (girl) yr old children to this movie and they were glued to the screen. They both really enjoyed it. There might be one or two scenes that might be too scary for many children, however (hence the rating of pg-13). As a reference, my children sat through ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" with out any problems, but one of their friends (a 6 yr old girl) had to leave for most of the end. All in all an excellent family movie!"
3,Depp To The Rescue,"We rented this flick with high hopes - Depp being one of our favorite actors. And he delivered! Always amusing, clever, couldn't take our eyes off him. HOWEVER. The movie itself was frequently incomprehensible. It was hard for us to figure out just who was doing what and to whom, and why. For comprehensive plot description, we had to read these other reviews! Not the best way to enjoy a movie."
3,Not so special,"Although the movie itself and second CD are great, the third ""Lost"" CD is not really worth the extra $10. Since the second CD gives you all the background and special effects you could want, there's no need to stretch it out in a third. An obvious ploy to make more money."
2,"Strictly kids' stuff, and way too long!","I wasn't expecting much from this movie -- basically mindless entertainment. And it was somewhat entertaining, though VERY cliched, for about the first hour. The scenery is beautiful and the cast is great. But, as other reviewers said, there are WAY too many interminable sword fights and marine battles. And my God, why did they make this film almost 2-1/2 hours long? I was getting restless after 90 minutes, and after two hours I finally threw in the towel. Johnny Depp isn't bad, but as other viewers said, many times he races through his lines so fast that you can't understand them, which I find VERY frustrating and annoying."
5,Fantastic!,"This movie was SO entertaining with little, if any, of the usual [stuff] Hollywood throws in to sell movies. I was captivated from the opening credits until the extra tidbit after the closing credits which predicts a sequel. [YAY!!] Orlando Bloom made my heart go boom and Johnny Depp was fantastic! He made me want to be a pirate. If you haven't seen this movie, don't wait another second. It is well worth the price of admission."
4,A lot of fun...,"I had went into this movie with a lot of skepticism but when I walked out, I had come to really enjoy this movie. I have to say that this movie was truly Johnny Depp's showcase. Here, he shined. It wasn't the best movie of the summer because it ran quite long and at times dragged. But overall, I will buy it when it comes out on DVD."
5,Pirates DVD,Purchased this as a gift and the recepient loved the DVD. Item was shipped on time and received as advertised.
5,Deppinately Watch this,Good family fun ... and you can still drink like your a pirate .. never forget that.
4,Hot Shot Acting by Johnny Depp,"This movie is just plain fun! It makes you want to act when you see Johnny Depp putting so much creative energy into his character. The shots are magnificent. The ships battling were so true to life. The beautiful scenery of the island of Tortuga and the water shots just made the film come to life. The ride at Disneyland can take on new meaning. They showed parts of the actual ride in the film so all of us could relate. I liked the creative touch of making the pirates into ghosts under a curse. This was a really good movie, the plot was easy to follow but the director made this into an extravangaza. He also directed The Ring, and made that movie into a real scary treat. The other actors were good as well but Depp knows how to feel and turn a character into a character!Lisa Nary"
1,Didn't work.,"I like the movie, but it wouldn't play past the first couple seconds, and Amazon hasn't replied to my help request."
5,Ahoy Pirates!,I am kind of new to the blue ray experience but this is one of my all time favorite movies. The story line was outstanding and the characters are fascinating to watch interact. I love the story but when it comes to being on Blue Ray it is even better.The picture quality is phenomenal on our new digital television and clear as if I were on the set. It's well worth the money and the quality is amazing.Well worth the investment and the money.Pirates are awesome by the way. ;)
2,Total Disapointment,"This movie...how do you say, reeked of dog excrement? Yes, I, like so many before me looked forward to seeing this movie. It seemed to have badass pirate-itude in all the trailers. What happened? I watched this movie, and saw what could best be described as an ""attempt"" at a good pirate movie. They had everything they needed to make one....except a good script. Next time lets hope they write thier way into something good. This movie totally jumped the shark.When I found out it was made by Disney, my disgust turned more to pity. I haven't seen a good movie by these folks since the Lion King. Considering who made it, its very good. That said, this movie gets two stars, and I am being generous."
3,Pretty good movie,It is a pretty good movie and the graphics are very cool. However I would not really sugest this movie to children under the age of 10 until the parent has seen it first.There are some parts in the movie that could be scarry to some children. Other than that I liked the movie very much and suggest you get yourself a copy.
4,"A very good, if not great movie","I saw it in theaters, of course, so I have no idea as to extras on the DVD, but it is a very funny, good movie. I went since my daughter is a fan of Orlando Bloom & he is not hard on the eyes for me either. The movie, itself, was very entertaining. Johnny Depp was hilarious & I am not a huge fan of his, since his films are so inconsitent, in my mind. My only complaint would be the soundtrack @ times overwhelmed but in home you can always turn it down. My other complaint is that @ times there was too much going on on screen. It could have used more close-up then cut to action (like LOTR) as in fight scenes but that was minimal. I took my 4 yr old to see it, telling her 1st that it might get scary but she was scared for only a second.Wait after credits!"
5,Yo-ho yo-ho a pirates life for me!,The greatest movie I`ve ever seen! Everyone I know has seen this movie and they all loved it! I`ve seen this movie 7 times and it never gets boring. I think everyone should see this movie. IT ROCKS!!!!!
1,MAKES A GOOD NIGHT LIGHT,"This movie is awful. It's full of everything that's been done ad nauseum in the pirate-action-adventure genre, so there's nothing new or original. It is a very boring movie; very tedious. Johnny Depp's talent was virtually wasted, and I feel for him. The only thing worth noting is that a couple of the scenes are right out of the Disneyland ride of the same name. This no doubt will benefit both ventures. If you need a night light, pop this one into your player."
1,something for everyone,"If your a kid who likes pirates, this is your movie. Plenty of action and adventure on the high seas. If your a guy, youll like Keira Knightley. ( very pretty AND a good actress) If your a lady, well its Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. If your a real pirate, think again. The bonus features offer 10 , yes 10 , hours of extras including bios of real histoical pirates and a behind the scenes look at how they made the ships, costumes and characters as accurate as possible. Johhny Depp deserves the most praise as the sometimes inept pirate Jack Sparrow. A very interesting portrail of a pirate. If you like Johnny in this , also try From Hell or Sleepy Hollow. I didnt really think Mr. Depp was a very good actor, but I was VERY wrong. Sorry about that Captain Jack, please dont make me walk the plank. Thanks for listening."
2,widescreen annoying,"Ordinarily our DVD can fill the screen on any widescreen movie, but this one is preprogrammed to override your DVD player settings giving you big fat black lines top and bottom. Friends of ours complained about the same effect on their widescreen rearprojection TV. Great movie, but who wants to spend 140 minutes looking at a tiny picture on a big TV set? I guess the people who produced the DVD want everyone to go out and buy a 10,000 dollar plasma TV."
4,Awesome movie!,You can't go wrong with this exciting and FUNNY movie! I highly recommend it. Great story. Great acting. Great special effects!
5,a lot of stars,"I love this movie. Whose idea was it to stick two of the HOTTEST men in America, no the world, no the universe, in the same movie."
4,Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl,"This movie was awesome. I will own it! At first I thought that Johnny Depp acted too effeminate for his part until it was explained that he lost his mind when marooned on the island alone. I loved all of it from the CGI to the sword battles between all the players to the happy ending. Even the booms of cannons and the destruction was all done well.As for Julieta from Boston, pirates were cruel and evil. If you think that they should have been made nicer just for your grandchildren you are very wrong. The world was tough then. Try to think about that before passing judgment on what was as realistic as possible."
2,Only for kids,"This movie has too many swashbuckling sword fight sceens. After the first hour, you'll feel like someone taped your eyes lids open, forcing you to stare into a bright light bulb.The special effects were OK, but I just wasn't interested in the story."
2,Dont believe the hype,"A movie that makes 300 million in the domestic box office must be good right? No. I almost fell asleep watching this, twice! Though, Depp's performance was quite good and original as the bi-curious pirate. Like Finding Nemo, this one is more hype than substance. Thank goodness the library lets u check out dvds for free..."
3,"ok movie, but way overhyped and over-rated","Don't get me wrong, it was very entertaining. But it was by no means the ""blockbuster"" everyone made it out to be. Johnny Depp and company do a good job. The special effects were cool. But i don't know, it was just lacking something, can't put my finger on it.For those of you who don't know or haven't seen it yet, the story is about a group of cursed pirates and two mens quest to rescue a woman they hold captive. Been there, done that....All in all, a fun ""family"" movie. I would recomend it to anyone, but would tell them It's not the best movie out there, but then again, the last 2 matrix films sucked too..."
1,Disney DVD's and Blu Rays SUCK!!!,They suck because you have to sit through endless movie previews and you can't skip them. And you have to do this EVERY TIME YOU WATCH IT!!! This is intolerable!!! DISNEY SUCKS!!
2,Where were the commercials?,"Yikes! This was pretty bad, as movies go. It had the feel of a film shot over a period of years. The characters changed personality to fit each moment as though they'd forgotten who they were yesterday. The special effects got tiresome. It was like having to listen to a car salesman chatter on what the car could do on the road when all you want is to get out there and drive. Pirates of the Caribbean reminds me of those never-seen-in-a-theater films that turn up on cable TV. You'll long for a commercial break!P.S. I'm embarrassed for Jonathan Pryce and Johnny Depp who had to stagger through this stuff."
1,Spanish,"Do not understand why not to include Spanish, at least in subtitles, I am a big fan of the series, but not everyone in my family understand English, I hope that someday get a version with the Spanish language"
4,Could have been better anyway,"Well this is a nice movie with nice characters as Disney is able to create. For sure there are two sexy actors in this movie Bloom and Depp. But Depp is the only one who really leads the story. His characters is amazing, unexpected whereas the other ones are a little bit tasteless. Besides, the CGI seems they were made 2 years ago for some PS2 video games. So what was I saying ? Yes this is a not a bad movie after all : great actors, nice landscapes, good music; but if you take Depp and Bloom away well it's just a movie.I hope the next chapter will give us a better show and such theme has the potential to do so."
1,Beware this region 2 disc will not play on DVD players in the US.,"I had no idea what Region 2 after the title meant, nor do I think most other consumers would. There should be some explanation given somewhere in the description. Region2 means that it will not play on DVD players in the US."
2,Not quite as advertised,"This item was advertised as in ""like new"" condition with all original packaging and inserts.Movie disk arrived in a timely manner, however the movie disk was far from like new condition. The disk was scratched deeply and hangs in player. The outer sleeve was not present and plastic cover for disk holder had been melted from being exposed to high heat at some point. I would think twice before reordering from this 3rd party vendor again as I was okay about the packaging issues but greatly disappointed with the ""well worn"" disk when I was expecting one in very good or like new condition."
2,Switched Off,"This is a swash-buckling, comedy-horror pirate movie that doesn't work, and is too long. Children will probably love it, although some of the special effects may be a little to horrible for very young kids.I thought it started quite well, but by the time I was 3/4 of the way through I was looking at my watch, and with about 15mins to go I gave up and turned over to watch something else. The film was much to long at 143mins. Few films justify being over 2 hours, and this film provided ample evidence of that.A waste of Johnny Depps undoubted talent. I shall not be watching the sequel."
2,Could have rented this instead of buying it....,"I think this movie is okay. Johnny Depp is excellent in this movie, but the story line gets old quickly. There are a few surprises in the end, but over all I was not impressed."
2,OVER RATED!,"I had heard so much about this movie that I couldn't wait to see it. I was very dissapointed.I am a big Disney fan so this review is not anti-Disney.Much like movies based upon video games, movies based upon theme park rides just don't work. Or haven't worked yet. This movie had everything you could ask for. Major Stars, Major Director, Major Producer but NO PLOT. That is not fair of course it had a plot, just not a good one. And the plot that they did have has so many holes in it that as the end I was left asking myself ""did I really just see what I thought I did?""Special effects were great, but once again studios don't care about the writing. How can you have a good movie without a good script?But it all comes down to box office and since this one made millions, there will be more like it and the Hulk and Dare Devil and the list could go on forever.Save your time and money. Skip this one.BUTAt least it wasn't Charlie's Angels 2"
2,Thats Interesting,"The movie was I shall say VERY INTERESTING not in the best of ways. Johnny Depp's acting was fairly good, while Orlando Bloom's acting STUNK!!!!!!!! His acting showed to little emotion or too much to the point where it made you sick.I would recomed this movie to stupid blonde headed girl who have no taste in acting or looks. Orlando Bloom looked like a colonial beach bum."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This should be more than 5 star! I reccomend it. You have to watch it. It has high adventure.
3,Extra Credit: It's not all that great - Could've been better,"I think that movie was one of the top movies of 2003, but the story line could have been better. The Character of Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp could have been more developed through dialogue. Also, the story took too long to develope and was pretty boring throughtout the entire first half. Hopefully, the second installment shall be much more action packed rather that a love story between ""will"" and ""Elizabeth""."
3,Confusing values for kids?,"I loved the special effects in this movie. It was well done -- although the fighting scenes were sometimes a bit drawn out. I worry, though, about young children's impressions of the ""good guys"" being, in reality, the ""bad guys."" Yes, it was all done in fun and I love fantasy as much as the next gal -- just hoping that parents out there are aware of some of the ideas that this movie suggests to young minds. Talk to your kids about it!(PS -- Hang onto those values Mr. Roy Disney. We love what you stand for.)"
3,Pirates ROCK,This was a good movie. better than Finding Nemo. If you liked this one check out - Equilibrium and Hirasho Hornblower as well.
5,Did You Hear About That New Pirate Movie . . . .,"It's rated ""AAARRRRRR!!!"" Hehehe...okay, okay, lame joke, I know. But, uh, this movie is anything BUT lame. And also, it's uh, not rated R either, so that's a plus for the kiddies. I have ALWAYS loved Johnny Depp. I always believed he was a fantastic actor who never got the credit he deserved. Now though, because he starred in this Bruck vehicle, he's a ""star."" Actually, Johnny's much better than a ""movie star,"" but we'll let Hollywood think what it wants. If the Academy truly gave Oscars to the BEST performances of the year, then Mr. Depp would positively have one for playing Cap'n Jack Sparrow. He gave one of the best and most original performances this year. I highly recommend this film: it's fun, the characters are great, you'll laugh your ass off, and all the while be thinking to yourself . . . but why is the rum gone?"
5,Even Better Than The First!!!!!!!!,I loved the first movie and couldn't wait to watch this one. I was pleased. There was lots of action plenty of humor and great acting. The only thing was I think the first one had more humor. But still a great film.
5,Best disney film for a while,"I had always thought disney would never make a comeback with there movies. Even now at age 16 I love the classics Toy story, Alladin, Hercukes etc. But the recent films are just terrible especially sequels. However I was thrilled when I saw pirates of the carribean. This is by far the best disney film I ever saw it is a definate buy you will want to watch again and again."
4,Johnny Depp,"There many actors in this movie yet, Johnny Depp you will watch over and over in his role of Captain Jack. You will not tired of watching this movie. Get your today."
4,Awesome,Best one of the pirate movies. Defiantly recommend. Good script and excellent cast. The director must of had high hopes for this film prior to shooting it
4,Great Movie!!,"This movie was very interesting to watch and kept my attention throuhout the whole thing!! I really enjoyed Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp's performances!I also loved that animation for the pirates and the monkey.I recommend this movie to all and I heard they are coming out with a sequel to this movie, which I can't wait to see!"
5,I forgot to add a coment that must not be forgotten!!,"This is a continuence of my last review, and I would just like to say that Captain Jack Sparrow is here to stay! Just like Indian Jones and James Bond and all those other characters, CJS is here to stay! I bet years later they will make books and whatnot out of this, so it will be passed down from generations, just like Peter Pan."
5,FANTASTIC!!,This movie was awesome. I loved Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. The plot was just the right balance of scary and romance. I highly recommend it.
2,Johnny Depp Rules,"Everything about this film reeks of Hollywood. Kiera Knightley always has makeup after getting drowned or punched or something that would usually inflict makeup. Depp is very good, gives it an extra star. The rest is bulls**t, and I would rather bash my head repeatedly on a car bonnet."
1,Boring and overrated!,"If you like overacting, you might enjoy Depp' performance. Otherwise, the film is a bore, with so many cliches."
1,Terrible,"Not too long ago I got excited when this film was released onto DVD. I went to the video store rented it and took it home. What a load of over hyped rubbish. There seemed to be no real story line, the action did not excite me, Orlando Bloom was a bit wooden, and the amount of times they went back and fourth from that dam island. I wanted to say good things but, i just can't. the only reason it got the 1 star was for Depps good, but not great performance."
2,PIRATES of the CARIBEEN,"I played the afored mentioned disc about 1/2 way at which time it started picture freezing, rather than keep on playing the disc (probably damaging my recorder ) I stopped it and wrote to lucyladyc (seller) . Told me to send it back and she would send me another copy. Wrote back telling me I BOUGHT USED,I reralize this but didn't think that used and unable to view meant the same thing"
3,"Other than Johnny Depp, the movie is really not that good.","Decent but boring effort made special by the winning Performance of Johnny Depp, who really deserves the nomination he got because the movie is one huge bore .See it for Johnny but other than him, don't bother."
2,Not The Best,All of these Pirates of the Caribean movies are gross. The first film shows not only pirates but ugly rotton skeletal figures representing pirates. The captain of one ship drinks some rum and the liquid just drips through his skeleton.All of the films are too long also. The second film shows Captain Jack Sparrow holding a thumping human heart. The first one and all of them have some language in them. The violence isn't graphic but it has a little humor in it. There's some humor in the films but the stories aren't too enjoyable. Some violence is way too long. I don't like the movies.
3,Hokey.,"This movie has cool concepts, but it had an equal amount of cheese and the quality of the writing reminded me of a few poorly-written vampire movies.I liked a lot of the action scenes though, despite the fact that Johnny Depp plays the same character in the majority of his movies-(and if you deny that, count how many times he twitches in this, how many times he twitches in Secret Window, how many times he twitches in the M. Night Shyamalon documentary, and all of his other twitchy movies...you will find that the number of twitches in each one is divisible by 3)-so I suppose 3/5"
4,"Mr. Depp, your table is waiting","I first saw this 12-02-03 on DVD. Johnny Depp was terrific, as were the action scenes.My first reaction to Depp was, ""he sounds like Keith Richards!"" This response was echoed by the amazon.com reviewer.My only complaint is that it is a little too long. Take a break at the 1.5 hour mark, and get some snacks."
4,A Great Movie,This is a great movie of 2003 it is the only good pirate movie.It was so good Johnny Depp was nominated for best actor but lost to Sean Penn.This was not the only good movie of 2003 there were alot other exelent films in 03.A few examples are X2 Xmen united Finding Nemo Terminator 3 rise of the MachinesMysic river Lost in traslation and at last movie is the Best picture oscar winnerof the year the number 1 film of 2003 criticly and financialy and the winner is..................................................................................................The Lord of the Rings The Return of The King
2,Stupid crap.,"The plot: There's not much of one, just a bunch of pirates swinging swords and yelling things like ""Ay, Me Matey!""My opinion: This movie is a must miss. Similar to other crap shows based off of freakin' rides, like the Haunted Mansion, or The country Bears, this movie sucks. There is nothing good about it, not even remotely.The Overall: The acting, diecting etc. wasn't bad, but nothing can save this tragedy.DVD: Not as good as it could have been.conclusion: Not that good, actually."
1,Arrgh Its' boring,"Maybe I can't stand pirate movies, maybe I cant' stand Disney films minus the Pixar name, maybe its' just this movie was boring for me. I cared nothing for any character or plot. The visuals were nice and Johnny Depp provided some amusement but overall he wasn't enough. Did anyone notice that the movie is set in the Caribbean and there are about 3 black people in the movie. Gee maybe asking for a smidgen of realism is too much, but dang guys its the West Indies. I just hated this film."
1,Worst piece of trash ever.,Simply the worst movie ever made. It's Johnny Depp selling out wearing eyeliner and dressing like a silly pirate for 143 minutes.
1,Typical Disney work,"I love pirates and tales of adventure, so I was looking forward to watching this movie. But it turns out, unfortunately, that this is a typical Disney movie, with the typical Disney humor. Complete with the two stupid bad guys, the dumb British old guy plus (new & improved!) the dumb British young guy, flawlessly beautiful, haughty heroine, and Orlando Bloom as the hero. I couldn't help laughing aloud to see that scrawny Bloom playing the part of a blacksmith's apprentice - ! The fact that the heroine gets stranded on a deserted island with a drunk pirate captain and presumably manages to avoid being raped also bothered me. It seems to me that the movie makers were most interested in the horror aspect of the film, which was interesting but totally sensational and, I thought, redundant.Johnny Depp's performance was great, of course, but it couldn't save the movie. The soundtrack is very enjoyable. I'd rather listen to it than watch the movie."
1,Horrible,"This movie is just plane horrible. The sea battles are fake, the costumes are cheap, and the actual 'sailing' is just plain wrong. If your looking for a good sailing action adventure movie then buy Master and Commander. This movie is ok for kids because there gullable or just don't no better. Thos movie is just plain STUPID from an adult point of view"
3,sad treatment for jack,"I did like the humor in this but i really did not like the way the horrid so called lovers treated jack. It really makes me dislike them, treating him like crap for their selfish gain when he lends a hand out. So many times jack should have sent what is coming to them for the horrable treatment he got. The so called hero in this movie the son of william the booteneer..i can understand being hard in the beginning but continuing his cruel sharade was just heartless. And his so called female companion a whiny, gripy wench who uses jack for what she wants and has no understanding or compassion. The graphics were good, the bad guys were cool, jack had a nice style on his own but he deserves more honor and respect than they ever gave him in this movie and the lack of it just leaves a bad bitter taste in my mouth. I wont buy this movie. I'm sorry Johnny Depp had to play such a underappricated and abused character."
3,A little too cutesy.,"The lead character is Captain Jack, a flamboyant tart of a man, who prances about like a back-up guitar player for an Aerosmith cover band.The special effects are fine, the costuming a bit cheesy. The female lead is as satisfying as a twinkie doused in Sweet-N-Low.The musical score is bland, the ""rollicking"" story reminds me of when I was four years old and first tasted paste.The villians, red coaated brits festooned with all the pagentry of flags and medals, is trite. And how DARE they try to stop pirates from raping and pillaging.Buy it for the kids, any 11 year old will enjoy the swashbuckling. If you are an adult with an IQ over 100, you are better of watching an Emmauelle movie..the acting is better."
5,Depp at his Best,"I LOVED this movie. This Depp's best performance ever and I strongly believe he should have won an Oscar. Orland Bloom teams up well with Depp as he does with Kira Knightly who looks amazing in this movie. There are to be at least 2 more ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies made and I can assure you I will be first in line to see them on the Big Screen and buy them on DVD."
4,Widescreen vs FullScreen,"To the reviewer who was complaining about Pirates of the Carribean being ""widescreen"" and not ""fullscreen""1) If you had a widescreen TV it would almost fill the whole screen (2.35:1 aspect ratio is a little wider than 1.78:1)2) If you have a 4:3 TV, the fullscreen version would chop so much off in order to make it fit, you would miss a lot of the action.3) People want ""widescreen"" movies. In a few years - widescreen TV's will be in the majority. Those of us who have purchased widescreen movies - won't have to buy our video collection all over again."
5,Cool,The visuals go great on the PSP. I love the visuality of the clearness of the PSP. I can't wait. REally want this
5,My Son Loves It,"I purchased this, along wth all of the other available Pirates of the Caribbean movies for my son's birthday. He loves pirates and had seen these movies and asked for them. He loves every moment of this movie and would make you watch it a million times over. I would definitely reccommend this to others."
5,Love them,I love this move I need to get the third one. So if you can let me know I would be greatful thank you
5,Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl,I love this movie and am very happy to own it at last. It is great.
5,Great Depp,"This could be the best pirate movie ever made. Why? Not only it has created two sequels (the third one is not out yet) but there are loyal funs of the series and it has made DisneyWorld convert their pirate ride into a Johnny Dep inspired ride.The movie itself is benefited by a superb plot, great visual effects and great acting. What is even more important the actors seem to actually enjot themselves and they do not take thamselves too seriously which adds to our entertainment. And lastly: Johnny Depp. If you were not a fan of his until now, you will became. His best perfomance until today. He makes the movie even better.Buy it and enjoy it."
5,POCkies,"My daughter is actually the POC fan of the family and these were purchased for her. But I enjoyed these discs tremendously! After seeing the extra footage and the making of the movie DVD I really understand how much effort, cost and time goes into one of these films. It made me feel good about paying for this set of DVD's."
5,"I thought it would be interesting, I was totally wrong!","I saw the preview on the Disney Channel about 4 months before it came out and I thought it looked pretty interesting, so I decided I would go see it when it came out. Well I was totally wrong!! It wasn't interesting it was amazing, cativating, fantastic, it pulls you along in the adventure. The music, the scenes, the fights, its all beyond your wildest dreams!! When you come out of this film you will never forget what you saw, and you will be wanting to come back again and again. And trust me you will, I've seen it 5 times and I have never gotten tired of it. The details are so rich you notice something new every time you see it. So I highly recommend this wonderful film!!"
5,Excellent Extras,You will not be disappointed! Tons of interesting extras and they did not neglect to put that Play All feature in.
5,Pirates of the Caribbean Review,"I really like this movie a lot. It really inspired me a lot. i really like the ride in Disney World and loved it. The movie is just as good. Johnny Depp makes the movie funny and even better. Orlando Bloom is so cute. This movie is funny, scary in parts, and fun. It is well worth your time to go out and see it. Go and see Pirates of the Caribbean honestly. You will love it. It is now my favorite movie. I have seen it 2 times but i will see it 10 times more!!!!!! This is a must see movie. I bet it will get most watched movie of the year. You will love it. This is the best movie ever. I plan on buying it when it comes out to order.SEE IT!!!!!!!!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"I loved this movie,and I'm actually pretty picky about what i think of the movies I see. But Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are awesome! The skeleton Pirates were so cool it's like a thrill ride. I took my eight year old brother to see this movie, I honestly thought it would be to scary for him, but he (and my dad) loved it! This movie seriously made being a pirate seem like the most fun ever!! If you haven't seen it you really really should!!"
4,Excellent! Disney Strikes Again!,"Probally my second favorite film of the summer, this action-filled movie might be one of Disney's greatest, and that's the hard thing to belive, that Disney made this. I wouldn't take your cartoon-loving four-year-old to this; he or she would freak out after the first half-hour. And don't be scared about the zombie pirates. They're nowhere near scary (Alritght, they're a BIT scary, but I wouldn't make this a horror movie for them) It has an excellent, thick running plot and super charecters, not to mention the villain, Barabosa, who is one of the greatest movie villains of the summer. Last but not least, it has great special effects, like when two fighting zombies are rolling through the moonlight, they flash from skeletal to normal. SEE THIS!!"
5,PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN,Excellent! They keep you guessing all the way. Johnny Depp is fantastic as Jack Sparrow. I just became his biggest fan! I will go see this movie again.
5,Great movie!,"I saw this movie yesturday (opening day) and it was awesome. This a great movie. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow was a great choice. Orlando Bloom was awesome, so was Rush. The soundtrack is terrific! This is a great pirate movie. Everyone should see it."
5,Johnny Depp was Incredible,"No I wasn't kidding, Johnny Depp was incredible. Captain Jack Sparrow's mannerisms are funny, and Depp does an excellent job of displaying them. No one actually knows why Sparrow acts so funny, but he is sort of the hero who is bad and only looks out for himself, but in the end ends up look out for others also.Orlando Bloom portrayed an average hero in love and that only, but he still does a great job. It was interesting to see him not as an elf in Lord of the Rings. Going in I was thinking I would be always thinking of him as Legolas, but he did such a good job that it never crossed my mind.Although the plot was never displayed that much in the previews, the plot ended up being great and kept me on the edge of my seat. The Black Pearl pirates were great, the effects were outstanding.Overall this is a movie everyone must check out because of the extraordinary effects, acting, and plot."
5,It's About Time,I am very happy to see a really good summer movie. This movie is original and amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good times!!! WAy to Go Disney! Home Run!!
5,The best movie of the year!,"Pirates of the Caribbean is my all time fav. movie! Johnny Depp is amazing! For any one who likes a bit of everything in a movie, I highly reccomend this!"
4,ONE OF DISNEY'S FINEST,"Well, Disney Studios finally got one right. It seems they've been trying to make movies of some of their attractions in their theme parks (Country Bears and the upcoming Haunted Mansion). I was a little wary after Country Bears wasn't all I'd thought it'd be. Was I wrong? Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is in search of a vessel to get his beloved Black Pearl back from Captain Barbosa, the man who left him to die on a deserted island years before. Helping Captain Jack in his quest is Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly. As Captain Barbosa sets out to reverse the curse that has beset him and his crew, Captain Jack is looking to re-capture his Black Pearl and the movie really takes off. The special effects are excellent and even though it's a Disney film, keep mind of the PG-13 rating."
5,Great movie!!,"I love Johnny in this movie. He is brilliant in this movie. I didn't really understand and never will why he didn't won an Oscar for that role.Orlando and Keira are also very good. This movie has everything: action, comedy, love....."
5,Pirates of the Caribbean- The Curse of the Black Pearl,Great Movie. Johnny Depp is magnificently funny as Captain Jack Sparrow! Orlando Bloom rocks as Will Turner. Loved it!Bobby
5,Pirates are interesting,"This is a seriously funny, and very fun, movie. I have never ridden the ride, but the movie is a blast. Johnny Depp is a comic actor of force and his stage presence is incredible. Every scene he is in is marvelous. The ingenue is gorgeous and the action is fast, furious and believable. For there to be humor I was told by a teacher long ago there must be believable risk, and you must care about what happens to the characters. I do not remember why he said it, but I think it is true.One of the best parts of the movie is the sword play. These people have been to school. The sword fights do not look like creative camera work, they looks real. I wonder how long it takes to learn to fence?The characters are not cardboard in the end. They all grow and believably change as a result of the action. It is a wonderful flic and I cannot recommend it more highly"
4,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When I first went to see this movie I thought It was gonna be a little kid movie but boy was I in for a treat. It was an action adventure thing. The pirates looked real. When you start to watch this movie you wont wanna get up until you see the whole movie.; When you watch you feel like you are there with them. Great movie.
4,Great fun in a forgotten genre,"Frankly, I was surprised how much I liked this movie. What a throwback to the days of Flynn and Fairbanks! The pace is swift and seems effortless. The characterizations are a wonderful blend of light-comedy and earnest genre work. Depp and Rush keep the mood light enough so the other principles can play it mostly straight. At times it really reminded me of ""The Princess Bride"" in its style and feel - witty but well-made.The film does run a bit too long, not that it can't sustain the humor and action, but parts seem extraneous. A leaner film would have been better."
5,"Wowie, wow, wow!","Alright, I'll admit it, I ONLY saw the movie for the infamous Johnny Depp, I've been a fan of his since 21 Jump Street and I'm not stopping now! Ok, I first thought, &quot;what? Now Disney's run out of idea's so they have to make movies of their rides now?! what's the deal?&quot; But I'm happy to admit that this venture of theirs was well worth it. The movie is just amazing. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom have this great chemistry about themselves that make this grand adventure of theirs totally believable, and Geoffery Rush is just great as the opposing enemy. But, if all that great acting and comedy doesn't get you, the action sequences and special effects will. The computer animation in this movie is flawless! The transitions from the moonlight to non light are absolutely beautifully done. This movie is just a great watch for anyone, and will make anyone apreciate the talent known as Johnny Depp even more!"
4,Take your kids! Take your parents! See this movie!,"Depp is brilliant, as always. But, this movie would stand out without him. It is a fantastic tribute to the Disney ride, and a rip roarin', good story! The casting, acting, scenery and effects, are all well worth the ticket price. Note: I would not recommend this movie for very small children."
4,Johnny Depp Impressive,"I am old enough to remember Johnny Depp on tv. He has certainly grown as an actor, his SAG win for this role proving that. Plus, he's gotten even better looking. Okay, to be honest, I could have just sat there and looked at him and Orlando Bloom for a couple of hours. The fact that they can both act is a big bonus, though.Disney is to be congratulated on doing an unexpectedly fine job with the script and production. I guess they're not just about animation and theme parks after all."
5,Pirates of the Caribbean,"This has to be one of the best movies to come out in many years. They have proven that a truly awesome movie can be made without any sex, drugs or rock and roll. It's a movie for any age or gender...and there's not very many of those out there. Johnny Depp is at his best. He deserves an Oscar for this performance. A movie you wish would never end! Please say there's more to come!!"
5,Pirates,"What can I say ... I love Pirates! Arrrrrrrr I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves to watch action, comedy and just have a fun time."
4,My kids love these movies,I purchased this movie for my sons. They now have the complete collection of the Pirates of the Caribbean. They both love this movie.
3,"Reference Quality Video and Audio, Great Film","Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is an excellent film. I cannot say I am a fan of all the films in the Pirates series, but this is a good one.I don't get Johnny Depp's character too much.This film has great scenery - the film was shot in Dominica."
4,Pirates Of the Carribean!!,"...Wow!, This was a great movie! A couple of weeks ago it came out and I was hesitant to go see it, because it didn't look like ""my kind of movie"", and the teaser trailer looked kind of stupid. But when I finally went to see the movie It turned out to be great! First of all, Johnny Depp did a great acting job as ""Cap'n Jack Sparrow"", and Orlando Bloom also did great. If you don't go see it because of the plot, see it because of Johnny Depp's performance. I advise you give this movie a chance, and I'm sure you will love this great movie.Cheers, ""Yaaaaaar"""
4,Pirates,"I hate the disney ride. That said, this movie looked horrible based on the trailers. I still went to see it because I'm a big fan of Johnny's acting (he is always very into his roles and very convincing). The movie was great. It fit into the mold of pirates being treasure hungery and most drinking and having no love for government. That wasn't a problem though because its what we all grew up knowing pirates to be."
5,We've watched it 6 times!,Not sure what I can say others haven't except we've watched it 6 times! That's how good it is... worth buying
3,Scratched DVD!!!!!!,"On Christmas I gave my children this DVD. We started watching it and towards the end it got faulty. We took the DVD out and inspected it. We saw a big scratch!!! We didn't get to watch part of the movie, we were very upset and mad!!!"
4,Great Movie!,"I saw Pirates of the Caribbean in the theater and it was amazing! The DVD is even better because you get to see all of the behind-the-scenes Special Features. I do note that at 1 hour and 17 minutes there is a glitch in the DVD where the layers are switching over, so I cannot give the DVD technology more than 4 stars, but I recommend that everyone buy this DVD; it is a splendid tale!"
1,I Pray For You All,This is one of the absolute worst films I have ever seen. Gore Verbinski has never made a good movie. Johnny Depp (who is one of my all time favorite actors) gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen. How could this film make as much money as it did? And why is Depp nominated for a best actor oscar? What is wrong with the world that so many people got sucked into this bloated mess? I can't believe how awful this film truly is...Embarassing in so many ways. The only good thing in the film is when it ends...Then its finally over.
5,Pirates of the Caribbean,"""Pirates of the Caribbean"" will be the best movie in the summer of 2003. Since the actor Orlando Bloom is going to have a big performance on this movie then it will be brilliant! Orlando Bloom did a wonderful job on acting as Legolas the elf in ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is going to be a brilliant movie because of all the action, adventure, excitment, and fun it will have to offer. I am very excited and cannot wait to see this highly anticipated movie!"
1,Kids stuff,"If you're into family movies than this one will probably be in your top 5 favorite. When I first saw the preview for it it was definitely at the top of my must-see list, that was until I heard it was being made by Disney. Disney movies are known to be PG-rated, although this is rated PG-13 it still seems like a PG movie with all the ""family-fun humor"" in it. Personally I'm not into these type movies to be honest because I like guy stuff and this is kiddy crap, that's why I give it one star. So guys, be a man and don't buy this kids stuff."
3,Depp Excels,"Worth seeing for the wacky over-the-top performance of Johnny Depp, but let down a bit by the script. These are the same guys who wrote ""Shrek"" and ""POTC"" doesn't really quite rach the level of that one. They also have strange ideas about floatability. A boat full of air is not going to stay at the bottom of the ocean and young ladies do not sink like a stone.Still, averagely enjoyable. Ham acting rules."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER!!! JOHNNY DEPP WAS GREAT!,THis movie was the best movie ever Johnny Depp and orlando bloom were a hoot together!! If anyone said it stunk they are nuts!! it was the best film johnny Depp has bin in! I cant believe how Gore Verbinski and jerry Buckhimer pulled it off! It was GREAT my compliments!
2,ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL!!!!,"I truly enjoyed the movie in the theater. So when the dvd came out I was sure to purchase it. However, I am truly DISAPPOINTED because it does not provide the option of FULL SCREEN only wide screen so when I was watching it at home, most of the heads, parts in different scenes, etc. were cut off. At least they can give you an option in the setup if they don't provide a full screen dvd. All these technical guru's should know that when it comes to televisions ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL!!!!!!"
3,Enhanced computer features do NOT work on MACs,"Great movie. The enhanced computer features do NOT work on Apple Macintosh computers (or with Virtual PC). Disney does not print this fact anywhere on the DVD package or insert, nor do they state it on their website. You'll have to insert the DVD into your Mac and and open the Read Me file to locate this information."
2,A fair movie at best,"While special effects and fabulous sets often cover a world of sins in moviemaking, they don't cover this film all that well. I found the script vapid and Depp's staggeringly unsympathetic performance to be lackluster.Without having taken a sip of alcohol, I found myself falling asleep between musings about when this film was going to make some sense, or at least measure up to its considerable hype. I ordinarily enjoy this type of film but found this one boring. Maybe it's the easily-amused nature of many in today's viewing audiences that made them enjoy this film. If you are easily satisfied, enjoy this movie. If you are more discriminating, pass."
1,One of the worst films! 24th june 2004.,"Okay, everyone has there own opinion but how it looks is basically what it is like. All pirate fighting mainly, not my type extremely boring! Everyone thinks it is ace but me, not."
1,"Please be careful letting kids watch ""Pirates""","I know a family whose 12 year old son died playing ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Watch it and enjoy it, but make sure your kids know that playing with ropes is NEVER okay. Accidents happen and the consequences are forever."
1,Not Spanish Language & Subtitles !!!,It is really a shame that there are no language or subtitles for this amazing movie.I'll have to wait until a version on another zone in order to have it and share it with my family.
1,Pirates of the Caribbean,"My husband and I, senior citizens, both hated this movie. My daughter begged me to get it and thought we would enjoy it. Why, I will never know. It is strange to say the least and so unbelievable. Nothing like the title would lead you to believe. People changing from humans to skeletons and back again is not my cup of tea. Give me John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara any time and you can keep Depp."
1,Misframed for 10 min,About 9 or 10 min of this film is framed incorrectly. The sequence in question is the sword fight between Jack Sparrow and Will Turner in the blacksmith's shop. The image is shifted down so at some points the actors are actually delivering dialog with their heads cut off. I would avoid ordering this title until Disney issues a corrected version.
4,Saves The Pirate Genre?,"Fast paced fun film that may have saved the Pirate genre? This film proves again what an underated actor Johnny Depp is. Remember ""Donnie Brasco?"" He made Captain Jack Sparrow into a hilarious, heroic figure. Fine action, witty dialogue, & good period costumes made it highly enjoyable. Keira Knightly was perfect & breathtakingly beautiful as Elizabeth Swann. Geoffrey Rush & Orlando Bloom as Captain Barbarossa & Will Turner respectively were also perfectly cast. Miss Swann is kidnapped by Barbarossa, & Turner & Jack go after the Black Pearl to rescue her. They soon find out that these pirates are not ordinary. They are cursed to remain between the world of the living & the dead.They all look like skelotons when basked in the moonlight. The only cure for them is ""Elizabeth's blood."" Jack & Will are faced with a race against time & battle the undead to save the governor's {Jonathan Pryce} daughter. A very fun movie for all ages."
1,Not bad if you don't mind having your remote control disabled for 13 minutes!,"I bought this disc (Blu-Ray) because of all the positive reviews I've read about both the movie, and the Blu-Ray rendering.All that is true - great movie, awesome visuals, fantastic sound. But I give it a ONE STAR rating for the following reason:YOU HAVE TO SIT THROUGH 13 MINUTES OF NON-BYPASSABLE MOVIE PREVIEWS EVERY TIME YOU LOAD THE DISC OR PRESS ""STOP"" ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL.Folks, this is ridiculous. Do you like seeing a circle with a bar when you try to press ""Menu"", and have to sit through 13 minutes of movie previews, every time you load a Blue-Ray disc you paid $25.00 for, every time you load it in your Blu-Ray player or press ""Stop""?No!I am not buying another Disney movie, ever. Period. People shouldn't have to put up with this."
5,"Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me! Blu-ray review!","The first in the Pirates trilogy and it's a swashbuckling romp. Johnny Depp is amazing in his role as the conniving Captain Jack Sparrow. The special effects are amazing and draw you into the story as the curse is revealed in moonlight. The story is rich and the acting from all, outstanding. It's a fun adventure that you can watch over and over again!NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: ABSOLUTE WOW!!! The best transfer possible. Amazing clarity and color. The image pops off the screen. The sound is amazing and pounding. As for the extras...all from the dvd release and more! Interactive menus that will blow you away. FINAL VERDICT: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? THIS IS THE BLURAY TO OWN! DEMO DISC!!! GET IT!"
3,A Swashbuckling Bore,"I thought the first forty-five minutes were very cleverly written, and Johnny Depp is inarguably a scene-stealer in this film. But the cumbersome plot turns absurd, and as soon as all the characters' energies onscreen are diverted toward the task of lifting an ancient curse (culminating in a set of dreary sea battles and chases), I lost interest. Honestly, Depp is probably what made the last half of this overly long film bearable for me.I am disappointed that Disney released such a violent movie in such kid-friendly packaging. There are a lot of callous murders of innocent townspeople here. And to put so much work into producing a film that glamorizes pirates--a word that has little meaning outside of rape, murder, robbery, and destruction--is a questionable endeavor. Think twice before you let your kids watch this one, unless they're already desensitized little bloodlusters."
5,BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD,"Every movie that i like is the best movie in the world, BUT THIS Is the best movie in the world!"
2,Wide Screen Only,"After seeing the movie Pirates of the Caribbean in a movie theater I vowed to purchase it on DVD as soon as it was released. The big day came and I was one of the first in line to buy the new DVD. Problem was it was only available in wide screen format. Apparently I am still probably one of the only individuals in the US with a regular TV set, not a wide screen. I purchased the DVD anyway despite the annoying black lines on the top and bottom of my TV. The movie was so much fun that I was willing to watch it on my 32 inch screen even if it ment I could only view a 12 inch strip of it accross my regular TV. Problem was when I tried playing the bonus features on my computer. Even though I have a new computer with Windows XP, I still couldn't access the virtual features on the DVD. Conclusion: I'm highly dissapointed that such a wonderful film was marketed in such an awkward format."
1,"Over-rated, campy, let down.","Wallace Barry has nothing to worry about. For younger childrenthis might hit a bell. Considering the retail price, we recommendpassing this one by."
3,"Excellent Movie, Excellent Extras, Disappointing Overall","I love this movie when I saw it in the theaters this summer. I couldn't wait fot he DVD to come out. When I finally got the DVD, I watched all the extras and this DVD is jam packed with extras. They say there's over 10 hours of extra stuff. I'm not sure that it's quite that much (several items are repeated, especially historical commentary), but it definitely was interesting and plentiful.My biggest disappointment though, was the DVD version of the movie. IT WAS NOT WHAT I SAW IN THE THEATERS!!! Quite a few of the scenes were shortened! Most of the shortened scenes were included on the DVD in the Deleted & Extended scenes section, but I wanted to see the version that I saw in the theaters. My wife and I were both very disappointed in this little trick.Maybe the version we saw in the theaters was eventually shortened later in it's run. I saw the movie the week after it came out. But that still doesn't excuse the fact that the DVD was also cut."
2,This ship is foundering!,"One of the silliest movies I have seen in awhile! An absolute waste of talent. Some of the special effects are interesting, but no movie should be based on that alone. The story is so confusing and contrived that I was bored with it half-way through and could barely keep my eyes open. Therefore, only two stars for this mish-mash of a movie."
2,NOPE THE PIRATES LIFE IS NOT FOR ME,"The movie had good effects, there right the skeleton thing was cheesy.Had its entertainment, but i think the lady actor in the movie made it stupid. The whole thing of her being nice english girl and then ordering pirates to fight back. nah I only saw this movie because johnny depp is one of my favorite actors."
2,Was Only OK,The reason I didnt like this movie that much was that I couldnt stand looking at Johnny Depp. He looked like a woman with the black makeup around the eyes. I did not want to see a mannish woman jumping around
2,Medicore summer blockbuster,"I must say I was very disappointed in this film. I was expecting a fairly exciting and intense action film with some good laughs and quirky characters.Instead I got medicore action scenes, barely giggles, and cardbored, forgettable characters. What really amazed me was that this movie had no centerpiece action sequence. There really wasn't a single action scene to remember the movie by, or a memorable moment period for that matter.This film is barely worth a rental, and definitely not worth a purchase."
1,"Poorly designed, doesn't allow pause and resume","The movie itself is great and looks great. The problem is, say you pause this for a few minutes and come back to it or turn off your player and want to watch from where you left off, well you can't without spending 5 minutes getting through about 500 previews and warnings. It's a long movie, and unless you plan to sit through the entire thing in one sitting, don't bother. No bathroom breaks either!Disney has blown it with how they designed this disc. All my other Blu-rays work as they should. My DVD player 9 years ago picked up where movies left off after pausing or stopping."
1,Buyer beware! Heads lopped off!,"There is a serious framing problem for 9 minutes of the movie, where the frame is lower than it should be. So you will be looking at groins and torsos instead of full faces."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"I went to see the movie because it got great reviews from all of my friends, not because I liked the Disney ride. I truly found this movie to be a wonderful movie experience in which I felt right in the action. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Kiera Knightly were splendid, the action surreal, and the plot superb. I never thought once about the end of the movie. I was captivated and enthralled the whole way through from the first second to the ending credits. This movie not only got better than five stars, but Pirates of the Caribbean made me like the Disney ride!"
5,Love this movie!! FUN!!,"This is a great movie! Excellent cast, funny script, great adventures, scary special effects! 5*S*T*A*R*S!"
5,scott mitchell is un-informed about widescreen.,"don't go by what mitchell says. this movie needs to be seen in widescreen to fully take in the scope and the atmosphere of this beautifully filmed movie.Depp is a riot.""your the worst pirate i ever heard of.""""but you heard of me."""
3,Not as good as expected,"Since this movie did so well at the theaters, we decided to wait to see it, until it came out on DVD and purchase it. We felt it was possibly a movie we would want to watch over and over. That was not the case. The movie lacked a good story plot. We love Johnny Depp, but he was way to feminine and cowardly. He was not the sexy, brave, hero type we were expecting. We thought he would be the leading man. The love interest of the female co-star. He wasn't really the star of the movie."
1,Movie does not work,"Disk passed physical inspection, but movie does not work, it got stuck and then it jumps from one scene to another.I tried it on multiple BD players."
4,Very Good Service,Customer service was great as the disc did not play properly and a replacement product was shipped quickly. Thanks Amazon.
5,Pirates of the Caribbean-The Curse of the Black Pearl,"Johnnie Depp is excellent in this film as he is in the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Fun to watch, excellent story line. If you are a Johnnie Depp fan please don't miss this one..."
5,Pirates of the Caribbean Rocks!,"Excellent movie that takes full advantage of the PSP screen abilities. The picture is flawless and gives you an idea of the massive amounts of colors the screen can produce. Not only that, but the audio comes through as clear as can be. After purchasing this movie, I actually ended up purchasing another copy for my friend because this was such an awesome edition to my collection!I Recommend you get this movie!"
5,POTC ROCKS!!!,POTC Rocks!! it is the best movie since sliced bread and will continue to be untill sliced jelly ( try and do that huh ). No but we are sirius..i mean serious. This movie is awesomely awesome ( DA BOMB! ) GO POTC!! WE LOVE YOU NANAFrom us here reporting to you live from ...well....our school.Bye
5,AWESOME,"This movie was by far the best I have seen in a long time. It had everything...action, adventure, fantasy, and some romance (but not so much that guys won't like it, lol). There are sword fights, a curse...and the coolest special effects. The costumes, the music, the acting were all great...it is all there...a great package. It has been a long time since I have walked out of a theater this pumped up over a film. I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD so I can own it. Johnny Depp, by the way, is SO fabulous in this film...he has such a great look to him, his movements are so cool, and his accent is wonderful.I highly recommend this film to anyone seeking a good adventure next time they are at the movies."
5,Pirates of The Caribbean-Best Movie EVER!!!,"Pirates of the Caribbean was THE BEST movie i have probably EVER seen, and I don't even LIKE action movies or pirate movies or whatever! I LOVED that movie! Putting Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom and whoever played Elizabeth was an awesome idea! They worked together SO WELL!!!! It also helps that Orando Bloom and Johnny Depp were downright SEXY in this movie(unlike lord of the rings no offense orlando but blonde is not good for you) We need a sequel! Plus the graphics were WONDERFUL!!"
3,Johnny Depp saved this movie,"Some cast members are great and well-cast, but Depp is on another level. One of the best performances ever."
4,The First and the Best,"I'm amazed that Hollywood finally made a decent pirate movie.When I was a kid, SWASHBUCKLER (1976) was a major disaster. Robert Shaw, riding high after the biggest summer blockbuster ever, JAWS, starred in a pirate movie that killed any hope of this genre setting sea ever again. I can't remember when Roman Polanski directed PIRATES but it also sank into the abyss.When I'd heard that a movie was coming out based on the Disney ride...I had doubts. But then Johnny Depp was starring, so I figured there would have to be something interesting to attract him.It's a fun summer movie. The story is constructed like an amusement park ride, more for effect than any real thought. The special effects are top-notch and there's enough humor to keep things sailing along."
5,Great movie,"This is one of those few hollywood blockbusters that actually deserves all of the attention it gets. Johnny Depp is great as Jack Sparrow, you never know what he's gonna do next. However, my favorite character in the movie was definitely Barbossa, played by Geoffrey Rush, what a character! The set-work is great and the visual effects are very good although you can really see the computer working those skeletons. But who cares! It's a very entertaining movie that's very funny, got some good action, and best of all a really engaging soundtrack that really propels the movie forward. I'd recommend this for children and adults as the humor can be shared by both. All in all, a very light-hearted movie with plenty of plot twists and action to keep you interested."
5,You Would Be a Cursed Pirate NOT to Buy This DVD,"One word: AMAZING! This movie is one of the greatest films ever! It revives the swashbuckling pirate adventure flim genre where the last good films of this genre were made decades ago with the likes of Errol Flynn. There is a little bit of everything for just about anyone...action, adventure, romance, awesome digital effects, etc. As I sit in my dorm room, longing for finals to be over, I think about the time when they will all be over and I will be able to watch this awesome DVD during winter break!....this DVD is totally worth it. Do not be disinclined to acquiesce to my request....buy the DVD, savvy?"
5,Swashbuckling fun,"I was skeptical when I first heard that Disney was making a movie based on the Pirates of Caribbean ride in Disney. However, this series has exceeded all expectations. It's a funny, swashbuckling adventure. The plot is basically an excuse to give the pirates as much screentime as possible, but it works well enough and has enough suspense to keep viewers entertained. Johnny Depp really carries the movies as Captain Jack Sparrow, the witty, amoral pirate captain. Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly are also good, and the supporting actors (including the monkey) have some funny scenes. This movie is easily the best of the three. This is why popcorn was invented!"
4,"Okay, but ride is better!!","I think that this movie is okay, but not as good as the ride at DisneyWorld. I enjoyed watching Johnny Depp as a hilarious pirate, but Orlando Bloom is not the best actor in the world and therefore the movie was not as good as it could be. Some of the dvd extras were really good. And yes it did remind me of the ride, but it just wasn't all that I thought it would be. Maybe it was because I don't really like Orlando Bloom or action movies are not my favorite type of movies to watch."
4,Wonderful Stuff.....,"I saw this movie on VHS, and I loved it. Wonderful stuff, the whole thing. I usually don't go for disney movies, but this one was a nice treat. Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, Barbossa's character,(can't remember his name) and just about everyone in this film was great."
4,Performances are over the top!!!!!!,"I have seen this movie twice and found it even funnier the second time around. I am sure that had to do with the fact that the first time, I didn't realize Jack Sparrow's character was based loosely on Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones. Johnny Depp does an amazing job. I think because of his good looks, no one gives him the credit he deserves as an actor. He's so smooth in this. He didn't even have to speak to make the film funny. He was Jack Sparrow. Should he get the oscar? It's hard to say because I haven't seen the other movies to compare. He should definetely get acknowledged in some way because his take on Jack Sparrow and his acting, were phenonmenal. On another note, the filming was incredible. It was such a beautiful mood piece. It took you back to another time and place. Coming from Disney, I was impressed. Very enjoyable."
5,A Disney Delight,"Who would have known that Disney could step past the world of animation so well? Though they have put out many ""real"" films before, none can possibly compare to this particular piece of art. A tad bit roguish, with just a dash of vulgarity, yet a simple classic tale make this the best pirate movie to ever appear on the market, despite the doubts that a pirate movie could ever amount to anything. Johnny Depp leads the cast, of course, with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley making stunning performances as well. After seeing this movie in the theater, I rented it the day it came out and bought it a mere week later. Great fun and entertainment, no matter what age or genre."
5,Great movie!,"I LOVE Pirates of the Carribean! It is a great movie. As soon as I saw it I knew I needed to own it. At first I wasn't really sure how they were going to make a movie from a ride at Disney World. I have been on that ride and I really had some doubts. But I saw it anyway and I'm so glad I did. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are great together. Johnny is histerical and Orlando is just extremely good looking! I absolutely recommend this movie. I'm not really sure if your going to want to watch it with very young children though. Keep in mind that the pirates on the Black Pearl are cursed. Some of the scenes when they are ghosts might scare the little ones. But anyway, this is a great movie with a great cast. I suggest you watch it, right now!"
5,SHOULD BE A 5 OSCAR WINNER MOVIE,"I am very dispointed that Oscar is not selected by the American Audience. This movie puts you in the real pirate times, entertaining, and action. I would given more than 5 Oscars trophy for this movie. The performance of the actor are so excellent I really enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance. Very excellent character. You would see the time passing when you watch this movie. It's worth every penny you spend on this DVD."
5,Exquisite!,"What bad thing can I possibly say about this DVD.I saw it 3 times on cinema and 6 more the 2 times I rented it...It's the first movie that I actually saw 4 times in a row without falling asleep. It has a nice script, a nice background, a beautiful soundtrack and people who can actually act as they have lived in the 17th century for real. The movie of course is a pirate one but even if you don't like that type you're going to love it. I bought that movie imediately and that's what you should do too. I Hope you enjoy it."
4,"Ain't that right, Savvy?","I can't help but be a bit bias about this movie. A movie with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom is just so appealing to me, it hardly matters what the movie is about. But, even though I say that, I actually really did enjoy the plot. It was a bit cheesy, I can admit - especially when Elizabeth says ""You like pain? Try wearing a corset"". That was beyond corney. But you've got to take into account that this movie has to appeal to children as well as adults, as it is a children's movie. So I suppose corniness was just for the children's enjoyment. Other than that, this movie has it all: action, romance, humour, suspence and much more. And has the power to make you sit on the edge of your seat. Enjoy."
3,Too Long and Repetitive!,"I give this movie 3/5 because of its intensely repetitious nature. Jerry Bruckheimer's idea of a movie is apparently ""attempt to film a story, and when that fails, fight, fight, fight!""Other than that, the movie was okay. The inclusion of Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp was a plus, and the fighting was choreographed quite well. The plot could have used some work, as I mentioned already, which of course can't be blamed on Bruckheimer alone. The general idea, though, was a good one, and it's refreshing to see ""epic adventures"" like this one gaining popularity again."
5,caint wait to see a sequal,"i just reacently saw pirates of the caribbean and at first i was a bit sceptical but seeing as how the moovie theater was packed i could tell it was going to be a big hit! And it was trust me johny depp was an outstanding pirate the way he dressed the way he acted along with being a great comidean i especial liked the way his makeup was done along with orlando bloom can u say HOTT! as well as the charicters being perfect for the part the moovie itself was a great set up and very well done camera work. there was just enough action, thrill,surprises.comidy and horror as most pepole enjoy i dont think the moovie could of been any better or the actors who played in the moovie i can only hope to see that thre will be a sequal and mabey even one after that trust me it is the moovie of the summer! always lacey simpson"
4,Good Show,"I throughly enjoyed this movie. The special effects weren't over-done or too rediculous looking. In fact I think they're some of the best special effects I've seen in a while.Johnny Depp is outstanding. He plays his character well and is so charismatic in performance that you can't help to like him and see what he does next.Anyone who enjoys movies about Pirates, espcially good ones, this is a good movie to pick up and add to your collection.(Also, check out the comic book El Cazador, its along the same lines as this movie as far as pirates and so on.)"
3,Larceny,"Depp steals this movie. You cannot take your eyes off this audacious performance. Orlando who? Fun for all, including the older kids."
5,I miss pirate movies!,"With excellent backgrounds, acting, and storyline, this movie takes you to a completely different place. I did not see this in the theatres but recently rented the DVD, and I was still completely absorbed in the story. Johnny Depp does a fantastic job in his role. Another feel-good kind of movie with just the right amount of action and suspense! I can't wait to buy this!"
3,"Fun, but tiringly long","Johnny Depp brings an offbeat spin to his role, as usually. In this case, he seems to be channeling Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones, including the eyeliner and slightly slurred, inebriated speech. Most of the characters are flat and one dimensional- live action cartoons, really. The effects are outstanding, and kudos to Disney for making it creepy without being too visually disturbing for kids. This is the kind of movie that is amusing and entertaining but lacks a significant story arc, so it should have been kept to 80 or 90 minutes long. Therein lies my biggest gripe- this movie drones on for nearly 2 1/2 hours! Sheesh- even if it was rereleased as a ""directors cut"" with extra scenes restored, this movie should not exceed 1 hour 45 minutes. If they came out with a version about an hour shorter, I'd probably bump my review to from 3 up to 4 stars."
4,Popcorn Movie,"Pirates of the Caribbean was a surprisingly good movie considering it was based on a Disney theme park ride. The plot wasn't captivating as I'd hoped (clearly too predictable), but it was still entertaining.The best part of this movie was the extra DVD with bonus material that includes deleted scenes (some of them really should have been left in), bloopers, behind the scenes, diary of a ship (which I found incredibly fascinating), etc. But do yourself a favor and WATCH THE MOVIE BEFORE YOU WATCH THE BONUS MATERIAL, otherwise you'll be let down by the movie."
5,My favorite movie ever,"when I first saw this movie it just blew me away.The actors Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and the other actors were awsome.I've always wanted to be an actress and be as good as all the other great actors but it hasn't happend yet.That is what I think!!!P.S When is it going to be out on vhs and dvd?!"
1,"A Sinking, Stinking Turkey",I'll keep it simple. This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. Period. No redeeming values whatsoever.
1,Pure drivel,"This is one of the most intolerable films I've seen of late, though I guess I shouldn't be surprised given its origins as a theme park ride and the Bruckheimer/Disney connection. It just oozes badness. I can't think of one redeeming quality about it, even Depp, whom everyone said was the most entertaining part of the film. Instead he's the worst facets of his portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson melded with a rabies victim. The other performers are just as bad. The dialogue is horrific. It has every big blockbuster staple, even down to the screaming child alone in the street for some reason who is saved from a falling building at the last minute. Much of this movie I spent cringing. A waste of time, money, and human effort."
1,This was horrible,"It's one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Pirates of the Caribbean is very overrated. Curiosity will probably make you watch this movie anyway, and maybe you will enjoy it like the rest of the sheep! This movie is so bad I couldn't watch the whole thing."
1,silly and predictable,The plot was tediously boring and the acting was silly. Why would anyone model a pirate after keith richards? Never have I bought something based on so many positive amazon reviews and been so disapointed. This movie is pointless and stupid. More than anything else this movie is painfully predictable. My wife and I suffered through this inane movie assuming it would become entertaining at some point. All the while we sat and predicted exactly what was going to happen next. It was as predictable as the seasons. I want those 2 hours of my life back.
2,Let's Be Honest,"When this movie first came out I was pumped to see it. There was supposed to be evil pirates, Jack Sparrow has to stop them. The commercials blatantly lied. What we have instead is common criminal pirates who are cursed. All they freakin want is to get the curse lifted from them. What's so evil about that? Jack Sparrow runs around in circles and acts like a fruit, managing to get caught all the time. Nothing they said in the commercials was true. After watching it once at the movie theatre I don't think I could stand to watch it again.If you like Disney family fare, this is for you. If you believed the lieing commercials, you are in for a huge disappointment."
1,What a terrible movie,"Honestly, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Johny Depp is a pitiful actor, and he really shows it in this crap fest. I would rather poke my eyes out than ever see this garbage again. I think everyone should boycott this movie."
3,Probably Won't Be As Good As Hyped Up To Be,"I understand a lot of people feel this movie will be good because of the actors. What people don't understand is that just because there are good actors in a film, doesn't mean that the film will necessarily be good. I think that the movie has gained lots of hype partially due to the fact that Orlando Bloom is in it. Excuse me, but just because he may be attractive(I, personally, like men like Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean, big tough guys who don't run around and prance in forests), doesn't mean that this movie will be great. Just a warning, you may be disappointed."
5,This movie is a classic,"This movie is a classic, for children and adults alike. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow is delightfully wacky and awesome in every way. My 7 year old and I both loved this movie. Disney has certainly breathed new life into an oldie, but goodie."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"This is one of the best Disney productions I have seen in a long time! The casting was perfect, I can't imagine anyone else playing the roles. The storyline is great and I hope that there will be a sequal someday...the movie was incredible! I have seen it so many times I almost know the entire script by heart! Definetaly worth investing in this movie, it's one the whole family will love!"
5,Pirates of the Caribbean- The Curse of the Black Pearl,"I enjoy the movie, my daughter and I watched the movie so much that it was needing to be replaces."
4,The Curse of the Black Pearl,"The Curse of The Black Pearl isn't a realistic movie about Pirates. It is a movie about pirate myth, based on an idea from the ride. The story about the curse is a good one. The cast is a good one. Geoffry Rush, Orlando Bloom(Lord of The Rings) Johnny Depp, and Kira Knightley. She's in Love Actually, and I would watch her anytime. She's a good young actress also very beautiful. Listen to the commentaries, and you'll hear about (pout 1, pout 2, and pout 3,). She has a sense of humor people. The extras on the Dvd are an added bonus. If you like movies about pirate myth, or if you like the ride at disneyland, or swordplay you should like this Dvd. A costume Drama all the way, a enjoyable ride."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"Pirates is the best movie ever!!! I first saw this movie at the premiere at Disneyland... and then i saw it again and again and again... i mean, come on, even if the plot sucked its Johnny Depp as a pirate! The CGI FX in the movie totally rock. Gore Verbinski is a genius. The sets were amazing and i loved the costumes; Penny Rose is such a wonderful costume designer. The movie was filmed right next to my house so i got to see some of the sets up-close at they totally rock! Every morning when i look out my window toward PV i see that fort and think to myself ""oh man i love that movie!"" I can't wait until the sequel which is comming out in 2006. Hopefully it will be as good as the original... AND JOHNNY DEPP TOTALLY DESERVED TO WIN BEST ACTOR!!!"
5,Wow,"this has got to be the best movie of the year, however not oscar worthy, this movie is filled with excitement, adventure, and much much more. Johnny Depp gives his best performance since FROM HELL, and may have potential for a nomination. A great summer movie. Ten Thumbs up"
3,A fantastic Depp for a weak story !,"According to all the positive reviews, it looks like this movie is one of the best ever made. I will say it's certainly a good entertainment For sure there is nothing to say about Johnny Depp, he's good and without beeing clairvoyant, I can say that there will be a sequel of Pirate of the Caribbean in a couple of years. That's a Hollywood movie with an old recipe making profits easily.Yes, kind of you already know everything in the first minutes that there will be a happy ending, a love story and heroism everywhere.The only thing I will say it's Pirate doesn't create anything new. Many Pirate movies have been made in the past with the same kind of story. Okay it's maybe funnier but well with all the money they had, they could have found a better story where the plot and the final are not so foreseeable and better told.I found some incoherences here and there showing the weakness of the screenplay. Well not sure everybody noticed them."
5,Simply Wonderful!,"This movie is the best movie out this year. A great film full of adventure, laughter, action and sword fights. Johnny Depp steals the show with his brilliant performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. This is a fabulous movie that will be enjoyed by everyone."
3,"Johnny Depp did not disappoint, the ending did...","The best part about the movie is the great acting job that Johnny Depp delivers. The worst, by far, is predictable and lame ending that an 11 year old could have seen coming! Average movie that was salvaged by great acting from one of the best actors in Hollywood."
5,A Depp winner,Johnny Depp gives an outstanding performance that makes this movie a real winner and a lot of fun for both kids and adults! A+
2,Walt Diesny spinning in his grave!!!!!,"In the begging, all Diesny had has a little mouse on a sail boat and people loved. It was called ""creativedy"", somthing Diesney lost when Walt Diesny died. There is no creativedy in this garbage. All it is are pirates running aroung killing each other.I can give this some credit for the action, but there is really no plot to this film. Johnny Deep is the only one who can act in this film. It's about pirates looking for gold so they can break a curse. Thats somthing a nine year old can come up with. The days Diesny had good idea's are long gone. This film is poorly(and I do mean poorly)based on a cool ride at Disney world. Not worth it."
2,Pirate movie without pirates,Depp does well in his performance of Captain Jack and there aredozens of spectaculair scenes...but over all things simply do not get dirty and mean anywhere. Why can't they shoot a decent pirate movie anymore with some real hommicidal maniacs in there? Why do beautiful actrices like Keira Knightley have to be tough at the same time? Girls back then were no sporty spices at all! Why do they always have to come up with those boring politically correct movies? Doesn't anyone want to tell the people how things really went back then? This should be the type of movie entertainment that kids shouldn't be able to watch instead of heavy violence or mature movies! (SARR)
1,The creepiest movie I've seen in a LONG time,"I can't stand Johnny Dep or Orlando Bloom. I go for the old CLASSIC movie stars--aka Gregory Peck, Michael Landon, Jimmy Stewart, etc. Call me old-fashioned. But these modern stars DON'T know how to act! Kissing some girl's face off doesn't make you an actor. And I didn't like it at all that the bad guys--the drunk, murderous theives--got away with everything while the good guys were portrayed as cruel and even stupid.The only good part at all was when Elizabeth blew up the rum. The rest was not funny, just bloody and gory--and CREEPY beyond words. And no, I didn't like LOTR either.Skip POTC and watch something real."
1,You can't rate it when you are still waiting to receive it.,"I ordered this item over a month ago and I am still waiting on it to get here. Supposedly, Amazon shipped it a couple of weeks ago via the USPS. Amazon's tracking of it is useless at best. I guess it must be going through Antartica to get here."
4,Where's all the rum gone?,"Many many years ago, the stories of pirates died in Hollywood, the interest and freshness just left it, and the name of swashbuckling piracy gathered dust in a box on a shelf in the back of a closet. Then, in 2003, Jerry Bruckheimer found the old box, dusted it off and said to himself ""Hey I could use this!"" And use it, he did.With an all-star cast and the best crew in town, Jerry set out to do the unthinkable, resurrect the pirate name. Many people, upon seeing the footage-less teaser trailer thought the film would be so bad it would be a joke, but the director, Gore Verbinki proved them all wrong.Through jolly musical themes, a suprisingly creepy plot, a fantastic cast, and awesome bits of nothing-but-fun action, Pirates of the Caribbean succesfully leaves the veiwer stunned, and wanting more (which, they brought, twice).If you liked Transformers, Night at the Musiem you will probably like this movie.8.5/10"
5,Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...,"Hey Maties...however totally unbelieveable, this is a great movie for entertainment. I thought Johnnie Depp sounded quite inebriated with his dialog in this movie and its sequel, but still enjoyable and humorous in spots. Got nothing to do some evening, no one to do it with and just want to wile away the hours being entertained? This movie is for you."
3,"Great movie, confusing explanation of what you are getting","We bought this as a Christmas gift for our son, thinking that it contained the second movie as well, because the description of the item was not very clear. Would have purchased each movie individually, not the special editions had we realized this. Overall, though, great movie."
5,amazing movie,"this movie was by far one of the best i saw!!! i actually have already seen it 10 times in the theather!! beside for the fact that the two leading actors are (no questions asked) H-O-T-T!!it had a story line that just sucked ya in!!!! if u havent seen this movie i advise you to go see it NOW!!!!!! it had everything comedy,action,romance,fighting! great for gals n guys!"
3,"Cool movie, but lack special features","It's huge surprise on the movie is so cool to watch it. Lot of fun and action. Some scary, of course.Sadly, this movie isn't great to keep for hearing impaired. Because there is no SUBTITLE or CLOSED CAPTION available on special feature. BIGGER DISAAPOINTMENT from Walt Disney."
5,Much better then expected,"Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. Sounds like a good action movie, the kind I wouldn't mind seeing, but it is a million times better then I expected. Of course, the character of Captain Jack Sparrow is what gives the movie the extra something that makes it spectacular, but all in all it was very well done, without being overdone, humorous without being simply stupid, and really wowed me. My sister had no desire to see it, but when it was over admitted it was a great movie. I definitely recommend it."
3,A Pirate version of The Mummy - only better!,"Pirate's of the Carribean is one of those movies you have to go into with no expectations to really enjoy. Although the movie has a good comedic quality about it and a fun, almost silly feel about it, the story line is a little cliched. Johnny Depp takes the cup for making the movie. Orlando Bloom, for all his good looks, just can't act a pirate that well - sorry ladies. Watch all the negative ratings come on this post! Keira Knightley is stunning, and does a decent job playing Orlando's (and Johnny's)love interest. Keep an eye out for her in the near future - this performance is a step up from her role in Bend it like Beckham.In classic Disney tradition, ""Pirates of the Carribean"" is great for family viewing and an ideal show if a lighthearted Pirate yarn is your taste at the moment."
2,invalid format,"First of all I would like to say this was a very entertaining movie. My review is really geared toward the product itself. I wasn't able to play this dvd in my xbox 360, which plays everything except blueray. I would venture a guess and say it wouldn't play in a regular dvd player either. Once I threw it in my computer my media player was able to run the disc. However, it seems like in certain parts of the movie happened maybe 6-8 times the movie would freeze for 6 -10 seconds and didn't show that part of the movie."
3,Too much hype,"This movie was good, but all the hype is overblown. This is not a great movie and I cannot understand how or why Johnny Depp was nominated for an Oscar for this role. See the movie and you'll enjoy it, but it's not an epic film or the best Disney film to date."
4,"I'm Jack Sparrow, savvy!","I think Johnny Depp is one of the most courageous performers working today. To go out on a limb (modeling the character after Keith Richards) without the complete blessing of the studio took guts. As with most Depp creations he leaves an unforgettable impression on the audience. When you team him up with a cast of talent that includes Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush well you can guess the rest. Bloom is developing into a convincing performer, Knightley, despite her beauty, is a surprisingly talented and unselfish actress and I think Geoffrey Rush is incapable of delivering a poor performance. And although her appearance was brief, whoever cast Thandie Newton as a pirate was a genius. The story was great and the special effects were even better. Get yourself a big bag of popcorn and an eye patch, sit back with the kids and enjoy because this movie delivers!"
1,unhappy purchase,Would have liked to know that this item was not able to be used on my DVD player. The fine print on back stated not for use outside of UK
2,One Long Commercial!,"I like many of the actors in this movie, but I found the plot to be boring and it just seemed to be a long Disney commercial to me. No surprise they came out with Haunted Mansion and I'm sure they'll release Space Mountain or the Tea Cup Ride movie soon."
2,"But, where's the rum?","I am giving the movie 2 stars, just to be nice. My closest friends have the DVD, and saw it in theaters 13 times. Yes, 13. I saw it twice in theaters, I was dragged persay, and I found it unbearable to get through the second time. At first, I wasn't real into seeing a movie of pirates. It just isn't my thing. People said the movie was humorous, but really I didn't get any of the humor in the movie. The best part was the end with the monkey at the rolling credit. However, according to my friends it was one of the best movies of the year, so don't take my opinion for it. My friend has her brain into writing fan fictions of pirates. I don't know if the movie was so wonderful because of the hunkalicious Johnny Depp, who I don't find very handsome, or what. However, the actors did a good job, Johnny and Orlando, and any female will start drooling over the presence of these two males. I didn't though. They just aren't my type."
4,Very enjoyable,"This one is another great movie that belongs in my very small and select collection of movies. Like other good movies, this one has all the right ingredients: a good story; solid acting (not just from Johnny Depp but other actors too); humor; romance; clean fun; and just the right amount of special effects. It has my approval."
5,"Great!!!! It would've sucked in ""Fullscreen""","I finally gotta chance to see this movie after my brother brought it home. Even though I had to get up to use the bathroom a few times after way too much pop and coffee, I still enjoyed it. I enjoyed seeing that 2.35:1 aspect ratio in the middle of our 19 inch TV and enjoyed listening to it through our Dolby Pro-Logic Surround system. Now when you're poor like me, you can still enjoy widescreen and SOME surround sound with what you got. Turn out all the lights and the black bars will blend into the darkness and you won't even notice them. I thank Disney for releasing this in widescreen only. Fullscreen belongs on VHS and if Joe 6 Packs want their Fullscreen, they should buy the VHS version. DVD is meant for a much better movie experience and only getting half the picture is not part of it. Thank you again Disney for doing the RIGHT thing.NOW RELEASE SNOW DOGS IN WIDESCREEN DAMNIT!! ;)"
5,The bestest movie on the planet!,"OK, this is by far, the best movie I have ever seen. it has everything in it, action, adventure, swords and romance. It stars Orlando Bloom and Jonny Depp. Just the fact that they are in it, is a good enought reason to watch it!It should win the best movie of the year award!the soundtrack is also great, so those of you who saw the movie should also check out the soundtrack!"
4,Good Movie,"Great Movie! I was unsure about seeing it at first, but my friend practicaly dragged me into it. I ended up loving it! A must see movie. There waws plenty of action, romance and adventure. Everything a pirate movie needed --and more. A must see!"
5,Excellent Movie,"This is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The sword fights are fun to watch and some of the special effects are amazing (like the pirates on the Black Pearl when they are in the moonlight turning to skeletons). Johnny Depp was perfect for the part of Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom was perfect for the part of Will Turner. It's hard to believe that a movie this good came from a ride at Disney World. Which by the way, if you pay close attention, you will notice many scenes in the movie are taken directly from the ride. You do not want to miss this movie, it's excellent."
5,The Most Fantastic Movie of the Year,"As all people, I'm a critic, and it takes a lot to impress me. And let me tell you I was impressed. The movie was wonderful - the special effects were at the height of the entertainment, right along with Johnny Depp's terrific acting abilities. This is by far the best movie of the year and I encourage everyone - men, women and children of all ages - to go see this movie. Whether you're a fan of action, horror, or comedy, even romance, this movie will impress you and leave you twitching for more. Or just to go back and see it all over again."
5,A Pirates Life for Me,"I saw this movie last night, and I really enjoyed it. Good performances (Johnny Depp stands out), awesome special effects, cool fight scenes, Keira Knightley looking seriously hot. Overall an excellent summer blockbuster-type film."
5,Drink up me hearties...YO HO!,"I've always loved pirate movies, even the bad ones, for the sense of adventure and freedom. Never have these traits been better embodied than in Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp's performance is scintillatingly brilliant! Sparrow may be rum-soaked and sun-baked, but he's ten steps ahead of everyone else. From his grandstand docking to his loving caress of his beloved Black Pearl, this movie allows you to escape in the truest sense of the word! Johnny Depp is incredible in this role and deserves the Oscar! I've seen it now 20 times and am returning this evening. Never boring..always exciting! Drink up me hearties...YO HO."
5,Love these movies!,Bought this to complet my collection so we could watch them all before the new one came out and we still havent seen the new one yet but I will just buy it on here!
5,Great family fun!,Love Johnny Depp in the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. This is just a great fun family film. If you love the ride at Disney you also love all the hidden references from the ride.
4,BRILLIANT!,"This movie is very, very good. This was Johnny Depp at his best. This movie is just like the ride at disney, but 2 hours and 30 minutes longer. The action and dialogue was amazing. you should really own this dvd. the whole family will love it.com"
5,"i""ll Keep this short and sweet",If you like action movies with a whole lot of action and whole lot of humor u need to check this out. It is a fun movie that really everyone in my family loves from my parents to my 17 year old brother. It is a great movie.
5,What I loved - he's such a loser and doesn't realize it!,"Depp's character doesn't get much right - from the first scene with the sinking boat that would have been a problem for anyone else (yeah, I meant to do that!) to losing the Pearl and getting caught over and over. But he is so confident and charming and insane that he won't get that he's screwed up - and the beauty is that WE don't quite catch it either. As someone else said, in anyone else's hands Sparrow would be a cartoon. Depp's characterization was brilliant.It's not high art, but if you like Depp at all, it's a lot of fun."
5,the perfect movie,"Ok i know that most of these reviews were written by girls who love to gush about johnny depp and orlando bloom, so i thought i'd add a bit of male perspective.Johnny Depp is a FANTASTIC ACTOR!!!!I've never seen anything like what he did.Absolutely brilliant.Orlando Bloom was basicly stuck with the ""pretty boy"" role,but he was great and he made the most of his few funny lines.Keira Knightly.....................................I know all the girls went to see the movie for Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp,but i went for Keira Knightly..............................Anyway.Geoffery Rush was great at his role.Everybody should see this movie.My ONLY complaint(and its very small)is that the end was a bit too perfect.My fantasy ending is that as Will and Elizabeth start making out,they should fall over the battlements like Jack Sparrow did.But it was a GREAT GREAT movie."
5,america's critic,5* thats all u need to know on this one great if u dont have this one yet get it right now!!!!
5,Fabulous craft book,"This is one of the best books I have ever seen on crafts for kids. It is well written, the directions are concise and the pictures are great. Every educator should own this book! I teach a lot of teachers and highly recommend it."
5,Multiplex 5x5 Karaoke CDG with Guide Vocal Tracks,"PRIDDIS Multiplex 5X5 COUNTRY 2002 VOLUME 8 araoke CD&G; CD from the High Quality PRIDDIS PRO SOUND COUNTRY collection (1500G), This factory manufactured CD comes in a plastic jewel case, plays the music with or without the lead vocals and displays the lyrics on a Karaoke CD&G; player. There is also a printed lyrics booklet included so you can use this disk even if you don't have a karaoke player. This CD has 10 tracks total. The first 5 are without vocals and the second 5 are the same songs with guide vocals in one channel for practice purposes. These songs are not preformed by the original artists but are VERY GOOD re-creations. 1500G - Country 2002 Volume 81.I'm Gonna Getcha Good - Shania Twain.2.Cry - Faith Hill.3.I Keep Looking - Sara Evans.4.Pour Me - Trick Pony.5.Life Goes On - LeAnn Rimes."
3,So-So,It's a so-so game. The graphics are so-so and the gameplay is pretty bad. But the price is great. But for 15 bucks it's worth it.
5,GREAT GAME!!!,"I think Glover is a GREAT game!!! (Even though I don't own it.) You're a live, talking, magic glove and you need to get 6 (I think.) jewels, disguised as rubber balls. I think it's a good game & you should buy it."
4,very slow annoying music,graphics not very sharp and no explanation of what is expected in each world or how or when to use powers.
2,a giant glove. hmmmmmmmm,"Ok so i get the idea that you are a glove rolling on a ball. Hmmmm. Ok well here goes. If you liked this game, you are an IDIOT! HELLO GUYS YOU ARE A GLOVE! WHAT THE HECK IVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH AN IDIOTIC CHARACTER! A GLOVE! FOR GOODNESS SAKES, IVE HEARD THAT ORIGINALITY IS GOOD, BUT THIS? ok i will stop yelling. But jeeze guys cant you see that only some kind of fool would actually enjoy playing as a glove that can balance on a ball? Well I can. So I'm out, enough said."
5,GLOVER ROCKS!,"I love this game, get it! It rocks! The graphics are great, the color is x-treme and it is worth every penny. When I got Glover for N64, I thoght that was a good deal. I can't belive that now it's ony $. This game is a must have for anyone who loves a nice, juicey game."
1,Product Missrepresented,"The product listing states these light tubes are ""Thin-Lite Corp."" products. The items received are an inferior product manufactured in China by a company other than Thin-Lite. I orderd this product specifically because the listing stated a factory product. I have used these inferior tubes in the past, they last only 3-4 months."
2,Did not get yet,Have had these on order for some time. Ordered with spoons and forks which I did receive but as of yet no knives
1,bjgrace,"This flatware if of very poor quality. I would have liked to send it back, but tore the packaging while opening it."
3,"A striking, stunning book, with a Titanic connection","Not so much a science fiction book as a tour through history, stopping at the most amazing, appalling points, including Aztec politics and the sinking of the Titanic."
3,Only buy it if you like punk,"I didnt like it at all, howevery someone who likes punk would probably like it. It is almost all punk and I absolutly hate punk. I really just bought it cause i like the movie and i've seen the movie atleast a billion times. I really dont know what to say other than only buy it if you like punk."
2,not the best cd I'v ever herd,"The only things that saved this cd were goldfinger, the dickies, and nerf herder. The cd was horable besides those three bands the cherry popping daddy's real had a horable song from a horable band so that worked out. The songs buy the other three good bands wern't even that good of songs but they are the only thing that saved it from being a 1."
5,What can I say. . .It has RBF on it!!!,"I only bought this CD b/c it had RBF's spin on Take on Me, which is my favorite 80's song and I love RBF. But, the rest of the CD is phat and I like all the songs on it! A must have party/driving/skanking album!!!"
3,"Love it, Can't wait for new RBF and Ernies","Cool CD but weak songs from Goldfinger and CPDs. Is this the same Deep Blue Something that sung the crappy, sappy, recycled made 2B played Breakfast At Tffany's?!? I LOVE the Ernies. Thank God you spotted em. Bytheway what were ya'll doin out in Richmond, VA? Congrats on another smash Jay and all of MOJO."
4,VERY GOOD FOR A SOUNDTRACK.,"GOOD SONGS INCLUDE: GOLDFINGER, REEL BIG FISH, NERF HERDER, DEEP BLUE SOMETHING, PLASTISCENE. DICKIES HAVE TO BE THE WORST PUNK BAND AROUND. SMASH MOUTH'S SONG IS CRAP, TOO (LIKE ALL THEIR STUFF). CHERRY POPPIN' DADDIES? NO, SWING SUCKS."
1,Psuedoscience instead of recipes,"When I sent away for this book, I thought I was going to get simple recipes as well as hints for best using the blender. Instead there were countless references to the healing power of vitamins, herbs, natural foods etc. None of which have any basis in fact. Unless you are into that sort of astrology, I don't recommend this book at all."
3,Never got this product,The bookstore that I ordered this from said they didn't have this in their inventory so I didn't actually get this. Can't really give a review.
3,Not Impressed,I was so excited when my Smoothie book came in the mail. To my surprize it wasnt what I expected. Some of the ingredients are exotic. Some of the recipes the average person will NOT make. My suggestion is to go to dannon.com or kraft.com and get their recipes they are practical and best of all FREE!
5,really great!,I actually bought this for my mom about a year ago and she's still whirling up those smoothies. She loves the recipes and has been inspired to try out other concoctions as well. I've tried a few of the drinks and all have been delicious. I really like how they have the different sections like immune booster and the like because it shows you not only a good recipe in that sort of category but also helps you to learn about what foods are particularly helpful in certain ways. Four thumbs up from me and my mom.
3,average book for the title,"I agree with the other reviewer.There are alot of recipes with stuff I haven't even heard of.I have tried a couple of these with what ingredients I could find and it wasn't that bad or great either,Maybe tolerable would be the word.I would say if you can find the ingredients good but the book is average."
3,Blue Topaz? Hard to tell!,"These are not as pictured. I objected to the color (a shade of blue that I am not familiar with) because they will not match with any of my traditional blue topaz jewelry, nor will they match the blue topaz I have already purchased for gifts. Hard to tell what kind of stone these earrings are based on the color. However, perfect size for studs with a nice setting. Sadly, for my purposes, these can't be ""keepers."" Please note the word ""coated"" in the description."
2,Disappointed!,"These earrings had a really pale blue color and they were much smaller than expected, but they did match my sister's necklace color."
4,Small but pretty,"Negatives:Small, if that's not what you are looking for(most women now days seem to prefer the larger dangly type).Positives:Very pretty and well priced.Recommend it?Once again if small is what you are looking for this is it. Well of course you say, they are stud earrings after all. I'm telling you they are small, even for average stud type earrings, but they are pretty and my wife likes them."
4,Compilation of info for the busy project manager,"Incisive, concise, and packed with informaiton for the busy executive who wants to be informed about project management within the minimum possible time. Topics include scoping, planning, implementing, and monitoring your projects."
1,Not what I ordered,"I orderd what was listed as 360 grm metal containers of Nido milk powder.What I received was ones made from cardboard and a different size. I wanted the milk powder in the metal tins as adverized and shown in the illustration. NOT another stock item. The vendor said they were not produced any more. My question is why is this style still shown as being available on the website.? The metal tins work better in a more humid enviroment on my boat, the crdboard ones do not. I'm not happy and I will not order items such as this from Amazon again. I've learned my lesson."
2,not very sexy,"I proceeded to open the container then pour it all over myself, in front of my girlfriend. Imagine my embarassment with poweder all over myself.Needless to say the evening did not go as planned.Though I did take a bath, and the water did taste an awfully lot like milk.My fault though, for thinking the company was Nido Powder"
1,Lack of support from Viewsonic,"First of all, I need to make it clear that I do not own one of these devices. I am the site owner of viewsonic gtablet for dummies (google search it). I am writing this review to make people aware that barely 4 months after the viewsonic gtablet was out in the market viewsonic dropped all support for the device. If you call them now about the gtablet, they will deny ever knowing anything about it. That's what going to happen to your viewsonic viewpad if you buy one. We as consumers need to stop supporting such immoral business practices from companies as big as viewsonic."
1,Very Boring Toy,VERY small and VERY boring. Was hard for my 11 month old to use because you have to push very hard for the toy to light up. It is very small. It didn't capture my daughters eye or keep her amused at ALL!
3,love elmos world,"When the elmos world piano arrived all the features were not working properly so I contacted the seller because my daughter loved it so much I didn't want to return it as it would break her heart. So to my surprise the seller offered to give me a partial refund and best of all I could keep the toy. So, in the end it worked out."
4,Excellent toy with one design flaw,My one year old received this toy as a Birthday present and it was a big hit. He absolutely loves it! Daddy never tires of the music because it is always accompanied by giggles and a bright smile! The toy has one design flaw... There are three modes of play. You change modes by turning the music page on the piano. Mode 1 and 3 work as advertised when you turn the page. Mode 2 works as whatever mode was used before it (1 or 3) unless you turn the toy off and back on while in mode 2.
1,Blech!!,"Spirit of the West makes acourageous foray into the pseudo-grunge. If you like their other albums, avoid this one like the plague. I bought it used and sold it only slightly more used."
5,good bio of a interesting person,Good book and full of great info on a real vagabond . Great read before rereading On The Road by Jack Kerovac
3,The Holy Goof!,"Although I like Neal's letters (I wish that most of the infamous ""Joan letter"" was not lost) at the back better than the book itself, I believe it is still an important story in the BEAT Canon. Cassady was the energy behind two iconic books: On the Road and Electric Kool-Aid. He was a physical and mental marvel and that seemed to have a genuine kindness behind his madness. He never seemed able to escape his demons, however, and died too young. Still, his energy is still felt in some circles today and I have never met a fan of the BEAT Generation that wasn't a fan of Neal Cassady."
4,not bad,it is a cute charm but broke way too easily at the attachment and wasnt repairable. but its ok the cost wasnt so high where i was too concerned about that
5,THE BEST!!,"I have loved Donell from his first CD> AT first I was not feeling him with his Stevie Wonder remake in '96- but he won my heart. Now after his second CD- ""WHERE I WANNA BE"" ""LIFE GOES ON"" is just as good, if not better. My favorites are--- Life Goes on, DO U Wanna, Where you are- is where I wanna be pt 2., -I'm not too crazy about # 7 and 8- but overall this album is a MUST!!"
5,EXCELLENT,"This CD is the best I've heard in a long time. Although I was sleep on it when it first came out, I have promoted it as if I was getting paid. To this day I still bump it, and I even bought another copy recently. Donell, you gets mad love from me on this!!!"
5,GREAT R & B CD EVER,"I thought his second album, ""Where I Wanna Be"" was the best one he would ever have. But when I heard this new one I changed my mind. EVERY song has an unique rhytm to it. The whole cd is great. I recomended to everyone who enjoys R & B."
5,Consistent,"Even though Donnell harps on his love for his chic on EVERY song, I can't say I don't like that. Male singers rarely focus on love. He's definitely in touch with his feelings. Even when he wasn't sure he wanted to be with his chic on ""Where I Wanna Be,"" at least he was being honest about his feelings. He's redeemed himself on this new one. I love it. I've listened to it for a week straight. While his voice isn't extraordinary, the songs are well-written and catchy. I don't even have a favorite song; I like them all. It's a good buy."
5,SKIN-TIGHT!!!,Donell Jones is back with his ever-smooth and simmering lover-man visions. Jones' stays true to his style of silky smooth vocals and fluid rhythms. This album has a great balance of mid-tempo grooves and boudoir melodies that will definitely give you that certain sumthin' sumthin'. Ya gotta go get this.
3,"Pretty good, but he's done better","I really like Donell Jones and his music. This album was pretty good but he has done better. His previous album ""Where I Wanna Be"" is his best work in my opinion. I was in love with literally every song on that album. This one, however, isn't as hot. I like to hear slow jams by Donell.. in this album, I think the couple more up-beat songs are kinda wack. But still I'd say it is a CD worth buying."
3,SMOOOOOOOOOTHZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....,"Donell Jones certainly has some smooth tracks here: #3 is an effortless jam, and he does have some cool party tracks (#1 and 2 especially) and sweet ballads. However, after track 5, everything manages to blend in a bit too much: its gets monotonous and pedestrian. He has evidently grown with lyrics and vocals...he just needs to stretch out more. If you like edgier R&B, get with someone like Raphael Saadiq and leave this frothy stuff for your club/freaky-deaky moments."
5,Donell Jones is the best!,"Not only is this album the best thing to come out this year, all of Donell's previous albums are the best, and his unreleased songs, soundtrack songs. I have them all. I gotta say, Donell Jones will be a legend."
4,Donell............,"Okay I love Donell but this album could not touch his second, which was a classic. I mean, it was a good effort but he can do much better. I'm waiting for his 3rd effort which should drop some time soon. Overall, though, you should add this to your collection, especially if you're a big Donell fan."
4,X does not always mark the even if it is green,"The xbox is great system for people 12-25,but it is a little short on games for someone not in this group.Beware if you buy this I can almost guarantee games,controllers,and dvd remotes will probably be scare with the 360 already here now.This time next year this system may be in clearance.But don't be so quick to jump in xbox360(no matter the commercials say) you will just be jumping into 60 dollar games. It is best to wait until the psp comes or nintendo rev. before buying anything. If you already have one trading in maybe a bad idea market value goes very quickly now."
2,XBOX IS ONE OF THE WORST POSSIBLE SYSTEMS YOU COULD GET IN 50 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all,I own a Ps2 myself and by far I think it is the best dang console I've ever played.Second of all,I don't own an Xbox but I've played it at my cousin's house before and I'm not very happy with the games that are made because there are mostly games geared more towards what adults would probably play and I'm nowhere near the age of 17 or 18 right now so that's why I'm not allowed to play Mature rated games because of intense violence mostly.Last of all,I don't like the Xbox because there are barely any games I could or would want to play.If you are looking for a system that is geared more toward the ages between 6-12 get a Gamecube or Ps2 you won't be disappointed if you get Ps2 or Gamecube rather than Xbox and you're between the ages of 6-12."
1,nah i don't think so.,too many grown up games too much stuff to get in my way too big and bulky nope this is not for me i like gamecube and why do i need a dvd player in here huh? i've already got one!!
1,Microsoft thumbs its nose at customers again!,"For those of us who don't want to spend $400 on a new system, the older Xbox was fine. And $150 was an acceptable price. But now Microsoft has ""bundled"" all the consoles with a really lousy game that we don't need and don't want, and inflated the price by $30. It's highway robbery, and because of it NOONE SHOULD BUY THIS BUNDLED PACKAGE! IT'S A TOTAL RIP!!!!! Don't buy this bundled system for $180!!!"
1,BUYERS BEWARE-2 CONSOLES BROKE IN 1 YEAR!,"Buyers beware with the XBOX console. We purchased our console last year as a holiday gift. Within 1 month our first unit broke because of hard drive failure. We were able to return this unit to the store and exchange it within the 90 warranty period. 10 months later, the new console also broke, same problem-hard drive broke. Now we are past the warranty period, own over 10 xbox games (each at a cost of $40 plus), and also have about 7 new games waiting for Santa delivery (these are now a worthless gift unless I want to send our unit into XBOX, pay $80 plus shipping and wait 6 weeks for the item to return). I then question the reliablity of this new unit. Something that breaks twice in one year, is NOT FUN, NOT DURABLE AND NOT EDUCATIONAL! One star is an exageration. Friends of mine have had their PS2 systems for over 4 years with no problems. I recommend checking out that system. Save money and frustration!"
1,You suck Microsoft,"I was planning on buying an Xbox this very day, but the system is no longer availabe by itself.The only way to get a new Xbox is to buy it bundled with Forza Motorsport. I suppose that's fine if you want the game, but why does Microsoft assume everyone wants some lame racing game?Now if the price had stayed the same as the console by itself($150), I wouldn't care. I'd buy the system, and give the game away. But the price has been jacked up by $30.Why the hell should I pay an extra $30 for a game I don't want!?"
4,"Very good, full of emotion.","It was a good book, very inspirational. It was very well written, since both sides were explained very well. Such a tradgedy should be more publicized, since the young kids in the world are just going to keep on doing the same thing. It was a great book, I couldn't put it down."
5,A Silent Tale of A Beauty,"I think that the phrase ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" is completely true in Marilyn's case. Just looking at the pictures you can see her real zeal for life and yet her horrifying sorrow. Her life speaks without words of the sad times before medicine was properly dispensed for depression and the like. She had many up's in her life, yet the sad is what remains in our minds for her. I really learned alot of the value that life holds and the cold value that the movie industry holds for life as well. I feel that learning even the sad lessons such as MM's is very important for everyone of any age."
2,a bit of a let down,"half of this book is writing, and the pictures are good, but there isn't enough. this is a little book, so only get it for the rare couple of photos."
3,Unfortunately Brazilian Music is not Latin Music!,"I am Brazilian and I have been a big fan of Ms. Gorme for her extraordinary voice and feeling when singing in her native language and in Spanish. So I should be specially proud about this album but ... there's something wrong here!This is one her albums with Bossa Nova ensemble but arrangements do not hip as they should. Unfortunately, Brazilian Music is not to be approached as a Latin sound with 'maraccas' and all that percussion typical from Cuba.Despite this big discomfort, you'll find great renditions of 'Dansero', 'The Sweetest Sounds', 'Almost Like Being in Love' and the Brazilian samba 'The Message'."
1,When Will A Career Retrospective Be Available?,"What a shame that ""Blame It On the Bossa Nova"" is not a greatest hits album! And, yes, what a shame that her other CD which appears to be a greatest hits package - Golden Hits - is not a definitive retrospective of her hits either! What's going on? Almost everyone of her CDs contains only a few tracks. When will we get a chance to hear ""Don't try to Fight It Baby"" or ""I Want You To meet My Baby""? Please give us a CD or double CD packed with this wonderful woman's hits!"
5,Extremely durable case!,"I received my first Nite Ize case at the Verizon store, when a different brand case failed prematurely. That was over 4 years ago. This case perfectly fits my Casio flip-phone and it has been great! It has a nice wide belt-clip to fit wide work-belt.There is a hook on the bottom of the belt clip that insures that it cannot fall off your belt, even when running. The magnet closure is another bonus. My friend has a velcro closure and it is quite loud to open if you need to check or send a text message in business meeting or class setting. The velcro also gets quite worn after repeated usage.I just bought a new one to ""have on hand"" when the current case fails in the years to come. As long as your phone fits, you will LOVE this case!"
5,Warning,"The other reviewers have said as much as I could say about how great this book is, but just a warning--if you already read or have Desert Rose by the same author, Nevada Jade is the same basic story, with different names. It isn't an exact copy; Desert Rose has been expanded and a some details changed, but for the most part the story is the same. Nevada Jade is still worth buying, though, just because Linda Chaikin is such a great author and tells a wonderful story."
3,Jade's Must Take Her Place,"Jade with her sister and brother are searching for their father in Nevada. Jade a victim of TB is planning to settle near the claim of her father's and paint. She meets Roark Montgomery who is searching for her father to arrest him for a murder and crippling his father. Jade must conquer her inferiority complex and Roark must learn to forgive. Can they overcome their problems and have a future together? This book's outline is too much like Desert Rose. by Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
4,Nice item.,"Purchased the Dragonfly metal artwork for our remodeled bathroom. It looks great along side the other artwork. One thing to watch for are the sharp edges when handling it. We decided to paint it to better match our colors, no problems with painting."
4,size differs,i really like this itemthe picture is a bit misconceiving it is smaller and thinner than it looksbut it is really cool.they do not include hanging elements which would be nice
4,dragonfly wall art,"the product was so cute. i absolutely loved it. the only thing i didn't like so well, was that it was smaller than i thought it was going to be. other than this, it is a great item!!"
5,Great looking piece!,"Great piece! It comes in bare metal, ready to paint any color you want. I've gotten a few compliments on it already."
3,Classics are the best!,"Very good quality and sound, wasn't the bit disappointed. I love Shaw Brothers martial arts films and the production of this dvd didn't take anything away from it."
2,It works,"The plug fit adequately and the ear piece fits and is positioned alright, but there is no way to adjust the volume so the caller is barely audible."
3,nokia wired headset,"sound quality is very good to excellent, but the shape is not very adaptable - it doesn't fit very well in my ear as a result and i need to press it into my ear to hear well... not really hands free... If if fits you well you will love it - I have had better luck with in the ear style headphones that you can really stick in your ear - you can hear better..."
3,Funnier if Heard,"Being in my mid-twenties, I'll admit that my generation is more familiar with ""Three Amigos"" era Steve Martin, more so than ""Wild & Crazy Guy"" era Steve Martin. However, having seen him do SNL in the 70's (thanks to the DVDs) I was very interested and curious to hear this album.The first thing I noticed was that the audio quality is quite poor. It's often VERY hard to hear what he's saying on stage. I usually listen to comedy albums when taking long road trips, and I had to max out the volume in my car to be able to hear at times. Secondly, some of his visual stick doesn't translate well to audio. However, since I managed to get this on a wicked awesome sale from Amazon, I got my money's worth of laughs and entertainment."
3,The visual performance doesn't translate well to CD,"I'm just now going back and getting all the stand-up material of great old comics who long since moved on to film, such as Martin, Allen and Murphy. Though he was a mostly ingenius stand-up comic, Steve Martin was already as absurd as any human being could follow along with. Now without the visual part of his act it gets really hard to keep up. With some of his songs, staged accidents, dropped guitars, and surreal drug metaphors, it's hard to tell what's happening with the aural experience alone. I'm trying to track down video to get the full experience.A few of his songs weren't that funny, and there were a few uncalled for puns, but 90% of the time he's a killer comic here. If only I could follow the CD version of his act 100% of the time."
5,Steve Mr Crazy Martin,This is a funny album. I like Steves Comments on smoking especially since I am not a smoker myself and among other things his trademark Well Excuuussse Meeee. This is a good album as I said and you should get it.
5,The Quintessential Steve Martin Album,"The best of Steve Martin's comedy records. Features plenty of his fantastic banjo playing and many of his classic jokes and songs, such as Ramblin' Guy, Let's Get Small and his Grandmother's ageless wisdom."
5,"WOW, this album is sick!","Strange Fruit Project is in my top five rappers of all time! Their laid back, jazzy, soulful style is matched by few. If you can find this album, pick it up!"
4,Wait a minute...,"In response to ""A music fan from Van Nuys, CA United States"". Fulanito might not be a REAL merengue band but either are the few that you mention. They in the genre of Merengue-Pop. That is like calling Justin Timberlake an R&B artist.What Fulanito does is re-mix Old-Style Merengue (Merengue Tipico) with rap, usually getting the original artist or the old-school musician to perform in the re-mix.I believe that 4 tracks on this album and a total of 15 tracks in their current collection is for pure dancing the night away! Many of these songs are played at the Copa.Fulanito is not Merengue or Rap... They are a revival band."
4,Biased Account,"A very interesting read. Be warned however, that Genghis Khan's life only accounts for approximately 1/3rd of the book as the rest covers the subtitle.The author goes to great lengths to point out how evil Christian Europe is compared with the Great Khan. His violent exploits are merely glossed over. This reactionary work tries to break the stereotypes Genghis Khan has found himself encumbered with over the centuries. Instead of embracing his legacy however I find myself questioning the veracity of the source material.Overall though this book was worth picking up if not only for the accounting of Genghis Khan's life. While the exploits of his brothers and grandchildren are certainly important historically they aren't nearly as interesting."
4,Loses focus at the end,"Good book, but looses focus at the end when it goes from the Story of Genghis Khan to it's descendands for more than 2 generations. Very good reading, however."
5,Fantastic Read. An incredible true story that reads like Fiction.,"Weatherford tells the incredible story of the Mongolian empire in a style that transports you back to the 13th century. The books follows a recently translated 700 year old biography of Ghengis Kahn, and its told in such a way that you feel like you're reading fiction. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Ghengis the diplomat!,What a truly fascinating account of one of the most notoriously ruthless leaders in history....and at the same time we learn what brilliance and vision this man had in creating a new world order of trade.
3,Revisionist,"Fascinating book, and prior reviewers have summarized it well. My only comment is that Weatherford eulogizes him far too often. His accomplishments came at the expense of those he conquered. Lest we forget.... An army of 200,000 men does not move without supplies across 2,000 miles without living off the local population, for example. Massacre of the ruling class was considered barbaric in the 13th century, but it certainly made his takeover of Pakistan and Turkey simple. His descendents' methods were the inspiration of Nazi Germany, down to their ludicrous adoption of the swastika, for example.Other than that, it is extremely well written and entertaining."
1,Mediocre popular history,"For a more accurate account of Ghengis Khan there are any number of more scholarly works. Amongst this books problems is that it ignores most of the vast number of independant, contemporary Asian critiques of Ghengis Khan and the Mongols as murderers of millions. Various books, such as The Mongols by David Morgan, have translations of contemporary Persian, Chinese and Arab sources which paint a much different picture than Weatherford does. This diverse set of critical accounts, with authors representing many different religious, social and economic groups, presents a challenge to any favorable account of Ghengis Khan, a challenge Weatherford doesn't meet. He provides no real basis for dismissing these many independantly written accounts. He doesn't even indicate, unlike every single other Mongolian history I have ever read, how common and universal such accounts were."
4,Genghis Khan,Enjoyable book.Gives a different version of the Mongol Empire some of which may be just from Mongol viewpoint.
3,"Content Excellent, Style Flat","This book is excellent in terms of content--Weatherford appears, on the basis of exhaustive research, living in Mongolia, etc.--to know as much or more than anyone on earthabout Genghis Khan--but tedious with reference to the style and quality of the narrative. I have no quibbles with content in terms of clarity of information, but the book reads as a kind of ""book report"" informational stream--""data"" is presented, but in a very one dimensional way. There is no figurative language, irony, or implied perspective of any kind from the author. After a while one get's a kind of reader's version of ""listener fatigue"" from traveling across the consistently stony ground of Weatherford's narrative. However, a great deal of information is presented--clearly--and the picture that emerges of Genghis Khan is really quite extraordinary."
4,Very well written by an anthropologist,"Most biographies are written by historians, but this one is by an anthropologist and is very well done. Lots of detail I probably could have done without, but nevertheless a fascinating picture of the Mongol Empire and especially on the results of this 13th century phenomenon that affects us today. Learning how the Mongol Empire ceased was a big surprise and a head slapper. Great research, well written, super read."
3,Kahn Polemic,"The first part of the book was a good read. It covered the life of Genghis Kahn sufficiently to get the sense of the man as a human being rather than the monster history has often shown him to be.However, the last part of the book seems to step out of the history telling mode and into what seemed to me to be a quite biased view of the legacy of Kahn.To me, the last part of the book (maybe the last 1/3), was a waste of time. It made one doubt the honest scholarship in the preceding 2/3 of the book. Thus, to get the full picture of Genghis Kahn, one has to look farther afield than this book only. If this is the only book you read about Genghis Kahn, you will have an incomplete idea of who he was and the impact he had on history."
3,Seemed Too Generalized,"Technically a revisionist history, it makes some interesting points and serves as a good (if simplified) history of the Mongols and their conquest of most of Asia and Europe. I expected more, though - a more detailed history, more on the individual campaigns. The revisionist ideas are quite interesting, though. That the Mongols have been portrayed historically as savages who destroyed society needs to be re-examined, because they did bring secular rule and arguably triggered the European Renaissance. Definitely not a waste of time, but if you're looking for a complex history of the Mongol Empire, I would look elsewhere."
4,The mystries of the Mongol invasion are laid bare for us,"Anyone who has visited Russia has seen the high cheekbones of the facial features that reveal a strong Far Eastern impact on the European population here. The invasion and long period of rule by the Mongol tribes lead by Genghis Kahn explain the mixture of genetic material that brought this about. The larger story of an integration of a huge area of the world previously contained in pockets of religious, cultural, and geographical isolation is well told by the author. A quick and easy read of a fascinating history of a major part of the world."
5,Fascinating,"I purchased this book expecting a dry historical review of this mythical figure. Boy, was I wrong! The author writes in such a beautiful style that he pulls the reader into the world of Genghis Khan, without sacrificing historical facts. You find yourself living in Mongolia in the 12th and 13th centuries, traveling thousands of miles with the Khan, watching the empire grow and slowly fall apart. It is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I highly recommend it not only for its educational value but for its absorbing narrative. Beautifully written!"
5,A History Book You Can't Put Down,"Few of us learned about the Monghols in college. Until I read this book, I didn't know Genghis Khan from the Aga Khan. The book tells one a great deal about the Monghols--not only their rise under Genghis Khan but their history through Kubilai Khan and beyond. This will interest those with an interest in China as well as those with an interest in learning more about the Monghals. It is an excellent read and never tells you more than you want to know"
5,well written book,exremely lucid and gripping prose; informative and an eyeopening experience; breaks all my/our notions and bias about the mongols and their lasting achievements.
1,very poorly written,"This book is very poorly written. There are grammatical errors, lots of repetition, and so much awkward writing that I, my grandfather and my stepfather all had to put it down.I think the only reason this book gets such good reviews is that it is one of the more easily-accessible books on the subject. As soon as there are more mainstream books on the topic, this one will fall by the wayside."
1,Genghis Khan and the Maiking of the Modern World,I got the book in a timely fashion and its an excellent book but it goes from page 252 to 285..NOT PLEASED that a hunk of it was left out.
5,An Absolute Must Read for Everyone Interested in History,"Dr. Weatherford's book is an incredible account of the Mongol world of Genghis Khan and his descendents. Once you finish reading Weatherford's book, you will understand how Temujin's reign and his ideas influenced our present day world. Your education and knowledge level of the ancient and modern world is incomplete until you have read this book. Genghis Khan was ahead of his time and has received a ""bad rep"" by western historians.... until now! At age 66, I feel that I have finally learned the truth."
5,Great introductory book,"I think this was a great introduction to Genghis Kahn and the Mongolian Empire. I didn't much of anything before and felt that the book was fair and based on the information that is available. It was easy to read and very interesting, yet had the benefit of being very informative. It isn't the textbook detail some may be looking for, but is a great way to learn about the rise and fall of the Mongolian empire. Genghis comprised only about the first half of the book, the remainder involving the continuation of the Mongol empire after Genghis including the decline and some of the effects of the empire that we can still see today."
4,"First half of the book is very good, then it gets boring","read the first half , you will love it and will change your perception about the great Khan. Once he dies (in the book) and it happens at the middle of the book, you can close it..."
3,Genghis Khan,"Read this for my book club and thought it would be interesting since so little seems to be known about this amazing conqueror. Found it spotty, too much conjecture in the details without sounding at all authentic Also did not find the writing flowed well."
4,Genghis Kahn and the Making of the Modern World - A good read,"Completely historical, yet completely accessible to the casual reader of history. Reads well and holds interest. The author clearly carries a bias for his subject and rarely passes up an opportunity to glowingly compare the Mongol culture to all others, especially the western eurpean, but in the end this nod to current fashion is only a minimal distraction to a well written, interesting account."
5,A MUST READ,Everyone that is interested in politics should read this book. It is truely amazing. I traveled to Mongolia this summer and the Mongolians truely lookup to Chengis Khan and for good reason.
4,Very enlightening if you thought Ghenkis Khan was just a bloodthirsty barbarian.,Ghenkis Khan's control of such a large area from China to Hungary really facilitated international trade between east and west.
4,Solid book: challenges western-centric perspectives,"There are two great things about this book: first, it is well-researched and second, it does a nice job of intertwining culture (modern and ancient) into history. Weatherford adds enough curious anecdotes to keep the average reader happy (read: amusing) without compromising his own thesis. What I was surprised about is how much impact the Khan's actually had on modern culture... and some of the fundamental philosophies we have failed to embrace (resulting in short-sighted geopolitics). All in all, the book shows that, in the end, the Khan's were oh so human (the fatal flaw)- how do we escape ourselves to save ourselves - who knows, the Khan's may have left us a real life morality play... you read and decide...it's worth it."
3,Grain of salt,"I agree, the book does almost read more like a novel than like history, but I'm not sure that's really a good thing. The claims get a bit grandiose in the final third of the book, and culminate with the spectacularly false claim that Genghis Khan's battle tactics inspired the Soviet ""trick"" to lure Germany to over-extend itself during its invasion of the Soviet Union.With at least one such glaring error, it's a little hard to be comfortable that there aren't more. Did the Mongols really invent cannons, the Enlightenment and the printing press? Was Genghis Khan really a poitical and social and military genius?Probably pays to read this with a little skepticism, or to triangulate with other sources."
2,Saint Genghis -- Oh My!,"In reading the more critical reviews this book, I was surprised not to find the word ""hagiography"" mentioned. From the Mongol perspective Temujin was a great man, but read other histories of the lands he invaded and conquered and you will find him not so greatly respected. A great deal of blood went into the making of his empire. In today's world that kind of activity would land him in the World Court for crimes against humanity.The book is enjoyable enough if you do not think too critically or read with the eye of a copy editor. If you are an historian, the book will probably make you wince, and don't you just love it when an author cites a ""secret"" history. Credibility flies out the window even for someone as unlearned in history as I."
5,Excellent macrocosmic look at Mongol civilization,"Weatherford has done what many thought impossible- a thoughtful, innovative work that combines a personality (Genghis Khan)-driven narrative with a careful analysis of the bigger picture. Weatherford's intimate knowledge of Mongol culture and customs helps illustrate some of the more bizarre accounts of Westerners unfamiliar with such details.There are some innaccuracies. Weatherford maintains that before the Mongols there was no contact between Europe and China. He ignores the experiences of the Radhanites, Dark-Age Jewish merchants who travelled to the Far East and founded Jewish colonies in T'ang-dynasty China. Nonetheless this is as flawless an account of the rise and fall of the Pax Mongolica as I have ever seen."
4,A wonderful and positive gay male voice,"The best of McGehee's warm, humorous works, this piece gives an unsentimental and sometimes harrowing look into lives disrupted by AIDS--or, perhaps more to the point, into the lives of men who refuse to let their lives be disrupted by a virus."
5,Buy this book!,"This is by far the late Peter McGehee's best book. McGeheemanaged to put together an outstanding book that examines the lives of several friends, some of whom are HIV positive, some are activists, some are straight, etc. This book is an honest look at everything from gay bars to the AIDS nightmare in less then contemporary Canada. (And the American heartland) Sadly, McGehee has died since this book was written. However, anyone who reads Boys Like Us must not miss Sweetheart, which is the sequel."
4,Good Book from a Good Author,"This author makes his living on plot twists. Just when you think you have it figured out there is a new course. The story is a good one and very well told. The author has his historical facts correct which is important in this type of book. I would like more to a story, the editors in the 70's must have been paid per word they cut as it seams most books of that era are a little on the short side. That aside this is a good yarn with a good story."
5,Perhaps the most fun spy novel ever written,"There may be other spy novels that are deeper, or more complex, or more realistic, but as a heavy consumer of the genre I have never read one that is more fun. The action is great, and it is full of great twists and turns. . Even better, though, is the dry humor and witty dialogue between the two heroes (Smith and Schaeffer). You can read it in a single rainy afternoon (and probably will)."
3,Could hear the music as I read,"Classic book, interesting to read the differences between the book and film. Great story, characters and just plain entertaining. But could not get the music score out of my head."
5,This book was exccelent it was a must read.,If you haven't read this book you have got to get your hands on it. The action and suspense were amazing Alistair Maclean is one amazing auther. There were so many twists and turns in this book I thought I was going to get sea sick. If you like any war novel this book is definetly for you.
5,Aamazing and gripping,The story of commandoes who parachute into enemy territory during the second world war on a rescue mission. This is arguably the best book that Alistair McLean has ever written. Every page brings more surprises and action. Definitely unputdownable.
4,for world war fans,"I honestly do not like to read books, but the book:"" Where Eagles dare,"" caught my interest very quickly. Anyway's if your into the hole World Wars, then this book will satisfy your senses. Eight allied agents, seven men and a single female where dropped out of an airplane into the mountains behind enemy grounds. Now seriously jumping out of a plane in a full blown out blizzard seams pretty stupid, but you cant tell me that you enjoy like to jumping out of a plane in a blizzard. The allied agent's mission was to rescue the general from behind enemy lines. The Nazis were forcing him to spill his secret plans for D-day. One of the most interesting points to the novel was the whole cliff haging Sean. But of course that was not the most interesting point of the whole book, because if it was then it would not be good at all. Finally the last part of the book is, well I won't spoil the ending for you so just go get the book and read it for your self. Trust me it is worth wile."
5,An amazing book,"This book is one of MacLean s best. It is full of suspense and action from the very beginning. I thought he did a very good job of bringing the characters to life. There were enough plot twists and turns, as well as double, and even triple-agents to keep anyone guessing. A great book!"
3,Just too unbelievable!,"I have read Ice Station Zebra and the Guns of Navaronne, and enjoyed them both. But I found this book just too farfetched. The Allied agents wander aroung Gestapo headquarters barely running into any Germans, even thought the Germans know they are in the area. Those they happen to bump into come one at a time and are easily subdued, and tied up in too convenient hiding places. Could you imagine Russian spys wandering around CIA headquarters or US spies strolling down the hallways of KGB headquaters without being seen or noticed. The good points of the book are a plot that keeps you guessing on exactly what is going on. But I guess I expect better from MacLean. As for the previous complaint that Helicopters did not exist in WWII, the Germans developed the FW 61 Helicopter in 1937, which in 1938 maintened an altitude of 11,000 for 1 hour and 20 minutes. So in MacLeans defense, maybe his research was not that bad."
3,It's NOT a PAINT by number...,it comes with small pencils and you just color however you want to color it. Disappointed of course that item wasn't anything that it said that it was.
3,a little disappointed,"first off i love the cult,ok so don't think im being unfair,but if you like the cult and want all their cd's regardless of what anyone has to say then get this one LAST. i started out with high octane cult to see what they were like and loved it.then i got love and totally fell in love with it but when i bought electric it was so annoyingly loud i wondered why ian would destroy his beautiful voice like that? but tracks 1,2,3,8.9 are the best!"
2,Major disappointment,"This album was one of the biggest disappointments in rock. After the soaring, sweeping guitars of ""Love,"" this album came across as a cheap metal album. One reviewer says it is the album AC/DC should have made; maybe so, but the Cult were on the road to something completely different, something that transcended bar-rock. There were a couple of decent songs, but Rick Rubin's color-by-numbers production is just a terrible mix with the Cult's ethos. Instead of soaring spirituality, it's plain old earthbound mediocrity. The Cult never recovered, although ""Sonic Temple"" is a much better album than this. If you want the real thing, though, get ""Love."""
2,"What Happened to the Glory of ""Love""?","I remember buying ""Love"" when it first came out and I fell in love with the Cult. There was this raw and wild edge to their music. But ""Electric"" was just not up to the same standard. It sounded like ""AC/DC Meets Marc Bolan"" (and I am a T.Rex fan!)"
1,horrible,"This album is the worst in the career of The cult Horrible, sad. I don 't like it. Please don't listen this album....."
1,Step Away from the Led Zep and No One Will Get Hurt,"Rick Rubin, what the heck did you do? I have heard that Beggars Banquet has a different version of this album, before you got your hands on it. I'm hoping so, and if anyone can find a link to that album let me know.Yes, the metalkids loved this when it came out. As a fan of Love, to be completely blunt I hated it. I think this album is the litmus test for the Cult. If you sort-of like it but not really, then head to the back catalog. If you love it and think it just rocks out hard, then progress to the forward catalog.I bought this the day it came out, and was completely disappointed. The 1 star it does get is for the fact that Love Removal Machine is a guilty pleasure. Put it this way, the metalkids in Camaros loved this album. I didn't."
2,"Are the Cult Beyond Good and Evil,","So you wanted a new Cult's release: here you are. I find the title of the album says everything (a declaration of principles if you want), they think they are beyond.... but are they? It is impossible to compare this cd with Electric or Sonic Temple. Once again a band trying to rebirth from their ashes but this time the formula didn't work. But well, here it is another Cult album, and there is just one thing you can do: LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM. It is your choice."
1,GO FIGURE...,"PEople give five stars to this album. I'll tell you about the CUlt. This is a band without any substance, a boring pseudo-pop-rock-metal-new wave band, that only tries to copy AC/DC and ZZ Top in this ELECTRIC (which is considered their best album!! Imagine the others!!) Everything here sounds a copy. The singer Astbury is horrible."
4,No apologies needed for The Cult's rockingest CD,"This CD is a stripped down rocker showcasing all the raw talent inherent in the band. Some Cult fans whined about the different direction,but as recording artist's, these guys delivered a serious one-two punch for hard rock and roll fans. I totally dig it when players show the talent to step up to the plate, reverse batting stance,and then knock a home run.BUT...the best part about this CD is just cranking it and jamming down. What a reward! These songs would have been wasted with any other producer---the stars lined up just right---and rock and roll magic was created for all to hear.Buy a copy today!"
5,classic,i have worn out two audio casette tapes of this album and just got the cd a couple weeks ago.great from begining to end.simply great.
1,Emma in lesbian love tryst,"I was so excited when i saw this book; imagine, more of my beloved friend, Emma! However, I was dismayed to find that Emma Tennant, the author, could distort and trivialize these characters I had grown to love. Please! Emma kissing a chick, even if she was really a man, is unthinkable. Please do not read this if you want to think of Highbury the same way."
1,God-awful garbage!,"This book deserves NO stars. I love Jane Austen, and have been reading her novels since the age of 10. The characters have become so real to me over the years, and so I scooped up the sequel to my favorite Austen work, EMMA,and was amazed to find the spirited, self-centered (but lovable) heroine of Austen's work degraded into a whining twit who seeks sexual and emotional fulfillment from the husband who treats her as little more than a sister. Moreover, she toys with the idea of finding it in the company of another WOMAN. This is not the place for risque situations and sexual frustrations -- this is Austen's world; please respect the rules!!"
1,Absolute Trash!,"If you love ""Emma"" as much as I do and you really want to read some more, try ""Jane Fairfax"" by Joan Aiken - it's so much better than ""Emma in Love""! I felt like Emma Tennant polluted all the characters I grew to love in the original. Truly bad!"
1,Disappointed Reader,"I found ""Emma in Love"" to be extremely disappointing! Mr. Knightley is an old fogy, his brother is churlish, Jane Fairfax is even more of a non-entity than in Jane Austen's ""Emma"", Mr. Churchill is back to being a cad, and Emma herself is unconvincing and has lost her confidence. The story is choppy and disjointed and has overtones of homosexuality. Ms. Tennant does get an accurate conversational style and has the ability, I think, to write some really good ""imitation-Austen"". But the overall idea and the plot left a lot to be desired!"
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars,"Tennant writes: Mrs. Elton, like a shark that waits in waters bloodied by a fall, swam up with her repeated offer of an excellent situation for Jane. Need I say more? What ever possessed Tennant to think this gory word picture would bring to mind the beautifully restrained writings of Jane Austen? Austen's polite restraint and gentle humor are only a few of the reasons she can deal so effectively with the controversial topics of her times. While this book wrestles with controversial topics, it is done without finesse, beauty or regard for Austen's original character development. What passes for wit in this book comes across as mocking Austen's characters and style. I wanted to like this book but wound up hating it."
1,Really BAD continuance of Emma. Shame on the author Emma Tennant,"I LOVE Jane Austen novels. I was excited to read a sequel, but this one was TERRIBLE. How could Emma Tennant take Jane Austen's beloved characters and turn them into whining, conniving, vindictive people?If you love Jane Austen, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Terrible."
2,In need of serious revision...,"I purchased several of the high yield and brs reviews for dental boards. As far as the high yield series goes, this one is by far the worst. Most of what is in this book is really basic info, like stuff you learned in Cell Biology as an undergraduate student. It may get you through the boards, but I really doubt this alone could help achieve a high score. Either save your twenty-five bucks and use your class notes, or buy another review text...cause this one sucks!"
1,A caring man's advice: DON'T BUY IT,"This book is as unethical as reviews ever come.....Unbelievably expensive 25 USD for its value. A lot of essential very high yield materials are NOT even mentioned. A lot of low yield irrelevant materials mentioned. I dont think the author had a clue what is important. If you wanna a great high yield, get the behavioral science or neuroanatomy high yields but NEVER waste your money on this insulting ""review"" book.BRS biochemistry is excellent alternative if you have the time or the back of lippincotts review(at the very end) I hope this was a helpful advice."
2,terrible,"this book is terrible - hardly any info, almost no clinical information, no questions. go with lippincott"
2,"I wanted to like this book, but the pictures are awful.","This is an interesting history of Fiesta, and if that were the whole story, I'd give it 4 or maybe 5 stars. But every single picture is so much darker than the color of the dish it is supposed to represent, it's nearly useless as a guide to collecting Post 86 Fiesta. I don't know how anyone could have approved this book for publication.Please come back with an up-to-date edition with new photos of everything. I'd buy that book in a heartbeat."
3,nice,"At first I wasn't too sure about this burner. The candle is real far from the oil container, but when I used it it really did work. :) I like the design and how the candle light goes through the glass design. :)The top part (where the oil burns) is made of glass and is easily breakable (I suppose), but it seams sturdy enough."
1,DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!,"I am an amateur magicican and I must say this book is lousy at best. This is definately a book that you should judge by its title. (it is actually quite small barely fitting in your hand). As the latter suggests, it is quite difficult to hold on to this book since its really so small in size. As far as the contents, the book does not contain any useful slights. In addition, the tricks are not explained in a whole lot of detail and the pictures don't help at all either. I did learn some tricks which were quite good, but it took considerable time to learn based on the nature of the book. Do yourself a favor and buy Mark Wilson's Complete course in magic."
3,I 've read better for Anne Mather,The description of the places is nice. The story wasn't as good as her others that I've read and that's the only reason why I gave it three stars!
3,Romance and miscommunications,"The setting is Spain, and Cassandra Scott, a widow, and her young son David de Montoya are vacationing at a beach resort near Punta del Lobo. The problem - they are not too far from the town where Cassandra's husband's family live. And too close for comfort is her brother in law, Enrique de Montoya. The tension between them is strong. The past that Cassandra and Enrique want to forget comes flying in their face, and David helps bring it all together. A complex set of circumstances explains the relationship, as David seeks out a family he's never met before.The Spaniard's Seduction was a very well written novel. A good story and a lot of plot twists that will keep any romance fan in suspense!"
2,So silly!,"Anne Mather is a good writer, but the plot of this one was so silly...I didn't believe the heroine could be such a wimpy noodle. You can't explain away why she would marry the hero's brother without telling him what had happened, & how convenient that the brother would then be killed in a car accident. And how many women go along for like, ten years without finding someone new? I'd be so mad at the hero for leaving me I would never want to see him again! But this heroine just wimped along. It was just a waste of my time to read this one."
3,Loved the book... not the shipping,We got this book for my son's high school French class. When we purchased it we were told that we would have expedited shipping. That didn't happen. Just be careful when you buy in case it might be shipped from outside the U.S.
2,Errors,There are errors in the translation making it hard to understand details. Chapter 4 verses 1 and 2 is one example. Be sure to use online resourses to double check confusing passages. When translated correctly the Book of Jubilees is a tremendous blessing from Above.
1,Order R:H. Charles version,"This one is nothing like R.H Charles well written, timelined book. Had to reorder.Dsjdehn hds edswhuj wshuj swui. E"
4,Good job,Lumpkin does a good job with this book. It is a very good tool to have handy when you study Holy Scripture.
2,Less than I expected.,"I expected the product to be in a little better condition. The binding is somewhat frayed. The bottom front cover has a permanent triangular crease. The beginning chapters are excessively highlighted in yellow and underlined. Although many of the other chapters are not quite as distracting the person changed the highlighting to pink and blue. Since the paperback is somewhat thick it seems some of the pages are separating from the back binding especially from the begining to the middle sections. Overall the book is useable but if I want to sell it I would not feel good about giving it a good rating. I would rate it fair. One thing I would say is it beats paying the hardcover price and it will definetly serve it purpose for class.So I will say thanks to the seller.Best Regards,Somewhat Satisfied"
1,don't buy,The game would only work for a one month trial period. Returned for a replacement and that one did the same thing (worked only for one month as a trial period) Finally had to get a refund
1,Big Disappointment,"My wife and I played the free demo game online and loved it from day one,so when i saw it for sale for $13.94 I jumped on it. The delivery was really fast,BookWorm was delivered within two days,My wife and I were really excited and ready two play,opened the packaging, popped in the disk and nothing happened ,I mean absolutely nothing,they sent me a blank disc. EACH ONE TEACH ONE. I just learned the hard way so you should'nt have to,Dont Order This Product, They're selling blank discs. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!!"
1,Corrupt cds,We ordered this game because we played the demo and it is very fun and educational but the cd that was sent was corrupt and had nothing copied on it. We sent it back to amazon and they quickly sent another cd. That one was the same way...no data at all. Amazon refunded our money but it is real diappointing not to have this game.
1,..,I ordered the wrong game and didnt bother to send it back because with the shipping costs both ways it wasnt worth it!
2,Its OK for adults...,I found this game a bit limiting if your a Scrabble enthusiast etc.. Great for kids..
1,Bad CD copies,"We ordered this CD with good intentions and the first copy came lacking any data. Checked for files and non exist. Called customer service who were very nice and they sent another CD. Opened up the second shipment, same thing happened, no data, corrupt CD. DO NOT ORDER this item until the vendor corrects the program CDs. We have asked for our money back and have given up on this one"
4,fun for children and adults,"This game is great fun for children and grown-ups alike. A bit addictive, too, as users try to link letters together to form words. One useful improvement would be to provide definitions of all the acceptable words; the game currently defines only a few words of its own choosing. Otherwise, the game is great fun."
5,Bookworm Delux!,Bookworm is a wonderful learning game. I learn a lot of new words every time I play. A great game for kids and adults. A worthy buy at a reasonable cost.
2,Bookworm review,I liked the game but you can't open the game to full screen. That is really not cool. I would like to enjoy the game full screen.
5,The Asma'Ul-Husna:The 99 Beautiful Names of God,This books transmits to the reader the depth of the beautiful names of God. There are other books out that have the same theme but the explanation of this book could of only come from that One. A source of daily prayer and inspiration no matter your what your belief system or religion is. Alhumdullilah - All Praise is to God
1,Dubravka Tomsic never recorded the 14 waltzes!,"In a recent conversation with Miss Tomsic, she stated that she has never recorded Chopin's 14 waltzes. The German company which produced this CD is using her great name erroneously. Whoever the artist is, he or she is competent at best, but definitely not Dubravka Tomsic. On a another matter, Miss Tomsic has recorded Chopin's First Concerto and it is available. But, record companies are selling two versions. One is her and the other is not. Both are labeled ""Dubravka Tomsic."" Feel free to contact me at the Monterey Symphony for additional information. Joseph Truskot, executive director, Monterey Symphony."
2,ravioli pan,I was not impressed with this pan at all. It was too small. Great and fast service and I appreciate that very much.
4,Straight Forward,"I am pleased with these mounts aside from missing some hardware. There are multiple installation options: flush wall, adjustable wall, adjustable ceiling, adjustable ceiling with extension.Installation was a breeze, but more work than you might expect. The drywall mounting requires drywall anchors, so a 1/4 or 5/16 hole needs to be drilled for each anchor which is then secured with a phillips screw driver. Other than that, the mounts are tightened in place with the included alen wrench. There are options for M5 threaded speakers or keyhole mounted speakers.As for the missing hardware, I'm glad I had an extra drywall anchor and M5 bolt as my set was missing one of each, and is the reason I give this set 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Very good budget speaker mounts.,"They are exactly as promised and were easy enough to mount and use. Have a pair ceiling mounted for my rear surround speakers and they are doing fine. They included hardware was all I needed, plus my cordless drill. The swivel mounts tighten up good and I have not seen any slippage for the speakers (4 lbs each). The speakers use keyhole mounting and the setup for these does not tighten up as much as I would like but it does does OK. I wanted white mounts to be unobtrusive, which they are. The construction is not flimsy at all. Have ordered ordered three more sets for another setup I am helping with."
3,SPEAKER MOUNTS,"HAD TO RETURN, WASN'T THE TYPE OF MOUNTS I NEEDED FOR THE SPEAKERS I HAD PURCHASED. THEY WERE WELL MADE, WISH I COULD HAVE USED THEM."
3,Check the quantity,This product contains 2 mounts in each box although it doesn't mention that on the site. I ended up with twice as many mounts as I needed. Actual product seems adequate.
1,S. Main 5 stars / P. Tong 1 star,"I found this CD to be one great and one part a disaster. I love Pete and I have seen him in concert numberous times, which he is brilliant time and time again, and I have Pete Tong's Esential Mix (outstanding)but I have to say this MIX is a disaster. I was so dissapointed and at the end I didn't know what to make of it. It's definitely not a PACHA sound! Believe me when I tell you, you could not get the crowd going at PACHA IBIZA with this kind of mix. The mix is flawed in so many ways. For one the track Summer Moon mixed into this mix is so out of place. Doesn't do it for me.On the other hand Sarah Main Rocked it! The fact she dropped Kerri Chandler as her opening track set the tone for what to come. A great 5 star mix and she definitely captured the PACHA sound. All I can say is that this is one worth getting solely for Sarah's Mix. She hardly ever comes out with a mix cd so this is real treat for fans."
2,Wanted to be a movie script - but even fails at that,"This book is a poor attempt at its genre. Nothing gets developed, and characters often make no sense. It isn't worth the money."
1,Poor combo of submarine adventure and mysticism,"Henrick was OK as a author of submarine adventure stories. However, in this one, he mixes in poor psuedo-science-fiction and mysticism. Would you believe the soviets have a weapon that will ""teleport"" a submarine 3000 miles while moving the crew ""to another galaxy""? How about a ""crystal capstone""? Stay away from this one! Bill Russell"
1,"Badly designed, poorly made.","I bought one of these from another online site (not Amazon) because I thought it looked great. When it arrived, I discovered it was very poorly made. The lamp tilted slightly to one side and would have to be shimmed underneath to stand straight. Worse yet, the socket sits so high in the shade, that anything but a 25w bulb is visible above the shade. With a 40w or 60w bulb, or heaven forbid, the 100w it supposedly can handle, the bulb can be seen sticking up, looking ridiculous and causing a glare. Send your Chinese designers back to the drawing board, Mr. Minka, and send your craftsmen back to metal shop."
5,A history of Toronto and of Urban Planning in general.,"Ever wonder why Toronto is designed the way it is? This book gives you a thorough explanation that's easy to follow. Through former Toronto mayor John Sewell's effective writing, you will see the evolution of Urban Planning throughout his history of Toronto, and you will get a clear picture of where we are going, and where we ought to be going."
2,Boring and senseless,"I was shocked as I tried to google what the meaning of this story was- that this book was made into a movie. Are you kidding!? OK so I gave it 2 stars because I thought the writing itself was good. The story however was completely baffling and didn't make any sense. We are teased along hoping to find out the mystery behind this beautiful woman who won't disclose her past only to be thrown into confusion and frustration about what happened. I felt ripped-off spending so much time on an over-all boring book waiting, waiting, waiting for something to be revealed or explained only to discover nothing is explained. FRUSTRATING."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"ESP China boy finds non-mundane girl.A guy that deals in porcelain and the like is amazed to find someone he thinks is an ideal woman. Given this is a horror novel or ghost story or whatever you want to call it, he soon learns that she really isn't. He has a bit of the old esp, which is probably not to his benefit in the whole thing. It also has a very dodgy ending."
3,"A good horror novel, a boring love story.","As a horror novel, this book functions well enough; Adams knows how to build the thrill, the plot is original enough and I rather liked the ending. It's not so very horrifying, even King has done it better, but you get something out of it, if you're into horror.However, the love story seemed to me kind of dull. It was so very middle-class and polished, and it didn't seem realistic at all. Also the love scenes were boring to read, since there were no edge, no feel of reality. Just repetition of sweet but empty words. This side of the book drags it somewhat down, but doesn't make it a disaster. At least, the writing style is great."
4,It was good,"Both the hero and herion had issues about staying in Hart's Harbor. They both thought their duty lied elsewhere. Yet, the last thing either wanted was to date. He had lost his wife and daughter in a car accident. She felt she was called to be a misisonary, and blamed her parents for keeping her from it.There was nothing earth shattering or really no adventure in this book, yet watching the two come together was pretty sweet."
3,"Good book, bad downloaded examples","The book is excellent, however, the downloaded program files used in the examples rarely work. That's what keeps me from giving this book 5 stars."
2,May be a good reference but don't purchase to learn VB,I purchased this book to learn programming in a visual environment. I have not programmed since I took some courses back in college programming on a main frame. There are many typos in this book and the code Does not work in many of sections. I am trying to learn by following along with the code in the book and get hit with many errors. When you look at the code from the web site it is completely different from what he has in the book which is taking huge amounts of time to figure out what he has done. I would not refer this book to anyone trying to learn the language.
3,OK Entry Level,"This book provided good entry level coverage of the VB2005 language. I found it a little on the elementary side as I am a very experienced programmer in VC++. If you are just learning to program in VB or are just beginning to code in an Object Oriented environment than this books would be an OK book to buy. However, for beginning programmers I always reccommend ""Deietl"" books for the very structured system of teaching you programming concepts.If you are an experience OO programmer in another language (VC++ or Java) looking to bring those skills into the VB2005 language then I don't reccommend this book. I highly reccommend ""Visual Basic 2005 : The Language"" as it covers the more advanced features and methods available and is a great reference to learn VB."
5,Belongs in your reference collection,"I borrowed this first from the public library, then I recommended it to my boss and we ordered several copies. Covers a vast scope of applications. I haven't been thru the complete book (almost 1400 pages) but every time I have looked up topics, it has been helpful. It stays off the shelf and on my desk most of the time."
5,excellent compilation,"a great all-around authentic selection of crucial early roots/country reggae bangers and more uptownish middle of the road pop-oriented singles by the likes of Pluto Shervington and Ken Boothe that were nonetheless big hits in Jamaica during the 70's. the mastering is excellent, you'll likely never hear any of these tunes any better, and certainly not if you own them on old mashed up 45's. for those looking for deep dark apocalyptic roots or dub, you'll want to look elsewhere. if i had any complaint at all, it might be for the inclusion of the kinda lightweight hotel-poolside foreigner pleaser ""Boogie Bump"" being included - but this comp makes up for it with his juggernaut hit ""Ramgoat Liver"" and the very un-Plutolike badman rouser ""I Man Bitter"". if you were living in JA during the 70's, many of these songs will have some kind of resonance."
2,Not To well thought out,"yea i saw this unique controller and got it just to have an extra controller, when i finaly get it out of the box and put my hands on it i realised how uncomfortable it felt, the bar that conects the handgrips just gets in the way. so if you have big hands i would not recomend this controler"
5,Multiplex 5x5 Karaoke CDG with Guide Vocal Tracks,"PRIDDIS Multiplex 5X5 AVRIL LAVIGNE Karaoke CD&G CD from the High Quality PRIDDIS PRO SOUND POP/ROCK collection (1498G), This factory manufactured CD comes in a plastic jewel case, plays the music with or without the lead vocals and displays the lyrics on a Karaoke CD&G player. There is also a printed lyrics booklet included so you can use this disk even if you don't have a karaoke player. This CD has 10 tracks total. The first 5 are without vocals and the second 5 are the same songs with guide vocals in one channel for practice purposes. These songs are not preformed by the original artists but are VERY GOOD re-creations."
4,A must have!,"It is nothing short of tragic that this book is out of print. I borrowed it from the library years ago, and have wanted to own it ever since. Busbee knows how to keep her readers on the edge of their seats in breathless anticipation. She paints her scenery vividly in the minds of her audience, and her characters come to life on the page. Definitely worth reading!"
1,Better Inca book,"Anyone who wishes to read a better novel about the Incas might want to try 'The Incas' by Daniel Peters - more action, better characterization, less soppy romantic cliche."
3,"Great light, but expensive batteries!","This is a great light in form and function - perfect size to clip to my pocket, easy push-button opperation, and bright!But bright when the batteries are new. The manufactuerer claims a 40 hour battery life, but in my two years of ownership I have found that this is simply not true. I get maybe 2 hours of useable light before the LED just glows weakly. If this flashlight used AA's, then this wouldn't be a problem. The problem is that it uses CR123 batteries, which costs $16+ for a pair! 6 hours worth of batteries costs more than the dang flashlight does!I usually love Pelican products for their high quality, but sorry, I would not recommend this light and I will not buy it again."
4,Well worth the money,After watching the demo on their web site. i placed an order and was pleasantly surprised. it performs as advertised. i am using it as a repository for network documentation.
5,"Notebook software, for Mac","I love this software!!!very helpful, and easy to use. a great organizer.Great job on this soft ware."
3,I would go with other books,"This book was okay, but I spend my time on other books that I find more useful. I didn't spend much time on this one, but have just about worn out other books like Baby 411 and the Nursing Mother's Companion. Another favorite is Playful Parenting."
5,One of my favorites.,"This has to be my favorite anime. I just recently watched it, and had to watch it again. I can honestly say i have never watched an anime, and wanted to watch it again so soon after the first viewing. I see another gay man disliked Junjou Romantica, talking of rape. Yes, in the beginning Akihiko forced himself on Misaki, but he really didnt put up much of a fight, and if you watch it the whole way through, he really regrets what he did. Speaking from past experience, I also did things that i wasn't really ready to do, but went along with it. Most of us, like Misaki, were young, confused, and unsure of ourselves at one point in our life.I like to look at the anime as a whole, it has its darker moments, but the budding romance between the two, with some comedy, and drama, I think it is one of the best i have seen to date. I would recommend it to anyone, and have to my friends."
4,enjoyed,"A bit more disjointed than the first season, but I still enjoyed it. it's worth watching if you enjoyed the first season."
1,disappointing,"This book does not contain the high quality of writing as other Cather books, such as Death of the Archbishop, My Antonia."
4,a nice sample of Karie,"If you have the money to spend on Japanese singles in addition to full-length albums, this one's not a bad buy. ""Fruit Paradise"" is a perfect example of everything that's charming about Kahimi Karie, and the Towa Tei remix of ""Superfreak"" (track 2) is definitely worth a listen. The only track that's lacking is ""David Hamilton,"" which is slow in a way I find boring, but others might find atmospheric."
4,Tracklisting,1. Fruit Paradise2. Superfreak (Sweet Robots Remix)3. David Hamilton (St Etienne Remix)4. Superfreak (Sweet Robots Reprise)Sweet Robots is Towa Tei
1,"waste of money, more importantly waste of time",I really think that this book spends entirely too much time on stories. The stories were boring and I related to none of them.This book just made me feel more organized than ever and that I was totally wasting my time.You have to weed through a lot of useless stories about unorganized people to get to any solutions. Totally wouldn't buy again. I'm taking it to my local half price book store. Look for it there.
3,just ok,The book is based on stories from the authors clients. It was ok but I was getting bored with all the stories.
1,HARD TO READ,"THIS BOOK WAS VERY BORING AND HARD TO READ!! I WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS QUICK AND EASY TO DO IN BETWEEN FAMILY DEMANDS, BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE WITH THIS BOOK. IF YOU HAVE LOADS OF TIME, THEN YOU CAN USE THIS BOOK. I DON'T"
1,"well, at least it was only $4","I bought this disk as it was an Amazon recommendation after purchasing another disk.Such wonderful music, but such a questionable chorus. The primary problem is a vibrato in the tenor section that is beautifully appropriate for Pucinni but essentially ruins these performances. It's a shame as there is some good work happening in the direction, but overall, the performance never quite gets better than a good church choir."
1,To paraphrase Ambrose Bierce...,"...the problem with this CD is that the beginning and the ending are much too far apart.For all the reasons mentioned by other reviewers, this performance is painful to listen to; the CD shouldn't have been pressed."
1,What a disappointment!,"I bought this CD as I remember listening to Josquin Desprez and Palestrina when I took a music history class years ago, and absolutely loved their music. From the first track on, though, it was a painful experience. The choral sound was heavy and romanticized with obvious vibrato, and then there was that annoying trumpet doubling on the melody!! I had hoped that this recording would bring back the mysterious beauty and simplicity of these pieces, as they were intended to be performed, but this CD was a major disappointment."
1,Hate it,"Damage when it came, kids wasn't happy at all. Please Don't buy it at all its a waste of money."
3,"Good, not Excellent","I bought this for my two year old grandson. So far he is enjoying using these with his dump truck. On the plus side is the wooden cart which seems to be fun for putting the blocks back in after dumping. Education-wise, the blocks have pictures that do not begin with the alphabet letter on the other side of the block. Also, having only been used two or three times, I noticed the paint is already chipping off the corners of the blocks. All in all it is still a good toy and most likely worth the money because of the durability of the wood and the whimsy of the little cart, if you don't mind explaining why grapes are on the block that says ""B""."
4,Smaller than expected,"I love Melissa & Doug products, and these blocks are made with the same high quality that I have come to expect from their toys. My only problem with the blocks is that they are a lot smaller than I was expecting. They are only about 1 cubic inch each. It really is not a problem - I was just expecting them to be bigger."
3,"Son loves it, but it's frustrating and small.","I ordered this for my son after he played with a similar toy at a playdate and loved it. But the one from the playdate was larger and had a much longer string. My son (18 months) really loves pulling this around, but because the string is so short, it gets flipped over a lot and then he gets frustrated with it. He also likes the blocks, but they are small and sharp on some edges. 2 were chipped when the product arrived."
4,good!,My 13 month old daughter enjoyed stacking the blocks on top of each other & knocking em down. Kept her busy!
3,Smaller than I thought.,"I opened this when I received it, but have not let my 17 month old nephew open it. The blocks are smaller than I thought they would be. He is still into throwing things and these seem like they could be dangerous at this stage. Going to give it a few months before I allow him to have this one."
3,"Good, but...","Blocks are smaller than we expected, and the paint is already chipping off the corners. Our child still uses them just fine, just thought they'd have more longevity..."
3,Quite Small,"I just want to bring this up because you really can't see the size from the pictures. So read the detail and find out if you truly like the small size of them. There are bigger, of course a bit more expensive blocks out there too and they fit my baby better, I think."
4,"Smaller than I thought, but still fun for my daughter!","When purchasing this item, I thought the wagon would be a little bit bigger. My daughter still has fun with it though. It is real wood which is nice, and the blocks are a great learning tool. Overall, it is a great value, and fun, but I still wish it was a little bigger."
2,Educational yet Painful,My son loves to stack these blocks and sort by color. At a younger age (2yrs) he just liked pulling the wagon around the room. Now he identifies the picture and letters.The drawback is that the edges are not rounded. If you are one of those people that clean up after each use then this may not be an issue. In my house they became little landmines across our living room. At a random moment my husband or I would step on them with bare feet and curse my mother for giving us the blocks. They are incredibly painful! Someone else mentioned their child being cut by them. That was not the case for us but I could see how they would be too sharp for a teether who may try to gum down on them.I would recommend looking elsewhere for building blocks.
5,I love these blocks!,"I have had this product for about 6-months. It is a great toy for parent/child interaction. We sit on the floor and identify the colors, animals, etc. The blocks stack well, and my two-year old son gets a kick out of dumping from the wagon and then putting them back in, he also loves to pull it around. It is one of his favorite toys. I marked it down slightly for durability, because, as other reviewers have commented, the paint does tend to come off when the kids ""mouth"" these. I have not found the edges to be a hazard. As I mentioned, we've had this toy for several months, and despite close to daily use, we've experienced no injuries or complaints (although, I do make sure they are picked up every night, because I wouldn't want to step on one in the dark). Overall, I highly recommend this product."
3,Blocks are sharp,"I bought the same sharp blocks at Target for $1.00 in their dollar area. I thought Melissa and Doug would have safer blocks so a disappointment to see the same quality, but kids still like blocks, just don't step on them!"
3,Classic wooden blocks,"We all had these as kids, and these are fine, although picking them up each day isn't much fun, nor is stepping on them with bare feet."
1,Dangerous. Do Not Buy!,The corners of the blocks are very sharp. Dangerous for kids. I returned it immediately. Buy it if you want to see your kid's face covered with lots of cuts.
5,Great gift that grows with child,"My daughter received these blocks as a gift when she was about ten months old. At that point, they were nice because they were just the right size for her hands. While they are on the small side, I never worried about choking because she played with them while I was watching and she wasn't interested in mouthing them. Even if she had put them in her mouth, though, I don't think she could have gotten it in all the way.She has continued to enjoy the blocks and now, at almost three years old, can spend long chunks of time making ""trains"" and towers with them. They been great for developing her fine motor skills and for teaching vocabulary and letters. When other children play at our house, they often end up working with these blocks as well.I recommend these blocks as an affordable gift that will get years of use."
3,Kinda shotty,"Overall the toy is a good idea. My daughter loved the blocks, and dragging them here and there so she could stack them. However the blocks 'fray' at the edges and seem a little dangerous for a toddler should they become easy to shred. Also I find it weird that NONE of the lettered blocks have images that match the letter. How is that educational?"
5,Great classic toy!,I love all of the Melissa & Doug toys. You can not beat the quality for the price. These toys will stand the test of time.
3,Blocks smaller than expected,"The blocks were pretty small, so we ended up just selling to a neighbor and buying a new set. I liked the little cart though."
3,block cart,"It is a nice product, colorful and the cart is nice. It is smaller than it appears, should have read the description better."
2,Very disappointed.. These blocks are tiny!!,"I bought this set for my grandson thinking it would like the ones my own children played with but was very disappointed when they arrived. Each block is so small...half the original size they used to be, that my grandson; a toddler, had a hard time stacking and playing with them. TSK@@@!!! Too bad. They are certainly cute and are replicas of the alphabet blocks we used to have, but way too small for little hands to play with. I put them away for when he is older and can better manipulate such small blocks. Right now, i am on the search for those same-sized blocks i was looking for originally."
3,"Baby's favorite toy, but chips.","This has become our son's favorite toy to play with. He is 10 months old and loves pulling the cart towards him, hitting the blocks together, and mouthing the blocks. I gave the toy 5 stars for ""fun"".As a mother though, I found the block's edges way too sharp. I had to sand each block down which took at least 30 min with sand paper to smoothen down the sharp edges and points. This should have been done by the toy manufacturer. Also 2 days after we received the blocks, i found some wood on our floor that sheared off one of the blocks, which could have been a choking hazard.If i were to buy them again though, I would, just because my son has so much fun with them. The manufacturer should take some time to make the block safer for children though."
3,"skip the wagon, just get the blocks","Due to strangulation concerns I'm sure, the pull on the wagon is so short my son has always had to bend down to pull it. It also is difficult and awkward to store even though it isn't that large, though i don't have the best storage set up, so that might just be my problem! The blocks stack well and look nice. We've done away with the wagon."
1,Review by grandparent,"I ordered this toy for my grandaughter because it is advertised as ""Classie ABC Block Cart"" My children had a block wagon and I was expecting something similar. This toy is haft the size of the original block set sold in the 70's. The wheels are plastic. The blocks are very small and could be a chocking hazard. This toy is going back tomorrow, unopened."
1,Choking hazard and badly made in China,Shame on Doug & Melissa! Stop making junk in China for our kids! If you can afford such a wonderous mansion you can afford to have the toys made in the U.S. by American citizens with American materials for American kids!
4,My boys love it!,"We got this for our 2.5 year old son and our 7 month old son for Christmas last month. They absolutely love it! My 2 year old walks around the house with the wagon whether the blocks are in or not, he loves to ask me what the different pictures are, the colors on the letters/numbers etc. and loves to stack the blocks into different things. The 7 month old loves to hold the blocks and suck on them :)The wagon itself appears a tad flimsy but it is holding up really well so far! I just don't know how well it would take being thrown across the room if that ever happened..The blocks/wagon got here in a timely manner wrapped in plastic..nothing wrong with it at all.Great little toy, we love our purchase!"
4,A great gift,"We actually gave this as a gift, but I love Melissa and Doug products. I think this toy will be around for quite some time. It reminded me of a block set that I had as a child, so how can you go wrong with such a classic toy?"
4,Cute design,My daughter loves the little wagon the blocks come in. I don't necessarily like the way they placed all of the letters (certain letters always have other certain letters on the same block making it difficult to spell certain words) but they're still lots of fun.
5,Great,My 2 yr old loved it. She started pulling the toy right away. She loved the blocks and started trying to put them together. It's still one of her favorite toys and it's been about a month since she got them.
2,Searching for the Perfect Beat,I found the flyers to be generic. Not as hardcore as would have hoped for.
5,"COOL, its like a shoppers guide for finding good designers","The book was a really good view on the progression of flyer designs during the 1990s. It presented us with the big names in design, and a bunch of the smaller ones... Thanks for putting the contact info at the bottom"
4,sumptuous beats,a delightful visual feast that gives even more luminescent life to the spectacular scene. One realizes the depth of talent out there and the huge amount of energy devoted to the self-empowered/community conscious/psychedelic recreational realms.Many of these flyers are true works of art into which one can happily immerse their mind and survey the flavors of forbidden fruits.
1,what a terrible book,"Honestly, what are people thinking giving this book such good reviews. I used to do flyers for a living... if i had submitted half of these I would been laughed at. They are all bubble gum generic, half-a$$ed, and uninspirational. I should add not creative either. This book is just plain terrible. I bought it 3 years ago, and it was dated then... I think I am going to just throw my copy away. Don't buy this book!"
1,RIP OFF!!!!!,BEWARE that this DVD is only 10 minutes long. It is misleading and a WASTE of money. It is obvious what the Russsians and the people who make an market this DVD are up to.
2,Video,"knew the movie was short, but the highlight of the Catherine Palace, The Amber Room, was barely peeped at."
5,One of the funnest games ever,"Worms Armageddon has 2d graphics and is a very good strategy game, although it may look simple it is actually very deep and the graphics are actually quite good compared to most titles. Even when you know nothing about this game it is still a lot of fun and once you get to know most of the weapons it is a blast! A must buy for any gamer!"
4,"Wise, witty, wonderful...","Wise, witty, wonderful music by the only German talented enough to become a British Pop Star, for a generous organist & her/his hip band.1 . Rodelinda, HWV 19: OvertureConductor: Lizzio, AlbertoEnsemble: Camerata Romana2 . Concerto for Organ, Op. 4: no 1 in G minor, HWV 2893 . Concerto for Organ, Op. 4: no 4 in F major, HWV 2924 . Concerto for Organ in F major, HWV 295 ""Cuckoo and the Nightingale""Conductor: Hlinka, GeorgEnsemble: Munich Chamber Orchestra"
3,Too Few Components,"This is a good educational tool, but it lacks the components to be really fun. It has plenty of devices, but not enought to really expand what you can try. Grandson (age 6 years) tried experiments for about 30 minutes first time out. Maybe next visit we will get more."
1,It is not a review rather a complaint waiting to be addressed!!,I need you to know that the package has no bulbs so the first project itself is not possible as also the two top slots on the LHS rae vacant though you donot mention any code numbers so they may be meant to be empty only. BUT THE BULBS ARE NOT IN THE SLOT WHICH MENTIONS THE BULBS???PLEASE SEND ME THE BULBS IMMEDIATELY!!
5,This toy will develop an gut feel for electronics.,"Electronics is art. An artist needs to have gut feel for his/her art. This set will develop the gut feel for how circuits work and how to create circuits.I wished that I had a set like this to play with when I was in middle school and high school. It would have impacted how I studied electrical engineering in college. In college one learns the theory and the math equations for circuits in such a fast pace that there isn't really time to digest the information and day dream about circuits. It is absolutely important to invest a few years on this set to develop that gut feel for electronics.Doing each project in this kit, one should ask ""what is this circuit doing? Why does it do what it's doing? Can I visualize how the electricity is flowing through the circuit?""Explanations on the student handbook is excellent.Parts are well built. The case is solid."
1,Splash Guard,The guard is a bit curved and doesn't sit flush to the wall at all. The bottom part sticks to the wall but the top is completely off the wall with almost half an inch of gap. I would give it 5 stars if this would adhere to the wall completely.
3,"Light fare at ""The World Cafe""","There's a bottom line to this book: it's on pp. 171-173. There, we find out what a ""world cafe"" meeting is and what's involved in putting one on. Everything else in this book is what I would call HYPE--promotional ""bearing witness,"" as if this process had some kind of holy, earth-shaking significance. It IS a positive thing, but it's not that positive. There are lots of other meeting processes that are just as effective at drawing out ideas. And besides, the book needs a lot more HOW-TO. Maybe the authors want you to call on them to do it for you. For a fee, of course. Nevertheless, if you absolutely NEED TO KNOW what world cafe is all about, you'll probably have to buy this book, which is, as far as I know, the only one written about it."
3,A Great Idea that Needs a Better Book,"This is an incredibly hard book for me to review. As with some other business books I've read in the past, I think the ideas are good and useful. On the other hand, despite its deceptively friendly appearance, I find this an incredibly difficult book to read.My main complaint is simple and, again, commonplace among books of this type: it is entirely too long for what it is trying to achieve. This is a two hundred-plus page book that could have easily accomplished its purpose in thirty pages. It is bulked up by vagueness, repetitiveness and numerous personal anecdotes that are only occasionally useful. With much more direct and succinct writing, the authors could have given us a clearer picture of how to make the world cafe process unfold.Still, it needs be said that the world cafe idea is a good one. I've used it a few times in meetings and it has always been successful. If you're looking for what the world cafe is about, this is the place."
5,Eat this book!,"Short of simply eating this book, in hopes that all the knowledge, wisdom and experience it contains might magically be transformed from ingested paper and ink into my very own Café knowledge, wisdom and skills, the next best strategy is to read it. I continue to be amazed and grateful at how much useful information it contains, and how helpful it is in my own Cafe design and facilitation."
5,Conversation at its very best,"Ten years' worth of collective wisdom around conversation at its very best-that's what this book contains. Brown and her colleagues offer their stories and insights as a gift to the world at a time when we all need, desperately, to listen to each other and to honor and learn from each other's points of view. Raising questions that matter to us all and sitting around small café tables for real talk just might change the world. It's worth a try. It's worth a read."
3,Your mileage may vary,"The theories and philosophical principles of The World Cafe are sound and powerful. What is not explored in this book--and should be--are the inconsistent results of what is promoted.Yes, the Cafe experience can be transformative. It can also be boring, despite what Meg Wheatley says. It can also be quite unpleasant and negative. The book appears to present only the success stories as if no other type of story could be found.The book does lack (as another reviewer has noticed) practical ""how to"" information. The information that is provided does not guide a practitioner sufficiently to use the Cafe method."
3,World Cafe: An Introduction,This book gives a nice overview of World Cafe's. Good introductory text. This is really a book about setting the stage for good conversations that are meaningful and productive.
5,DINOMORPHS,Fun toy for my little grandson bright colors and interesting ! He loves puzzles and to build things. Great idea for a little guy
2,Boring. Not as Expected,"There are four dinosaurs with multiple parts and you snap them together in different ways. My son (age 3.5) played with it for about 10 minutes and then moved onto something else and hasn't played with it again. I guess if we had lots of sets it might be more fun but at $20 a set, there are plenty of other toys that I would purchase instead of this one. And, unless you use the correct pieces, the dinosaurs don't stand up well, which doesn't lend itself to much pretend play. The toy looks pretty dinky for the price. Our older child also was not interested in this toy, so I don't think it was an age issue."
4,From a knowlegable toy fan.,These are two great figures made by a great company. They have little articulation but they are made to display. In that respect I must say that these are the best offered in the paint department. I have the whole set and if you like to display these are must have.
3,Nostalgia,"I loved being able to play monopoly the easy way but there is one problem, it gets hung up or freezes and u have to restart the game."
4,Monopoly for the Millenium,"I think this game is great! You get all the joys of Monopoly without the hassle of counting the paper money. I play this at my cousins' house and we have a blast. The characters are adorable, the directions are very clear, and you can type your own name in so you always know who's turn it is. I think it is really a super game that the whole family can enjoy!"
3,Enjoyable light mystery,"If this is the same book as the one published by Elizabeth Peters back in 1973 with the title 'Borrower of the Night', it's an entertaining book with a strong female character."
4,COULD NOT PUT THIS SERIES DOWN!!!,"Elizabeth Peters books are fun, comical, gripping mysteries -- read them all!Vicky is different from Amelia Peabody (she's tall, 20something, and a blonde bombshell with curves). Peters' spends a lot of time trying to establish this new character, and Vicky's figure/views are mentioned a lot at first (which turned my mom off of it initially), but it gets better.==>> Why read this book? BECAUSE THE SEQUELS ARE PHENOMENAL!! <<==I COULD NOT put the 2ND BOOK DOWN (Street of the 5 Moons), and when I was done I immediately drove to the library for the rest. I even skipped the 3rd book (because the library didn't have it) because I was ABSOLUTELY HOOKED, and the 4th and 5th were so good I didn't get any sleep! I don't feel bad about skipping the 3rd book, but I'm certainly glad I read this 1st one to get established. Don't pass up this series!!!"
2,"Fun book, TERRIBLE reading","I saw an earlier review that complimented Barbara Rosenblat's reading of this book for its German pronunciations. Unfortunately, the version I got was read by Susan O'Malley, who seems to have no knowledge of German and no interest in learning any. What started as a minor annoyance (""RAWthenberg,"" ""GROFFin"" for Graefin, ""Groose"" Gott) reached the point of obscuring meaning when Ms. O'Malley read the German word Feuer as if it were spelled Fuehrer. Fire, not leader; it's important to the plot. It might not annoy people who aren't familiar with the way the words are actually pronounced, but don't try out any German phrases based on anything you hear in this audiobook.The book itself is fun but has not aged well, and Vicky's 1980s-era feminism feels almost quaint."
3,Vicky is no Amelia,"This book was enjoyable - compared to many other authors, it was excellent, but compared to Peters's other works, it is merely good. I've been hooked on the Amelia Peabody series for years, and in my opinion this isn't quite as good as those books. The characters aren't as well developed, and the plot didn't grip me - I didn't feel the usual urgency to find out what would happen right away. However, it's still a fun adventure and full of the wit I've come to expect from Peters. I would recommend this to anyone who knows and loves Elizabeth Peters, but newbies should start with Crocodile on the Sandbank or another of Amelia's exploits."
2,"Vicky, Vaa-Vaa Voom!","Peters is a master of this type of book. She really is, but this one fails to deliver of that promise. This book introduces us to a very shapely heroine, but still a very smart heroine, as well the supporting cast. The problem with the book lies in the fact that the main character is forced to play second fiddle to a bunch of second-rate talent. This makes for a less than thrilling book. It simply becomes a book that does not have much to offer other than a fairly predictable plot and boring characters. All in all, not one of Peter's best efforts."
4,Must-read for SAP implementations,This book provides a detailed blueprint for the implementation of standard software. It is well-researched and highly structured. If you are embarking on a standard software project you should make sure that all your team members read chapter 3. It gives an excellent overview about the issues from strategy to implementation.
1,Written to appear to be a scholarly work.,"The constant citing of references in text, instead of placing them in footnotes, makes the book very difficult to read. The author is also bent on being academic to the extreme. For example, he wastes considerable print (and the reader's time) on the definition of software and systems. Technically the book does have some merit in covering the principles and practice of installing Standard Software (ERP) but these points of illumination are far to hard find and nearly impossible to understand in this writing."
5,Fantastic book for learning about wine,"As a wine reviewer, I find this book to be a great resource. I constantly refer to the book to increase my knowledge and understanding of wines, regions and varietals. This is absolutely my number one resource.This book is great for wine drinkers of all experience levels. The second chapter gives a very good exposure to the vocabulary of wine.I can't think of a single wine-related topic that was left out of this book. It covers grape growing, harvesting, fermentation. There's a section on corkscrews and a section on winery tours. Even the most casual of wine drinkers will find this book to be fascinating and very educational. The writing style is easy to read and light-hearted.I really appreciate the small size of this book - it's only ~6"" X 4"". It's small enough to tuck into a backpack or purse while on a winery tour or vacation.Cheers!"
4,Really gorgeous,These earrings are a gift for the upcoming holidays. I think the person receiving them will really like them.They are a great color and are a nice size. I would totally recommend these.
3,"Great for a migraine, but too heavy","This product works wonderful for migraines, but is just too heavy! I have Fibromyalgia and I found it uncomfortable and I had to return it. It was too heavy for my head and with the Fibro, trying to hold it up made my neck muscles kill!! But, I have other products that are similar and you have to store them carefully! Lay it as flat as you can and in the same way it came. I put mine in 2 ziplock bags to prevent any freezer smells and then I put that in Tupperware. Be very careful with the Velcro!! It will stick to the spandex type material and fray it. Check out all the other products, they have everything for every muscle group! This is worth the money as long as you intend on taking good care of it and have a really strong neck! Customer service for these guys is great also!"
1,Bad fit,I bought the s/m size and am a female the fit was too large in the lower half of the item. Once you try the item on you are not suppose to return it as the return policy states this is for health code reasons. Furthermore the seller has a hefty restocking fee. After I found out I could not return it I decided to put it in the freezer. I suffer from migraines and found that this cold therapy cap did not help me at all. It does not stay cold long enough. Also it has a seam that runs down the back of the item where your nerves run up your neck. This is one of the areas that needed to be cold. Because of the seam that area is not even covered with the gel. The loose fit of the cap makes this a very useless! I will just stick with my other eye mask products when I feel a migraine come on. Save your money and stay away from this product.
2,Retains heat and cold for maybe 3 minutes,This product is great for the first 3 minus then it gets too cool or hot. I have tried heating it more or cooling it more but it never stays more than about 3 minutes at a usable temperature. What a shame because it feel great for those first 3 minutes and works great.The velcro around the neck hurts and is very tough too.
5,My new favorite book!,I am so happy that there is finally a book about this part of American pop culture that has been largely ignored! I had no idea that so many amazing pictures have survived all these years. The graphics are wonderful and I love all of the logos. Great book.
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"UNLIKE THE OTHER REVIEWERS I FOUND THIS BOOK DISAPPOINTING AT BEST.THE BOOK CONSISTS MERELY OF OLD BROCHURES,PHOTOS AND POSTCARDS WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO ADD INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRAILERS PICTURED. NO DATA ABOUT THE TRAILERS THEMSELVES IS ATTEMPTED.THE BOOK ALSO INCLUDES EARLY MOBILE HOMES AS WELL AS TRAVEL TRAILERS WHICH BELIES THE TITLE.I HAVE SEVERAL OTHER BOOKS ABOUT TRAVEL TRAILERS AND TRAILER CAMPING WHICH ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE.THE AUTHORS APPEAR TO HAVE TAKEN A BUNCH OF OLD STUFF FROM A SHOEBOX AND PUT IT IN BOOK FORM WITH OUT ANY FURTHER EFFORT AT A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY.THE OLD PICTURES ARE INTERESTING BUT MUCH MORE WAS NEEDED TO MAKE THIS BOOK A WORTHY READ.NOT ON MY RECOMMEND LIST."
5,Who would have guessed!,"Wow, what a great book for anyone interested is vintage travel trailers. The original ads for the various makes, the old time post cards, personal black and white photos. And the book encludes a section on ""tear drop"" trailers as well. Very nicely done indeed."
2,Not that interesting,"We just got a travel trailer, so thought this would be an interesting book. But it didn't really have that much to say about the evolution of the travel trailer. Lots of pictures, not much content."
5,Trailers,"I love vintage trailers, and this book is packed with them.. Great imagery, loads of neat information. I recommend for any with interest in vintage trailer travel."
2,Disappointing. A classic it ain't.,"Other reviews -- and the book's intro -- compare it with _Starship Troopers_ as a classic of military sci-fi. Sorry.Clunky writing, an uninteresting plot, and little of the military angle the book is supposed to be famous for make this one to skip (or at best get from the library).Problems are rarely solved; they just disappear. Aside from the beginning, we don't see tactics or strategy. Unlike _Starship Troopers_ we are *told* about a character's evolution rather than seeing it happen. All in all, a weak book."
2,Pointless,"The problem with writing a story about a military genius, is how do you convincing portray such a character without being a military genius yourself. Dickson tries to use the fact that his story is set in a high tech future to disguse the impausibility of his military plans. But even if the reader accepts Donal's strategies as good it's hard to believe no one ever thought of them before.The universe is unrealistic and Dickson treats human societies as if they themselves are individuals. This might work if as individuals they weren't all completely one-dimensional. This is a very simplistic and unsasitisfying book which even fails to work as a simple time-passer do to the clumsy writing and silly characters."
1,Very disappointing,"I was unable to enjoy this either as a literary novel or as an adventure novel or as SF. I'd been led to believe that it was some SF military classic, yet it read like a bad pulp novel. It is depressing that it's presented as classic SF.. this does the genre no good at all and gives it a bad name. Anywhere else this book would be promptly forgotten since it's not particularly well written or interesting and has little or no literary value."
4,This book kicks...derierre,"This book is one of the best finds I've had lately. It really reads quickly, but at the same time, there isn't anything that gets left out. Dickson does a great job of creating his own galactic political system. There are no real gaps in the logic behind it, and it is pretty intricate. Dickson also has established some great characters, although there aren't many that stay throughout the book- Donal, the main character, is a mercenary, and is always somewhere new, with someone new. The ones that do surface more thatn once are well-developed, though. Overall,I must say any one, well, any one who likes sci-fi, should be able to dig this book. Dickson was a great writer, and this book is a true showcase of some genuine talent. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,first of the Childe Cycle....,"....and an impressive start. Those with outsiderish traits may relate to Donal, the soldier/dreamer who can't understand people, yet understands them too well (as the Exotics are aware)."
3,Old Skool Skiffy...which may not be a good thing,"Look, it's not that this is a bad book. The writing's perfectly workmanlike, if a little dense at times, and there's no denying the ideas are huge and interesting. But I think I've been spoiled by writers who realize that their characters have to actually be people. For when it was written, it's a masterpiece; for someone who'd like, say, a woman to be more than a collection of features in a skirt...Not to mention that if I wanted the ""breeding for gods"" trope, I could get it from Dune, where the sexism of the time wouldn't try quite so hard to strangle me. Worth reading, to be sure, but I'm not keeping it around to RE-read."
4,"A good, captivating read","I am on Amazon.com right now because I just finished Dalmas' ""Lion of Farside"" and I am looking for a sequel! Dalmas' protagonist, Curtis Macurdy, is what we all wish we could be when faced with tough, frightening situations: Brave, cool, and smart. His wife is taken to an alternate Earth, and he follows to get her back. Along the way, he is by turns a slave, a swordsman soldier, and a magician. He demonstrates attributes that all of wish we had, if we were in his position. Interpersonal relationships are a bit different in this alternate Earth, and the ending is not what you may expect. Now if I could just find that darn sequal..."
4,"A good read, hard to put down","This book kept me anxiously coming back for more throughout. The plot isn't the most believable: a man forming vast alliances and launching a major war, just because his wife may be in the enemy's country? Despite that, I loved the book. Very original, good character development, positive, lots of gratuitous sex, ... By the way, it can be downloaded free from Baen's website as a teaser to the whole series. It got me hooked."
5,Butterfly/Gossamer Drawer Pulls,I fell in love with the Gossamer Bed set for my baby. I wanted drawer pulls to match her room. When I found these I had to have them. I got them in two days of ordering and they look wonderful on her dresser. They added that little touch that sometimes is very hard to find.
2,Color not as shown,"They look awesome on the website and looked perfect, as I wanted pink for my granddaughter's pink room with a white dresser. But the color was not pink - it was more like a tanish - putty color. If the color had been pink, as shown, I would have been happy, but I was not and returned them."
1,not impressed,"I bought this cam because i was going on vacation to florida, i'm dissappointed with the quality the cam has, very poor, sometimes blurry, doesnt matter what you do with the settings to change it still does the same thing, as to the video quality it's just as poor, the zoom is bad too cause when you zoom in to an object it becomes so dazzled that you can't make out what it is. i will continue to look for a cam online."
5,Multiplex 5x5 Karaoke CDG with Guide Vocal Tracks,"PRIDDIS Multiplex 5X5 FEMALE SMOOTH JAZZ Karaoke CD&G CD from the High Quality PRIDDIS COMBO collection (1716G), This factory manufactured CD comes in a plastic jewel case, plays the music with or without the lead vocals and displays the lyrics on a Karaoke CD&G player. There is also a printed lyrics booklet included so you can use this disk even if you don't have a karaoke player. This CD has 10 tracks total. The first 5 are without vocals and the second 5 are the same songs with guide vocals in one channel for practice purposes. These songs are not preformed by the original artists but are VERY GOOD re-creations."
3,Too much of the same thing,"I bought this on the basis of hearing one number on the radio. The oboe/voice combo is lovely for awhile, but the sound bothered me by the end of the disk."
2,Don't purchase this TV,"This television will die in 3 years. Repairs are expensive. Phillips does nothing knowing the set will be defetive in two to three years when the warranty runs out. This is a complete rip off. Can you image these sent cost more than $1,400 bucks 12/17/2007 Tv stop working 6/29/2011 YOu should Ask about the Power supply and if Phillips will replace it after 5+ years of use. They should recall this TV Too many people with the same red blinking lights after a few years of use.If you have money good Luck, if not don't waste it."
2,There are better books...,"This was a (supposedly) true story; I'm not doubting that it wasn't, but this is more of a religious book, based on faith, than it is a true biography. This book is 80% dialogue and therefore not very descriptive of the daily events. It's simply not what I thought it was. A better read is Scheisshaus Luck: Surviving the Unspeakable in Auschwitz and Dora."
4,Simple but SO MUCH FUN! :D,"For Mario Party this game is very simple. Simple boards, simple orbs, simple bowser times, simple minigames, simple everything! This game just was simple and easy. But for some reason this game did well and for that reason is it had the old mario charm. You feel like your there with your person you are. The boards are colorful each with their own lotorey. This game is simple BUT SO MUCH FUN!:D"
5,Let's Party!,Mario Party 4 is the 4th installment of the popular series. You play on a board like a real boardgame and you got to roll the dice. You win the game when you collect enough stars. Collecting Stars will cost you 20 coins (or no coins at all if you find a star in a hidden box).I have been a fan of the Mario Party series ever since I played Mario Party 2. Four people can play in this fun game!
2,Gets very old very quick,"I highly advise you not to buy this. (...) I suppose this is a good party game, but I think MK: DD!! is a much better one. Anyway, the game is very slow-pased and boring, and there isn't much variety at all. After a while, you just won't care what you'll unlock, as there are so many better games out."
4,Fun for the college types,"I can't say how good this game is in comparison with other Mario multiplayer games, but this one is great. If you are unfamilar with the format: Players roll dice and move around a board in search of stars, like a board game without a fixed finish line. (The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds.) After each round (in which each player moves once), there is a mini-game that involves every player. These are great for keeping things interesting: just rolling dice might get boring without the mini-games, and if you win a lot of them, you have a better chance of winning the big game. There are several ways, in fact, to earn stars, and it is sometimes surprising to find out who wins. Skill and chance are balanced, so that no one can coast to victory, but your little cousin can still give you a run for your money. Don't let the kiddie stuff fool you: this is a great game to play into the early morning hours (when you should be studying for your electromagnetics exam)."
4,party over here!,"Reviewer:AdrielGraphics:3/5 there nice but a bit outdated for todaySound:3.5/5 I wish they had the classic mario music,but you have annoying taunts to annoy your friends!Gameplay:4/5,a bit thin in story,but so much fun in multiplayer.Replay:5/5,never gets old.buy it if u need multiplayer fun,or since the story is about getting birthday presents,buy it on your friends birthdaymario strikes back with the 85%"
1,Mario Party 4 is a waste of $,"I bought my 5 year old this because it was a multi player game.This game is like a board game, the players rolls the dice and move in turn. It is extremely boring and slow moving. If you want to play a game like this any $ board game would be more fun. I was not able to sit thru it for more than 10 min. The mini games are a bit less boring than the actual game, but they are not enough fun make it worth torturing yourself by playing this game. I dont understand how anyone gave it more than one star.DONT waste Your $ on this game. Your money can be much better spent on - probably anything!"
1,Just another money making scheme,"I'm sick of mario party titles. The first one was fun, the second one was weak, but still good, and from there on the series hit rock bottom and dragged it's way across it. It may entertain someone who's never played the series, but everyone else will be dead sick of it. Mario party should have stayed Mario Party, and there shouldn't have been any sequels. Obviously Nintendo's in this franchise for the money and only the money."
3,"Nice, but 1-player mode is a hassle.","Well, for starters, the game is quite entertaining. You are one of the characters assosiated with Mario and play on a larger-than-life board. However, you get,lets see, 8 different character picks! If youre playing alone, the game board goes through a tranformation from a nice take-your-turn game into a HURRY UP YOSHI BEFORE I BREAK MY GAMECUBE!!! game. Another thing is that you really get to choose from only six characters because who wants to be Wario or Waluigi: not to mention that Waluigi walks like he's constipated. The minigames are fun, like Stamp out and the one where you take turns pushing the levers, trying not to blow up Bowser. It's great for young kids, because of the bright colors, but unless you have an endless bounty of never-quiting freinds, your in for a long day. And one other thing: Nintendo needs to get it through their thick skulls; The rapid tap mini games could give someone corporal tunnel. Goodbye."
3,IT DIDN'T WORK,I got the game but it wouldn't read. I tried everything and it still wouldn't work. However i was able to return it and get refunded.
3,"Mario Party 4, you get what you pay for.","I'm going to make this review short. Mario Party 4 is fun, if you've played any of the others, you know what to expect and you get it. The game isn't a break through, but if you want a fun party game for all ages this it. This game can entertain kids under 10 for hours, or provide a great game to drink to for college kids. While this may be best to rent when you want to play, it does have a story mode, and a chance to unlock prizes for each character, which can take a long amount of time. In closing if you want a non challenge but fun game, get it."
3,Entertaining for a night,"Mario Pary 4 was a great game, but if you just play one player, the game goes on forever. Also the game gets extremely repetative. I beat the game on 1-player mode in one night and unless there are more people to play with you, don't own this game. Rent it, return it, and you never have to play it again."
2,Wow what were they thinking,Yes the mini games were new and somewhat fun but they hurt your hands. however the maps weren't creative at all. They were all square shaped. I was really upset about this game. and also the lack of fun. It should have been good but the maps were horrible. I've played it once and thought wow this game is bad. Then I went back to my old N64 and played Mario party 3. Maybe the next one will be better but until then I would not buy this game.
3,"Good, but old...","I have played mario party a lot as I own mario party 1,2 and 3. The fourth one is good, it has good graphics, it runs smoothly but there just is'nt enough new here. It is very similiar to the other mario party."
5,"Party Fun, but easily done","Mario Party 4 is a great party game, but easily gets boring in story mode (I rate the 4 player mode 5/5 stars, but the story mode, 3/5 stars) and story mode is easily beaten so it's 'Party Fun, but easily done' (but it's also very corny, I mean The Party Cube'? CORNY!).Link"
3,Pretty good,"This is nothing spectacular, they could have used so much more sound files for character voices and the amount of mini-games doesn't really impress, but it's good for a rental when your friends come by on the weekend. Best party game on next-gen systems so far (but that's no contest).I hope to see a sequel each year, improving every element."
5,The Party's in full effect #4!,#4!?!?!? How great is this game? IT'S ALMOST PERFECT! I love it sooooooooooooo much it can't stop to talk about it unless I feel like not playing it! There's 1 must-own PARTY GAME AND THIS IS IT!
4,Quite fun!,"There are some really fun minigames in this game like ""Booksquirm"", but there is also a load of boring 3-1 games, I didn't really like ANY of them.The graphics are very pretty, the water effects in one of the minigames is beautiful.There's also a lottery where you can win muschrooms or money.Bowser Minigames are fun, a bit long, but I love the humor in ""Fruits of Doom"".""Dee-lish!""My only complaint about this game is how SLOW the characters move on the board, it's like watching them walk in slow-motion, it sadly takes up most of the time you are playing."
4,slightly dissapointed but hey who cares!,"I'm Espio and I love all of the mario party games from 1-6 but Mario Party 4 is one I was dissapointed in. First lets go through some downsides. Its quite slow compared to some of the other games,some of the items are...well...chee-seey and some of the boards are not so great.Hey now for good stuff.Shy-Guys board rocks!plain and simple,the mini games are great and the graphics well their boss! So if your a big fan of the series like me then get it it's cool but if your looking for your first Party then I recomend Mario Party 1 or 2."
3,Nintendo Fiesta!,"I'll be completely honest with you. Mario Party 4 was the very first of the Mario Party series I got my hands on. In fact, the decision to purchase Mario Party 4 was not on my behalf, it was my significant other's. Was I impressed? Was I disappointed? Read below and decipher for yourself!Mario Party 4 is an impressive game * IF * you have others to participate 100% of the time. The Story Mode (single player) is close to garbage. So with that said, if you have no one around to join the ""party"", you're going to find yourself unhappy with this one.The colorful graphics are great. Solid sounds accompanied by smooth gameplay. The multiplayer mode is great if you have skilled opponents around. The game's biggest downside is the lack of challenge on single player, and also the character selection. Who really wants to play as Wario or Waluigi?Bottom line, great game if you have playmates, somewhat questionable if you're an independent gamer."
5,Great.,"Sent in quickly, no damage. I would've liked it to come with the original case instead of just a CD cover, but ok. Thank you!"
4,"In a word, Garbage.","[$] is how much this ridiculous game cost me, only for me to chuck it into a drawer in hopes of forgetting the mistake made when I purchased it.The graphics were okay, but the game boards bit the big one. I didn't understand the purpose of the Mega Mushroom unless it was to cause players to loose 10 coins, that might I add, you don't get to keep. There were way to many usless items that could be bought and that pickle-smoocher Daisy seemed to always win the game (talk about your cheese-whiz). ..."
2,Mario Party 4,"I rented this game last night and just didn't enjoy it a lot. If you are a big fan of the other Mario Party games, you will love this game because there are a few extra things and of course slightly better graphics. There are many new mini games that are very fun (one of my favorites was where you and a partner are climbing up the side of a cliff but have to be careful not to get blown off by a snowstorm.) However, the reason I have problems with Mario Party games in general is of how long it seems to take each player to take their turn (""rolling"" the dice, moving, and the results from that). I dont care about seeing what happens to the computer players. However, I guess the makers were trying to make it as much of a real board game as possible (waiting patiently for your turn). The only truly fun part for me is the Mini Games. If you LOVE Mario Party, go ahead and buy it, but if you have doubts, rent first."
5,BEST MARIO PARTY OUT OF 1-4!!!,"I don't care what other people say, in my opinion this game is great.The gameplay is 10/10, and so are all the other categories! An example of one of the mini-games is Domination. It is a very heart thumping mini-game! If you are a board game fan, BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!"
2,the worst party ever,"this game was horrid compaired to the first. when i upgraded from a n64 to a gamecube, i got this game. the only thing different was that they copyed every game except they made it worse and added some of the worst games ever. the graphics are an upgrade and they made items that help you around the board, but it goes to waste on really bad levels. they added 2 odd characters daisey and waligi, a copy off of peach and a cross between wario and luigi with conan o'brians legs and a purple suit. ehg"
2,WHY DID I BUY,"I brought this game 2 days ago and seriously its reallllly boring. I will never lie. Please dont waste your money.First time was really amazed at the grapics and the demos they had in store, but when you really play it the mini games are not mini but ultra very mini mini and dont last long like 30 sec. Admit graphics are cute and good.-mini games are very boring-wait to long for the games-GET SUPER MONKEY BALL INSTEAD (AWESOME)-I HAVE REGRET, ...in AUS"
1,Waste of $money$,"This game was addictive to me for a while, but it got real old FAST. The storyline is stupid, I mean really, who wants to work their back off trying to get presents for YOUR birthday?! Also, the game way too easy, and the game is a repeat of Mario Party 3. No new character and character voices, it's once again just a bunch of annoying squeaking animals. In addition, there are only 6 boards in total, and they are so plain. This game seriously needs to take advantage of the Gamecube features. Apparently, Hudson and Nintendo are still living in the Nintendo 64 era. The only thing OK about the game is the graphics. Beside that, it's a waste of money. Don't get it, I warn you, you'll want your money back very soon after purchase! You can also see my review on Mario Party 5 if you visit that page."
2,Again?????,"Ok Mario Party is fun.....! But i think that a 4 is not good. Mario Party one was very good, two was ok and 3 was sooo boring and just the same again. I know everybody is going to say oh, but this one is diferent is for NGC, but is always the same. So if you already have one mario party that will do, but if you dont hava anyone but the 4 for the NGC......"
4,BEACH VOLLEYBALL!,"I find this game to be pretty boring (3 stars). I hate waiting through other character's turns. dull.BUT...After beating the parties, you're reward an awesome extra game in the extra-game room. It's beach volleyball and it isa blast! (5 stars- thus, an average of 4-(even though I hate having to rechoose all the info after losing- it needs a replay option) Anyway, the beach volleyball is the best part of this game."
3,Nothing to Throw a Party over!,"MArio PArty 4 is some decent fun for about an hour or so,then becomes annoying.I think it is really made for small children.Some kids around the ages of 6 to 9 will think it's great fun.Basically the game involoves a giant board game that involves some quite fun mini games here and there.It is worth a try but I do NOT recommend that anyone BUY it!"
2,[boring!!!],"I am a huge fan of mario party games. except for this one. This game is boring. I will tell you a few reasons. The loading time on the game is terrible. By loading time i mean like the corny animations they add in to make it more ""cool"". And in the mini game room to get from one game to another takes forever. In 3, you can just hit the A button to play again. In 4 they removed that feature.In mario party 3 the maps you play on are way better. The new maps are soooo dumb.They removed a few features too like the good layout of the mini game room (previously mensioned) and they took out duel mode.Aside from the graphics and the mini games the game made no improvements. The only thing I can honestly say i like in the new game are some of the more complicated mini games. Overall, mario party 3 is better. don't say that because it is older it can't be better cause trust me, it is."
3,"Fun, but not Great.","Mario Party 4 continues the traditional Mario Party games. You get together with 4 other classic Mario characters, you get on a huge board, and you play a game, filled with Mini-Games. Who the hell is Waluigi anyway? It's kinda like Mariopoly, or a game of Monopoly, except with Mario. Now, the N64 titles were absurdly fun, and this one is too, but it's probably the worst in the series although it's not a bad game! Half of the mini-games are incredulously fun, while the other half are a waste of gaming time. The boards are a little bit more boring than previously, and the mini-games aren't as good as the earlier ones. The scheme this time is boring-you have to get back Mario's presents for his birthday. Overall, it's a tough decision. If you really love Mario or the Mario Party series, then buy this game now! If not, stay far, far away!"
3,Its kinda boring,Its kinda fun for 15 minutes but after that it gets boring but after a few hours its fun again so its OK.
1,A Huge Dissapointment...,"When I saw the commercial for this Mario Party 4 I almost jumped out of my seat. 50 mini-games?! I took my hard earned $..., and purchased the game. Five minutes into the game, I realized that I had made a mistake. Mario Party 4 is boring at best. Gameplay is constantly interrupted by text-boxes full of meaningless information. 75% of the time is spent watching the animated characters move around. To top it off, the mini-games that I was looking forward to turned out to be quick little dissapointments. If you are looking for a great game with hours of potential game play, get yourself a copy of Super Monkey Ball. That should hold you over until a new version of Mario Kart comes out."
1,NOT FOR ANYONE OVER 4 !!,"This game is such a waste of money!! You had to be a brain-washed Mario ""fan"" to Love this game!!! Only my 4 yr. old LIKES this game!!! You CAN""T Leave the game when you Want to...You CAN""T save the games YOU want to save... You just , hop around a Monoply type game board, without much brain work or control of YOUR character.... WHAT IS THE POINT to Mario 4?"
1,Can this game get much worse??,"Wow...... WOw..... WOW!!!!! CAN THIS GAME GET N E WORSE!??!? i mean come on, this is a classic example of too much of a good thing. 1 was great, 2 was amazing, 3 was wonderful, 4 JUST [was bad]!!!!! they should have stopped at three, they took a good thing and took it too far, enough said. they ruined this series and is they come out with a 5, god help us all, it will be the end of the mariobrothers as we know it!!!"
1,Where is the real Mario,"My kids received Gamecube for Christmas and Mario sunshine and Mario party 4. Since then, I have returned the Gamecube and both games. My 5 year old and 8 year could not play them. My sons thought the games were confusinig and not any fun."
5,Great Party Game!,"This was a great recovery from the terrible Mario Party 3! I""m so glad they took out that stupid Die thing and that evil star. They brought the charcters back to normal and now playing lots of crazy mini games. I like this game because of the characters reactions and boards. This game is fun with other people so join up with friends and play!"
