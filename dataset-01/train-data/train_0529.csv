4,Playing with your Right Brain,"Wonderful book for novices picking up a pencil and drawing paper the first time ever. The book is very easy to understand and the instructions are very clear. I was totally blown away by what I could draw after the first few chapters. This text is especially helpful for any analysts, scientists, or engineers who want to engage thier more creative right brain. The book helps you break free from your left brain and enjoy the playful creative right hemisphere. I am 1/2 way through the book and totally enjoying it. I intend to follow up with an art class."
5,Excellent book!,"I had to give my input here when I saw people giving this book less than good reviews. I have been an artist my whole life (26 years so far), and I gained so much from this book. I used it for a drawing course I took in college. I wish someone had given me this book years ago. Learning to switch from left to right brain mode makes such a difference! The only reason I can think that people might not like this book is that they didn't learn how to switch over to right brain mode. My drawing improved greatly from studying this book!"
4,"worthwhile but the ""science"" is silly","As an adult taking a beginners' drawing class, I enjoyed Betty Edwards' book and found it to be an interesting and useful supplement to other materials. I always enjoy reading about my hobbies, when I can find thoughtful points of view that go beyond how-to guides. I enjoyed the book, in that way. Also, Dr. Edwards offers practical exercises -- not that they are necessarily unique to this book -- that I found helpful. On the other hand, some of the underlying philosophy is... well, a little goofy. For example, one of the experts she cites repeatedly, professor Charles Tart, is best known as a proponent of the ""sciences"" of the paranormal (ESP, psychic communication, near-death experiences, and so on). But if you don't mind that sort of nonsense, you probably will feel that the book is worth the price. I did."
2,Try a Different Book!,"When the first book came out many years ago I was extremely excited, and actually wrote my senior thesis for my Art Education degree about the right/left brain theory. I used the material from the first book to instruct the kids in my classes when I began to teach. Then I paid a lot of money to go see Betty Edwards give a lecture. I was disappointed, turned off, and my whole image of Ms. Edwards was crushed. Now the new book...my true opinion is that she is trying to reinvent the material to make a few more bucks. This book has some viable exercises, and would be fine for the non-drawing person who needs some direction. However, there are a lot of other books (like The Natural Way to Draw) that are a whole lot better. Betty Edwards is not God's gift to learning how to draw...practice and determination are. My advice? Get a different book."
1,the new drawing on the right side of the brain,totally completely disappointed...over 300 pages of psychology...very little instruction in technique...very few samples that were large enough to actually see...if i hadn't gotten a great price and if i wouldn't have to pay postage...again...i'd return it...disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Classic,and thats what it is a classic in its own right almost everyone of my art teachers knows of this book and has read it one time or another its so good ! seriously and the before and after examples are really astounding !
3,NOT QUALIFIED,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK AS I WAS TAKING A CLASS. THIS WAS NOT RIGHT FOR ME AS I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DRAW PERIOD...NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF MY BRAIN.READ THIS IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DRAW.....I WAS NOT QUALIFIED.
3,Betty Edwards:The new drawing on the right side of the brain,"This book is definitely onto something but it was too vague for me! I felt I was almost onto something but not quite. It all sounds good and reasonable but it is never concrete enough and much of it is about this meditation-type-thing. I may have got better by it but i haven't got good, and tapping into those so called resources that are already there never seem to happen for me. So in short; this book is onto something good but it's too vague. But it could have been that the norwegian translation was bad though, but i dont think so. But still, this may be the only one of its kind."
4,Good service,"Hello customers, i just want to let you know that the book i purchased was very good. Despite that there were some highlighted pages, which i really didn't mind, the book was in great conditions. I really like the service, so i really recommend others to buy their books or other products from my friendly vendor."
3,pretentious,"there's some good stuff in there, but just about every chapter starts out""I used to think that everyone just naturally knew how to do [specific art technique] like I did, and was astounded when I had a class full of students failing to do it! And I said to them 'students! why are you doing this so wrong?!' and the students said 'I'm doing the best I can, you arrogant fool!' and then I learned how to actually teach."""
2,Only for people who REALLY can't draw,"I'm sure this book might help some. I was under a different impression when I bought this book, I expected more, some excersizes for more advanced artists and not just for beginners, but this book is strictly for those who simply can not draw. This book just wasn't for me and so I found it unhelpful."
3,It's alright,"I was required to buy this for my art class. It's a pretty good read, but not overly unique in its views"
3,"Wordy, overly complicated methods of drawing","Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah! This book could be so much more with a lot less words. Good reading if you want to go to sleep easily. It does contain useful techniques to help you see. The assignments make you go through the process of seeing to become better at drawing. It's a good compilation of techniques found in other books, just so very wordy..."
5,Validation for drawing reality,"Thank you Ms. Edwards! I stopped drawing for years because my sketches in school were consistently considered stiff and too representational. This book got me started sketching again without having to be self-conscious about the artistry of the picture. Her validation of drawing exactly what you see as a worthwhile skill, and quite probably a necessary step on the road to a freer expression was a revelation."
4,Wow!,"This was an ""eye opener"" and have lots of interesting and good thoughts! I'll recomed this book to private persons who want's to learn more and to art teachers to take the class to the next level!"
4,A very handy reference,"Betty Edwards has given me a book I can use not only for my art work, but for everyday decision making."
5,Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,This was shipped quickly and received in the condition promised. It was a great value for the money paid and exactly what her art teacher wanted her to use. She has been putting it to good use every day.
5,Best book for drawing.,"If you have always wanted to draw - this is the book to have. The exercises are well written. Once you complete the exercises, you will view things in a different and better way. When I went through these I saw a lot more beauty in simples subjects than I had before. This is just an exceptional book. You can learn to draw from this one book."
2,FISH OR CUT BAIT.,"I agree with the author on most points, but she wastes too much time indoctrinating converts with her nifty science of brain processing.I'm impatient with authors who inflate and bloat their books to reach a specific page count publishers prefer. The essential information gets buried in the unnecessary noise. Make it lean and mean and use the extra pages for a coloring book of the book's salient points."
3,Worked great--then nothing,"Worked great the first couple days then stopped working. For me, needs to be cycled. I took on an empty stomach first thing in the morning."
2,Did nothing for me.,This is supposed to boost your mental clarity.Especially when detoxing from coffee.It did nothing for me. And I bought three bottles!I should have bought a book or CD instead.
1,Bones,"I bought this book expecting to share some fascinating stories and experiences, instead each chapter began a buildup and then suddenly you were left standing there alone wondering what happened where did the story go. Very aggravating, then oh yes, this is by the way, where we were, toodle oo on the next tale, or a portion of it anyway."
1,I'd rather watch cable!!,"I have worked in the 'Osteoarchaeology' field for nearly 10 years and I when I bought this book I did not expect to be reading a novel type book. Books like this are dramatised on frequently watched cable/network tv - I live in Ireland! I have used other books by the author and found them invaluable, but not this.....an ok read but dreadful reference material."
2,not as good as I hoped.,"This book starts out interesting enough with a murder case, but the conclusion of that case was never established and the following chapters deal with other cases that are equally incompletely resolved. The chapters that deal with how to distinguish human bones from animal, how to differentiate between the races and sexes are better but the detail he goes into is very slight. This book didn't live up to billing. In comparison, the novel ""Deja Dead"" (by: Patricia Cromwell) was much better in providing a window into forensic anthropology due to the beautiful details that she used."
3,"Interesting Topic, But Writing was a bit Rough","Forensic Science is a fascinating thing. Who'd have thought that bones could tell so many tales? My biggest problem with this book was the way it was written. It jumps around from old to recent cases and back again a half dozen times in the same chapter. I understand that they were trying to keep the same sort of cases together, but in a book like this, solid dates and a chronological flow would have been much nicer.I can see how some people would get bored by it; there were a ton of cases covered but none very thoroughly. I thought it was a decent read, but probably not one I'd ever read again."
2,Just a memoir,"Although the authors are clearly very well versed in forensic anthropology, I was disappointed in the way they presented their material. The chapters weren't difficult to follow, but they read like memoirs of the authors' cases and I got the sense the authors were more interested in showing off than sharing knowledge with nonscientists. That made it tricky to isolate details, and frankly I've learned more from general crime scene books that devoted just one chapter to forensic anthropology. Bottom line: If you're looking for a solid reference book that you can turn to again and again, you'll probably find satisfaction only in the glossary at the end."
5,Track Listing,CASSETTE: Includes extended remixes of each of the following songs:1. Atomic Dog2. Computer Games3. Man's Best Friend4. Loopzilla
1,Be cautious,"I have always had excellent service with amazon, but with this product it continues to read region error. It will not play on my DVD player."
5,"good condition, quick delivery",I really love this movie so i was pleased to find it at such a great price. The condition of the movie is perfect. I also couldn't ask for better fast and efficient service!!!
5,happy with product.,the movie was shiped very quick and everything came very well packaged. The sight was very easy to use. Thanks!
5,We love the Flicka series!,My daughter is in 2nd grade and we love the Flicka series of movies. This is one of her favorites.
4,Before Springtime for Hitler there was Charlie,"I guarantee that you will never come across a stranger piece of World War Two ephemera than this. Jazz was frowned upon by the Nazis, but sometime in 1941 a group of musicians hit on an ingenious scheme to keep playing this ""degenerate"" music. They rerecorded swing classics of the era, substituting with ""humorous"" propaganda lyrics. The results are jaw-dropping: much of the intended humour is about as subtle as a flying bomb, and the rampant anti-Semitism mught be too much for some people (although my sax teacher, who is not only Jewish but lived through the war, thinks it's the funniest thing he's ever heard).One to slip on unannounced during a dinner party methinks.""Who likes bombing?""""We like bombing!"""
3,Historical,"These albums get a bit boring if listened to for too long, but they are a super example of the Nazi propoganda of the day. Ignore the lyrics and just enjoy the music.."
3,Its noble goal: trying to apply PL theory to a SE tool.,"The first chapter is quite well-written. It presents a friendly introduction to types and typed lambda calculi and intuitively sketches the motive and results of the remaining chapters.As for those, one might do well to read the first few pages of each chapter before sinking into the details. Motivation and definitions are generally presented up front, before descending into all the requisite formalisms and proofs (which are best left to professional programming language theorists).The general thesis is that types provide a specification of software components, and isomorphisms are useful in constructing a tool to search through libraries of components. Di Cosmo does not, however, try very hard to convince the reader that types are ENOUGH of a specification of a function's behavior to be effective for retrieving useful modules from large, real-world software libraries."
3,poor merchandize,"When the case was received it was broken! It was not wrapped in the normal way. When trying to play the music some of the songs were in heavy static. I tried using another C.D. and it was fine. That means my player is fine, The songs are not sounding proper. I feel that I was given a used copy of the music. That was or is not right! I'm sorry I could not complain earlier. Something should be done to give me a finer copy of the music as I once really enjoyed. I had previously enjoyed the music but an auto accident caused me to lose the C.D."
2,Not the best toy for your buck!,"I bought this cd player for my daughter for Christmas this year and buy Mon. evening the tab to keep the lid closed had already broken. The player still works but you would think that it would be a little more durable seeing as it is designed for a child.......The songs are pretty crappy, to fast and no words just the music, however, my daughter seems to love it."
2,Annoying,"My 3 yr old got this for a present. The button to open the top didn't work from the get go. I have to open it up by pulling up on the lid. My daughter cannot do it herself. I would like this toy, even though it is really flimsy, except for the fact that the music is without words and ridiculously fast and over stimulating. My daughter ....and son think it's fun but they get too amped up when this toy is being used. It might accidentally disappear."
1,Volume Control,"My three year old girl loves this, but we hate it. It has no volume control and it is loud."
1,Absolute Junk!,"My 3 year old was so excited to get a CD palyer of her own - however this is abosolute junk and a HUGE disappointmnet. She used it once - the top broke off, the CD's don't play the music from the movies, they play poorly recorded imatations with no singing - only unpleasant music that you can't even dance to. Don't waste your $ money on this one."
2,Just A Toy,"I purchasd the item believing that it would actually play ""real"" cd's. However, upon discovering that it did not, I accepted my fate. However, when attempting the play the provided cd's, they simply did not work in the manner I believed they should(e.g.,I believed that by placing each cd in the player,I would be able to play selected songs.This did not happen). As well, the door was too easily removed. This was purchased for my 4yo granddaughter. She was bored with it in an hour."
2,Not as good as other princess CD players,"This toy looks cute, but the lid pops off so easily that it is really unusable for little kids. I have another princess CD player for my 4 year old that came with a book and it works much better. I bought this one for my 2 year old so she would have one of her own, but as soon as you open the lid to change the CD it pops off and only an adult can pop it back on. My 2 year old can play the music, but the sound is very poor. I would not recommend this one as there are other princess CD players on the market that are better."
5,Thank You Sooooo Much,"My three Year old daugther loves her CD player, it makes her think that she is in another world, she is definity my Disney Princess!!!!!!"
3,Cute but NOT durable,My daughter got this toy for her 4th birthday. In 2 weeks the tab to keep the lid shut broke off. The machine still plays without the lid but then the pictures of the Princesses are gone and not as nice. The songs are just computerized music but my daughter still loved to change the CD's herself. This product was cute in theory but not very durable at all.
2,Took It Back,"We bought this for my daughters fourth birthday but took it back when we realized that none of the princesses sing on the cd's. It's cute, but boring. We found the disney princesses sing along microphone instead that she can sing with the princesses or on her own and dance to the beat of just the music. I'm glad we made that switch!"
2,Disappointing,I ordered the Disney Princess CD Player for my 3 year old daughter last Christmas. The lid comes off very easily and she's not strong enough to pop the CD's in and out. It is difficult even for me! The song clips are too short and not the original familiar versions. It will be in the Good Will bag before the next Christmas comes along.
3,small,"I bought this cutter for my husband, but it has a rather small opening. This would probably be suitable for thin cigars. It is also slightly flimsy. If you don't plan on using it a lot, I'm sure its okay."
1,Disappointment and deception,"This is one of my favorite albums of all time and, since I no longer have a turntable, I ordered the CD. I was very disappointed to discover that the songs on the CD were not at all like the record. I returned the CD and still had to pay the shipping. I do feel that this was false advertising on behalf of the CD company who used the same title as the record, but did not include the same songs."
3,Great Songs,"I have the original album and loved it years ago. I looked to see if I could find a CD on Amazon, and was successful, of course. The CD is definitely not as good as the album, but I still like the music and their two voices together. This brings back old memories too. I would recommend this CD for anyone who has been a fan of these two people and their music. It is fun!"
5,Don't make the mistake that I did...,"Don't make the mistake that I did and buy one of his cds, because you will eventually need the next... and then the next. It is much cheaper to just get right to the cold hard truth: You will love this music; all of it. I wish I trusted the reviews and just bought the darn box set, but no... I had to get each album one... at...a... time... What a waste of time and money!Nobody does it like Nick Drake. Every single song is five stars, in my book. Buy it."
5,A 'must' for any fan of great songwriting,"All it takes for me to buy a mew CD is for someone to say ""it reminds me a little of Nick Drake"". Deep down, however, I know there will never be another."
5,I Can't Stop Listening,I just got this collection from Amazon and it is incredible. I highly recommend it for any person in love with great music good wine and fireplaces. Sit back and listen to this wonderful music. What an amazing talent Nick Drake was. Don't fret over this purchase you will love it.
5,This counts as one,"You know that game you play when you ask someone ""If you were sent to a deserted island and you could only bring four records (er..CDs) with you what would those four be?"" I would have to ask could Nick Drake's box set, Fruit Tree, count as one record (er...CD)? If the answer was ""no"" then I would have to say ""I would bring Nick Drake's Fruit Tree."" And I would live out the rest of my days on that island very happily."
5,Never felt magic as crazy as this,"Usually a boxed set seems like a lot of any artist, even one you love. But there has never been, and likely will never be, anyone quite like Nick Drake. Even the outtakes disc is remarkable, but his three studio records are some of the finest ever recorded. I can honestly say that you might as well buy the boxed set, because once you listen to any single record, you'll want them all."
3,Not a glowing review,If I would have had the opportunity to view this book in a bookstore I would not have purchased it. The first three chapters all discuss why you would want to perform RCA and who should do it. Chapter 4 provides a very basic overview of tools you can use for RCA. Chapter 5 is all about a basic checklist and chapter 6 is fluff with two generic examples.Unless you know nothing about quality management systems my advice is to save your money and spend a few minutes searching the web. You will find better information for free.
1,Root Cause Analysis: Basic Tools and Techniques,"This book has a list of basic documentation tools for organization of information. However, the thinking process for RCFA is not discussed. You can find basic information for documentation tools to organize information (fishbone, pareto, etc) on the internet. The REAL root cause tools that uses a CASUE and EFFECT relationship to describe a logical chain are not described much at all, my favorite tools were not included. The book is good to find basic documentation tools to organize information, but it is not a root cause help for any problems that has the slightest complexity in my opinion."
4,RoyalRumble Review,"1. Edge vs Shawn MichaelsThis was a great opener, with two talented wrestlers. This match ENDED with Edge using the ropes for the win. (8/10)2.Casket MatchUndertaker vs Heidenreich. (6/10)3.WWE Championship (Triple Threat, No DQ)JBL (c) vs Kurt Angle vs Big Show. JBL survived again. (8.5/10)4.World Heavyweight ChampionshipTriple H (c) vs Randy Orton(8/10)5.Royal Rumble MatchThis was a great match. Batista won. (10/10)"
5,ff,"Yo smackdown is getting worse day by day and i dont know what the hell is going on on raw. eric is gone because he is the best general manager everi dont know how you stupid f*cking people think about Teddy Long, he is not f*cking creative. The strategy on smackdown is always somebody coming out first, arguing and then Long comes out and make a tag matchStupid f*cking Teddy Long sucksbring eric back you F*cking stupid mcmanhonand hopefully wwe will change the name to wwf"
1,This Rumble is stupid!,In my opinion wwe keeps getting dumber and dumber with these ppvs.Most of all of them are boring except for the major one's like WrestleMania and Summerslam.First of all when I seen Hbk vs Edge I knew this ppv was going downhill.The match was boring and Edge ended up cheating for the win.The second match was ok but was to short for a casket match.The third match was the triple threat between Kurt Angle Jbl and the Big Show.This match was'nt even worth mentioning.The fourth match between Triple H and Randy Orton was good but I still didnt get a kick out of it.And the rumble was the worst rumble in history with Batista who ended up winning.I wanted Hbk to win the rumble but that sore loser Kurt who had alredy been eliminated by Hbk came back in and attacked Michaels preventing him from winning.Overall dumb ppv not worth the money!
4,Royal Rumble 2005,1.Shawn Michaels vs EdgeAwesome opener.8/102.Casket MatchUndertaker vs Heindenriechi expected more out of this match but it was pretty cool when kane popped out of the casket and the leg drop on hendenriechs head which was under the casket.8/103.Triple Threat WWE Championship MatchJBL(c) vs Big Show vs Kurt Anglepretty good match big show goes through announce table jbl retains by clostineing the hell out of angle.9/104.World Heavyweight ChampionshipTrple H(c) vs Randy Ortonmatch of da night awesome randy orton gets a concussion he was a little lost triple h retains after pedigree.10/105.Royal Rumble MatchAwesome rumble but not the best batista wins it with a little controversy.9/10
3,Rumble 05,"Edge vs HBK - Even thogh I hate Edge I liked this match.Undertaker vs. Heidenreich - Casket match - This was good. I think Taker should have lost this one, to help put Heidenreich over. The only time I can think of that Taker lost to put sombody over was when he lost to Brock in hell in a cell.Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. JBL - I cant stand triple threat matches. They all have the same set-up. One guy gets knocked out and the other two guys fight, and it alternates who knocked out.Triple H vs. Randy Orton - awesome, even thogh I knew Randy wouldnt win.Rumble match - not as good as 2001 and 2003 but still good"
5,WWE Royal Rumble 05 predictions,"I havent seen this yet but this would kick a** if this is what happens...1st match:RVD and Rey M. vs Doug and Danny B.2nd match:Lita vs Trish for womens chapionship3rd match:Kane vs Gene S. 3 stages of he**1st fall Last man Standing2nd match First Blood3rd fall Cage match4th ,atch:WWE Champion JBL vs the return of Brock Lesnar or Big Show5th match:Batista vs HHH for the world title batista champ6th matchRoyal Rumble matchwinner and #1 contender for wwe title John Cena(Cena may have a match with Jesus or Carlito)if that happens then Randy Orton or someone cool will win.ps randy rocks!!!!"
5,I love Batista,I think this is truely one of the best Royal Rumble matches that I have seen. I enjoyed seeing Batista become his own person instead of just being a part of Evolution. And the WWE is always generous with extras. Definitely add this one to your WWE collection.
1,ipod docking station,"I don't recomend this product it stops playing every minute or so, then it comes in louder when started again. Very disappointed, will have to return it, and had to go without music all week during our get away."
4,ipod speakers,"very good. not as good as a stereo, but good enough for a portable speaker for a living room or bedroom."
3,OK SPEAKERS,I had a very good deal on this item so I can't complain! For the price paid they are okay speakers.Altec Lansing is a good brand. I bought speakers for my MAC and they are very good.I was cheap on this item! I admit! (BOOOOOO!!!!!) I would have bought Bose Doc for my iPod but didn't want to spend $299.00Once again for the deal I got I can't complain. They are OKAY but don't pay full price for them.
1,these don't last...,"I have had two sets of these speakers now and the third just quit working. They last about 3 months. It's not like I take them anywhere, they pretty much stay in my office. Other than that, the sound is good. I have also purchased a cheapie $5 speaker on Amazon, and those work great and I haul them around everywhere."
2,Dissapointed with Altech,"I am very disappointed with the audio quality of this speakers, just for the record I am not an audiophile, but the sound quality is really disappointing compared to other speakers with similar prices. I buyed this speakers because I have been loyal to Altec from a long time, that was of course until I got this product."
4,Lansing inMotion iM5 is great,"This product was given to a friend as a gift. I was so impressed by the quality of sound, the size, and the fact that it charges while you listen, that I ordered it right away. I am quite satisfied with this audio system."
2,"ergonomic, impressive","I loved this little, unit unit. I'd like it to be louder, .. but WHen I bought it it seemed to be Well built, intelligent design. and I liked it so much, when it developed a problem ( Which I thought was my fault..) I went out and bought another one. .The problem was.. I was using it outdoors at art shows. I heard a serious static .. wondered if I damaged it soehow..got it wet? No, I don't think so..but what could have happened ? THis problem, coupled with the fact that it didn't play very loud, seriously interfered with my plan. I got no where in inquiries. I bought another. It developed the same exact problem ! and the unit costs much more..I do not recommend this unit any longer."
4,"Fast Service, Good Product","The player works very well and is easy to use. Only ding, there is a little distortion when you really crank it up. Product came quickly and was packaged well. I would definitely order from this company again."
5,Terrific iPod Audio System,"Assembly is simple. The sound of this system is terrific, but easily adjusted up or down. Sound is very clear. My only suggestion for improvement would be a remote. Good value of top rated system for excellent price."
1,Burned twice!,"I really loved these speakers with their cute little bag that had a space for the ipod itself (yes, lame reason, but there it is). They also had such good sound for small speakers, that when they started malfunctioning by making popping cut out sounds with heavy bass, I returned them for a refund and ordered them again from a different seller. Unfortunately, I had the same popping noises happen again within a week, so I had to return them once again. Now I give up despite the cute bag. The manufacturer really needs to work on this major defect if it effected one buyer twice!"
2,Altec Lansing Speaker System,"The altec speakers put out quality sound but I was disappointed when I discovered a glitch with the speakers. When I first used the speakers, the sound was on 10. I turned the sound down to a reasonable level. The next time I turned the system on, the sound was on 10 again. I was expecting the sound to be at the level it was when I shut it down. I was not impressed with these speakers because of that."
1,Do NOT purchase this or any other rodut from Factory Depot,I have no idea if the product is any good but after waiting weeks for a delivery I found out they can't ship. Don't send email as to why and don't answer the phone. What's even worse is that Amazon will not step in and offer a product solution.They offer my $$ back but too late to get it delivered and wrapped and off to my son.Bummer.Not going to be using Amazon again
4,Not bad...,"This is not a bad little portable unit. Not bad sound at all, and very portable. The $50. price was good. My only problem with this unit is the tray that holds the ipod sometimes sticks when you try to pop it out. Other then that, this is a good buy for the price."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"This speaker system not only works great, but is very convenient and inexpensive.I got one for each room!!"
3,Decent,"The Ipod dock is okay. You get what you pay for. The sounds is pretty good for such small speakers, however, I get some sort of clicking sound every time a song changes (a little annoying, but again, you spend thats what you get for $65.00.)"
5,Great Little IPOD Docking System,"This IPOD docking speaker system has a great sound. For such a small unit, it packs a punch. Use it at work daily and plan to take it on vacations. It is small enough to put in my carry-on and has a great little carry case that I can store all my cords and IPOD in as well as the speaker system. No problems with it and feel I got a great price even though the price dropped a few dollars after the purchase."
1,inMotion iM5,I have had this product for less than a year and it has a short in it. The only thing it will do now is charge my Ipod. The speakers will not stay on for me to play my music. I'm so disappointed!
1,Speakers Died Within 5 Minutes Of First Use,"Well, for the first few minutes the sound was great. Then the speakers completely died. No sound. NNNo power. Nothing.I am very frustrated as I just received this in the mail today.I have contacted Dbroth for a refund request so I will post an update on how that goes."
4,"A Good Speaker, But Has Durability Issues","Overall, this is a great speaker system. Bass is strong for its size, midtones are good, and there is excellent treble. The speakers work better with my iPod, rather than other things connected via the AUX IN jack (ie CD player and other mp3 players). I think it might optimize the equalizer for the speakers on the iPod, because the bass does not sound as distorted and the high notes are crisper with the iPod as opposed to another player. I like the ability to attach other devices and a subwoofer to these too. However, they are not the most rugged speakers. I took them to the beach on vacation, and just from the salt in the air, the mesh on the speakers began to corrode and now I have brown speckles all over my speakers. Also, I think because I live in Colorado and the air is so dry, the rubber grips on the bottom and the rubber flap that covers the ports on the back are beginning to dry out and crumble. Otherwise, they are great speakers."
2,"Okay at first, aged quickly","I have had mine for 15 months, and it is going downhill fast. It interjects popping sounds. I have done many tests to isolate the source and it is definitely the Altec device. So, now 15 months later, I have to throw it out."
4,nice little speakers!,"I purchased these speakers for my grandaughter for Christmas, and she loves them. They are compact, and give good sound for the price."
1,bad product,"I had this product for about a year. In a review (which I deleted to give this updated review), I updated September 30, 2008, I wrote about how these speakers crapped out.After about a year they just stopped working. I would turn them on and after about 3-4 minutes, the speakers would just shut off. It would continue to charge my iPod but not play my iPod. So the speakers are USELESS! I still have speakers from table top systems 10 years old that still work, so this was disappointing.I have no problem with Altec but would never buy these speakers again!"
2,Employment Law for Business,"Employment Law for Business, 2nd Edition, is a text that covers legal topics such as; The Employer-employee Relationship, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Affirmative Action, Employment Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, Job Performance and Behavior, Rights of Privacy, Protection of Employee Safety, Income, Retirement, and Health. This is a good tool for managers."
5,It's The Duke!,Again it's John Wayne. It's American Western! It's right prevailing. Nothing to dislike. You can watch it over and over.
5,Chisum,"The very best of the ""Dukes"" Westerns with the possible exception of ""Red River"". This is the opinion of a working cowboy turned rancher."
5,John Wayne at his best. rough and ready!,"This is a great movie. Not only is it exciting but it is full of history. Telling the story of Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett. How New Mexico became settled and how a man who can start with just a small piece of land, through hard work, perserverance, honesty, and consideration for his fellow man could amass such land and respect from his neighbors. It is truly one of Wayne's best and certainly worth watching."
5,Great Movie,I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. He loves a lot of John Wayne's movies. The quality of this DVD is great. My husband really has enjoyed watching this movie.
4,classic duke,"This movie is classic Duke. I have collected other John Wayne movies and this has his usual company of actors.The clarity is excellent and the photography is great.While the actual history of Chisum differs from this screen version, it is a great story.I recommend this to any collector of the Duke's movies."
3,Could have Been a Lot Better,"Chisum shows John Wayne nearing the end of his great career and still great. The movie is superficially faithful to history - there was a Lincoln County War, John Chisum and Lawrence Murphy were the main antagonits. John Tunstall a supporter of Chisum was murdered, probably at Murphy's behest. And Pat Garrett and Billie the Kid were there and Bonney did seek out Chisum for help. And Billie did revere Tunstall. This is all in the movie, so the pieces were there for a truly great Western....But Billie the Kid is portrayed as just the nicest young man - in reality he was a pyschopathic killer. Maybe that's why the movie leaves out the showdown between Garrett and the Kid - they spent the whole movie being together on Chisum's side and are rivals only for the attention of Chisum's slightly ditzy niece."
3,Quite a few good shooting scenes + Awkwardly-fake fist fighting scenes + Beautiful landscapes + Lukewarm acting + Predictable,"- There are quite a few good shooting scenes.- The fist fighting scenes look so awkward that it's hilarious. They might look good during their time (1970) though.- The landscape is fantastic.- The acting is lukewarm- The movie is predictable just like most of others of this genre.In short, it's worth watching once."
3,CHISUM - The Duke does it his own way! Again!,"CHISUM is the kind of good, tough, old-fashioned western that Hollywood has apparently forgotten how to make. This film focuses on the Lincoln County land wars in New Mexico, featuring a look at the involvement of Billy the Kid. The performances are strong down the line, most notably John Wayne as John Chisum and Christopher George as ""Sheriff"" Dan Nodeen. Although the historical aspect of the film is dubious, and the plot is a patchwork rehash of many ""B"" westerns (with implied references to several of Wayne's previous westerns), the film is most enjoyable. Andrew V. Mc Laglen (the poor man's John Ford) does a commendable job of directing this ensemble of veteran and up-and-coming actors. While CHISUM does not rank among the BEST of the John Wayne westerns (such as The Searchers, Red River, etc...), it's still VERY entertaining and well worth watching."
4,The Duke Rides again,"Ok, so the historical aspect is questionable, so what? This is classic John Wayne, good guys against bad guys, and predictably great until the final reel. I always felt they left the door open a little for a sequel, or moreover that this was placing a John Wayne bootprint on the story behind the story of the Lincoln County War. Whichever way, I thoroughly enjoy this every time I see it. Probably not one of the ""GREAT"" John Wayne westerns, and I'm being a little generous with 4 stars, but the transfer quality to DVD makes it worth it, although there isn't any extra stuff. Just under two hours, and a little violent for very young children, otherwise Enjoy"
1,Chisum Movie Too Far Off,"This has to be the worst view of a real character Hollywood, and especially John Wayne, ever produced. The names I recognize, but the story is so far off. They could have named it something else, and used a fictional character. Chisum's life is interesting enough w/o pasting it with so many falsehoods, including his relationship or non-relationship with William Bonney. I tried to watch it after so many years, but it was like Home from the Hill....really worthless except for the background scenery."
4,The Duke,"As an admirer of John Wayne I still select what movies I collect for my hobby, Chisum I haven't seen in years and what I can remember I enjoyed the acting and storyline. The show is something that sits in the back of your mind, waiting to be watched again and not forgotton that easily, so when I'm in the mood I will collect my sweets and pillow sit on the chair and relax, watch a great movie with good actors making you feel your with them involved with everything, Making my night unusal to others nights. Great western different to most others that I have seen. The scenery is wonderful and the dvd is a treasure to own, So sit back and enjoy. Robyn"
5,great movie,"So i love John Wayne movies i have probley a good dozen or so of i would consider his best work. This movie has everything ""Billy the Kid"" and ""The Duke"" i dont really know what more could be asked for in a western."
3,Chisum DVD Review,"Typical John Wayne movie--simple-minded and predictable, but watchable. The widescreen picture is enhanced for 16:9 TVs and is of excellent clarity and sharpness."
1,tommy,"video is scratched badly, cannot watch it. I would return it but cost that same in postage as the product so no gain, I just lost out."
3,Should not be rated G,"This is a great movie, but it should not be rated G. I'm not sure how this happened, but it has a lot of profanity in it. Do not buy this thinking that it is free of foul language."
2,Does not play,"I got this dvd for my step father and had it sent to his address. He watched it 2 times and after that it stopped playing. It said on his tv screen ""cannot display feature"". What gets me is he waited for 30 days to complain about it which seems odd to me especially when the dvd worked before. He did take the dvd to his friends place to have him play it on his DVD player and it would not play there either. I don't know whether to believe him or not. He took it to Fred Myers in WA they tried playing it and it wouldn't. According to him there are no scratches or smudges on the disk. So am I out $10 (includes shipping) for a defective disk or am I being strung along by my step father? I am not going to be ordering DVD's anymore for him his word is questionable at best it has always has been. No offence towards you. I would still order from you if it were a DVD for myself."
1,Don't buy this Movie,"I am a huge fan of almost anything with John Wayne in it, especially westerns. But this may be one of his worst. The Duke had a maddening habit of surrounding himself with bad actors. But often the movie was good enough to overcome this fault. This one is not. The music is flat out horrible, almost funny it's so bad, and the script is rediculous. It is historically inaccurate, and if you are going to make a movie with real charactors in it, then this is not a minor fault. The only good things in the movie are Ben Johnson and the Duke himself. Truly one of his worst."
5,Doesn't deserve to be forgotten,"Phil Ochs does not have the lasting fame he deserves. The topics of his songs may be aged, but, in one way or another, they're still revelant. ""I Ain't Marching Anymore"" is an excellent, timeless tribute to nonviolence. ""The Draft Dodger Rag"" is great (even catchy), and his version of Noyes' poem ""The Highway Man"" shows off his excellent ballad-singing voice, as accompanied by beautiful acoustic guitar. These are indeed the ""Days of Decision."" Decide to buy this album today."
5,A brilliant and powerful album,"Phil Ochs/ I Ain't Marching Anymore: This album (along with his ""All the news that's fit to sing"" album) is the very definition of the ""protest song"". The subject matter is certainly rooted in the 1960's but that does not mean that the songs are no longer relevant. Some of these songs are universal. Others, though dated, remain important even today. Beyond that, this album is inspiring, encouraging, and entertaining. This is a Great album that deserves to be made available on a continual basis and not just once every five years."
2,"Do you really want a ""best of"" CD?","This is a ""best of"" disk. If you have other Chandra cds forget this one. It would make a great gift, though. It has (by my count) 5 cuts from 'weaving my ancestors"" and only 2 new cuts. Insofar as I am concerned it is a ripoff. I agree with what others say about the sublime quality of her voice and the deeply spiritual nature of the music."
1,Not what I'd hoped for,"I recently discovered Shelia Chandra's music on her ""Quiet"" album, and was riveted by her mesmerizing lyrical talents and the meditative quality of the music she created. I then purchased Roots And Wings, and was equally pleased with the more varied tracks, but the same hauntingly beautiful lyrical quality and fascinating use of non-word 'bols'. So in my eagerness to add to my Shelia Chandra library, I ordered ""Moonsung"", and was terribly disappointed. Insteaded of hauntingly beautiful, I found it to be just haunting. Granted, this is a totally different style than the 2 aforementioned albums, but it did not give me the same peaceful, energized feeling...intead it just left me annoyed and depressed. Not my cup of tea, but perhaps others would like it. I recommend you listen to the clips before purchasing, since not all albums from the same artist will contain the same style of music."
1,you seem to have lost touch with music.,you should stick more to classical music. your voice is being wasted in your compositions.
1,No so good,I purchased this set for my 5 year old son. At first it worked okay. The cars are a bit slow and they don't stay charged up for too long but it seemed to work fine. Yet...... after a few days the cars would run on the straight track but not on the turns. You pretty much had to push it along. Sometimes they won't even go on the straight track. For the price of this item It's not worth the aggravation. Needless to say this is going back to the store. Save your money!!!
5,WOW! great CD!,"I bought 2 copys & this is there best, by far!A drunk for a Father & a night hooker for a Mother & normal kid came from this.This is by far thier best work."
4,Escape Velocity,"Fantastic! Christopher Stasheff has done it again; the wizard of fantasy has proved his mastery of science fiction in a fascinating reality. This explains the origins of the Gramarye colony featured in the Warlock series, complete with a few puns. I highly recommend it."
2,"Not bad, but dated","The writing style is very choppy and too many assumptions are made of the reader. However, I like good sci-fi, and this has some good ideas in it. You will have to read the book to find out what they are, as I won't spoil it for you. Certainly a good book to inspire an RPG session (or campaign).In summary I would say that this is a decent book, worth reading if you have some spare time and plan to read the rest of the Warlock series. I would not put it at the top of my list, except that it is very short and a quick read."
1,Disappointment,"I expected so much from Stasheff. I was severely disappointed. Very boring. Put me to sleep. I'm glad he improved with the rest of the series, but if I'd gotten this one first I doubt I would have followed up."
5,Excellent Book for Kids,"This is not only a compelling story, but helps encourage environmental awareness amongst kids. I bought it for my son on a whim and he absolutely devoured it. The characters are believably independent and I really appreciated their investigative styles. Kids need to think for themselves and this is a sweet, lively book that encourages such thinking with some very positive results. I highly recommend it."
2,Disappointing product from prestigious firm,"The Sjoberg Elite workbeach is highly rated in a review by Fine Woodworking. However, I reluctantly agree with the other reviewer. The accessory storage case is way overpriced. And, as the other reviewer noted, it requires a great deal of work with handplanes to fit the drawers. Also, the packaging was poor. Given its weight, the packaging, expecially the corners, should have been far more robust. Mine was damaged in shipping. Amazon offered to replace it without charge but, when I said I didn't want to go through all that, they volunteerd to knock some off the price to compensate for the damage. By all means, buy the Elite Bench itself, but consider making a compatible case of drawers yourself."
4,great pan at a great price,"I'm no gourmet cook, but I do cook. I bought this & the 1.5qt to replace saucepans my mother had given me some 30 yrs ago. I had considered the ""popular"" brands (Caphalon, Cuisinart, Emeril, Analon, etc.) and just wasn't finding what I wanted in open stock. I wanted pots with straining lids so that narrowed my search. I was pleasantly surprised when I found these, because they were the sizes I wanted, the style I liked, a very reasonable price AND made in the U.S.A!You should note that the interior is not SS finish - it is aluminum. the outside is SS and the lid is SS finish. The holes are large enough that thin spaghetti will slip thruogh when straining, but you can turn the lid so the holes are not at the very bottom of the spout and still get pretty good straining results. Note if you're considering the 3.5 qt. model: I think it would be too heavy for me to strain if filled with water/pasta."
4,Very useful,"We use this pot constantly - it's a good size, heats fast, and cleans easily. I love the pour spouts on each side for their functionality, but be aware that because they create indentations in the rim liquid does boil over the sides much more readily than with other pans. They also make the pan not really suitable for long cooking, since steam escapes even with the lid on.The strainer in the lid is also very useful - no more colanders! - but not for spaghetti. In order for the holes to be large enough for the pot to quickly drain, they're large enough for some spaghetti or linguini strands to slip through."
5,Great addition,Very nice pan with even cooking. The sides are great for pouring and straining. Very pleased.
2,Only Cover Versions Of Hits!,"""Only Hits"" is one of the least essential records in the vast catalog of albums by the Ventures. I never particularly liked the albums where the Ventures only covered the various hits of the day, without any underlying theme or concept. Stylistically, the songs are all over the place. ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" starts the album off on a strong note, and compares favorably to the jazzy version of the song by Deodato. On the other hand, ""Oh Babe, What Would You Say"" is embarrassingly bad. The rest of the songs fall somewhere in-between. The biggest weakness of the album is the fact that there are no original instrumentals included. Some critics fail to note that members of the Ventures have written many instrumentals over the years. ""Only Hits"" reinforces the misconception that the Ventures are only a cover band. This is one CD where the best songs are the 4 bonus tracks."
4,Stubbornness does give you strength,Would've given4 and a half! Writing styles very different took alittle while to get used to. Some ideas a little hard to grasp?... But like I said first time reading him definetly gonna read the whole series!!
3,Not sure what to make of this,"Let me start by saying i am a big King fan. However, now that i have finished this book i am at a loss. Not sure what to make of it. I will say this, I do intend to move forward on the second book er chapter er whatever they call it."
5,wonderful perforance of excellent songs,"I'm a neophyte to Ned Rorem's work. To be honest I purchased this CD because I really enjoy listening to Susan Graham. Although I really love hearing Ms. Graham's opera performances, I find it refreshing to hear her singing something in English. I also appreciate how she's taken time to perform something other than opera. Susan Graham's performance of Ned Rorem's songs has me seeking out other performances of his work."
1,boring,"I don't know what the hype about Susan Graham is, a more generic voice is not imaginable. Forget this CD."
5,"A very ""lush"" book.","As everyone knows, Mr. Colin Glencannon, Chief Engineer of the Inchcliffe Castle, could ignore just about anything...with a ""wee drap"" of Dugan's Dew of Kirkintilloch. I first read the Glencannon stories in the '60s and they have never failed to amuse me."
3,The answer to your questions.,It is a CD single with one song on it from the Loops of Fury single. And it is also a book. It has a discography and tells a little about the Chems. I know that it is several pages long. Just remember that the CD only has one song on it.
3,????,"I don't own this release, and I don't know what it is. Does anyone out there know what this mighht be? Is this actually representative of some rare Chemical Brothers record, or is Amazon just fooling us? Help!!!"
1,Wasted time,"Totally unbelievable, depressing,and poorly written. It was wery hard to follow the conversations It was hard to think of such weak,and in someways,cruel women."
2,"Suddenly, I Feel Quite Blue...","I'm sorry to say, I just did not enjoy this book much. I felt the author's writing style was too jumbled and her thoughts just didn't flow freely enough for me. It almost felt like several authors were writing as one and I was getting bits and pieces of different people's imagination. I think I would have enjoyed this book much more if it would have been free flowing rather than choppy.I never could connect with any characters simply because the author didn't *open them up enough* for me. The only character that seemed real, in my opinion, was the father.There was way too much drama in this one family and I didn't feel it touched on the proper (realistic) emotions that your average person feels during these situations. I wanted to like this book ~ I really did. But, it just made me feel ....... a little bit blue!"
1,ladle separated after only a few uses,"The ladle separated from the actual stem on thanksgiving day :/ bit of a downer, very nice looking product but needs some quality control checks..."
2,egyptian tortoise video,hi i have watch lots of videos and i really didnt like this one we all know that this tortoise is in danger but i bougth this video to learn more on breeding and it really dont tell you much what i saw was what i could have learnd from the internet i am sorry that other people speak well of this but not me thanks richie schray
4,A Literary Gem,"This book really helps one to not only understand what Power really is, but to easily increase one's own personal power. Skim the first few pages that cover the conventional and inadequate definitions of power, and then get to the real meat of this short, but clear and powerful work. I recommend this to aspiring and current managers and leaders in business as well as those to seek to become more effective in their own lives."
5,"Jazz.......Mmm, great.","I feel slightly filthy having embraced that cliched phrase for a title, but it is, and yes it's that too. Everyone who knows of Wes' playing will recognise the thumb picked liquidity of the solo runs and the octave styling so indicative of this master. If you like the style, you'll like the album. Technically acomplished and polished as well as sound, an all too uncommon combination. Great."
4,well arranged classic jazz songs,"I have just begun to check out jazz music, and I have several cd's that I enjoy particularly, in the Miles Davis vein of jazz. This is one of those, and though I don't find it quite as good as Miles (who is, anyway?) I appreciate it for its lush melodies and perfect arrangements. It is very well made, and though it occasionally skirts muzak territory, it avoids it by virtue of Wes's octave-heavy guitar work. I heard somewhere that Wes and company kind of sort of helped create the muzak genre, and I would say that that might be true, unfortunately. I prefer rock music in general, but if you are willing to branch out a little, this might be your cup of tea. enjoy!"
3,Had higher expections,"So after having my jeep lifted for a couple yrs and just using the regular track bar and repairing it here and there every once in a while I bought this bracket assuming it would fix my clicking sound at fulling turning the wheels and so I would have to keep repairing my trackbar. But shorting after installing it and a new tracking bar, I still get the clicking sound when I fully turn my wheels and the trackbar already needs to be repaired. So I guess I'm just going to have to go to an adjustable trackbar."
1,It doesn't come in a left hand model,Please let me know where I can find a left handed swing sock? I have three left handed friends and I want to give a sock to each one for Christmas
2,So far so good but format is almost unreadable,"I'm only about 30% through the book (according to my Kindle) but the grammar is so bad it's hard to get through. I'm new to Hugo's work so I'm getting used to much of the vocab but many words are misspelled, the punctuation is horrible. I know it only cost 2 bucks but I wish I just got the hard copy.Just an example, I don't even know which is the correct word although I can make a good guess. Within two paragraphs a society is called the: Eveche, Fiveche, iSveche, etc.Abbe Sieyes is called Sieves at some points.That being said, the story is good so far! (I just need to keep a dictionary handy!)"
2,False advertising verging on fraudulence,"Billed on Amazon as ""Affordable & High Quality Paperback Edition"", the book is certainly affordable, but the only thing high quality about it is the glossy cover. It appears to have been generated by photo copying a book bearing the stamp ""Harvard College Library, Sheldon Fund, July 10, 1940"", and the library file number ""41573.182"". The copying was very poorly done, capturing all the defects of the worn original, including smudges, dog ears, tears, etc. I wish I had paid a bit more for a better version of this book.Ninety-Three"
2,Beware of this publisher,Many pages have missing words where poor photocopy was used...some of the edges of pages do not line up correctly with rest of paragraphs/sentences. This also occurred on another book I purchased from same publisher.
2,Inexpensive and it seems to show,"The good: a relatively rare title in the US as a physical book either used or new, this is a bargain e-book at $2.00. Bought it for Kindle on iPad.The bad: Maybe it was the Kindle software for iPad but I have never seen a more poorly designed ""book"" from a typography standpoint. Very strange layout and fonts. It does not bring pleasure to the eye, alas."
2,Real thing please...,"My son is 17 months old and we decided to try the leap pad. Although the on-off button and volume controls were loads of fun for him, he did not enjoy the toy at all. He was unabe to get most of the object's attached sounds to work, and was unenthusiastic about the reading ""voice"". He would turn it off and instead ask me to read to him with out the distraction of the toy. I am taking it to the resale store today."
2,"Poor design, poor product","If your child is a leapfrog button pushing kid, SKIP THIS TOY!!!! Who had the bright idea of the sound and on/off being green buttons on a white field right on the front?????? All she wants to do is push the buttons!!!! Once she turns it off I have to reset it with the green go circle on the side of the page, etc. She did not care about it at, then she wanted to just rip the books off. She is strong but can not trigger the page noises. The toy is just a dud. Buy the 2 leapfrog movies instead, those are great. All I do with this toy is scold her not to rip on the books or push the buttons. No fun for either of us."
2,"Good idea, bad product","My daughter who is 17 months old, has every leap frog learning toy made. I was so excited about this product...until I got it home. My daughter had a very hard time understanding what to do. She ended up pulling off the book and just pressing the pad. The concept is great, but the actual toy isn't."
2,Not for a liitle touch,"I bought the Little Touch leap pad system for my 2 year old daughter. However, she cannot play with it by herself! I need to do the touching because she does not lean hard enough on the pictures. She gets frustrated while trying to do so.She has a much easier time with her brother's ""My First Leap Pad"""
2,"Has potential, but not yet . . .","I gave this a better rating for educational value because I believe it will be beneficial . . . someday. For now, my 13-month old is more interested in pushing the on/off and volume control buttons. We have been unable to get through a whole book because of this. If I cover the buttons with my hand, he just gets mad and screams and then has no patience to play with the book. Maybe I just have an active boy, or maybe this is not age-appropriate. Kids today are technology driven and if there is a button to push, they will find it. Future re-design should put the power and volume controls well out of sight."
1,Go for a book instead,"While the Little Touch is certainly a nice product, it requires significant parent involvement and does not seem to hold the attention of a toddler (<18mo)nearly as well as a traditional book. The pad is not sensitive enough to a young child's touch and the books are somewhat flimsy. I recommend taking the $... you would spend on this platform and the accompanying software and ordering a bunch of ""old fashion"" books instead."
2,Ok toy but not within the age guidelines,"We bought this toy for our son when he was 8 months old. Leap Frog has on the box that this is for 6-36 months. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY FOR AN INFANT! As usual for Leap Frog they have made a great product but have rated it for too young an age. Yeah, it makes noise but thats it and unfortunatley thats not enough to keep our sons attention even with us trying to make a big deal out of it. He just tries to crawl off our lap. I think one reason that he is so disinterested in this toy is that he cannot interact with it. The touch pad isn't sensitive enough for little fingers. You really have to push hard and you have to press exactly on the object which is hard for an 8 month old, especially when it is asking him to press the red triangle. I do think that he will enjoy this in about another year though so for now we have put it up in his closet and are just sticking to the board books."
4,Too busy turning it off and on...,I bought this for my daughter who is 1 1/2 for Christmas last year and haven't been able to get through the book yet. She is too fascinated with pushing the on and off button. I wish they would of put the button out of sight so it isn't such a distration.My 3 1/2 year old son plays with it and is suited much better for an older child.
1,Too advanced for my child at 24 months.,"This is supposed to be fit for a child that is 6 months to 36 months???? My little guy will have it destroyed by the time he is actually able to sit and play with it. He has had it since 12 months and is now 22 months, and does nothing but pull the books out of the game because they come out so easily... They should be pages made of hard plastic that cannot come out once you put them in. Then the cards were a joke. Too floppy and flimsy. He also pulls the cartridges out. Turns the button on and off, off... I would NOT recommened spending $30.00 plus dollars on this, not to mention the cost of buying each individual cartridge.... I think any parent would be highly disapointed with this..."
5,TRY DOING IT TOGETHER,TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT IT IS NOT FOR LITTLE ONES ..IT IS REALLY A TOY MEANT TO DO TOGETHER..JUST LIKE READING TO A CHILD..ONLY THIS TOY HAS A LITTLE MORE EXCITEMENT IN IT WITH ITS MUSIC ETC..IT SHOULD BE A TOY WITH DOWN TIME WITH YOUR CHILD..MY SON JUST TURNED ONE AND LOOKS AT BOOKS ALL THE TIME..THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT TOY FOR ME TO DO BEDTIME STORIES..AGAIN THIS TOY IS ALL ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT..
3,Wasn't worth it.,"We purchased this toy for our DD when she was 1 year old. She is now 5, we have another child who is 3 and neither of them have really cared for this toy.It is awkward to use. Sometimes you can press right over a symbol and get no response. That is frustrating for a toddler. This requires a lot of help and IMO you may as well forgo the electronic experience and just buy a lot of books in place of this gadget. When you think of the cost of buying this, and the cartridges...you could have quite a nice library of books bought for the same amount of money. (especially if you use Amazon's 4 for 3!)If I had it to do over again I would have found one for sale at a yard sale to see if the kids would use it. Seems there is a glutton of used ones out there..."
1,Don't waste your money,This product was put together by a monkey that never had kids. If you buy the additonal books and cards you will never know what activity card goes with what cartridge. Leap Frog will offer no help with this. I called the help desk and they said good luck with that. It is to hard for a child of the 6-36 months to press the keys. Your child won't be able to push the object.
1,definetely not for babies,"Manufacturer recommends to start using this toy from 6 months of age. We bought if for our 10-months old son because he loves books. This toy is definetely not age-appropriate for him even if an adult plays with him--the 'touch' does not work, its hard to press even for a grown-up, the pages are flimsy and he is jamming and tearing them, so there goes this toy in the closet for a long time since my baby is not able to play with it. LeapFrog should either adjust the 'touch' or the recommended age. This toy should be recommended starting approximately 18 months of age. Two thumbs down..."
3,Disappointed,"We bought this for our daughter's first birthday. I was disappointed because its difficult to press on the pages and get the response - you have to press hard. My older daughter (three years old) has learned to press with pressure, and now that my younger daughter is 15 months old she is beginning to be able to press with success too, but its not consistent. This is definitely a toy to do together as the young kids do not understand the concept of pressing a green Go circle for each page. I also agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that young kids tend to turn the pages (which are made out of a heavier paper, but definitely can be wrinkled), or press buttons faster than the Touch Pad can keep up with. I think you may as well wait until the kids are two to purchase this - or just wait a few more months past age two and buy the LeapPad meant for ages 3 and up."
2,A disappointment,"I purchased this toy for my then 14 month old(shes 16 months now) I thought it would be a fun activity to do duringthe day with the nanny. Needless to say we were VERY disappointed!first of all the Snap in book comes offtoo easily, however i find the pages of the book to be quite sturdy. Also the tabs on the activity cards are too short and dont stay in place .When my daughter tries to press on the bookto hear a sound she CANT PRESS HARD ENOUGH, and she gets upset and frustrated& starts just punching and banging on it.Also the ON/OFF and volume buttons should be hidden in the back of the toy because the most fun my daughter hasis pressing those two buttons. Dont get this for Christmas, just wait for the child to get older and get the regular leap pad."
2,For a Leap Pad product - kinda disappointed,"I got this for my son who is 22 months old to help keep him busy in the car. I must say I'm rather disappointed.One of the problems we had was the on and off button is too easy for little ones to access and operate and when the system gets turned off and then back on YOU must then restart up the system.And, as easy as the on and off button is to operate - the opposite must be said for the use of the pages. Most of the time my son hits things on the page and gets no response and after a few tries ends up in his frustration."
3,TOO HARD TO PUSH,"My daughter got this toy at 12 months old she loves it!! It makes fun sounds, but she can not push the buttons herself even now at 18 months old. She pulls the books and cartridges out very easily, and then gets frustrated because it wont work. To get it to play you have to turn it on, push the green go button pick a setting, all a little to advanced for children, and the pad is very difficut to activate even for me, esp for toddlers, but when I am with her she does have a lot of fun, I wish it were easier to activate."
3,"For younger children, yes...","This toy ""assists"" you in reading to your child by adding music and someone else's voice. I guess by putting it on a leap pad, it should be more fun. We have more fun simply reading a book than dealing with this toy.It's also not built well for the age group. Either the kids are too young to push hard enough on the items in order to get the right answer, or they are too old, and are ready for the Leap Pad with the pen.I should have gotten the ""My first leap Pad"" instead. If your child does well with a ""pen"", I'd go the next level up."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she has played with it every day since then. My daughter absolutely loves this. We enjoy reading this together. On the first couple of pages she has a hard time pushing hard enough, but the rest of the pages are just fine. It gives a lot of room for parental involvement. It might not be usable for younger children, but I would highly recommend it for 18 months and up."
3,Can't Touch This,"I don't have very much new to say. My 3-year-old can't even push on the Little Touch Leap Pad hard enough to make it work let alone my 13-month-old. I have to say though, my 3-year-old has the Leap Pad for older kids (NOT My First Leap Pad, but Leap Pad) and my 13-month-old was using the stylus to make the Leap Pad work, so save yourself some money and get the Leap Pad which they can play with until they are 8 or so."
3,Recommend,"Although I find it fun and highly educational, my 20 month old daughter doesn't seem to care for it too much. It may be that it doesn't respond to her touch fast enough or that it is not sensitive enough. She gets frustrated and moves on to her more traditional toys."
4,"NIce idea, but a little tough for the younger ones","I was so excited to find this toy! Designed for 6mos and up, it is a very nice toy. HOwever, I did find a few problems with it as well. My daughter is 14 mos and I bought this for her at about 11 mos. I bought a few of the books and cards as well. She is very interested in it and I DO NOT USE IT as a babysitter!! I sit with her and we read and ""try"" to push buttons. However, I do find pushing the ""go"" button for each page is a pain and she is not quite strong enough to push the things on the screen to make them sound. So, she is easily frustrated by this. Also, the cards (not the books-they snap into place) come loose easily and fall out if she tries to push the buttons for this. ALthough this is a great idea, I think it needs to be more sensitive to the touch in order to be more effective."
1,take a pass,We purchased this toy when my daughter was 15mo old and like other readers have taken it out 1/month for the last 9 months. She is now 2 years old and still would much rather read real books w/ me or bang on the on/off button and then put the toy away. I am surprised that any parent would rather use an electronic toy vs's sitting down with good old fashion (and inexpensive) books! It is a waste of money.
1,Not age appropriate.,"My son received this toy from Grandma for Christmas. He was 8 months old. He showed no interest in it. Once a month since then, I have brought it out and used it with him. He could care less. Being an early childhood education major, my advice is to buy the real book, sit down with yoru child, and read it yourself. You can make you own games and songs based on the stories. It makes the time spent more meaningful."
2,Very Disappointed,"I love most of the Leap Forg toys but this is the worst. We bought this about 4-5 months ago when my daughter was 13-14 months old and although she found it interesting she was drawn to the on/off button and the volume button which is very obvious and big. So most of the time, even when we are just starting in on a book she starts with the on/off constantly! She is 19 months now and still this interests her more than anything. She operates 90% of her toys by herself but this is not one that she could because of the &amp;quot;GO&amp;quot; button mentioned by another reviewer. You have to hit it EVERY SINGLE TIME you turn the page or want to use the page on the opposite side which is very annoying for me even. I think even in a year when she will be able to do that by herself she would get bored with it very easily and just move on to something else. I say wait until they are ready for the step-up version Leap Pad."
1,Horrible!!!!!!,Came scratched up missing pieces and no instructions!! I just tossed it in the garbage would have been a waste of time trying to return!! Definitely won't use this buyer EVER again!!! When I contacted the buyer about this product they were very rude!!
2,A Bit of a disappointment,"this seems like a marvelous toy, but we have been quite disappointed in it. My son received it last Christmas and it has never been a big hit. it is just too difficult for a child under 3 to understand the concepts of changing settings, pressing the ""go"" circle each time you turn the page and of course little hands are going to pull the story book cards out. frankly, likes his Clifford the Big Red Dog regular books much better. Think very seriously before you invest, because of course it only comes with one book. wish we has skipped this one."
2,Too hard for 15 month old,It is too hard for my son to push on the page (especially in the middle). He gets very frustrated with the toy and spends most of the time pressing on/off.
2,Not user friendly,"I was very impressed by rhe features of the product, and decided to try it out for my 11 month girl. Now, even at 21 months, she finds it difficult to press. The cartridge is easily removable, so most of the time, she just takes it out and presses the on off switch. Its fun, only when I press the pictures on the book, so that they make sound. It can't be called little touch - its better being called mummy touch leappad.. The product has not lived up to the expectation. My friend bought it, and her baby also is not enjoying it all."
2,Think again...,The idea for this product is great. But you have to push down so hard on the board for it to work. I'm very disappointed. My 1 year old prefers to play with the Fischer-price touch board instead.My 3 year old loves the writing leap pad...that one is a winner.
3,Too complicated for age recommended,"We bought this toy for my daughter's first birthday since it was recommended for kids 1+, she's now almost 2 and still has hardly played with it! It's way too complicated, although a neat idea. There is no way to explain to a 1 year old to press the *green go button* everytime she turns the page"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.,"You know that feeling that you get when you're driving and someone zooms up from behind at warp speed and starts tailgating you? Well, take that feeling and apply it towards education and the result is this toy. Besides having terribly difficult areas to push on the page, the thing wants your child to answer the question NOW NOW NOW DOITDOITDOIT PRESS IT NOW. The only shared experience this will give between parent and child is aggravation. Actually sitting down and reading a book with your child and asking simple context questions is more relaxing, rewarding, and cheaper than this totally useless (and expensive) piece of garbage. (And I do agree with one of the previous reviewers in saying the only redeeming quality in this thing is that it is durable, which is good, since the common reaction to it seems to be wanting to throw it across the room.)"
1,Not what you'd think,"Although the idea of this toy is a great one it really isn't designed for young children. It advertises for babies and toddlers, however, this is not the case once you get it home. The trick to getting the pages to coordinate with the vocal reader is to make sure that the GO button is pushed when you turn the page. The button is located to the side of each page, however, anyone who can teach a busy child to touch that button (and hard enough) every time they turn the page has my vote for parent of the year. What ends up happening is that the child keeps turning pages, but the sounds do not follow along and suddenly your child is pointing at a dog and the voice is saying --Great that's the color blue!-- They could have done a better job with this one.I brought it back the next day....."
2,Extremely DISAPPOINTED!,"I bought this item for my daughters first birthday and what a DISAPPOINTMENT! The on and off buttons are in the absolute worst place on top and in the front. What baby doesn't like to push buttons?!?! So she is constantley turning it on and off. Then once we do get started the talking takes forever and she has already lost interest. Also, the touch pages are hard for her as you need to push it right on the ""sensitive part of the picture""."
3,not for kids 6 months old,"My son (now 11 months) still doesn't show any interest in this toy (we got it when he was about 6 moths old), but he doesn't show much interest in books at all yet. He just likes to turn pages and the pages on this toy aren't easy to turn. Maybe he'll like it more as he gets older."
1,Don't waste your money,We have many Leap Frog products that we are happy with but this isn't one of them. It is to hard for a child to follow or interact with. You have to hold the pages down to keep young hands from turning to the wrong page. There are to many options to touch which makes it hard for a child to follow. It just doesn't flow very well. Our daughter just wants to push the On/Off button. We both get much more out of siting down and reading a book the old fashion way.
1,Better for older kids....,"My son received this as a gift when he was about 10 months old. He's now almost 2 and still does not use it. He'll sit on my lap and I can use it with him, but I'd rather read a regular story to him. I think in another year he may be more into it."
1,Dissappointed- toy not designed well,"I bought this for my 15 month old son and I hate it. The activity cards and books don't attach well enough, so my son ends up pulling them off. I would advise against buying this product."
2,Too tough for a little one...,"If your kid is like mine, he knows what buttons do...press it and it does something. Unfortunately, the only ""button"" on this toy is the On/Off and Volume button. As for the rest of the ""touch"" features, it requires a very strong touch to get any results. I do not recommend this toy for a toddler...it's not a play on your own type toy...it requires an adult to press the leappad and get the story moving. Also, the book pages are a bit flimsy and rip/bend easily, making it difficult to fit them properly into the leappad."
1,A Disappointment,"I am a big fan of Leap Frog products- we have many. I was surprised and disappointed to find that this does not live up to the company's reputation. The pad is hard to activate. It doesn't need a ""little touch"" at all, it needs a very firm push from an adult. The settings are confusing and the pages are too thin. Even though this product is not a good one, the company makes many other great products."
3,Made for older children.,My 16 month old almost destroyed it in the first 5 minutes by crushing the pages. They need to be laminated or thicker or something. Really for older children that don't want to chew on it.
2,LittleTouch is out of Touch,"I was a little disappointed with this product. I have a now one year old and an 8 year old. My 8 yr. old has had the LeapPad for a couple of years and we love it. My 1 yr. old has had the LittleTouch LeapPad since he was 6 mos. and although the stories are cute and fun, the books themselves are no good. I'm not sure what they were thinking when they made these. They are flimsy paper books for babies! Babies who like to chew, crinkle, tear, and drool on to say the least. I wish they would consider atleast laminating the pages. So if your baby doesn't grab at anything then this toy is great for you, otherwise its not!!"
2,"Great idea, but does not work for babies","I bought it for my daughter when she was 10 months old. Initially, she was always able to take the activity cards and the book out of it. So, I put it away for a while and then took it out again when she turned one. Now, she can even take the cartridge out. She loves books and spends much time of the day flipping through picture books or asking me to read them to her. This toy is a great idea but I can't get her to use it the way its supposed to be used. She keeps on wanting to flip pages and gets impatient because the narration doesn't follow her. I thought that may be the powertouch system from Fisher Price may be better for her, but I just saw that it also has bad reviews. I guess, I just need to keep reading to her myself."
1,worst Leapfrog product I've purchased,We have purchased several Leapfrog products for our son who is now 17 months old. This is the most disappointing product we own. My son enjoys the book but becomes very impatient with having to wait for me to push the GO button. There are also times when he touches something and it hits the GO on another page or it accidentally changes the setting. There are times when he starts to really enjoy the book but then he'll become frustrated with one of it's many flaws. When we purchased this product we bought several books to go along with it. I opened most of them the day we bought it. The other day I returned the only one that we didn't open. Overall I'm just very disappointed in this product. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's just not worth it.
1,Don't Waste your money!!!,Who was stupid enough to make the pages so thin and easily rippable for such little ones??? They are just made from paper. Don't we buy board books for very small kids so the pages don't get ruined? Also the buttons are very hard to push.
2,Not for younger kids who want to 'do it themselves',"I got this for my son when he was 14 months. It is not a toy (at that age or younger) that you will be able to give to them to play with.Having to press 'go' everytime you turn a page is a pain and in narration mode the music plays too long after pressing go, before the narration starts. By then my son is ready to turn the page.My son is not really interested in this toy. I expect as he gets older he may like it better.As far as using it for a younger child as a way to read books, I think it is much more beneficial for them to hear your voice then to use something like this.Save your $$ and get him one of the other Leap Frog toys when he is older!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FOR A BABY!!!,"Our eighteen month old RIPPED the pages on these books! Now, why would Leap Frog, usually a great company, make a baby book from paper pages??? Our baby also turns the book on and off constantly. There should be a switch that only parents can turn it on/off."
3,It's ok...,"My son got this as a gift last Christmas (my son was 1 1/2 at the time). However... it never really got his attention. We bought new books hoping that would help but this ""toy"" just sits on the floor of his playroom and hardly ever gets touched. I've sat with him and tried the ""together"" approach... all he was interested in doing was turning the system on and off. Personally having owned this for awhile now (my son is now almost 2 1/2) I would not recommend this toy to anyone. I would start with the ""My 1st Leappad"" instead. Still... this is just a personal opinion. I love the Leappad products and will continue working with my son on this system but come Christmas we are replacing it with a ""My 1st Leappad"". Good Luck!"
3,Fun with Mom and Dad!!,"My 15 month old daughter actually received 2 of these for Christmas. So far she's hit-or-miss with this. You have to press to hard for her to do it herself yet. She does like the music and songs. It's great as long as we're with her. I think when she's a little older it will be good for her to play with alone.Overall, I think it's a great toy and I recommend it!"
4,Wonderful learning toy for interacting with baby,"We received this as a gift, and I was skeptical at first because of some reviews. However, our little guys loves sitting with us and playing with these books. At first, it was just the sounds, but now he is starting to follow the stories. It is not a substitute for reading time, but it is a wonderful interactive toy. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that we occasionally find it hard to push in exactly the right place. This has not hampered the fun we have with it. We use three different books, but we are planning to buy more soon."
3,Not for young toddlers,"I agree with some of the other reviewers about this being too hard for younger children certainly not for an 18month old. If you want to sit the child on your lap and interact with baby and you push the pictures thats one thing but, certainly not a toy your young child can play alone. My 3yr old is just now really getting into this toy, and I too bought it when he was around 18months. I think its age recommendation should be more like 2 1/2 -3yrs."
2,"Too Complicated and Hard to ""Touch""","My daughter received this as a gift last Holiday (she was 18 months old) due to the ""raves"" of another shopper. She loves books and electronic things. Well, now she's 2 1/2 and has very little interest in this due to many reasons... 1) too many ""steps"" to get started; 2) she just pushes the on/off button thinking it's the green ""go"" button; 3) this ""little touch"" is way too hard for her. She pushes and pushes and nothing. I have to push very hard for anything to make a sound. This is ONLY a parent/child electronic book. And when you have a 2 1/2 year old, she wants to do everything herself. So, now this ""expensive"" book is now going in the ""giveaway"" pile."
1,"didn't like it at all, my daughter could not use it","This is very hard to use for the recommended age 6 months to 3 years. It is heavy and the books are flimsy and can tear fast. My daughter hardly ever touched this thing. We just got her the ""My first leappad"" and she loves that one (she is 2). It is smaller and a lot easier to handle. The little touch leap pad was a waste of money. Just read a book to your little one or talk to your little one about pictures in the books and you'll be much better off."
3,Again Leap Frog fails me...,"Another christmas gift for my 1 year old now 20 months... he goes nuts with the volume controll, I tried to use it in the car while I drove, so he would have some entertainment... DONT DO IT.. I kept reaching back to reset it for each page.. not safe!! this is another toy you have to sit with them to get it to work, my son who is very independent, hates when I try to get it working for him, he gets upset with me and switches to another page... so for US its not good... if your child likes to sit in your lap and lets you turn the pages this would be great... I like that they have Dr Suese books for this! thats a + but I have only found Mr Brown can Moo... dont know if there are others and we are not getting any more leap frog items... I hope this review helps someone with a child like mine... also very durable... he throws it down in the car all the time, carry case was nice, since it keeps everything together in the closet haha"
2,Mixed review,"Our son, now one year old, has liked the leap pad since we got it several months ago. He pushes the buttons to hear the music and sound effects. However he also is fascinated by the slot where the sound card is inserted. He keeps pulling out the sound card which makes it hard to read the books to him. If Leap Frog designed this to secure the sound card then our son might not be distracted by pulling it out so much."
1,We like regular books better,"My daughter is 20 months old and has always loved books, so it seemed like the perfect Christmas gift. Unfortunately it hasn't been a good toy because she wants to turn the pages and it's pretty easy to take the book straight out of the Leap Pad. I keep hoping that may be she'll grow into it, but not so far. I'd suggest just getting some ""old fashioned"" children's books and go with those."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this when I found it packaged with the Lulu Letter Spinning Spider. Unfortunately, my daughter doesn't care for the system itself. She knows where the button is to turn it on and off so she does that a few times. Sometimes you have to pull around at the book to be able to press and get a sound to come which is a pain. You'd think it would have been made better to allow no flaws with touching the images on the book. I was actually disapointed with the product and bought a few books with it. My daughter is almost 2 so maybe later she'll take more interest in it. For now, she sticks with regular books.UPDATE: I deleted and am reposting my review with fewer stars. As we have had this since Christmas, it has stayed in a box since purchase. My daughter has no interest in this at all. I should have just bought the lulu spinning spider on its own."
1,not a happy mommy,"I bought this product for my son when he was nine months old. The box says ages 6-36 months, WRONG. What were they thinking making those paper pages. I don't know about anyone else but my son likes to tear pages and try to eat them. Isn't that why they make board books for infants. I was one of the unfortunate ones and like so many others trusted leap frog so I threw the box away. So we still have this worthless toy ( my son is now 15 months) I don't think we have touch it since. The only ok thing about this product is the activity cards."
3,too hard for my 2 year old,"I agree. I'm satisfied with the educational value of the toy. My only complaint is the ""little touch"" needs a ""big"" touch. My daughter gets very frustrated because it is too hard to get a response with her little fingers. My daughter is very independent and does not want my help to push the buttons. So, I'm calling the toy store today to check on a return."
3,No for children under 12 months,"My son got this toy at 8 months and he wont sit still long enough to read the books. He doesnt understand that if you touch it it makes noise. Unless your child is one who sits still, I would wait to get this until they are at least 1. And DONT LET THEM PLAY WITH IT THEMSELVES they will tear the pages, even when they are 2 years old."
2,difficult toy,"I was really excited about this learning toy. But I have been so frustrated that my son spends the entire time hitting the ON/OFF button. He loves books, but doesn't translate that love into using this toy. I think that the idea is good, but maybe the concept is just to far beyond this age group. There is nothing I can do with it beyond listening to the on/off music and voice over and over. Really, there is better value in a regular book that you go through with your toddler. If this product was to receive a better rating, then they need to put the on/off in the back where it can be disguised. I've been so put off that I don't know if I'd give any of their other products a try, or if I'd just waste my money again."
1,Not appropriate for 18 months to 24 months,"I wish I had seen these other reviews before I purchased this product. The pages are flimsy and my 22 month doesnt understand how he needs to push the ""go"" button on each page. Its very frustrating for him. Im going to look for a book that senses when the page is turned."
4,Little Touch Leap Pad,My two year old loves this item. It encourages her to want to read and have story time. I like this item but wish it had some storage compartment on it to hold more books and cartridges. I also wish the books were made with a more heavy duty paper but the stories are great.
2,no interest,My son has had this since he was 6 months old - now he is 17 months old and has never had any interest in it. He loves books but not this. Would rather just get $35 worth of books you can use for years and years.
2,Parents MUST play!,"This toy has the potential to be an excellent learning tool. The picture portrays a child playing/reading by herself, however, this just can't happen. It is too difficult for a child to determine which thing to push and the order to push things. It requires a great deal of patience... many times not a good option for a baby! The durability is less than desired. One minute with a baby alone and the pages are wrinkled or torn. I love to read with my son, but if you are looking for something to leave your child with, this is NOT it."
2,not for babies,"My 12 month old gets extremely excited when I bring this toy out for her, as she loves books and music, but SHE wants to turn the pages and the whole concept is just over her head. Maybe if the pages were more durable it would help but I think this is a toy that we will keep on the shelf for the most part until she is a bit older."
2,"Great idea, but hard to push for my daughter","When this 1st came out I was so excited, I purchased all 6 of the additional books sets and couldn't wait for my daughter to be old enough to play with it! Well, now that my daughter is old enough, I'm really disappointed. You have to press down really hard to get the areas you want to work. So hard I can't imagine a young toddler being able to do so. It frustrates my daughter so much that she now just grabs my hand and puts it to the picture she wants me to press down on. As all toddlers do, she loves to turn the book on and off. Not good for this since it looses all information on what level you are on and you must push the green go circle on every page, needless to say the only thing my daughter can do is turn the book on and off! The books are cute and have a lot of neat sounds and saying, it's just right now this just absolutely frustrates my daughter! We are much happier with Mattel's Learn Through Music."
3,"Touch Me, touch me I wanna feel your hand close to me.",The touching is very important to learn as a baby.Human touch is most important!Toys can also offer touching experiences!LeapPad wants to be touched1
2,Not as good as i thought it be.,I thought this item was cool cause it was for the youngsters. BUt my son is 16months old and all he wants to do is press that on/off botton and rip the pages out. So i would probably be for 3 and older. i wish i woudl of thought of that before i baught it. it was a good thought
2,too difficult to use for young toddlers,"My son got this as a Christmas gift at 18 mos. - a great concept, but waaay too difficult for that age. My 3 year old daughter enjoyed it more. The touch pad is slow to respond or nonresponsive unless you tap it just right. I know this is marketed as the beginning Leap Pad for the youngest of toddlers, but it's better to wait and get My First Leappad for 3 year olds and up, a much better toy."
2,Not age appropriate,"I bought this for my son when he was 6 mos. old. He had absolutely no interest in it. At 20 mos. he has some interest but only to turn the on/off switch to hear 'bye bye' or try and tear out the pages. It requires you to press hard on the characters to hear anything, which is not within his patience or strength level. I will put this away for another 6 mos. and try again!"
2,Not a good idea,I recenltly bought this for my niece for her birthday. As soon as we took out of the box I was ready to take it back. Her little fingers couldn't even press the thing. The only thing she plays with is the on/off button. I bought it because I thought it was a Leap Frog and their others toys are worth buying. But this one was a bad idea. I'm thinking of getting her the Fisher Price Baby Touch. It's more easier to use.
3,I'm trying Fisher Price,"Okay, so I don't own this one, but I checked out the differences and read alot of reviews. I am going to try Fisher Price Power Touch Baby with my 9 month old for Christmas. I got it and looked at it. The pages are thin, yet the buttons, etc. seem to press extremely easily. Hopefully, I will have better luck!"
2,not good for babies,As a Mom and reading teacher I bought this for my baby with high hopes of fun interactive reading time shared with my child. I was very upset when I actually used this toy with my child. The books are too long and flimsy and the toy is too hard to operate for a baby/young toddler. Do not even bother with this toy
4,great product,My son (20 months) loves this toy. The only problem is having to press the go button on every page. He hasn't gotten the hang of it yet so I still have to sit with him the whole time he uses it.
4,son was 18 months before he'd touch this.,"All he would do before 18 months would be try and rip apart the pages.NOW he is more gentle with books but he likes to flip and do things kinda fast and he cant (or us) keep up with him. Its a pain to have to tell it when he switched pages and we were always on the wrong page for the sounds.He does in fact love the single sheets that come with MOST (not all) of the books! He loves the one that comes with it.. he plays with the animal alphabet for hours!I think for his second birthday he'll be up to the next Leapfrog LeapPad. The books are kind of young for him and he likes the characters on the next one (Thomas, Dora, ...).It has held up though and he does love the parks that he loves!"
1,two boys neither likes it,"I have a 7 month old and a 22 month old so I thought they would both get some use out of it. This item needs a lot of work. The books are poorly made and the interactive parts are for parents, not children. Besides, there really are no good books to go along with the item (i.e. elmo, barney, thomas etc.). I would suggest putting your money into something else."
3,Worst handle design ever!,"The pages are flimsy for busy little hands. Our daughter crushes the pages, but I guess the description is tear-proof not crush-proof. Also my husband didn't see the little piece of paper in the instructions to put the handle in a certain way. He put it in backwards, and there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to remove the handle to put it in properly. The cartridges now have to be shoved in. I called Leapfrog for help, and the only thing I was told was to take the toy back to the place it was purchased to be exchanged. Unfortunately we got it as a gift without a receipt so now we're stuck with this annoyance. The handle alone drops my rating down by 1 star, but the selection and physical quality of books is pretty slim."
4,"My 20 month old loves to ""read"" with this","My little girl loves looking at the books with mommy. We read Guess How Much I Love You? every night. This is definitely meant to be an interactive toy (not just used in the backseat of a car), and is best used with a parent. The touch is a little hard to use, although she figured out how much pressure is needed after a few tries. The pages are indestructible (even through teething). The pillow on the back makes in comfortable to use. This toy is really a new idea, and helps make reading fun!"
2,Not age appropriate,"My 14 month old daughter cannot use this toy alone and even with my assistance doesn't hold her attention. My daughter is very bright and loves books & puzzles. We received this as a gift and I thought she might like it. She doesn't. The puzzle is okay but the books are terrible! The pages are EASY TO RIP, despite the manufacturer's claim that they are tear resistant. The absolute worst part has to be the books, in fact. The buttons are just pictures on each page and you have to press them for the machine to recognize that you are on that page. Trust me, your child isn't going to understand that concept for quite some time! My daughter loves to just flip the pages, and as such, the machine cannot keep up. The books are flimsy and the machine is too big.I do not recommend this TOY or as the manufacturer says ""educational tool."""
5,This is great!!,"I got this for my son Boyd, he is 13 months. I love it. It is so easy to use. He is still a little young for it. But he loves the noises it makes and likes to flip the pages. I think that I am more excited about it than he is. But as he learns to focus more, I believe that this will be a great teaching toy. I also like that it has books that say things in English and Spanish, so he can be a bilingual baby."
2,Okay,"Maybe my little girl is too little for this yet - she is 11 mos. However, it should have entered my mind that she couldn't do this on her own. It will only work to some degree when I do it with her. However, it is frustrating for me because she only wants to rip at the pages. Maybe it would be better if they made it of the thick book type pages (cardboard) and put the sensors inside. I wish i had bought something else - I just remembered that my nephew had loved leap stuff- and my daughter loves her lily doll, but I would pass on this one."
2,7 month old frustration,"I did not expect my 7 month old to sit alone on the floor and play with this leap pad. I did expect the system to respond to her touch, it does not. My 3 year old has a my first leap pad that she really loves and has enjoyed playing with this first touch but my 7 month old only wants to bang on it and chew on the book pages. We have also had trouble keeping the cards in place. We have switched back to reading board books in mommys lap. This First Touch Leap Pad is a good idea it just needs a little more tweaking. I think the learning drum by leapfrog would be a better item for 6-18 month olds."
2,Not worth the money,"We recently bought this for our 16 month old, and according to the package he should have no problem operating it. That is not the case however. He cannot push the screen hard enough to make it do anything, then gets frustrated and starts beating on it (which by the way still does nothing). We were very disappointed with this. We are taking it back today to get him the Fisher Price equivalent, at least that has Sesame Street cartridges he will enjoy."
4,Great for road trips,"I purchased this for a cross-country car trip with our 15 month old. She loves to push all of the ""buttons"" and hear the sounds go off. She instantly figured out the ""Go"" on each page and loves the sound it makes each time she presses it. We have 6 books and all have been interesting and different in focus. She hasn't had any problems with it being 'too hard' to press and the book pages stand up to her rough handling (they are a tyvek-material)."
2,Looked like fun but...,"We got this for my son when he was about 18 months. He is now about to turn 3. Over the last year I have pulled this toy out and tried to spark his interest in it, but it doesn't grab his attention. The only thing he wants to do with it is hit the buttons - isn't that what buttons are there for? I'd recommend a toy that is meant to be PLAYED with, particularly for boys who love to press buttons. :)Also, I found that even when I would try it myself, I'd get aggravated when the sounds didn't match up with what I touched. If you don't do the correct ""set up"" when you insert a new book then it gets all screwed up. By that time your little one has already moved on.We have Baby Tad and still like to play with him, and will probably get the real Leap Pad -- it's nothing against LeapFrog, I think their products are great. This one just doesn't happen to be very practical."
2,18 month old isnt impressed..,"My daughter recieved this for Christmas and since she loves books I thought it would be a big hit, but I was quickly disappointed. As many of the other posts the pages arent that sensitive and her little fingers dont seem to activate it so I always find myself tapping behind her to get it to work, thus she is not enthused for very long.The books are not well made at all, we paid $12.99 for each extra book and it consist basically of a plastic spiral binding and flimsy pages. They claim the pages are drool and tear resistant, but that claim is false. My daughter tore 2 pages just trying to turn them.In my opinion for the price of the books you are better off going to Barnes and Noble and buying interactive story books with the old fashioned push button and speaker system attached to the side."
2,Poorly designed,"Like the other reviewers mentioned, putting the on/off switch on the front is just asking for trouble. My 18-month old loved the Leap Pad, but only for this reason--turning the switch on and off. He didn't understand, since there were no visible buttons, that pressing the pages of the book activated the sounds. Even once he caught on, he got frustrated because he pushed as hard as he could, and nothing happened. You really have to apply pressure to get the books to work.Hopefully, they'll come out with a re-design of what I thought was a great idea...but I wouldn't recommend getting what's out there right now.Getting free interactive books online was a better bet!"
1,Not for us.,"We finally threw this toy out today. After 18 months it's broken and I feel like it was a waste of money. The screen was always very hard to press. My daughter was never interested in the narratives provided nor in following the ""script"". She did like turning the off/on button as a previous reviewer mentioned. As far as interactive toys my 3 year old daughter now prefers a real computer and as there are loads of appropriate pre-school programs out there I don't think we'll be buying anything from the LeapPad brand in future."
3,Reading a book is better,"My son got this at 6 months and is now past the recommended age for this toy and he never got into using this. He absolutely loves to read books with me. With this toy, I think there's too much audio stimulation going on that he has a tough time concentrating on my voice. His favorite part is pushing the on/off button to hear the ""bye bye"". Then we have to start over again. Not a favorite in our family."
2,Didn't realize pages would tear...,"I got this for my daughter when she was 18 months. I should have looked more closely before I bought it because I didn't realize the pages were paper. I just assumed they were laminated or plastic. She tore one page out within a couple days. She is now 2 and all the pages are all wrinkled up.I really really can't stand how long this thing takes to turn off. And being totally honest, comparing this to even her loudest toys, this one drives me the most nuts because it stays on forever. Ok, maybe 2 minutes, but seems like forever, especially when I have to come over and hold the off button myself, which has to be held down way longer than my daughter ever would.This toy is a good idea in theory, but I think they are just too young for it. It was way too expensive, and too fragile for this age group. I say just use board books until they are old enough for the more mature book readers."
1,unimpressed,"We bought this for my 1 year old daughter, she is now 2 1/2 and still doesn't like it. The pages are too flimsy for a toddler. It is not age appropriate. I wish I wouldn't have gone out and bought alot of books until we tried it out. We love leap frog products, but this doesn't hold her interest."
1,Great Idea - Poorly Made,"My 21 month old daughter received this as a gift. She enjoyed playing with it until we tried to put another book it in. The book that it comes with fits securely in the unit, but the other books we bought for it don't. At first I thought it was just the one we had, so I took it back to babies r us and had them try another one. 5 books later I decided to just return the unit as none of the books fit in mine or the new unit the store employee opened for me. I am very disappointed that there was no attention to detail put into the manufacturing of this product."
3,Hope its better later...,"I received this as a gift for my one-year-old son, thinking it would be a great way to get him to sit still so we could read together. It's not working out that way. He loves to pull the books out, and I think they come out way too easily. Even when he tries to press something, the book falls out too. I'm hoping when he gets a little older he'll be more interested in this toy. I think the concept is great, but am wondering if a one-year-old really doesn't have the attention span for something like this."
4,Each baby is different!,"I read many many poor reviews of this item. So many that I almost took this toy back after I had already purchased it. However, we have enjoyed learning this together. Granted, my 15 month old isn't much into the book yet, but he is learning the cards and gets SO excited when he pushes something (anything) and it rewards him with a tune. His attention span with the toy gets longer each time. He hasn't had any trouble pushing with his index finger.I think it is important to understand that this item was not designed for babies to play alone. It is a great interactive toy for parents/babies. He enjoys it just as much when mommy makes it play."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"My 10 month old son loves to sit and 'read' with me. He lets me finish reading a page before turning to the next, etc. So I was really excited about this purchase. But I should have spent the money on some additional board books instead.Benjamin pulls the book out of the holder when trying to turn the page and he just doesn't have the strength necessary to activate any of the sounds, which is frustrating to him. He is happiest when I just let him chew on the book. I'm hoping he will find it more interesting in a month or two."
1,not their best product,"We got this a gift for my 15 mth old son and I can't wait to return it. I agree with the other reviewa, the buttons in the front are very distracting for toddlers. As for the pages, my son has already crumpled one book so it won't work anymore, they need to be more durable. My 4 1/2 year old even had trouble remembering to press the ""GO"" button everytime!! this product needs alot of work.Save yourself some frustration and buy the Learn Trough Music product instead, it is much easier to use and extreamly durable!"
2,Hard Time pressing on answers,I got this for my daughter when she turned one. She has had a hard time with since. She wants to do it herself and can't. I have tried to help her myself and its hard for me to do myself at times. My nephew who's 4 had a better time playing with it. Pages rip easily.
2,Not for exploratory kids,"I bought the Little Touch when my daughter was 14 months. She immediately wanted to take the cartridge out. She spends more time taking that out, and the sheets off, rather than actually using it. I've tried using it with her and have tried to get her excited about the pictures and the sounds, but she is drawn to the real buttons (on/off and volume) rather than the pretend buttons on the sheets. Sometimes she even uses it to stand on. She's now 2 and has never enjoyed it. I'll put it away and will try it again when she's 3 and can understand what to do with it."
2,disappointed,"My one year old received this item as a birthday gift. She is now 15 months old and still has shown only slight interest. To encourage her I bought ""lets get busy Baby"" as "" Bears in the Bedroom"" was really not exciting her. She still only wants to turn the pages which I fear will tear very soon. In fairness however 'Lets get busy baby' has sparked more interest than the cartridge that came with the Little Touch. She has now learnt to press the on and off button but still not able to press the areas on the pages as they are too difficult for an infant. I will keep trying however."
3,Paper Pages!,"I really like the Little Touch LeapPad, and so does my 6 month old daughter. However, she gets excited and often wants to ""help"" Mommie turn the page. That would be fine if the pages weren't so flimsy. Perhaps cardboard or cloth would be better, ANYTHING BUT PAPER! The person who thought this up, didn't think it through. I want my daughter to enjoy our time with this activity and don't like that I have to limit her enjoyment by placing restrictions on her while we're using it. For now, I wil will only use the card inserts with the LeapPad and simply read the books at to her at storytime. Later, when she masters page turning, we can use the book with the pad and get the full benefit."
3,"Good pics, but too hard","I loved the idea of this toy, and thought it would be incredibly beneficial for my daughter (who's had it since 6 months). She is now a year old and still cant push the buttons, it just takes too much strength! I have tried pushing the buttons with her finger and I almost feel as though Im hurting her to try and show her how. She loves the boks and sounds, but it doesnt hold her attention as she is very independent and wants to do it herself.The books and pictures, however, are great. I would recommened the keypad have sensitive settings, (maybe 3 levels of sensitivy) so it would be VERY sensitive to the touch of a baby, and maybe require more strength as they grow and understand. Otherwise they lose all the cause &amp; effect learning from it!Overall, I dont regret the purchase, just feel it is not age-appropriate."
3,Highly disappointed,"We received this as a 1st birthday gift (along with many other cartridges) .... Not to sound harsh, but we hate it .. My daughter does not understand hidden buttons (therefore she sees the volume control and on/off button only). We are constantly having to start over because of this ... which is a pain.The need for touching go over and over again is a nuisance as well ... she doesn't want to do that ...I really wish someone would have talked to me before purchasing such an expensive gift for her ... or at least read the reviews. In theory, the toy seems great, but truly is a pain in the rear .... most children's attention spans don't want to continue pressing the Go button every time a page is turned.Thinking about selling it on EBay ... husband immediately threw the box away after opening )=If you are REALLY interested in having this toy, PLEASE go look at an in store display with your child BEFORE it is bought."
2,CHILD NEEDS TO BE ON STEROIDS TO USE!,"You have to push down so hard to get the book to react! My daughter is 2 and she can't push as hard as is needed (I have to push pretty hard myself). She pushes on the areas but gets frustrated because it doesn't respond and ends up walking away from it. I've even tried holding her finger and pushing down, but you still have to push so hard that I'm afraid I'm going to sprain the tip of her finger. Unless your child was born with super human strength, AVOID THIS TOY!!!"
3,dissapointed,"My daughter's father bought this for her for christmas, she was about 21 months old at the time and a very active child. As with many of the other children she had problems with this toy. I sat down with her several times and tried to help her, but she's a very independent and stubborn little girl who does NOT want help from anyone. When I'd try to help her she'd get mad and throw the toy. I didn't want it to break and didn't want to give it away so have put it away in storage. May pull it out again this next christmas and see if things go any better. For any of you out there who are interested in this I'd suggest looking for it on EBay or at a yard sale where it will be lots cheaper..then if your child doesn't like it there won't be a loss for money. It's a shame they don't have this one on display in stores to try out like they do all of the other leap frog products."
1,Not made for a 6 Month Old,"My seven month old son got this as a gift, but it is not age appropriate. This item may interest him in another year, but all he wants to do is pull the pages out for now. I do not agree with the age range Leap Frog is placing on it. For the cost of their products, they should do a better job of directing parents to toys that will actually be of interst at certain ages so that product loyalty will happen. I would never buy another Leap Frog item at this point."
1,what happened to just reading a plain book?,"what happened to just reading a plain book to your children? is that not enough these days? is that not enough interaction with your child? i must admit, my child was more interested in the box it came in than the actual product. i think technology is going too far concerning children and marketing and with over-stimulation. i was not surprised to learn that the pages for the books that go with the leap frog leap pad were coated with a special 'tear resistant substance'. what does that mean?"
1,bad buy,"My baby girl received this as a Christmas gift, she is now 8 months old. I put the cartridge in, the book in and was ready to go w/ baby girl in my lap.......the whole thing is in a basket on the landing of my steps and has been ever since...baby girl looked at me as if to say ""okay that was real fun!""very confusing and very misleading, doesnt do what it says it will do and works like a very very very slow computer. this only got 1 star since I had to chose one."
2,LittleTouch,"The product name is misleading -- you definitly need more than a ""LittleTouch"" to use this product. Don't they do product testing on actual children? My 1 yr. old (who is rather big for his age) did not have the strength to interact with the pictures, and lost interest almost immedietly. So unless you plan to sit there with your child to press everything for them, skip this product."
2,Too complicated for age recommended,"This toy is a great idea, but way to difficult to figure out for the recommended age. We bought this for my daughter's first birthday because the age was 1+ she's almost 2 now and still has hardly used it."
1,"Very dissappointed. Not a good learning toy, Hard to use.","This toy is abosolutly worthless. The only thing my daughter likes about this toy is turning the pages and the on off button. To get the thing to work properly you must push the green go button on every page. My daughter does not understand that, they are not easy to see and they are extremly hard to push. The things this toys teaches to me are not that important. I really wish ragit would focus more on the ABC's or numbers. The is a cartridge for colors but it is not very good. This toy could use a few bells and whistles. Music would be a nice touch too. She has learned nothing from this toy. I am very disappointed in this toy. I am going out today to buy the Fisher Price learn through music."
2,Not for my Tot!,"My son received this as a Christmas present, and it's pretty much done nothing but collected dust. He occasionally plays with the on/off button, and that's it. He doesn't care much for the book that came with it, or to learn how to work the device. He just walks away and looks through a Dr. Seuss book instead. This much money can be better spent on something else."
2,Complicated for Age Set,"Although I agree with some reviews that this is a toy meant for parent and child to play with together, even sitting next to my 2-year-old cannot stop him from hitting the on/off button throughout. On other toys, this is not an issue, but with this toy, it is a THREE step sequential process in order to return to the card or book we are using! Try telling a toddler he has to push ""on"" - then ""go"" - then ""lightbulb"" in order to get started. Or, that he has to push ""go"" EVERY time he turns the page; or that he has to hit ""adjust setting"" if he wants to hear sounds or narration. I've been working with him a lot, and do some of the steps so he can see, but inevitably he gets frustrated that he can't just play along and have things happen the way he expects. We are big Leapfrog fans in our household, but this toy was not really thought through."
2,Not for multiples or kids close in age,"I bought this for my twins when they were just 2 & it has been nothing but trouble. Like the rest have said, it's too difficult for them to use on their own until at least age three(then the stories/activities are too immature). Now if one child uses it, the others come & want to press the buttons. So frequently they aren't getting anything out of it since there is no cause & effect since three kids are pressing who know what at what time. Then often they somehow get on the wrong page & nothing makes sense. My take is: when I spend time with my kids. it will be reading them a book, not trying to fend off three sets of little hands all wanting to push buttons at the same time. My brother has this & has just one child age 2 & they love it..."
3,"Great item, just not for young ones","I loved the idea and got it for my daughter for x-mas, she was 9mos, she didn't really have any care for it. Now almost a year later all she wants to do is play with the on/off button. The buttons are hard to push and pages are flimsy. This is a great product for a 2- 3 yr.old. I did use this in my Kindergarten class. Great for older children. Teaches so many skills, just would have waited till she was older."
1,Don't bother!,"We received this toy as a gift...the book's pages are made of paper, so they wrinkle easily and ruin the book. It is too difficult for my toddler to use, he only enjoys the turning ""on/off"" and ""volume"" buttons. Replacement books are too expensive too."
3,"Nice Idea, but....","My 10 month old daughter cannot use this book. It's an adorable idea, and she's VERY interested in it whenever I read to her and use the special sound effects, but the paper pages can be easily ripped and the first thing she attempts to do once she gets near this book is rip all the pages out. Probably better for a much older baby."
4,Fun for baby,My son is 11 months old and he loves it when we play with his little touch leap pad however to get a response from the book you have to push harder than he can yet. But there are lots of great story books for it and the ltlp gives the stories a new dimension of sound and fun.
3,"Fun, but too hard for little fingers.","I thought this was a great idea for toddlers (especially toddlers like mine who doesn't like me to read to him, he prefers to look at books by himself), however, my little guy cannot push on the pictures hard enough to activate the talking, etc. So all he can do is turn it on and off and the volume up and down. I was disappointed."
2,Not worth the money,"My son received this as a gift and I was thrilled. My older son has the ""My 1st Leapad"" which has been an excellent learning tool. I just knew this would be the same. Wrong....it is not user friendly for little hands. All he wants to do is flip the pages (which are flimsy"" and has a hard time activating it by touch. I would save your money, wait a year and buy your child the ""My 1st Leapad."" It will be worth the wait!"
5,Leap frog does it again,"We purchased this for our 2 year old - at first I went through the steps with her on how to use it. Than we went on vacation and only brought it w/the addtional ""Let's get busy baby"" book. To my surprise she had learned that she had to press ""go"" and the lightblub on the activity pages and ""go"" on the books. Everytime she plays with it she comes across something new - ie if you press the ""animal Alphbet"" activity sheet letter twice it will give you the letter pronunciation! Our speech therapist thinks it is great also. This product has so many different levels that even the instructions do not detail it all. Now when we go places I do not have to bring a bunch of toys, only this with the addtional softwares and she will play for hours. She did learn the system faster with the ""Let's get busy baby"" book rather than the one that it comes with. Give this a chance - your kids will pick it up fast."
3,"Leappads are great, but this one is not the best.","I am a father of 8 children, and we swear by the leappad learning system. With that said, the ""Little Touch"" is a great device with some caveats. I bought this toy for my son when he was 1, he was definitely not able to sit and ""play"" it by himself until about 2.5I would have liked to have seen a better solution than the ""go"" button for turning pages, the ""age setting"" is in the book instead of on a parent-switch for this function.. My child happily changes the age setting as often as he presses anything else. It was a good idea, not having a stylus and it works fairly well.. Although my 9 month old smacks the pages and it doesn't actuate the touchpad.. It requires a ""poke"". The books are quite sturdy, they clip into the pad and are made of some kind of plastic material, very sturdy all in all. This is a great toy, and I'm glad I bought it, but it's not on the same page as the ""My first leappad"", ""Leappad"", ""Quantum Leappad"", or ""iQuest""."
3,wait until they're a little bit older for this one,"My 21 month-old daughter received this for a Christmas gift. I agree with several other reviewers-- it's really made for older kids. The concept of pressing the green go circle on each page is too hard for her to remember, and the on/off button is a great temptation. The paper (!) book is hard for her to use.That said, she does really enjoy the animal and musical cards that came with it. The one that names the letters and animals is great fun-- she's learned a lot of the animals already. I can ask her to find something, and she'll push the correct picture.I think I'll put the book away for a while and just stick with the cards until she's older."
2,Not very straightforward...to confusing.....,"I love leapfrog products, and so does my daughter. That being said this one needs work. It's not very intuitive and as everyone has already mentioned, the on/off button is within reach of little hands that think that is the main entertainment function! The pages are made of a material that is harder to tear, but can tear nonetheless.The functionality of it is a little confusing, and in my case, my pad had technical issues that made it even more frustrating!I returned the pad and the extra book I bought. Disappointing, but one product out of countless many that isn't a winner is alright with me! I am still a loyal Leapfrog customer! :)"
2,To Hard to Work,"I was so excited to buy this for my daughter, at the time 9 months. She could never push the buttons hard enough to work it on her own and she never seemed interested. She is now 22 months and still has a hard time pushing the buttons. The pages are very sturdy (she has put them to the test)! She loves books, but still does not show a real interest in these (I own all of them). If I could still return this, I would."
1,Didn't like it...,"I was always impressed by everything Leapfrog makes but this was not up to par. My 1 1/2 year old boy could not put enough pressure on the page to make anything happen. He grew quite frustrated. We returned it, got the next one up with the pen and now he's happy. Don't waste your time or money on the LittleTouch."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I read all the reviews, and despite the warnings of other parents, I purchased one. I'd alway heard great things about Leap Frog, so I disregarded the compaints. I was wrong. The volume and power buttons being on the front were a major distraction. My daughter continuously wanted to play with these buttons instead of the books. She still doesn't understand that she has to push the go button each time she turns a page. She gets very frustrated with this toy when I try to get her to play with it correctly. It is not worth the money."
2,What can I say,"I bought this for my son on his 1st b/day. Not only is he not interested in playing with this toy with me, but he is not interested in playing with this toy by himself either. He is more interested in pushing the on/off button and pulling the cartridge out than enjoying the sounds and sights."
1,leap start,"I bought this for my 9 month old for Christmas. She has yet to play with it. Every time I get it out for her she would rather tear it up than actually listen to it. I think that this would be a very good toy for 1 year and up, but not6 months and up. The leap frog system is a very good idea,my son got his for his third birthday and hasn't put it down, I just think that they need to put older age requirements on this toy."
2,wish I read the reviews first!,"I bought this a few months ago for my now 10 month old daughter. How is she ever going to be able to push the buttons, it's so difficult! The sound quality is not that great either. I thought maybe it was just me, but I see other have the same problem. It's to late for me to take it back. The box is long gone, and I didn't open it for about 3 months after I bought it.I'm really dissappointed, I thought with this being a leapfrog product it would be great, that's why I didn't read the reviews first, I was so excited when I saw it in the store that I just bought it. My daughter loves things that she can interact with, but she can't push the pad hard enough for anything to happen. Actually the only thing we use is the animal page and the xylaphone page and she tries climbing all over it and gets lucky when she's leaning on it to make something happen.I wish I would have read the reviews first."
2,Not for a toddler,"My 16 month old daughter received this as a Christmas present. My husband and I thought the toy was really neat. My daughter did not. She flips the pages so fast you can't keep up and the off button is too tempting. She keeps turning it off and adjusting the sound. At this point, she finds the toy to be a complete bore and would much prefer to have us read her a normal book than to follow along with the LeapPad."
1,Bad customer service,"My son received the Leap Frog Walker. The item came without leg support. I called customer service was told it would take 10 -15 days to get. Asked for supervisor. He said will be sent UPS ground most likely 4 - 5 days. I told him for severely developmentally delayed 12 month old and I need in my home for 3 days. Asked if he could ship priority, NOT over night, to get here. I was told he couldn't be responsible for an item bought from the store! The package was not tampered with, and when I told him that his attitude was rude / negative. I asked if he could help me, maybe he could send a donation to our town's new autism center. He said No - we already make other donations. This company does NOT promptly try to fix a problem. Even when I told him I would tell others of their poor customer service, which I am now doing."
2,Don't buy for a 1 year old,"We bought this for our 1 1/2 year old for Christmas along with a bunch of books and the carry case. What a waste of money. She likes my 4 year olds leappad because of the pencil. Thinking this was more for her age, I got this one. I wish I didn't She hasn't even looked at it for more than 2 minutes at a time."
4,Good for parents and babies to play together,"My 7 month old daughter just received this as a gift, and unlike some of the other reviewers, I think it's a great toy for her even though she can't play with it by herself yet. We sit with her on my lap and play with it together. I have to hit some of the buttons for her, but she enjoys hearing the music and sounds, playing with the pages, and banging on it which will activate some of the sounds. I'm sure as she grows older her pressing the pictures will become more deliberate. Even though she doesn't do the stories in order and still needs some help to play with this toy, she is still having fun and enjoying it, and that's what counts. This is a toy that will grow with her as she gets older.I've also found that pressing and holding for a few seconds activates the sounds more easily than tapping. If you tap you have to hit the pictures pretty hard and it would be hard for a little one to do, but if you just press it's much easier."
3,"Good concept, but needs some fine-tuning","The idea of this product is great. I liked that it would introduce my child to learning and reading in a fun way. Some of the booklets are great about introducing body parts, clothes, dancing, etc. However, it's difficult to operate, even for Mommy sometimes, so there is no way her little chubby fingers were going to activate it. We've had fun with it when I've operated the pages (which are great, because they don't tear!), but when I've encouraged her to play with it by herself, she loses interest pretty quickly. She would rather just sit and ""read"" a normal book to herself. Good concept, but if they want kids to really play with it, they need to make it easier for them."
3,Tricky to use...,"My 18 month old son got this as a gift from my inlaws and while I think it's a great concept, I think it can be a bit confusing for little ones. I was very excited to receive this and was all ready to rush out and buy more books but I think I'm gonna have to wait a little while. Maybe Leap Frog should consider changing the recommended ages -- 6 months is ridiculously low for this product. I'm thinking 18 or even 24 months on the lower end.My son loves being read to and loves to thumb through books and touch the pages and bable to himself about what he sees but he doesn't quite get that he needs to hit the GO 'button' to make the words match up with the appropriate page -- so the sounds are just there in the background and have no meaning with what he's looking at. When we do it with him he seems to enjoy it a little more but I think he's rather us just read a regular book to him.I *do* think he'll grow into this but in the mean time it's just a noisy, heavy book."
2,Little fingers can't push hard enough!,"I'm a big fan of Leapfrog toys, but this one was disappointing. Little fingers cannot push hard enough to activate the books. We didn't get much use out of it."
3,Difficult for little ones,"We bought this when my son was 6 months old, but it was very difficult to use with him until recently (now 15 months). You have to touch to go button on each page to activate that page. My son wanted to keep turning the pages and pushing the on/off button. Now that he's older we can sit together and explore the pages more. Leappad should change the age to 9 month and up (maybe even 12 months)."
3,Frustrating but good Product...,"I have to say that I couldn't wait to buy this for my daughter. I gave it to her for her first Christmas at 9 months. Luckily, I was smart enough to store it in the closet for awhile. She discovered its hiding place around 15 months and became instantly obsessed. However, I refuse to let her play with it because she can't sit still for me to go through the story with her and is constantly pressing the on/off just to hear it say bye, bye. A big complaint is that the pages are too flimsy and I refuse to let her ruin the storybooks. I finally put them all away and occasionally let her play with the more sturdy activity cards which are more suited for her age. Oh, we own almost all the stories but the one she really likes is Let's Get Busy Baby. The others require more of an attention span which she doesn't have yet. She and I both love this toy but I feel she will be ready to use it when she is a bit older. Not for a 6 month old!!"
1,Difficult for the kids and parents,"We were very excited about this product, but due to following things returned it.1. The touch does not work, you have to push the finger for it to work2. The ON-OFF button is in front and ""fun"" for the kids, so they tend to press that more often.3. To start on the next page the kid has to tap on ""Go"", not intutive for 15 month old.4. The paper book is easy to tear-off.May be we will wait for LeapFrog to fix some of these problems, or better wait for our son to grow and use ""My First LeapPad"" instead of this product."
1,Taking it Back,"We have a three year old son with special needs, and we asked my mom to buy this for his birthday. We are taking it back, however, because it is VERY hard to push and get a response. I thought it would be great because he would get a musical/verbal response from pushing on the right object, etc. But, instead I even got frustrated playing with it. I, too, love Leap Frog and can't believe they produced such a poorly made toy. I called Leap Frog, and they said to exchange it because it shouldn't be that hard to push, and there must be something wrong with ours. After reading the reviews, though, we are getting our money back because it sounds like everyone is having the same problem. Thanks!"
2,"Okay, but not great...","Like the rest of you, we were very excited to find that Leap Frog had come out with something for the under three age group. We got the Little Touch for our 2 year old and were anxious for her to try it. I played with it before she did and thought ""WOW this is great"". She plays with it and gets bored. She loves to turn the pages, but won't let me interact with her (she is very independant) long enough for me to hit the GO button and get the computer on the right page with her. (you must hit the go button on every page or it doesn't correspond). And then there is that pesky ON/OFF switch. Leap Frog is going to have to modify this! It never should have been put on the front where it is so easily found by a small child. Half the time this is all she does-turn it on and off and tell it bye bye.I really liked the thought of her learning with the Little Touch but will probably return it since she doesn't seem to be that interested in it."
1,"Little Touch Leap Pad, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways....","My husband bought this for our daughter, thinking it would be a fun, interactive toy for her to play with. Well, it's not. It's a great concept, but give it to a toddler to test drive. The directions are tough for a child to follow - certain keys have to be hit in certain sequences - and it really is nothing more than an exercise in frustration for her, and for anyone trying to show the child how to use it! I'd rather we spent the money on some good books or simple wooden toys, which encourage all the skills the Little Touch Leap Pad is designed to foster."
1,Not fun,I bought this toy for my daughters first birthday plus 2 more books and cartridges. I am at a loss trying to figure out how to get her to play with it and not crumple the pages. She will sit still longer to play with a board book than the LeapPad. I hope she grows into but I don't think six month olds to one year olds can really get any real use of this toy.
3,get 'em learning early!,"I got this for my 6 month old at the time. All he did was try to eat tyhe pages of the book. He's now 8 months and just started to let me read to him or use this interactively besides eating it.I have a 1 year old nephew who won't touch it.He has absolutely no interest in it.I know it say 6 - 36 months, but I don't think that's appropriate for anyone under 1."
3,Patience,"We received this book as a gift for my 1 year old daughter who was an avid board book 'reader'. She is 2.5 now and still it hasn't hit it's mark. She has trouble waiting for the opening music after pressing the ""GO"" which activates each page and then again after the ""lightbulb"" to start each activity. We have tried the narration part but again the opening music is too long. We use this to try to teach her ""patience"" and focus on each activity, but it turns out to be Mommy who eventually loses her patience. My daughter is compliant with listening to direction in preschool, ballet, and soccer - but it isn't preceded or followed by music.Suggestions - in level 2 or 3 remove music montage after each button.Love - the concepts, the teaching aspect, the interaction, durability of pages and discs."
1,Not Worth It,I was surprised how flimsy the pages were and easy to cease and fold. My son got it for his 1st birthday and by his 2nd birthday used it probably a total of 10 or less times. The books that go with it are on the expensive side for the quality.Wouldn't recommend this!
4,Fun for my 22 month old,"My 22 month old really enjoys this toy. She has no trouble pressing the sound buttons herself. Regarding some of the reviewers saying that their child focuses most on the on/off button, I think they've improved it. It's now small and white (not as obvious), and you have to press & hold to turn it off, so even if my daughter does play with it she doesn't turn the machine off. She doesn't understand that you have to press the green 'go' button on each new page, so I do have to supervise her to avoid frustration. The books seem okay to me - some have gotten a bit wrinkled, but still function properly. All in all, I definitely recommend. We've gotten many hours of entertainment from it, and I plan on adding more books to her current collection of three."
1,too hard to use for target market,"many other leap frog toys are great, this one is not. i recommend avoiding this one.as others have said, the ""on/off"" button is irresistible to little ones. my daughter just likes to press the power button and every time that happens the ""complexity setting"" gets reset to 1.way too much pressure is required to push on the objects for her to be able to do this herself. also, obviously a little one doesn't figure out the ""green go circle"" that needs to be pressed after every page change until they are way too old for the mind-numbingly simple stories that are designed for this product."
3,"Good Product. But, maybe not for babies....","This is a very cute product and a great idea. I was so glad that they came out with one for 6-36 Months. Our son was given the little touch leap pad as a Christmas present when he was 9 months old. The design of this product could be better. It is not a good design for the ages that they say it is designed for. A child this age can't push hard enough on the pad to make it work. My son is now 15 Months old and still can't push hard enough to make it work. Also, the ""On/Off"" button and the ""Volume"" button is right on the front at the top and is a major distraction to children this age. A child this age has a fascination with ""buttons"" and the only thing he wants to do right now is turn it off and on.All in all, I think this product is nice, it seems to work and everything. However, I would hold off buying it until the child is at least older than 16 or 17 months. I think my son may pay it more attention in a few more months."
1,"Great idea, bad design!","I was so excited when I saw this come out. My daughter is 16-months-old and loves books so I figured this would be perfect for her. Wrong! The On/Off switch is right on the front, so she kept turning it on and off. Once it turns off, the settings reset to the lowest level. We want to use it at the higher level, which asks questions about the pictures. So every time she turned it off, I had to go ahead and reprogram the thing! Plus, the books are made of very flimsy material.I ended up taking it back. What a shame! I'll keep watching for a redesign. I can't imagine the LeapFrog folks won't fix these very simple and very silly problems."
3,Good but could be better,I purchased the FP Powertouch book for my eldest's 3rd birthday and it is an excellent product. Easy to use and very durable. My youngest (16months) desperately wants to play with it but his brother won't allow it. I went looking for something similar but age appropriate. This is what I found. It is similar to the FP PT but not as simple to use. You insert a book and a cartridge and with your finger touch the pictures for sounds or story. Unfortunately with Leapfrog with every page turn you have to push a 'GO' button. Toddlers don't really get this or have the patience for it. They get confused when it doesn't work or says the wrong thing. At this point that is my only complaint. My child is happy to have something similar to his older brother and will learn to use it I'm sure. Oh the fabric on the lap pillow is really ugly. Now that is all.
4,All is well now...,"We bought this for my son when he was 19 mo. and he didn't show much interest in it despite older siblings with their Leap & Quantum pads, which they LOVE I might add. After playing the Little Touch pad for only two times it would no longer recognize the cartridge. So I just put the toy away. Now that my son is 2 I thought I'd pull the thing out to see what I could do. I called the Leap Pad Customer Service (number on their web site) and the rep was WONDERFUL! He walked me through cleaning the cartridge, which did not work. Leap pad sent me a new cartridge, which I received within one week. It WORKS! My son now LOVES it. Pictures are a little hard to press to get response, but he's figuring it out! So, for all previous complaints by other buyers, if you're having trouble, go to the source...call the company...they were great."
4,Not quite right for younger babies,"At the age of 6 months my husband and I sat our daughter down and took a shot at the Little Touch LeapPad. Unfortunately my daughter is not quite old enough to have the patience to play with the toy for more than five, maybe ten minutes. She gets very frustrated with this toy. Besides the age factor on this toy my only other disappointment is that the pages in the books were made of paper. I assumed they would have been made from cardstock. We did have a little more luck playing with the cards than the books. The only difficulty is that at this young of an age my daughter did not quite understand to push the pictures. When I could get her to push, she couldn't push the pad hard enough to make it work. I definitely this this toy would be much better suited for babies 18 months and up."
4,Daughter enjoys...if not as intended,"My parents bought this for my daughter last Christmas when she was 6 months old. She's now turning a year. She loves the books! They are impossible for her to tear, but thin like mom and dad's books and magazines. She'll play with them in or out of the leappad. We've only used the set on level 1 with or without narration and she seems to like the music well enough. The stories aren't very compelling, and she definitely has not figured out the pushable places on the pages, but alone she enjoys playing with the on/off and volume and turning the pages. Together she'll sit on my lap and turn the pages and I make it work for her. Overall, I can see all the drawbacks, but it seems super durable and she plays with it a lot!"
4,What a fun way to read and learn together!,"I had no hesitation buying this for our daughter, along with two additional story cartridges. Had we waited till she was two, she might have not attempted to rip the pages like she did at one year old, however, with patience and persistence, together we enjoy an activity or two every day and love the music, voices, interaction and educational concepts in this leap pad. Though an adult should be around to help with pressing ""GO"" on each page to start the activity, it isn't a big deal, as some other reviewers mentioned, and as for the difficulty of pressing the pages, I didn't find it too tough for little fingers at all. There are so many wonderful things to do with each session, you will find yourself turning to this toy regularly to teach shapes, colors, numbers, stories and songs. The comfy pillow pad allows you to sit the toy right on your lap for easy sharing with your tot. Once your child becomes accustomed to it, he or she will just LOVE this Leap Pad."
2,no battery shut off,"my 15 month old is too young to push the buttons in the book ... but he does love to push the on/off button.for some reason, in the 21st century ... they created a toy without an automatic battery shut-off. I'm not sure why they did this. My son turns it on and leaves it playing .. and it's usually hours before we find it in his play room. The batteries went dead the first time within a week .... the second time we didn't bother to replace them."
1,frustrating!,My child is 16 months old and the biggest problem I see with this device is that the on / off button is too fun! She would rather touch that buttion than anything else. I feel as if I have wasted my money but I will try it again in a few months. ( I feel Leap Frog could of made a switch on the side.) My advice...buy when your child is 6 months so they can have fun with your interactions...or wait til your child is 2.
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very impressed by the presentation of this item online so I bought this system for my daughter when she was around 6 months old. She is now 2 and I do not think that she has gotten much use out of the system other than to pull out the cartridges, turn it off and on and pull the books - that I now read independantly to her - and cards out - that I have to attach scotch tape to."
3,Warning:this could frustrate your child!,"I can't believe this is marketed for 6 months to 3 year olds!My daughter has had this since she was 2 and showed very little interest in it.I had to be with her the entire time we 'played' with it.I was trying to get it to work correctly(there is a procedure to follow to get each page to work right)and wandering little hands kept making their way to it,throwing off the whole sequence,forcing me to start AGAIN.It just went on and on,both of us running out of patience.Now she is 4 and is interested in it again.She is only slightly better at understanding how to do it herself.This toy was just an overall waste of money.Its easier to take out a book and read to your child or just sing songs together!"
2,boring,"Your money is better spent on regular books instead of this electronic gizmo. You have to press hard to get any of the pictures to make a noise so a child will have a hard time using this without an adult. I bought this for my 1yr old daughter, and my niece (3ys) and nephew (4yrs) also played with it. They all got bored easily. It was never something they took out to play with, it was done with my encouragement to try to get my money's worth. I ended up selling it at a garage sale."
2,"Great idea, poor design","My 17 month old son is very interested in this toy when he sees me playing with it, but he only wants to push the on/off button and volume because it's the only part of the toy that actually does anything when he pushes it. The touch pad doesn't work because he doesn't push it hard enough. As is, the toy is useless. If they would hide the on/off and volume buttons and make the touch pad more sensitive, then the toy would be something that my son would love."
3,"Fun for child at heart adult, but not for child","My Daughter is a very independent girl so she doesn't like getting help from other people. She wanted to play with her little touch leap pad but she didn't understand that she had to push the green go button on every page for it to work, so when it didnt' do what she wanted it to do she'd get upset and throw it. If anyone tried to help her she'd scream and throw a fit. I'm glad I wasn't the one who bought this for her, at least I didn't waste any money on it. I ended up having to put it away in the closet for a while, maybe I'll bring it out again after her second birthday, for now she's too young and stubborn to use this toy."
3,Pages are not durable for little ones Mother of 11 month old,I think this is a nice educational toy but my 11 month old just wants to pull at the pages and they are just not durable enough I guess at this age. Overall I would recommend this product but for a child slighly older than the manufacturers recommended age.
3,Too flimsy,I got this toy as a gift for my daughters 1st birthday. If the book is not in just right it wont work. Also my son who came 20 months after my daughter has since ripped all the books to shreads. Neither kid has any interest in this toy. I bought the regular leapster and my daughter loves it. My son who is 19 months even shows interest. I love leapfrog but this toy is not up to their usual standards.
1,horrible learning tool!,"I purchased this toy for my 22 month-old son for Christmas, and I cannot wait to return it to the store! I have to agree with the reviews preceeding mine about the on/off switch. It is a magnet for little hands - as is the volume button. Once you get passed that, then there's the ""go"" button that you have to push on each page so the story will match the illustrations. It took my husband and I a while to figure that out and we're smart people! It is not a toy designed for the age group it specifies (6-36 months). Perhaps on the older end of that range but overall, I found it very confusing and uninteresting to my son. Like others have said, read a book to your child instead. It's cheaper and much simpler. After searching all over for this gadget during the holidays and finally finding it, I am thoroughly disappointed! What a waste of money. This toy needs alot of work."
1,Read a book instead!,"I was very excited about this product for my 18-mt. old son and purchased the LeapPad and all the books that were available at the time. My son is now 2 1/2 and STILL doesn't really play with it. What an frustrating toy! The On/Off button on the front of the machine is a toddler-magnet and the attraction becomes one of turning it on and off, etc. You have to press hard to get the noises to activate and it's frustrating to have to press the ""GO"" button every time a page is turned. It confuses a kid when they turn the page and the sounds don't match the pictures.This is supposed to be an interactive product, designed to be used with parent and child together. However, this is NOT a necessary purchase. If you want an interactive activity, read a book and make noises. We as a society have convinced ourselves that electronic toys are educational. Seriously, your child will have more fun and you'll enjoy it more when you read a book TOGETHER. Save your money!"
1,I'm selling this in a garage sale...,"Perhaps those that have reported better experiences have a version that has been fixed, I bought ours over a year ago when they first came out and from the first time we used it, I hated it. It really was difficult for even me to get the thing to do anything with my finger. The tip of my finger would turn white! My now 2 year old still can't get it to work for her all the time when she pushes the pages. I think the pages are too thick or something. I'm planning on selling mine. I only have 3 books, but I'm not wasting anymore money on this toy. I'm moving on to the My First Leap Pad, my daughter will enjoy that one much more and I might as well have gotten that one when she was one since I'm the one doing all the work anyway."
4,on/off button on the front. WHY?!,"This is a great, educational toy if you have a perfectly behaved baby that never grabs things he/she shouldn't and never presses the wrong buttons. NOT! The main problem for us comes from the fact the on and off button and volume button are right on the front of the toy! Before we can continue with an actual activity, she has turned it off again! I let her push it to her heart's content thinking maybe she would get it out of her system, but she hasn't. The pages for the book are very thin, and although they are durable, they turn way too easily for a toddler, and then we are are on the wrong page for the activity! All in all, I'm really bummed we won't be keeping this. Maybe if she was older and had a little more motor control and the power button was on back it would work for us, but at that point I would have just bought the next pad in line!"
2,NOT GOOD FOR 6-9 MONTHS,"My son was more interested in ripping the papers than looking at the book. I babely let him touch it because the sheets are so thin. Even though it has that padding for your lap it was still pretty difficult to hold while I read to my son. THis book is for toddlers, not for infants."
3,It is OK.,"I got it for my 20 month old on Christmas. At first it was hard to push and activate it. But after my daughter played with it for awhile the pages were not as stiff. At first you had to really make the pages lay flat for it to work. Now my daughter can play with it herself. I read someone else's review that said they had remembering to hit the GO button, but my daughter has no problem remembering that. She would hit them because at first I would hit it everytime we turned that page. Now she knows to hit it. At first I was very upset with this, but a week later the pages were working fine. So it is OK, if you have patients."
4,Together Time,"I think this toy is great for little kids. They just need their parents to help them out. I think that's the whole reason they made it was so parents can interact with their kids instead of just leaving them alone with it. You can never start teaching your kids to early. The more they hear their colors and numbers when they are young the more they can remember it, talk sooner, and may even learn stuff quicker."
1,LeapFrog could've done better!,"I bought this for my 12 month old son. I was soooooo excited about this toy, and thought it would provide hours of mommy and me time. Boy was I wrong! The on/off button should be on the the back, that's all my son wants to do, turn it on and off, the pages are somewhat flimsy, and wrinkle easily. It is not suitable for a 12 month old, perhaps a 18 month old, 12 months is just too young to grasp the concept. I wish I would've thrown away the box, or that thing would be returned to the store! I would NOT recommend this product!"
4,Great early GU cd!!!,"This cd came out in 1998!! This cd is amazing considering it's age. Put these cds in your cd player today and it will still seem as new and clean as when it came out. The cds have a good mix of dark trance style that digweed is know for but also other songs that are not as dark. It's a good mix of both and flows great on cd one and two. Another good selection of GU is Digweed in Hong Kong, this cd is well put together and flows well."
2,a waste of money,this is the first GU cd i ever bought and i have to say that every one of digweed's other cd's are better. his vinyl selection on this compilation is incredibly repititious and downright annoying.
5,vintage,"If you are like me, then you like John Digweed for his seamless mixing and epicurean track selection. He also has a very distinct house-style to most of his music. I love cd1. Some of the reviewers here note the ""dated"" sound of this disc, and I would have to agree that it is no longer cutting edge or in line with the current vogue euro flavor, but it is dark, edgy, and very interesting. It sounds somewhat like Bedrock and Hong Kong. I love the housy side of Digweed and I think this is the area where he shines. Deep, groovy, and funky beats are more becoming of John Digweed than more common spacey trance music.Honestly, I could live without cd2. It could easily be any of a vast number of recent electronic trance music discs. That's just me though, and that sound obviously appeals to more people than cd1. This is exactly why I like being me."
2,"It's great to see some interest in Bruce Haack's work, but ...","The biographical information here is pretty sparse. There is practically no information here that someone who is aware of Bruce Haack would not already be aware of. The commentary from modern day musicians on Haack's work is pretty far from insightful too - they mostly go on like stoned retards about how ""messed up"" and ""trippy"" his kids stuff was. Despite this fact, the film completely omits the fact that Haack had a drug problem himself and that it contributed to the heart failure that caused his death. Perhaps this is because there was too much enthusiasm for drugs from everyone involved here to risk portraying them in a negative light. There is some great archival footage of Bruce Haack's television appearances here, but it is cut short. I would much rather have had a DVD of his complete television work, including the commercials he scored, rather than this fluffy mess."
1,Sound quality is poor.,"The man is great, his music great, this dvd is ok, sound quality is bad, buy a cd or some mp3."
1,Could not be played,"The children could not play the game because it was an X-Box game and we have the PSP2. I have written to the seller/to you guys regarding the game and that I need it changed to Play station 2, but uptill this moment we haven't gotten any reply untill now that you are requesting for a review. The game is there not played and useless for the children."
3,"Awesome in the beginning, kinda repititive in the end...........","I thought the controls were good, and it was great to flip around in the beginning! But after awhile, Nyc just got too big for me to know where mary janes house was and everything. The races got kinda easy. there is alot of chase scenes."
2,WAY TOO SHORT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm a huge spiderman fan, but I'm sorry to say this game was kind of dissapointing. The graphics are great, the story is interesting (although it kind of leaves everything hanging, not everyone is going to by the next issue of USM to find out what happens), the gameplay is good (too many chase scenes though)...BUT...THE GAME LASTED 5 HOURS!!!!....that means that each hour of gameplay costs you 10 freaking dollars....it's just not worth it."
3,Fun web-slinging accompanied by annoyances,"2 1/2 out of 4 starsPros: Web-slinging through New York is always entertaining; huge open-world with tons of side content and collectables; great comic book style cel-shaded visuals; good voice acting; can play as Venom.Cons: Boss fights are tests of endurance; Venom's missions are lackluster; no free-roam with Venom; awkward camera, especially during combat; obnoxious music."
3,I Don't Know,"I received these quickly , but had a mishap with the printer (that's gone now but, I still have the ink cartridges - many of them.) If anyone is interested I would like to get rid of them. If there is a way to do that can someone let me know."
1,They leak,"I am sorry to report that once again is worth paying for the original product other than getting an ink that leaks all over our printer and desk, hands, that is when it does not stop printing, both happened with on this product. I am taking as a lesson. This is the firs time in over 11 years that I purchased ""non original"" ink, and won't do it again."
3,Some good. Some bad,"First of all, you cannot beat the price. I paid only a few dollars including shipping. The first one worked well but ran out quicker than OEMs. Print qualitywas reasonable. The next one was similar. The last one was a problem. I put it in my printer and after a short time (few weeks) the printer said the ink was out. I checked the cartridge and it was empty. My Brother printer was kind of old so I decided to buy a new one instead of buying more ink cartridges. WHen I picked up the old printer to move it lots of ink started leaking out. I am not sure if the problem was my old Brother printer or the cartridge but I suspect the latter. For the money I can't complain but buyer beware."
3,Hoping I got a bad batch,"Not sure if I got a bad batch or not. The ink works fine, except for the fact that 2 minutes after I installed the ink cartridge the printer said I was out of ink. I pulled the cartridge out and sure enough it was bone dry. I didn't see any ink pooled up anywhere. I thought it strange and loaded the next one. This one went a whole day. The third one is only day 3. We'll see. The price is so great that I really want these two work. But honestly out of all the off-bran cartridges I've tried, none have worked well. I always find myself biting the bullet and buying the brand-name, and I may just do it again."
1,Boring!!!!,"This movie was a waste of my time. I was waiting for it to pick up but I gave up after 35 minutes. It was really boring about a girl who couldn't rely on her mother anymore for support. She had to get a job, try to sell the car she couldn't afford payments on, etc. Never really got to the romance part because it was taking too long."
4,Highlight of british folkrock,"This record is still a highlight after 30 years.I think,the best time Sandy Denny ever had with a first class band.Try to get the vinyl item.It sounds much more livelier then the CD-version."
1,this is NOT enigma!!!!!,"I agree with the reviewer from Portland below. I found this CD through a link from enigma, and, also being a HUGE enigma fan, am constantly looking for similar ""bands"". Pleasure Force comes no way near. I would like to re-state what he has already said. This is a cheap and tacky attempt at enigma - I just wish someone had written this before I bought it. The music itself would not be that bad if it were not attempting to be suductive. This lacks darkness and mystery, and the songs come across as cheesy and silly, complete with hilarious grunting noises and the ludicrous, childish repetiton of words like ""sex"" and ""feel it"", etc. This is definately not the soothing, sensual and lustful creation which it is attempting to be. If you want that, buy any of the three enigma albums. Not this."
1,Weak attempt at Enigma,"Being an Enigma fan I am always looking for an artist with like sounds. I always wondered why no other performers tried to emulate this sound. When searching through Amazon I stumbled upon the ""If you like ....."" area. I took a chance and ordered Pleasure Force. A big mistake on my part. I concider this purchase to be one of the worst CD's in my entire collection. I wrote this review with the intent to save others the same fate. My free advice to you would be if you want Enigma, buy Enigma. There is no substitute. Sorry PF fans. This band tries so hard to compare with Enigma and they come up way short.........."
4,Even Velveta has it's merits!,"...First off it's a fable and as with any fable it's stripped down to essential and easily memorable elements. ... The basic premise in the book is that change is inevitable and when change comes along it's more effective to accept it and choose a course of action rather than to sit around being bitter feeling victimized, or to be in denial that a change has to occur. This simple little book can be a like a light at the end of a tunnel if you are really stuck and need simple advice to help you find a way to adapt to change."
1,Fascinating ... that readers are fascinated,"You need only waste about 15 minutes of your time determining that this ? book ? is absolutely worthless with regard to the supposed subject matter (change in business or ... whatever, I really couldn't find any subject matter). What facinates me most about these and others like it is that they sell, ... and sell a lot... and unlike this books' subject matter ... THAT is truly fascinating. (...) These books exploit and reinforce the short attention span/quick fix mentallity of those who read them while all the time purporting to arm their readers with the very principles they are destroying.In very simple analagy, it is like telling us that only hard work pays big dividends, and then asking for big dividends for having told us that hard work pays big dividends. If we hand over the money, we invalidate the very principle for which we are handing over the money. The joke really is on us."
5,Encourage people to take control of their own lives,"This book is a simple way of helping people understand that change is going to happen, and it's up to them to decide how they will handle it. It doesn't necessarily give practical advice on how to handle any real world situations, it simply explains that we all have choices, no matter how out of control we may feel. Reading this in a group can help facilitate discussion about change in general, and communication is the key in the workplace when dealing with uncertanties. As the previous reviewer said, it's for the heart, but I do think it's also for the mind...for the attitude, and we all have control over our attitudes."
1,Not Hungry for This Cheese,"This book was given to me as a gift. It costs 12 dollars to buy and it takes 20 minutes to read. Believe me, your money is better spent elsewhere.Mr. Johnson basically trys to take a story about mice and relate their existence to ours. We may be able to use mice to test medicine and vaccines, but they should not be used as a basis for how to live our lives. As humans, we are FAR more complicated than a couple of mice in a maze.If you are looking for a ""Self-improvement"" book, I think your money would be better spent on Stephen Covey's ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People."""
1,Scurry needs a monitor.,"I am immediately put off when someone says, ""If you don't like it you just don't get it."" No, I don't like it because there isn't anything to ""get"", except, like many managers, scurry needed a monitor."
3,Lighten up gang!,"If you are expecting a life changing experience, keep moving. This book is simply a nice 45 minute thought provoking experience. I think it is helpful to those with marriages and relationships more than anything else. How many people stay in a relationship because they lack the courage to search for ""new cheese"". Complacency can be the worst thing in a marriage and this book addresses that pitfall. I also see this as helpful to those who are ""downsized"" from a job after many years only to find a new job or career more satisfying than they could have imagined. I have clients who have found the best thing that ever happened to their career was having their ""cheese"" taken away."
4,A quick and easy read!,"This is a quick and easy read! Written in a similar style to the wonderful 'Serendipity's Secret', the learning points are woven around a charming but simple story. A very inspiring read with useful practical steps to improve your life in many ways, not just coping with change."
1,Corporate Baloney,"If the author truly wanted to help people in the workplace, he/she would have written a book about effectively managing change, with quitting your current workplace a last resort. This book should be titled, ""We Can't Fire You, So Why Don't You Just Quit."" This is indeed a book that assists corporations in shoving excess personnel off the cliff so they are no longer their problem. To be an effective employee you have to be an obedient non-thinking mouse? Sheesh."
1,"1 star, but only because the pages were numbered correctly",It's been said that you could put a hundred monkeys in a room with typewriters and they would eventually come up with a literary effort to rival Shakespeare. My guess is that it would only take one monkey about ten minutes -- with a five minute banana break built in -- to surpass this slice of individually-wrapped nonsense.
2,doesn't move cheese for me,"It's a good little story, but it's too black and white. No grey area in the land of the mice/cheese maze.I think there are better books to read out there on how to handle life. Keep this for a quick read if you need to find something to read (ie: bathroom), but don't read this and expect your whole view on life to change.The drawings of Hee and Haw are cute though."
2,"""Two stars because it has a positive message""","For children, or an adult who has lived in a cave his whole life this book is a great primer. The concept is phenomenol, accept change and move on. I found ""Oh The Places You'll Go"" by Dr. Seuss to be a much more fulfilling book. Again, if you are trying to motivate a child--or possibly a teen, this is a great book, but as an adult, I only found this book mildly entertaining. I'm sure the author took his cheese and laughed his way all the way to the bank."
2,Too simple minded,This is another one of those management buzz things. It spend too much time stating the obvious and never addresses why the cheese needs to be moved at all. Don't expect any great revelations here.
3,Cheesy Story,"An entertaining and simple story to help you deal with change. Though somewhat simplistic, the story holds much wisdom. It is a quick read. It is worth the short time it takes to go through the book."
1,WHO MOVED....MY WHAT?,"You could read this book in the time it takes you to eat your lunch, and still have time left over for that second cup of coffee. Simplistic, you say? That would be an understatement. This is more like a Grimm's fairytale for grown ups. Then we run across Sniff and Scurry, Hem and Haw? Now what does that tell you about the book? The only characters missing are ""the cat and the fiddle"" and ""the cow who jumped over the moon.""If this book (all 94 pages of it) has, indeed, helped save marriages, businesses, health and careers, we are destined to put a lot of marriage counsellors, business consultants and health care practitioners right out of business! How is that for adjusting to change?"
5,A great book for Life Success,"Who moved my cheese is a GREAT book. It should be required reading for anyone living and working in the twenty-first century. It's a fable with a valuable message, like the stories we grew up with as kids. It is simple to understand, short and easy to read and it drives the point home. I recommend it highly to all my audiences when speaking on the topic of making lifestyle changes. I also suggest that if you embrace and want to make changes in your life, ""Who Moved my Cheese"" is the precursor to reading ""Jump Start Your Life"" a book outlining a process by which to change your lifestyle. I thank Spencer Johnson and Ken Blanchard for this wonderful gem."
2,Good book for children.,"Who Moved the Cheese? was a disappoint, too simplistic and too expensive. The book's insert card (listing 7 points) said it all. I saved the card and passed the book along. There are many changes that one cannot savor."
4,Simple Writing....Deep Message,"I thought this book was quite good. I enjoyed the story itself and could see my self rather clearly in one of the characters. I thought the introduction was a bit long. I think the reason the the book is so widely appreciated is because the author knew that you have every spectrum of employee in your average company, from those with a Ph.D. all the way to those who did not graduate High School. In order to speak to a wide audience, you must put it into terms for everyone's consumption. This book may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think that change is a regular ingredient in our lives that we must come to grips with. How we react to change (which will always be occurring) can set the tone for our very temperament. Kudos to Dr. Johnson!"
2,Who (re)moved the content?,"If you like slogans, you'll like this book.Enough said. By the time you read this you could already be on, oh, about the 33rd page by now."
3,Too Medium,"This book was truthful and a helpful reminder; however, a timeless parable should impart wisdom most of all unto the previously wise. `Who Moved My Cheese?' either attempts to target the `employee' or hopes to resurrect the hapless employer. By definition a parable is a simple construct, yet a timeless parable constructs its power upon a seemingly endless depth of meaning and continual output of inspiration. ""Who Moved My Cheese?,"" is a one time read and therefore achieves good coffee table adornment rather than majestic bookshelf, multi-generational longevity..."
4,I think that the people who.....,"..... have gone out of their way to trash this book are among those who simply ""do not get it"" and frankly...never will. The point of the book is to get a person thinking and perhaps bring us back to the basics in life that are so often overlooked. Thinking this book is going to change your life is absurd and totally unrealistic. Put things in perspective and think a little!"
1,It's a dumb book,It's a dumb book whose only purpose is to serve micro-managers in the workplace. I know because my micro-manager boss loved the book and I knew all he wanted was for me to say how wonderful it was. He also had a bumper sticker that said something to the effect that if you aren't the lead dog the scenery never changes. The man changed his mind with the wind and he thought this book gave him justification where there wasn't any.
2,"Message is fine, book is silly.","This lesson this book attempts to teach is that we shouldn't be afraid of change and of taking chances. That's fine, but the book is so simplistic and repetitive and silly. And it hits you over the head with its story. This may be a good book for 3rd graders, but at this point in my life I don't need to learn life's lessons from little mice with silly names."
1,Life isn't a piece of cheese.,This book is an overly simplistic way to look at changes in ones's life. Some changes occur suddenly without warning! I found the book to be discouraging. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that was involved in unwanted changes in their lives.
3,Not for leaders !,"This book is for the kind of people who might need a push in order to change. If you're one of these, this book will definetely help you, is very imaginative and easy to understand and read. However, if you consider yorself a leader, it won't be of much help; since you might find the story rather silly and the examples given by the author a little too superficial and with no real ""cheese."""
2,Don't look for much insight,"Change happens. Change is accelerating. Deal with it.It doesn't get any deeper than that. No doubt ""Cheese"" has become a bestseller as a propaganda tool, (training aid?), for stimulating and executing change. Anyone so out of touch that they've missed the increasing depth and pace of change probably needs this kick in the pants. Anyone looking for insight and guidance out of this odd parable will have to look elsewhere."
2,Common sense for the masses,"This book focuses on the simple notion of embracing and expecting changes in our lifes or risk unhappiness. The analogy used to convey the book's message, albeit effective, was a little childish. I also didn't really appreciate the book's closing sales pitch, asking the reader to share the book/message with others. On the otherhand, this quick-read stated it's good-natured purpose in an organized and easy-to-remember."
1,It's all about power,"When you write a book on why those WITHOUT power should be accepting of any treatment by those WITH power, you're guaranteed to sell millions of copies of said book to those WITH power. It's little wonder that managers, CEOs, teachers, and pretty much anyone with authority over others praises this book. It gives them a moral blank cheque, and condemns anyone NOT in a position of power for even questioning, to say nothing of failing to conform.If you want a crash course in what's wrong with humanity, read this book. The fact that there are people in this world who read and agree with it is horrific."
1,ok story stretched (thin) into a book,"What was probably a decent (if somewhat cutesy) analogous tale about not only embracing change, but creating it -- was stretched and pulled to its breaking point. This is a tale that does not warrant being bound into a book -- a pamphlet, maybe, but not a book.Not only is the type HUGE, but there is a sidebar-type note written on a block of cheese on practically every other page. The contents of this cheese-wedge are trite at best, insulting to the intelligence at worst.This is a story that should be told, not sold, especially not if selling it involves adding 20 extra pages of fluff."
1,"""Father Knows Best"" for business","This book is tained for me because when I first read it I worked for a company who did not value their employees. There was a lot of restructuring going onand the ""grunts"" were nervous and anticipated things getting worse and worse. Suddenly this magical book appeared, everyone was forced to read it & later watch the movie. Changes did happen and people continued to be unhappy. I no longer work there.This book is management PROPAGANDA. ""Father knows best"" for business."
1,Oh please.....,"The idea that change is inescapable is nothing new. Just ask the Buddha....... What is insulting is to have it suggested that I just accept change at face value, without looking to see if the change has any merit in the first place. Change for change's sake is a waste of time, resources, and stress that could otherwise be used more effectively elsewhere. And to have managers try to use this as a way to manipulate their workers is a shame--the idea being, ""Accept this change without question, or risk being seen as not being a 'team player'"". Or worse, ""You're not thinking outside of the box, using a new paradigm"" (God, that is so cliche and simplistic.) It gets old hearing, ""Change is good......change is our friend......do not question....."" George Orwell was right. Save your money, friends."
2,Good book for the hopelessly lost,"If you're big headed like me and think you have most things figured out you're going to find that this book is simply too simple to be beneficial. Nothing new and nothing really beneficial in this book unless you're hopelessly lost in which case, don't bother reading it, you're hopeless."
1,Save your money,"Instead, borrow the book from one of the thousands (millions?) who were either gullible or dutiful enough to buy it, spend 20-30 minutes reading it, then take the money you would have spent on the book and buy the parody, ""Who Cut the Cheese?"", by Stilton Jarlsberg. A backdrop against which to enjoy the parody is the only good reason to read this book, unless you NEED to have the obvious pointed out to you in a mixture of inane platitudes and 5th grade English."
1,Not so amazing,"Under certain circumstances, this book is helpfull, such as in personal relationships, tragedy, disaster, etc, but this books advice can be summed up pretty well in one sentence:Get over it, and get on with your life.But, in the context of someone making profit or gaining power by change, this book is dangerous. Unquestioning acceptence of change encourages unethical behavior on the part of those who orchestrate change. It could even be argued that it is unethical to encourage blind acceptace of such changes. One only needs to look at history or read the news to see this pattern emerge. Enron comes to mind. So do most political dictatorships."
1,Infantile drivel for the weak-minded,"This book is so lame, tedious and insulting that if your employer forces you to read it - I would strongly suggest you go in search of better cheese. I don't know what sort of person is so naive as to need the 'advice' and 'lessons' that this book supposedly teaches, but I weep for us all if there are people who can genuinely learn something from this garbage.The writing style, storyline and basic analogy are fit only for ten year olds. It might be a good read for a rotten child who is having trouble coming to terms with the basic unfairness of life, but no semi-intelligent adult should be subjected to it.The fact that this book has enjoyed so much success is a sad sign of the dismal condition of our society."
2,Ultra-Simplistic Basics at a High Price,"This book can easily be read in 20 minutes while say, browsing in your favorite bookstore. Then you can save your money to buy a real book. The ""story"" is crude, uninteresting and poorly told. It's written to illustrate the points the author wants to make about embracing change. It's hard to believe that people will shell out alot of money to read what should be a chapter in a book or could stand alone as a magazine article. Overall, it did serve as a very quick and very very basic reminder about anticipating change in life, but don't waste your money buying it, just read it in a bookstore and buy something else you want."
4,"No Change, No Gain","From Department of Marketing, City University of Hong Kong.Now the world is changing but many people don't like to make any change. This book tells a story about the result of changing and NOT changing.The story is not difficult. Only four characters with their own personalities appear. It shows the tradegy of one character who insisted on staying instead of changing. If you don't make any change, you can't get anything you want (cheese). On the other hand, another character knew that he should make a change or otherwise he would get nothing with him.This story will make you think more about how to adapt to change and what the result is for not changing."
5,A Great Reading Experience!!,Reading this book was a wonderful experience. Change has been pictured in a very interesting way. It is the book for people who know change is for the better but they are reluctant to change.A must read for everyone...
2,Light and fluffy,"Not quite as deep and meaningful as a lot of people would lead you to believe it is. If you're down with not getting yourself into a rut and dealing with change then the underlying message in this book will leave you thinking,""that's it""?I'm sure the message would be eye opening for some, but it's tough to believe that it will help people who have been working for more then a couple of years in the corporate world."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzz -- Great cure for insomniacs,"Dull with a capital D. Five minutes of plot squeezed into just thirty minutes of reading. What was originally used as a 5-minute icebreaker on the speaker circuit has now been stretched to the breaking point.What was he thinking? This book is an oxymoron. If you are among the audience for which this book is intended, then you can't possibly like it. On the other hand, if you like to watch those bonehead movies made from SNL skit plots, you'll probably love this, too.I wish I had waited for the abridged edition. It will be two paragraphs, max. (Really!) BTW, I highly recommend the One Minute Manager, but this one is a complete waste of time."
1,A book worth burning,"I don't wan't to get into a bitter arrugment about how much I hated this book--I think the previous bad reviews sum up my feeling quite accurately. I would like, however, to suggest to those managers and corporate elite that are giving out pink slips and such to replace the cheese book with Dr. Suess's ""The Places You'll Go"" book. It may be considered a kids book, but the message within is much more inspiring than the cheese book. If I were to receive Dr. Suess's book with marching orders, I'd probably kiss the boss, and march off to great new places ""where boom bands are playing."" If I were to be given the cheese book, I'd probaby huddle down in my cubicle and wish for a quick and timely death. You (employer) may not think the cheese book so bad, but consider this, a lot of people do. If you give this book out in hopes to boost moral, you're playing with dynamite."
1,This literary classic smells of Gorgonzola,"My boss forced me and others to read this marvel of literature to pave the way for a new 'exciting' (why are management techniques always veiled in excitement?) policy at a luxury menswear store. It reflects his intelligence and character. I am not exagerating when I claim that this book embarasses its author and insults the reader with the most banal statements since Cathy Lee. The reason the cheese was moved is because it started to smell! Who cut the Cheese is what I asked when I finished this masterpiece. If you're thinking of having your employees read it, it's guaranteed to make them hate you and ridicule you. The subject of change requires thoughtful insight not childish tripe."
1,More Corporate Mind Control Propaganda,"This is a best seller? I suppose it gained that status because large corporations put in orders for thousands of copies and gave them to their employees, or required that employees buy the book. Sniff and Scurry represent the mindless blue-collar laborers who, when their jobs are eliminated and sent to a third-world country where labor is cheap, have no choice but to sniff out new employment if they can, no questions asked. Hem and Haw represent the more ""mindful"" middle management corps who are supposed to swallow anything the all-powerful cheese movers tell them. I was insulted by this book and I hope that workers see through its propaganda. Not all change is needful and good, especially when it is imposed upon us for the self-serving purposes of mindless and heartless corporations. Wake up! And refuse to eat this moldy cheese."
2,Might be useful for introducing change to kids...,"My family has always loved Spencer Johnson's value tales, and I approached this book with great expectations. But I found it trite, pretentious, repetitious, and not as well-written as some of his other books. It was also agonizingly commercial - sprinkled throughout the book are touts to buy thousands of copies for your business so that everyone can hear the profound message that you shouldn't be afraid, change is good for you!It is written at about the seventh grade level, and as I read it, I thought it might be useful for introducing the ""facts of change"" to youngsters."
1,"""Who Cut the Cheese?"" because this one stinks!",Some sharp marketing kid fresh out of college gets 5 stars for figuring out how to sucker businesses into buying this piece of trash in bulk. My company held a contest to get us to read this pathetic excuse for a management/self-help book. Halfway through the book I fell asleep because Dr. Johnson managed to write in monotone and drag out what should have been a more effective story. The big print and big margins should have been a big clue that this book was a big waste of money.
2,"eh, kinda basic","This book is basically a parable that can be read in about 20 minutes at the local bookstore cafe. Yes, the moral of the story is important, but you don't really learn anything new. I found it to be incredibly overhyped."
5,Who Moved My Cheese,"This book does an excellent job of explaining in very elementary terms (with a sophisticated message) how to deal with change that can be applied in many aspects of life ... personal, professional, spiritual, etc. It is a quick read ... about 1 to 1 1/2 hour.The book also arrived very expeditiously from the seller and was in excellent condition.Overall, I was extremely satisfied with the content of the material in book and the seller."
3,Brilliant marketing of timeless tips and well-worn adages,"Hello,This book is an historical gem. For those who remembered the last revolution in Business and Marketing this book will come as quite a surprise, because it repeats many things that we once thought correct, but in a style that is way more convincing and compelling.Moreover I liked the title, which is much more down-to earth than some of the more prosaic and ego-centric titles of the past.Well, its worth a read, even if it is to have something in common with the rest of the aspiring executive golfers and water fountain philosophers.Good reading!Regards,Martyn R Jones"
2,Cute and Valuable --- but Potentially Dangerous,"I never intended to even pick this book up. The title didn't particularly interest me. But it turned out to be an appealing little story, and a useful little handbook for dealing with change management at all levels and in all aspects of life. Normally, I deem books like this condescending, but the story here is so typical and essential, I thought that it could actually be effective --- especially for those in upper management, whose comprehension levels are usually somewhat limited. My fear, though, is that the book might do no more than serve as a downsizing handbook for upper management. Nonetheless, there is value to be gained from the story --- value that can help one deal with any kind of change, be it job-related or in one's personal life."
4,"simple yes, effective yes","Yes, this book is simple and short (I read it in less than one hour). Does that mean it's not effective? NO. As I was reading this book the quote ""what would you be doing if you were not afraid"" hit me like a ton of bricks. Think about it, how would you be living and loving if you were fearless? Probably not the way you are living now, right? My only complaint about the book is that it somewhat indicated that workers in the work force need to be more flexible. True, but my experience with corporate America has always been that upper management in America needs to be more flexible and not so content to say ""but, we've always done it this way"" when asked why are we doing something that doesn't make sense or is not cost effective. The book is worth reading whether you are having problems keeping up with the changes in your workplace or home. It would make a great gift for anyone."
5,Soon to be a pamphlet?,"An inspiring parable. However, I must agree with some of the other reviewers who pointed out the high price. Until they release a paperback version for less money, I would recommend borrowing the book instead. I disagree with the reviewers who felt the story was ""corporate propaganda"". One of the points made in the story, is that when the cheese begins to look moldy, be prepared to abandon it for better cheese. I took this to mean you should consider heading down the maze to look for a better ""cheese station"". The parable teaches that you must see yourself in control of your situation, blaming others only gives you an excuse to remain lazy."
4,Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes,"I found this book to be quite interesting, although a bit simplistic at times (it's fairly short). Although not the usual fare of ""change management,"" it does a good job of introducing the notion of Change....both in your personal life and professional life. If it could have provided some real life examples or anecdotes, I think I would have enjoyed it more; instead, it's a we-are-a-rat-in-a-maze type of allegory that, while entertaining, is not worth 5 stars."
3,A good reminder lesson on change management,Its a quick read and great for reminding us all that change is to be embraced not resisted. Buy this book and put it on your shelf for that day that you're experiencing a particularly challenging change in your life. It'll help you keep perspective.
3,"Nice Anecdote, but rather too simplified.","The writers are using a nice analogy as of how to deal with changes in our life, the two mice representing a simple mind that can foresee (smell in this case) changes by instinct, while the two small men are representing the more complicated mind that must over analyse each problem. Though I still think this analogy is over simplified, real-life problems are much bigger than this."
4,So much hype on this . . . good and bad,"After hearing how awful and how wonderful this book is I decided to read it for myself. It has something to say (at a very basic level) but I can understand why anyone wanting more substance than a parable can provide would be less than impressed. But what do you expect from a few thin pages? In fact the book is blown up to appear to have more content than it actually does. For more substance, I'd suggest ""Filling the Glass"" or ""Shakelton's Way"" or even Stephen Covey's ""Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."""
2,The advice is good but...,The childish writing style gets old very quickly. If you're smart you can learn from a lot of different sources. I don't want to say there is nothing to be learned here. It's just that you can see the destination of this book long before you get there. And it's not a long book.
1,Cheese Whiz,"""Who Moved My Cheese?"" is a follow-up story, a part two if you will, to the author's first inspirational novel ""Who Cut the Cheese?"" Both stories stink just the same."
1,Who cares where your cheese is!,How this is such a bestseller is beyond me. I was certainly not inspired by it in any way. I kept reading hoping to find the reason it has affected so many people - my daughter even had to read it as a requirement in a college course. After reading it I felt like I had been lectured in a very demeaning manner. Not on my best-seller list!
4,A little reminder can't hurt...,"I agree with those who have given this book a poor review, in that, there really is nothing in it that you don't already know. However, I disagree that it is a waste of time to read. It is very easy in today's busy world to forget what you already know -- and that is that change happens. Yes, change happens every day and we are constantly dealing with it. However, sometimes it is easy to get stuck in a rut and resist change. If being conscious of a problem is half the battle, then how can this book be all bad? It definitely raises your awareness of how change affects all of us and provides simple ways to deal with it. I won't say it's the best book I've ever read, but it's definitely worth the 30 minutes it will take you to read it."
2,"Are you sniffy, scurry, hem or haw?","Actually, none of the above, but I'm afraid that after people read this they will want to name me as one. While the message is simple and important (be ready and able to change), we all cannot be measured so narrowly. We have all been given the gifts of various emotions (including fear), spirituality and rationality to use in our decision making process. It defies logic that we would ""strip"" ourselves of these gifts and make such simplistic conclusions.What I fear even more is someone concluding that I must be a ""hem"" or a ""haw"" if I don't find this book as inspirational and motivational as the author said I would."
2,Disapointment,"I was disappointed with this product. The ""kit"" consists of the book and a CD. I was familar with the book, so that was no surprise. But I expected some type of video or annimation on the CD. Instead, it was mainly just a screen saver and some type of game that was not very interesting."
4,Yawn,"This one wasn't as good as I expected, but I'm sure that's only because I've already read so many of these kinds of books about change. If you haven't, you'll like it, I'm sure."
1,WHO MOVED MY CHEESE,"It is as exactly as it as it as sounds...Cheesey.... this book is for children... it is unrealistic.... sure if you work for a company that is constantly changing you might relate to the book maybe a little....No, change is not a good thing when it happens on a regular basis. That means upper management can't make up their minds about any processes they are instituting into your work processes. And will be returning the same processes that you were working previous, within the year. Why??? You know why, as the old saying goes.... "" if it ain't broke,why fix it ?????But in all reality, the book , the story is childish,boring ,stupid, and for simple minded people that don't have an opinion or a backbone in their workplace. Need I say anymore ????"
1,The Handwriting Certainly IS on the Wall,"The real message of this book:You are a Little Person, don't expect security in lifeThe only one who cares about you is youYour survival depends on following us wherever we lead you (but we don't care about you)Do not question the premise of this system, that is only whiningAll change is good (well, not for you necessarily)Thoughtful obedience is preferred, but mindless obedience is acceptable"
1,Read Shakespeare instead!,"I was given this as mandatory reading at my work. I've just read it and feel cheated and horrified by such simplistic drivel. For insights into human nature, read poetry, read Shakespeare, read the Bible/Qu'ran/Torah but don't read this managerial marketing tool to get you conned into thinking that you can't handle change. And just in case you don't Get The Message of any section, there's a left hand page cheese illustration with THE MORAL MESSAGE SPELLED OUT FOR YOU! And then, in case you didn't really understand the whole story (!), there's a kind of sitcom after-the-last-ad-break scenario where Ordinary People Like You And Me apply the messages to their own situations. I don't think 'It's Amazing' as most internet reviewers do, I feel amazingly depressed that this kind of psychobabble is purported to be Deep and Meaningful. Read Robert Frost instead or Bruce Dawe."
3,Worth 20 minutes,"This is a cute little story, written in a similar style to that of Heroz and Zapp, both on empowerment (which are both fabulous). This pamphlet length hardcover volume conveys a very simple story about a few characters who must deal with change. They are used to going to a certian place each day to find cheese, which symbolizes a job, life satisfaction or whatever one may find to be of great importance in life. One day the supply of cheese is gone, the two mice immediately move on to find a new supply, while the two littlepeople, Hem and Haw, procrastinate and dwell over their loss. By simply moving on, and accepting the change the mice are better off.If you run across a copy of ""Who Moved My cheese?"" pick it up and read it, it's worth 20 minutes or so to read the meat of the book. It's a cute little story, from which you may learn something. The material this book contains amounts to less than that found in a Cliff Notes Volume, so you might actually read the whole thing."
1,A pathetic stab at corporate impunity,"A weak parable for the same mush minds who found Forrest Gump moving. This book is designed to prepare the dot com generation for their inevitable doom. Start sharpening those service industry skills, you yuppies! You'll need them in the dark days ahead..."
3,"Eh...read it, but only if it doesn't involve paying for it","Good: it makes you realize that there's no point in clinging to the past or spending lots of time worrying about change.Bad: Very oversimplified. Doesn't address how you're supposed to ""follow the cheese"" if you have 3 kids, a mortgage, jobs in your field are being outsourced left and right, and can't afford to go back to school."
2,"Don't choose ""cute"" over ""useful""","This book is adorable... little mice, little men. If you want to read a book to your children before bed, I would recommend it. However, Spencer Johnson has done little for the dynamics of change in the business world other than make a lot of money from it. In attemting to write the ultimate marketable fable, he has missed the mark on change in organizations. He makes change sound like some lurking force that randomly strikes us unless we're watching our cheese stack. It removes the ownership and accountability from our workers and makes us sound like victims. That's a shameful approach and philosophy to push. There are already too many people in our companies who feel as though they are victims. The little sound-bites posted throughout the book are pithy, but without much substance (with the possible exception of ""what would you do if you weren't afraid?""). In the future, real application and substance will be needed if I'm going to read a business story book."
1,Probably the worst book ever published!!!,"Hello,what does this book teach? Just nothing. The only message is: stay alert, you could lose your job fast. Get nervous. You are poor and you'll have to live with that for the rest of your life. Job is a sacred thing. Do whatever it takes not to lose it(the worst advice you can give to anybody).The book doesn't have a single answer for today's problems.Don't buy this book. The money is better used if you burn it (but don't burn it either).If you want real information about the subject of work buy instead: Guide to investing. What the rich invest in that the poor and middle class do not. Author: Robert Kiyosaki. It is the best book I have read about you and what you are doing with you life.Good luck with you life and beware who you choose as your ""advisor""."
4,Great read,This book makes you look at your life in a different perspective. Easy read and so simple. I highly recommend for anyone.
5,Who Moved My Cheese,"Book received in excellent condition. Very interesting read, will recommend to my children... We can learn a lot from when you're opened to change..."
3,Easy read,"This was an easy read, however, you will need to read another book to really have applicable points to use in your life."
4,Bought this as an ebook gift,For my daughter who is moving into her first leadership role at work. Good entry level instruction or experienced refresher. Highly recommended.
5,Who Moved my Cheese,I bought this book for my Grandson who graduated from the University a couple of years ago. He is going through a transition in his personal life. This book was highly recommended and I believe it will guide him in the right path.
1,Cheeze Whiz is more like it,"I must admit to gaining insight with the reading of this book. I want to go back and see if the copyright is expired on ""The Little Engine that Could"". What's next, management philosophies published as coloring books?I think I can...I think I can..."
1,It's not easy being this cheesy!,"Obviously the author found his cheese. Only he didn't eat it, he packaged it up and sold it to the ""littlepeople."" The first thing I noticed when reading this book was that it has built-in defense mechanisms. People who disagree w/ this cheez are not ""adapting,"" don't want to ""learn,"" and are dubbed ""Hems"" just bcz they're not buying what he's selling. If you had any confidence in your message, why get so defensive only four pages in? I also agree .... that this book is a plus for management bcz it lets them believe that they are only moving cheese which is actually good for people and really not shafting anyone."
2,For those who hate to read,"This is a 20 minute read with a 1-minute message. If you keep on doing what you're doing, you'll keep on getting what you've got. What's remarkable is the list price of this book. Considering the size of the type and brevity of the story, a very overpriced pamphlet."
1,Wolves in Monks Clothing,"The cheese is desire, we are all in a maze called life chasing the cheese. True. And we all need to realize that change is the one certainty. We are happiest when we let go of clinging to our idea of cheese and live in reality, truly living genuine, open lives. (You have just read the book- dont bother buying it.) What makes me ill is that all this simplicity and truth seems to be a corporate way of saying that you had better buck up and have a good attitude because all Hem's are history. Insult to injury, it really IS written at about a 3rd grade reading level. ""See Spot run!"" can be life changing, too... if it is the first book you have ever read about dogs."
2,An insultingly simplistic homily about change in life,"""Who Moved My Cheese"" makes its point - that we tend to be paralyzed with fear without justification over change - in its first two pages, then beats us unmercifully with it for another ninety-six. The gift of this book from a superior or coworker is tantamount to receiving a bottle of Scope anonymously. Save the 45 minutes you would spend reading this, update your resume, and get a new job. You got the same lesson, and didn't feel as if you'd just read ""Winnie The Pooh Loses His Honey"", which would no doubt be just as useful and not quite as insulting."
1,"Don't waste your money on this ""book""","This is, by far, the most idiotic book I have ever read. It is hyped up as a book on dealing with change. So, I am sorry to say that I even bought copies for friends who are going through some difficult life changes. To my disappointment, the book attempts to promote blind conformance to change, regardless of whether it is a good change or a bad one, or whether it violates your values or not. It fully insults your intelligence and attempts to strip you from qualities like loyalty, dedication, or critical thinking. Just think! USA would not exist if Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and others just said ""Oh, well! The British just moved our cheese. We just have to move with the cheese."" Really, the book is such a waste of money, time, and paper!"
1,Who Moved His Common Sense?,"This book is about 100 pages of common sense mixed with a story on the reading level of a 3rd grader, perhaps lower. I'll now save you the time and money this book demands from you, be ready for change. There you go. The writing is simplistic, the points are all common sense wrapped around cheese analogies, and the author spends 20% of the book shilling his own story, which you just read. Avoid this book at all costs. It is yet another example of ""literature"" that corporations look to for a quick fix to their problems."
1,Cheese Flavoured Opium for the Little People,"The contempt and hate the American CEO class has for it's workforce (the little people) is the real theme of this book.It's frightening and depressing that so many managers bought it (allegedly by the crateload in some cases) and gave it to their employees, and forced them to read it.In corporate America, 'change' is often a euphemism for 'mass layoff' which makes this little book even more sinister. One of many questions it fails to answer is 'What if the cheese has moved to India?'"
3,Who moved my cheese,"We are creatures of habit. The status quo appeals and any change makes us feel as trapped. who moved my cheese addresses change that happens regardless of whether we like it or not. How do we cope with change, redundancy, a new working partner, a new baby....sudden illness. As long as we live and breathe nothing is as certain as change. This book is a gift to help us understand the reasons for change and how to cope with even the most dire changes and the unexpected circumstances."
1,This...book has NOTHING to do with Cheese!!!!,"I was severely disapointed. As a Canadian, we take our cheese very seriously. I saw the title, and thought perhaps it was a new type of suspense novel, about the rarely discussed 'cheese napping's'. Imagine my disgust when I found out that its a mediocre self help book.... and still.... NO CHEESE! This is false advertising. If you are looking for REAL information about cheese, seach the archives of the [url]"
2,"Ok, I guess.....","This is an ok book, but I kept waiting to find out what type of cheese Spence likes to eat. I wanted to find out and then why someone would want to take another mans cheese? I know that I like Gouda. It tastes great and leaves no greasy after stains. Anyway if you need help for life et. al. This book attempts to show you how. Still needs more about cheese."
2,Corporate propaganda,"While there are genuine parts in this book which can be used in our personal lives, the book is totally corporate propaganda.It is meant for us to be happy to run around aimlessly at the whim of our corporate and government masters who have the rights to alter our lives in anyway they see fit. Also, to remember that if you complain about this, you will negatively influence others, and don't help, care or unite others (unionize), they had their chance."
4,It makes you think.,This is a very insightful book on human nature and how different people respond to change. It make you reflect on your own attitudes and behavior when change is a foot in your own life. Great for starting a group of people in a new direction.
3,Pretty cheezy,"This book was given to me at work, to help all of us at the company to ""embrace the change"". While it gets the message across, overall it's just too simplistic, too stereotypical and too cheezy. Many coworkers were dissapointed as well. We did have some great cheese jokes for a while :)"
2,"Strong messages, weak book","I am a sophomore in high school, and our English class just finished reading this book. Very few people enjoyed it, and most of us were annoyed by the way the metaphors were presented and beaten over our heads. They were very simplistic and fairly obvious, and lacked in creativity. Though the messages were strong, helpful, and true, the book as a whole left something to be desired."
1,Spare me,"This is considered a No. 1 business best seller? Give me a break. My 10-yar-old daughter could write a more detailed book. This is the rip-off of the year. I can't believe I fell for this. I only wish I had back the 25 minutes it took me to read it. Don't waste your time, or your money!"
4,excellent and purposefully vague,"This is a story about how to handle change. The story is purposefully vague as change is always different. The 4 characters in the story are archetypes of how people handle change: searching, activity, planning, and resisting. I read this story not from a business perspective, but from a therapy perspective. I have several clients that I feel could benefit from this book.Here is one observation that I made about the REVEIWERS: If they liked it they applied it to themselves, if they hated it they just critique the story and find its holes they never look at themselves...Makes you wonder why they were given the book in the first place..."
3,Who Moved My Cheese?,"The book is entertaining, easy to read and has elements that would make any reader self analyze. I don't think though that it can change the way we think and our attitude towards change."
1,Usual cheesey stuff,"This is a typical meaningless self improvement book. We were forced to read it at a previous company. Basically if you think you are so bad you really need help from this book I would give up now and head for the nearest cliff. I much prefer the parody ""Who cut my cheese"" by Stilton Jarlsberg - a much more satisfying read."
4,Who Moved My Cheese,The product arrived in very good condition! Although it wasn't delivered until the very last day of the predicted period of arrival.
3,"An odd, but interesting little book...","This book is very easy to read, with a moral even a mouse could 'get' a few pages in. Although it is very short and easy to read though, I had to keep putting it down as the author's style of writing was a bit odd to my taste. I'd recommend it though, as worthwhile reading in say, a Doctor's/Dentist's office, or while waiting for a flight."
4,Learn who you are...,by reading this book. This is a great parable that can be related to any struggle we have in life.I would recommend this book to everyone from young adults and up.
1,A book for managers,"This is a book written for company managers to make them feel good about themselves when they are making unthought-out changes that drastically affect employees. Now they can say ""Here, read this book. It will help."" The book says that if you have low intellegence, no loyalty, don't think, and have no ethics, you will be happy and aimlessly move from job to job. If you have any of these qualities, you will be miserable. The only way I can see this book being so successful, is that managers buy them by the hundreds. It is not worth the paper it was written on."
2,Not impressed,This book is about accepting change but not how to embrace it. It is a very easy book to read because it is a story format. This book did not help me deal with change in my life.
3,Unique - but doesn't quite live up to its hype,"With a plethora of self-help books on the market and with a similar number dealing with ""work self-help"" new books have a problem. They have to enter a crowded market and carve their own 'niche'.This book does that insofar as the method of storytelling and the book's basic approach make it both unique and accessible to the its most likely readers.However the book leaves one disappointed. There isn't much 'new' here - it's the presentation that serves to clarify points that have been stated by others many times in other books.Again as another reviewer said - you could probably read this from the library and not need to buy it. However if it's your first book of this type, it may be worth it for you to purchase the book.This book reminds one of an athlete who has a lot of 'potential' coming out of college but only shows occasional flashes of brilliance during their career."
1,Don't believe the hype,"Don't buy this book. There are no great insights to be gained. The only point in the book is that things change, accept this fact and be positive. The parable is a gimmick.There is one amusing aspect of the book where the author attempts to diffuse criticism by presenting a discussion in which one character says he already understands the theme of the book and found the book unnecessary. The other characters in the discussion then laugh at the naysayer as being unable to accept change.I'll buy the naysayer a beer anytime. The mocking characters are all so naive and sheltered as to be insufferable."
4,Fun & Entertaining,"Yes, this book is somewhat over simplified, but as an instructor at a technical college, I constantly encounter people who are so afraid of change that they won't leave school or their minimum wage job to move on to better ""cheese."" I have found that those most resistant to change are those who are in the middle of change and can't cope with it. Take a lesson from Haw and learn to laugh at yourself, you'll find you cope much better."
2,Needs an Afterword,"Because this book is being used by ""... many corporations, governmental agencies, the military, small businesses, hospitals, churches and schools..."", I wish that Dr. Johnson had put in an afterword for managers in his little fable. You see, some employees have been so abused in some previous situation that they aren't just afraid of change, they're too traumatized to believe that a change could be for the better. I'm disappointed that a medical doctor didn't think to include some symptoms to look for to help differentiate a formerly abused employee from a mere Hem. It would have been even more helpful if he had included sound medical advice on where to seek help for formerly abused employees. As for the story itself, if others find it helpful, good luck to them. I found the style annoyingly condescending, particularly from an author whom I do not consider to have thought things through before he wrote."
4,A simplistic outlook on life.,This is an amazing little book if you read it with an open mind. The book is about change and what happens to those of us who are not willing to change. I think a lot of people who rated this book so low did not see the hidden message. Give the book a chance. It only takes about an hour to read and maybe it might change your perspective on a few issues as well.
3,Thought Provoking,"The book is an easy and quick read but the story will put thoughts in your head that you will think about for years if not a lifetime. Life brings us all challenges so this book is for all of us... That is, unless your life is perfect."
3,Insights to an important idea,"If change is frightening or difficult, you will find helpful insights in this short, entertaining story. The power and weakness of the book comes from its simplicity. We are reminded that change is the only constant, the only sure thing we can bet on. By embracing change, we can learn to anticipate, adjust and adapt. In other words, our response to change is very much the result of how we think about it. The book uses a simple story to make these and other important points. This is a great book for managers who are trying to understand how to adapt to the fast changing business environment of the Internet Age. If you do not expect to find all the answers in one place you will enjoy this very quick read."
5,A Corporate Helper,"Being a part of a multi-million dollar corporation involved in a change of mission and vision, I found this book, which takes about 45 minutes to read, a fresh perspective with ideas I couldn't put my finger on before. I'ts equally helpful for executives, sales, management, and support staff alike."
5,Organizational change,"This book was used as reading material prior to a business strategic planning session. Though there may be any new information, for the 40+ people in attendance, it certainly helped to set the stage for the work that needed to be accomplished.This book as value for not only those included in organaztional planning, but personal planning as well. What are we going to be when we grow up?Well worth the time!"
3,This cheese became moldy after a short time!,"I am a business student who has had the theme of change beaten into my brain in almost every class I've taken. Living, working, and going to school here in Silicon Valley, you get very accustomed to change. Therefore this book lacks the force it would otherwise have if it offered something new.After reading the first two short chapters, it became all too predictable. In fact, I found it's use of metaphors to be its only novelty."
1,What to call your company's Softball team...,"""The Cheese Movers"" from ""How to Work for an Idiot"" by John Hoover...When you are handed a copy as a bulk buy by your manager go out and buy John Hoovers book, its a lot funnier than this one!Just don't display Mr Hoovers book anywhere in your cubicle.."
2,Here is what this book should be named,"The book is ok as long as you understand that it's used by management to get people to quickly swallow what is feed to them. In fact this book is great under two conditions. First: If your your own boss responsible for your companys direction, then it is great to think this way as you react to market conditions. Second: If you are an employee and your willing to quickly fall into step and eat whatever your boss wants to feed you. From the employees point of view it should have been titled. READ THIS BECAUSE I MOVED YOUR CHEESE."
4,WHO MOVED MY CHEESE?,"After reading Who Moved my Cheese? I attempted to find something that I could disagree with, but could find nothing. From a nursing superisor perspective, I can see those who are stuck, and reluctant to change they are unhappy and make everyone around them unhappy. There is only one issue that I wished was addressed, how do you inspire others to move with the cheese, or is this perhaps another story? I found this book interesting as well as entertaining, although a little cute. I think it could be inspiring to those who are stuck in the proverbial rut. I would recommend it to anyone who is contemplating change or is in need of a change."
1,This book deserves 0 stars,"I have a general rule when it comes to books. Anything sold at FedEX isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Who Moved My Cheese is sold at FedEX. The book is perfect for less-than-intelligent managers who want to justify their latest round of layoffs to their employees by simply saying ""well, you should get back on your feet"".This book illustrates the anti-intellectual and shameful practices of corporatism."
1,Avoid like the plague. It's all hype. You've been warned.,Worthless and simplistic nonsense. This rag is often passed around offices by middle managers who have no idea how to manage in the first place.Insulting to anyone with an I.Q. over 10. Obvious messages. A trite (and flawed) allegory. Useless for actually fixing what is wrong in many offices.
2,Nice little book -could damage morale if not used properly,"The book introduces the concepts of change in a simple, somewhat easy to digest form. Some can absorb the parable and use the information for personal change while others will be horribly insulted and offended by its potential Orwellian undertones. If your company uses this book as a an instrument for change be very carefull to do your homework as this book is an introduction to change, not an end all authoritative source. If misused or badly implemented, you will sow a silent distrust in employees that can never be repaired."
2,Cheesy.,"I hate change. It is my biggest weakness.When I was recommended to read `Who Moved My Cheese,' I was looking for a thick, hard cover book with gold wordings and a dark background in the self-improvement section. But it turned out to be the exact opposite. With a book so thin and words written in font size 16 (I think), I wondered if I could get anything out of it. And I'm still wondering if I did.A childlike story that gets its point across, it's easy for the reader to grasps the importance of embracing change. I think Dr. Johnson was going for a simple story with a huge impact. The discussion part at the end of the book helps the reader understand better by applying real scenarios we go through everyday in our personal and work life.When I was done with the final page, I agreed with Dr. Johnson wholeheartedly. I understood the story and the dangers of resisting change. But so what? We all know that. It just wasn't inspiring and motivating enough for a stubborn mule like me."
1,No more cheese please!,I was forced to read this book for a company I worked for that was thoroughly embracing the whole concept. I've never seen as much hype about something so common sense as I have this book. Anyone who has ever worked a day in his/her life would know as much as this book supposedly introduces us to.Don't get rooked on this moldy piece of cheese. Save your money and have a conversation with an older person who has lived through some strife.
4,"Instructive, but with one big flaw...","... which is that there are many different KINDS of cheese and that the choices in life often involve tradeoffs. My work life offers me Camembert, Cheddar, and Mozzarella, but not Brie - I know that, miss it, but can't justify changing it on those grounds. Seldom does ""all"" the cheese disappear - it's more a matter of SOME of it going away.Past that, it's often good advice to change - and to ensure that what you're doing is getting you ""cheese"" of some kind or another."
1,simplistic beyond belief,"The ideas in this book could have been expressed in a paragraph and even then they would not have been worth the time to read them. He creates a simplistic ""mouse and cheese"" analogy, fails to explain it and then pretends it has profound implications for how we live our lives. How does stuff like this even get published?"
2,Cheese (money) robber...,"The moral of this book reiterates what is already commonsense for most people, which is life sometimes changes unexpectedly. Obviously some people deal with change better than others, but the sheer overly simplistic tone of this book made it agonizing to read at points (especially the end). If this book is floating around your office, be weary. In my eyes it's simply corporate propaganda conjured up and deployed to train employees on how to best deal with erratic and continuously changing work environments. In other words, regardless if we (your company) move your cheese: live with it, love it, and move on.Save your money..."
2,Not for everyone,"This book can be interesting in realizing how some people react to changing situations, but it doesn't provide much insight to those who love change and think it's good to begin with. If you like change & are looking to learn something, this book's probably not what you're looking for. I found it a waste of time."
2,Disappointed,"Great title and thoughts but more of an essay than a book. I had hoped that it would have some great insights relayed in an approachable story form. But in the end, it's too simple and doesn't have the substance I hoped for. It's setup in 3 parts and only the 2nd part about the mice/people really belongs in the book. The other parts are there to fill pages and aren't worth reading. This is one book that isn't going to change your life, but will fill 20 minutes of your lunch hour with ""some"" entertainment."
4,Great Book - even BETTER price,I had been wanting to purchase this book for my team to read. We have been going through some changes and I wanted them to see the power of a positive outlook. Purchasing these books on line made it possible for me to not only buy these books to share but to buy enough that the team was able to take them home and keep them if they wanted. Thanks!!
3,Why it is better to be aware of change.,"As it states, this book can be read in one hour, which is not a huge investment. It is a simple fable about how people take change. Some accept it, some relish it, and as always there are those who fight it and don't accept it. I know many of the later in my life of work. They answer, we do it this way, and that is the way we should do it.I think this book is a simple tale of how we should react to change. We should always be prepared to accept change. If you plan of purchasing this book, purchase it as a used book. Although the tale is good about the need for change, I don't think it warrants the new book charge."
5,Change is Good!,"This book is fantastic. It shows that by altering your attitude, you can make embracing change that is needed a positive and resisting change a negative. This adjustment reverses how most people are wired."
1,How can this be?,"I think I got through the introduction of this book before I started skimming through to find substance. For anyone thinking of reading this book the summary will nicely do. ""Adapt and enjoy life."" Without a worthless story about mice that could have been written in a three sentence paragraph and then a poor comparison to over-simplified personas without any real-to-life application this book would be only slightly less meaningless. Go buy some colby and Ritz crackers, you will have a better time. This truely is a business-gift tome of worthless application. If you see it floating around your office, or worse yet, are given it by someone higher up. Beware!"
1,Who Moved My Brain?,"There are 4 characters in the first part of this book, the first two are mindless rodents and the second two are ""little people."" All 4 characters spend their lives hunting cheese in a maze. The characters that are set forth to be imitated are the mindless rodents. If you still don't get the picture than you probably belong in a maze chasing cheese that someone else keeps moving and would probably enjoy this book. Motorola loved to place signs around about ""Change is Good"" just before they closed their paging infrastructure plant and sold it to the competition. The last company I was with encouraged everyone to read this book just before they had a mass layoff. If your company starts passing out this book, ""sniff out change"" and update your resume."
2,He got paid for this?,"Adapt or die.There. I just saved you $12.If you didn't know that the times, they are a'changin', then you might want to read this book. Otherwise, save yourself the time and expense and go watch ""The Apprentice"" instead. You'll probably learn more about business strategies than you would by reading this thin volume."
5,Act Upon-Don't Resist Change.,"That's right, if change didn't happen the world we live in would be lifeless. This quick, easy to read little story is wonderful. I appreciate the author's presentation of how to deal with change in this pleasantly simple story-telling format. It made it easy to look at how I deal with change.What came to mind when I read the section on fear was my current situation of needing to find a new tenant for a vacant apartment I have. At first I wanted the current tenant to remain in our apartment-but realized that she needed to move on. I am now moving with confidence in the direction of finding a new tenant.If you enjoyed this book, I highly recommend another book called ""Working On Yourself Doesn't Work"" written by Ariel & Shya Kane. The Kanes' book is a guide for personal transformation, where the discovery of life's magic is a daily habit."
1,Who Moved My Cheese?,"The managers at my place of employment left this book out for the employees to read. I found this book to be overly simplistic and downright insulting! Fairytales about mice in jogging suits might be fine for five-year olds, but I consider myself to be an adult and a professional. One's money might be better spent having lunch with one's co-workers and discussing ways to work together better and become happier and more productive."
2,save your $ on some thing else...,"i totally agreed with the Spotlight Reviews' (from A. Petrotchenkov and Bruce Silverman) comments, i do not find this book that much of inspiring...the story line is not too convincing either; If the story was rewritten as ""the Cheese automatic shows up every day (like in a big real warehouse), and have been late few times before...etc"" then it may be able to say Hem still have hope it may be late again this time, and willing to take the chance to wait for it to shows up again...etc.well... in short, all it trying to say is: ""life is tough, move on! or else - you will be history!""now, go spend your $ to get some nice ice cream instead...."
1,who moved my cheese,"Another prove that ""best-seller"" does not alway mean that a book is good. I was really disappionted. Intersting idea about sellecting mice characters but in fact there is nothing there. ""Empty"" story with no message. Morever, boring."
4,"OH NO, HERE COMES CHANGE!","""Who Moved My Cheese?"" by Spencer Johnson brings up a topic that everyone in life faces, change. People from various economic backgrounds and ehtnicities all experience change. The book, metaphorically speaking uses ""cheese"" as the ultimate desire of life for an idividual. For some it is a new home, for others it's having lots of money, or even poplularity. When peoples' cheese moves, they become chaotic. ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" is an excellent resource for people who are leaders in life. So that means we all can benefit, whether we are leaders of a corporation, household, or even of a classroom. It works as a guide setting fourth a productive and positive ethic for this journey called life."
2,just about okay,"one thing i've noticed about these motivational books is that they are such a drag... everything that ought to be said can be said in just one line... yes it's true that you may need to explain the message via 2-3 good examples...but after that... we all do get the point! like we don't need reassurance of your point in 20,000 different ways!good message... but could have been told in a more interesting way by drawing closer analogies to the human mind..."
1,A bound shibboleth,"Someone who I know extolled this book and therefore, I wasted neither my time nor money on it. As an alternative to this tripe, if you are interested in the topic of change, read ""Future Shock"" by Alvin Toffler. First published in 1970, it is a modern classic of culture today."
3,Quick Service,"Quick Service, but didnt mention book was missing cover. I would have bought anyway, but should have been told upfront."
1,wish I could give it zero stars,"Let me save you some money and give you the gist of the book in five words: ""Things change. Deal with it.""""Simplistic"" is being too kind. ""Awful"" is more like it."
5,I even got my father to read it!,"Wow! This is an amazing book! I was working in a book fair, and one night I sold 64 books, and 23 books out of that was this one. I liked it so much, I gave it to my father. my father didn't touch a book since god knows when. He isn't that well for like a year. It took him less then a week to read this book and he called me and asked who else read tjis book from our family and said I must give it to my sisters and mother. This is a great book. It takes like an Hour reading it all. Enjoy!"
3,"Fun to read at first, but one mistake","Fun book, except for on page 44 Haw paints a picture in his mind: ""He saw himself venturing out into the maze with a smile on his face."" Hem never adapts to change. The discussion afterward gets boring. On page 87 Angela says, ""The most powerful part of the story was when Hem laughed at his fear and went on to paint a picture in his mind, where he saw himself enjoying New Cheese."" Weird mistake to write that ""Even Hems can sometimes see the advantage of changing,"" (p. 87) when in the story Hem never did see any advantage of change?"
5,It's all about life,This book makes the reader reflect on their own personal life (and others) to spotlight life's quaranteed encounters and how to handle the circumstances. It is well written. A book I suggest for anyone to read at least once in their lifetime.
4,They moved it to the school!,"Well, our teacher used this book for our school graduation, to attempt to help us adjust to change. It was an interesting metaphor, and I had never known that I had been going to ""Cheese Station Crestwell"" for all these years. Shortly after graduation, I read the book. It's interesting, and I reccomend it to anyone who's having a change in their life."
5,A Book About Changes.......,"This book brings about chnages, not only in your spiritual life, but goes beyond the outer realms of one's communication towards family, friends, co-workers, bosses, and even in church. This book brings to life the role you will play in helping others to see that CHANGE IS A GOOD THING.Having changes done in your life causes you to see your actions and reactions differently."
4,Change Management,"While some reviewers take a dim view of Spencer Johnson's parable of change, ""Who Moved My Cheese?,"" it's possible that they are missing his point. Johnson never intended to write an encyclopedia of change management. Instead, he has written a post-modern narrative of four different responses to change in our ever-changing world.""Who Moved My Cheese?"" is a light-hearted but practical reminder that change happens. It teaches the basic lesson, in story form, that only those prepared for change by having the right attitude toward change can survive change. It does so by telling the story of four ""characters"" and their personal responses to change. Each an allegory of potential responses--two positive and two negative.Those wanting more in-depth information on change management might want to read ""Good to Great"" and ""Build to Last"" by Collins, or ""Transitioning"" by Southerland.Reviewer: Dr. Bob Kellemen, author of ""Soul Physicians"" and ""Spiritual Friends."""
4,"Simple, yet profound!","Like the parables Jesus uses in the Bible, the message is simple yet profound; IF you are wise enough to perceive it. And that about says it all.I highly recommend this book to anyone, but to TEENAGERS in particular!!! Rolling with the punches will save you years of heart ache. Years you can't get back by the way. I wish I would have read this book 10 years ago when it was first recommended to me."
4,cute story,"Cute life story, not just valid for your work life but a good way to look at your life in general"
4,good enough,"I have read the book and have recommended it. Of course this book doesn't have a gold mine of business concepts or any thing other than hey wake up and smell the cheese, well its gone and its time to move on. Believe it or not there is business people who continue on spending time and hard earn money on processes, ideas, products, and guess what entire business organizations that are easily seen by outsiders as finished. But not unless you have been in the situation or have helped someone get out of it, then you will understand the true value of this book. Recommending this book to someone who doesn't need it, will get you a negative response so be careful when doing so. Every business person should have it in their library, just to remind them how easily we can blind ourselves and chase after dead opportunities."
2,RIP-OFF,"This is a very cute story with nice insights. Nothing I might add that you did not already know. However, it simply is not worth the $16.99 price tag. I was able to read it to my husband in under 45 minutes. Simply not enough meat for the price. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
2,THE most important thing to know about this book,"If your department is ever given several copies of this book, that means that management is going to fire most of you. Trust me on this."
1,My 4-year-old loved it...,"Although the idea behind this tale is good, the parable itself is sophomoric and simply goes on and on and ON AND ON... I was gripping my steering wheel in frustration and gritting my teeth: ""Just get to the moral of the story, already!"" (However, my 4-year-old sitting in the back seat found the story about the funny little men and the mice totally absorbing. This should tell you something.)"
1,the emperor has NO CLOTHES,"Do yourself a favor: DON'T jump on this bandwagon. Join the ranks of those of us who have read this and revolted: the emporer is naked. Can we all just admit it and get this OFF the topsellers list? There is NOTHING of value in this book. ""The Story"" is too stupid to even qualify as trite."
4,Short and great,"Wonderful little fable about change and how to deal with it. Change will happen, there's nothing you can do about it. It's much easier if you're prepared and even if you're not prepared it's much easier if you get moving once it happens rather than sit back and complain about it. Reminded me of a line I wrote in my first poetry collection ""Like everything in life, things change. Those who change with them live, those who don't die."""
2,What a piece...,"I read this book and felt that the concept, while useful, did not resonate with my experience. The book strikes me as mindless and intelectually insulting.I think a much better book for managing change in one's life is ""LifeLaunch: A Passionate Guide to the Rest of Your Life"" by Hudson and McLean. If you found ""Who Moved My Cheese"" as too shallow and pedantic like I did, I would recommend looking into ""LifeLaunch""."
3,Who moved my cheese,"Interesting. Helps you to keep up the good work, or not to get downhearted when you think you're losing. Accepting the situation as it is, and making changes where and when necessary."
2,You gotta be kidding!,"It's cute, it's quaint, it's memorable. Yes, the book will become a ""meme"" for everyone. But I cannot believe people don't already know this. On the other hand, maybe people have gotten so caught up in their lives they've forgotten the basics. Don't buy it, though--borrow it or check it out of the library. Take the 30 mins it requires to read it, and then you too can say you know what people are talking about. Then, get on with your life."
3,Simplistic,This book is not for anyone who has had any formal management training. The notion of managing for change has been done many times before--the useful tidbit in this book is that doing something is almost always better than doing nothing--a 75% correct solution implemented quickly is much better than a 100% solution implemented in 6 months. I'm not sure why this book has had the success it has--except for the cute parable format.
3,Long live the allegory,"You can read this in less than 30 mins. A quick, simple allegory about change & transition.More than one person has given it to their staff/managers in a less-than-subtle hint.An interesting ratio to note: the story is 73 pages (A5 in large print), and the ""About the Author"" section is 2 pages."
1,Is our business leaders realy this ignorant...,"Just as the lazy person look's for a pill to make them thin so does the lazy mind look to this simplistic nursery rhyme for insight. Grow up people it is time to get beyond Mother Goose for inspiration. Go read W. E. Deming or Peter Drucker and if they have to many words or pages for you to read (please tell me who is so busy they don't have time to read the 70 pages of this ""Cheesy Book"" that they need a Audio Cassette version?) at least try ""Management of the Absurd"" It is quick read yet sill has challanging idea of quality.PS I have it on good word Spencer Johnson and Kenneth H. Blanchard next Book is abut Two aging Robins with the title ""Who Stole my Nest Egg"""
1,drivel,"This is a book about just accepting what is given, and not asking any questions. It is not about hope, and not about growth. It is about accepting the status quo. Of course managers like it, it tells people to just shut up and be content. It is all beyond your control anyway (so Dr. Spencer would tell us).One star is too generous. Your time would be better spent just taking a nap."
1,A slap in the face,"This book is a waste of the paper it was printed on as well as an insult to intelligent people. My husband had a copy given to him by of all people, a senior manager at his place of employment who had decided that all the workers who were about to be laid off would somehow benefit from this added slap in the face. Apparently, no-one was moving HIS cheese or perhaps he would have realized that being told to change your paradigm is not all that helpful to loyal workers about to find themselves out on the street. If it were possible to give this book less than any stars, I would do it."
2,Overrated and overly simpistic - much better options exist.,"This book is simply not worthy of the acclaim it has received. It probably sells well because it is such a short and easy read, but the information in the book is obvious, oversimplistic, and not useful if you are a manager looking for better performance from your team.If you are looking for a book that will help you as a manager to get more out of your workers, try ""First, Break all the Rules"" by Marcus Buckingham. It will take you more time to read than this slim little booklet, but you will come away from the book with ideas you can implement in your business."
1,A bit to trivial,"Even for its modest price, this book contains only very little content. All you need to know can be summarized on one page; in fact the author has just done that. Everything around that one page contains a not very interesting story."
1,This Cheezy Book,"I cannot think of a last time when I've read such a mindless so-called ""book"" and fumed with such anger! I am not sure what insulted me more: the banality of the story or the ""before"" and ""after"" commentary by the author. Since the book is written in a kindergarten English, the author, probably, assumes that his readers are unable to comprehend the simplistic message of the story. If you are looking for a good self-improvement book that teaches you how to positively deal with, accept, and/or affect changes in your life, please pass this one and invest in Brian Tracy's ""Maximum Achievement"". Otherwise, you can simply ask yourself a million dollar question:"" What would I do if I did not feel this fear?"" If, on the other hand, you are planning to accept change mindlessly, as the mice does, then shut up, and be prepared to spend your life forever searching for your happiness (cheese) in a maze of someone else's making!"
1,Way too cheesy!,Hyperbolic title and self review. Laughably simplistic (although some will undoubtedly say the simplictiy is what makes it good).
4,You're Making it too Difficult!!!,"First I'll say that this is NOT a unique concept but still a quick and easy way to relay a good point which is to not be content and keep looking for ways to improve your life. When confronting a difficult situation in your life, always ask ""What would you do if you weren't afraid?""Second, I'm sorry so many of you are ANGRY at the existence of the book/story. So what if the HR dept makes you read it? It takes 30 minutes out of your life.Third, you either get it or you don't. If you have the capacity of mind to ponder then read the book. If you don't have the ability to ponder, don't buy the book...you won't 'get it' and you'll just be angry like the other people who wanted to actually read a book about cheese and mice with no moral behind it."
1,"If your boss gives you this book, watch out!!","""I like to give this book out to all my employees before I lay them off. It helps the realize the importance of not resisting change and diverts their energies to infighting among theselves. It also makes me feel less guilty. Whenever I meet someone I poleaxed recently, I think to myself, 'Sure I fired you. But at least you got a parting gift.' This book is like businessmen's Turtle Wax. I heartily recommend that every ruthless corporate raider buy it in bulk before going on a hatchet spree."" - from Mason Brown's parody, ""Who Cut the Cheese"" available through Amazon.com"
2,Obvious,"Not only did I think the ""cutesy"" story was corny, the lessons in the book were so obvious it was almost insulting. I would like to see how much impact this book would have on someone not opened to change."
2,Who priced this book?,"Retail for this nursery rhyme is around $.... Give me strength. It's a nice motivational piece that you can read in an hour, but my advice is to let somebody else pay for it as I did."
4,Inspirational and Truthful!!,"This is definitely a book that anyone can relate to family, work, or relationships. Your children could view the story as a fairy tale. You can relate to each character in the book. I immediately related it to my work environment and the various interactions I have with my peers. It is very easy to remain in your ""comfort zone"" rather than facing change head on and adapting. It is a short book(less than 100 pages) which I highly recommend. It can easily be read in a couple of hours."
1,At least not with real money ...,"Change for the sake of change ... get used to it? Hmmmm .... sounds more like the free advise I've received from a couple of my X's. Not sure I'd want to pay for that sort of rhetoric again ... at least not with real money.On the other hand, there is a positive message in this pseudo self-help cliche sort of cutzie book, and that is that one can CHOOSE to allow fear to immobilize one's life to a point of seemingly no return.I seriously doubt if this book changed the lives of the fear-slave masses, but if it helped even a single person ... good. Then again I'm somewhat of an eternal optimist, wrapped in a realist, inside a skeptic. ;)MFJLabs"
2,"suprise, suprise....","I just ordered this book and I was more then suprised when has arived. The book ofered 96 pages of reading with blocks of letteres big enough to read it from any of Ljubljana scyscrapers. As normal, this one couldn't less more then 40 pages. So I try to put my disappointment away by reading this pile of paper. And it was the same. It statrts very promising, but soon this promise diminished in quite demeaning manner. Maybe this book is just good enough for HS kid. I was expecting book dealing with many ways of changing, specialy with it's practical look. But this was kind of a new-age mambo jambo, which is solving problems in black&white manner. It's a good start but don't expect to much. Try to find new cheese."
1,This cheese sure stinks!,"Wildly popular brainwashing tool for use by managers; intended to prevent discontent among the serfs when corporate purges are launched. The book is presented in the form of a cute kiddie story in order to make the displaced servants subconsciously feel that any negative reaction they may have to the changes is petty and childish.If your manager starts passing this book out at meetings, be sure your resume is updated.I normally am opposed to book burning, but in the case of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" I will make an exception. I wish I lived in a world where poison garbage like this was never even thought of."
2,"Simplistic, but it has a message","This is a very small and not overly challenging book with a simplistic message. Underneath the fable of the mice and the men, Johnson is dealing with change: how change can come with little warning, how different people react differently to change, how people prefer to be snug and safe and therefore fear change. The cheese here is an allegory for whatever you may value, be it money, relationships, even just cheese! What happens when your cheese suddenly vanishes and you cannot seem to get it? Do you sit and wait in the hope it will return? Do you try to find out what happened and thereby get hold of some more cheese? The book has a message so do not get put off by the fable format. What seems to be obvious and common sense is not always so in real life and sometimes a silly fable helps like a poke in the ribs. Worth a read but I find the bestseller rankings hard to believe!"
4,"Quick, thought provoking, could even change your life!","This book will take about an hour of your time. If, however, you take the tasty little tale and apply the principles, it may be one of the best hours you've ever spent. A lot of what is written here will be familiar. What makes it a best-seller is that it has been refashioned into easily remembered concepts through the engaging story of men, mice, and the pursuit of the ever elusive cheese...it's a parable about the importance of change and the need to remain open to new possibilities. Good stuff, simple packaging, accessible and applicable to everyone."
4,"Good, easy to read, interesting book","I thought this was a great book - it spoke to me about finding my passion and putting all my energy into that. It also spoke to me about how we need to not settle for second best, to have faith in what we are doing, and how we can find bigger and better things in life, if we only keep searching!! and not rest on what we have already accomplished..."
2,A mindless book,"This is a mindless book - it assumes (1) all change is good, and (2) that you are better off if you adapt to it quickly. Not all change in life is like the shifting cheese in a maze described by the book; in fact, I'd say most change is NOT like that.The simplistic view it holds is rather patronizing, but worse is if you actually try to base your life on this philosophy. It's not wise to do so. Everything should be evaluated against your standards, and what is good, you follow. What is bad/evil/poor, you avoid. You don't give your mind over to ""change is always good"" mantra if you are a thinking person. After all, who says where the cheese moves is good? That question/discussion is never addressed.Borrow this book from somewhere to read it if you wish - don't waste your money purchasing it."
1,Corporate Claptrap,"I was handed this to read by my manager at a large company that was recently devoured --- er, merged --- by a gigantic corporate empire. I read the first half, then disgustedly scanned the rest, making a mental note to update my resume that night. The message I got: Be a nice little lemming and jump off the cliff with the rest of the wonderful little rodents who follow our leaders blindly until they take mercy on you and let you drown. Thank goodness I didn't have to buy it, but I want those 20 minutes of my life back!"
1,Simple...or plain stupid?,"Granted. We have all the information (and more) we can absorb in our lifetime. We do not need any more of it: we just need to understand it. So we search for things, (and books) that are straightforward, direct, so we can grasp its concept easily. This is not the case. Oversimplified, obvious, almost offensive to one's intelligent, this book, that contains no new ideas or points of view, is one of the most overrated item I've seen in a long time. Please: do yourself a favour: for simple yet intelligent material, go somewhere else"
2,Who cares who moved my cheese?,"Half of this tiny book would make a very nice magazine article. The rest is redundant. It makes a good point in a cute way but if you're not aware that adaptability is essential in our changing world, then reading this book probably won't change anything."
1,Dharma stuff,"If we in the United States wish to understand the nature of impermanence, and the suffering that comes from our attachment to ""things,"" results, and outcomes, a better book will be Jack Kornfield's A Path with Heart. This book very keenly describes the basic dharma of Buddhism as it merges with psychology. Albert Einstein considered Buddhism the most appropriate religion for the modern era. Books about cheese and mice confuse what really should be a simple concept."
4,I Liked It! I Really LIKED It!,"I feel badly for all those reviewers who got no joy from this little book. Yes, there is nothing new here -- check up regularly to see if things are changing, embrace change, etc. etc. But I liked Michael's use (pg 85) of the characters to motivate his workers. I am imagining myself enjoying new cheese!"
2,To expensive for the kindle,I love this book and wanted to download it but this is way to expensive. I figured this would be a free book.
5,who moved my cheese,This book was recommended by a friend. It is such a simple message that I really enjoyed
4,CHEESE,I'M SO BUSY TRYING TO FIND MY CHEESE I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO REALLYSIT DOWN AND READ THE BOOK - I READ THIS BOOK YEARS AGO AND IT WASHELPFUL - COUNTING ON THE ASSISTANCE AGAIN - JOB DUTIES HAVE CHANGED -
3,The best place to start for a perspective on change,"This book will not change your life.But it is the first step to get you moving from a static view to a perspective that is ready for change.To simple for you? Take the next step - read Value Migration by Adrian Slywotzky, a book that is built around the same core concept - change - but takes an in depth look from at how patterns of change value has resulted in value changing hands in several industries.But you need to walk before you run. Pick this book up first and speed through it in half an hour. See if it gets your mind rolling."
4,It is helpful,Reviewed this book as part of a work book club. It prompted good discussions and it is helpful in providing effective metaphors for issues that arrive in organizations. We don't live in a static world and coping with change has to be the norm.
2,Sound advice... for ten year-olds!,This should really be a children's book. There is some basic advice here that isn't all bad but if you haven't learned it by the time you're 10 then you need serious help. It's appaling that this was a best seller BY ADULTS!!! Its even more amazing that businesses use this book as a discussion group to teach people how to work together. Why can't adults in the workplace just be told to do their job better? Instead we are suppossed to role play and relate to the over-simplified characters in this book so we don't offend anyone. Give me a break!!
2,This book is not very helpful!,"Not only am I in no ways closer to finding out who keeps moving my cheese, but this dang book doesn't give me any good ideas as to how to find out or what to do to detour people from taking my cheese! Not a very helpful book. It does not deliver what it sets out to do."
1,Who Stole My Cheese?,"1. This book is wrong. It teaches that you must accept change without regard to whether it is appropriate it not. It teaches that you must not struggle, you must not fight. You must simply accept whatever change happens. This is the perfect book to distribute when a company is going through reorganization.2. This book is inspirational. I mean inspirational in the sense that you can take a primitive and silly story, wrap some gibberish around it, bind it in hardcover and sell it for $20.3. This book is horrible and has almost absolutely no value. The only way you might find value in this book is if you have no sense of self. It could be called ""How to take a five-minute dinner story and turn it into a boring book.""4. There are two mice (or toolittlepeople) --- Spence Johnson and Ken Blanchard --- who stole my cheese. From my pocket.The only advice: please be careful. And save your money."
1,Corporate Mind Control for Peons,"Another corporate, mind control book written in elementary school fashion. This is a type of book that you earn after completing leadership classes. Gee, thanks. I'll display it proudly and flanked between the Kama Sutra and Green Eggs and Ham. Beware of Spencer Johnson, and Kenneth H. Blanchard . They are the devil."
1,A new low for the business world...,"This book has the most condecending and insulting message of any of the new religion in the business world books. It's an ""us verses they"" message that is conveyed in this book and only serves to further erode the morale of employees in the workplace. My office purchased 200 copies of this book and distributed them to each employee. We had meetings and discussions about this book and it's ""insights"" just prior to another reorganization. In essence they were telling us to keep our mouth shut and go with the flow, or get out."
1,Insult to your intelligence,"I have never written a review on Amazon before, but this book is so insulting, I can't resist. I was forced to read this where I work, and then they made us watch the cartoon in a Manager's meeting. That anyone with any common sense doesn't realize that this was the equivalent to reading Barney or the Tele-Tubbies needs to seek help. The author got filthy rich off of your willingness to be sucked into the PC World of Corporate America. This is what they think of you folks, that they can only really get to you if they communicate at this level. Be insulted; you should be.Terrible!Jmck"
1,Overrated,"This book has been considered a classic by many and used widely in the corporate world. In my opinion, however, if you are seriously considering reinventing yourself or improving how you manage life, this book won't get you there. Change doesn't come about with a superficial one-hour read. Consider a book like ""The Path of Least Resistance"" by Robert Fritz. It will take more time and effort, but I think it's a seminal work in the field of human motivational theory. If you give it a chance, it might transform you.Mario Alonso, Ph.D; author of ""Family Business Survival: Six Key Tasks Required for a Successful Family Business"" www.AlonsoStrategyConsulting.com"
1,"Cheesy, full of holes, and stinks like gorgonzola","A short parable about adapting to the inevitable need for change. The two mice in the story instinctively go off and look for new cheese when the old cheese is no longer supplied. Of the 2 humans, one eventually moves on and the other stays put. This takes up the middle 3rd of the book.The other 2/3rds deal with either with people at a class reunion or the author himself saying how wonderful and moving the parable is. Groan - this is just the author marketing the book to the reader trying to convince them to buy copies for their friends or use it in corporate training.Spencer co-authored ""The One Minute Manager"". Need I say more? Make an executive decision and give this one a pass."
5,A quick easy read for Juniors in High School,"A small book with a big concept. The author provides an appropriate analogy for one of our most typical human shortcomings, our resistance to change.Similar to those Five Minute Manager books. Books like these should be on all the reading lists for high school students to help prepare them for the challenges that will confront them in the workplace.A great gift for the graduate.Teen leadership"
1,Buy the Parody instead!,"This is the [weakest] book ever written! If your boss ever hands out this book, brush up your resume, because as Mason Brown says in his parody, ""Who Cut the Cheese?"" this book is used like a parting gift, a businessman's turtlewax.The key idea of blithely accepting change might just as well be summed up as ""resistance is futile!"" ..."
4,A good opener for closed minds,"A short story about 2 mice and 2 'little people' in a maze looking for cheese.Of course 'cheese' is just a metaphor for what you want in life (such as money, the ideal job), and the 'maze' represents where you are looking for what you want (such as your family, an organization). As the story goes, one of the characters (Haw) learns to deal with change successfully and writes what he has learned on the maze wall. In this way, the reader gets the main points in the book and can learn too how to deal with life's changes.A little book that is big on wisdom, many should find it entertaining and useful. Also recommended The Sixty-Second Motivator -another short story that is to the point and practical."
1,A Book About Nothing Novel,"""Who Moved My Cheese?"" is one of those classic books that tries to seem like it conveys a new, innovative idea while really just repeating an idea that most people have heard all their life. Advocating the common-sense idea that people have to prepare for and react to changes in their life, this story is a dull read, reinforcing ideas that readers have known for years before opening the covers of this narrative. I would not suggest that any reader spend his/her time looking at this book unless they have absolutely nothing else to do. Even then, it would be a waste of time."
1,"Why is there a ""for teens"" version? This IS for ""Teens""","This book has motivational value. Get on your feet and stop complaining, pick up your bootsraps blah blah blah stuff.I think people like it cause it can be read and finished while sitting on the toilet. Now they feel motivated cause they actually finished a book albeit a very silly one. I'll guess that's where the value of the book comes in. It has a large base of readers cause it's easy reading.Giving this book or recommending it should be contrued as an insult. This book is what you'd say to a friend who's down to try and encourage them to move on in life. ""Please don't kill yourself, there's a light at the end of the tunnel if you're willing to put on your running shoes...""Unless you're on the verge of alcoholism and despair and you're willing to give anything but religion a shot, I guess you can try this book. Otherwise just enjoy the quiet time on the porcelain."
4,Who Moved My Cheese?,"Who Moved My Cheese is a delightful allegory that will have long-lasting affects in both your business and personal life. The book is a quick read--about 45 minutes and is appropriate for all reading levels. The book has a well-written preface and three sections; the allegory is in the second section. Although you will benefit by reading just ""the story part,"" I encourage you to read every page of this book, for it is the first and third section that frame the story and make it memorable. I also encourage you to read this book with someone else. Discussions identifying which character represents you and others in your companay and life are where the gold lies. Whether you incorporate this in your company training, or use this in your personal life, this is a delightfully thoughtful book that will be great as resource."
2,Not worth the price I paid - very few insights,"There is nothing new that has not been said before. Because of it's fairy-tale-like tone, this book may be beneficial for the ""younger set"", and my spouse and I, both professionals, were trying to find the reasons why this simplistic book has become a business ""must read."" We're still stumped. We agreed that there was probably one good discussion point from the book, and it certainly wasn't covered in the goofy discussion provided at the end. I suppose that since this book is on Business Week's list, the authors will not have to look too far for their ""green"" cheese."
2,duh,"The upside is that the book could be read cover to cover in 20 minutes. It's dismaying to think, however, that many people would find revelation in it. For people who've never had a sincere reflective moment and don't realize the danger of getting caught up in shallow dreams or complacency, then the book has value. What makes me shudder is to think that many people have lived such unreflective lives!"
5,Life Changing Cheese,"Reading this book has changed my life. It is so simple yet so profound. The author has taken mice and little people and turned them into icons. Anyone who is dealing with change, fear, relationships, success, or failure should read the book. It will take you 30 minutes to an hour to read. If you don't like it, you haven't lost much. If you like it, you'll realize that the time you spent will be well worth it and much more."
3,Common Sense At Best,"I read this book not knowing what to expect, I'd never even heard of it before. My husband got it for me as a gift. Anyway, it was interesting and entertaining enough to keep my attention, however it was predicatable and uninspiring to say the least. It was filled with common-sense metaphors that we can apply to our daily lives. At best, I can see myself perhaps using those metaphors in my day to day routines, and for that it was worth the [money], but not much more than that."
3,Clarifies stuff we already knew.,So it's true - we all already know this stuff anyway. But this does help in seeing what kind of people we are and how we react to change. I found the appendix that talks about the book more interesting than the book itself.
1,Who Buys this Cheese?,"Ok, I admit my header is a little harsh and tacky, but the cruel reality is this book is a terrible waste of your time. If you are seeking a short story with a dubious message, this book might be of value to you. If you are looking for life changing inspiration and guidance, this book will be a sorry disappointment.I am in the habit of reading any self help book I can find that promises something new and profound in the hopes that even the smallest nugget of new information makes it all worthwhile. In Who Moved My Cheese, I found nothing of the sort. Perhaps most disappointing is that this book gives the feeling you are merely reading a retread of a mere fable with a message that is questionable at best. I wholly recommend not wasting a moment with this book."
5,"Profound, encouraging, entertaining","This book is entertaining and guides the reader skillfully through the process of fearless change. Changes in the workplace, at home, in relationships, and so on. We're afraid of change, afraid of making decisions which could produce change. The author of this book explains in a good-old-friend like manner that we don't need to be afraid of changes. It's a comforting read and I would call it a stress-relief guide. Another book that I greatly appreciated in this regard, which is also extremely helpful is Dietmar Scherf's ""I Love Me: Avoiding & Overcoming Depression."""
1,propoganda,"I saw some of the other reviews and then read this book. It is clearly blatant corporate propoganda to be used to manipulate workers to accept whatever the ""Borg"" deems fit. If you really want a simple good book on the Taoist philosophy of change read ""The Tao of Pooh"". I work in hitech cubeyland and am fed a continious stream of this dribble. It reminds me of the resistance in Orwell's ""1984"" that we learn was actually controlled by Big Brother. If you really want to see something good on corporatism check the video ""Rollerball"" out. The purpose of this book is DARK AND EVIL. This marks the death of the individual. Long live corporatism! Jonathan Jonathan Jonathan!"
2,Not A Lot To It,"After hearing from people how this book changed their life, and how people are more successful after reading this book, I decided to give it a go. However, I was let down. It is a drawn out story about some mice, and how they deal when their cheese isn't where they expected to find it. In so many words, you control your own destiny, you need to take charge, you need to stop blaming others when there are obsticles in your life, and you should never feel defeated. This book is a very quick read, with large print, and it is easy to follow, so it has that going for it. But I didn't really get anything out of it that wasn't already common sense. It is easy to know how to deal with conflict and obsticles in your life, but this book doesn't make acting on that knowledge any easier."
4,Nice!!,"This book is really great! Recently I have read a bookPersonal Best - How Ordinary People Achieve Extraordinary Success and How You Can Toowhich is very similar to this one. This book will teach you how to make your life more easier. Actually we do a lot of works in our day to day life. Sometimes we really get stressed out. If you read this book, you will get idea about how you can lead a happy and stress free life. I think everyone should read this book. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
2,Pricey,"This book has only 94 pages (in large font), and it's so expensive. It's like going to an expensive mediocre restaurant: The food's OK, but overpriced and overhyped. (And where's the beef?)The message is nice, cute, simple and easy to read. It's more like a pamphlet than a book actually, the kind that you would read at the waiting room of a doctor's office. It deals with how to handle change in our lives and in our fast-paced everchanging world, and the author creates a parody of how 4 different personalities react to change. The ideas were presented clearly, and the analogy is brilliant. It was a fun read, but I guess I just felt a bit [cheated] by the publishing company."
1,Reccomended to 2nd graders,"I was told this book was great, changed people's lives, etc... So I went into it excited to learn. However, I quickly, and I mean quickly, was bored with this book. It is written on a 2nd grade level, and tries to teach lessons that only a 2nd grader would find enlightening.There are so many things wrong with this book, I don't have the time, or inclination to highlight them. Especially annoying is the forewood which states that if you don't like this book (the story), that if you don't find the stories enlightening, that you are somehow missing it, and not able to realize the value of the book. I think the author should get off his high horse, and give some credit to his readers. It is certainly possible, if not prevalent, that people already understand and live by the ""lessons"" this book tries to impart."
1,"The cheese is ""tainted""!","A former employer of mine gave us all a copy of the best-selling book, telling us that after reading it, our productivity and attitude would increase tenfold.So, I, like all the others, read it. Like many on this site, I found the ""revelations"" to be trite, repetitive, and an insult to me as an adult.The only thing that the book tells me is that we Americans are suckers for any self-help guru with an ""idea"" destined to improve our believed-to-be mundane lives."
1,Forget mice...it's about lambs,"The easy adaptability advocated by this book may be convenient to the purposes of corporations, but it reminds me of a line from a Leonard Cohen song: ""Oh take me to the slaughterhouse, I will wait there with the lambs."""
2,Watch your employees move their own cheese!,"I would not recommend corporations supplying this book to their employees. After we were given our copy, many employees ""saw the handwriting on the wall"" and ""looked for their cheese"" - in a new organization. It was a horrible book to give people after a massive reorganization."
1,What is this?,"As other reviewers have noted, this is merely a modern fairy tale for your modern workplace - nothing here except another empty best seller to fill the void between chatting with your freinds and playing online golf at work. How this book is supposed to help those who are ""stuck"" in their job is beyond me, motivation couldn't come from this paperback fluff - especially if you are not already prepared. And if you are already there, then spend your money on a book which actually helps you get where you want to go, like ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" Yeah, this little thing is short, but why waste your money? This book's cost of $12 is hardly justified, either. I couldn't believe the list price of $19.95, at least they dropped it down some. Anyways, I've ranted enough, but please don't buy into the hype - I read another person's copy just to see what it was all about, and was truly disappointed that this had become such a bestseller."
5,must read,This is a must read often book for the ever changing world in which we live. This helps me focus on the positive of change and to better cope with change. I have recomended this book to all my co workers.
3,Change in the rapid environment,"Reading the book ""Who moved my cheese?"" make me reflect on my situation in the working place...it's good to know how i am so slow to response to the world...and it also make me to know ""What matter most"" in my life in react to the changing world...."
4,Simple but worth the time!,"This is a wonderful, simple book that is full of ""Life's lessons"". Yes it is a simple parable but it helps us to see another way of looking at a situation that could be difficult...change. Sometimes it was a bit predictable but it is light and fun and could help someone move out of immobility and into a proactive place in his/her own life. It was recommended to me and I am glad she did. I gave it a 4 because it seems a bit expensive."
1,INANE GARBAGE,"This is easily the worst book I have ever read. It talks to the readers as if they are idiots. The authors take the same old worn out subject of change and how it can benefit you if you are willing to recognize it and move with it, taking risks if necessary. This is an incredibly simplistic attempt to condemn the individual for not fulfilling their dreams or ambitions, when in the real world our society is a complex system in which all can not possible success, personally or professionally. That is evident in the control that 1 percent of the population who owns 90 percent of the wealth has. This book at the least is childish at the worst a blatant attempt to sell the reader on the flawed American Horatio Alger line, which is unobtainable for most people."
1,You don't need a book to tell you this,"These concepts are not new. To anyone thinking of purchasing this book, set out a half-hour of an evening to think about change, instead of taking that time to read this book. Plus, you can probably infer what the author is going to write. Johnson shows the ""revolutionary"" new concept that you have to adapt to change...does anyone else find this funny (adapt and change mean the same thing)? Don't waste your money on a book that takes a large amount of time to tell you what your subconcious can do on its own."
3,See the handwriting on the wall!,"Don't hold on too tight because change is always on it's way. Whether we like it or not life is always in process and we have to move with it or die.How easy it is to be complacent about our life and not realize that yes, we can move on from our stage in life. We can be at a point in our life where things are going ""fantastic"" or ""lousy"" but one thing is for sure ""this too shall pass"".We can become responsible for bringing about the change or we can wait to just let things happen. I certainly don't want to let someone else move my cheese, I'm too much of a control type to have someone decide my fate.Spencer Johnson in his audio Who Moved My Cheese, tells the parable of 4 characters who are caught in unexpected change, this experience forces them to deal with their outlook on themselves and on life.No one can make us change. How we would love to change others instead of looking within. This would be the easy way out. ""To thy own self be true""."
1,Where did I put my resume?,"If you don't ""swallow"" this inane, paternalistic, Orwellian crap, you must be resistant to change. In other words, ""Are you still beating your wife?"""
1,Insipid Book Only a Corporate Manager Could Love,"Several people I know have been given this book by the companies they work for. Fortunately, I work for a small firm where the managers are also active employees. They don't do ""management"" type things that must be taught in MBA programs. So I borrowed the book and read it and would now like to get the time back that I wasted doing so. This book is incredibly simple, offering slogans rather than any new ideas, and it makes assumptions that all people are alike. Not only should you not read the book, if your company gives it to you, you should probably begin looking for a new job."
2,Big Surprise - my boss made me read it.,"Admittedly, I approached this book with suspicion, since I have found the ""One Minute Manager"" to be one of the most idiotic and dehumanizing approaches to leadership in my lifetime. However, since my boss decided everyone in my department should read this book (which was deposited impersonally in my mailbox), I dutifully gave up a lunch hour and did so.Bosses: note what goes through the employees' heads.1. Is this really the reading level of the average American? Or just my boss? 2. Maybe my boss is trying to tell me something. Guess I'll call back that interview offer after all.In other words, I would not recommend giving this book to any adaptible, intelligent employees whom you wish to keep. And I doubt it will affect the sheep in any way whatsoever.To individuals who want to know what the fuss is about, you'd probably better read it just so you don't look uninformed. Try your library. It's not like you need to read it more than once."
1,LIKE EATING MOLDY KRAFT MACARONI,"I'm so glad others out there despise this book as much as I. It was given to all employees at my company a month before we were told no one was getting an annual bonus this year. (Coincidence? I think not.) Our CEO claimed it was the best thing he's ever read. Ever feel like you work for an idiot? This book is downright demoralizing and depressing when it's given to you by a company you slave 8-5 for everyday. They must think we have the intelligence of bridge trolls. I hated the message of this book so much, and the condescending stupidity it connotates that I actually burned it at a keg party the following weekend. The scary part? IT WOULDN'T BURN! We had to set it on fire so many times we gave up and threw it in the trash. The one positive was that after reading it I felt smarter than our management team and know now that someday, all the people who hate this book will come together to crush the cheese lovers. Oh yeah."
3,My new daily affirmation!,"Who moved the cheese, indeed! The idea that one can change one's life in an hour by reading this charming little rodent-ridden parable is enchanting. It gives me a whole new lease on life and helped me make an important decision: cheese is quite edible. I can eat it here or there, in a car, in a boat, with a stranger on a moat. I simply cannot believe that my life has changed so drastically all from the one hour that is required from reading this book! An added bonus: the author's simplistic writing style did not require me to look up a single word, saving me even more time. Oh, if only all of life could be summed up so easily using metaphors of dairy products and household pests. Then, I dare say, we would all be eating quite a bit of cheese, wouldn't we!"
2,I was disappointed...,"My 2 cents is that this book costs a lot of money for what I got out of it. I read this in one sitting and it did not ""change my life"". It was somewhat helpful in reminding me about attitudes and actions, but I think I could have found a less sappy and ""cheesy"" reading to get the same point across."
1,Boring!!!,I had to read this book because it was gifted to me by a good friend...but OMG...it was a torture...I tried to read it during my long train rides and i was like..Zzzz......better take a nap than reading this book..I have a good appetite for reading but this was just useless book...
1,The cheese stinks!,"I can't believe this was a #1 bestseller. The book is only 94 pages long, which is probably more like 50 something, cause every other page has a picture of a piece of cheese with some message on it. Plus the words are like 50 times bigger than a normal book - I felt like I was reading a kindergarten book. It is the most basic concept in the world. In my opinion, this book is for people who REALLY have a problem adapting to change and are very negative. On to PowerNomics."
1,If I could give no stars I would,"I was forced to read this book by my employer who apparently saw this book as a was to influence us toward a more positive environment in the workplace. It was insulting! I am a college educated professional. I don't need a ""cute"" story about mice and little people and vanishing cheese to help me accept change. Change is hard for everyone, especially if it is constant. If you wnat me to be positive in the workplace, treat me with respect. If you are looking a cute fairy tale, this might be for you. If you want a way to make positive changes in the workplace, look somewhere else."
1,Life Changes; Get over it!,"I read this book as a recommendation from one of our demented book club members (don't ask!). Since it was booked up at the library, I had to cough up the cash to purchase it, and $12 was a lot of money for a book that is only a few pages long, half of the pages filled with ""cheesy"" (pardon the pun) drawings, and the other half filled with a story in a font size large enough for the sight-impared. In other words, the whole thing could have been type-written on two pages! And here's the message: Life Changes--if you don't change with it, you'll get left out. Now you've just saved yourself a whole lot of time and money. Don't waste it on this."
1,Dumbing Down,"Intrigued by the title, I picked up this book at a friend's house and settled down for a short, but inspirational read. It wasn't long before I found myself skimming through the exploits of Hem and Haw. I'm all in favor of a simple approach, in fact I think a simple, straightforward approach has largely been lost in our sea of over-information. But self-help drivel does not a simple take make. This author does not receive more cheese in his bank account; we need to move to better cheese--and better analogies--that warrant our attention and fire our imagination."
1,This cheese smells!,"I read this book on a short plane ride.My husband had received it at his job like so many others had. It took me about an hour to read, only because I had trouble staying awake. Maybe I missed something but if anyone thought this book was innovative or unique in any way then they just don't read a lot. Two words I would use to describe this book would be trite and boring. Did anyone learn anything from this book that has not been told and said over and over again at least a million times before, and in a more engaging and thoughtful way? Not likely. Still after I saw the success this book had (weeks on the bestseller list, go figure) it made me wish I had written the book since by now I could have been happily retired in Hawaii somewhere."
1,My Cheese is in another Maze,"I, like many readers of this book received it from my employer. The company that I work for is restructuring. I had been in great debate about whether I needed to accept the changes or move on. After reading this ""book"" it was clear that I needed to move to another maze.The idea of working for someone who views his employees as either ""mice"" or ""little people"" sickens me. This book is the worse kind of manipulation. Preying on the weak, that are afraid to stand up for themselves.I must say that I got much more insight from the reviews of the book than from the book itself."
1,Cheesy - Don't waste your money or time with this book,"I really regret buying this book. I thought I would find something really different, a nice story about change in a pleasant format... A 10-year-old could write this one. Not even the ""real life"" examples at the end are good. Really frustrating. As many other readers found out, it was a big waste of time and money."
3,Fun but not particularly insightful,"This was a fun little allegory. For the price, I would have preferred something a little more substantial.I find it very difficult to believe the claim at the front of this book that this allegory has changed people's lives. The message is simple and obvious."
2,Just borrow someone's copy,"""Who Moved My Cheese"" deals with one of the most important topics in today's business world, but I'm afraid it does more harm than good because of the lightweight nature. While the message that change happens and we must be flexible enough to respond is good, the book offers little guidance on actually doing it.This book is likely to fall into the hands of executives because it's a quick read, but will likely leave them thinking that just telling people they have to change is sufficient. As someone trained in change management, I can assure you that is very far from the truth. Getting people to change successfully is much more difficult than decreeing it be so.I would recommend this book as a light-hearted introduction to the world of change, but would definately follow it with another of more substance. I'd recommend ""Sacred Cows Make the Best Burgers"" by Kreigel much more than ""Who Moved My Cheese""."
3,Good information at the core of a long tiresome metaphor,"""Who Moved My Cheese?"" is a fairy tale that contains useful insights into change. The author, however, takes a cute metaphor (mice and littlepeople in a maze representing different types of folks in life situations) and drags on and on. What should have been a perfectly adequate 10 to 20 page story has been teased into 90 pages with 10 or 20 pages of real content. However, I recommend it regardless."
2,Buy it used. Don't pay to much. Not worth it.,"Read this book as part a ""company change program"". The book is very basic and easy to read. The ideas of this book are simple and should be already common in living. Another Self-Help book that reminds you of things you already know. Might be a good refresher type book. Easily read in a couple of hours."
1,removed last sentence. It was a review on promoters and not the book.,"When I started my current job I was given a copy of this ""book"". Sorry, a short collection of simplistic sentences strung together to make me think that what ever comes my way is good and should be accepted with open arms but without thought, does not a great book make.Why do we even need a book like this, have we been dumbed down to the point that we need a book to tell us how to deal with change? This is nothing more than corporate America's answer to Mao's little red book. It saddens me to know that my country is being taken over by money hungry individuals who worship at the alter of capitalism and are convinced that an individual's true value is only equal to the sum of their assets."
1,There is nothing like a good parable...,"and this is nothing like a good parable. This was too contrived to be good, and very disappointing. Very silly and not all that well-written. Parables are inspired, this read as if the author spent too much time making the obvious complicated!"
2,There's nothing amazing about this book...,"In my quest for another motivational work, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, I ran across Who Moved My Cheese? When I picked it up, and found out that the company I worked for used this book, I figured it would be worth reading...Boy was I wrong!Although the point of the story was simple enough, the truth is the company that I work for simply changes too much...One minute, one group is handling some business function, the next they're doing something else...It gets aggravating trying to keep up with the flavors of the week in the business world...And it becomes particularly demoralizing when you witness friends being let go, because a leader in the industry made some bad business decisions...The only good thing about this book is its length...Could you imagine actually having to swallow 200+ pages of this bunk?"
2,Cute but little substance.,"It is a cute but simplistic story about two rats who like cheese. I can summarize its message simply:1. If you aren't getting what you want, do something to get it.2. If you currently have what you want, get ready to lose it.It is the age old ethic of ""look out for #1"" told in a style appropriate for all but the most illiterate. Amusingly, a copy of this book was given to everyone in our company just prior to a massive downsizing, outsourcing, and layoff program. It is a quick read, a bit patronizing and juvenile, and lacking in practical ideas or suggestions. This is a book to give to someone who needs to get off their backside and do something about their miserable life. Just don't expect it to make much of a difference."
3,So-so,"The message is good, but it's put forth a little too childlike. Had it been written in a style more suited for adult reading skills, I think it'd be more beneficial to people. I can see why so many have been turned off by this. But remember the bottom line here. Change happens, learn to deal with it.Also recommended - NO ONE'S EVEN BLEEDING"
2,So simple that you don't need this book,"The main themes are so simple that if you truly need this book to get the idea, then you aren't going to succeed anyway.Basically, change happens; take advantage of the new stuff and trends and directions; fighting all change is futile; and don't live with your head in the sand.There was absolutely nothing new here. But I am sure that you can give you money to this author because he is following the new trend: Give the most absolute basics of common sense in book form and millions will buy it.I truly wish someone had written this review for me before I had purchased this. If you really are curious as to why this is a best seller: get it from your library."
3,Nothing novel.. browse it if you have 15 minutes,"The book reminded me of Orwell's Animal Farm from get go. Of course, it comes no where close to Orwell's excellent writing style and deep insights. On the other hand, Spencer peppers the story with philosophical notes, and in the process makes the whole book too didactic. Most of the thoughts in the book are known to people anyway, but actually executing some of the things like ""Change before change hits you"", ""Do the thing you would if you did not have fear"", etc. are the hard tasks."
1,Worst book since kindergarten,"Although I like management books, this book is absolutely crap.The story is childish, the message is weak.Do not buy it.There is only one advantage, you can finish it within two hours of reading."
2,Beware if this book is given to you at work!!,"I worked for a large food company that was (is) always in turmoil. When things were really looking bleak a couple of years ago the Vice President of Sales/Marketing gave everyone this book for Christmas. Six months later just about everyone in sales and marketing was gone - me included. My boss the Director of Marketing read it the night it was given to him and said it was insightful but he wondered about the message and his job. Yep he got canned too! I admit I never read it. I knew my cheese was about to get moved already. My wife read it and said it was ""interesting"" and then suggested I start looking for a job. I guess the only saving grace of my story and this book is that somebody moved the cheese on the Vice President of Sales/Marketing as well. I hope he kept a copy for himself as he had plenty of time on his hands to read it!"
2,Pricey,"This book has only 94 pages (in large font), and it's so expensive. It's like going to an expensive mediocre restaurant: The food's OK, but overpriced and overhyped. (And where's the beef?)The message is nice, cute, simple and easy to read. It's more like a pamphlet than a book actually, the kind that you would read at the waiting room of a doctor's office. It deals with how to handle change in our lives and in our fast-paced everchanging world, and the author creates a parody of how 4 different personalities react to change. The ideas were presented clearly, and the analogy is brilliant. It was a fun read, but I guess I just felt a bit ripped-off by the publishing company."
5,Excellent - Great way to relate to the real world.,"I lead a retail sales team of 6 individuals and have fallen in love with this book. Our company has recently under gone serious change from the CEO to all executive management. The change is all over the place and the seriousness of separating the men from the boys is in place. This book was introduced to me by this same team as a line in the sand of you need to be in our boat looking for new cheese or your new cheese is with a different company.Excellent read, especially if you are experiencing difficulties at work and need assistance understanding the why."
4,"A simple book, but more than just simplistic!","Certainly change is a difficult subject for most people.Building a certain life and lifestyle takes alot of work and effort. So, when change is forced uponus - and eventually it is - most resist.This book, about life in the maze looking for newcheese, is a collection of simple truths to deal with whenchange come knocking.Certainly simple truths worth remembering in order to find this new cheese - whatever cheese is!I didn't find the book simplistic - on the contrary, I think there is a value in presenting simple truths - simple?!-Simon"
5,Real mind opener,"A fantastic book, will help to realize about the present situation about our job/profession, and really help to plan your life."
1,Not worth it,"Was forced to read this book, and watch the video, at work. Quite depressing how low an opinion of other people's intelligence the author has. I don't think that the book could be dumbed down any further. All in all, I found it quite worthless. All it's points were common sense anyways!"
1,An ineffective agent of change,"Change is an inevitable part of life, most of us know this. I'm sure no one would ""Hem"" and ""Haw"" about the ""change"" that occurs should you win the Mega-Millions Jackpot. Yet these same folks are apprehensive when the boss calls an all-hands meeting to discuss the ""new changes at work"" that will go into effect immediately!. Reality?, perception?, imagined?,.....sadly this book uses juvenile examples that are rather silly and never really gets to the heart of 'change', but for millions of folks, it is somehow good enough. :-("
4,Relevant to staff motivation training,Helped identify the means that people anticipate and deal with change. Helpful in personal as well as in work situations.
4,a step back - good plane ride material,"This is a short, simple book, but that lets go through a bit of self-reflection, trying to figure out what your 'cheese' is. If I read it again, I'd probably have a new 'cheese'."
2,Good - on one topic,"A nice simple read but this book is being recommended a bit too strongly for what it can really deliver. I got the message about 1/4 of the way through the book. I felt beaten over the head by the time I got to the end. Also, there's much more to managing change than what is described here and unfortunately some people I see reading it come away feeling more capable to manage change than they truly are."
3,... shared wisdom ...,"I read this book in 40 minutes -- 20 minutes on the bus on the way to work, 20 minutes on the way back. The little mouse story is cute, and the author makes a lot of sense, but all you really find out is that you need to look at yourself and think about what you will have to do when everything you count on changes.Here's the author's cheat sheet summarizing the book -- for free!:* change happens * anticipate change * monitor change * adapt to change quickly * change * enjoy change* be ready to quickly change again and againSome good lessons, great marketing, and a lot of hype. Wait for the paperback."
5,Who moved my cheese,"I received the book very quickly, I needed it for school and got it in time. It was like new if not new."
2,Littlepeople and Mice,I am somewhat interested by the characters in this book. A quick read that tells a story about human reluctance to change.
2,Very minimally entertaining...,"The only good things that I found with this book were (1.) For a very anxious person like myself, the book attempts to show how silly anxiety regarding change can be and (2.) The book is very short, therefore there is no reason why people shouldn't read this book and judge for themselves if they like it or not...On the other hand, the content of the book is quite simplistic and the point that it is trying to make is no different than the advice that any friend would give you when going through a trying situation; for example, losing a job, going through a tough break-up, etc. There is always ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and ""no door ever closes without another one opening."" This is the type of advice that you can get from a friend that would serve the same purpose that this book serves. I cannot rate this book higher than two stars."
2,used for corporate oppression,"this is a great book if you are trying to keep your employees from complaining....often given out when a company is about to shut down, or lay off employees, to inspire them to look for other jobs so they dont have to pay them unemployment benefits....shipping took 3 weeks....glad i only paid 53 cents for it...."
4,Easy to Understand,"This book is great for many reasons, but I will point out the one that sticks out to me: ""Easy to understand"" This book will give any manager an idea of what to do with different personality types who they have to manage. While this is not an in-depth study of what to do with ever nuance employees may have, this book points out obvious things managers can do to get more productivity out of their employees. This book also works for employees, it can help people better understand why they do what they do at work.In the same genre of ""First Break All The Rules,"" by Marcus Buckingham, this book pounds away at the fact that we are all different, and the more we know about ourselves, and our managers know about us, the happier, and most importantly, more effective everyone will be."
1,Not Sure What The Fuss Is All About,"I am personally a book lover and never think twice when buying a book, especially business related books. But this one,I have always been suspicious about. Then a few days ago, a friend lent it to me and I read it ! The message was simple, good and must be embraced. Since the message is obvious, we need a story to keep it alive in our minds, so Hem, Haw, Scurry and Sniff was created to act thier parts. But after reading it, especially after reading all the hype about it, you find it kind of a silly story and actually a little let down. BUT YOU MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER THE LESSONS IN THE STORY. Read it once."
4,"Simple, Easy To Read","I thought this book was quite good. I enjoyed the story itself and could see my self rather clearly in one of the characters. I thought the introduction was a bit long. I think the reason the this book is so widely appreciated is because the author knew that you have every spectrum of employee in your average company, from those with a Ph.D. all the way to those who did not graduate High School. In order to speak to a wide audience, you must put it into terms for everyone's consumption. This book may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think that change is a regular ingredient in our lives that we must come to grips with. How we react to change (which will always be occurring) can set the tone for our very temperament. Kudos to Dr. Johnson!"
5,Good Book,"The only thing we must remember at any given point of time is that that everything in life that happens has a definite reason and purpose, it's just that for some reasons known only to Him, we get to know about it only much later.I guess all we can do is do our best in the circumstances and never loose faith in ourselves, in our own abilities to face the daunting tasks and in the invincibility of the human spirit to take on the impossible without giving up.This is a book that I read recently, which I felt had a lot of interesting lessons put forth in an extremely simple manner. I gained a lot from this book, as I am sure you will too."
4,Wake up and smell the Coffee!,"Upon opening the pages of this slim volume I began to reveal the mystery of management and the details of interacting within core groups at work. In essense the four main characters are easlty recognized in the workplace and will be manifested in your fellow employees.The book is easy to follow but one that may be hard to actually put into play if your staff is unwilling to think outside the box. All too often those that read it will point to those around them as the ""hems"" and ""haws"" without realizing that several of their fingers are pointing back at themseles.It's not very profound reading; more so a staight foreward guidebook to becoming proactive instead of reactive.I recommend this work to new managers and old managers alike."
1,Amway ideology,"This book is full of cliche's. If you lack seriousness and shallow insight, this book is for you. Good ideas for making a cheap infomercial or an Amway (now Network Marketing and Quixtar)pep rally.The language lacks creativity. The tone sounds like it's a boss giving lip service to self motivate while thinking out loud or an HR trying to sound good to get promoted. Extremely predictable.Don't buy this book. It's a waste of money."
1,Very Disappointing,"I'm not a regular reader of ""self-help"" books, but I bought this one because I had heard it described as ""amazing"", and, frankly, because it sounded sort of fun, all of these little people and mice running around having life experiences inside of a maze. Also, it was very short, so I figured that even if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be making too much of a commitment. Now that I've read it, I wish I had my money back and I wish I had my time back. It's not insightful, it's obvious. It's not clever, it's patronizing. And the ""optional"" section at the end, where everybody sits around discussing how to apply to their own lives the lessons learned is downright painful."
1,Pablum for the masses -- avoid,"My firm recently distributed this book before revealing our new health plan that cut most of our benefits. The premise of the book is to convince you that things change, and it says that in about 15 different ways, and then tells you to accept change. Hardly an original thought between the two covers which are pretty close together. It's more like a pamphlet than a book. But it is being used as a tool by management to cow their herds into submission. I believe HR managers who use this sad excuse for presenting change should be ashamed of themselves (they should read ""empowering HR in the M&A process""); management that endorses it is lacking in communication skills (they should read Jack Welch's Battle Plan for Corporate Revolution) ; and intelligent readers who buy it will be embarassed that they succumbed to the hype (they should read anything else). ""The glass is half full"" -- I just saved you [money]."
1,Tremendously condescending,"This book is a tremendously condescending parable, bordering on propaganda, about how corporate America doesn't owe you a living. If the last ten years has failed to drum this reality into the American workforce, spending precious money on a badly written story about mice won't do it either. My manager handed these out as gifts one Christmas, which I thought was ironic and in poor taste (""here's a patronizing story likening capitalism to a rat maze, and you, to a rat. Enjoy!"") I suggest that everyone considering this book invest instead in one that elucidates the history of American labor, its founding ideals and modern day failures, and then ask themselves whether they agree with the message in ""Who Moved My Cheese"" (that being, our laziness and lack of creativity as workers solely determines our experience with economic misfortune in this country)."
1,Better left unread,"I wish my manager had saved his money and simply passed around one of the many inane heart warming ""true stories"" that get passed around the internet. This book is pop-psychology for the CEO-set. Inane and ultimately confusing, the book's ultimate ""theme"" doesn't hold up to even minute philosophical scrutiny. Once considered, its theme actually becomes ominous, and if I worked anywhere else I would be concerned for my job and would probably take it as a sign to look for better chesese. This book is insulting to the thoughtful person and to anyone who just so happens to have a strong belief system and doesn't need some M.D.-millionaire to tell us how to deal with our lives, let alone our managers."
5,Awesome,"Great book. Everyone should know the story of who moved my cheese. Should be taught early in life, and revisited again and again."
5,Highly motivating for whatever situation,"After this book was recommended to me by a colleague, since our company is going through a large bit of reorganization, I picked it up from amazon. What a fantastic motivtor! It is not, as one reviewer had stated, just for managers who see workers as sponges. In fact, that reviewer might need to deal with some change in his life. It is NOT about being downsized, it is about inevitable changes that just occur. We need to be perceptive to smaller changes now and adapt so that we can run for the ""cheese"" when the big change happens. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is facing change or doesn't even foresee it coming."
2,Trite and Silly,"This short, overpriced book states the obvious (""Change happens, go with it"") in a silly story. I loved ""The One Minute Manager"" but this book is not in the same league."
1,If you don't mind your intelligence being insulted...,"...then read this book. I was forced to read this at a former job, and never in my life have I been so insulted at work than by having to read this book. It's written on a third grade level, with big print and huge margins. It insults you with it's simplistic messages of what I consider to be common sense.The ""cheese"" represents motivation & goals, and the book explains how to regain / hold on to your motivation if someone, or something, has moved / removed your motivation. I would hope that any capable and competent adult would be able to understand how to do this without needing to be told it by a cheap and utterly useless book.The only thing great about this book is that it makes a great joke gift for that boss you absolutely hate.I'd suggest that instead of wasting your money on this book, give it to charity, or take your boss out to lunch and thank him / her for not making you read this book."
5,A Powerful Precept For Patient People!,"Although the author is very repetitive and seems to drag this short story on for longer than is necessary, it was a great book and I recommend it to anyone looking for advice on how to deal with change in their life.The only question I have left is:Does Haw get arrested for constant graffiti on the maze walls? ;)"
4,Not what you think but ok.,"Just finished this book, it tells a good lesson but I believe it is more meant for the child than maybe a grownup and working person.I admit this book does refresh that sense of get up and just do it feeling and the common sense that was already in you but really this book is better suited in the elementary school library.I will for sure be telling my kids this story one way or another."
4,ITS CHEESE!,"If your struggling in your job, don't want to move on after a break up, or just want a change in life and can't figure out what's so hard about it, this little story will get you over the hump. I already knew this but it's good to know how to explain it to others."
3,This book is all about change,"This book is written as a parable about mice in a maze and what they must do to be successful in finding cheese.One of the lessons is that when cheese is longer in the same place the mice must change where they go to look for the cheese. There are also little people in the maze that instead of changing and looking for cheese else where they just stay where the cheese use to be and complain. There are several good lessons to be learned from this book,it is simple and easy reading."
1,looking for answers?,"People are looking for answers to improve how they feel about their lives. This book is not the answer. You will learn more about human nature and empathy, and change by reading a hundred or so of the reviews of this tiny (tiny ideas too) book. Good Luck finding your answers to life's big questions."
3,Eh...,"I was required to read this book for a college course. ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" does teach some important life lessons about change, but I found the method the book used to get those lessons across (a parable about ""little people"" making their way through a maze) to be personally unappealing. The book's other saving grace (besides its message) is that it's a quick read - it has almost 100 pages, and the words appear in large type. I wouldn't read ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" again."
1,Don't Bother ...,"To me, this reads as a simplistic cliche.And the Mouse-Cheeze metaphor only distractsfurther from the book's transparent message.Don't know how this made it to best-sellercategory. Don't waste your time ..."
2,Don't waste your time or money on this one.,Nothing new offered in this book. The author thinks he's come up with a clever idea but the book is extremely shallow and non-applicable to the real world office or workplace. It reminded me of some ... seminars I have attended where some academic uses text book generalizations that have no pratical application.
2,The mice may abandon the ship!,I decided not to share this book with co-workers for fear they might take their cheese to a different employer!
4,Good book,"I found this book to be a good source of help for an employee of mine who has issues with depression. This book can be used as a good motivational tool by nearly anyone, anytime, anywhere. I also recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold."
2,Why work at all?,"After reading this book (which took about 10 minutes), I wondered why I still work for a living when you can make millions of dollars writing simple books for simple people. It amazes me still how these things (this book, the One Minute Manager, etc.) become cult classics in the business world. While giving a cute story to illustrate human reactions to change, the serious reader interested in change management/grief process should read Elizabeth Kubler-Ross and Viktor Frankl."
3,Simple but potent message,"""Who Moved My Cheese"" is a simple book with a powerful message about change. Personally I did like the book, but I feel the author did not reinforce his points enough or give enough examples. Many people have written about this same subject, and I do not think this book has anything remarkable to recommend itself. The only unique thing I can think about is the fact that the book was written as a parable using mice and cheese. If you have twenty minutes go ahead and read the book, but I cannot recommend adding this to your personal library."
4,VERY INSPIRATIONAL,"Who Moved My Cheese is a very inspirational book for anyone who if faced with an unexpected change in their life. It makes you look at your life alot differently. Are you settling for what is comfortable(old stale cheese), or are you able to move on, accept change, and find fresh new cheese. Are you a ""Scurry & Sniff"", or a ""Hem & Haw"" ? Confused? Read the book and you'll be able to answer that question. Very easy read!"
1,Only book that I have ever returned.,"This book left me saying, ""IS THAT IT""! My first error in buying a book without reading the reviews first. I assumed it was going to be something great! I was wrong! I think alot of people made the same mistake as I did, much to the delite of the author.The reason the book has sold so well can be summed up in four words, ""The One Minute Manager"".""PURSUE, ADAPT AND OVERCOME"", I think I learned this more from an old Clint Eastwood movie.Save Your Money!"
1,Marketing Magic,"American Marketing is a psychological wonder. How to get people to buy a service or product is no longer based on the quality of the service or product but rather on the strategic format of the presentation.This book was sold on its references to the former success of its author. However, as meaningful as the objective of this book was in relaying the message of adjusting to life's changes, the means to do this reached a level no higher than that found in a junior high school beginning writing course. My opinion is that had I spent $2.00 on this book, it still would have been a waste of my money."
3,"""Don't cry over spilled milk, wipe it up and pour another""","-- that's the jist of this book. If you need to presentsomeone with [an inexpensive] object lesson, then this book may be for you. Ifyou think you already know that, then this book may still be for you.If you already adapt well to change without griping over it and are able to smile the whole time, then you don't need to read this book. It reads simply and quickly, and the lesson is an easy one to know, but perhaps harder to understand and incorporate into our daily lives."
4,Stuck in a Rut????,"About an hour's read, this book simplifies how a person can view and react to change in a complex world. Where I work, our department recently reorganized and even though I was placed in a different area, it was no big deal as what's the use of spending energy complaining when I may be able to have a new beginning and change the course of my vocational future. Yes, many of us feel we have no control over the decisions made by corporate management (the Big Cheese so to speak), but does it really matter? Unless management is corrupt (Enron), then why fight for a cause (stopping change) when it's enevitable. In addition, the only constant in this world is ""change"" - - change is a part of evolution of the human race. Embrace it and make it a part of your world. It's painless really."
2,I don't know...,"So the point of the book is ""all things always change"".I knew that. I've always phrased it, ""adapt, migrate or die"", but okay, it's just a style thing.I didn't particularly like the book because it was a little simplistic and predictable for me. I can understand how some people could enjoy the metaphor of the mice and the cheese. I just already worked this out."
2,The Cheese Is Turning Blue,"Every week I look at the top ten best sellers. Every week I see Who Moved My Cheese on the list. This book just won't go away.The book is slim, not too long. It tells a simple story using animals for characters. Three blind mice. It tells what happens when you do not keep your eye on the cheese. Someone moves it.Two of the mice continue to visit the place where the cheese used to be hoping the cheese will come back. The third mouse looks for cheese in other places.What a [poor]story...The point is that every day you have to go to work and prove to yourself and to others that you deserve the job you have. Never take your job for granted..."
1,Wast of time,"This book is a waste of time. The authors should write a book about marketing such a poor product. That would be worth reading, but not this book. Some people think it is short, but it is actually really long. The whole book can be summarized in one frase: ""If you are down, GO FOR IT!""."
2,Pleeeeeze,"While learning about ways to change your viewpoints and search for new ways of experiencing life and reaching goals is a good thing, learning these principals by reading about fictitious humans and mice looking for food in a maze was not my cup of cheese. I'll stick to grown-up books, thank you."
4,On Moving and Cutting the Cheese . . .,"Reading this book can lead to the discovery of change. One's perception of change and progress can be renamed through this book alone. The hidden allegory unfolds from one chapter to the next, while at times the readers are left to wonder who's who in their own place of employment.I recommend this book for its thoughts on change and ""restructuring."" Should your boss recommend this book, should you yearn to rethink the world of work, should someone sneak it into your portfolio, take heed and divert your eyes to its pages for a critical reflection on your personal and professional journey."
1,Just work hard!,This book is a travesty lacking original content and thought. The fact that it is actually a bestseller makes me worry about the collective intelligence of Corporate America. Save your money and buy something else!
1,An insult to business professionals,"Yes, I got the positive message: look for ways to improve your situation and embrace change. I agree!! What I hate are the other messages found in this story: Every man for himself; when you find something good hoard it and don't tell anyone; don't think just run; follow your base animal instincts; give up on your friends; find cheese and forget finding water or anything else. We live in a world that demands simple well marketed answers to complex questions. This book fills that need."
5,Awesome book,"This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. At first one will think this is a childs book. However after completing this book you will began searching your deepest, enter thoughts as to who you are and where you are going in life. Great Book for the people who are simply living life as handed to you."
3,Interesting metaphor helps display common sense,"Who Moved My Cheese is a very effective teaching technique. While it is relatively short, this is actually a very good thing for many allowing you to read it in one sitting. The metaphors used in this book are memorable and succinct."
3,An easy read and lots to think about!,"My former profession was a mental health therapist and I loved to use fairy tales as a learning tool. A friend mentioned this title about dealing with change and thought I would have a look. It will give you another perspective on how people deal with change; won't uncover anything new and could be a good jump start to a discussion if a group of people are dealing with changes at work. My title has been passed on to another friend. Suggest you get a used copy,"
5,4 quadrants of Cheese - YOU,"The book was in excellent shape and the price waas fantastic!The book is easy to read and short but has lots of perspective as well as you can search yourself to see which of the 4 characters you most resemble.It gets you thinking about change and how well we as individuals deal with it and the lesson from that ""little"" person can be applied to ourselves that in some cases may lower your stress since there is now a category we can place ourselves in or a grade we can self evaluate ourselves to.Try it and you will be asking people in your life who you live and share space with...where did you move my cheese?"
3,"First we got chain-email, now chain-book","If you've read the reviews below, you probably noticed that people don't give very high ratings for this book. Then how come the book sells so well? I think it was Amazon's best selling book a few years back. The reason is because it uses the same strategy as those chain emails. It has a nice little idea that is packaged with a referral suggestion. You'd be surprised how many people will follow the suggestion and spread out the word. Companies are also suggested to buy books for their employees, and that means hundreds or thousands of books per purchase.Just like emails, it doesn't cost much to refer the book to other people. It doesn't cost a lot to buy the book neither. So I think that's how the book became so popular.Pesonally I don't hate the book as much as some people here. It's a nice parable that might be applicable to some instances of my life."
1,Who Moved The Cheese?,"Despite rave paid reviews, I read this book under pressure from the major company whose corporate symbol enjoys cheese on a regular basis. (I suspect the thousands of ""required"" readers from this empire resulted in this book's best seller status. ) The book is depressing for anyone who works toward a common team goal. The book implies that when things get bad, you should dump all previous behavior and try anything different. It also implies that those who fail in this practice are losers who can't ""handle change"". This book is over-priced and simple minded."
1,Would have made a nice greeting card,"Imagine a Hallmark card made into a book. What could have been said in a paragraph was made into a supposed ""must read"" business book.Yes, it is a point well taken, but I would not insult the employees I work with by asking them to read this book."
1,What the --- ? This book is retarded.,"Things in life change. You have to adapt and hold a positive attitude. Mutate, migrate, or die.If you've just read the first paragraph of this review, you need not buy this book. If you are thinking about buying this book, I assume you are a manager of some type. Don't buy this book. You will be disappointed. If you do buy this book and make your people read it, you are either a very poor manager or an idiot, or both.This book is so revolting, so poor, so uninspiring in any way possible, that I cannot give you an in-depth review, because even thinking about this book inspires fits of rage as I ponder how bad a leader one would have to be to actually think his or her employees could gain any type of inspiration from this book.The one good thing, if I have to give something, is some of the axioms printed in bold, big type on a few of the pages.-- JJ Timmins"
4,Fun & Eye Opener,"I had a great time reading Who Moved My Cheese. The style is fun and entertaining while delivering some excellent messages and insights. I could identify with the characters of the book: their resistance, fear of the unknown, and the discovery of New Cheese when I let go of all that. What I loved about this book is that it is simple, and anyone, from teenagers to senior citizens, no matter what they do in life, can read it and learn from it. Another book that I thought was an amazing eye opener and life changer for me and friends around me is Working On Yourself Doen't Work, by Ariel & Shya Kane, as well as their audio tape Magical Relationships. The Kanes make it easy for us to simply look at some mechanical behaviors without judging them, allowing for magic to happen in our --my life. I highly recommend their book and tapes."
1,Who Moved My Cheese? Even the title is a joke,"I read this book with an OPEN MIND, and after spending 20 bucks and reading this piece of trite garbage in half and hour, I felt like an idiot, no like someone who needs help changing. Sniff and Scurry are little mice, and Hem and Haw are two little people who are searching for cheese in a giant maze. It is supposed to teach us about how change is good, and how to cope with change, but it comes off as stupid. For a self-help book, you can't get anymore lame than this. You need help with change, huh? Start by removing this book from your shopping cart. There is no redeeming value here."
1,who moved my cheese,"this book reminds me of the emperor's new clothes. I think everybody is afraid to really state their true opinion, and therefore everyone sees the beautiful clothes. i could not believe that this book is a handout at big corporate meetings. to me this all couldv'e been said in one whole entire sentence. it's great for a third grade reading level. i am shocked how the whole society can be hooked on to this best seller."
1,Why would anyone read this book?,"The book can be summed up in a sentence:Be prepared for change and don't be closed minded.You might expect that the book will expand on this theme, but it doesn't. The first section portays a scenario in which some friends are hanging out together, talking about how their lives have changed. One friend mentions recalls a story called ""Who moved my cheese,"" and tells his friends how much he and everyone who knows it likes the story.The second section portrays two mice and two men in the story of ""who moved my cheese."" The moral of the story is as stated above.The final section returns to the group of friends, where they all agree that the story was wonderful and they all loved it.The print in this book is so large, that the 90-odd pages probably contain less than 1000 words. This is no more a book than a glorified essay. Caveat emptor."
1,Simplistic introspection,"After reading this book, I've decided that it is an extremely simplified segregation of what all of us feel inside at any given time in our lives. In fact, I had a hard time of hurdling the first flaw in the writing... the cheese is described as the consolidation of what one would want in my life, yet the entire book removes the power from the entity creating the cheese to say that the cheese can be molded and removed from someone's life. I don't buy that... scenarios change... my cheese preference remains the same. When the scenario changes is when I go elsewhere to find the fulfilling cheese. At any rate, this is mediocre at best."
1,this 'cheese' stinks,"I am so glad I borrowed this 'book' from the library instead of parting with my hard-earned cash. However, the eight - ten hours I spent reading it are 8 hours of my life that I'm never going to get back. The sooner the public gets wise to self-help claptrap like this (some self-help books are well written and helpful - not this one), then the sooner it can stop lining the pockets of jokers like Spencer Johnson."
3,"If you like to buy books, buy this book...","If you want to know what this book is about, but don't want to read it, I can sum the book up in five (5) words: ""Things change--get over it."" Thank you."
1,The problem is you're not seeing it from the cheese's point of view,"See, you have to think? Why does the cheese keep moving? The simple answer is that it doesn't want to be around these mice. From the cheese's point of view the mice are trying to destroy it, thus it has to keep moving in order to save itself. Let me try to relate it in a real world scenerio. This is a story I like to tell when I meet up with some old friends, after a high school reunion. I was given this book by my terrible boss, and told I had to read it. I did. A few days later my boss accused me of stealing one of the two copies of this book that had been bought for the entire store. But, brave readers, I took inspiration from the cheese and moved on: to another job.The end"
2,Cheese is for chumps,"This book is a truly great propaganda pamphlet for fat cats who like to play games and torture mice before they eat them. The book helped me realize how great it is to be able to manipulate other people, make them do all the work and all the changing, steal their cheese and then toss them this scrap of a book and say ""Deal with it."""
2,"thank you, duh!","Anyone unaware of the fact that the business world is changing and people must change with it, does not belong in business today. Frankly, I found the book simplistic to the point of being insulting."
1,"offensive, patronizing, condescending","I find little to redeem a book that portrays the average working stiff as a lazy rodent who mindlessly resists any changes sent down by the benificent philosopher-kings who only have the employee's best interests in mind. Perhaps employees prefer to have some say in the changes that are thrust upon them, perhaps they believe that the powers-that-be are not as all knowing or well-intentioned as the authors portray them. Personally, I'd recommend a good Dilbert book instead."
1,Moldy cheese and other horrors.,"The only cheese that I could find was moldy. This book is horrible. Badly written. Poor analogy. Boring story. No matter what anyone tells you, know that this book got into the top 10 because companies bought it. Not individuals. If you are some corporate big shot contemplating buying this book for your minions because their morale is poor, please know that this will only diminish any small vestiges of morale that they may have. Treat people like mice, and they will poop in your cupboard. If they are smart, they will find a way out of your god forsaken maze."
1,Sad commentary on us,"Someone sent me this book. I spent the hour it takes to read it immobile, in shock. Where have we come to that people actually spend $20 on extended Hallmark cards and rave that it has ""changed their lives?"" A clever man, this author, he's made a fortune out of our ignorance on the most basic issues. Sad. Sad. Sad. The book went out with the rubbish the same evening and I sent a polite thank you.What else can you do?"
1,Hated this book!,"This book was terrible! It proposes you must be always alert to changes, and change yourself. Nice fiction for those companies that love downsizing, but it destroys employee loyalty! To use the mouse theme, what about aging mice? You WANT to be safe and comfortable as you age and can't run as fast as the young, cheaper mice! Horrible book!"
2,Not what I had hoped,"While valid, all of the points made were easily anticipated and had it been printed on 8.5 x 11 paper in 12 point type, would have fit easily on two pages.I could have written a better book. Luckily, I got it for next to nothing so I didn't overpay by much."
5,Dynamite Reading!,"""Who Moved My Cheese?"" gets to the crux of one of people's most innermost fears--Fear of Change. Don't be fooled by the book's simplistic look because the pages are filled with powerful thoughts and ideas. This is a definite read for those wanting to make a difference and move up a few notches. The two key ideas from this book are: 1. Don't ask ""What Will Happen if We Change?"" Ask ""What Will Happen if We Don't Change?"" 2. Don't ask ""Why?"" Ask ""Why Not?"""
1,Tripe,"Valuable only for the feeble minded. Another opus from the 1-minute thinker. Far better is the book ""Who Cut my Cheese"" by Stilton Jarlsberg. This latter book (a parody) provides far more useful and realistic advice than the book by Johnson. Plus, it is a much more enjoyable read."
1,Absolutely nothing new,"Our beliefs control our actions. Embrace change rather than fear it. Face our fears, don't hide from them. Use visualization to help achieve our goals. If you've just read these 4 sentences, then save your money because you've pretty much just read the book. The concepts in this book are so simplistic as to be useless. While I generally don't disagree with the points the author makes, it is hard for me to believe that there is an adult anywhere who isn't already familiar with them. This book might be a good way to teach these principles to a child, but for a business person, it is insulting to the intelligence"
1,You can't be serious,"I honestly cannot believe people actually proclaim this the ""best book I have ever read"". It's possible the book is better than the audio CD, but I highly doubt it.This entire book is an anectdote that is far from moving, insightful, or motivating. I found absolutely NO value in this story."
1,Rumor has it...,"...that the reason this book is a best-seller is that companies about to lay off lots of people are buying it in bulk to distribute to those on the way out, in the hope that it'll brainwash them to the extent that they won't go postal and return to their erstwhile workplace with AK-47s.Sounds likely to me."
2,Cheese sandwich,"This ponderous, pretentious collection of dime-store wisdom is enough to prompt the question, on what day did the Lord create ""Who Moved My Cheese?"", and couldn't he have rested on that day, too?"
3,Easy to read,I think the story is quite simple and yet it means a lot ofthings. It encourages people to overcome fear and achieve their goals.
4,Do you have the guts?,This audio version of the book is a great story and one people can use to hold up as a mirror to their own lives. Being able to adapt to change is so important and the authors do an excellent job of illustrating the various dynamics of change. This book will definitely locate YOU.
1,Worse than religion,"I can't believe my mother in law thought this piece of tripe was a good book. I guess if you are mentally retarded and like simple ideas with blatant attemps to sell itself, then this book is for you. This book has one simple idea that can be said in one sentence. Here it is for free: Things change; deal with it!Plus the book goes on and on about how you should buy copies and give it to other people. It is worse than religion."
3,read it before your boss does,"I've noticed this book for some time but never felt the urge to read it until this week. A friend called me up and said that her boss had given everyone in her department a copy. Uh oh. Sure enough 2 out of the 5 folks were fired.Who Moved My Cheese is a precious little fable ( I don't mean this in a good way) about lab mice and wee gnome like folk. It teaches the pefectly true lesson that life is about change. You do not own your job, your employer does and one day your job (the cheese and the lifestyle it supports) can vanish over night. Instead of crying get with the program and find more cheese. This is truth but it's presented in such an annoying, and patronizing way that I really hated the book.I can only assume that the author thought he was writing for idiots."
1,Cheesy,"To help calm employee responses to layoffs, the authors present a parable about mice and men asserting that independent reflection betokens bad character.Compare this with the following credo: ""You see the ox, comrades, admire him! He eats where we command him to eat. If we let him graze on this field, he eats. If we take him to another field where there is not enough grass, he grazes all the same. He cannot move about, he is supervised. When we tell him to pull the plough, he pulls it."" Pin Yathay, in his memoire about the starvation of his family in Khmer Rouge camps (""Stay Alive, My Son"", available on Amazon.com), quotes this as ""an often-heard Khmer Rouge parable.""Layoffs are inevitable and they produce anxiety, but the authors' response in ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" raises more problems than it settles. The book's main virtue lies in having sparked several parodies that contain some good laughs."
2,Incomplete story,"I found this book to be a disappointment primarily because it left out the answer to an important question, ""Why is this cheese being moved so much?"" While it does address, in a humorous way, the basic characters we find within all organizations who resist change no matter what, those who are quick to adapt to change, etc., it leaves out the motivation of the ""cheese mover"", who seemingly moves the cheese frequently, without planning,logic or explanation. Consequently, the message I received from this book was that the best employees are those who go along with ""moving the cheese"" in a robotic, unquestioning way. I am dissapointed that this comes from such a recognized author and it runs counter to good management philosophy."
5,Helpful,"I learned a lot from this book which I purchased as a gift for my mother. I read it myself and I was amazed at how much of the information was applicable. I have recently returned, from the Marine Corps, to my accounting job. It was quite a change, needless to say. This book has helped me adapt and accept the new enviroment. It can help you in life, work or just to help with your goals. It only takes about an hour to read."
3,"Worth Reading to prep for ""Who Cut the Cheese""","""Who Moved My Cheese?"" is more than a book - it's a phenomenon. For some people, it changes lives. For others - it's a bit hard to take seriously. For BOTH of those groups, I recommend checking out the definitive parody ""Who Cut the Cheese?"" by Stilton Jarlsberg MD (Crown Publishing - be sure to check the author's name, as there's a book about ""gas"" with the same name).The two books coexist happily on my book shelf: I read ""Moved"" when I need a little jumpstart in my motivation, and I read ""Cut"" when I just need a laugh to take some of the stress off. Together, they make an effective team!"
5,How to attitudes toward change in life,In life we have things changing all the time. And the more we growthe more changes come at us. The question is how do we cope with it. Thisbook is really good seeing a different side to making that happen. It'sa really quick and easy read - which I love that about this book.I give it five stars because how easy the read is andthe how effective the story inside the book can be foranyone that reads the book and looks inside themselvesand makes the changes necessary to adapt to change.Matt BacakAuthor of The Ultimate Lead Generation Planand Secrets of the Internet Millionaire Mind
2,Overhyped,"This was a very easy book to read. I believe I finished it in less than an hour. It is not the life changing deep book that I was led to believe it was from other reviews. I do think it offers a good metaphor for people to talk about change, but come on everybody in this generation knows things don't stay the same."
1,Drivel...,That this passes for an insightful or meaningful fable is in itself a damming indictment of the American educational experience and corporate culture. No wonder we produce charlatans like Ken Lay.
2,Who moved it? Who really cares???,"I really did NOT like this book. I found the concepts contained therein to be demeaning from a management perspective. If you are looking for something profound then this is not the book for you. The contents are base at best. This is stuff that you probably should have figured out when you got your first job. I see all these 5 star reviews and I can't help but think that they must be written by people I would absolutely hate to work for: the butt kissers, the do nothing management types and the general cluseless. Let's face, if you need a parable about mice to help you understand and adapt to the corporate work environment then you will wind up in one of 2 camps: the ra-ra managers who eat this stuff up or you'll be the sucker who works for them. I giving this book 2 stars on the basis that the author managed to write more than 20 pages on what should only have been a paragraph at best."
1,Insulting to My Intelligence,"This book was a waste of my time and an insult to the intelligence of anyone over 8 years old, or 69 IQ points. Fortunately, it only wasted 30 minutes of my time, as it is so short it should rightfully be called a tract. A warning to employers: This book will not endear you to your staff! If you liken your employees to mice, they will return the favor, and liken you to a rat."
2,Mediocrity at its finest,"Overhyped by management gurus as the next best thing since the sliced pan, supposed to open up ones eyes to the world of change, give me a break, take any management principles book summary and give it large fonts and say it will change the way you look at the world and presto who moved my cheese. If this is they new way of looking at the world then get me a mouse trap.However,well done to the authors for selling it so well."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I'll never understand the popularity of this book. I found it to be simplistic, not offering anything I didn't already know. I wish there was an option to give it 0 stars. It didn't deserve one. My copy, given to me [...] went into the trash. It's the first book I have ever thrown away. I always donate books to book fairs. I didn't want anyone else subjected to this book!"
4,WHO MOVED MY CHEESE,EXCELLENT WITH A QUICK READ. SUMS UP PEOPLE IN A WONDERFUL WAY AND TRULY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND THE EMPLOYEES I'M PRIVILEDGED TO WORK WITH. I'D RECOMMEND ANY OFFICE MANAGER/DIRECTOR READ AND PASS AROUND THE OFFICE.
5,The best for knowing if you're going in the right direction.,"If you don't know where you're going, how will you know when you get there? This book helps to determine if your efforts are going to get you to where you really want to be in five or ten years from now. It's written in a lovable, laughable and yet realistic manner in which everyone can identify. It's an easy read -- 45 minutes to an hour, very entertaining while highly informative and instructive."
3,Amusing interpretations!,"I'm laughing as I read the reviews for this book. The intrepretations pretty much cover the gamut. I see not where some get the impression this book poses an image of the giant corporate pressing thumb telling you to get used to change or die. I enjoyed the book somewhat although I agree it's everything we, who are of at least average intelligence, already knew and ponder on a daily basis. The best message for me in this book is something I've been hammering into my brain endlessly for the past few years, so far, with no results. The line reads, ""We keep doing the same things over and over again and wonder why things don't get better."" We all need to absorb that.The second most powerfull message in this reading to me is to pay attention to what's going on around you. Some of us are blind to the inevitable.Cheers,Phil Vanderloo"
5,Hey I got the Cheese!,A great story and an excellent message that prepares you for change. I loved the simpleness of the story and the underlying lesson. Very similar to another book that I read recently - Eightstorm: 8-Step Brainstorming.
2,Pure mush that the Comic Strip Dilbert warns about,"Let's be honest. If you're reading this book it's because you work in an office and the latest manager has reinvented the office in their own image. So, you have to live with the change or else dust that resume off and look for another job.This book is canned tripe. If you have to read it and talk about it then it may be part of your yearly performance objectives at work.Buy the audio version if you really have study this book.I read this book and received no better information than when an old Army sergeant told me to ""suck it up and deal with it"". Indeed, other information that wise sergeant told me was ""quit your b**ching."""
2,Who Moved My Cheese?,"I read this book at work in about 15 minutes. The ideas that it was trying to get across are great, but I think that it could have done it in a more adult and mature way. I laughed through most of the book and thought that most of the story was really dumb. I guess that I was expecting a more realistic approach to the philosophy of ""go get 'em"". The mice and the cheese is really something that I would read to a 5 year old."
5,You Create Your Own Results,"This parable points out that accepting what is can cause us to settle for things that are not very good for us, such as easy access to our needs for the moment. Like the careful person who prepares for a rainy day, if we think through what must be done we can become more capable, more satisfied, and contribute more. Many people are working very hard to achieve things that are not very important to them, like money and greater size, while things that are really important, like family and self-satisfaction, receive little attention. Habits can be harmful, and I am reminded of ""The 2,000 Percent Solution"" which helps people create a heathier set of habits in their organizational life. You should read both to get the most out of your life"
1,This book is not worth a piece of cheese,Please do not waste your time and money on this book. It it outrageous that such a simple idea has received so much hype. Anyone with an ounce of common sense will get nothing new from this book. If my boss had given me this book to read I would have been so insulted that I would have immediately gone in search of new cheese!
1,Superficial pop-psychology,"A superficial application of pop-psychology to the issue of dealing with change by means of an allegory concerning four small creatures trapped in a maze (life, tradition, circumstances) and needing cheese (meaning, significance, value, power, self-fulfillment). Hardly worth the 30 minutes it takes to read it and definitely not worth the expense."
1,A grate book,"the co. i worked for bought 1,000 copieswe would get into cheez groups named cheeder, blue, etcsmiles all aroundshort messagedon't question authoritydon't worrybe happydont mind the cheez"
2,Overated,"A ""cheesey"" self help book. If it was regular font it would be 10 pages with the graphics.Don't understand what the fuss is about this book."
4,Great tool for dealing with change in life,"This is a great tool for dealing with change in life. We were experiencing some major changes on my job, and I purchased this for my entire team. I would highly recommend it."
2,A bit juvenile & repetitive.,"I understood early in the story that change was not to be feared. This would inspire me, in my work life, to look for another job when faced with a changing work environment. However, I was hoping for insight on how to deal with change without having to ""scurry"" away. I wanted to buy this tape for my team of co-workers but I don't want them abandoning ship so I will keep it to myself. Also, the repitition of the theme seemed to bore even my kids."
1,Who Got Bored with Cheese?,"I read this book because my employer at the time recommended it. First of all, if the CEO of your company encourages everyone to read this book because of new management... BEWARE! It means ""We're going to change things, and like it or not, some of you will be forced to look for new types of cheese at other cheese factories"" or ""We're cutting back on your cheese allowances, so deal with it and don't complain.""I found the book to be trite and condescending. The reading level seemed to be geared toward a 3rd grader instead of a business professional who's been through college. If you have to read this book to learn to deal with change, then heaven help you. Anyone could've written this ""parable,"" and probably have done a better job. Why this is a best seller is beyond me."
5,The only thing constant is change!,"Who Moved My Cheese is a great book about managing change. Through observing the decision making process of Hem and Haw you learn the value of flexibility, of being aware of your biases, of maintaining a positive attitude, and learning how to stay focused on your goals. This book creatively illustrates how easy it is to become obsessed with our possessions, with our station in life, and our beliefs. The writers use the cheese as a metaphor to show us how sometimes damaging it can be to resist change and how, in these instances, the only way to thrive is to be open and embrace it."
5,Chang is inevitable. How will you handle it?,"This is a great book and relevant to today's workplace! There are any number of changes we may face, and knowing how to handle them with dignity and strength is a skill everyone should strengthen, no matter what your position. A very inspiring and encouraging look at how to overcome!"
1,Worthless hooey. Negative stars if possible.,"I sit here in awe that this worthless waste of time and moneyhas gained mostly high reviews. The print is quite large, too. Toobad I can't rate negative stars... If you would enjoy seeing your life and livelihood described in Kindergartner's analogies, this book is for you. ""So simple my fourth graders can read it,"" says one review above, yet they want adults at risk of losing their jobs to read this worthless drivel? Don't waste your time. END"
1,Bless you Alberto,"Yup, Alberto got here got it right. We were handed this book by our manager who knew nothing about his job or ours to get us to toe the party line. It worked. We shut up. Since then employees left in droves and productivity has been sinking ever since! Nice job Cheesies!"
1,la la land,"This highly talked about book lacks depth. The steps used in looking at change are clear, but running forward without checking what is around the corner is just as dangerous as not moving. This book connects what is needed for change to a happy ending. The middle steps of strategic planning and predictions are missing. What would be most useful is if a Stephen King element was added. Around the maze there are traps, the unknown is not always safe and without planning can be very dangerous. There are many other books that are more informational and useful when looking at the changing process."
2,"Juvenile, stop telling us what we already know.","All management staff was asked to read this - only takes about thirty minutes. Although there were a few gems, most of the book was a re-hash. The information in the book could have been summarized in just a few sentences."
1,This cheeze grates!,"I was bothered by this book for the following reasons:1) Hyperbolic title and self-reviews2) The use of the words ""little people"" for those of us who are not managers. This is very insulting.3) Too high a price for such simple ideas. The message is basically that if someone moves your cheese, you shouldn't keep going to the old place, hoping to find it there.4) I don't see the author as a peer, and that doesn't help. He has an M.D., a lot of money, is more likely than I to be giving orders than receiving them, and is not subject in the same way to layoffs, downsisizings, restructurings, etc. It seems fairly clear that he has found HIS cheeze by looking in new places, so maybe there IS a useful message in the book; however, I still get the feeling I am being patronized by someone who knows very little about my situation.5) I was practically forced to read the book."
1,Downward Spiral of Traditions,"One Minute Manager was a good book for new managers who just didn't have any style. The authors missed with Who Moved My Cheese, in my opinion. Who Moved My Cheese is rhetoric of almost infantile style aimed at deteriorating the thought process of respect amongst those that are human. Stop moving my cheese! Just because I'm a nonconformist doesn't mean I don't think. Just because I don't happen to agree, doesn't mean I'm not correct. Sure, we create these little microcosms in our places of employment. Yes, we need to change . . . keeping pace with our competitors. Yes, this overly simplified philosophy would probably be useful for someplace such as McDonalds, Burger King, and the like. The world in general, though, is not this simple. Our (America's) education system is dwindling because of this very logic. Soon we will all be followers reading books like this one."
1,Here's the condensed version of this book:,"Change is inevitable. You can choose to either embrace it and thrive, or resist it and suffer the consequences.There -- I just saved you ... and a half hour you would have wasted in reading this unbelievably simple-minded book that is unaccountably receiving rave reviews from many reviewers."
5,A monumental triumph over fear of the unknown!,"Dr. Johnson's prescription for overcoming the anxieties associated with change in your personal, corporate and spiritial life was right on the mark. The way that it was presented through the seminar I attended was energetic, motivating and most importiantly FUN! Always take time to smell the cheese daily."
5,Powerfully reinforcing and encouraging,"Reading this book was enjoyable and encouraging. Having to deal with change and trying to get others to understand why changes are desirable, this was a great response to the old saying, ""It isn't broke, why fix it?"" Simple, yes, and everyone should be able to relate. Excellent book for people facing unasked for change in their lives and everyone else as well. It has helped me to be more patient with those who don't see that ""the cheese has moved."""
3,A brief allegory that could help some to rethink change,"Spencer Johnson provides a story that could help reluctant people to reconsider their position about change and their assessment of it.While many may find it ""overly simplistic"", or ""cute"" I am anxious to share it with co-workers to determine if it will have any impact. At a minimun, it could serve as a focal point for an open discussion of change in our working environment."
1,Inspires patient admittance into the psychiatric unit,"As the title states, simply profound if you're able to loose touch with reality you'll discover yourself in the hospitals psychiatric unit."
4,"An entertaining, helpful and enjoyable book","Never having been a lover of self help books because I have often found them to be patronising and quite frankly rather boring, I have to confess I really did enjoy this book ,finding it entertaining, readable ,and actually quite helpful ! The idea of self help being delivered through the eyes of delighfully befuddled mice and 'Littlepeople' really appealed to me and made the whole concept of self improvement far more attractive and achievable ! Having searched for other books using this format I chanced upon 'SERENDIPITY'S SECRET ;a novel way to achieve your dreams and find the path to happiness'. This book, like Who Moved My Cheese, must be amongst The Creme de la Creme of self help books and I would thoroughly recommend both these titles to anyone looking for an enjoyable journey through the minefield of self improvement !"
1,"So MOVE, already....","Things not good? Move on. Unless it's something worth fighting for (BUT, this idea is not stressed). Another book from this group that is ONE simple idea, turned into a 20-30 buck book. Series should be called ""how to keep dummies spending money for VERY little info""."
2,You need an expensive book to tell you this stuff?,"Why does one need a book to tell what this book tells you?Motivation begins with oneself. No matter what, you still got to get out of your chair to do whatever. This costly little book isn't going to do anything for you. To be honest, I didn't even bother to finish reading, got bored. Nice attempt by the author. Maybe this stuff works for some people. Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, it isn't."
1,Lacks real value,"Cute story, but written at grade school level. Nothing valuable here, anyone with common sense knows the lesson given here. Save your money."
1,"Simplistic book with a disturbing, unsatisfying moral","This book is too simplistic, and while the change-is-good message is important, the delivery of the tale is poor. The story-in-a-story convention feels horribly forced and by mixing mice and littlepeople, the author took an easy out rather than work out the story's details.Because of poor writing, I have concluded from the author's story that: 1) It is good to let a friend starve rather than leave your own comfortable stash of cheese (how Haw left Hem). 2) It is best to act like a rodent.A better author would have delivered the message with more consistency and greater satisfaction."
5,How to welcome change,An amazing story that takes you through a maze where yoou see the whole picture. Life from all sides!It focuses on how you adapt to change when it comes and why you should go on and never stop.Very easy to grasp concept for both the average person and the business person.
1,another lame-brained management book,"I'm beginning to think that business authors think management is just a bunch of idiots, and judging from the popularity of this book among management reading groups, they may be right. This is yet another simple-minded management book with a message that could be stated in one sentence. If it takes an entire book to get the message across, I see little hope for corporate America."
4,"Wierd title, but interesting book","I read this while we were on vacation. Nice and relaxed, so I thought I would give this book a go thru. At first, "" Cheese"" what does this mean??? Well, like the books says, it can mean anything you want it to. Each quote, in the book was a different situation and fits to several different things going on in my life. Some huge some just trivial things. I also found myself alot like some of the characters, Hem- who doesn't want to do anything except complain about it!!! Haw- who goes after it and tries to look for it, again and again. The two mice who just go from the beginning and look for it with no regard to Hem and Haw. I do encourage anyone to read this- and don't think of it as Cheese.....it can be any situation or problem you have in your life."
4,"Here's why,","I did enjoy this book, besides using imagination and experience, the author needs to back up with stonger real life evidence. I read Karl Maddox SB: 1 or God which carries a similar tune but more on line with real life and supported, also has a story line. Who moved my cheese could use a bit more story per se to entertain the reader. The message is here but could be conveyed a bit more entertianing."
4,A Fable to live by,"Fairytales do come true. This is a very clever and simple story about mice who ultimately find the cheese. But on the metaphor-meter, it's a story about learning to notice change, accepting it, and adapting to change. Why? Because you'll lower your blood pressure, you'll get your ""cheese"" and eat it, too. I read this book in an hour. And, my mind has changed in how I'm approaching change. Buy this book!"
1,More Corporate Crap,"When you see this book come through your company or institution get ready for the layoffs. Corporate speak for ""the layoffs are on the way""."
5,Great Reminder...,"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I am glad I took his advice to read it. It was a quick read and a great reminder of how to not get stuck trying to make something work that just isn't there anymore. Keep moving. Look at the requirement to change as an opportunity to try something new...maybe something you've never done before, or maybe something you have not done in a long time. I recommended that my folks read it. I recommend that you read it, too..."
3,"Reminders Don't Hurt, I Guess.","Here's the premise in one sentence: Learn to embrace change instead of fearing it, and you'll be more happy/successful/productive, etc. in your life. If you STILL choose to read the book, it should take you an hour. Maybe you will appreciate being reminded of the obvious-- there are many books like this that do a good job of articulating things that you've already known intuitively. Readers over 30 probably won't get a lot of mileage out of it, but I recommend it to kids in their late teens through early twenties. ..."
2,Change or No Cheese for You.,A cute story with a message: Change happens and people react to change differently. Those who adapt well prosper. Borrow the book...
2,My personal experience with this book!,"Please know that ""Who Moved My Cheese"" is a book that some companies use to hand out to their employees right before there's a big lay off.They use this book to try and prep them not to have a melt down or go postal after they've been thrown out into the street.I had this experience myself and had read the book a week before the lay off. Months later I found out that other medium to large companies also use this book as their ""ether cloth over the mouth and nose"" of their own doomed employees. Did the book work on me or my fellow employees? What do you think? No!"
3,"Confrontational, enlightening but too simple","This book uses two mice and two little people who look like mice to make a serious point. How do you respond to change? In Who Moved My Cheese?, we see those who immediately seek a new viable option, those who move forward only when a situation is life threatening, and those who refuse to budge. Isn't this what we see in everyday life? My biggest concern about this book is that the question provided to deal with the fear that stops us from moving forward is ""What would I do if I wasn't afraid?"" This is an example of repressive coping, and does not deal with the reason for the fear, and does not resolve the fear. To learn how to best deal with troublesome feelings that stop us from making the most of our lives, I recommend Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self. I recommend each of these books."
4,One good thing,"The way I look at it, if you can cull one really good thing from an experience, then the experience was worth it. For me, the simple thought of ""what would you do if you weren't afraid"" was it. This simple little thought has made me rethink and move forward more quickly than I previously would have.If you're already an adventurous person bent on changing the world, read this book anyway. It'll give you a glimpse of how other people view things. Learn from that and be more effective with others as you create your change."
1,STUPID BOOK MY BOSS GAVE ME,"An old boss of mine gave me this book to borrow for the night. It could easily be read in about one hour. It is the most boring book I have ever read in my life. Maybe if you were reading it to a 10 year, this would be fine. I just dont see the point of using these concepts to explain common sense everyday life that we through. Get a life! and grab another book."
2,Demographically Narrow,"Unless you are 55 and have worked at the same company for 30 years (think Creed on the Office), nothing in this book is going to shock you. That said, it espouses useful life lessons and is worth thinking about every so often. If only the metaphor weren't stretched so thin..."
3,Review,"This book was a great way to show that getting in a routine can make someone blind to their surrounds and potentially miss parts of their life. The book is very simple, and is great for a basic life lesson, but what i dont like about the book is that it focuses just on Haw. It answers the questions one may have about someone who is able to see the changes eventually, but the book does not develop Hem, Sniff or Scurry. To me, to be a complete book, the author would develop all four of the characters, because not all people are like Haw. You have your Sniffs and Scurrys, people who are able to rush off without thinking, following their feelings and living their life without analyzing and over analyzing every situation. And you have your Hems, people who are so stubborn that they will stick to their ways and refuse to change their lifestyles, no matter what happens. I just feel that this book would be even better if it would develop all four characters, not just one."
1,Who downsized my brain?,"This offensively simple-minded pamphlet of useless advice is only given out by managers about to lay-off as many people as they can. Then, to take away from horrors of losing your job, you're meant to feel happy because ""change is good"". Not only that... you're meant to believe that questioning change is for losers -- as if change just comes magically from above, and not as a result of corporate incompetence and greed at the highest levels.If your boss gives you this book (or worse, makes you buy it yourself), I recommend getting ""who cut the cheese"" by Mason Brown, instead. And also, remember to steal as many office supplies as you can."
2,Lowest common denominator,"I didn't like this book, I think it tries to appeal to everyone, which is not really democratic but in a sense pretentious. It's like the author is saying "" look, I can write a book about success in whatever arena, and have it accepted by everyone."" I believe self-help books appeal not to people especially seeking self knowledge, but to people looking for ways to promote themselves. This book is a capitalistic device to reinforce the idea of the American Dream."
5,I loved it,This book is one of those timeless pieces of wisdom. No matter who you are or what your situation you will get something out of reading this book. It is basic and I think of it as a reminder. We don't always remember to overcome our fears. Even if we have read in the past that we should. Being reminded every so often is not a bad thing.
5,Good Stuff,"I am using this textbook for an MBA course. I had already started the class when I ordered the book, but I received my book in enough time where I was not left behind. I appreciate the prompt service. Thanks:-)"
2,Nothing one should not already know...,"If you are a deep and/or spiritual person, you probably already live by the philosophy presented in the book. However, if you are a young soul, it's worth the read."
3,It's an OK book,"Just like most of the people, I got this book from my employer (I hope it's not a sign of restructuring :)).I'm afraid that I do a too good job of reviewing the book one would no longer need to buy it anymore. In essence, the whole book can be summarized in about 10 statements. In all fairness though, these are insightful and worth meditating on statements.So, like I said... An OK book."
4,Good for people in Business,"I work for a small business and our market has been changing. This cd makes you think about things. It doesn't tell you here is your situation, and here is what you need to do to change it. It is a story. Your imagination needs to do the rest."
3,Self Explanatory,"I read this book twice since it is very elementary reading material. The first time I didn't get it, so I read it again to see if there was a hidden meaning and there wasn't. Basically it said everything that I was taught as a kid so I missed all of the ""hype"" aboutn this book."
4,So who won?,"In this book, Sniff and Scurry move from an unsuccessful market area without thought of what they may do to improve it. Hem and Haw make an effort to improve the original cheese location (recover the market share) but do not seek opportunities outside the local market. Haw finally moves out and after much searching finds that the rats win! Moral of the story: don't think about what you are doing, just sniff and scurry around in the marketplace and you get the best cheese."
1,Simplistic introspectiion,"After reading this book, I've decided that it is an extremely simplified segregation of what all of us feel inside at any given time in our lives. In fact, I had a hard time of hurdling the first flaw in the writing... the cheese is described as the consolidation of what one would want in my life, yet the entire book removes the power from the entity creating the cheese to say that the cheese can be molded and removed from someone's life. I don't buy that... scenarios change... my cheese preference remains the same. When the scenario changes is when I go elsewhere to find the fulfilling cheese. At any rate, this is mediocre at best."
5,Great Management Tool on Change,This is one of the painless books I've read. This is a great management tool to help our folks try to understand and manage change.
1,Who Moved My Cheese,This is one of the best books that I have read for motivating people. The way it is presented includes both humor and different scenarios that make people want to continue reading.Most of my employees were surprised that they recognize themselves in the book.I would highly reccomend this book for ANY manager to share with their employees.
5,Awesome,I have read this book countless times. Understanding the way some things are so present and yet far away. I will continue to use the principles in this book for my person and professional life.
3,Quite obvious,Makes sense but nothing new here; childishly contrived. I think age and experience have a lot to do with one's reaction. I was told about the book by a young man who thinks that it had a profound effect on the direction of his career.
4,Interesting,"I was required to read this book but I rather enjoyed it. It has a good message behind it and if you are in business or education, you might find it helpful."
2,Fine premise. Lame book.,"Someone recommended this book to me and gave me a brief overview. There wasn't much more to it than the overview. Granted, the key to success is presumably simple: work hard, find success, fix or improve on strategies that don't anymore. I suppose I have learned the lesson it's teaching, but it was maddenly basic. Maybe that means I'll remember it forever now?"
5,It's like a candy store of window treatment ideas.,This book is full of so many ideas that it made it so much easier to pick the correct style for our client and easily communicate the concept to our seamstress.
5,Great Source for Professional Workroom,"This is a great source for interior designers, decorators or for Professional Workrooms. Any window treatment imaginable is available for the customer to view. Definitely a good investment."
5,Fascinating,This is the greatest book I ever read as a 10 year old boy. As an adult male I still re-read the book!
4,works great,I use this and it works well on skin. The only complaint is the sulfur smell is small but who wants to smell like sulfur. I wouldn't use right before going out.
3,Didn't help acne but great for exfoliation,First this product is way overpriced - but I will pay that if it works.I can't say that this did anything at all for my acne - but it is a pretty 'harsh' scrub and it is great for exfoliation. My skin feels smooth and clean when I use it.While I wish I had some miracle results on the acne side - I would use it again for the 'scrub factor'. Do wish it was a little less expensive.
3,Too strong for my skin,I have had acne for a few years now that I can't get to go away. I tried this product and it seemed to help for maybe a day and then after that it got worse. I think it was too harsh on my skin and dried me out. If you are looking for a really good way to clear up your acne try this:Buy some garlic and a garlic pressBuy some milkCrush garlic into a little bit of milk (about 2 shots worth of milk)Let it sit for 30 minutes (to help rid of the garlic smell)Swig it downDo this every other dayGarlic worked wonders for me. Give it a shot! I also suggest the Murad acne supplements - I did this in conjunction with the garlic.
3,A so-so compilation from their Capitol years.,"Contains songs from their Capitiol albums, including live performances of their earlier hits like Ventura Highway and I Need You. Not a bad album, but Capitol did have better material to pick from."
2,Don't Get Fooled Like Me!!!!!,"The songs on this CD are ALL LIVE. If that is what you want, then this CD might be for you. If you want the studio versions of ""You Can Do Magic"", ""The Border"" and ""Today's The Day"", you are better buying ""Encore- More Greatest Hits"" on Rhino Records."
3,A so-so collection,"This is a so-so collection of songs from their Capitol albums, recorded in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It includes live recordings from their 1985 In Concert album (Ventura Highway and I Need You). It also includes their 1982 top ten hit You Can Do Magic and their last top 40 hit, 1983's The Border. Not a bad collection, but there are better ones available. I would recommend you pass on this and buy Complete Greatest Hits or if you are looking for a cheaper collection, you can't go wrong with the A Horse With No Name and Other Hits CD."
3,A so-so collection,"This is a so-so collection of songs from their Capitol albums, recorded in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It includes live recordings from their 1985 In Concert album (Ventura Highway and I Need You). It also includes their 1982 top ten hit You Can Do Magic and their last top 40 hit, 1983's The Border (though on the cassette version, The Border was a live version from the In Concert album, but on the CD it was the studio version - strange). Not a bad collection, but there are better ones available. I would recommend you pass on this and buy Complete Greatest Hits or if you are looking for a cheaper collection, you can't go wrong with the A Horse With No Name and Other Hits CD."
3,A mix of studio and live recordings,"Despite what a previous reviewer has said, this is NOT an all live CD. It is a mixture of studio and live recordings. It is a low budget compilation. Not bad, but not great. This is a collection of songs from their Capitol albums, recorded in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It includes live recordings from their 1985 In Concert album (Ventura Highway and I Need You). It also includes their 1982 top ten hit You Can Do Magic and their last top 40 hit, 1983's The Border. Not a bad collection, but there are better ones available. I would recommend you pass on this and buy Complete Greatest Hits or if you are looking for a cheaper collection, you can't go wrong with the A Horse With No Name and Other Hits CD."
4,So happy!,"These things came in handy. The old ones I had had broken into the guitar, and I needed some new ones. Picked these up and was extremely happy with the quality."
1,Cheap Plastic Pins,"I bought these for my Martin D-18. There pins are made in Mexico for Martin. They are cheap plastic bridge pins that cost about the same as Martin's solid wood ebony pins. I would recommend skipping these and buying the solid wood pins. If you want white, you will need to search for bone pins that cost about $25.00."
5,Double check the product description vs picture...then buy,The pins were okay. Inexpensive but NOT what I thought I was getting. I should have read closer to see that what I bought was NOT what was pictured. I got plain white and not the white w/inlay as was pictured. Live and learn.ATTENTION: The seller has since contacted me directly and has sent me the exact pins I thought I was getting at no charge just to make things right. I hope more sellers are as responsive as Hole in the Wall Music. I'm adding this edit to the original review to alert buyers that this seller is first rate. Thanks Hole in the Wall Music.
3,Look Real Good,These look real good but they are plastic pins.They work OK but were a little small for my Sigma Guitar.They don't enhance the sound any.
4,Hauls more than motorcycles,"We bought this last Christmas (2004) for my son then 5. It was a huge hit. He loves the fact that he can take the motorcycles off and play with them by themselves. In my house, the platform hauls more than the motorcycles. He uses it to move anything that will on top around the house. Almost a year later it is still one of his favorite toys. It is very durable. It has been dropped, washed, run into walls and furniture and it still is in one piece. A great product and toy for the car/truck/motorcycle lover in your child."
1,Disappointed,"I took time before I write this review. I just thought I might need to try it a little bit. It's been almost 2 months since I ordered the pillows. they arrived very fast...but I just couldn't adjust to them. They are just not comfortable. I stopped sleeping on them. They really don't support the neck. you feel that you are sleeping on nothing. you just sink into them. and I really mean sink, as if nothing is under your head!!!so if you don't like to sleep on ""nothing"" don't order them. they are useless for me. I am thinking to combine the feathers from both pillows I got into only one pillow.. maybe then things get better.Also they smell.. maybe all feather pillows are like that. but I really didn't expect what I got!!."
1,Not Pleased!,"I am not pleased at with the pillowa, it's like not sleeping on any pillow and it sounds like I'm sleeping on paper. It rattles like paper! I do not like them. Thank you, Pam Duff"
4,"If you have not read the book yet, do not read!! may spoil!","I can't even lie, this book was GOOD. But something was missing...like I can't put my finger on it but something wasn't quite there that needed to be. So many situations were left out that could have been continued. It kinda leaves you hanging. Like, Nafiq's sister. What about her abortion, did she ever tell her parents? Did she ever tell them about her ex fiance and his sexcapades? Does Nafiq ever speak to his homie Shawn again? How does Nafiq and Julian's long distance relationship turn out? What about Julian and Lamar's friendship (or the lack thereof)?Not only that but the book definitely moves quickly. It doesn't say how much time passes between each chapter so when Julian and Nafiq ""hook up"" I felt it was all of a sudden. But regardless of it all the book definitely keeps you interested and I hope there is a part two.Maybe that's why he kept a lot of things out?? I sure hope so :)"
4,Very Intersting Book,"This book is very interesting if you are young trying to understand your sexuality. The main character Nafiq, was a young ambitious man with goals who tried to keep his sexual preference a secret. But when his secret got out, his life went out of control. With no help from his parents or best friends he had to try to figure his life back out. If you're looking for a novel that keeps you interested you should definitely buy this book. I could not put it down once I started reading it. I finished it in one sitting."
2,"Interesting book, but not well written; unbelieveable characters, etc.","As someone previoulsy alluded, this book is for teenagers, which is a very good thing, indeed. There isn't much out there for young men and women of color who are gay or questioning so, from that aspect, BREATHE gets a gold star. As for the writing, it's not particularly good. There are, however, a few passages where Mr. Poole clearly indicates he has talent as a writer. As for the story: I really can't comment about what happens to Nafig after his parents find out his gay - maybe things like that do happen. If it does, that's tragic and heart-breaking, though, Mr. Poole's handling of the situation was predictiable and formulaic, but without any real tension. The plotting, at times, seemed contrived to make a point and character development was seriously lacking. Not a bad book; just somewhat incomplete in its execution."
3,It was alright.,This book reminded me of myself when I was in high school. Although the book is capable of holding the readers attention it was was very predictable.
3,Above average but not GREAT.,"BLair R. Poole's book BREATHE is a page turner and could easily be made into a film or TV movie. He occassionally slips up with regards to his characters and I couldn't understand his tangent for describing the rainbow that is BLACK (""honesuckle""; ""dark""; ""caramel-colored""; ""almond-colored""; ""hazelnut""; ""cocoa""; ""light-skinned"". Enough already!).The ending seemed hopelessly optimistic and ""hollywood-driven"" but all in all, despite its flaws, it is an interesting read about a subject matter seldom discussed in mainstream Black communities."
3,"Nice try, but...","I had high hopes when I started reading this book. 3 hours later...and finished. Pretty disappointing. Very stereotypical, very predictable, not well developed story, dialogue or characters. The book wraps up so quickly you'd have thought the author was about to run out of paper. Maybe the target audience is a teenager; certainly not a grown adult."
2,"Neat idea, poor engineering.","This filter does not prime itself without a lot of help from you. Lots of air gets trapped in the intake tube and is a real headache to clear this and get any kind of water flowthrough the filter. The bio-wheel does not spin very easily and needs a lot of water to spin it, which this filter fails to provide. So the wheel usually just sits there. I've owned larger versions of this filter in the past, and had the same problems. They require a ton of fiddling-with after a water change, power outage, etc to get them going correctly. Buy a different brand and be happier."
2,Not as good as in recent years,"The work in this year's edition doesn't compare to earlier One Shows. More often, I found myself looking at the same ads/ideas/campaigns over and over, page after page.For the investment, I was sorely disappointed. I'd suggest skipping this one and waiting 'till next year. Better yet, just ask to borrow a friend's for the weekend. That's about as much time as you'll need to spend going through it, given the scant amount of inspiring work it contains."
4,Miss Potter Soundtrack,"I haven't seen the movie yet, but I saw the cd on amazon and liked the samples I heard. It does tend to sound very much like you're listening to a movie without dialogue, which is probably what most people expect. I had hoped it would stand on its own a little stronger based on the samples I heard. The total playtime is shorter than I expected (42 minutes)for 15 tracks.I like it and I am glad to have it, but I may have been slightly disappointed if I had paid more than $10 (I only paid around $6 including shipping)."
4,Soothing and Lively,"Movie's soundtrack intrigued me. The CD has some beautiful pieces by Rachel Portman (Cider House Rules, Emma, etc.). Very much worth listening to once every few weeks to put one in a pleasant mood."
3,That ONE song,"We had just watched Miss Potter on cable... and as the credits rolled, the most haunting melody came on.It was probably the only time we sat through the entire credits.We bought the CD for When You Taught Me How To Dance. Of course."
3,"Interesting concept, spotty quality","The quality of the stories in ""Women of Darkness"" varies wildly, and many of them are amateurish, but anyone who's interested in both horror and women's issues will enjoy it anyway because it's fascinating to see a gender-specific take on fear. (We've got three child molesters, three unfaithful husbands, an abusive mother, a serial rapist ...)The best of the stories (like Tanith Lee's ""The Devil's Rose"" and Kit Reed's ""Baby) could stand their own anywhere."
4,Read It for yourself.,I thought the book was well written.I almost did not read the book after seeing the last review.I felt like the poster of the last review maybe had unrealistic hopes for the book.There is a connection in the book between the author and Sylvia.And revealing the ending spoils it for everyone else.I am glad I read the book anyway.Go with the other review and read the book if you are a fan of Sylvia.
4,Excellent Classic!,I have grown up with this recipe book and treasure it. I have probably bought over 100 books and I still go back to this one often. This recipe book is geared more towards bakers and I won't ever look for another butter tart recipe than the one in this book. It was created by the Five Roses flour company and has excellent bread recipes and great black & white photos. An oldie but a very goodie!
2,Dissapointed,"the first thing i do not like about it, compared to the one i have, is it doesn't stay open, # 2 no pictures for the recipe, some items missing, example, Prize Pizza, the dough is the same but no recipe for sause, like the old one, well when i return home in the Yukon shortly will have to make sure i take care of my old version mine is priceless, compared to what i received, and i got my first one for free,"
5,Love It!!,"I bought this cook book for my mom. She loves her original, however that poor book has seen it's days!lol. This five roses flour cook book (soft cover,it had to be a soft cover for her anyways)It's the exact same recipes in this third edition five roses cook book. It's great! THANX!!"
5,"Very happy to get a clean, nicely bound version of our favourite cookbook","After 40 years of marriage and cooking, glad to have our tried and true, most used cookbook in a beautiful new look."
4,Be sure,This was a great bargin but just to let you know when this comes in be prepare to put in a lot of hard labor and you will need some help and a power drill. One of my nails was dysfuntional but we still put together. My growing boys love it and was happy to see it when they came home from school.
2,"A little ""over the top""","I thought I was going to experience something new,(judging by the title).I was intrigued by the chain link scarf on the cover, but found it was the only pattern I could use. Projects in the book were just not my cup of tea.The designs in this book are not meant for the Grandmotherly type!"
2,"bad sizes, great photos, patterns need interpreting","like everyone says, unless you're a model, the sizes are not for people who eat anything other than air. i mean, i am a small athletic woman and even the larges are too small.i also found that i have to re-write the patterns as i knit to make sense of them or to correct things that are plainly left out.this book is not as bad as twinkles big city knits, but it's getting there!i give it two stars because i appreciate patterns using needles larger than size 4. and as i am a professional photographer i really enjoy the photography. i also LOVE the asymmetrical hat. although, i did change that pattern to be worked in the round and grafted at the top."
4,It's in the details,A wonderful and inspiring volume for the thinking knitter. Lots of great design and the details on the garments are exciting. Worth having in your knitting library just to keep your ideas fresh and your knitting mind open.
2,Just too Weird for me,"If you are looking for avant-garde styles and advanced patterns, then this book is for you. I found the patterns to be difficult to understand and the designs nothing I would ever wear."
2,Nothing that I would make,"Perhaps if you are very young and like edgy things, you would love this book. For me, there was nothing in it that I would ever make. I admit that I didn't do my research and thought that ""Loop-d-Loop"" would be a new knitting technique -- it isn't. This one goes into the donation box."
4,"I love this book, but----","This book has some of the wittiest and most innovative knitting designs I've seen in quite awhile. Even some of the designs that, at first glance, seem too far out grow on you over time. My major problem (and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5) is that the garment sizes are TOO SMALL for anyone in the plus or nearly plus size ranges. That leaves many of us out in the cold. ""Loop-d-Loop"" has some wonderful patterns for scarves and other such items, but sizing problems limit the usefulness of the book."
1,teva duram should learn to knit...and add,"Don't waste your money on this book. I knitted the riding jacket in Teva Duram's Loop D Loop book. I have never seen so many errors in a pattern. I knitted the medium size and none of the numbers in the pattern worked. The origional cast-on number yeilded 10 too many stitches in the back of the jacket at the bottom of the arm hole separation and there were still 2 more increase rows to go! Other mistakes included markers in the wrong place, decreases going the wrong direction and the cables in the front sections twisting in the wrong direction. She obviously has never knitted her own design."
2,Lots of errors,"As an experienced knitter, I found the ideas very interesting and exciting. However, knitting the actual pieces is fraught with frustration. The instructions are both poorly written and contain *a lot* of errors. There are no 'correction' pages on her website nor did she answer any emails regarding the pattern instructions. Several expert knitter friends suggested that rather than continue to waste time attempting to dicipher and amend her instructions, I ought to simply look at the photographs and create my own set of instructions. Not at all what I expect from a knitting magazine editor and designer. However, the ideas are certainly interesting--which the only reason I gave it 2 stars."
2,2 out of 40!!,"This book is full of home-made knitting, lots of extravagantknitting, and with just two proyect with possibilities, not a book worth buying. I rate it two stars for the photos!"
5,"At second glance, I can't live without it","I must admit, the first time I flipped through the book, I wasn't really grabbed by anything. Perhaps my mind wasn't in the right zone. However, I went back for round #2 and spent a good half an hour pouring over the book, and now I can barely find anything I wouldn't make. I agree, some of the items are fashion-forward, but it's exactly what knitting should be about. Teva's designs have always been fresh and forward thinking, and her book is absolutely outstanding! This book was definitely well worth the wait!"
5,"Excellent designs, skip the author's musings","This is a fantastic book with beautiful patterns. I have really enjoyed the pieces I've made from here and I always find the designs and photography inspiring.However, I do not like the ridiculously pretentious sections of musings by the author. Skip the flighty text and just stick to the designs."
2,Very strange....,"If you like funky styles, this book maybe for you. The models look scary and the styles are from outerspace. This book does not inspire or entice you to knit anything in it. There are so many other really good knitting books out there. I don't get it....and neither should you...."
5,FABIO,"IF YOU LIKE MICAEL FRANKS, YOU'LL LOVE FABIO CONCATO.HE WAS THE FIRST SONGWRITER TO WRIGHT A SONG DEDICATED TO ABUSED CHILDREN.HIS MUSIC IS RELAXING AND THE SMOOTHNESS WAY HE SINGS HIS SONGS,EXCEPTIONALLY WELL WRITTEN IS UNIQUE THESE DAYS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM."
3,"I'd give it a ""C""","The first 45 minutes had all the excitement of a Beverly Hills 90210 episode. Maybe not that much. When the main guy goes to bury his dead girlfriend and lo-and-behold finds another dead body in the ditch he's just dug, you know believablity is not going to be a high point in this movie. The series of unbeleivable scenarios is just beginning to unfold however, and at a rate that's much quicker than the first 45 minutes. The unbeleivablity would have been more forgivable if other elements had been more interesting, but those other elements were missing for me. OK, the second half was at least an improvement on the first in terms of generating interest. Not a terrible movie, but not a great one either."
1,expensive,"so very expensive, but necessary in order to operate blue air purifiers. they sure got you by the balls with this thing. if i had known i'd be spending money on filters, i never would've got this brand."
5,does the job right,"The filter is a bit pricy, but definitely does the job well. the filter can last a lot longer than what the manufacturer recommends. Don't get sucked in by their marketing, one can easily double the filter change interval. If you only leave the fan at lowest speed, the filter probably can last for years with good efficiency."
5,"Best prices, original manufacturer","I love the Air purifier, my Daughter has allergies and it really does make it easier for her to breath, if you buy the replacement filters from the manufactures website they are much more money....so,I bought this filter because it was way less money. This is the same filter offered on the manufacturers website, and it is MUCH cheaper bought here."
4,Works well but pricey,The only reason for 4 stars is that the price keeps going up and they are very pricey. They work very well at keeping the air clean.
2,blueair 402,"look at this filter-""paper""-a little screen/cardboard/lettering-cost to manufacture?cost to replace?come on-50 bucks plus?-long live capitalism(?)-you are paying for it-sucker-watch ""the Corporation""on dvd or free netflix instant watch-learn-grow your mind-don't be a typical american dolt"
5,A PRODUCT THAT WORKS.,"I was surprised and not happy when I first looked into air purifiers and found the one recommended most often --Blueair--used filters that cost about $50 and had to be replaced every 6 months. That was a few years ago. Since then, I have not begrudged one dime of what I have spent for replacement filters. I have pets that shed, I live in Manhattan on a street that has been worked on constantly, creating lots of airborne dirt, and my building was repointed a couple years ago, providing more of the same. And I have allergies.But I sleep well every night and wake up without a stuffy nose. These filters work, and so does the purifier-- as well as the day I first turned it on. So far it has outlived both the clock radio and a tower fan."
3,the worm shall squirm,someone had written in book. i did not know that per the ad. otherwise the book was in good shape
5,Jumpin' Country!!,Love the way words are played in this song-the music was fresh-amixture of several genres. I would encourage people to buy it. I also loved the video-those ladies are hot!!
5,Wow! What a great song!!,"THis is a great song! I like all the list of the things she did when she left, for ex. how she took his favorite Dodger's hat and the T.V. Good luck, and hurry up and release the SHeBAng Cd!!"
5,Bratz: The Video Game!,"First of all, I bouth the PC Game.Don't listen to the bad rewiews of thies game! This is actually, a GREAT and FUN game to play.The people who say is boring, that is because they don't know how to play it! and don't know how to ""UNLOCK"" another lever!All you need is PRACTICE! I just bouth it today at only 9.99$ in Canadian dollars plus taxes.I didn't think it was fun at first, but then I keep on playing and playing until I have ""UNLOCK"" another lever!You just need PATIENT with this game to make it FUN!Each time you playing good and nice, you get the chance to ""UNLOCK"" another lever.I bouth a used one, the person who bouth it, must returned it because she or he didn't know how to play and ""UNLOCK"" another level!I did play nicely and patiently, until I have ""UNLOCK"" another level!I am a HUGE Bratz fan. So I think this game is a must have!REMEMBER YOU NEED PATIENT to make this game FUN!Lots Of Love,Fulliem XOXOXOXOXOXO"
3,not for younger players,"When I bought this used game from a store. The clerk told me the mother sold this game and said it was terrible. I wondered why? When I played it, I noticed the player have to play well to unlock all 10 songs. Or else, you can only dance along with 1 song. The previous owner didn't play well enough to unlock any songs, but only playing the same 1 songs. It was kind a fun once you are able to play it. I was able to dance along with the arrows and unlock all songs. But I have to agree with some buyers, that this game is not suitable to younger kids as it is not an easy game to play. Needed lots of practice, but what if you get bore with only 1 song, will you still practice? It's personal choice. I hope this will help others to consider before purchase the game. I do enjoy it though."
1,Bratz,I can't say weather I like the game or not. You see I ordered this game back in Dec. for my child for christmas and to date It has not been shipped. I live in Canada and it does say they can only ship in Canada. I don't understan it . Three and 1/2 months and my child is still with out the game. I think she will like it when and if it ever gets here. She runs to the post office every day but no package yet. I feel that the public needs to know that you can order but you never know when you will get the game you want.
3,HARD TO PLAY,"My husband and I bought this game for our 6 year old daughter. We cannot figure out how to play!!!We are new to the whole gameboy world, we bought game for Tiffany's 6th birthday. Oh well,maybe we can figure it out. We have all 3 became addicted!!!"
4,The Best Video Game Ever,"This video game is the best!!! If you love Bratz and if you love dancing and music than this is the perfect gift for you. And you could also pick an outfit for the Bratz (I didn't know which one to choose!) Girls you're crazy if you don't have this. And don't worry if you don't have a GameBoy this game is also on PS2 and GameCube. Here's my point, You'd love this!!!!!"
5,Pokemon Sapphire,This game was just as excellent as the other Pokemon games have been. Ths so far is the best game in the Pokemon line.
4,Art & History of Sicily,"My 85 yr. old mom & I (American born)drove all over Sicily, our native land. We enjoyed using this book , not as a guide, but as a resource to give us some background on the historic sights we chose to see. We also shared it with our relatives in Tortorici(near Messina)who have never wandered away from their tiny hillside town. We then sent it to my uncle in upstate New York who did not believe that there were Greek ruins in Sicily. We got our money's worth out of that book!"
2,Needs a new name,How a book called Art & History of Sicily can address a place still so influenced by the Golden Era of the Normans with only *one* detail from *one* 12th Century manuscript illumination is beyond me. As a pretty travel log it is worth the price but as an art book or a history book it is superficial at best.
3,Not a keeper,I bought this book but it is not one of my favorite and not one that I need to keep in my collection. I was just bored with it and didn't really find any point to the story.
2,"a short book against the theology of Richard Bach's ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull""","I got a copy of this as a free cast-off from a university library, read it, and gave it away to a friend who's a theology professor.Being so short, this book takes less than half an hour to read. It's a polemic against Richard Bach's 1970 bestseller ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"". The author alleges that Bach's book was probably the result of satanic visions. This thin premise doesn't really go anywhere; it's all just an excuse for this little theological tract. The author didn't fancy the idea that some readers (and Richard Bach himself) saw JLS as a Christian allegory, or at least didn't fancy some of that allegory's thrust...so, the attempt is made here to launch a cultural counter-strike against JLS's popularity and acceptance.As a sermon or two, this book is probably fine. The early 1970s were what they were."
2,An appealing title. A disappointing study,"Professor of New Testament and Early Judaism in the University of Tubingen, the author is keen on cohering Paul's own declarations with the accounts given in Acts. He necessarily brushes aside contemporary scholarship that sees more literature than history in Luke's Acts. By doing so, his presupposition leads him to anchor Paul's training in Jerusalem. He also considers that the earliest Christian community was a hellenistic one, rivalling in the Jerusalem synagogues, explaining that their foremost member, Stephan, angered the Jews who stoned him. Paul carries on the pogrom in Jerusalem and then in Damascus before his revelation of Christ who abrogates the Law. Not surprisingly, Hengel holds that Augustine and Luther were the only ones to fully understand Paul. The book is a short apologetic essay full of twists to level the difficulties."
2,Needed more thought in the design,"The problem with this colander is that all of the holes are located in the very bottom portion, which is made of hard plastic. The Squish brand makes similar collapsible colanders, but they have managed to make them with a couple of rows of holes on the sides, in addition to the ones in the bottom. That design simply works better. Yes, the Squish versions tend to be a bit more pricey, but in this case, I think they are worth it."
3,Fine while it lasted,"I got this colander as a wedding gift a few years ago, and I really liked it. Being collapsible made it easy to fit into cupboards and the dishwasher, and it is a great size. However, I recently discovered a several inch tear in one of the creases where it collapses. I'm hesitant to buy another one because the same thing could happen again."
4,"Sturdy, Well Made...","I use this product in my kitchen constantly and only have two complaints... Number one, It doesn't collapse as thin as I would like. Number two, it doesn't collapse as easily as I would like. Sometimes it is kind of hard to get it to work. However, this product is very sturdy and I am sure it will last me for years. It takes a little more cabinet space than I would like, but all around it is a great thing to own."
3,Hard to collapse,"This collapsable collander has a nice big capacity, but the blue flexible side - the part that's collapsible - is pretty rigid and you have to wrestle with it. Opening is even harder than collapsing. Also, all of the holes are in the white piece at the bottom, so the draining is slow going. If I'd seen it in person before purchasing, I probably would have chosen something else."
5,"Sturdy, Easy to Store Colander","I bought this colander to replace a plastic colander that cracked. We use it daily. The silicone material is very durable and crack-resistant. During garden season, we fill it to overflowing with produce from the garden. The wide rim provides for efficient handling. It collapses easily for space-saving storage and uncollapses with little effort. I heartily recommend this product."
3,"great idea, hard to execute","Love the compactness of this product. However, I've found it difficult to un-collapse it. Maybe with more use it will get easier."
2,Not as pictured,"Like the other review said, not tightly woven as in the photo, but very flimsy and bigger open squares. Was going to stencil them with camp name, but can't do it on these. We'll see how they hold up to traffic at cabins at a summer camp."
2,Uniden DX1986-2C 900 MHz Cordless Phone - Not Good,"This phone was uncomfortable to use. I bought it because of good Consumer Reports ratings. In addition to being uncomfortable, it was too easy to disconnect accidentally.Worst, after only a few weeks, the phone began cutting out after about 20 minutes of use. Unplugging the phone was the only solution. I've given up and gotten another phone."
1,1 star because I cant give it zero,"This is the worst anthology or compilation ever produced. My biggest regret is not having listened to the previous reviewers who it said it stunk. It's bad old interviews that skip around and have no real point or ending; mixed with old video clips. There are many better video documentaries, but never before has anyone compiled a load of trash like this... Kudos on your lack of hard work, poor editing and overall waste of your time and mine- PLEASE safe your money and time... don't do what I did and watch this."
2,Each chapter leaves an unpleasant ring behind,"Mr Mermelstein has selected to lard his speech with words from every recess of the English language (a Webster was necessary to keep alongside of his book). Mr Mermelstein also does not write one single passage without boasting his own excellence. However some interesting facts are gathered in this book, so if you can stand the braging - read it!"
3,MSD Mini-Crimper Review,"The MSD Mini Crimper does what it says. I only had 4 wires to crimp and it took about 20 minutes to complete. If you are handeling ignition wires all day long or for a career, this is not the proper tool. It is made of plastic and I can not see it's usefull lifespan as more then 2 wire sets. You get what you pay for."
4,Irish magic,"The Corrs, though hugely successful in their native Ireland and throughout Asia, have only now broken into the American market with their stunning new set 'In Blue'. Yet listeners who are only now beginning to discover the quartet, should immediately get their hands on this limited edition CD of the Corrs live in performance.While none of the songs here relate to the tracks on 'In Blue', this is the group at its' unadorned best, with the lead singer's voice weaving its usual magic. It also broke new ground, as it showed the band to be musicians, as well as singers. Indeed, all four of them play their own instruments, and on one particular instrumental piece on the album, its all too obvious that these are musicians who know what they're doing. Which is a good thing for us, the listeners, I think."
2,Trying to get to the plot,"I have read some of Joseph's books, but was entirely bogged down in this. I found it to be very verbose. I can manage some descriptions but felt this was entirely overdone. I am only 25% through the story and can barely find the plot among all the words. I am not sure I will complete it, although from previous reviews it appears to be worthwhile. I'm not certain I will make it."
2,Very weak book from a very strong writer,I have read several of Joseph Conrad's books. I was very disappointed with this one. It was difficult to follow the action. The characters were 2 dimensional. The only good part was the usual Conrad capture of place.
4,Lingards Dilemna,"The familiar Conrad hero Captain Tom Lingard(Outcast of the Islands) comes to the rescue of an English pleasure yacht that has foundered in the shallows just as war is about to break out between Malay tribes. Tom has war supplies including gunpowder stored in his own boat that has been turned into a fort and Tom's decisions will greatly effect the outcome of the war. Meanwhile though there is the English problem which Tom sees as being just that until he spies on board a lovely woman. Thats enough to distract our hero from his more pressing war time duties. Romantic Tom recalls Lord Jim and is in fact Jims brother, but he is not as complex or as troubled as Jim was so this is more a tale of pure adventure. External events take precedence over internal conflicts and so the adventure can be enjoyed for just that. Not one of Conrads most important works but still it exerts a lot of appeal. Anything by the best writer ever of sea and island tales is worth my time."
2,Could not get into the reading of this book,"This was a very painful book to read through. It may be enjoyed by someone, but it never struck my fancy. It was about sea faring ships of old that never got out of the bay, in my eyes."
1,Not the best use of my time,"I tried really hard to finish this book, but I just couldn't--it moved too slowly for my taste. I hardly ever give up on a book, but I just couldn't spend any more time on it. I'm sure it would be of interest to someone, but that someone is not me."
3,good read,Good read any Nicholas sparks book is worth the read.... I highly suggest this book.. I really enjoyed this book
2,Just didn't click,Not every highly touted author can be successful with all readers. Conrad's writing style didn't pull me into the story let alone keep me interested.
2,Highly Disappointing for an APP Effort,"For years I listened almost exclusively to what I consider the very best of the Alan Parsons Project's albums ~ Pyramid, Eye in the Sky, Eve, Turn of a Friendly Card, I Robot ~ so I purchased Gaudi expecting more of the same. I have to say I'm highly disappointed in it. In fact, after listening to it just once or twice when I first bought it, 6 or 7 years ago, it sat on my shelf until just this past week. After listening again, I found only one track good enough to write home about, the rest mostly a jumble. Definitely NOT the theme-based set from start to finish, which is what I came to expect from APP after all those wonderful earlier albums. I disliked Gaudi so much that I've given it away to a thrift shop. If you loved their earlier work, don't bother with this one."
1,Extended version?,For some reason they thought that adding the preliminary demos would be a benefit to this album. Be wary if you buy this album and only want the original tracks.
2,Like Sagrada Familia - incomplete. Unlike it - kinda dull.,"There are really only two (well, three, if you count the reprise) high points on this album: ""La Sagrada Familia"" and ""Standing On Higher Ground."" Most of the rest of the work is theme-based in theory, but seems unfocused and actually rather dull. ""Inside Looking Out"" is a snooze-fest that ends in a babble of voices leading into the repise of ""Sagrada,"" and ""Money Talks"" doubles down on the Pink Floyd references (and is not even remotely close to being as good or imaginative as the original ""Money""). If you can get the three good cuts elsewhere, go ahead and get them and leave the rest of it; you're not missing much."
3,"Good, but the weak points are really glaring","I did not have high expectations for this album. After all, the ""pre-breakup"" album from bands are usually pretty bad, given that the tensions are already there. That being said, it opened up very strong, with ""La Sagrada Familia"". From there, though, much of the album was dissappointing, and felt like a collection of generic APP songs. The final tune, which was more of a reprise of La Sagrada Familia than anything else, stood out well. More songs like that would have made this a four star disc, and without them it would have been a two star disc.J.Ja"
1,bad DVD was created from a VHS,"This DVD is awful it is shaky at the beginning and blurry throughout the rest of it. Annette Kowalski has a greenish color casting around her body very distracting. Not worth the money. The other Bob Ross -Annette Kowalski is worst yet, I would say a good 80-90% of that one is very bright white so you don't see much. Not worth time or money"
5,Beautiful,"Not to be one of those people that spouts benedictions about this book from everywhere, but this is a truly amazing book. The artwork, and especially the coloring is stunning. The story is nicely paced with action and suspense, along with ammusing little plot twists thrown in. Seeing as this is only the first half of the entire TELLOS run, it'll make you want to run out and buy the next one to see the end of the saga. Its fantasy elements make the strangest things possible and believable. This is the kind of story telling that I've ever read comics for."
2,bottle adapter,did not do what i expected it to do. looking for some thing to fit my backpacking stove for propane bottles.
4,Works great,"Purchased as a gift, works very well but was a pain to get batteries into, kept jamming up the grinder as I was securing the batteries. Works great now"
5,great pepper mill - shaker,great product. we purchased the salt shaker just like this and are very happy with both. they are so convientent and look really nice.
2,Mine stopped working too,"I loved this pepper mill while it worked, but like other reviewers, mine stopped working after 7 months of use."
5,Bought for a shower gift,Bought this for a shower gift and she absolutely loved it. She said it works really well and looks attractive by her stove.
1,Trudeau Pepper Mill,"We loved this mill until the second refill. At that point, it quit working. We can feel and hear the motor turning, but nothing comes out."
1,broke after less than 2 months,I was really excited about getting a new electric pepper mill. The one I had previously lasted almost 4 years and was a complete workhorse. This one seemed to have good reviews so I went with it. At first it worked great but batteries died quickly (I had to replace them 3 times in less than 2 months). Then it all of a sudden decided to stop working all together. What a drag...and of course now its past the return period so im stuck with a crappy pepper mill that doesn't work anymore. Thumbs down on the Trudeau.
1,"WORTHLESS, DO NOT BUY","THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS ONE STAR IS BECAUSE ZERO DIDN'T SEEM TO BE AN OPTION. THE BOTTOM WAS DIFFICULT TO REMOVE AND CLOSE TO INSTALL THE BATTERIES. BUT THE WORST THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT JUST DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL, BARELY WORKS AT ALL. WHEN ADJUSTED FOR A FINE GRIND, NOTHING CAME OUT. WHEN ADJUSTED FOR A COARSE GRIND, AN OCCASIONAL BIG CHUNK CAME OUT. NOW I HAVE TO GO TO THE HASSLE AND EXPENSE OF RETURNING IT. SINGLE MOST WORTHLESS PRODUCT I'VE BOUGHT FROM AMAZON EVER. I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BUY THIS NAME BRAND OF ANYTHING AGAIN."
4,great product,Fantastic pepper grinder!!! The only problem was that it was a little difficult to put the peppercorns and batteries in. I accidentally got a peppercorn stuck in the center hole and it took me a while to dig it out.
5,Ideal for anyone with limited finger strength,"I'm a black pepper junkie, and I'm also a C6 quadriplegic with a weak grip. This grinder turns on automatically when you upend it, and its wide rubberized base makes it very easy to hold, so it's perfect for my kitchen. I'm ordering another one as a backup, because I know I'm going to use this one so often that it'll grind itself into oblivion long before my appetite for pepper is satisfied."
2,Seizes in High Humidity,"If you live in a climate w/o humidity, this works really well. Otherwise the salt locks the motor to the shaft that turns grinding the salt and the whole thing seizes and becomes nearly impossible to fix. After trying to force the motor out (motor is supposed to disconnect from the shaft in order to refill) with no success, I eventually filled it with hot water from the top, allowing the salt to dissolve enough to separate the pieces. I have the matching pepper grinder and this problem doesn't occur (which I assume b/c pepper is not water soluble). After separating and drying thoroughly I tried it again, and now it's locked up for a second time. Worked will in the Pacific Northwest, but not in the South.FYI - The ""chrome finish"" is 100% plastic. Still looks pretty nice, but there's no metal on it anywhere."
2,"Started out great, then fizzled out","At first, I would have definitely given this pepper grinder 5 stars. It was nice to have an electric pepper grinder that is easy to utilize with one hand while cooking. I liked how you could chose the fineness of the ground pepper that comes out....That being said, filling it is rather awkward and messy. You must take out the battery pack to add the peppercorns, and once it is screwed back into place, it turns on and grinds until flipped over. After one refill, the battery pack ""handle"" itself broke, so that it would not pull out easily. We were able to ""fix"" it, but every time we had to refill it, it would break again. Then the 3rd time we refilled it, the battery pack got stuck, and since the handle was broken off of it, I couldn't get it out. I tapped it lightly on the counter and the whole thing just fell apart!"
5,Great Dining Table Gadget,This pepper grinder is economical and does everything that would be expected from an electric pepper grinder. I use it both in the kitchen and on the dining table. The range of grind adjustment is satisfactory for everything I cook and eat.
5,They are great!,"We bought two of the black, one for salt & one for pepper. You can see thru the container so it doesn't matter that both are black. They are very easy to use and to adjust the grind. It's a bit tricky filling them at first (I made a mess) but now have the hang of it and it's easy. It's very handy to have fresh ground salt and pepper with only one hand and fresh ground tastes so much better! The containers are very attractive too."
4,So far so good,It has worked as advertised. The adjustability of the grind is lacking but other than that I am happy with it.I would recommend it to family and friends.
4,"Worth it, but could be better.","I would only point out two real flaws in this item.1) It uses 6 AAA batteries. 6 is a weird number. You can't get 6-packs of batteries, and chargers generally handle 4 or 8 AAAs. Also AAAs are far more expensive than AAs for the power. A power pack for these which used 4 AAs would have been much better all around.2) It does not mark or indicate the grind size in any way. You have to either eye the separation of the grind gap, or grind a bit, then adjust.I would also say that it takes a moment to see how to load this thing (or change the batteries) without grinding some pepper - the trick is not to tighten the bottom on until you turn it back right-side-up. This isn't really a problem, though.Overall though, these are great, and certainly worth the money.Also, this ""Elite"" version is worth the extra money over the non-""Elite"" one."
3,Had it for over a year - Excellent but it just died,"I really like this one. Looked good, worked good and the price was right. If you know anything about electronics, motors consume batteries fast. The battery life was acceptable. Lasted over a year and it just quit. Sounds like an internal gear stripped. You can hear the motor buzzing but has no traction to spin the mill. ;-(No replacement parts available so I guess I'll be looking for something else."
5,Best Gift!,I gave this to a friend for her birthday last month...I promise you there is not a day that goes by that she does not say something about how much she loves it! Thanks for such a wonderful product.
3,Grind adjustment stopped working,"I really liked my Trudeau Graviti Pepper Mill until the grind adjustment stopped working. I used it happily for about 2 months when the adjustment dial jammed. I was disappointed to find the order was officially 30 days past the Amazon posted return-by date, but called anyway and was very pleasantly suprised to find a replacement will be shipped out promptly. Thank you Amazon! I appreciate the great service. My fingers are crossed that this second mill will work well as it has for many reviewers. There are a few who reported having the same issue I did, so apparently the design and/or manufacturing is somewhat problematic. We'll see. If this one works I'll order another for salt."
2,Lightweight,Handy item....but feels a bit cheap. Stainless steel finish on plastic? Plastic just does not belong on quality kitchen products.
1,Non operating Trudeau Elite Graviti Pepper Mill,"The product worked for approximately one month and then it stopped operating when tilted to discharge the pepper. I have changed the batteries twice, but to no avail. I also found that the bottom cover could not be fastened securely to the body of the shaker. I have taken the drive from the salt shaker and found that it works in the pepper shaker. The bottom cover, however, still remained a problem. I would like to negotiate an exchange if possible."
2,Poor Workmanship Poor Design,The concept is inticing however the execution in assembly and the overall design is poor. I purchased this for my 80+ old mother to make it easier to spice her food. First the six required AA batteries is ridiculous and it worked only intermittently. Returned product and to Amazon's credit received full refund.
2,Two Year Life Span,"This is a nice pepper grinder, but after two years it quit guinding. So, if you are looking for something that lasts, don't purchase."
1,Does not work,What a waste of money! I purchased this for my mother and it doesn't work.. I don't Know how it received this high review rate on amazon!
2,Cheap poor quality grinder,This is a pretty cheaply made grinder with an awkward design: The peppercorns fall out as you have to get past them to the batteries. The previous models were well made and could stand the test of time. I would not order this item again.
5,Fire truck,"I bought this for my grandson when he was 3 years old. It was one of his favorite toys. He's almost 5 now, but he still plays with it."
2,??,"Not the product that was in the picture. The picture showed the compete set, however only one replacment wire came. Not good advertisement will b returning."
3,Not the best...,The product is the not as nice as I expected it to be but for a beginner it will do the trick! Thanks.
4,YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN....,"WOW, AFTER HEARING ""MARIA"", THE FIRST RELEASE OFF THE NEW CD ""NO EXIT"" I RUSHED OUT TO BE THE FIRST TO GET IT. WELL, I LOVE IT ! I HAVE T ADMIT THAT IT DID TAKE ME A WHILE TO GET INTO THE BLONDIE SOUND AGAIN, AFTER ALL IT HAS BEEN OVER 10 YEARS SINCE BLONDIE HAS RELEASED ANY MUSIC. BUT AFTER I GOT BACK INTO MY BLONDIE MODE, I FEEL THAT I HAVE GONE FULL CIRCLE W/ THE BAND. THEY JUST PROVE THAT YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN. IF YOUR A TRUE BLONDIE FAN, YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY THIS ONE TO COMPLETE YOUR COLLECTION.SIT BACK AND OPEN YOUR MIND ......AND ENJOY!"
2,"""Maria"" great song- terrible remix",The song is one of the best of Blondie's catalog- but this remix is such a disappointment. Totally undanceable and unlistenable... Thank Goodness the Album version is on the CD single... Blondie should have had more control of this CD release.....
5,Ave Maria,"Absolute perfection, Debbie Harry has proven that unlike some 50 somethings she can still put out a great tune. If you don't like this then boy you have a problem. Classic Blondie at their best."
1,DO NOT BUY,i would give this cd zero stars if i could. THe song maria isn't that good and the remixes are terrible. the band Blondie is a good band but the song MAria is terrrible DONT BUY
5,Great,"The authors have done a magnificent job of finding and revealing the recently declassifed top secret government documents from the Manhattan Project that tell the truth about how we have been deceived by our government and organizations like the ADA, CDC, EPA, USPHS,etc. The authors reveal, with documentation, the history of how the lies and deceit have been promulgated through the years by the so called self appointed and self proclaimed experts with the help of Edward Bernays, well know as the ""Father of Spin""."
2,Anecdotal Pseudo-Science,"Naysayer conspiracy theorist using mostly outlier science, half-truths and anecdotal quotes from a few disgruntled scientists, taken out of context. Same type of book written by those who deny global warming, evolution, etc. Poorly written, author repeats himself endlessly. Save your money."
5,Riveting!,"Wow!In this riveting book, Christopher Bryson skillfully connects the dots in exposing a 60 year old cover-up by industry giants designed to avoid mounting litigation related to fluoride--a major workplace poison--and reveals how public opinion was engineered to embrace this toxic substance as the panacea for tooth decay.With more than 100 pages of supportive documentation Bryson spotlights the long-hidden truth, some of which he uncovered in recently declassified government files, showing that fluoride's harm to human health was well known before the start of fluoridation in 1945.The shocking facts in this powerful book should rightfully enrage and catapult a largely unsuspecting public into action against this ill advised practice; one that has been banned or rejected by 98% of medically advanced countries."
1,Poor Quality,Seams coming apart after two washings!! I bought two and one has unequal top panels that are sewn together to make a lop sided top. Look elsewhere.
5,"well-made, medium-weight cloth","I'm pleased with this bandanna, which I use while riding my motorcycle. It fits well, and seems well made. The cloth is not as heavy as another Zan Headgear bandanna I bought (the Woodland Camo one), so it's cooler, but might not last as long as the Woodland one."
1,"Cheap product, not quality workmanship","We just ordered one and got it today. Super thin cheap material - not using good bandannas to make these from, crooked sewing, raw edges of the material left to fray, some of the seams are just a knotted mess of thread where the machine messed up and they just left it, material panels are even and the gathers at the back of the head are different sizes as well."
4,Thick Bandanna!,It's a nice think bandana for the price. Mine did not have any misaligned panels or threads hanging. Will need to wait until after a couple of washings to see if it deserves 5 stars.
1,You get what you pay for....,One washing and it almost disintegrated. Colors also faded - it aged one year after one washing. Enuff said - stay away.
4,Bandanna,this is made well enough for me. It is designed to absorb well and does the job for what it is intended
4,Sunny days,"I use this Flydanna for running. It is great for keeping the sun off my head, and the sweat out of my eyes."
5,Buena compra,"Economica, bonita, comoda, el material es muy delgado, hay que tratar con mucho cuidado....creo que comprare más"
4,Childhood Remembered,"I'm so glad they put Galaxy Rangers on DVD. Now, I can finally prove to my friends that I'm not senile and that this show did in fact exist! Yes!"
3,Not Bad,"This wasn't a bad book, just not interesting enough for me to keep or read again.Tess believes she is unable to get pregnant. Her self-centered niece (Chloe) has asked her to take care of her son (Ben). But soon, Tess falls in love with Ben and she is a loving and devoted mother to the point where everyone thinks Ben is her child. But disaster strikes when Chloe decides she wants back Ben back, Tess's friend Rafe decides that the only option is for he and Tess to get married so that she has a shot at custody.This actually would have been a good read had it not been for all the bickering. It was incessant. In the bedroom, they're great, out of it I could only wonder that they'd actually been friends for years.As I said, not bad, but not great. If given the option, I wouldn't recommend."
5,Great collection of songs,"It took me a long time to get this one, but it was well worth the wait. I knew and loved 'Solo', but hadn't heard any of the other tracks. All are just great and stand up to repeated listening. Sandy was just wonderful."
4,Hidden goodies in this album,"Most might look at the cover art and decide not to buy this album/cd, but that would be a mistake. One of the best performances by Sandy Denny ever, ""No End,"" is on this album, and the song I like best, an old standard, ""Until the Real Thing Comes Along,"" positively swings. And who would want to pass up the great guitar riff by Richard Thompson, which is pure musical bonus? This review is short , but I recommend this album, and you will find your own favorites in it soon enough."
3,Todd Solondz's first; funny but nowhere near his later stuff,"""Fear, Anxiety, Depression"" is writer/director Todd Solondz's debut and the only film of his which he stars in. It's funny but nowhere near as interesting/effective as his later works. It's funny, but not particularly insightful and Solondz, despite his zany appearance, hasn't the charisma to carry the film. It's also notable for appearances by Stanley Tucci and the late Second City vet J.J. Barry as Ira's always bellowing father. The film tanked and even Solondz wasn't so pleased with it, causing him to ditch showbiz altogether for several years. Still, it's not a total washout. This was really just a minor taste of what he is capable of."
4,his best film,it's not perfect - but a great first feature. tucci is hilarious.todd should lighten up and release this thing.
5,Paul Desmond's music is...simply eargasmic,"As a kid in the 60's, I'd could wake up on an Saturday morning to his Easy Living LP(or Gerry Mulligan's What Is There To Say?). Mom would enjoy his music as she prepared breakfast; usually the smell from pancakes sizzling on a griddle, and bacon frying next to it...ok, ok you get the picture. That was an important time for me, I was being exposed to Jazz, the music that my parents liked. Moments ago, I listened to Mr. Desmond play on Bossa Antigua, the pitch and tone coming out of his horn was indescribably sweet, it was euphoric.Jazz music has been the greatest influence on my listening choices. Does anyone remember one of my favorites: A Child's Introduction to JAZZ as narrated by CANNONBALL ADDERLEY?"
3,A somewhat chastened reviewer...,"A good friend reminded me that Elis Regina played an electric guitar on the Jobim-Regina version of ""Aguas De Marco"". So, out the window goes the blanket statement made below...but my point is still in force. Elis - after I listened well to her electric playing - still gets away with it simply because she has that SOMETHING - the authentic rhythm comes through. As I said, I really like Hall, but the rhythm doesn't happen on the electric on this recording. Again, perhaps that was not a consideration, but I do stand corrected about at least Regina's electricity!"
2,Not nuts about the flavor.,"Pretty salty, BBQ seasoning is very messy and has settled during shipping. Very hard to close the resealable bags."
1,Spit Happens!,Used my copy as a recycled napkin baby's bib in 1870's. Frozen Glass Pop's only for grownups.
4,happy with the book but:,"i was happy with the book and the phonetic structure that gives you an idea of how the words are pronounced. i have a problem learning a new language and this book makes it easier. the spanish version already has a home in my library and has been very helpful. however, i was disappointed when i put it in my cd player and got no response. i didn't realize that it was a cd rom and not a regular cd."
5,Extremely Useful and Enjoyable,"I have traveled to St. Martin the past three years and decided to learn beginning French to increase my enjoyment of visits to the French side of the island.For a beginner, this book is very effective. It is set up in small manageable segments to cover roughly 25 different topics (key questions, numbers, days and time, key verbs, family members, menu items, etc.).I like the concept of spending 10 - 15 minutes everyday (although there are numerous segments that take much more than 10 minutes to learn). I especially like the English pronunciation that is shown above the French words during each lesson to assist proper pronunciation.I supplement this book with audio-cassette series from Pimsleur Language Series and a Random House French-English and English-French dictionary. I find ""French in 10 Minutes a Day"" is a very helpful complement to the cassettes.I would recommend ""French in 10 Minutes a Day"" as a helpful workbook to a motivated beginner."
3,Overpriced,"This card is decent but not great. I found that the ultra edition is somewhat overrated. For the price, you only get maybe 5% boost from the GTX model and the GT model is almost $240 dollar cheaper and it runs about %8 slower but 10-15 C* cooler. This card is huge! If you don't have a good airflow computer case i would recommend you getting one of those pci slot fan if not your computer is just going to be a heater."
4,"A great old method, better than newer titles","While not perfect, this is a great method. It is a notation focused traditional approach, but features a lot of 12-bar blues/rock type bits and such. It gets better into the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th books. The newest edition of the Alfred's Basic Guitar Method and other titles from Alfred actually use a lot of pieces from this old method. The new edition books add up to a worse method though. I'm very happy this is still in print, and this is one of my go-to methods for teaching notation for guitarists of any interest. Please buy this and not the newer Alfred books."
2,I think I don't get it,"Being a long time fan of Richard and Linda Thompson, and enjoying, too, Liege and Lief by Fairport Convention, I honestly tried to love that one .. but well, I really couldn't. I can't stand her voice, which (I think) lacks light & shade. I wish I was a fool for you is in fact a cover of the Thompson's for shame of doing wrong. I love the original version and couldn't get into this one - it's so weak. I like the song I am a dreamer and could sell my soul for the L. Thompson's cover version, but not for the Sandy Denny original one ! I have an idea that on the whole, Sandy Denny was a bit overrated - both her voice and music. If you like great folk voices, then I'd advise you go for Maddy Prior or Linda Thompson insteadBut again, maybe I just don't get it. I'm sure many ""folkies"" will have a very different opinion !!"
2,"Fast-moving plot, thankfully","This really wasn't my type of book. It's an interesting premise, and I had heard various people recommend it, but it left me with a blah feeling. It is a fairly engaging adventure, and it's kinda fun following people through the story. But a lot of the stuff was really quite routine, and partially due to the fantastic nature of the book, a lot of it just seemed outlandish, even reading in a huh-wouldn't-it-be-interesting-if-this-happened mindset. It probably was not my cup of tea, but I was glad for the fast-moving plot: I was able to get on to another book as quickly as possible."
4,Faith put to the test,"Wil's Bones is a somewhat disturbing and thought provoking book, pitting political intrigue against fundamental Christian beliefs. Dr. Wilson's goal in life is to prove his dead alcoholic and abusive father's relgious beliefs to be a sham. Wil's apparent triumph sets wheels in motion that could lead to incomprehensible world wide changes and his death. A cat and mouse game ensues with Wil trying to stay alive while seeking answers to deep secrets. The book is a fast read with several sub-plots tossed in, including a romance. What ever your beliefs, this book will make you think."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"The most laughably written, most preposterous story line and the most contrived book I have ever read. No thinking person, let alone someone who can read, should be caught dead with this pathetic tale. Although I read it about 2 years ago, I still cringe at the memory of it. Just awful."
5,Wil's Bones,This was a phenomenal book. It grabs your attention and doesn't let go. You will find it very difficult to put down. The story is intriguing and entertaining. I am anxiously awaiting his next book.Esther
4,Thought Provoking,I found the book interesting and very thought provoking. I'm surprised that someone out there hasn't made the preposterous claim of finding the bones of Jesus.
4,Fast-paced & easy to read. A very enjoyable novel!,"While it may not be the most thought-provoking piece of literature you'll read, Wil's Bones provides a engaging look at how the world would be affected if Jesus' bones really were discovered. The character detail isn't too deep, and the story premise and love story are basic, but on the whole it is very effective, and I'm looking forward to reading Kevin Bowen's next novel, if he ever does write one."
5,Free speech,"This movie shows blatantly the all importance of free speech and the panicky fear of the powerful for it.Free speech can (and should) reveal inconvenient truths (the `real world'), and it could (should) effectively undermine the power base of vested interests. That is also the reason why those vested interests control nearly all media outlets.In this movie, those in power (local business interests) were trying by ALL means to prevent a speech (only that!) at a college hall by a democrat (also Democrat), in the person of movie director and social agitator Michael Moore. They were afraid that he could influence public opinion (an overwhelming majority for the RP) and change the political majority and its agenda, although the chances were practically inexistent.As Saint Augustine said: `Men love truth when it bathes them in its light; they hate it when it proves them wrong.'This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in."
4,How and Why Fascism Arises by 'Good Germans',"wow. it's been so long since 1939 and kristallnacht we all forget the mood of the german people prior to the nazi takeover, but here is the psychology all over again displayed as clear as day in this film: the 'good germans' just wanting to maintain the purity of their race, and so imposing the constriction of society and the ostracizing of the other and the tyranny of the narrow minded. Look at how the wealthy ignoramuses in America get to impose their will on everyone else. Look at the willfully ignorant anti-intellectual celebrities like Hannity jeering on the crowds to persecute the liberals. It is all here. Will it get worse? Not if we get a few more Michael Moores to fight for the real America."
4,Mostly good,"Good piece, well-done EXCEPT: If we're going to be filmmakers, children, let's learn to mic someone for an interview. If I was producing this, I would've kicked about 1/3 of those interviews back for sound bad enough to require subtitles.Audio Technica PRO88W-R35 VHF Wireless Microphone System for Camcorder Use"
5,Fan of Basquiat...loved it,Purchased as a Christmas gift for a friend that is a big fan. He loved it. The dialog and art was great.
3,Alas,"I have played in this musical as Mr. Butler in comunity theatre 3 times, and once we played this revival technically illegally. And dispite that this show is a bit more ""modern"" it was more fun to do the older version. Songs like I'm a Bad Bad man are taken out, making this less of a musical and more like a play. Ms. Peters I found also pulls off a big city girl a little better than a back woods girl. This is why Reba McEntire did Annie so well. Tom Wopat is truely wonderful, but I think he got cheated out of more songs that he could have handeled. I would have loved to hear his rendission of I'm a Bad, Bad, Man... But Alas we never will. If you're into modern things like the Lion King, I suggest this, but to good old fasion Music lovers like myself, I suggest the Ethal Merman or Betty Hutton Version."
4,Bernedette at her almost best.,"I had heard of Annie Get Your Gun, but never actually heard any music from it. What an introduction! Bernedette's voice as expected, is powerful and beautiful. What an accent though! She didn't need to sound as much of a hick as she does on the recording. Other than that, a great CD. Tom Wopat is excellently shows a side I didn't even know he had. Overall, well done and higly recommended."
5,"Bernadette, the crown jewel of Broadway!","I was fortunate to attend the musical, Sept 4th, 1999 on a recent trip to New York City ... Bernadette Peters shines in the role ... she brings a new updated Annie Oakley to the stage ... also worth mentioning is her excellent comedic timing ... her voice was right on, crisp and clear ... several times during the show you could hear a pin drop especially during her haunting rendition of Moonshine Lullaby ...Tom Wopat was a surprizing romantic lead for Bernadette's Annie and delivered an excellent performance as well but in my opinion Bernadette carries the show ... I would recommend anyone visiting NYC that they try and purchase tickets for this show ... and if not buy the CD ... and enjoy!"
5,Peters and Wopat SHINE like the stars they are...,"I saw this show in Ny a couple of weeks ago, it was fantastic. The music is awesome, and Peters is just...AWESOME!"
4,Let's go on with the show!,"A delightful CD with all the favourite songs. If you think that Ethel M is the ONLY Annie, you have a real treat in store here. Bernadette Peters gives the role her own spin with pathos, humour and lots of bawdy fun. Tom Wopat has a nice voice too, so on the CD he comes across as a suitable leading man. I was lucky enough to see this show in New York in July 00, and Tom seemed fat, flat and rather disinterested. (Perhaps he had a bad day!) The CD, though, is great - it cheers me up when I am down."
5,Peters at her finest,"I purchased this CD because our local high school is doing the show this fall and as the director of the pit band, I wanted a good resource to help with the rehearsals. The music, especially the voice of Bernadette Peters is so appealing, that it is the only CD that I am listening to at this time."
3,The show is Great-Disc Should be too,"Frankly, I havent heard this recording yet, but the re-vamped version of the Irving Berlin show is great and Bernadette Peters really shines. They didn't try to replace Ethel Merman or recreate her--the producers of this show essentially took the Berlin songs and wrote a whole new show for Peters. My only regret is that at the moment I have only the memory of Ms. Peters in her tight buckskin fringe!"
2,"Where it is Good it is Very Good, But...","I was hauling this CD off to trade it in. Listening to it in the car, I realized just couldn't part with it. My biggest complaint is that many of the new arrangements of the old Berlin/Bennett tunes are too ""eager to please."" Why? Invasive orchestrations. The Bad: a horrid Sinatra-style swing arrangement of ""Defenses Are Down."" (Berlin was NOT a swing composer, no matter when this show originally premiered.) The Bad: Bernadette Peters' 2 big ballands really drag. The Good: there's a lot, actually. All of the country tunes are spirited and charming. Peters has more fun with dipthongs than any singer ever. And, the bottom line is that the Annie and Frank relationship comes across in this recording. All in all, an historically important recording which reflects intelligently on Merman's legacy."
4,very fun,"i saw Annie get your Gun on broadway with Reba McEntire and it was the most wonderful thing i've ever seen.She has got a great voice and is a awesome actress. so I really wanted to get the cd to it. i was sad to see that they didn't have it with her, but i got this cd with Bernadette Peters instead. Bernadette Peters is really good and i highly recemand this cd, but if you want to see something really amazing go see the broadway show."
2,How sad that Miss Peters has been so miscast.,This recording is sadly not up to Annie Get Your Gun or Ms. Peters standards. They don't go together. The Ethel Merman recording is far superior.
3,Wish it were Ethel,"Bernadette Peters is great, but she is not Ethel. This revival has some interesting moments, but the Show Business number is reprised so much it become boring. Peters does her own interpretation of Annie, of course. But she doesn't have the big voice that made some of these songs work. Her Annie is too vulnerable. This is a 90's attempt to be relevant."
3,Assumes you have a huge plot of land,"Most of the projects in this book involve really big areas of ground. I returned the book because I was dissatisfied with this, but I think the Pizza Plant garden required a circle 18' diameter. That's about half our lawn! So, most of these projects were impractical for us, and I returned the book. I suppose that if you are a serious gardener with a lot of land you might like this book."
5,Great book for Gardening with Kids,"Again a great book for gardening with kids. For example a sunflower house, pizza garden, a garden of giants, and a water garden. The neat thing is that you spend time gardening with your children and the kids get to enjoy playing in what they have grown."
2,A Disappointing Ripley,"Although Highsmith stuck with her formula (two deaths per book involving Ripley), this book was disappointing and a bit boring. Somehow I think this book evolved out of Highsmith's curiosity concerning ""what if"" Ripley had a kid (what would his fathering instincts be like). It really doesn't work in this one and Ripley begins to look sappy rather than sinister in a passive way. Also, Frank seems way too precocious for a sixteen-year-old. Arguably the worst novel in the Ripliad."
4,only pretty good,"I just read all the ripley books, and this was my least favorite. It starts off good, but as soon as Frank is safe from the kidnappers the books meanders and takes a really long time before its (to me) chilling ending. I'm sad there are no more ripley books, but I think I may enjoy reading them all over again, even though they won't be as suspenseful. Maybe I'll like this one better the next time around. I also think the author didn't need to make Ripley so apologetic about his past deeds."
5,The Boy,"This book is definitely my favourite of the Ripley novels. Patricia Highsmith has an incredible ability to detail the touching relationship between Tom Ripley and Frank Pierson. Ripley remains a murderer who sees his dark deeds not as crimes but as necessary steps or precautions. His regret, for instance, when recalling his murder of another character in a previous book is cold-hearted and very funny: he remembers murdering the man by hitting him on the head with some wine. He then recalls that the wine was a good quality product, and he regrets having chosen that particular bottle to commit the deed.Oh how I love Tom Ripley novels!"
3,Death eagerly awaited.,"In the fourth Tom Ripley novel, we meet sixteen-year-old Frank Pierson, the younger son of a millionaire. The father, John Pierson, only recently died in what has yet to be decided as a suicide or an accident. Frank is intelligent, polite, and seeks out Ripley because he has a dirty secret to share. So why is he so headnumbingly dull?The novel is well written, to be sure, but so little happens really. Ripley is understanding and supportive - I didn't like this parental aspect of him much. Still, there is some relief. Ripley get into a dress, for one, and the last chapter was a chili pepper in a bland pot of gruel, and almost worth suffering Frank's immature and cowardly whining for the whole rest of the book."
2,"Fussy, sort of British","Don't read this unless you loved the rest of the series and can't stop. You just aren't going to convince me that Ripley could turn in the ransom money, or that his friends wouldn't keep it for themselves, or that his wife wasn't fed up with his nefarious doings and occasional sex drive, or that servants love their jobs the way Ripley's does, or that there was any reason for him to stay with the boy going to city after city, or that no one accused him of orchestrating the kidnapping. It was far fetched enough that the boy was anyone in the newspapers and it wasn't convincing that the boy would travel to Europe to meet Ripley. The city descriptions didn't float my boat either. Life gets more interesting when you are held accountable, which doesn't happen here. I agree with the reviewer who says these books are a waste of time. The movie is better, much better, and quicker."
5,Elizabeth Skips 6th Grade!,"Elizabeth is doing well in 6th grade,so the teachers decide to let her skip 6th grade and make her go to 7th grade,Good-bye Sixers Hello 7th and 8th Grade Gazette,which she will be writing for in The Unicorn Club series. Everyone is proud of her.Jessica is jealous of her.Jessica is getting Ds in school.Elizabeth hangs out with an older group of kids,and almost kisses Bruce Patman as a dare at a Party."
2,You are sleep on nothing.,"Agree with previouse reviewer. It is fluffy first, when I go to bed. But it will sink, then when I wake up at mid-night, I feel I am sleeping on the bed, not on the pillow. There is no support from the pillow, totally sinked."
3,You get what you pay for ...,"Well, they are a vast improvement over my old pillows. One was an almost flat down pillow, the other an over-inflated synthetic fill. The latter was unusable!These feather pillows are the right loft for me. However, you can feel the texture of the feathers (i.e. the shafts) and they are a little noisy at first. All things considered, you get what you pay for with these pillows. They beat synthetic fills any day, but can't touch a good down pillow. There you go."
4,Feather Fill Much Better Than Foam Rubber,These are good quality pillows at a fair price. They are so much better than other pillows that one might have to buy to achieve affordable pricing such as foam rubber fill and other non-feather fills.
2,A boring read,"I was not impressed with this story. Hannah and James didn't have one meaningful conversation on the 98 day trip on Windfire, much less any conversation. He wasn't even nice to her and all they did was bicker at each other. Then, I turn the page and he's 'deeply' in love with her! He doesn't even know her and he's begging her to marry him, running down a street shouting he loves her! And Hannah is determined to marry a man who deserted her, who she doesn't even love. She loves James too, even though she doesn't know him any better than he knows her. Sorry, but this book was a total disappointment to me. I had to force myself to finish it."
2,Magical musical-shame about the vocalists!!,"OK - Miss Saigon is probably my favourite musical of all time, but this recording really does not do it justice. If you want to experience the real magic of this show, you should purchase the ORIGINAL London Cast Recording which features the amazing vocal talents of Lea Salonga, as well as Jonathan Pryce and Peter Polycarpou. The only good vocalist on this recording is Ruthie Henshall. Joanna Ampil is also good, but no-one can sing the role of Kim like Lea can."
4,Really nice bookcase,"When put together, this bookcase is lovely. I put together two of them. That is where the one star off comes in. I knew that there was some assembly required and what is said is that it isn't all that hard is also correct. BUT, when it came to putting on the backboards on with something like 16-18 small screws, OUCH. If you get this bookcase be prepared with an electric screwdriver, or use small nails. I only had a handheld screwdriver and 2 of these bookcases to assemble and boy did I SUFFER for it the next day. Otherwise, I really like the bookcases, they are handsome, have shelves tall enough and deep enough to handle all the books I have to put in them, even the larger binders. I would recommend this bookcase... as long as you have an electronic screwdriver or very well developed arm muscles."
4,Nice selection of stencils,"The stencil patterns in this book are large and easy to trace onto your stencil - I have used them on walls, mirrors (with frosted paint) and on furniture to make my home look more Indian without having to spend a lot of money..."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I enjoyed the variety of ideas that this publication provides. But since it is stenciled art and not actual stencils, it is difficult to use. My plan is to scan the art, flip the black to white and the white to black to create my stencils. If you're not planning on doing something similar and having fun with an X-acto knife, I'd skip purchasing this book."
4,"""Open Channel D""","The men from U.N.C.L.E return in another classic video featuring episodes from the series when it was at the top of it's game. Basically THRUSH is making toys that kill and Solo has to put a stop to it... ""open channel D!"" I love that!"
1,Premier Pet Squeeze Meeze,I bought the dragon and the lady bug. My Aussie had them both in pieces in 10 min so if your dog likes to chew avoid these.The search for long lasting toy continues.
4,Not very durable,"This was a great toy, while it lasted. We played with it everyday for 2 weeks until the tail ripped off. I was playing tug-of-war with my puppy, so the tear is understandable, but we play tug-of-war with all his other toys and they are holding up. I think I can fix the dragon with some duct tape. Just know this isn't a great choice if your dog/puppy likes to play rough."
2,Lasted 10 minutes,"My dog chewed off the legs in less than 10 minutes. She was supervised, but she still managed to rip them off quickly. (She was probably about 8 months. Adult teeth. Puppy energy.)Despite that fact that she LOVED the way the legs straightened when she squeezed it, I will not buy another latex ""squeeze meeze"" from premier. It seems unsafe, and it certainly doesn't seem worth the money. I'm only giving it two stars because she did think it was cool."
2,Less than expected,I have bought this product many times and gotten the exact same item all the other times. These were much smaller than all of the ones previously purchased even though the same description was given as the others purchased. The price was the same as the best price I got the others for. I would not purchase through this vendor again.
1,No durability,"My puppy ripped the tongue and tail off of this toy within 30 minutes. And of course once there's a hole in it, it no longer squeaks. I'm not impressed with this toy at all."
1,I don't know why my pug won't touch this,"My pug loves little squeaky stuffed toys and I wanted to try something different with this cute dragon. I don't know if it's the texture of the rubber, that it's not stuffed, I don't know but he will not play with this toy. I'm sure other dogs will like it, but no for my lil pug. It's so cute too, the way the little tongue shoots out when you squeeze the toy, I'm bummed!"
4,crypticprincess,"I would have returned this item as it arrived with no 'squeeze action' but it was intended as a Christmas gift and I didn't have time. I had ordered 3 other squeeze toys that were also gifts and worked great, the dogs were thrilled. The dragon and elephant most definitley the cutest toys"
4,Dogs love it.,"My dogs were so excited with the octopus that they fought over it. If one had it, the other would follow them around until it was dropped and snatch it up. I bought another, but they both like it so much them try on keep both. It was only about a three week period when they started pulling off the tentacles, but the body is still hole and it does still squeak."
2,dragon toy,"This was a very cute toy..it lasted all of four days. My lil beagle beat the ever loving u know what out of it, and the tongue and tail were quickly cur-tailed!!"
2,cute but overpriced,"I should have read more about this toy before I bought it. The picture alone it looks plush and not rubber. My dog hates rubber toys he will catch them and immediately spit them out in disgust so for me it truly was not worth it. Still, four bucks on a rubber toy I still think that is a bit much. Especially how tiny it is."
3,Not good enough,"My German Shepherd puppies have fun playing with it, but in the first week tore the tongue and tail follows, also I imagined the dragon a very largest as it really is."
3,Fun toy that I only bring out for supervised play,"The description says that it will keep your dog entertained for hours on end...that isn't really a fitting description for this toy and I knew it the moment I pulled it out of the box. This is a very cute toy with a loud squeak and my dog's eyes light up when I bring it out and we have fun with it together for a few minutes. That is the key, this is a toy that I only use when I'm engaging play with her and right there with her. If I left her alone with this thing for even a minute, she'd have a hole in it so I don't leave her alone with it."
1,"Loved it, but wrecked within minutes, no durability!",This was a big hit but didn't even last 15 minutes. My dog chewed right threw it. Unfortunately wouldn't recommend unless your dog is not a chewer at all! It just doesn't have any durability.
2,Doh!!,Based on other reviews I thought this would be a good toy. Too bad for me my puppy chewed through the tail & tounge in less than an hour - so no squeking for him!!
2,Another Nu Energy,"Tony De Vit delivers another Nu Energy mix. It's catchy and easy to get into. However, the style is dated. Ther are much better choices out there."
5,Moving in blissful harmony!,"Gary Taylor is a romantic artist who creates beautiful music that will make your heart sing and your mind dance to the melodious rhythm.Follow along as Taylor takes you on a ""Love Dance"" filled with poetic words and passionate beats. This artist reverberates the mood in each tune. And, just in case you missed a beat, Taylor takes you back to a reprise of ""Love Dance"".NOTE: Wine and candlelight are not required because they are included in the music of this romantic masterpiece."
2,A dissapointing game,"I loved the movie Minority Report, and eagerly gobbled up the book as well. However, I expected more from a video game based on my #2 movie of the year, Your meager three weapons--A compressed air rifle, pellet shotgun, and spark machinegun--can only hold one clip, and the auto aim takes all the fun out of combat(not to mention the fact that you couldn't kill people). Unarmed combat isn't much better due to hypersensitive controls--it took me 8 tries to execute a combo in training. The foes are unimaginative and easy, and John Anderton looked nothing liked tom cruise. I ended up getting a little bit of fun out this game by turning on the FPSSTYLE and MRJUANEZ cheats, the beating it in about 10 hours. There are definitely better choices out there."
4,my first :),"this was my first ps2 game..so it will always be dear to my heart, finished it in 3 or 4 days(school days)... its a fun little beat em up and idk why people hate it....u can beat people up and throw them threw the window and the voice overs were so cheesy it was hilarious ""oh NO! IM FALLING!""i cracked up...fuuunny stuff...to me it is better than devil may cry...camera angels are better, beating up on the baddies is better..everything is better...i dont know why its hated"
3,nothing groundbreaking,Dont compare this to the movie! Just think of this as a fun action game and that is what it is. Nothing groundbreaking but fun for the most part. The N64 style graphics and sounds brings the ratings down. Could have been a bit deeper as well. I enjoyed it more then wolverines revenge though
3,Kinda Fun...,"I bought this game thinking that it would be spectacular. Boy was I wrong. While it has its fun moments, it is mostly monotonus and boring. The fighting system isn't bad, but the graphics are sub-par. The rest is just average. 3.5 Stars"
2,I was wrong.,"When I heard of Minority Report the game, I thought it would be a lot like the movie. I was wrong. In the game, cops, guards, and robots try to kill you. Not knock you out kill you. You kill atleast 3000 people. In the movie like 1 guy died. I was disapointed."
2,My 4 year old never cracked a smile,"I bought this for my 4 year old and he didn't laugh once. He thought the zebra riddle was cute but the concept of most of the riddles doesn't make sense to him. He is very intelligent, but the terminology to most of the riddles don't speak to young children. Such as ""Name two kinds of wood you would use if you made a statue of Clifford"" answer: ""Giant Redwood and Dogwood."" Or, ""What did Clifford do to get rid of dog pounds"" answer: ""He went on a diet."" If you get the riddle it's cute, but I found most of the riddles to be dissapointing. Most younger children don't get puns or riddles altogether. My son and I read it twice, but it will probably go on the book shelf never to be read again. He loves Clifford, but this one just didn't add up."
3,Not for beginners,"If you are just staring to read Japanese and can't read Kanji yet, then I do not recommend this version. It does not have furigana (hiragana above Kanji script) If you are looking for furignana Bible I recommend ""Bilingual Bible"" English and Japanese."
1,Unhappy with Pump-n-Seal 30 Day Guarantee,"I purchased the pump-n-seal from the Pioneering Concepts website, hoping to use it on both jars and plastic bags as advertised. The method for sealing plastic bags was ridiculous so I opted to return the product. It was never used and barely unpacked. After contacting the company about returning it, I was told my refund would be minus my original shipping plus an as yet undetermined handling fee and, in addition, the refund would be lowered because this is a food product that could not be resold as new. I was offered a rebate of $8 on my $42 purchase and told I could keep the product. Since there would be additional expenses to ship it back to get a refund of less than 1/2 what was paid, I opted to keep it. Hey - anybody want to buy a pump-n-seal cheap? Never used!"
4,Had the old version,"I found the old edition of this book in my flat when I lived close to Chichibu. I lived in Minano, which holds the last temple in the 34 temple pilgrimage.The book gave some good information but I felt not enough history about the different temples or the different sects that each temple follows. Never the less the book is very good and better than the cartoon map that you can find in town.Any book that can help you get off the beaten path in Japan is great."
3,Not his best work,"I like Loudon's later work a lot, so bought this best of. But this collection disappointed me. I listened a couple time but it did not grab me like the later work."
4,good gloves!,these gloves are very handy for my hubby if he is doing some laborous work or even when he works out(he uses them to lift weights) and they work great!
4,greatest hits of tayna tucker.,This cd has alot of her hits from the 80's and 90's like just another love for example. on a scale of 1-10 I would give it an 8.
3,A little too realistic for us...,"This is a very nice toy if you are looking for something seriously realistic! When I opened the box, I actually jumped - it looked like a real dog was in there. My husband and I both found it a bit jarring, and we packed it up and sent it back. The construction that makes it so lifelike also makes it a bit stiff. Couldn't really imagine our preschooler cuddling with this at night, which is what we were looking for. So, if you are looking for a truly lifelike stuffed cocker, this is for you. If you are looking for something that does NOT look like it came from the taxidermist, keep looking..."
5,Far exceded expectations!,"I grew up with a Cuddly Dudley stuffed animal and loved him. I saw this guy and although he was smaller than Cuddly, he reminded me of him very much. So on a whim I purchased him and am I ever glad that I did. This guy looks so real! Two of my children commented that they have been surprised by a ""dog"" being in the house. It took them a moment to realize that this was a stuffed animal! He is very soft and very close to life sized. Very well crafted, I am sure that I will have my new Cuddly for years to come!"
4,Butterscotch,Butterscotch traveled all the way to Texas and now lives with a real chocolate cocker spaniel. He carefully sniffed her and decided that she could stay. She guards the living room from a shelf below the TV. The real dog is not good with small children so they can hug Butterscotch when they visit.
5,Real honest hardbop groove,I think this CD is just great. If it would have been on Blue Note it would have been a true classic. The playing is fine with great arr and a playful touch to the music.The sound quality is very good too.Highly Recommended!
5,Excellent short story collection,"Alice Munro is the queen of the short story genre. I have read other collections of her stories, but this one is memorable. It is a worthy winner of the prestigious Giller prize. Her stories seem so straight forward and simple at first glance, but as you finish each story, you realize that there is a complexity there and it forces you to go back an rethink the story again. These stories are all very good, but my particular favourite was ""Trespass"". It almost took my breath away with it's hidden meanings and nuances. I usually do not read short stories, but I make an exception with Alice Munro. Hers are absolutely wonderful!"
2,Not for anyone wanting to actually read the story,"This book is essentially a poor photocopy of an incomplete previous publication of the Shackleton journals and report. There are multiple missing and illegible pages. Of mild historical interest only, not for anyone wishing to actually read the work."
3,OK in a pinch,"I am a teacher and I bought this for use with my refugees who speak Nepali. It is really short and kind of old so it doesn't have all the words they need. I think there are better dictionaries out there, but this one will do in a pinch."
2,Don't bother,"I debated about buying this book and I should have gone with my gut instinct. It was a waste of time. The only reason I finished the book was because I paid for it, otherwise, I would have shipped it off to the local Goodwill store. I didn't particularly like Rafe and Imogen in Kiss Me, Annabel and they were no better in their own story. If anything, I wish the book had centered more on the Gabriel/Gillian story - that was a more interesting/heartwarming storyline. Unless you find this at a used book store or at the library, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time and hard-earned cash on this one."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I will refrain from summerizing the plot, as many other reviewers have done a fine job.All I have to say is that I really, really wanted to like this book, and I was really looking forward to it, for I loved Imogen's and Rafe's interaction in Kiss Me, Annabel. The first half of this book was decent, and I enjoyed it; however, something happened in the second half. The characters seemed to lose their wit and edge. I found myself trying to stay awake and wondering if (and when) the story was going to be resolved.I don't know what happened, but this story just stopped drawing me in, and when I finished, I was disappointed, for I was expecting a much better story than the one I read.Having said all this, I have to admit that this book might have been better if I hadn't had such high expectations for it."
2,Not worth it,"I have read all of the Essex sisters novel and this is the only one I can truly say I disliked. While I always enjoy Rafe, Imogen always comes off as needy bordering on downright b*tchy! She spend too much of the story pitying herself, talking about herself and whining about how much she's suffered. I was hopeing that her story would be different, that she would be different. But the side story with Gabe and Gillian was well worth it."
5,midsummer nights dream revisited,"third installment of the Essex sisters, Imogen, who was widowed in the first book, has finally begun to come back to reality. She is still living with her 'guardian', Rafe, Duke of Holbrook, but is looking for a lover. When the Duke's illegitmate brother - now a respected professor - arrives, he seems perfect. The brother has a daughter by a brief liason and a strong sense of morality. He is haunted by his social status. The Duke is also haunted by both his brother's death and his own dependance on alcohol. When more guests arrive, the mix of personalities, responsibilities, and mis perceptions overflows and creates a touching stew that makes it possible for prejudices & ghosts to be overcome and love to prevail."
4,The Taming of the Duke,"Fab, like Eloisa James stories are, loved the hero and the heroine. Will read more in the future from this author. One thing though, she reveled to much of previous charactes history, that I felt no need to read those books, so if anyone is planing og buying, buy the lot and read in order."
1,Don't bother,I thought the characters were lest than memorable and the story line was just plain and boring. Haven't read a book this bad in over a year.
1,A hopeless muddle,"Shakespeare was a great writer of comedies as well as romances. Eloisa James is clearly neither in this tedious fumbling of errors. What worked in the 16th century clearly does not work in the early 19th, or us reading it in the 20th.A romance is one hero, and one heroine, falling in love. Not a whole group of characters we could not care less about all being jumbled together for the sake of trying to sell a 'series.'"
2,A Rose by ANY other name....,"may smell as sweet, but calling it a rose sure makes it easier to order at the florist. This usually dependable brand name author just loses it in this confusing story. The names of the characters--Imogene, Rafe, Lady Ancillary-something--make it very hard to follow who they are. Descriptions are few and then when one character is consistently described as ""fat"" or havinga belly, then--poof!--he loses that one identifying characteristic. There also seem to be a couple of charming love stories hidden in here but I needed a trail of breadcrumbs to find them. Far too much work to be any fun--pass!"
5,A superior product,"I bought 32 North Stabilicers a couple of years ago. Used a lot this past winter. Still in great shape, but I will need to replace a few of the cleats before long. A much better product than the yak-traks I had been using. The yak-traks wore out very quickly."
3,work well - hard to adjust,"These cleats work very well for walking on ice and packed snow. However, I found them difficult to adjust and fit. The toe straps don't work well with pointier (such as my running shoes) shoes and slide to one side unless really tight. The ankle straps have to be very tight, too. If the straps aren't tight enough or aligned properly, the sole is too loose, slaps a bit, or the shoe slides off - annoying when one is out and about. I prefer the Kahtoola MICROspikes for fit and ease of wear."
4,Winter walking safety,"This was purchased for the next winter season, so a practical evaluation is still pending. The product appears well built and easily slips on/off. Should cleat replacement screws be needed, you could purchase like screws at your local hardware store."
5,Great traction,"I bought these to help negotiate icy winter trails in local natural areas. They worked very well. In addition, I also use them for stream beds, which get quite slippery in summer due to algal growth. In both cases, I'm carrying photography equipment that just will not tolerate either a dunk or a drop. These strap on, not held on by strecthy rubber.Strongly recommended."
4,Work as advertised,I bought these because the campus I work at uses four wheelers to plow their sidewalks. Those four wheelers have plow blades a fixed height above the ground on them and so they turn any snow into an eighth inch thick ice sheet.I spend about a third of the day out on that slick surface and these work very well so far. The only problem with them is that the toe strap isn't adjustable. That inability to adjust the strap makes these unable to fit one pair of boots and makes the toe strap worthless on another. I'm slightly concerned that too much stress is being placed on the middle strap but it has held up well so far.EDIT: It turns out the toe strap is adjustable. The strap folds over on itself to make a loop and I never looked closely enough to see that there are actually two loops.
5,Awesome traction,This year we had a ton of freezing rain and my wife and I were struggling to get our winter walks in. A friend showed me his stabilicers so I ordered a pair for myself. Well within a week I ordered a second pair for my wife. I walk about 3.5 miles per day and have worn the stabilicers the entire time for the past 4-5 weeks. Do the math and I have close to 100 miles on these things. I orignally thought the traction studs would wear down quickly but nope still look almost new. At this rate I will easily have 200 miles on them before winter is over and I may need to replace some of the traction studs at the end of the season not all of them just the two in each heel and the three in the toe area.They are a bit heavy but that just adds to the workout and at my age of 63 I have come to enjoy the extra effort! Best of all they are: Made in the USA!!
5,Balsamic vinegar,"I have been using this brand, 3 leaf rating, for years. My whole family loves it. When you can get a good deal on shipping, stock up. Reduces beautifully for a sauce or dressing."
5,Wonderfully moving - classic,"My review may be a bit biased. I was fortunate enough to know Fr. Clifford and he gave me my first copy of this book. We met when I was studying in Taiwan, and Fr. Clifford was in-residence in one of the Jesuit houses in Taipei. He was a wonderful source of inspiration. This book only captures a small part of a great man. It is a moving story of strength in the face of adversity."
3,"Jets Volume Three, Fury Altitude and Attiude.","Jets Vol.3 ,Fury, Altitude & Attitude: Fly with America's best pilots in training and battle in recently de-classified footage featuring the F-16,F-22,AND F1178.60mins,dvd,east west entertainment.Purchased this dvd at a Dollar General, good footage,some good quality other scenes not too much."
3,Vintage,"I thought this book was great and helped me a great deal but, after reading other books like this it doesnt have the style and ideas that artists use today.The books ideas are rather boring and you will lose intrest if you don't like his ideas for characters. Though if you do finish this book as I have you will be amazed at how much this book helps your drawing ability. this book is for beginners and intermediate artists alike."
4,Religion without Polemics,"This book considers many themes in the Bible, looking at it from the point of view of someone who has converted to Islam. The book is free of polemics and seems to be written in a very serene and thoughtful spirit. It is respectful of the Bible, and all interpretations of it, but puts forward new ideas and readings."
1,View From the Floor,Not a fan - I was attracted to it simply because i was looking for new music and one song is sort of catchy but the rest of the album is sort of scattered all over the place with no real uniformness.
3,"Three and half stars, really.","Moves a little slow in the beginning, but turns out well. I really liked Tori and the story was good. It wasn't my favorite, but I did enjoy it, and would read another in the series."
1,Rotten to the Core,"How cute and homey can a cozy be before it sickens you? This one has all the elements -- the single, inquisitive female sleuth with obligatory cats, the small town with its deep, dark secrets, characters with names like Bathsheba Butterbaugh -- but the end result is an improbable story-line filled with improbable elements, all told in a writing style that sometimes borders on the insipid. Tori Miracle is making a return visit to Lickin Creek, PA. On her last visit a historic building was burned and someone was murdered, as Tori keeps reminding us. Surprise! This time the same things happen. But the doctor says that Percy Montrose died a natural death. That's not good enough for Tori. She's convinced he was poisoned. Why nobody thought to do an autopsy until much later in the book is never explained. There is an attempt at a twist at the end of the book, but it's so lame that any perceptive reader will have seen it coming well ahead of time."
4,Classic Tom and Jerry,"The Fast and the Furry is my son's favorite, probably has something to do with the cars. It's classic Tom and Jerry hijinks with neither of them able to talk. The plot is fairly simple: Tom and Jerry have leveled Tom's owner's house with their chasing and destruction, they see a chance on tv for the winner of a car race around the world to get a new house. Both want it so Tom and Jerry create their cars from a junk yard and off they go. All the characters in the movie are fun and silly - lots of visual gags.Blast off to Mars is not as good as The Fast and the Furry, but it's still a fun space adventure movie with silly characters and visual gags."
5,2 Good Movies,"My kids, 2 & 6, love Tom & Jerry. My wife & I enjoy the movies with them. Both movies are equally good. They have watched them several times already!"
4,Sparkling wit!,"Lochte pairs an unlikely duo of detectives -- a teenage girl and a middle-aged private eye. There is a fine mystery afoot, but half the fun comes from seeing the teenage girl through her own eyes (gifted sleuth, woman of the world) and through the eyes of her partner (she's an out-of-her-depth pest), meanwhile seeing the private eye through the same mismatched binoculars. It's a Rashomon thing. While the mystery pulled me in and eventually made me scared, the ongoing comedy of misperception made me grin and even laugh out loud."
1,"Some ""Armor""! The Hinge Is the Achilles Heel","I had two of these cases. On the first one, the cheap sheet-metal hinge broke after a couple of months, just from opening and closing the case in normal use. After some back-and-forth, the manufacturer finally agreed to honor the warranty and replace the case. After a few more months, the hinge on the second one bent as well, for no apparent reason. Now they refused to honor the warranty. Since they're located in Canada, there's not much I can do. Neither unit was abused in any way, and both totally failed to live up to the ""Armor"" name. And the warranty is a joke, since the manufacturer just claims that the defect is my fault."
2,The description of the book is not what it is.,"I have great difficulty seeing how this book is holistic or for adult readers. It consists mainly of readings that are less than 3 pages and avoids abstract ideas or inferential questions beyond the lowest level. As another reviewer said, it is good for developmental learners, perhaps.According to the manual, the essays included are mostly between 9th and 10th grade level, yet the description from the publisher implies that it is for more advanced readers. The book is skills oriented with more pages of isolated skill instruction than actual mature readings. The editorial review is misleading. To call this book holistic is simply inaccurate. Each reading has a few unimaginative comprehension questions and some vocabulary but that is by no means what ""holistic"" means. I used it once for a college level reading class and found it to be less challenging than some books used in developmental courses.Doesn't anyone know what ""holistic"" means?"
2,Marcasite AMETHYST Filigree Sterling Silver Earrings,"The actual earrings are much smaller, shinier, and cheaper than they appear in the online picture. I was disappointed and wished I had saved the money to put toward a higher quality product."
3,Semi-illiterate apologists of corporatism,"All these critics giving one-star mark to Singer's text, should be laugh at for their uninformed but obstinate attempt to explain something that lies beyond ther mental capacities. But maybe, there's still hope that they can comprehend the difference between 'state' capitalism and socialism, and economic foundation and structure of, so called - globalisation process, if they ...read basic material regarding all these notions they are fond of using, but totally incapable of understanding. It is shame that there are so many willing appologists that aren't even paid for their incompetent propaganda-type services of corporate interests..."
5,BLOODFIRE BURNS THE PAGES!,This is by far one of the overall best of the Deathlands saga storylines. My only complaint? The characterization needs building upon. The comeback of the Trader is hinted at...but never fully explained clearly.But insofar as awesome action/adventure reading - this one is top-of-the-line.
4,Truly Charming,"Charming has become perhaps a devalued word and is a little old-fashioned. So is this book, and the charm is in its period and its attitudes. It is eminently readable, straight-forward in its style and very interesting from a variety of viewpoints. Be assured it is not just for sailors. An account of a vacation cruise in a small 19th century cat-boat (a sailing craft with one tall mast set well forward) down from the author's home in Massachusetts along the coast down into Florida.Henry Plummer is a remarkably capable man and a fond father - who treats problems with wit and tempers the challenge of small-boat cruising with fine meals (recipes sometimes included!). Written originally solely for family and friends - painfully ""pricked-out"" in the old duplicating process and then published on the insistence of his readers - for us too to enjoy this charming story."
2,A little too much to take..........,"I have read all of Jenny Lykins and have liked them very much, but this one was just a little too much. She happens to go back in time to the same year her best friend went back in time to? By the time I reached 3/4 through the book, I more or less found myself thinking ""oh come on!"" and ended up skipping to the happily ever after ending. The book is now waiting in the bag to be taken to the book exchange. I considered this one a waste."
1,Post modern crap,"This book is unreadable. I managed to get through a quarter of it before I gave up. To say that Olsen's writing is confusing is an understatement, it is not even confusing in a good way, like house of leaves. Case and point an entire chapter that is an internet chat between two characters, but nowhere in that chapter does it indicate who is speaking which lines, just line after line of all caps text. While his descriptions are vivid they tend to get in the way of the story and do little the help further the plot. The entire first quarter of the book could be summed up easily in a handful of sentences. I get the sense he had a good idea for a story but its execution is terrible."
5,Awesome!,This copy was actually autographed by the author. I was pleasantly surprised. Great price and great condition. I am very happy with my purchase.
2,Somewhat informative but not accurate,"Groza writes some basic information but really does not go into the proper detail or accuracy about the problems so many families have experienced with romanian Adoptions. His book was somewhat off track when he went into his ""fantasy characters"" in one of his chapters instead of providing more hope and better treatment guidelines. he seems to focus on old issues as opposed to new medical and psychiatric information which would have made the book more helpful. It read like a ""basic guide' as opposed to something more scientific or helpful to the family in need of assistance."
2,Good ideas but a bit off track,"As a Romanian, I found many of Groza's statements to be inaccurate although he tries his best as an American-Romanian. He did not seem to really understand the evolution of the Romanian culture which led to the serious problem of children in institutions (you would have to live there to actually know as opposed to just visiting). I could not figure out the relevance of his last few chapters talking about characters in a mocking sense--it just did not fit in the book's main topics. Having seen many of the children who have been adopted out of Romanian institutions, I don't think Groza gave a full picture of the long term problems these children are facing as well as their families. There are certainly good outcomes, but it seems Groza missed the issue of how the children fair over time as he is not a doctor who treats patients--more of a researcher on sociological matters."
1,irresponsible,"This book falls short of what one would expect of an academician such as Victor Groza.It is poorly documented;it is inaccurate historically,and his chapter re: Charlotans is completely irresposible,unethical,rude, insensitive,and ridiculous.That chapter is filled with all kinds of innuendos-sexist,racist,etc.As a social worker he is clearly in violation of NASW ethics.His attempt at paradoy is pitiful.While he vaguely attempts to disguise internationally known experts in the field of adoption,he fails-everyone who knows who is who knows the individuals to whom he is referring.This book is of no value to anyone!"
1,Surprisingly Bad!,"Zac Titus is a good actor, but he's given little to work with here. The script is very superficial.What begins as a pretty shallow character study, about 80% throught become a fascist screed! Very surprisingly one dimensional: very pro-war (specifically the US war on Iraq), very pro-Bush, and very militarist.It has 2 asexual gay characters....but why? What is the point?In the end, it is no more than strange fascist propaganda."
1,Expensive and fuzzy...,"Working as a nuclear electronics engineer on neutron detector development, I thought this book might give me some hints on how to develop new electronics. However, it is just a rather random collection of old techniques, explained in a handwavy way. For $20,- this book would have been a good idea to buy, but the price is too high for what you get...typically CRC Press !"
2,Good Pictorial History.,This book contains many historical Black & White photos of the FW190 in service between 1939 and 1943. 90% of the book is dedicated to photos. Most of the information provided is written descriptions to support the photos.The best use of this book is for those in need of FW190 pictures to support a modeling paint scheme or other historical art requirements.
