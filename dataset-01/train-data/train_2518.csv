4,Works Okay In A Pinch,"Hey, for five bucks, what do you expect?But if I don't have time to whip out the VOM, or Multi-Tester, it will get me through what I need. I never mix well-spent batteries with new or partials. So to use this on partially (not dead) batteries has worked fine for me and gotten me through some quick swap-outs until I could throw fresh bats into the equipment.Worked for me for what it is!"
4,Swan Song,"Sawn Song is the wonderful story of an apocalyptic time, when the only hope for people lays on the shoulder's of a small girl named Swan. I have read The Stand and Swan Song is far better. The detail is richer but not overblown and the characters are more believeble. I would suggest this book to anyone."
5,BEST BOOK YOU'LL EVER READ!!,This book is one of the best books out there. It will stay with you the rest of your life! This book will take you on a whirlwind ride of what the world will be like after nuclear war. I've read the book 30 times and will probably read it 30 more times.
5,Magnificient story line.,Want to read a book that will keep you spellbound from beginning to end? This is it. I didn't read it in one setting like so many reviewers state about books they read but I enjoyed every page. A gripping story about the end of the world as we know it. A book everyone should read because it seems so real. All the characters are great. So believable for a work of fiction. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
3,Fell flat,"Was absolutely loving this till the nonsense began with the ""magic glass"". Those chapters flagged badly and I began to dread them. Thing is, the picture of nuclear holocaust was so perfectly painted, it was not necessary to dip into a bag of magic tricks to make the story tick over. Early on though I must give props to this author for his prose, character portrayal, backstory & choice of incident. Conclusion is that this is a first rate author who made poor narrative choices after coming out of the blocks very strongly.I will read more of his work."
3,I enjoyed the book.,"Being new to the post apocolyptic genre, I gave Swan Song a chance. It was recommended by a few people, so I downloaded the book. I do have to admit that I enjoyed the book. However, it was soooo long!I did care about the characters. The main characters were well developed and the story kept me hooked. But I found myself skimming pages to get to more action. Maybe that's just my ADD kicking in. But I would recommend this book while letting everyone know that it is very long."
5,The best horror novel ever written.,"I am not normally taken with hyperbole, but I knowwhen I've seen the best of something. Just like""Dead Alive"" is the best horror film ever made,""Swan Song"" is the best horror fiction. Themonstrous scope of this ambitious masterpieceis daunting, and the interactions between thecharacters and the terrifying environment whichsurrounds them never hits a sour note. Readthis book, then wait five years, and read itagain. www.dishstory.com"
4,A 4 1/2 STAR REVIEW,"This end-of-the-world saga is considered a great companion to the classic The Stand by Steve King, and with good reason. Like its big brother, SWAN SONG delivers a knockout punch via its multi-layered characters, plot and scares. McCammon strongly weaves a tale of friendship and forgiveness among the havoc of the apocalypse, and that despite its been-there-done-that theme. Indeed, the author easily manages to come out of the rip-off ruins with originality and grandeur. His pen is as effective as any atomic bomb. Sure, the ending tends to verge on the melodramatic, but can you really hold it against him when the ride to there is such a wild and stylish one? A must for any fan of the genre.-----Martin Boucher"
5,WOW! What a ride!,"I absolutely LOVED this book and hated to see it end. It started off a little slow, but really cranked up after the introduction of the many players in this apocalyptic fairy tale.A motley crew of WWIII survivors - a 7' pro-wrestler called Black Frankenstein, a NY baglady, a deranged Army colonel, a cruel teenage boy and a young girl who holds the key to life in her hands - all become players in an epic battle between good and evil.I won't pull any punches - the violence and cruelty is horrific and hard to stomache, but the hope and beauty that manage to peak through the clouds outshine the ugliness.Robert McCammon does an extraordinary job of character development considering he has an enormous cast of characters to work with. I will certainly read more of his books. I can only hope that they are half as good as this one!Now I think he needs to start work on a screenplay of Swan Song - Hollywood could sure use a movie or miniseries like this!"
4,Modern Day Literature - Dark Story about Survival,"What happens after a global nuclear war? The author does an exceptional job at creating a series of inter-related stories, that demonstrate the different mindsets of individuals as they are faced with surviving in radioactive waste and destroyed cities and landscapes.Swan Song is an excellent book - and recommend it highly to individuals for literature discussions and school assignments. I thought it was a horror story, but found it to be a modern tale of survival, compassion, greed, love and friendship. Written in the spirit of Frankenstein, where evil characters were not motivated by evil - but by the need to survive.I found it strange (in a good way), that one of the hero's in the book (Sister Creep), starts out in the book as a homeless ""bag lady""."
3,A little too long...,"This book was good, however, I found myself skipping whole paragraphs to get to the ""good stuff""---and the ""good stuff"" would be the last 100 or so pages. Slightly similar to The Stand--not as good."
2,Pofff,"At least the bad man in the Stand had a character and was somehow charismatic. Here you have glimpses about the villain; he is never dominant; where he comes where he goes, what he dos whom he serves never never never told; he suddenly becomes dominant party; besides if he has super-talents or not you are not sure; at one time he seems more human than me; weak and easily scared; at other time he suddenly plays God; the narrative is second-rate; while similes and metaphors are not grinding type they are somehow not sophisticated. Lacks King's broad vision of culture,social reflections and political starkness. But I must admit: It reads well and flows but at the end you stand up, leave the book and that's all folks"
2,Way overrated....,"...[This book] was entertaining to the extent that it gave me something to read on the train to work. I think the weakest point of the book, the one that actually ruined it for me, was this ""Evil Man"" that walked around killing people. Where did he come from? What did he want? If he is soooooooooo evil, then how can this girl affect him so strongly. And he always had eyes popping out of his skin, changing shape, it all just seemed so goofy! Since I'm ranting and raving here, this evil man is searching the country for this girl and the glass ring and he's riding a bicycle! Give me a break!And this ""Job's Mask""...what?!!?! When it cracks, it reveals your true inner self? Oh brother...."
2,You'd be better of with King's The Stand,"While Swan Song starts off well, it slowly grinds to a halt. The protagonist characters are fairly well developed but I found the main antagonist to be neither very scary nor very antagonistic. I know that there's better out there by this author but this isn't one of them."
3,"GREAT, but rips off THE STAND","Loved the epic sweep and end of the world hi-jinks, but was a bit annoyed by the blatant ... of THE STAND, by Stephen King. Most notably, having the devil named THE MAN OF MANY FACES, way too similar to King's THE MAN WITH NO FACE (one of the many monikers of the Walkin' Dude...) BUT, I did love the apocalyptic tone and it is really a page-turner."
5,McCammon's Best,"In my humble opinion, Swan Song is fellow Alabamian Robert McCammon's best work. Unfortunately I read this one first which made all of his others pale by comparison. If you like a good long yarn, ala Stephan King's The Stand, you'll love this one."
4,"good read, I just got bored with it.","It was a good read until I got bored from all the plot jumps. got about 400 pages in, might finish it later but for now it's on the book shelf."
3,Decent Story But Lacking In Drama,"The story is decent, if not particularly imaginative or new. It is enough to keep reading through the book, but there are few moments that contain page-turning drama or suspense. I know I have higher standards than most people in this genre, as I can really enjoyed King's best books along with Lovecraft and Barker. If you are the type of person who enjoys, say, Dean Koontz's writign, then you will probably really like this book."
3,"Good, not great","This is a good book. A fine depiction of nuclear annihilation. The characters are interesting and colorful. The problem for me is a personal one. I'm more of a realist and prefer to leave the supernatural aspects out of my post-apocalyptic novels. For that reason I enjoyed the first 300 pages of The Stand and then the book nose-dived for me. A similar thing occurs in this book though its not as pronounced. Overall, its not a bad story, just not great."
2,pretty average - starts well but quickly loses steam,"I did not really enjoy this novel. It seemed uninspired and none of the characters were very interesting.It started off okay but, to me, got progressively worse as the novel continued.The first few chapters where the characters were introduced and then those directly following where each character deals with the catastrophe and tries to survive were quickly paced and kept me turning pages.After that it is almost as if the author stopped trying and just slapped a middle and finish to the plot and called it good. Unfortunately, those last two parts are the majority of this novel.The science was also quite soft. You can't just crawl out of a hole 10 miles from ground zero a few days after touch down and only suffer slight nausea as a side effect... especially when you continue to drink the water from similarly affected areas throughout the rest of the novel."
3,Allow me to present the McCammon writing method,"It goes a little like this. First, find a great book like ""The Stand"", and copy it as much as you can. Second, come up a dangerous situation for your characters and then have them saved at the last second by dumb luck or a plucky little dog. Repeat this step untill book is done. So why does this book get three stars? Well ""The Stand"" was a five star book, so this had good source material."
5,epic adventure,This book is the best novel i personaly have ever read. The Imagination of Robert Mccammon is absolutely of the charts. From the first page to the last this epic adventure of the aftermath of nuclear devistation is mixed with the real and the supernatural. The characters are unforgettable. A must read.
5,Outstanding!,"This is an excellent book, one of the best I have ever read (and I've read a lot of good books). I just finished it two days ago and am still disappointed that it ended!Although not perfect in its depiction of a post-nuclear apocalyptic world (I'm a very critical reader), I have to say the major ""shortcoming"" of this book is that it is hard to put down! The action starts on the very first page and the pace never lets up until the very end; there is nothing irrelevant, slow or boring on these 950+ pages. This alone makes the book unique.Highly recommended!"
4,A Great Story,"I loved this book, it was the second book by McCammon I had read and it was better than the first (Wolf's Hour). If you liked The Stand you will like the similar Good Vs Evil theme in this one."
5,This Book is Awesome,"This book is in my top 5 favorites and one of the first I purchased for my Kindle. I also own a very old paperback version I will not part with. The story, the characters - everything is great. If you liked ""The Stand"" you will put it aside for this one."
5,An amazing read,"I got completely caught up in this book, and stayed up much later than I should have most nights to get further in it. You get completely sucked in to the gritty world and the characters' struggles. I could not put this book down. Anyone who loves post-apocalyptic books should definitely give this a read."
5,This is the best book that I have ever read.,"I loved this book. My mother told me that I should read it. Until I picked up Swan Song I had never been able to read a book from begining to end. They could not hold my interest. I never thought that I would read all like 1,000 pages of this book. But in 3 days I had it all read. I LOVED this book. I read it all and I wanted more. McCammon is the best. In my opinon not even King can hold a candle to him."
3,Entertaining Page Turner,"I wanted to give this book a 3 and a half star rating but there wasn't one. I would consider this book leaning a little more toward fantasy than horror. If I wanted to read a great piece of literature this wouldn't be the book. However, as a suspenseful sci-fi novel (which is what it is) well, it's really not too bad. It's an easy read that you can take on an airplane to quickly pass the time. Of course, there are many aspects of this novel that are outrageous and unbelievable, but that is what makes Swan Song a fun read."
3,"Not nearly as interesting as Steven King's ""Stand"".","Well, it's long. The characters are thin and the plot is fat. But, it's not a bad read if you want to shack up with an ""end of the civilized world"" ""people have turned into ruthless animals"" yarn. There are few surprises, lots of agony."
3,Deceptive but good for the genre,"I won't put any spoilers in here, so read on freely.If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic drama, this is a delightful book. The author has a knack for making you feel like you are ""in the story."" His writing style is pleasant and easy to get into.On that note, the blurb on the back of the book is somewhat deceptive, and at the end of the book I did start to wonder about why there weren't more tie ins between characters, but thats a personal viewpoint.This is a bit of a behemoth at over 900 pages, but the imagery is quite wonderful, and as long as you aren't a huge character critic, then its well worth the money."
3,worth the time,"A worthwhile read for sure,memorable also. Not in the top 5 books ive read or even the top ten but once you get past the the fall of the nukes its quite unputdownable. I certainly will read his novel ""boys Life"" at some point as it seems it's a much better read but very different of cause! Give Swan Song a go, it's worth the time."
5,One of the BEST books I have ever read!!!!!!,"Swan Song definitely ranks up there in my top three favorites, along with The Stand and Gone With the Wind! This is a wonderful book with lots of very interesting characters and a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. As with The Stand, you feel as if you know and care about these people. The first time I read this book, I could not (and did not!) put it down. I try to read it at least once or twice a year, because it's like going back to visit old friends. I would love it if this book would be released in hard cover, as I have already worn out two paperbacks"
2,Way over rated,"I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. It has a lame plot full of stupid people. Not one likable character in the book. Who is this evil mystery man and where did he come from. 1000 pages and no answer. Nothing in this book remotely believable. Why would anyone make wolf blood soup with intestines? Why not just eat the meat? Would gasoline be any good after 7 years. I think not. How can anything be planted in frozen ground or even grow in subfreezing temperatures? Where would you get coffee and cigars during a 7 year nuclear winter? How could you secure a town by digging motes in frozen ground and building walls made of logs in 4 days with no tools or heavy equipment? A total waste of paper and ink. A major ripoff of The Stand which was 1000% better."
3,Shallow Story,"""Swan Song"" is an OK read. I had higher hopes for it since it was an 800+ page book. I found the characters and story shallow. Everybody wants to compare it to ""The Stand"". The two books have similar plots (almost too similar), however ""Swan Song"" has poorly developed characters and completely misses the haunting atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world.""Swan Song"" isn't a bad read, it's entertaining and flows well enough. There's so much missing, it could have been a great novel with more characters and broader back story."
4,Everyone Deserves A Break Once in Awhile,"I've always been entertained by McCammon's books. That's all that I expect from them . Do not look for neatly-plotted, logically planned fiction from this author. This is escapist fiction at its least pretentious. Some people read true crime books, others read Lawyer novels and some of us are addicted to Daniel Steele or Belva Plain. McCammon is my dirty little secret. I just like him and think he is more entertaining than John Saul or V.C. Andrews, but not in the same league with Straub or King. If you require a breather from ""serious"" literature, you might want to give this author a try."
4,Wear your wrist guards !,"OK, this is a 1.6 pound book in trade paperback. Wear your wrist guards!Seriously, this is a rather good book. Especially if you like post apocalyptic speculative fiction. Several people have compared this book to _The_Stand_ and it is quite similar. However, it is a little more black and white than _The_Stand_ is. The characters and story are both very rich and the book is quite the page turner. But, I did not like what the author did with some of the characters (I refuse to believe that someone could decide to totally destroy the planet)."
5,Great storywriter,"My first by McCammon and I am impressed. For such a big book, I was kept interested the whole way. He didn't tend to ramble on when describing things. Just a great story. I will read more by him."
1,terrible!,"I bought this just today for my iPad, and within what would be 70 hardcopy pages I had to abandon this muck in disgust.So far the story is much too much like King's The Stand. Perhaps it differentiates as the story evolves, but it's so badly written and the characters so vapid and one-dimensional that I have no desire to continue.Perhaps it just required better editing; some artful curettage of the countless descriptions of characters' eye color, pointless and multiple descriptions of how the subway tunnel was illuminated by blue lights, and contradictory descriptions of the Colonel as both a fat slob and a ""discipline and control"" disciple may have helped.Am I being picky? Maybe. I do expect published works to be well written and imaginative, go figure.Read The Stand. Same story, infinitely better in terms of plot, character development, and style."
2,"If you've read The Stand, you've already read this book...","This isn't a bad book, but it's almost exactly the same as The Stand, by Stephen King, only not nearly as good, in my opinion. I was really disappointed by the fact that it was basically the exact same story not told quite as well."
2,"Good start, then, zzzzzzzzzz","Got excited to read this book after seeing some reviews posted here. Read through the 1st 100 pages and thought it was ""OK"", then it just started to get boooooring. I've read The Stand: much better writing, much more interesting, not much point in reading it again."
1,A different opinion,"This book is obviously a favorite with lots of people. Be warned, however -- if you didn't like The Stand, you probably won't care much for Swan Song. I am one of those people who disliked The Stand intensely, feeling it was an endless mass of mindless and writhing drivel so far below King's capability as to be unworthy of print, much less reading. Ditto for Swan Song as a McCammon product. This is the only book among hundreds I have purchased in five years, including most McCammon, that I simply stopped reading and tossed out after ~100 pages. Your reaction to the very first chapter is probably a good test. If this asinine portrayal of the inception of a (now rather outdated) WW3 doesn't irritate you, maybe you'll be able to stomach the rest of this cliche-ridden pseudo-religious stupidity. I couldn't. It's been a pleasure to get this off my chest, and at the rate people are posting bouquets for this book, it will disappear from the reviews pretty soon... ;-)"
5,The Stand fans...you'll love this one!,"For those of you who loved Stephen King's The Stand, this book rivals it. The characters are true to life and you will not put it down! Following the people in this inspiring book, you will come face to face with evil and see goodness prevail. It is truly beautiful and horrendous at the same time. Feel the pain and joy, despair and hope from a destroyed earth due to the final button being pushed by the powers that be and watch the comeback from humans who do not give up. Truly remarkable!"
4,fun time with the end of the world,"being a reader who loves apocalyptic writting this is one horror novel that needs to be in your library. I guess King's ""The Stand"" ruined me when I was a teenager so now I am always on the look out for great end of the world time stories - this would be one of them. While it would be great if McCammon could update it a bit - since this was written with the cold war ragging the books beginnings has Russia and US nuking each other so it can be a bit of a stretch given the current world politics, etc. But once you make the jump into the story McCammon nails the characters (good and evil), the story moves quickly (even for a large book), and you get an ending that is satisfying (not common for an end of the world novel). Check out this and the Eclipse series from Shirley- Well worth a read."
5,Fantastic story!,"I liked this book because the story, which is based on a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear holocaust, was extremely detailed and full of characters that I either loved or hated. The author created a story woven from many different story lines that came together to a magical ending. This book made me cry and laugh. A thoroughly enjoyable read."
4,Absorbing read,The characters in this novel are engaging and memorable--I read the book in less than 4 days! Too bad I have to work for a living....
4,Enjoyable read if you can suspend disbelief,"I enjoyed this book, but I still like Stephen King's The Stand better. The main reason is that the characters in Swan Song did not have enough depth. They were either ""good"" or ""bad."" I would have liked to see some of Swan's bad traits and some of Alvin's good traits, for example. Very few people, if any, are either purely good or purely evil in real life, and I felt that this is where Swan Song lacked credibility. Sometimes I actually felt like cheering for the bad guys because Swan was just too sugary sweet. Other than that, it was a decent book, worth reading."
4,Not sure why people love it quite as much as they do,"The book is okay. More than okay. Almost great, in fact, but there are so many things that don't make sense. Little things, you know? Like: years after the bombs go off people will say, ""Do you want some coffee?"" Huh? Where did you get that? So many little things like this makes the book fall a little flat - but it's almost super-amazing if you have your kid gloves on..."
3,Entertaining rip off of The Stand,"McCammon has always been a Stephen King wannabe, and this is his most blatant steal. It's the plot of THE STAND exactly. He did not even change the first letter of the villian's name! Here it's ""Friend"" instead of ""Flagg."" Still, McCammon is a good writer, and if you can overlook the plagiarism, this is an entertaining book."
3,No Billboard Chart-topper,"Like all of McCammon's books and stories, once this one gets rolling, it's difficult to put down. He has a way with words and descriptions that flows smoothly and swiftly and compellingly so that even his thickest novels are easy to tear through and enjoy. Swan Song is not one of his better works, however, standing above his not quite satisfying Stinger, yet quite a ways below his fantastic The Wolf's Hour. There are some technical aspects which don't quite mesh and the sudden, startling leap ahead in time seven years, and the whole thing is rather predictable in many ways, yet McCammon just has that knack for grabbing a reader's attention and holding on tight until the very end. I found Swan Song enjoyable enough, though perhaps it could have matured a little further in the author's mind before he released it. Worth a read. A decent time killer. Thought provoking."
2,"Too much fantasy, not enough sci-fi","I love post-apocalyptic sci-fi, stories about what would happen if everything broke down and none of life's securities we're so used to were there any more. I don't care so much for fantasy, miracles, magic mirrors, rings and crowns, ridiculously evil and annoyingly good characters. Swan Song is full of the latter and I guess that's why this book simply didn't do much for me.That being said it's still a pretty easy and captivating read and I do have to say that I wanted to know what would happen next until almost the end. So if you don't mind the girl with the golden curls and crowned with a magic glass circle defeating the evil shape shifter with the scarlet eye after going through a 1000 pages of hardship then you'll probably love this book like so many others..."
4,"A little long and tedious at times, but still 4 stars.","As the one line summary above says, the book can be a little long and tedious at points, but still an overall 4 star read.I must admit that the desire for the story to end really started to hit me at about the last 300 pages. So at this point I started to skim the last part of the book. Fortunatily by this point all of the major plot points where well in place so by skimming the last 300 pages I was able to conclude the book and still get satisfaction out of the reading experience."
4,Like the stand but better,"I bought an audio book version of this and started listening, my first impression was that it was a bit dated, then I started to notice similarities to King's The Stand, at that point I almost gave up. But, I'm glad I didn't. King can't write and this man can. In the end, I really liked this book."
4,"Friend told me about this book, thought I would try it.","It was the first time I read Robert McCammon work, it was fairly well written, I found his writing to be a little detailed for my taste, repeated things too ofter, the story was interesting and kept me turning the pages. I liked it o.k. just a bit too far out for my taste."
5,Awesome Book,"Love this book and have my original paperback, but while I am watching for the Kindle price to drop a little I will just have to get my scruffy paperback back out and read it!!"
5,MacGammon's Best,"I have read many of Robert McCammon's books. Unfortunately, I read this one first which made the others pale by comparison. If you enjoyed Stephan King's ""The Stand"" I am sure you will love ""Swan Song."""
5,One of THE most intoxicating books of all times!,"Swan Song is now, and forever will be one of my favorite and most loved books. It touches the heart and stimulates the brain. The realisticness portrayed by McCammon is unreal! It really makes you think about what would really happen if you were in those same people's situation. If you like realistic books that touches the head and heart, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,good enough to read 3 times,"I first read this book in the summer of 1992 and have read it about 3 times since then. This book had more action than some of the parties I throw, and believe me I throw some great parties. Since then,I have read every McCammon book written and will read every book he writes....YOU'LL LAUGH, YOU'LL CRY, THIS BOOK WILL BECOME PART OF YOU!!!!!!"
5,It's difficult to like a book more than I like this one,"I put off reading this book for years simply because I was afraid it was going to be a poor man's version of The Stand. I was dead wrong. McCammon didn't rely on any of King's elements. While one could draw a parallel between the two books, each is unique. I LOVED the characters in Swan Song. I thought McCammon gave particular attention to character development early on and I enjoyed the Job's Mask aspect. The description of the world after that fateful day in July is dreary and downright depressing but the strength of the characters and their persaverence gave me plenty of reason to keep reading. Granted this book will take you down some very dark roads but it's neccessary to fully grasp the desolation and despair in this new world.Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy if you enjoy apocolypse novels. I could argue Swang Song ranks above all others in this category.Characters: 5/5Plot: 5/5Scare Factor: 3.5/5Intensity: 4.5/5"
4,Swan Song - Robert R. McCammon,"Swan Song will be in the top 5 list of most fans of post-apocalyptic fiction. Many reviews are comparing it to ""The Stand"". I have read both books and other than the fact that they both have a good vs. evil and ""end of the world"" theme they are nothing alike. I would agree that most people who have enjoyed one book will enjoy the other. The book description has been covered well elsewhere so I won't repeat it here, I'll just say this book draws you in quickly and kept me up late many nights as I just couldn't bear to not know what happened next. You feel compassion for the ""good"" characters and real disgust and anger at the ""bad"". This is one of those rare books that I'm certain I will reread in the future."
1,Cheat the Readers,"Paperback from Amazon: $12.24. Kindle from Amazon: $13.99. Both prices ludicrous for a 25 year old book, but to pay more for a digital edition than for a bound copy is the epitamy of greed.No printing costs, no transportation costs, no warehousing costs, no refunds for unsold copied should add up to substantial savings for the publisher who won't pass those savings on to readers.I do buy books from the kindle store. I have about 20 right now, and I am willing to pay fair prices. The price on this one just cheats the readers."
1,"You're right, it's ABSOLUTELY NOT ""The Stand""","I have never been able to pick up a Robert R. McCammon book and finish it, with the notable exception of ""Blue World"". Not only could I not finish this one, I had to WADE through the part I did read... and it was like wading through cold molasses. I couldn't put ""The Stand"" down. If you want to read some Mccammon, stick with his short stories. If you want a post-apocolyptic thriller, stick with ""The Stand""... and then move on to the REST of Stephen King's Dark Tower saga... you'll find many more treasures than in this load of tripe."
1,Swan Song Kindle: TOO EXPENSIVE!,"This book has been written ...when? 25 something years ago? And you are asking more than a paperback copy?! Even more than some new copies for Kindle! No way! I will just skip from reading this book. The Publisher is a bit greedy here! Should only cost under $5! If not on the free listing! Geez! Sorry I will read another exciting choice and pass this one up! I can buy two or three exciting books for that. I may find it at the Library or an old used book store for a quarter to read later. Again...Sorry, NO WAY!"
1,Waste,"This book is trite, contrived in the extreme and disrespecful. I won't go on for 900+ pages. I paid about $8.00 to get it to my home. That was at least $7.50 more than it was worth as firestarter."
5,Story of hope in humanity's darkest hour,"From a surprisingly believeable description of what could touch off World War III, to Swan's ultimate rebirth and defeat of evil, this book had me right where it wanted me from the first page. McCammon weaves a wonderfully satisfying tale of horror and suspense, good vs. evil, darkness vs the light at the end of the tunnel. After the nuclear exchange of WWIII, three bands of survivors emerge to claim what is left of Earth. One is bent on destruction, another to protect the future and the third to find the answers to her many questions. Their story spans seven years. Years of cold, hunger, death and man's inhumanity to man. McCammon's ending to the story will bring a lump to your throat. I highly recommend Swan Song."
5,Great bok,"Swan Soong is one of the best books I have ever read. At first, I thought I would never finish it because it was so long, but after the first few chapters, I had a hard time putting it down. It has a great plot and wonderful characters. Anyone who can read should check this one out!"
3,Good but depressing,This is a well written but incredibly dark and depressing story. I almost stopped reading it half way through because it was so bleak.
4,Thoroughly good read,"I am sure this could be made into a good movie......I thought it fairly rattled along and although the characters were all larger than life and although it was all very unlikely it was a good old fashioned adventure with a good feeling to it. Good versus Evil. My only criticism is that the time frame when it was all happening was a bit quick...but hey its fiction, and it was a good read."
5,Probably the best I have read,"I first read this book about 10 years ago. I just finished reading it for the third time. I have never read any other book more than once. It was the first book I read by McCammon and enjoy most of his novels.I am currently hooked on the Mathew Corbett series, but still return to Swan Song. It is very simply the best book I have ever read. McCammon's characters are always incredibly full and infinitely well developed. You feel like you are reading about someone you know, not just a character in a book. This story really comes down to a story of hope when there should be no hope. Courage when there should be no courage. An incredibly satisfying and ultimately uplifting tale."
5,McCammon's Magnum Opus,"McCammon has a body of classic horror fiction works. This one most people compare to Stephen King's ""The Stand."" They are similar in two respects: 1) They're both very big books; 2) They both are about the end of the world, or what happens after a major cataclysm changes the world as we know it.Personally, I couldn't stand ""The Stand."" But McCammon's book is a page-turner. Despite the various plot threads and the complexity at which he weaves them together, I found it nearly impossible to stop reading. The main characters are all compelling and emotionally involving; the pace is cinematically scripted (a lot of action, suspense and movement); growing climactic tension keeps building making you want to see how it ends.This was the fastest 1000 page read I've ever had, and really was quite a ride. If you're new to reading McCammon's work, or have found his earlier novels exciting, you MUST read this book!"
5,shadow warrior review,This was a great follow up and clarified so many things regarding the individuals. I enjoyed the continued development of the characters as well.
2,Does not work for my scalp,"Yes, this shampoo leaves my hair moisturized. I can feel the difference. But no, my scalp is just as dry as always after wash."
1,Horrible job by Amazon packaging this item,"As several reviews have already stated, Amazon tapes the flip top, but does not secure the crew cap. Mine was loose upon arrival.Also, this shampoo looks very thin, almost as if it was watered down. I've used American Crew shampoo for many years, and never have I seen it thin like water. It's as if it was cut by 50%"
1,Disappointed - Pay Attention to Other Negative Reviews,I wish I placed more emphasis on a fairly high number of recent negative reviews before buying this product.I have been using American Crew Shampoo bought in local stores for several years and really like it. It is very thick and leaves my hair quite manageable.This has a slightly different name than the stuff in the local store and is not the same product. It is very thin and quite often I get a big handful of the stuff if I am not paying attention. No better than the $5 a bottle stuff in the local grocery store.
3,"shampoo good, smell bad","I read the reviews for this shampoo before buying, and thought it sounded pretty good, but I think it's just average. I would have given it 4 stars if it didn't smell so bad."
3,Very over-rated,"I understand this is a great brand, with a great line up of pom, paste, you name it.Probably also the reason for the very ratings, but you really shouldnt be influencedby brand name when judging a productAnd in that regard, I can confidently say that this shampoo is very mediocre. I didntfeel my hair was much different after washing (twice). I have normal slightly curly hairIve been using this for a month now, and I really can't tell much difference in my hairI received much better results using pantene's pro-v (my last shampoo)Overall, stick with their pomade, but choose something else for shampoo"
2,Too Watery,"Very rarely I buy a product with high rating and find it to be way less than mediocre!This Shampoo is so watery that it seems as if they took a 15oz bottle of normal shampoo and added 15 oz of water to thin it out!As a person who has owned Crew before, I was ready to return it to Amazon as it almost looked like fraud but kept it and used it because I hate to go through shipping over $18 product but rest assured I will not buy another one.Density of this shampoo is like water... Product smell is good to me, performance is OK but you need to use more due to it being so thin..."
4,I like American Crew,"The shampoo works great as an everyday shampoo. Without this shampoo, my hair is rather dry and brittle without the shampoo."
5,great smell!,"I love this stuff! I had been using Pantene w conditioner and it was leaving my scalp a bit dry. I wanted to try something different so I gave this a try after reading many of the positive reviews. I love the smell of this, it's not overpowering, just enough very pleasant smell. My scalp is no longer dry but perhaps that's due to the companion conditioner that I also use now."
3,curious to try,"I read in the reviews that this product was amazing, so I was curious to try it. It worked okay, with little scent."
4,Great but perfumy,"The shampoo is great, it leave my hair nice, clean and not too dry, but perfume sensitive buyers be aware that this shampoo contains a strong men-style perfume.Other than that, it's a great product."
1,Does not work,Does not work any better then any other product that doesn't work.Can't understand why somebody can't make a shampoo that actually does give moisture to dry hair..
5,Great value for the money,I started using this shampoo after it went on sale locally but just finding it in a store at a decent price is tough to do. This is a great value and I think that it works great and is one of the better shampoos that I have used. I don't feel like it damages my hair and but does clean everything off of my hair.
5,"The best, period.","I love this shampoo, along with its cousin conditioner! By far, the best product that I've used. It is absolutely salon quality. However, my favorite part is the price! You pay about this much retail for a bottle a third of the size. 33.8 ounces is more shampoo than you think. A fantastic value for a great product!"
2,Not very good,Does not lather or clean well.Low quality shampoo.Should be labeled Women's shampoo.Not sure why it rates well.Much better choices out there.
5,Girls go crazy with the smell of this shampoo,"If there is anything that initiates my memory of going to the barbershop back home it's this shampoo. The smell of it is remarkable. It's manly and the shampoo leaves my hair softer then before. And I have very dry hair, the kind that pokes your hand when you move your hand back against the grain. I am not saying that I am a cosmetologist or an expert in the field of shampoos, but from personal experience, it works great for me and my type of hair. I always recommend this to my friends and girls always complement the way this shampoo leaves my hair smelling."
4,good bad and smugly,"Great product ,great price. Each bottle( I bought a 2 pack) packed separately. One was spilled and needed to be returned.My postmaster refused to take the leaking box back. I phoned the Amazon people with my story and they simply replaced the second bottle with no questions asked. Thanks Amazon!"
1,be aware of this counterfeit product,The color of the shampoo liquid is noticeable diff from the authentic product and definitely I barely smell the aroma of this counterfeit shampoo.
4,Nice shampoo at a price I can justify,"I'm not too choosy about my shampoo. But after years of using Herbal Essences I decided I should probably wash my hair with something that did not smell like a feminine hygiene product. On the other hand I did not want to go the other direction and purchase a Tag or Axe-like shampoo that would leave me smelling like the 19 year-old undergrads that I teach.I looked at a few designer shampoos, but to be frank, I'm not going to spend thirty dollars on shampoo. Not on a TA's wages, at least. I found this shampoo recommended in a men's style magazine and I'm pleased with it. I paid ten dollars which seems fair. It leaves my hair feeling clean and has a pleasant, masculine (though not overpowering) scent. If the price has not raised significantly I recommend this product."
4,Nine Tales of Outsiders,"Dan Clowes is a wonderful artist and storyteller. He's work is also very melancholy, and this collection is no exception. As long as you come into these stories knowing they are melancholy, it's very enjoyable.The characters featured in these stories have a wide range: from a traveling caricature artist to a young hipster girl living off of inheritance money. One of my favorites is about a fourteen year-old tick-or-treating for the last time, and all the different, bizarre, houses he goes to.More then one story leaves you wondering if the character telling it is crazy. I like this use of an unreliable storyteller. It leaves you with something to talk about."
3,Nabokov?,"Is that what the editorial reviewer said? Nabokov? Don't get me wrong, I like ""Eightball"" comics but let's not go overboard here. And this collection of short strips is nowhere near as good as ""David Boring"" or ""Ghost World"" (or Nabokov)."
5,Better than the original,I bought this as a replacement for a broken strap. It seems to be better quality than the one that came with my Casio. It fit perfectly.
4,Not bad!,"I needed a replacement for my casio watch and this was the closest I could find. Had to trim the area that houses the connector pins, but that was no problem. It seems a bit thin so I'm very careful with my watch now. Not too bad of a band for the price."
2,didn't fit,"i would have given this item 5 stars if it didn't lie to me. the product is actually pretty good, but , as opposed to what it claims (that it fits any casio watch), it does NOT fit my casio watch."
2,"The good thing is, it fits.","This strap fit well on my watch and wrist and generally looks the part, but it has failed to live up to the most modest of expectations beyond that. While I like the look of the watch band, the small loop that retains the tail end of the strap broke the first day I started wearing it, rendering the whole thing practically useless. I honestly wouldn't be too concerned by this malfunction except for the fact that it's tough to find replacement loops for less than the cost of a whole new strap.I suppose the moral of the story is that you get what you pay for."
2,Casio strap,"Not a very nice strap, flimsy and not as sturdy as the original. It works but no where nic as the original, also thought it was over priced"
1,chloe,the quality of the sound recording was the worst I have ever heard. I have other CD's of the same person and the difference is staggering.
4,CHLOE,"This is a beautiful assortment of Irish and celtic songs, that I enjoy listening to while taking a bubble bath. It is soothing and relaxing and Chloe's voice is like that of an angel singing. I would recommend this to anyone that is fond of this type of music. I would purchase more music from this very talented artist and if you want something to relax by, this may be a good selection for you. She can also be seen singing with other celtic women, on your local fine PBS station."
3,WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME,"I HAVE THIS CD, THIS BAND WAS REALLY DIFFERENTIT WAS WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME..I THINK THEY BROKE UPWHAT HAPPENED TO THEM? IT BLENDED ALOT OF STYLES, METAL TOALTERNATIVE, I WONDER WHERE THEY ENDED UP, DID THEY EVER TOUR?I THINK THAT STUPID METAL LABEL NEVER SUPPORTED THEM AT ALLGOES TO SHOW WHAT A POOR LABEL THEY WERE! PICK THIS UP IF YOU WANT SOME ORIGINAL HEAVY ALTERNATIVE MUSIC. THIS GROUP WAS JUST TOO ORIGINAL FOR ANYONE TO APPRECIATE. SOUNDS LIKE A MIX OFTHRASH, GRUNGE, METAL AND FUNK"
1,Not Compatible with The Singing Machine,"From the descriptions, I thought the songs were from the original artists. They are NOT. Furthermore, the thing won't play on the SInging Machine. I don't know if the fault is with the Singing Machine or with the CDs. but I am returning the CDs!!"
3,Missing The 70's Disk,It was missing one of the disks....the 70's one...other than that it was okay. It would have been 5 stars if it had all the disks.
2,Not enough recipes in book,As a person who LOVES indian food but cannot make it...The recipes were too hard for someone who is used to cooking American food. There are too many ingrediants and too complicated. The glossy photos were great but there are too many photos and has too much emphasis on the photos and not enough easy recipes in the book.
2,"food OK, recipes aren't as fast as you'd think","I found these recipes disappointing. The flavors are OK, but generally the texture is mediocre (could be me, although I don't have issues with cooking non-Indian food), and the recipes take much longer than the promised 30-45 minutes. Pay attention to recipe sizes too--these make LOTS of food, so you may want to halve the recipes on your first attempt so you don't wind up with an overflowing pan of meat that you're not crazy over."
4,Hot stuff,"Most of the recipes are very high in ""heat"" factor, so beware of your guests' ability to handle the heat before serving up at a dinner party. Recipes are intended to take 30 minutes or less to prepare, which is a plus for a busy person. I have not tried many of them yet, but the book is very well put together."
4,One of the best cook books available,"I must say that this book is one of the best cook books available. Like the title says, it is quick and easy. I think I have made almost every recipe in the book and none of them take more than an hour, which if you have ever made Indian food before is a very short time.One piece of advice , get yourself a quality pressure cooker , any Indian store will have it. The other thing is that you will need Garam Masala, and although the book explains it, just pick a pack up at the Indian store while you are there. All other ingredients are available at any super Walmart.PS. Proportions matter!! so don't guess."
4,"Qick delivery, great condition....but","The item arrived far earlier than I expected based on the quoted delivery. The book appeared to be in great condition, near brand new. However, I have noticed, with just a little use, that the binding is starting to break at the locations of some of my favorite recipes."
3,Indian Recipes can be very rewarding,"Indian recipes are mouth wateringly delicious not just because of the mix of spices, flavors, aromas, varied texture of foods (vegetables, meat, grains, etc.) but also for the stunning food arrangement.I think its important to be upfront about food presentation since 1st time users/cooks may not be able to achieve the picture perfect results displayed in the cook book which could lead to some disappointment especially since significant stakeholders and others may choose to judge the outcome based on the picture in the book.Indian recipes have never been this much fun especially since they've entered the mainstream cuisine and are one of the more popular cuisines worldwide! The trend has been recognized by Lufthansa who have used this insight in creating a promotion where people can upload their favorite Indian recipes to win cool prizes including a grand prize (round trip to India). Promo info is available here [...]."
5,Easy Indian Cookbook,I had never cooked Indian food before. This book made it easy. Many of the items have to be purchased in a specialty grocery store but since we have an Asian market a couple blocks away that was easy to do.
5,This book is the best!,"I got this book in a bargain bin at a bookstore a few years ago: What a find! Madhur Jaffery has pretty much catered the majority of my dinner parties since then. Lamb vindaloo, Chicken Korma, mushroom curries! So Delicious! Her simplistic technique and strong voice make the recipes easy to follow and hard to resist! The best part is, her ingredients can be found at any small town grocery store. You can't go wrong with this one. I'm ordering a few copies for Christmas presents right now and my mouth is watering thinking about that vindaloo!"
4,Great cookbook,"I agree that once you stock up on the spices, it is easy to prepare these great-tasting recipes.One question: When she referes to ""chicken pieces"", would this be boneless, skinless?"
4,Indian delight.,"Great recipes. I would have to read more about curries!!If you love indian food, get it!!! And you would love the pictures!!! MMMMMM delicious!!!"
2,Disappointing - Look elsewhere for authentic Indian flavors,"I got this book hoping to reproduce the wonderful dishes found in Indian restaurants. After several disappointing results I loaned the book to an Indian friend. While she was excited at first, after a weekend review, she indicated that the recipes were not very authentic and not very good either.Another problem, in my opinion, is there are just too many non-vegetarian dishes. While I am not a vegetarian, I don't care much for the Indian approach to cooking meats. This book only has one small chapter to cover both legumes and vegetables."
2,Not quick and easy!,"My impression of a quick, easy recipe is one with few ingredients. Not in this book. Almost all of the recipes have 10 or more ingredients, way too many for me. At random I opened to a recipe which calls for 20 ingredients, including asafetida!"
3,"Overall, I liked the simplistic recipes.","I was dissappointed that the very first recipe I tried was missing an ingredient; Onion Fritters (page 20), the instructions say to add the water but it is not listed on the ingredients list so the amount is left to guesswork, which I promptly guessed wrong and ended up with a much soupier mixture, to which I had to add more gram flour to get it to the consistancy needed. Could someone query the author for the right amount of water? I only hope that this is the only recipe with an error in it."
5,good stuff,"I loved it. I read a great deal while traveling but only write review that are five stars as I don't have time for anythingless. This book I found to be very well put together, and researched, there might have been a few bumps or places I might have said maybe, but in general and as a whole, I love it and will recommend it to others. I am a member of the Aspen Book Club in Colorado, the Brooklyn Hatters Book Club, ""The Manhattan Book club"" the European book club and the Linnenbach Readers (Book) club. I have to say that I am on the move, on the road so often that read has become an outlet and using Amazons reader a great way to reduce the hours, 5 cheers to this author, I am very happy with this book and will recommend it to others."
2,Neither quick nor easy,"While the recipes in this book may be tasty, they certainly don't live up to the promise of the title. This may be a good book for the accomplished cook who wants to add some Indian recipes to their repertoire, but a beginner looking for truly easy versions of classic Indian favorites should look elsewhere."
4,Accessible Indian Food Every Day,"While this isn't the most comprehensive Indian cookbook I own, it is the one I reach for most often because it allows me to pull together an authentic-tasting meal any night of the week. Jaffrey's recipes are dependably good, her directions leave little room for confusion and she's developed a few great shortcuts that don't short-change flavor. Highly recommended."
4,Good for the Indian food loving novice,"I like this book because the instructions are clear and it contains variations on my favorite Indian foods. I found an Indian store, bought all the spices and am ready to go when I want a healthful, fairly easy to prepare chicken dish or Indian flavored meal."
4,"Easy Recipes, not so Authentic","I'm a huge fan of Madhur Jaffrey's show and her restaurants. Her style is to add an American flair to Indian cooking. While her recipes are fun and easy, they aren't pure authentic indian meals. They are, however, still interesting and tasty....just don't go to India expecting to see these items on a menu!"
5,Delivers as promised,"I have made three meals following the recipes from this book. In each case, I found the directions straight forward and the results delicious. I appreciate the extra commentary she adds. In particular, I opted to up the level of heat on the vindaloo to make it more authentic. I also appreciate her use of western ingredients (e.g. grainy mustard) to make it easier to find all of the required ingredients or simplify the preparation.I would recommend this to anyone who loves Indian food and is just starting to cook it."
1,Absurdity,"For the love of ... man?If you want to write a scientific article, write a scientific article. If you want to write a tabloid piece, write a tabloid piece. But if you want to conflate the two, with a good dose of genetic determinism and banal social stereotypes thrown in ... well, please don't write at all.Sykes lays the entire history of misogyny on the tender back of a Y chromosome, and then treats its hypothetical demise as some sensational revenge of womankind.""Many people would rejoice at the extinction of men,"" he writes on page 298. His evidence? A solitary, mentally imbalanced woman who once aimed a shot at Andy Warhol.This Boys v. Girls theme makes what could have been an interesting premise an exhausting and immature jaunt into hyperbole.Not to mention all 305 pages could aptly have been communicated in 20. In this case, Bryan's Curse seems to be want of a good editor."
1,This book sucks,"If you casually read the book's jacket you'd probably think this book is about evolutionary biology:""In Adam's Curse, Brian Sykes - one of the world's foremost geneticits- investigates the possibility of a man-free future...""Unfortunately its not a book about science at all, although Mr. Sykes would like you to believe that it is for it sure has all the trappings of science, without any of the rigor. Read with a critical eye, the book's jacket tells you exactly what this book is about...one man's (a man who happens to be a scientist) self-hatred about being a man. Here is one (loaded) question the books advertises to answer:""Are the male trademarks of greed, aggression and promiscuity genentically based?"" hmmm...not a loaded question? How about men who are altruistic, caring, and faithful? Simply put this book is crap.One more critisism: As you read this book, you keep saying to yourself...""get to the point already!"" The book has been horribly edited (if there was editing at all!)."
2,Disappointing,"OK, I loved Sykes' book ""The Seven Daughters of Eve."" So I wanted to read this one as well. Very disappointing. For one thing, I couldn't care less about the mating and reproductive habits of insects. For another, while I understand his wish to clarify things scientifically, I thought some of his opinions about women and homosexuality were pretty outlandish. There were a few interesting things in the book. The parts about Ghengis Khan would be one example.But my biggest issue with the book is that Sykes seems to have gotten way too full of himself and way too focused on ""being a writer."" Please! Do I really care what the weather was like or what the library looked like when he got idea XYZ? What made the other book so engaging was that he was just telling about the excitement of the discovery process and some of the possibilities for these women who many of us are descended from."
4,Adam's Curse,"This was an excellent follow-up to ""The Seven Daughters of Eve"". It provides insight into the origin of human life based on genetic testing and historical events. It is a great balance of scientific data and recorded history, with all the intrigue of a mystery novel. The author maintains his factual focus throughout the book with the exception of Chapter 21, in which he momentarily mutates into a flaming liberal, explaining how ""The blind rage of the male..... deliberately enslaved the female"". In all other chapters he maintains a scientific focus on ""natural selection"", concluding with a carefully calculated prediction about the demise of the Y chromosome."
2,"First half, interesting - second half, offensively ridiculous","Sykes is a great writer, and he makes the history of science much more fascinating than it probably actually was. But still, a great way to discover how we came to know the things we know.Then the story tries to explain what is happening (and what will happen). Prepare for your intelligence to be insulted. After explaining that sex exists because genes are trying to preserve themselves, he overlooks the little fact that you only have 1/32 of your great-great-grandparent's genes, so the ""selfish"" genes aren't doing a very good job of sticking around. His book is rife with contradictions - see if you can discover the ones involving dandelions, gay genes, and more.Genes don't plan ahead; Sykes comes across as some kind of animist that sees spirits in genes instead of trees. I talked to two other colleagues, all of us scientists, who had the exact same experience. Enjoyed the first half, never finished the rest."
5,Learning About DNA,"Bryan Sykes is such an entertaining writer that he can make science come alive! In 'A FUTURE WITHOUT MEN', Sykes opens our eyes to how much of our lives is controlled by our inherited genes and chromosomes. If a bee's behavior in the hive is entirely produced by DNA, how much of human behavior (even book-writing behavior) is demanded by our genes?We have often wondered if the criminal in prison had as much choice in his behavior as the court has accused. Now we learn, as we must have also suspected, that sexual preference is determined in the womb.In exploring Sykes' book, we learn that humanity, Nature's most extravagant experiment, is doomed. Somehow, we suspected that too."
4,Very Interesting,"Okay, I have not read the other reviews so as not to be biased. I would like for several of my friends to read this book. I think it is very good, but after I tell them it is a about the genetics involving the inheritance of the Y-chromosome they ask me if it is too technical. I do not think so, but then again I work as a plant breeder and I have a fairly good knowledge of basic genetics. I consider this book to be more like ""coffee table"" science compared to the professional journals and books I read. That said, I think this book is very well written and approachable with Dr. Sykes once again doing an excellent job of intertwining genetics, statistics and narrative. The subject matter is of ineterest to all. I encourage those of you who are purists who only read modern or classic literature and those of you who stick to just one genre of fiction or non-fiction to break out of your mold and give this a read."
2,"Adam's Curse, Sykes' Albatross","If you are interested in a whimsical, theoretic idea that may become relevant in 125,000 years, then this book is for you. (...)"
3,amazing book,I am an Ophthalmologist working in Saudi Arabia.I read this interest book.Some points may be benefit.I would like to ask the author about the millet seed eye pillow and pinhole glasses. Can any body send sample for me at Saudi Arabia and what about the cost.Finaly many thanks with my best wishs. N.B.e-mail:mostafa@uqu.edu.sa
1,FARCE!,Where is the medical research that backs this book up? Think twice before believing everything you read!
4,"It's not all that great, but it's still good.","This isn't exactly the best Hanson cd out there. I didn't like it too much, because it was mostly someone else talking about Hanson. They hardly said anything. I prefer other interview disks where Hanson does most of the talking. Also, most of the information is stuff that most Hanson fans should know. However, I do recommend it for big Hanson fans. It comes with a book as well. Most of the pix have been seen before, but if you love to collect Hanson memorabilia, then I'd say that this is a good addition to your collection. Otherwise, I'd suggest you spend your money on ""This Time Around"" or ""Middle of Nowhere"""
1,Hanson Rocks....NOT!,"I think that this CD is one of their worst. Even though it's not music, who wants to hear an British man talk about how they got started and more? It's not like the truly devoted Hanson fan doesn't already know this stuff. I think Hanson could have done much better. I USED to be a Hanson fan, but lately they've been kind of...boring. Overall, I think Hanson has more potential and could have done a better job."
3,For New Graduates,"This book had some good ideas and resources, but is really for new graduates. I have been an educator for 20 years, so many of the suggestions were not appropriate for those with my level of expertise. I would recommend it only for those thinking they may not want to be in a classroom setting or for those who may not be able to find a job."
1,Very Pleased,The battery life is superb when you use Energizer Lithium Batteries. The mouse is a nice little package and works well with any Macbook - the only downside is that it doesn't come in white and they are really a piece of junk that loses the connection all the time.
4,logical logitech,"I chose this mouse after reading a lot of the reviews on it, and most of them are true. It's a good choice for a wireless bluetooth mouse even though it uses standard batteries."
4,Bluetooth V270,It works fine with my laptop which has Bluetooth installed. I am disappointed that it doesn't offer some of the features that Logitech offers in other mice.
5,Best Bluetooth Mouse Yet.,"First bluetooth mouse that operates perfectly.. Resync's great when a restart is required & fits my hand like a glove.. For You Mac Fans it matches my MBPcolor to a ""T""..Lastly, very easy to install using OS X, took about 1 minute & it was up & running.."
5,Great WIth an Apple PowerBook,This little mouse works well with my Apple Powerbook and MacBook Pro. It has a range of about 20 feet and is great for presentations. Be sure to adjust your system pref. for speed or the tracking will be a little slower than most people would like. Battery life is good and the pouch that comes with it makes it shock resistant and easy to store in your backpack. I have owned this mouse for about a year and use it in my class for presentations. Students like it as much as I do and several have purchased this mouse to use with their laptops.
4,Compact Convenience,"If this was 20% bigger, it would be perfect. It's a lot smaller than it looks in the picture - could be RSS waiting to happen for those with larger hands. Otherwise, I love it. The bluetooth works flawlessly, the batteries last for months, and it's great having one less wire!"
4,Pretty solid,"I love the on/off switch and the included case, however the clicking is just slightly loud, and the movement is VERY sensitive. Also, the case, when closed, forces the mouse buttons into the down, or ""clicked"" position. It has yet to be an issue, but I wonder if it will wear down the buttons in the future. If not for those drawbacks, I would easily give it 5 stars."
1,V270 Disconnects all the time. Bad mouse!,"Bought this when my other mouse died, liked it because it didn't have a usb plug-in with it. However, it's turned out to be a dud and I'm going to buy something else. It disconnects EVERY DAY, at least once. I haven't been able to find a way to get the laptop to recognize it except with a full re-boot, which involves closing down all my applications, re-booting, and then pulling everything back up. Not Worth It! Don't buy this mouse!"
4,Nice mouse but it takes too long to wake up,"Great little mouse, but not really for everyday use on a desktop. It just takes too long to ""wake up"" after going into power save. You have to jiggle and click for a few seconds before you can use it. Annoying."
2,Good on paper,"The mouse looks great and the specs sound even better in the description, but it is an awful mouse ergonomically speaking. It's too small even for my tiny hands and after merely 5 minutes of using it, my wrist was hurting. It's also too light, which results in the need to grip it tightly, adding to the problem.Returning it today."
4,"Small, even for small hands, but good connection","I wanted a Bluetooth mouse, mainly because I didn't want to deal with the USB receiver. Just another part to lose or get in the way.The Bluetooth connection to my MacBook Pro was easy and they reconnect just fine. There's not much else to say. I've had the mouse for a month or so and haven't run down the battery yet, even with daily use.It is a small mouse. I have short, stout hands and even I think it's a bit small. Using it is different from my regular desktop mouse, with two fingers draped over the top for the two buttons, instead of using my forefinger for both.As with all Bluetooth mice, if you let it sit for a while, there is a small lag before it will respond."
1,Unsatisfied,"I got it for my Mac 17"" PowerBook to replace my 1 button Apple bluetooth mouse. I've also used an USB Logitech mouse for years enjoying it very much. This mouse is 'herky jerky'. It's like using the little dot mouse on a PC's keyboard; very hard to get going and control well. I've tried adjusting the settings, but that's yielded very little difference. I feel I've wasted my money. It sits in its little zippered pouch unused. One star."
4,Great bluetooth mouse,"Great mouse! I'm using it with my MacBook Pro and it didn't take instructions to get working. If you let it sit for a bit the ""wakeup"" time of the mouse is noticeable, but shouldn't be a problem for most people.Only con is that I think the scroll wheel has more resistance and is ""clicky-er"" than I'm used to from my mouse at work - but hey, I can get used to anything.Comes with a slick little neoprene carrying case for when you take it to go.I like the bluetooth connectivity because I didn't want to deal with any USB dongle hanging out of the side of my 'book.Enjoy!"
1,what a dissapointment,"the mouse worked great, for a week. i loved it (during the week it worked).then it just stopped working for no reason. if you get this mouse (and it seemed like a great mouse --when it worked) make sure you keep your receipt. my defective one may have been a fluke.. but be cautious anyways. i was very surprised becuase ive always had such great luck with logitech products."
4,"One of the best values for a bluetooth mouse, but....","PROS+ Comes with a protective pouch+ Easy installation and easy-to-use+ Very precise+ Nice software app for configuring the mouse pointer, click, and scroll speedCONS (some may be due to personal preference)- Weak ergonomic design - rear of the mouse is way too high, not allowing the wrist to remain as close to the surface as possible. This design create some wrist/shoulder strain- Uses 2 AA batteries, making it ""heavy"" relative to other mice, adding to the strain of the poor design"
1,Horrible Mouse!,"This mouse is absolutely horrible! You would think for spending $40 on a mouse, it would be a good one, well it's not. It says Vista certified, but works terribly. It takes forever to connect, and once it does, if you turn you computer off, you have to reconnect it every time! Also, the scroll wheel only works sometimes."
3,"Bluetooth - Excellent concept..., however...","It is an excellent concept, do not have to worry about pluging in to your laptop, however, it is heaver and bigger in size (compared to other wireless mouse). Nevertheless it does the job. I have given three stars just because of its cumbersome characterstic."
4,Quality Mouse,"This mouse works well with my G5 iMac. Bluetooth setup was painless.The only minor thing is the delay when you first move the mouse after it's been un-used for a bit. The second-or-so delay when it's been a minute or so since you used it isn't so bad, but it had me wondering at first if I was experiencing interference. I don't know if this is a common thing with Bluetooth Mice (Mouses?), but I know my Bluetooth keyboard doesn't do this.Battery life seems perfectly fine to me. There is a nice, real-life SWITCH for power on the underside - not a recessed button that has to be held for a few seconds. I like that."
2,Not comfortable to use,"This is the second time I bought this exact same mouse. I lost the first one that I bought early this year so I bought the same one again. However, unlike the first mouse, which I loved, I returned this mouse to Amazon because it hurts my hand when ever I use it. The left-mouse button which I use all time time is very hard to press that it hurts my palm and my entire hand within minutes of use. I did not have this problem on the first mouse so I don't know if I should buy a third mouse of the same kind. I really need a replacement blue tooth mouse, though, so maybe I will ..."
4,Great with a Catch,"No reception problems, fast, all the things a bluetooth mouse should be... except when my laptop goes to sleep, it sometimes (25%?) won't wake from sleep IF AND ONLY IF THE MOUSE IS ON. Annoying, but fixable as long as I remember to switch the mouse off when I'm going to let the laptop sleep. Still, I actually have to reboot if it accidentally happens."
5,Works with Vista but......,"You have to install by going to add new hardware on your computer. We tried using the install disc, didn't work. Went to the Logitech site, no luck. Once the mouse was installed, it worked like a charm. This is a Vista glitch, not a Logitech one."
4,Great size and performance,"This is my first bluetooth mouse and I have been pleasantly suprised with its aesthetic and functional value. I have used it for about 2 weeks, and I have not experienced any problems with lag, erratic pointing, or battery life. Lastly, I find that this mouse is much more precise than the corded Microsoft USB mouse I was using.I'm using the mouse with a 2005 ibook g4, and it literally took 30 seconds to set it up. I inserted the batteries; my mac discovered the mouse and that was it. The device is a bit heavy with two AA batteries installed; however, I wouldn't say that the weight is a hindrance at all.Overall I highly recommend."
5,As Advertised,I'm using this device to control a Media Center PC (from my couch) running my HD TV and it works great! As Advertised.
2,Bluetooth Mice Generally Suck!,"Compared to the Kensington Bluetooth mice, the Logitech is fine. If you compare the Logitech Bluetooth against optical mice, it's terrible. The V270 is not very precise, sometimes like slow-motion, and it can jump around on the screen. It's heavy and bulky, unlike the Kensington which felt awesome in my hand."
4,Good choice,If you have a Notebook with Bluetooth this is a good choice. Very simple and easy to setup.
2,Stopped working after a month,This bluetooth mouse was pretty expensive for something that stopped working after a month of normal operation.
1,Resetting Bluetooth every day not worth it,"This would have been worth five stars, if it weren't for my having to reset it every morning on my PowerBook G4. On top of that, after three days, it just stopped being discoverable altogether. Tried every possible perfmutation of settings, empty passkey, specific passkey, reconfigurinjg, you name it. It stopped working and customer service appears to be unresponsive. Not worth wasting my tiime with this."
5,Worked first time I turned it on,"Opened the package turned it on and the internal bluetooth in my Dell Latitude picked it up right away. Seems to have good response and I like the size for travel, along with travel pouch. It is not to small, but not the bulky size of a regular desk mouse. How a mouse fits each individual is always different, but I find it very comfortible."
3,"Good for portability, not so good for precision.","This a good mouse to have for travel since it is compact and doesn't require a receiver. Using it for anything other than navigating your computer though isn't as spectacular. There is a noticeable lag between moving the mouse and the pointer on the screen. If you're planning on using the mouse for precision tasks such as photoshop or for any kind of gaming I would recommend something different. (It could be possible that all wireless mice have this lag). It also doesn't work well off of a mouse pad. This is because of the battery saving technology built into the sensor that turns it off when the mouse isn't moving. The battery life, however, is great because of this feature."
1,Problem maintaining bluetooth connection,"Intermittent disconnects with a new, bluetooth enabled Dell laptop. Other bluetooth devices work fine with the Dell, so I'm assuming the issue is with the mouse. Also, it requires a logitech driver, the laptop couldn't connect at all without the driver. Too bad, I was really hoping this would work as intended - the idea is nice."
5,"Connects quickly, works great","The mouse works really well. It makes a quick and reliable connection. Ergonomic size and form-factor!Note: If you lose the connection and have trouble pairing it with your computer again, hold the reset button down (to make the mouse discoverable). This will establish a more reliable and longer-term pairing."
4,Bluetooth mouse,"Works fine. Not quite as good as a cordless usb mouse, but close enough. I like the bluetooth technology."
1,Logiteck Bluetooth Mouse,"Don't like it at all. Operation is sluggish, erractic and does not have the fine control of a standard optical or the BT MICRO mouse. 2 BT Micro mouse failed within weeks but the Logitec is OK in the reliabiltiy area. I tried resetting the ControlPanel Mouse options to gain better control but the the cursor movement is still not good. It is slow to start and then overshoots or the cursor floats: just very squirely. One lacks postive control with this Logitech. Would like to have a reliable BT Micro much more."
4,Nice mouse. Nice price.,"This is my first bluetooth mouse to compliment my new Dell XPS notebook. I have large hands so i really like the full size. The travel mice are to small for me. I like the feel and responsiveness of this mouse and the bluetooth technology is great. No more usb connection or cords. However, this mouse does have a small glitch that other reviewers have mentioned. It will occasionally stop working for 5-10 seconds. You just have to click the mouse button or wiggle the mouse and it will connect again. It seems to be a bluetooth issue and it disconnects from time to time. Not a huge problem if you have patients. Even came with a cloth case. Overall a nice mouse at a nice price. I give it 4 stars."
1,Great Paperweight,"I bought this mouse a year or so ago and it worked great for the first 2 hours. Now it disconnects so frequently that it is a much better paperweight than anything else. I tried numerous versions of SetPoint, which wasn't supported in Vista when I bought the mouse but even when I installed XP again the mouse still failed. Needless to say I purchased a LX 710 keyboard/mouse combo that I am very happy with. It looks like they discontinued this mouse in favor of the V470 which I will avoid at all costs due to my experience with this one."
1,Incompatible,I had to return this item when it would not work with our Dell Inspiron E1705 with Windows Vista operating system.
1,Buyer Beware!,"The packaging indicates that this is the 1947 remake with John Hodiak and Sylvia Sidney, which is what I wanted; the DVD inside, however, is the 1937 original, with Basil Rathbone. Very irresponsible merchandising--indeed, false advertising."
4,does the trick,Works really well. 4 stars only because the padded sleeves are a pain with higher weight. Would be better just to remove pads and use athletic tape.
1,Incomplete,I just got my GoFit wrist blaster today. Apparently people can't pack right whick resulted in me missing the piece that holds the weights on. Quality....
1,Missing a part,Both the original order and the attempted re-order were missing the same parts (the plate that holds the weights on the end of the rope and the nut that holds the plate on the bolt at the end of the rope) when the item arrived. I think that this is a design flaw in the packaging.
5,great strenght trainer,I recived this product 2day. I opened the package and was surprised of how solid and durable this product was. The rope is firm and is a great workout tool. I opened the package and used it and gave me a great forearm and wrist workout. U can feel the intensity. I had 30 lbs on the machine and it was very strong and held up perfect. I love this thing and recommend it for anyone who loves working out and getting stronger
1,Missing Parts,"Received mine today. Just like some of the other customers mentioned below, mine was also missing the same parts:- the plate that holds the weights on the end of the rope- the nut that holds the plate on the bolt at the end of the ropeWill end up making a trip to the hardware store to purchase those parts. Starting off with a bad first impression, but here's hoping that the quality of this product is good."
5,Awesome!,"This $15 device is great for isolating forearms for a killer workout! I took off the foam grips and put on rubber BMX bike grips, able to get a much better grip now. I also hung it from cargo straps from Home Depot to isolate my forearms. I simply took the loop end of the strap and put it around the bar. The hook end of the strap is hanging from ceiling hooks. By far the best forearm workout I have found yet!The only thing I don't like is the way the rope coils while you are pulling up the wait. It tends to move the workout toward the arm that the rope is coiling towards. A flat strap would work much better....that will be the next mod.Also, I can see how these are arriving with missing parts. My washer and nut were rolling around free in the Amazon box. I assumed they fell out of the cheap clamshell package."
1,Missing washer and nut,Please send washer and nut for my order! I read several reviews saying this product was shipped with missing parts but did not think it would happen to me. I will post feedback again after issue is resolved
2,Incomplete,"I bought this product after reading the negative reviews because I thought, ""What are the chances it will be shipped with missing pieces to ME"". Well, it was shipped incomplete to ME. Now I have to go to the store and buy a washer and a nut that fits. Dumb people like this is what gives small businesses a bad name.Gave 2 stars because once i purchase those items, i'm sure it will work as intended."
1,Poor Construction - hand grip glue doesn't stick,I was hesitant having seen reviews for this and similar looking and named wrist rollers for which customers posted reviews warning about the hand-grip glue. The VERY FIRST TIME I USED this wrist roller after receiving it one of the two hand-grips came unglued. Mind you this was with only 10 LBS attached to it. Beware!
5,good review,"my mum got me this toy for my birthday, i convinced her to let me have it early. this toy is build way better then the american beastwars its very sturdy and would be able to take a beating better then any of the others i have"
2,"Too crispy, too big and too many","I bought a case of these to make some desserts. I had no idea I would get so many in each 7 oz. package, or that they would be so big, or that they would be so crunchy. Taste is fine. Just know that if you're making a dessert and you expect the ladyfingers to suck up the sauce or sherry or liqueur, buy more sauce/sherry/liqueur than you planned!"
4,Interesting,I was rushing to see this when it came out. This was a good continuance of the previous seasons. I recommend watching from season 1 or you will be totally lost.
3,Smiled but then frowned,"First off let me tell you: I LOVE THE KILLERS... I've bought their cd 3 times. The first time was the domestic edition 11 songs. Then I saw the import that had a bonus track and a video so I paid 19.99 plus tax for it. Then I saw the TOUR EDITION with 14 songs and a dvd with the videos!! So I paid 40 dollars for it. I also bought some singles since some of them are hard to find. One those singles was ""Smile Like You Mean It""; Now I love ""Smile Like You Mean It"" and I was really excited to see a B-Side but when I listened to it I was like ""I PAID 12 BUCKS FOR THIS SONG?!"" This song is soooooooo much different from THE KILLERS I/We know it is soooooooo weird but somehow it makes you listen to it even though you don't really like it. The lyrics are somewhat dark and you don't really understand what he (BRANDON) is saying cos he is not really singing. For FANATICS (LIKE ME) ONLY!!"
4,Desert Landscape Architecture,"I purchased this reference book when I was the chairman of our community's landscape committee. It was a very helpful reference for identifying and selecting desert shrub, trees, etc."
2,Needed sharpening out of the box!,The knife arrived with a nasty burr on the cutting edge. I had to run it through my sharpener (also Wusthof) for a few minutes before I had a usable cutting edge. After that it cuts fine. I expected better from such a reputable manufacturer.
2,Drivel,This book tries to be all things to all people and fails miserably. To charge $140+ for this book should be illegal. Somewhere in the $6-$8 dollar range would be more appropriate.
2,too expensive,"why is this book so expensive, content was fine but not so sure if it was along the line of 100+ dollars."
4,Sewing Freak,Was in college for Information Technology. What I read of this book was very helpful. I would recommend this book.
4,It works but be careful on how much dog food you plan to put in it.,I needed an airtight container for dog food. I only buy the 17 lb bags so this works great. It fills it about 3/4ths full. The air tight seal looks like its working and the fastener seems to seal it well. I don't use the wheels as it just sits in the pantry on the floor.
5,"Keeps dog food clean, dry, and secure.","I received the product quickly. The rollers were easy to insert and the lid fits securely and opens easily. It holds a complete 20# bag of dog food, keeping it fresh. It rolls out of the way easily and is much more attractive than a big open bag of dog food."
4,Gets the Job Done,The container holds a 17.5lb bag of Science Diet Indoor Cat Chow with about 3-4 inches to spare. The label says it hold 25lbs of cat chow but I do not see how that is possible. The wheels are nice and the seal is tight.
2,Container with Wheels,"I bought 4 of these containers to store dog food and cat food in. The problem is, none of the wheels would stay attached to the container and any lifting of the container and the wheels fell off. Save your money and buy the ones with no wheels. The container itself is nice and I like the hinged lid fits tight. I wasted my money buying these as the wheels are useless."
1,"OK product, lid breaks off",This product is ok but hte lid is connected on two little pegs and it doesn't tak elong for them to break off and then the seal on the lid is not really a seal anymore...I am gonna try a Rubbermaid next time.
1,You'd really have to love the show to buy this disc!,"I looked forward to receiving this disc and was greatly dissapointed! The material used was sliced, chopped-up 16mm prints. The picture is dark and the sound is low. ONE STEP BEYOND was a great show and you'll enjoy seeing the shows again but the poor quality video will take away from that."
4,lots of laughs!,"My almost three year-old grandson loves this! It's all in the delivery, how it is read. Very sweet without any negative overtones or less than desirable language. I read it once on Christmas morning to him, and he immediately wanted me to read it again."
3,Why all the laudatory reviews ?,"This is the first novel of Littell's that I've read and I wasn't impressed. Actually about halfway through I began skimming, looking for something to happen. Littell certainly has an eye for Moscow street scenes, as well as an ear for the rudeness with which Russians treat each other. But his characters, from the insufferable Aida to the doltish Bassett to the misanthropic Manny, are all unlikable. Why would the reader care what happens to them ? You just want them to shut up."
1,Left my hair sticky and frayed,"I tried this several times, applying it to slightly damp hair, and damp hair, and wet hair.It always left my hair looking frizzy. I have thick hair. What I use now is Murray's black bees wax. It's about 10 times cheaper, and I look like Tom Cruise."
2,Buyer beware - it's only 1.75oz,"I made the mistake of purchasing these, thinking they were of the 3oz variety. The product IS as advertised, but I thought I was purchasing the 3oz jar for a cheaper price. That's my bad and hence why a 2-star review and not a 1. They are fleecing folks for $10+ per jar of 1.75oz when the 3oz costs $13+ (almost twice the amount for 33% higher cost). This rating is also to reflect the cost/value.I personally feel that the seller is pricing these higher to intentionally and accidentally get orders for people making the same mistake that I made. Those are my business instincts talking, but admittedly complete speculation. Let my loss be your lesson. Don't buy these and get the 3oz jar."
2,Boo!,"I gave this product a shot about an hour ago, and was not at all pleased with the results.First of all - the creme has a strong smell and is not necessarily the most pleasant. Secondly, you should use this product if you want to have a spiked/hair standing up sort of look. My hair usually curls when I use gel/putty, but with this it adopted a strange, angled, straighter look. Did not leave my hair looking like anything of good quality. Not terribly difficult to wash out, but not a straight shot either. Shampooed once and rinsed with warm water only to feel some residue still on my hair.On the other hand, I tried American Crew's alcohol-free styling gel - now that stuff is good. Feels light on your head b/c of the lack of alcohol (and whatever else is in it).. smells very pleasant and with an appropriate odor strength, and leaves your hair looking good - with decent hold and shine - whether you comb forward or backward."
1,Doesn't work,This product didn't work at all. Every time I used it I suffered through a night of severe diarrhea. It also tastes terrible so I don't know why I tried it again anyway. It's my own stupid fault. It does spread nicely on toast without tearing the bread. So there's that.
2,Not what I expected,"After using Alterna stlying products for years, I had to change due to their discontinuing of their styling concrete. I ordered this item on a blind buy based on the reviews of others. The product does not hold nearly as strong as Alterna concrete and the texture is too smooth and silky for my liking. If there is a positive, little shine and it smells good. Simply not what I was hoping for for my shorter hair."
5,I love it!!,"to show you how great CREW hair care products are, they have managed to get on the shelves at high-end salons, despite the fact that salons go out of their way to just by products that are not sold in stores, so that way you have to buy it there and they can charge high mark-ups. they are willing to lose sales (from people like me that just buy it online, knowing it is not exclusive to salons) as it is such a great product. there is no other hair product i can say this about.this on the other hand, is not only one that all the top stylists use, but one that you can get at a reasonable price both at the salon and online. whatever your stylist uses that you like, go on amazon, and you will see it is much cheaper."
2,"Great product, but I wouldn't buy from here.","This is a great product, but my review is based off the seller. I've purchased this twice from here and both times the product was much more dry than normal. It made it difficult to spread on my hands and work into my hair, often resulting in white chunks of wax in my hair. I finally just recently decided to go purchase a new jar at Target, and it works so much better and is not dry at all. This seller must have this stuff sitting in the warehouse for a while causing it to dry out or something.Maybe it was just a fluke, but it happened twice to me. Think I'd rather pay the two extra dollars and buy it from a store to ensure it's fresh."
4,Another great Crew product,"The only knock on this product is that it doesn't spread evenly throughout your hair as well as other Crew products do. But, in general, it provides a great hold without much shine. I prefer Crew Forming Cream but you can't really go wrong with any of the Crew products."
2,Flakes - looked like dandruff,"After reading the reviews of Fiber, I decided to give it a shot. But once I started Fiber, I noticed I would get white flakes in my hair. I didn't think it was Fiber at first - I thought I had dandruff! I've never had dandruff, so I was concerned. Even my hair stylist said ""looks like you have dandruff"" and recommended a dandruff shampoo she sells.After her shampoo didn't work, I thought ""you know, this all started when I started using Fiber"". So I tried another product and stopped using the dandruff shampoo. Sure enough, flakes are gone. Ever since then, I've been flake-free (it's been 6+ months). No dandruff shampoo and a new product - no problems. In other words, it's pretty conclusive that it was Fiber causing the flakes."
3,It's OK,"After using American Crew Structure for the past couple years, this product was not what I was loooking for and its consistency didn't work well with my hair."
2,Its Ok,this is my first time using this type of hair styling cream. i decided to get it because sports clips used it on me and i liked the smell. but this isnt the kind they used apparently. i doesnt smell too good and doesnt see to hold too well. I am just going to experiment.
4,"One of the best,not THE best.","The other day I decided to try something besides my usual matte clay. I had a couple products in mind,so I went to Target. I couldn't find either of those products,but I did find this. So I spent 19 dollars on it and went home. The next morning I used it in my hair,doing my typical hair routine. I found that it doesn't hold Medium-ish hair very well. It felt very strong,but it didn't stay in my hair all day. It left my hair feeling fuzzy and kind of dry. Overall,this product probably works amazingly with short hair,but anything longer isn't going to work very well."
4,Good,Have used this price in the past. Very good for matte finish and pretty good on hold. Doesn't take much for each use. The 3oz should last quite a while.
3,Good and Bad,"Good: it looks like your hair just does what you want it to do. Bad: your hair also just does what the wind and the elements want.I get up shower, style and looks good. I go out in the windy San Francisco area and when I see myself in the mirror... horrible. Might just be my hair length. I think this will be 5 stars in the summer. We'll see."
2,Hard to work with,"I like AC's daily moisturizing shampoo which left my hair w/volume and softness. However, this gel is hard to work with. In dry hands, it's too pasty so you have to rub your hands together vigorously to get this to spread and put on your hair evenly. In wet hands, it just crumbles and won't work. Don't get me wrong, when you put this stuff in your hair, it will give it a hold without the ugly flaking and you can still get your hands through, though this stuff is slightly greasy. I think American Crew is a pretty good line of inexpensive products for hair. This product just needs some other ingredient in it to make it more pliable."
3,Not so bad,I have tried many of fiber products and I find this one to be way to thick. Price is cheaper than the rest of them but u get what u pay for. Not bad for the price but no my favorit
4,Good product,"I bought this for my husband. He really likes this brand of hair gel. It lasts for quite a while too. It doesn't take much to style hair either, about a quarter size amount. Good price for how long the product lasts."
5,Best book about monitor lizards!,This is easily the best book about keeping monitor lizards. The authors have so much experience and it shows! They even provide a section about the lizards in the wild. The advice on care and husbandry is far better than what I've found in any other book. These guys really know what they are talking about!
1,not good on kindle,"Got this book for my kindle and the print was so small. Couldn't read it. Im sure the book is ok, but the kindle version wasn't worth it"
5,A Must Have for any monitor owner! Best book out there!,"This is the best monitor book out there. Easy to read and very informative about making a proper habitat, proper diet, and proper heating requirements. Also touches on Savannah monitors in the wild and how this relates to monitors in captivity. Excellent book, a must have for any monitor owner."
4,Scamper the Penguin,"Pretty good for an old school movie. DVD arrived in great shape and works perfectly! Unfortunately the case suffered some damage at some point during shipping, but other than that it was a good deal."
2,Love it!,"My son is two and he likes this DVD better than elmo. It's fun, cute and educational. I really recommend it."
1,I Just Don't Get It,"First, let me say that ""violence"" in nature does not bother my family. Although I have never eaten penguin, our freezer is full of a variety of fish and wild game. So watching hungry seagulls snatch a few penguin eggs does not bother us in the least. However, I just do not see any point or plot in the story whatsoever. It seems nothing more to me than an animated documentary. Further, the accompanying background music swings unpredictably from a happy, carefree state to dark/somber/ominous mood. I didn't know how I was supposed to feel from scene to scene. Overall, I was left feeling very confused. I am thankful to have rented this one from the library."
5,Only movie I remember growing up,"I don't remember much from my childhood. I remember Cabbage Patch Kids, Glow Worms, and Scamper.I used to watch this movie over and over and over. The story kept me completely enthralled. I remember being very stimulated by it, always thinking. I was obsessed. I think it's a must have for kids. It's great, will keep kid occupied, and isn't annoying at all.Another reviewer on here commented about how negative an infulence it is. It's not, at all. They're really just probably the type of parents who shelter their child from everything, think their kid can do no wrong, and everything that is wrong with parents these days, because there seriously isn't anything negative about this movie."
5,To the point,"I liked this book because too many books and movies speculate about her life and add things that they couldn't have known as fact.This book is the questioned asked of her and her answers. It's not written as a story or even a biography. It's very straight foward without narration. It was very to the point, which is what I liked most."
3,powerful,"This is a powerful story. And I've sampled many of the books about Joan of Arc. I like this one the most. The transcripts show how clever, witty, and human she was."
4,May tempt you to want to know more about her,"I was introduced to this brief book because of my 13 year old daughter's biography assignment. The book was abstracted and translated from French into English and consists only of ""her own words"" in the form of letters and documents which have accumulated over the years and been studied by scholars.While not a book I could say would bring a complete understanding of Joan's life, it was intriguing to read her own interpretation of the events in her life. A little deep towards the end, especially for a young reader, it never the less did prove to be provoking and we enthusiastically probed other mediums to find more background information.The story is so full of emotion and controversy it is sure to prompt contemplation and conversation. From my experience, it was worth the read to listen to my 13 year old reflect on what it would be like to be living in Joan's time and if you were Joan. All in all, both of us had a positive experience from the book."
5,Excellent,"This is a unique and worthwhile presentation of the life of Joan of Arc. It takes all of her statements which appear in random places in the trial transcripts and orders them chronologically. Since it contains only quotes by Joan, discriptions of the surrounding events are missing. However, for anyone already familiar with the context, this is a great collection and a valuable companion piece to other complete biographies. I will read this volume many times."
5,Compelling,"Reading Jehanne's own words is simply an amazing experience. The way the book is written, you can almost hear her speaking with all the passion & fervor she posessed. Reading this book is like being there, back in time, actually watching & hearing all as it happens."
3,great but we need more,"tough to give more stars to this collection when it includes only two songs from her finest album: Between the Lines (two great songs but there are at least another three songs that shouldve been included) bottom line this shouldve been a two disc set, whats there is great though"
1,not worth the money,"I reviewed a variety of audio preamps. I needed two channels and little sophistication in the device. I purchased this GE product because I thought the brand name would represent some degree of reliability. What I recieved was a device with one working channel and one totally inoperative channel. The single channel which is working is adiquate, but I thought I would have two. If this random sample of one represents what you want when you buy GE, go ahead and purchase. But, you have been warned, GE is no better than any off shore no name brand. The wrapper is written by a native English speaker and other indications looked good. The product is a failure."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"I order a new pre-amp, and pretty sure I was shipped a used one. There was no manufacturer's packaging, absolutlely no paperwork of any kind, no instructions, specs, warrenty, NOTHING! Not even the name of the company that shipped it. It came in a plain package. As you can see the product comes with print on the top of it. Part of that was rubbed off as if it was used.Also beware, it does not come with a power cord even though it has a jack for a 9V power supply."
4,GOOD BOOK,"I found this book to be inersting and hold my attention throughout. . If you would like to read a beautiful novel that you can't put down that willtouch your heart, and every emotion you have ever known, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher.. ."
3,Not my cup of tea,This was another one related to the Wind Dancer which I loved but I'm just not crazy about this 'era' regardless of the fact that it's historically related to the 'current' Wind Dancer.
4,It was a good story,i love Iris but jean and julit was great but their sex at the begining was quite hard ...... but Francois and catherine were great a deep love story and a very moving one i love their love story vvvvvvvv much
3,"Superb Cast and Camera-work, not a great DVD","Heston's film debut is a lot of fun -- he's charming, sturdy, conflicted and overwrought. The plot is entertaining and clever, but filled with more than its share of improbable plot devices. The cinematography is deftly noirish. But the film really belongs to the brilliant supporting cast: Dean Jagger, the frequently under-rated Elizabeth Scott, Ed Begley, Harry Morgan, and Jack Webb. We know what Heston was to become, so it's a pleasure to watch him at this point in his career surrounded by real pros who effectively round out each scene and the film as a whole.It's a four-star movie but it gets three because of the DVD. There was about 5 minutues of horizonotal waviness half-way through the film, and isolated pops and crackles on the soundtrack. Still well worth it for any fan of the genre, though."
4,More 50s than 40s.,"During a rigged card game, a rube (an over-the-top and impossibly naive Don DeFore) gets taken for money he doesn't have and he commits suicide. From there on, its just a matter of time before justice catches up with the bad guys. Twist and turns? Not really. The only question is, will Charlton Heston be redeemed, and given the character he plays, it seems likely. Dark City is nicely written and Charlton Heston is undeniably very good. But somehow, this dark city isn't terribly dark. I can't think of one scene that stands out although there is an odd moment when Heston's character, Danny tells the widow ""He didn't have to play and he didn't have to commit suicide"". Coming when it does, the comment is so spot-on, it seems almost amusing. DVD quality is excellent and its always nice to see Lizabeth Scott, but I took off a star for too many musical numbers and for the predictability of the whole thing. Definitely worth seeing, but its not Out Of The Past."
4,"Very good picture . Great Heston , right out of the gate","Once i saw the terrific cast ; Jack Webb , Ed Begley (Sr) , Harry Morgan , Dean Jagger , Viveca Lindfors and ""introducing"" Charton Heston , I knew i was in for a good picture . When i saw William Dieterle was the director , i KNEW it . My wife and i were not familiar with the woman who crooned so well and was Heston's character's love interest . This is a fine little thriller . It's well written and equally well acted . Others here and elsewhere can give you the particulars of plot and story . Suffice to say , i'll be getting a copy of this 1950 film soon . If you can stream , check it out . If you can't , trust us . It's a good one . They CAN'T make them like this anymore . This is a ""story"" with ""people"" and no C.G.Why ? Get here ."
3,Why Olive Films???,Dark City is a 4 star movie that deserves much better than the third rate Olive Films. Unfortunately Olive has been releasing older films wihout any sdh or subtitles and wanting over $20 for them-old movies deserve better and so do people that need CC or subtitles. Shame!!
5,Good book,"My husband first got this book at the library, then wanted to order one himself to teach himself some basic piano. He felt it was good enough to want to purchase one for himself."
5,It Really Is Everything!,"I love this book! It is well written and fun to read. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the piano. The author not only gives ""how to"" instruction for learning to play the piano, he also educates the reader on the history and care of your instrument of choice. The book has the feel of having a friend help you make informed decisions about your piano purchase. This book could be especially helpful to parents of a budding musician who will be buying his first piano. The book is also helpful for those who want to learn to play. The first songs are simple with step by step instruction and make learning fun. This is an excellent book."
4,Photoshop Elements on steroids!,"As an avid user of PE and having seen a variety of lessons and partial tutorials on the use of layers in PE, I was grateful to find Ted's book where everything is in one place. It is well organized and detailed, allowing me to follow along with ease. I expect it would be a boon for a newer user also, especially the included CD-ROM with several important lessons given as video tutorials. The price of the book is worth it for this alone. Overall a great buy. My only beef is that the images used in the examples were not (as is often typical)on the CD.I personally enjoy duplicating the lessons with the actual pictures used. This is a minor point, however, and overall I would highly recommend this book."
5,Combining images with Photoshop Elements.,As usual Photoshop Elements is a subject I am very attached to and here is a publication that helps to make the most of this programme.
4,Great U3 drive,"I've only had this USB flash drive for about 3 weeks now, but it works great! I did extensive research before I bought the drive and everything I found on it was true. The transfer speeds are at least 3 times that of my old PNY 2GB drive. I've installed several U3 programs with no trouble and uninstalled them with no problem. You do have to be careful when inserting the drive into a USB port a tight place. The drive is pretty big and usually there is no room for anything else to fit beside it in the other USB port. The Signupshield program is great."
4,"Hardware is great, software is not.",I will keep this short and sweet.This thumb drive is fast. 2 gigs copyed in 4 minutes. Also the slip and slide action of the mechanism is easily learned no problem for me even with fat swollen hands.
4,"With some quirks, but cool.","I just got my Contour in the mail today, and I'm already impressed, more than I was before. First of all, the design is really nice, with a good metal shell on the bottom (most of the drive is plastic though). The U3 system still has some quirks (shadow instances that prevent easy plug-and-play use of the drive), but is pretty good still since my first U3 drive. I have yet to see the full capabilities of ReadyBoost, but it looks interesting, and at least I can have 4 GB of 'extra RAM' and still have plenty of space for other stuff.One big quibble I have with it is the opening/closing mechanism is kind of annoying. The idea seems simple enough, but I was under the impression that there was a spring that helped to ease the process; nope...not so much. Maybe that's something that should be added to alleviate the frustrations of many Contour owners."
4,"Great drive, but...",I am very pleased with the access speeds and the preloaded apps work well. The only issue of note is that I use it largely with my laptop and the docking station is elevated leaving the rather substantial weight of the drive unsupported. I bought a USB extension cable and lay it on the desk. Other than that I am very pleased with the entire product.
1,"Fast drive, poor hardware","While this flash drive seemed great at first, it died completely after 5 moths of light use. Avoid if you count on your flash drive to be reliable."
1,SanDisk 8GB Cruzer Contour USB Drive (retail Package),Too good to be true. This company canceled my order without any good explanation. Probably because it was a 8 gb key for less than $30. I even went to their website to make sure the price was correct and they had it listed on their website as well for less than $30. I will not buy from this company at all in the future. It was available and in stock and Amazon had a disclaimer that this was sold directly through PC Universe and not Amazon. I should have known better. Thought I got the deal of a century. I saw bad reviews from this company and should have known better too.
1,the worst product I have purchased from Amazon!,"DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE! DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE! DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE! DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE!I am sorry to say, this USB Thumb drive is without a doubt the worst thing I have ever purchased on Amazon!Just trying to physically plug it in to a laptop is an exercise in futility! The physical operation of this drive is ridiculous.Trying to delete the 'free' junk software off this drive seems to be impossible.DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE! DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE! DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE! DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE!"
2,"Good innards, bad shell","A fairly good usb drive in terms of read / write speeds, but I just cant get past the outer shell of this one.It's meant to look pretty and have sort of a switchblade feel - you retract the black portion about 1/2"" then return it to the starting position to get the connector out. When done you push it forward 1/2"" past the starting position then back. During the process there is a little flap that covers the connector when it is recessed.The motion isn't very smooth, and it feels like there are multiple points of failure on this drive. Also because you have to move the slider in the correct order if it jammed in the wrong spot it could be a real pain to fix.It works well as a USB drive, but if there is another one for the same price I'd suggest it over this one."
2,Plastic!,"Got the SanDisk Titanium 2 & 4GB Cruzer. Needed more storage and went with the 8GB Contour. Was waiting for it since December of 06 and not happy about SanDisk changing the Feb or March release date by two months. Thought they had their reasons and I would wait for their quality product. Simply, this device isn't meant for heavy use. The black part in the picture is thin plastic. As you push on it to open and close the drive, you can feel a little give in the plastic. It comes with a nice protective case but, for the price, I was expecting something like their Titanium Cruzers. Something I can toss in my pocket with change or keys and not worry about. As for my being ""happy"" with it, I'm looking to see who has an 8GB or larger which doesn't feel as brittle."
3,Nice Piece of Equipment with a Couple of Big Drawbacks,"SanDisk's Cruzer Contour is a beautiful piece of equipment. It is finished in what appears to be stainless steel and the unit has very nice heft to it. It works beautifully and while I didn't run any speed tests, I feel confident that its performance is equal to or better than most other USB drives. The bad news is that the Contour has two serious design flaws: first, it is wide...too wide to fit in tight circumstances such as plugging into the back of PCs or many laptops. The other problem is that it has no provision for attaching any kind of cord, strap or key chain. Its smooth (and very sleek) metal case has not hole, hook or bar. These two issues caused me to return the unit."
3,Wait For Next Model,"I purchased this 8 gig memory stick this past week. Bottom line is that the housing has real potential for jamming. It is awkward to open and close....Sandisk could have designed the outer casing much better as it feels flimsy. Other than that, it is still worth the price IF you can get it for under $100...BUT just be careful (go slow) when opening and closing it so you avoid jamming. I look forward to the next model...16 gig that is hardy and simple to use. Guess I expected better from a brillant company like Sandisk."
5,You shouldn't even be reading this...you should own it.,"Buy this. If you've gone this far to pursue the Slackers singer/keyboardist's solo effort, you obviously dig the group, and you won't be let down. Just get it already. Neaty-O.Scotch"
3,Movement 1 is on disc one -the rest are on disc 2,Just thought that should be brought to your attention. You must change CDs after the first movement.
5,great jungle fighting,"What a great game. The graphics is tight. There were no boring levels, no moments of bordom what so ever in this game. It's like a giant adrenaline rush when playing it, from levels of war's raging between soldier's and mutations/Trigen's armed with rocket launcher's and Assault Riffle's"
4,fun but there's just one thing,i liked this game but the thing i did not was they say lots of swear wordsother then the swear words get it
4,Music from another planet,"This is unlike anything de Grassi has ever done. It's music from another planet, another dimension. I only give it 4 stars because it may turn a few people off... But if you are an adventurous type, particularly an adventurous guitar player, this is a 5-star album."
5,Excellent literature and images,This book is a great instrument for anyone who is interested in creating beautiful floral arrangements. It illustrates at least one example for every occasion. Images are great and it has great easy to read information
3,Just Ok!,"Great pictures and ideas, but not for the beginning florist. If your just starting out, have no experience and trying to learn the art of floral design, this is not the book for you to learn."
5,Truly a master class in floral design,"This book is amazing! Detailed, gorgeous photos and instructions to create the best floral arrangements of your life. New ideas on every page, lots of suggestions for supplies and techniques."
4,Gave me Inspiration,"I chose this book to help me get ready for a State Flower show. I found the photos and designs inspirational to me. Paula Pryke's material selection is outstanding and she's thinking outside the box. The content is not too textbook, technical or preachy, but simply laid out. There is limited information about the mechanics of creating a design which is why I give it a 4.I'm happy to say my design won a blue ribbon."
5,Great book on fresh flower arranging.,"Beautiful book on fresh flower arranging. Lots of information and lovely photographs. There is good technical information regarding the basics of arranging flowers in general. Her designs are beautiful but personally, not something I would want to reproduce. They are too edgy. She is obviously very talented. If you are looking for a book on silk flower arranging, try Decorating With Silk & Dried Flowers by The Home Decorating Institute. Even if you are more interested in silk flower arranging, there is still a lot of good information about color, line, texture, etc. in this one."
2,AC Delco D328A....CHEAP!,This cap does'nt even have metal inserts where the cap is screwed to the distributor. CHEAP! The knock-off brands are made much better than this. Won't be buying ANYTHING with AC-Delco on it again!
3,"OK QUALITY, BUT . . .",. . . was kinda expecting more from ACDelco. Conductors are aluminum rather than more premium material like brass. No metal inserts in screw holes where cap screws down to distributor to prevent cracking--just a hole in a piece of plastic. But the Amazon Warehouse Deals price was very good--about 75% lower than normal retail and cap was brand new!
5,An outstanding reference book,"This dictionary of symbols and imagery is one of the best books I have ever purchased. It's an invaluable source for humanities students as well as for anybody interested in the meaning and study of images and concepts as showed in literature, mythology, legends, folklore and the like. It offers a wide range of terminology and specific vocabulary and refers the reader to a great number of literary works where certain symbols are represented. Maybe this dictionary by De Vries is not very easy to use and apart from that it is also expensive, austere, and hard-to-find; but I assure you that, once you begin using it, it's worth every penny you spent on it. Just buy it on an impulse and don't think about the price, you won't repent. It's a wonderful dictionary, I love it and I strongly recommend it to everybody."
3,way overpriced,I happened to get a decent deal on the book and I'm so glad that I didn't pay the money that they're asking for. It is extensive in scope but the definitions are to me shallow. Intuitive?..Intellectual and a reference book. There are many decent ones out there just as good if not better than this one at 1/20th the price.
5,Good Story... A Well Done Special,Some Barney specials are better than others. This Christmas episode is great.There is a nice plot about finding the missing star for the top of the big tree in the park. The kids do a nice job with the dances and their acting is above average for a Barney episode. The adult characters do a nice job as well. The grandmother is particularly believable.They fit in a short shout out to Kwanzaa and Hanukkah.There is a lot of scenes outside in the snow and it's very realistic looking. It got me in a holiday mood and my 2 1/2 year old enjoys it.
4,Barney = Child entertainment,"Did I watch this? No. Do I have a 5 and 3 year old that love it? Yes. If you want to download this to and view it on anything other than a PC or Kindle Fire, well good luck. It's possible but time consuming."
5,Great (though short) Intro to the Music of Red Molly,"Red Molly are three female singer-songwriters and they have the most incredible interweaved voices and harmonies. I suppose their music is (if you need to characterize it at all) that nexus of country, folk, and bluegrass where you might also find the Be Good Tanyas and Wailing Jenny. The name Red Molly is apparently from a character in a Richard Thompson song called ""1952 Vincent Black Lightning."" This slim album (only four songs) is a great introduction to their sound. I have to say that Long Island Cowboy is worth the price of the album all by itself, and is one of the most addictive songs I have ever listened to; beautiful, charming, and the kind of song I listen to over and over and over. Check these three marvelous musicians out, and if you like this album then get one of their full albums, like Never Been To Vegas.Red Molly Ep"
3,Les Rois Maudits - good but no English subtitles,"I enjoyed the melodrama and spectacle of this production, especially Jeanne Moreau and Gerard Depardieu's performances. Moreau is both likeable and venomous as the conniving matriarch of a generally ruthless and ambitious clan. The only real problem is that,even with the French subtitles on, it was sometimes difficult to catch the finer details of plot, though the broad gist of the action was clear. English subtitles, well done, would have helped a great deal."
5,Awesome performances,"I agree with the last reviewer: the recording of Till, Zaratustra and Don Juan are excellent, as usual for any CSO/Solti work. The sound is magnificent and I've hardly heard a better performance of Till. Even more surprising and impressive is the Alpinesinfonie by the Bavarian Rudfunk. I think this performance is much better than the Karajan/BPO one."
3,beginners Russian,"So far so good. Taking an adult class at a local school and the instructor recommended these items. I like the cds, I can listen while driving. The book's glossary is very limited although, can use some more words to/from Russian/English..."
5,Very good beginning choice,"I am only about one fourth of the way through and I like this book plus 2 D course very much. Vocabulary is starting to add up, although it would be great to get feed back on my pronunciation. I hope this course will be followed by another that is at an intermediate or higher level.....Recommended for beginners like me!"
5,Lively Colombian (Latin) Dance Orchestra,"The Lucho Bermudez orchestra with its big-band Colombian sound makes me happy. I want to get out of my seat and learn to dance. I love the Colombian rhythms--slightly different from the typical Latin cha-cha, merengue, rhumba, etc.--and the fabulous instrumentation and playing! My Colombian friend who introduced me to this music over Christmas said that every privileged teenager in 1960s Bogota danced to the Lucho Bermudez orchestra at quinces (debutante balls). I can hear why."
5,High quality tweezers ........,bought these for tweezing hairs and eyebrows the magnifier really helps very nicely made tweezers ...very impressed with the quality ..not the cheapest tweezers ..but the quality shows..you get what you pay for ...
4,The Phantom's Phirst!,"The Phantom easily translates his NY Daily News newspaper column into a breezy, fun-filled video guide. Similar in style to Mike Weldon's THE PSYCHOTRONIC ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FILM, The Phantom throws in interviews with B-movie stars and directors, profiles of stars and overviews of film series."
3,3.5 this will scare you,"The acting is so-so but this film has some genuine scares. There are some plot holes but I suspect some of that was due to the low budget - better to just ignore that the closed prison is really clean. I'm not sure ""dirty up prison"" was in the budget. The stairs as noted by others - that's what made this a nifty little horror film. Worth a Netflix spot."
1,Remarkably uninteresting & far from scary,"""Dark Remains"" may help your insomnia-it put me to sleep. Here are no visuals, no story, no scares. And who cares what happens to these very unengaging characters? It was as if someone with a camera found a couple of empty buildings and had people (the scary stuff) pop in and out of the background while something boring was going on in the foreground.There weren't even any laughs, inadvertent or intentional.Give me Evil Dead II for scary (and funny) any day."
5,A great way to spice up your life!,"For the devoted pepper aficionado, this book is all business. The book provides scores of delectable recipes and informs the reader of what makes up the chili pepper. A history lesson or two is included at no extra cost. The recipe for habanero paste is outstanding, especially on my favorite local pizza. Relocation to Pittsburgh is required for the pizza, sorry. Warning, the purchase of this book results in a better diet and a truly wise pepper consumer. You will be the center of attention at parties and the opposite sex will flock toward you in droves. O.K., I'm exaggerating you may just experience the state of Zen"
5,"Informative in application & history, plus great recipes!","The Cajun recipes are amazing, as well as the sauces. In fact, I have used many of the recipes and have not found a single one I haven't thought was really good. I'm giving this book as a gift because I'm tired of writing down the recipes for my friends. This book rates a triple YUM!"
2,a little more info (if anyone cares),"According to Gramophone, the piano is an 1824 Graf and this recording was made in 1989 (or earlier). They didn't like it much, either, and went into far greater detail than I. This duo actually recorded the complete Beethoven violin sonatas but the rest remains to be reissued (though I can't imagine it will be)."
3,not complete,very limited in listings..with a guide just for 45s I thought it would be a lot more complete...found more listings in my regulat price guide{for all size records} than I did in this!
4,As good as it gets,"With records becoming more and more plentiful, it does lose a little of the obscure stuff it used to carry. However, it is a MUST for any collector!"
2,not worth a penny,All I will say is if you're looking for any obscure stuff from the 70's 80's it's not in there. You're better off check websites that sell 45's.
1,no need to buy this if you have som of the earlier editions !!,"Not relevant for todays market !I whis I could buy some of the soul, garage and freakbeat records listed there for the prices they estimate !! And the mainstream records are listed too high ! Buy the Jerry Osbourne price guide instead !!(and the colour section section pages fell out after one read)Avoid this !"
4,Great book for collectors of all kinds,Great book - excellent presentation as always. It can be disconcerting when trying to find a record and it is not in the book but there is information contained in it's pages to assist with that problem.
1,lasted 1 day,"A disappointing x-mas present for my son. Initial (windows-xp) installation problems were eventually resolved with a PlayCenter 2.5 upgrade and xp patch. Unfortunately, the upgrade wasn't at the website documented with the unit. Finally the unit was working great! The next day downloading stopped working. After reinstalling the SW, downloading appeared to work but it wouldn't play. Creative's web support and FAQs were not helpful. Hope others have a better experience. Mine is being returned."
4,excellent mp3,"i love my mp3 nomad IIc. my sister tried mine and had to buy one. it beats working out and having to listen to alot of talking on the radio. i love the ability to download music and re-download to change the music. the only drawback i have found is that my headphones did not last very long. i blew out one side of the headphone speaker and ended up buying a new one. i would like to upgrade my 128mb with a 32mb card but i dont know if its really worth it to do that for one hour more of music. a friend of mine has a rio brand and ive seen an rca brand, these do not compare to the nomad IIc. its has great sound, very compact,easy and convenient to use and download!"
2,pointless,"I ordered this box set for my kids. They are not familiar with these songs so obviously reading the lyrics was the entire point.I knew they would enjoy learing and singing along to these songs. Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to read. The graphics are so terrible and out of sync that even if you do know the words, the mess on the screen completely distracts you. I can't believe they sell this garbage. I would return it but I don't see much alternatives on Amazon. The music is good and eventually we won't need to read the lyrics. Definitely would not have purchased this if I knew what it was like.I purchased another Billboard karaoke CD and it has the exact same problems."
3,No track list displayed on the Emerson GM527 Karaoke Machine,"There is no track list displayed on the screen on the Emerson GM527 Karaoke Player. I haven't been able to determine if the CDG format COULD or SHOULD display the list of tracks, but it's certainly a requirement in my opinion. The MP3G CDs that came with the karaoke machine did display the list of tracks on screen."
2,"Good songs, bad production",You will probably be disappointed when the lyrics don't pop up for you singers in some of the CDs. It is a great assortment of songs but the graphics are week as well as the issue with the lyrics.
1,Lyrics are important for Karaoke,"CD #1 had the lyrics that printed across the screen like a normal karaoke CD, but CD's 2-4 had no lyrics. I guess it was a defective product. I returned it."
5,Great Karaoke CD,This CD does live up to it reviews. It is an excellent compilation of the decades passed. i love it. A must have for any karaoke r.
4,What a debut!!!,"Like some of the other critics who have reviewed this album so far, I am an Expose fan as well. A long time ago, I had heard about the release of this album and finally secured my copy. I am so grateful that Gioia incorporated the songs ""Every Single Thing"" and ""Going,Going,Gone"". These tracks were clips on her former website. In addition to these songs, my favorite is ""Addicted"". It has such a haunting effect. Indeed, Gioia's vocals are stronger than ever. I applaud Gioia on her writing efforts with her music as well. Not many artists, especially those who release dance material, have the opportunity to showcase what they write. What a courageous comeback!!!"
3,I agree with the 3 star review,"WHY are there so many 5 star reviews for this CD? I've listened to it three times and have yet to be WOWED by it. I'm not saying the songs or the singing are terrible, but let's be realistic this is not five star rating material. I really thought with Ms.Bruno's talent I was in for a treat. Not once did I hit the repeat button. I too am glad to see Gioia back after a long absence but she's not getting a five star from me simply for that reason, I am judging the material and that designation isn't there for this. I've heard far better from Reina, Amber, Kristine W. and Lasgo to name a few. It's an OK cd but far from dance record of the year."
3,Not Bad,"This cd has tons of 5 star ratings and lets be honest. Its an ok cd. Nothing here is as good as expose. Trying not to compare her to it, but if your expecting expose forget it. Its mostly a techo dance cd. Her vocals and everything sound good. But I really only like one song ""every little thing"", guess it has the most expose feel to it. Its a slow ballad and is a good song. The others songs remind me of being at the bar. Anyway the dance tracks that arent too bad is ""be mine"" & ""i was made for loving you"". she has a good voice but every song really sounds the same. should have been more ballads. But its her first cd and its ok."
3,Doesn't Sound Like the Fischer Z I Know,"If you are a fan of Fischer Z's earlier, better known work, you may find this album a bit difficult. The guitar sound is quite different and there is a lot less of the synths that characterise most of Fischer Z's work. In fact, it is only John Watts inimitable vocals that give any clue as to who it might be. The song writing is typically strong but for me, it just isn't the sort of music I like, or expected from Fischer Z. It is in the vein of Destination Paradise, so if you like that album you may enjoy this, but if you are like me - a Red Skies Over Paradise kinda guy - you may struggle with it. I do."
1,Limited only to New Jersey,"Doesn't cover all states and only covers New Jersey, should have changed the title."
5,Good Information Resource,"Michael Pellegrino provides some very good information about investing in tax liens in New Jersey. A great deal of the information and common sense advice will also be very helpful if you're considering investing in liens in other states, as long as you do your research and become thoroughly familiar with that state's and county's statutes and procedures. I definitely recommend this book as a good resource."
5,well written,this is by far the best bang for your buck. this book was very well written and easy enough for a 5th grader to understand. the details were also very helpful im looking foward to my 1st auction
3,Specific,I was looking for further information about the NJ lien process. This book gave me further details to work with since NJ differs then other state liens.
1,I tried hard ... but no way,"Well, I can say I'm a quite open-minded music enthusiast ... but there it's difficult to rate this as more than ""lethargic"". I mean, it's so dull !!! Not a single track to save the whole thing... Are their albums all cast in the same mould ??? Better idea : listen to Love like blood , Killing Joke's diamond of a song :-)"
1,Awful. A best of the worst.,"14 tracks of dull, awful gothic []. No heart, soul or lyrical content of ANY merit. A poor band that should NEVER be allowed the luxury of a recording studio again. Avoid at ALL costs."
2,Feeder issues,"The feeder on this printer does not work as I expected based on previous experience with HP printers. Printing labels has been the most frustrating. The feeder pulls the label sheet in crooked, or it pulls it too far in, or not far enough in. I have also experienced the problem of the feeder pulling 10 sheets in at once."
2,You could easily find something better,"The other reviews about the feeder issues are correct. Other than that its an ok printer if you are not doing big jobs. The ink in CONSTANTLY running out..seems like I have to put in a new ink cartridge every week. I do print everyday but I dont print HUGE amounts everyday. Also, there is no generic ink for it on the market so you are stuck buying the expensive stuff."
1,Wish I had a better printer,"I got this as a gift, been using it for about a year. It works best when it turned off. Forget about using it for envelopes, just smears the address. Its does not take up to much space, and that's good. On/off switch does not work will, most of the time it just stays on. Does not know when you have paper in the tray, and don't put to much in, will not load."
1,Bad printer - Don't buy THIS,This is one of the worst printer. Paper jams are very offen. There is no way to figure out why it does not work some time. It is worth trashing it. That is what I plan to do.
1,I hate this printer.,"I got this printer a few years ago when I needed one for college. It has been nothing but trouble. From feeder issues to just not wanting to print at all - it's not worth it. It also claims that it can do custom paper size up to 8.5x18. I would love to know how they figure that, because I've NEVER gotten any custom size to work. I'm glad I only payed $40 for mine, if I would have paid the full $124.99 like the list price here, it would have gone back long ago."
4,Could get 5 Stars,Why only 4 stars? Because it is not the best of the best in my opinion but it is still great. I own several recordings of Mahler 2 and this recording is an example of a straight ahead Mahler reading. It has been argued that there are 2 approaches to this symmphony the Klemperer style or the Walter syle. Blomstedt avoids excesses of either approach and just tears into the notes in the score. Crystal clear Decca recording makes this one a no brainer.
5,BUY IT,This band is based on the works of J. R. R. Tolkien who of course is the person who created Lord of the Rings. I would have to describe this music as Fantasy Black Metal (much like the band Battlelore which I strongly recommend also). The music is unique and enchanting so pick it up and give it a try.There other albums can be found on Napalmrecords.com
5,Great starter resource!,"Although I have some sewing experience, it's been awhile ago and I wanted lots of pictures, spiral bound, and no assumptions. This book delivers. I'm ready for Home Decor 201 now! Thanks!"
4,Sewing 101,Great book easy to understand and detailed instructions for a beginner. Really enjoy the book.
2,Does not properly fit!,After searching high and low for a watchband replacement for my husband's watch I spotted this one on Amazon. It did not properly fit so we had to trim and manipulate it to even get it close.
1,Poor sound quality,I was very disappointed with the sound quality and low recording level on this CD. It is truly hard to hear it without cranking the volume to its max.
2,An old recording,"You should know that this is a very old recording (made in the 1970s). It badly needs to be remastered to avoid a ""hissing"" noise. Go with the Kocsis Debussy--Solo Piano Music recording. It's clear, fresh, and you can distinguish every note."
5,Two Classic Albums in One,"I grew up listening to Jim Reeves' music. He was called the Voice of Velvet. Few people in history have had the vocal quality of this superstar who died way too young. Besides the beautiful melodies included in the Touch of Velvet album and Jim's many other albums, he lent his speaking voice to poetry and stories in the Talking to Your Heart album. Old Tige was always a family favorite. But for me Jim's oration of The Spell of the Yukon is worth the price of the CD and then some. Some people consider the poems on this album to be corny. I say just enjoy them. Sit back and listen. Lose yourself in the voice of velvet."
2,Whoops. Production Decision Spoils Jim Reeves' CD,"Whoever decided to publish a CD with Jim Reeves talking to music in ""Talking to the Heart"" really blew it! I found the repetition of talking coupled with a cadwallowing choir in the background pretty near too much to tolerate. The choir sounded like same choir singing (?) the same song in different speeches. I'm sorry, but as much as I like the other CDs, this is one I cound do without."
1,very poor considering all the hype,"I bought this for a gift after having a very reliable mustek dv 40000 my mum has one too for 3 years and we have never had any problems. I took a long time to find a camera that took both still and video images. I thought with all the spec on this new one I wouldn't be disappointed. How wrong I was. Pixelated images on zoom, video play back had very poor audio, voice recording audio had the same problem colour of images indoors was washed out without flash and too strong with flash I am really disapointed and now the recipient will be late with a birthday present, didn't bother trying music it's going straight back to the shop."
1,Disintegrated after only 2 1/2 mows!,"I ordered these items in May 2012 and due to drought only mowed my lawn twice in that time as there was no grass growth.Today I started to mow my lawn and the bearings disintegrated, throwing the belt and jamming the other blade assembly on my 42"" deck causing the other blade assembly to become damaged ..I expected these bearing to last at least as long as the original ones which they replaced, which was nearly 2 years of regular mowing of 5 - 6 mows per year and not 2 1/2 mows!Very very disappointed.Would rate this as ZERO stars and not 1 star!"
2,Project Runway: Bikini model episode,"Can I say that re-editing went backwards with this film? First we had the very short R rated version, then when it didn't sell good at the video stores that don't sell adult titles, an unrated ""director's cut"" was released. The R version has some rediculous nude scenes that cut back to the characters wearing their clothes again. And of course, loads of scenes with the alien girls in question just dancing around to fill up the time. Should be an episode of Project Runway, but mostly it reminds me of the Saturday afternoon music shows on Mexican TV where the bikini models just dance on the beach to each song on the hit parade."
3,Nice looking girls!! w/ great music...,Good coordination of music with the main theme of the film. It keeps you focused on the movie.

4,ULI is back.,"ULI is back. Thank you oh mighty man. The best fusion of classic and rock i ever have heard, and the album is only a little part of a Big part. Can't wait for a new album, and some new concerts.Best track on CD.-STARLIGHT- I'm melting, that guitar is playd with the hands of a GREAT/BIG/BRILLIANT master, and where can I get a copy of his SKY guitar."
3,in response to the guy that wanted info on tim smooth,"I Have That Tim Smooth CD and That MC THICK CD(his first with Marrero)contact me if you want to buy or trade..by the way this is a good Tim Smooth CD and this kat is from New Orleans , La. area."
5,Working well,I've loaded in a few of the new toners. So far so good. The color looks good and consistent. Much less expensive too.
5,Great Snack,Very nice healthy snack. I have them in my desk at work- great for on the go people who want healthy/organic snack options.My co-workers have been enjoying them as well.
4,Pretty good!,Pretty good book! The beginning started off very slow but once the secret was released it was a lot better.
2,Not sticky tape,"As mentioned in another review, this is not a toy. I used the magnetic tape on strips of laminated paper. The magnets held fine, but the tape did not hold the laminated paper. I find several strips of paper on the floor everyday with the magnet still stuck to the board. I am applying double-sided scotch tape to the tape to see if that helps. Next, step will be glue. Bottom line - not sticky enough to hold items to magnet."
2,adhesive is not strong enough,"We tried to hang cardstock using this tape and the magnetic was plenty strong, but the adhesive was not near strong enough. The cards would fall off the metal wall, not the magnets."
1,Not what I needed,"Not sure why this is catagorized as a toy. This did not do the job that I wanted it to do. The magnetism was not strong enough for the job. I did return this product and was very satisfied with the return process, I am sure that this product is usefull for very light magnetic use."
3,"Not ""sticky"" enought!",Had to glue it to the back of what I needed it to stick too. The ProMAG was much better!
1,Not even worth 1 star,"If the shoddy look of this DVD doesn't convince you of the poor quality of this video, maybe all the negative reviews will. This is an unofficial video that features a few fan interviews, a few minutes of biographies on the Dixie Chicks, and a bunch of useless fluff to fill the other 40 minutes (which isn't to say that the entire video isn't fluff). It looks like an 8th grade film project that someone started the night before it was due.There is NO MUSIC ON THIS VIDEO!"
1,DON'T,"Don't buy this, don't watch it. I'm sorry the rating system made me give it even one star. It absolutely stinks and, in the words of the Sixties, it's one big ripoff, man. Seriously, I'm a big fan of da Chicks and this has none of their music, none of their performances. It mostly consists of interviews with a few flea-bitten disc jockeys no one's heard of (other than their mothers and the producer of this video). I couldn't get this in the trash quick enough."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I agree with Neal. I, too, am a true Dixie Chicks fan and this video is not worth buying. The narrator is boring and the video is very out of date. It doesn't have any good footage and the people they interview have nothing to do with the chicks. Don't buy it!"
2,A Poor Potrayal of Their Talent,I agree with Chris' review. I am a HUGE fan and was delighted to see a Dixie Chick's video--but was extremely disappointed with this video. Don't buy it - wait for a concert video to come out!
1,For groupies only,"My mistake in buying this was in not reading the entire video description. If you enjoy ""blah, blah, blah"", you'll love this video."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is not even endorsed by the Chicks. No music on it. Very borning. Waste of money. If you need the Chicks on DVD, buy the evening with the Dixie Chicks worth the $$$."
5,OEM replacement for 2007 Ford F150 FX4 5.4 Flex,"I choose these over motorcraft plugs for my F150 due to the price difference, I've noticed no negative effects and the truck has been running great for 6+ months now."
4,Funky Design & Pricey!,"Have a '07 V8 Mustang GT with less than 5K on the clock. I pulled them at 3K and cleaned them and applied anti-seize. The car is a 5 speed that although I don't beat it, it does get ""DRIVEN"". No granny drivers here! My first choice was Bosch but they don't make them. I got these on special at a local retailer for $12 each which is a bit steep. Make sure you read the tech bulletin autolite has, it may be helpfull. The car runs great! Hopefully these will perform better that the factory plugs which in my opinion are SH**!"
3,heats up more than expected and gets greasy,"effective at protecting my cookie sheet from stains and is easier to lift cookies off of, but it get very hot which was unexpected and is difficult to clean as grease from the cookies and pastry tends to leave residue"
5,Works great!,This is even thicker than the ones I bought from another manufacturer so my daughter's cat shouldn't be able to chew into this one as easily!
2,Not what I had hoped for!,Lightly oiled it as directed. Now all it does is smoke in the over. I am very disappointed in this product.
3,Looks good,It looks good but it is not easy to work with. You need to put it on another tray to keep it from bending and it retains the color of whatever it is you are cooking.
3,OKAY SHEETS,These sheets i gave 3 stars because i thought they were actual pans not just sheet for in pans. Hope they come back with the actual pans again.PLEASE.
4,Not really what I was looking for,They are a nice product if it is what you are looking for. I was wanting a cookie sheet with sides but this is just a flat flimsey peice that you can put in your current cookie sheets. I have not tried it yet so i can not give a review of that.
1,They sent a muffin pan!,"I ordered a baking sheet, they sent me a muffin pan! The product was in a sealed plastic bag with a UPC sticker that said ""Baking Sheet"", but was actually a muffin pan. Now, I'm a guy who cannot cook and purchased the baking sheet for my wife, but even *I* can tell the difference between a muffin pan and baking sheet. The muffin pan was returned."
1,Silicone Solutions Baking sheet,"It did not last, 5 months only. Become brittle and broke. Will no buy the item again."
3,wrong dimensions!,"The dimensions in the ""product features"" are correct, but the ""product details"" are wrong! This product is 12"" by 16"" and the thickness is 1/16"" (close to 0.06"" as stated). The ""product details"" incorrectly give the size as 16x18x0.1."
5,SILICON MAT,"mutlti purpose mat; well made; I use daily to stabalize mixing bowls, and other items; I understand this may be used on a baking sheet so cookies and the like will not stick."
3,Silicone Solutions Mat,"The mat arrived on time and as expected. It does work wonders in the oven. It is going to save me a lot of trouble with things sticking and better than using foil and throwing it away all the time. The only thing I do not like is the size. It was very hard to find a pan for it to fit in. I didn't think it would be that difficult. I found a Wilton 12 x 16 pan and it fits but not completly flat since they are the same size. I wish I knew that before I ordered this one, I could have found a different size or one that maybe could be cut. This one may be able to be cut to fit but since it does not specify I am not going to mess with it."
3,Baking sheet,I was really looking for the cookie sheet. I haven't used this item yet. I will try it very soon
2,"Good for a placemat, but it's no Silpat baking sheet","We got this to use as a placemat for our toddler -- not to use as a baking sheet. But, even without baking food on it at high temperatures, food sticks to it more than another other material I've ever dealt with. So, we're talking just cereal and veggies here, dried on. It takes some serious scrubbing to get it clean from such minor food particles. In contrast, we have a couple Silpat baking sheets and nothing could ever, ever stick to those suckers. I think you could drip crazy glue on them and it'd rinse off. If you're considering baking on a synthetic sheet liner, go for the Silpat. There's some amazing technology in them -- incredibly even heating properties and, again, the easiest cleaning job you'll ever have. This Silicone Solutions sheet is just...a boring ol' rectangle of silicone and a food magnet."
1,Silicone melted in my oven,"First off, I will have to admit that I was stupid enough to buy a flimsy baking sheet that only gets flimsier when heated thus making it impossible to use without a metal baking tray. I burn my fingers every time I use this.Second, the one time I used it without a metal baking tray, it melted in my oven (bottom shelf - bad idea). A hole straight through the sheet and fumes everywhere. I had to throw out everything in the oven and am still slightly paranoid that I may get sick.Third, the times I did successfully bake with the silicone sheets, cookies took longer to bake.I want my money back."
5,Totally Awesome!!!,"This game is a terrific game!! It isn't bloody gorey, so your parents won't kill you if they found out what kind of game it is!! If you love games where there are no limits in a level and you are free to roam wherever this is the game for you!! But if you are looking for a shooting game you may want to look somewhere else. But overall if the scale was to ten thats how i would have rated it!!"
4,it takes time but fun,this game is great once u get the hang of it the only reason it didnt get a 5 is because its really hard to get use to the aircraft but i got it down and i look like an ace ifu were goign to get this game to a child say 12 and under i wouldnt recommend it its very hard to learn
2,"Could have been much better, a real disappointment","I really had my heart set on Toy Commander and when I got it, the game just didn't deliver! The game concept is really cool on paper but it didn't translate into a good game. The jerky camera which comes as a result of the poor vehicle control actually makes me sick everytime I play it! Control is so important in any 3D game and this game just lacking, big time!The multi player mode is also disappointing as the small vehicles get lost among the colourful stages. The game is just not fun! The graphics and the sounds are great but the game is just lacking in the fun department.I'm sorry people but the bottom line is that you can pass on this game and be quite contented because you saved a couple of bucks."
4,This game is loads of fun. Ingenious idea for a game!,"This game is just tons of fun. We have all wanted to play with our toys again as adults, and this game allows that fantasy to come true. The graphics are exhilirating and the game play, especially the multiplayer, is extremely fun."
5,Great Family Fun,"This is an incredibly fun game for all ages. There is a lot of practice and luck required for the flying machines but the ground vehicles are great. We play as a family and have a wonderful time. Even though you are shooting, it is not a destructive game. The violence is not obvious and there are games where it is nonexistent. I highly recommend this game for families."
5,awesome,"just purchased my dreamcast - and I have Soul Caliber and Toy Commander.. While Soul Caliber is clearly the best 3d fighting game, hands down, Toy Commander is one of the best mission play games I've seen in a long time. Goes a long way to detail the environment, and shows that you don't need big guns and bombs to make a great game - just your average house with a couple of toys! For those new to the dreamcast - this game is highly recommended. I've been impressed by the dreamcast - both games I've purchased have been a hit in my book."
5,Not Just for little kids,"When I first saw this game it looked like a children game, but after reading some reviews I noticed that didn't look that bad, so I gave it a try. You basically go through a bunch of missions as various different new toys and try to defeat assorted older toys.Now, you may not find this fun, But I did and I'm 16. The whole Game took me about 1 week to beat.But, it also has a pretty cool multi-player mode. You get to play as everything from Jeeps to Jets to Bulldozers to Alien Spacecrafts. I would suggest this game to any one looking for some short term fun."
5,finally a great game based on toys!,"everything about this game i love.the graphics are great,soundqaulity good also,great mission objectives,there is alot of imagination here.this game will give you youre moneys worth! only gripes are some missions are extremely tough and unforgiving this is probably the allaround best game on the dreamcast i cant wait for toy commander 2"
4,"Good book, with not such a great cover","Why is Melanie riding Star with a HALTER with REINS? And why does the saddle have no GIRTH? That's weird.Anyways, this was a good book. In the book Christina has a racetrack accident on a horse named Charisma. The doctor tells Christina that she can't ride Star for a while. Which means that Melanie will have to ride Star in the Breeder's Cup. But Star won't behave for Melanie.And Christina keeps on telling Melanie how to work with Star when she should let Melanie work with Star her own way. But in the end Star finally listens to Melanie and does well in the Breeder's Cup.I give the book 4 Stars because the book was well written and it was exciting. The 1 Star I didn't give it was because the cover."
4,A good read!,"This book definitely represents one of the best in the ""New Generation."" To echo the sentiments of a previous reviewer, I found Chris's consideration of other careers in the horse world refreshing -- and intriguing. It seems the series in definitely on the upswing; I would definitely keep purchasing books as they keep coming out!I've been a Thoroughbred reader for 10 years, ever since I bought Pride's Challenge (#9) at an elementary school book fair. Needless to say, I was incredibly disappointed to hear that the publisher has decided to end the series. Generations of horse lovers (and me!) are going to be missing out."
4,yay!,"i really loved this book. christina's character improved so tremendously. i'm glad she's looking into other equine careers (she's always kind of been an independent spirit, hasn't she?), and i really like allie's character and the reemergence of her forgotten parents, even though they are dead now. i also liked the lack of errors that have plagued past books.i'm glad to see that this series is improving, and i'm greatly saddened that it will be ending as it comes into a new era of good reading."
4,Above Average Book,"I have always liked this author; I can always count on him for a good story. This book came through for me although it was not one of his best, I think this was the period of time when we used another name and was really pumping the books out. There are other books that capture this period in time better and the plot was moving to the ""no way"" factor for me. He did a good job with an interesting story"
3,...they keep on rocking,"I was a bit cautious when I picked up this new release of German goth giants Umbra et Imago due to some negativity I heard from my friend in Germany. But upon listening to Mozart's newest creation, I was very delighted to hear that not much has changed from previous recordings.Darkwave, Industrial, EBM...call it what you will, but Umbra et Imago have added to their classic songs by featuring ""MILCH"" and ""ES BRENNT DIE SEHNSUCHT"" on this very good CD. ""Milch"" is an excellent song which flows smoothly over the speakers and gives a great goth vibe. ""Es Brennt Die Sehnsucht"" is very dessert influenced and is arguably one of Umbra's coolest songs.Not their best album, but definitely a great addition (although collectors and fans will pick it up anyway)."
5,Funny and intelligent guide to being Israeli,"Culture Shock! Israel is not so much a travel guide to Israel if you're looking for physical landmarks and tourist sites. It's a guide to the soul of Israel--its people, culture, and history. The guide explains everything from serving in the Israeli Defense Forces to immigrant society to casual wear. It explains how Israelis perceive the world and themselves, with much humor as well as interesting facts. At the end, there is a cultural multiple choice quiz in which you, the reader, are given a bunch of scenarios and asked to choose the best answer based on what you've learned in the book. And as a special treat, the book even throws in how to walk and talk like a sabra"
5,I'm ready to move to Israel.,"This is the coolest travel book I've ever read! After reading it, I wanted to start packing my furniture and things (3 months early). Mr Winter shows you the vast differences between the Israeli and Western way of life, yet in such a manner that you already feel like you belong there."
2,"Way, WAY Out of Date","First off, this book feels like just another churned-out book in a series, and it turns out that's exactly what it is. That wouldn't be so bad, but the Culture Shock! books are intentionally banal so as to stay away from any hint of controversy.Although 12 years may not seem like a lot of time (published 1992), it is almost 1/4 of modern Israel's history, so almost by definition this book is outdated. Imagine trying to read a book about the USA from the 1940s and having it be relevant today. That's kind of how it feels."
1,Junk,"This book is not worth its price like most of the books where Lamar Fike is involved. It contains information already published over and over a hundred times but more accurately in other publications. If you are interested in Elvis Presleys life and music, ""Elvis Day by Day"" by Jorgensen and Guralnick is the better choice."
5,Leading the way to the Revolution,"This book uses Dr. Thomas's talent for storytelling to advance his ideas. The Eden Alternative is a way for Long Term Care facilities to be a real home to the people that live there, a place families will enjoy visiting. The changes are very low tech and save money in the long run. The environment these changes create is not only wonderful for the people who LIVE there, but for the staff as well. I encourage anyone with family in a facility to read this book."
1,A book written by a communist A.Szechter vel Michnik.,"Adam Szechter vel Michnik - an ateist and communist with international ties, former member of Communist Party (PZPR), son of Helena and Ozjasz Szechter (both communists). Anti-Polish as his father Ozjasz who was a Soviet spy and collaborator and enemy of Poles. *source of information: Polish history book ""Rzady Zbirow 1940-1990"" by H.Pajak, S.Zochowski, 1996 edition"
3,Oddly Compelling & Depressing..,"Don't let the cover of this book fool you;this is not a funny book,maybe in a tragio-comedic way. It is really about how the so-called ""American Dream"" eludes several female generations of a Russian-Jewish emmigrant family. Its not a typical ""rags to riches""story like most books dealing with Jewish immigrants. In a way,I like how the writer avoided that obvious trap. It was rather sad though and could have used more humor,as it started to bring me down the more I read it. That aside, This young woman is a writer to watch,Her metaphors and observations are both unusual and memorable."
3,"good book, but","I was somewhat disappointed in it, after the stellar heights Flying Leap reached. The magical fairy tale elements were fun and sometimes riveting, especially in the beginning, but the overall telling, the voices employed - for me grew curiously flat over the length of the novel, and seemed somewhat indistinguisable from one another. That weakness in voice was the main drawback - the deadpan delivery often comes up short on reflection and internalization, and finally rendered the story predictable, despite clever plot twists. Reading the stories of Flying Leap, I was constantly startled and amazed by the richness of invention, and here, I was engaged and surprised, but only sporadically, and never to the degree that the short stories acheived. I still enjoyed the book, I just wasn't transported."
3,Wonderful debut,"I became familiar with Budnitz's short stories through The New Yorker; I fell in love with her delicate, quirky tales told with economy and precision of language. Her expertise and flair seem to lie in shorter narratives versus what she attempted with ""If I Told You Once"". It's a charming story of growing up in war-era Eastern Europe, coming to America, and the generations linking those experiences. Two other recent novels, ""Middlesex"" and ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,"" share those plotlines, and, if it weren't for Budnitz's unique writing style, I wouldn't have been as satisfied."
4,Enjoyable fairy tale,"Mercedes Lackey picks a great premise for this tale of a fairy godmother. My chief complaint is that not enough time is devoted to the details of the premise. The concept is so intriguing that i feel it warrants more attention and could hold a reader's interest.The romance segment of the novel is not an unwelcome feature and certainly plays directly into the theme, but is given too much attention. It seems the whole first half of the book is written to explain the mechanics of the romance.All in all, this is definitely a good read but not one that I couldn't put down."
1,False Binding and missing Pages in the Luna Paperback Edition,"This is not a review on the story of the book, you will find already some, that will help you to make your choice of buying it or not.But be aware, that in the Paperback Edition published by Luna Books, First Edition from January 2004 the Pages 33 - 64 are missing and instead the Pages 433-464 are inserted at the beginning of the book, but they are also right in place near the end of the story, where they should be.So 433-464 are twice and 33-64 nowhere in this edition.So if you want to buy this book, please consider the hardcover or another paperback edition.[[ASIN:0373802455 The Fairy Godmother (Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms, Book 1, Paperback Luna Books com. January 2004"
4,Captivating and enchanting!,"This was my first experiance with Lackey, and I was thrilled! The mesh of different fairy tales and the new to me idea of Tradition was very fresh. I loved the progression of the tale and cannot wait to read more stories set in this land."
5,Great new world,"I loved this book. I bought it mostly because I loved her valdemar series but after I started reading it I realized that it pretty much stood on it's only two feet.First of all I'm a sucker for the godmother job. I think it's fabulous. Mercedes Lackey did a wonderful job of giving it depth and making it mostly realistic.I love romance and I'm glad that it was a part of this book it was written in such a way that it wasn't the whole point of the story. Each character had a purpose outside of their romance.Overall I believe this to be a wonderful book, colorful and charming. If you love fairy tales and fantasy you should definitely read this book. I hope the ML continues to write in this world, I would love to meet more of the kingdoms and the fairy godmothers that protect them."
4,The Fairy Godmother,"Lackey has another hit series going. This fun story has a lot going for it. It does have some slow moments, but I loved the slant she put on old stories. Of course, I've always loved fairy tales and can't wait to read the rest of the series."
2,Disappointing,"I suppose if you are a romance reader with a yen for fantasy this was not too bad, but as a fantasy reader with a romantic heart, I thought it was pretty darn awful. Cinderella has be retold so many times that perhaps it would have been better just to totally subvery the plot, or to write something <gasp> original, but this was cheesey and the language was juvenile, as if romance readers are not bright enough to warrant the same fairly high quality material that other readers expect and deserve.I recommend a few other authors who write romantic fantasy that is not insulting, but beautiful--Elizabeth Haydon, Juliet Marillier and Robin McKinley. All of these authors draw beautiful tales [and Spindle's End is the ultimate retelling of Cinderella] with much greater class and skill than Lackey."
5,Fairytails in the hands of Lackey,Mercedes Lackey has a wonderful grasp of the traditional fairy tails we all loved as children and the unique abilty to twist and weave them themes into new and exciting tails. She has taken the tried and true story of Cenderella to a a truly new realm.
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this book to be a light read for vacation. As I read, I kept hoping for improvement but found none. Though I hardly had expectation for it, the book left me sadly disappointed. Some pieces of the book were muddy, and the characters were flat. I cared nothing for them, and just ended up hoping the end of the book would come as close to the beginning as possible. I have never started a book that I did not finish, and even in finishing this one found my only joy in it was that it was over."
3,"Good Story, but Gross","This story has a good plot and the whole, don't get me wrong or anything, but to any reader under 20, it's a bit of an eye-popper at the end. It is VERY sexually explicit with both conventional and oral sex in it, and albiet it has a good story, I wouldn't recommend it to any younger audiences for all of its deceptively innocent title."
1,She's done better,"This book totally stank. Sugary and syrupy, I was glad that I got it out at the library before buying. The sex scenes were really bad, and I've read my share of those kinds of books. Mostly stolen from my mom (teehee). I thought Fire Rose and her Elemental Masters series was much better, for people wanting a ""romantic"" Lackey book. I would give 0 stars if I could. I'm staying away from this series, and sticking to her others."
4,A different Cinderella,"Elena Klovis, aka Ella Cinders, finds herself like Cinderella with a wicked stepmother and two stepsisters treating her like a slave. In this case there is no prince available that is of a suitable age to rescue her. As in the case of the young girl in Andre Norton's ""Scent of Magic,"" she is taken in by an older woman and finds that she has magic power to do other things. In this case, Elena becomes the apprentice of a fairy godmother (although a human one rather than a real fairy).The book starts out well, but then becomes somewhat bland with the long explanations of the Traditions. The plot picks up a bit when she acquires a Champion. There is the usual dark side and white side of situations, and an evil black sorcerer to deal with. The novel seems to be written at the teenage to young adult level.As in other stories by the author, she creates supporting characters along the way who she then abandons. One is left to wonder whatever happened to the boy at the Mop Fair."
5,Grandmotherly advise,"This book is well written, (not that I didn't expect such from Mercedes Lackey), and though out. It held a few surprises at the end as is Lackey's usual tricks. Thanks Mercedes Lackey for a very good read."
2,I give it a 1.5 (the 1.5 is of the cover art and that's it),This book has a beautiful cover and that's about it.So...yeah I'm just very happy I borrowed this book from the library and didn't buy it.
2,Nothing Romantic About Slavery,The heroine turns a rude prince into a donkey and then makes him work as her slave. Her servants slap him and threaten to castrate him.Not my idea of romance.I gave to stars because there is a plot.
3,FUN ROMP THROUGH FAIRY TALE LAND,"Picture a world where fairy tails are historical fact and magic, through the force of Tradition, guides a person?s pathway throughout life. Now take one failed Cinderella, they can?t all get a prince you know, with no desire to live out her life slaving away to evil stepsisters and make her a Godmother, kind of a magical troubleshooter. Then take a real prince, an arrogant selfish SOB admittedly, but still a real prince. Put the two together and ?What you end up with is a lighthearted, funny romp through a delightfully new and interesting universe. It may be no award winner, it is very predictable, starts slow and a little short on action, but it?s still fun and interesting. The romance between the characters is very well done and interesting to follow. The storyline is obvious but fun; sometimes mystery isn?t all it?s cracked up to be.I rate is as average but I admit I enjoyed it and certainly RECOMMEND it to those who like a little lighthearted fantasy."
2,Sexually Explicit,"Although the story was fun and much better than most of the books I've read by Mercedes Lackey, I was extremely disappointed that there were sexually explicit scenes in the book. Ugh. Get a room. There's a reason I read fantasy and not romance. It's too bad that the ""romantic"" relationship was solely based on the lustful feelings the two main characters had for one another and not based on any actual dialog or other interaction between them. It cheapened the entire experience for me and turned a book that would normally appeal to young adults as well as adults into pornagraphic drivel."
4,A fun fairy tale,"Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical about my book choice from the front cover but I found myself looking forward to my next chance to read it once I got a few pages in. This was my first Mercedes Lackey book and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not your typical ""tale as old as time"" fairy tale. In fact, it marries traditional fairy tales with new, fresh ideas. I really liked the concept and characters. I found it a very easy book to read and quite enjoyed it. I look forward to more adventures within this realm."
5,Fairy Godmother with a Reality Twist... sort of,"This book, while still a wonderful piece of escapist fiction, and a romance to warm your heart, has some really fantastic ideas about where fairy godmothers come from and what they do. If you need to step back from reality for refreshment, this is the book for you! It's Cinderella with an edge, and more believable (sort of!) in this day and age. I wish there were more ""mini-vacation"" from life books like this out there!"
3,fairy tales with a twist,"This one got such rave reviews I just had to see what all the hipe was about. Sorry but I was not as entralled as most of the reviewers. I know this was suppose to be the first parnormal romance from LUNA, but the romance didn't happened until the last 100 pages. Most of this book was the daily life of how to become a fairy godmother and what The Tradition was all about. This was great information for futher reading in this series, but I just don't feel like it was necessary. I know Lackey was trying to be witty, and some pieces were, but not enough to hold my attention in the beginning. The end, was great. The by play between the prince and the brownies and Elena was funny and made the book."
4,good read,I read alot of different type of books from vamp romance to hardcore science. I found this book to be very well written and story very thoughtful. I enjoyed the way the author looked at the classic fairytales.
3,Great Band. Mediocre Album,"The main issue I have with this album is that it lacks the creativity that makes Nokturnal Mortum one of the most, if not the most, unique black metal bands in the genre. As opposed to their other albums, which are a rich combination between traditional black metal, Ukrainian folk music, and atmospheric undertones, this album is more akin to to the works of Dimmu Borgir, Old Man's Child, Graveworm, and Cradle of Filth. This is not a bad thing; in fact, I highly enjoy those bands I mentioned. However, I find the sound of this album unappealing. To put it in layman's terms, something does not ""click"".My advice is to stick NM's other works. My personal recommendation is ""Weltanschauung"", especially the Russian version. It is, in my opinion, the greatest album in metal history."
4,Worth the read,This book is definitely worth the read for any student entering the human services management field.
4,Human Service Book,The book was recieved in the time needed. The condition for a used book is really good. Thank you amazon
4,Human Services Book,The book came in the condition that was specified and the customer service of the seller was exemplary!!! I enjoyed working with her!!!
5,"Jazzy, Loungy, Latiny, Electronica","I originally picked up this album as part of a two for one deal at the University bookshop on campus (with Zero 7's SIMPLE THINGS), and I've very pleased ever since. It's got just the right balance of similarity and distinction between tracks, and the composition itself is great. The bonus is that it's an Auckland artist.Great relaxing tunes for a ""stay-in"" kind of socialising, but also for just about anything else. Starting with ""Hawaiian Silky"" (1 of 9 tracks) the album goes over all sorts of ground, shifting from a semi-upbeat mode to a more peaceful-relaxing tone on ""Twilight Baby"". Particular favourties of mine are ""Mr. Shakes"" and ""Me in your Shadow""."
5,An incredible book that shows the power of Inner Healing.,This book captivated me and changed me. The detail about inner healing in this book was dramatic and amazing. It helped me understand that there is a physician within. It was wonderful getting to know Gladys better through this book. Reading it made me want to be a physician. I will soon convince my peers who intend to be physician that they need to read this book. I can imagine this book changing the lives of millions. Thank you Nanni.
2,OK if you can buy fat-free prepared food from the store!,"Living in Switzerland I found the book hopeless. The recipes ask you to go to the store and buy fat-free products and ready prepared food. I was hoping that the recipes would work with raw materials and provide me with healthy meals, but I was sadly let down."
4,"Great voice, good music","I love gentle harmonic music, even if I can only barely understand other languages :). Kana has a soft pleasing tone to her voice, and her music is uplifting; she gives a homey and comfortable feel to listeners in all her songs and well worth buying. And she can actually carry a tune, isn't flashy.the only thing I am disappointed as a fan of hers is how few tracks there are to each of her CDs. It is a bit pricey for only 4 songs on each album, if you can find a download of her tracks, that is probably the way to go.I wish Amazon will allow customers to listen to foreign CDs, I am not too certain why this isn't an option."
3,ok,"This book really hasn't captured my 8 year old's attention the way that I hoped. Her main problem with it is that some of the pictures are ""kinda creepy"", and she worried that birds were killed just to make the picture. Next time I'll just get her a bird identification book."
4,Beautiful~,We are both birders. One with a serious life list and one just along for the fun of it. But we both have enjoyed the knowledge from this book and the beautiful way it is presented. Makes you feel like you are part of the world of birds.
5,BREATHTAKING,"This is the TOP OF THE LINE Bird Book! It's the perfect 'coffee table', always at your fingertips (but make sure your fingers are strong...being that the book is oversized and very HEAVY)& FULL of the most gorgeous photographs~Lovely to view, to appreciate & to become enthralled with birds, their habits, migration, etc. Even if you are NOT a bird lover, the book has such incredible layouts, that turning each page, seeing the next full page layout is just as breathtaking as the last! A 'museum' type of show. I'd recommend this to ANYONE that loves nature, photography, and appreciates how incredible nature can be."
1,The Hucksters,"The language turned me off and the out and out lies and manipulations did also. Unfortunately, my opinion is also pegged to impressions of these two on the television programs they have appeared on. I didn't bother to read more than half and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Left a bad impression,"It has been quite some time since I read this book and my review may not be fair since I have lost respect for Carville due to his poor speech at the Speaker Series. Yet, my impression now is that the book was simplistic with few insights. Except for a reinforcement of common sense there is little need to read this book."
5,Great book!,"I strongly recommend this book for all people in mgmt (and sales!).It has some very strong underlying ideas. These two guys are the king spin doctors who have fought in the trenches and won. It's certainly worth the read.I would also recommend you combine this purchase with Chris Mathews ""Hardball"" book."
5,N o Spin Zone,"If you like to be in the ""no spin zone"" this book is for you.I cringe when I see Begala and Carville on the TV, but I LOVED their new book, ""Buck Up, Suck Up..."". The tips they offer as far as applying political principals to your daily life are as important for a service technician as they are for a U. S. Senator. This book has made a big difference in the way I do my job and the way I look at my career. I only wish I had read it sooner."
5,As a consultant and Sale Engineer I use this book all the time.,"I read this book for the first time after a devastating professional loss, that made me question my career path. After reading this book, I pulled myself up made some changes to my overall career strategy and began to enjoy a tremendous amount of success. I am not a huge Carville fan, but this book is not about politics, it is about winning.I use the strategies and techniques I learned in this book everyday in sales and in Enterprise IT consulting.In fact, I think I will read this again"
2,The Act's Getting Old,"Carville and Begala are entertaining, bold, and outspoken.So what else is new?While these two never fail to amuse, and do have solid and valuable advice from the trenches of the political world, there is very little here that cannot be found in Carville's earlier books, with greater relevance and greater passion.This latest offering seems forced, as if the two -- not attached to any campaigns at the moment (does Carville even have a job anymore?) -- were trying to cash in on what's left of their Clinton-era celebrity. The effort to use campaign experience as business expertise is awkward and doesn't quite work."
2,Not what you'd expect...,"A book that could have given great insight into what its like to be a very successful, plugged-in person(s)...turns into mud. Do yourself a favor and pass this one by."
2,Mr. Carville Lost Me,"The practical nuts and bolts of how to win an election Carville-style are brilliant...his track record proves their efficacy. Unfortunately he uses this book mostly to trash his recent political adversaries. As with his past books the writing style is unneccessarily vulgar and detracts from Carvilles message.Like many books by Clinton Whitehouse alums, this book is filled with rationalization and defense of the Great Mysogynist.Yawn.There is lots of good liberal literature out there...this is not."
1,Someone Please Hire These Guys,"This was a bloody awful waste of money. And yes I have to admit to actually reading the whole thing! Arggg!! Think of a really bad Leno monologue, now imagine that he's fitted his jokes to a bunch of Democrats living in 1992, and imagine that he has no skill what-so-ever at setting up jokes. . . okay that's this ""book"". You'd think they'd have something better to do with their time but I guess when you fall on hard times (losing every election you get involved with for half a decade) there's always a way to live off long past success."
2,simplistic advice and partisan [junk],"... Save your money, here's the recap: communicate well; stay on message; Bill Clinton is God and James is his prophet.There you have it. The book is grossly partisan; while listing their favorite sound bites of all time Carville and Begala just look petty as they rip George W. for a learning disability!Hmmmm, I think the authors forgot a memorable little one-liner uttered by the man for whom they daily strap on kneepads. Something about not having an affair?Save your money world; no secrets here -- Just a rehash of ideas you'll find in any PR 101 text."
4,An Excellent Business-Strategy Book,"This book is not just about politics. It is chock full of winning strategies, personal stories, political stories, and ""five simple rules of great communicating."" If you are in sales, management, college, or just want to know secrets in communicating, you need to read this book. It provides great insight from two political strategists who know what it takes to win. Be prepared to take notes, it is well worth your time!"
4,"Nothing New Revealed, But Still Enjoyable and Practical","James Carville and Paul Beglia have written a book that is short on originality, but definitely long on practicality. While the lessons they preach are not new, they are presented in a straightforward manner that clearly elucidates the authors' points. Mix in some wry humor, appropriate anecdotes, and some good old fashioned gossip, and the reader has an entertaining book whose lessons are applicable to fields beyond politics. While one may not agree with the political slant of the authors, one has to conclude that Buck Up, Suck Up, And Come Back When You Foul Up contains enough good advice to make it worth reading."
4,Company in Consolement,"Having recently lost my husband, It was nice to curl up with someone who understood, altho, I have to admit she handles the loss a lot better than I did."
3,Prefer the old model,"It's made of nylon with a stainless bolt through the center and stainless springs that hold the wedges in place. Right now no replacement parts are being offered. The cons; it bends if you're working on a particularly heavy bike or if it's not seated properly, the ends of two of the wedges snapped off and the spring mangled up, held together now with a rubber band and super glue, it lowers the bike by about 4-6 inches which can be a pain if you have a fixed stand, it can't be used on cut frames and sometimes it gets stuck in the tube and I find myself reaching for the hammer... Pros; it will fit very small tubes such as sidewalk bikes, once it is set it holds very well, saw, hammer, drill, build it's not dropping, the clamping surface is octagon so you don't have to worry about it twisting to the side while working. I still prefer the old stainless model but no longer available."
1,park tool seat tube clamp/ ISC-4,"I just got this tool last week, it is a great concept.But has a couple of flaws... (1) it's plastic. (2) the expandinding parts are plastic.I placed this tool in an open ended seat stay, and tighten it down and !!!snap!!!it's broken. I guess I'll go back to using blank seat post to hold the bike on the stand.I would say save your money, it's not worth over $20 bucks for modest repairs.I assemble bikes for a living and can't give this thing a good reveiw"
4,Let the collaboration begin!,"What a GREAT resource this book is! It's certainly not a just a 'manual', but a step by step guide for those wishing to embark on collaboration with their screenwriting. The humor keeps the read light and quick."
5,Can't put it down,"Often script writing how-to books are intimidating and off putting. They make the reader feel as though writing is impossible and scary whereas Johnson and Stevens make me feel encouraged. This book is written in such a welcoming and conversational tone that as one reviewer put it, I too feel as though I am chatting with the writers, wine in hand, with a warm fire as background music. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is venturing into the world as a writer. If you have a writing partner, you'll be further convinced that the duet is the way to go. If you're writing solo, you'll soon be shopping for a partner."
1,Simply Pass on This One,"I could not find a way to impose a faux bold or faux italic to the fonts. And the export feature - It totally stinks. If you make any deviations from the stock logo, your resultant exported image is totally askew, off-center and looks like crap. Maybe the stock logos with default settings also export like crap - I wouldn't know. I uninstalled and deleted. I mean, really, what's the use in working on a logo for 30 minutes only to have it completely out-of-whack when you render?"
2,not impressed,"I was expecting to be able to make your own shapes and designs but you are only limited to what is provided. you can only resize the objects such as a circle, square, triangle...etc. there are better logo creating software out there that gve you more freedom. The fonts cannot be reshaped either."
1,Worthless,Save your money. Unless you are 12 and starting a lemonade stand business you are wasting your money. Not to mention that the interface is simply horrible and to say it is user-unfriendly is being kind. Do not buy.
3,new business owner,"I am a new business owner and was trying to save some money and create my own logo. This software is relatively easy to use (it did take a little getting used to because each editing element opens up in a different window). I have only been working with the software for a couple of weeks and I had some decent designs, but when I printed them the resolution was horrible. Not sure if it is a user error of it is a problem with the software. The templates are ok, but not high end professional. The bonus is that you can import your own photos and make a better looking logo. If the resolution issue is only a error on my part I would raise the rating to 4 stars."
2,Tedious drivel,"While I found some of the ideas for the storyline intriguing....the execution was tedious and rife with hackneyed phrasing. I found it impossible to connect to any of the characters or relate to the setting as described. I finished the book, but instead of savoring the experience, I often resorted to listening to the audio book at the faster pace--just so it would end sooner."
5,Rousing music from Ireland.,Any fan of Irish music should love the rousing harmonious music of the Wolfe Tones. You may be tempted to sing or dance along. Loved it!
3,"Handle broke, now what?","Installed a 2"" slip-slip in a pool application in Nov 2004. Yesterday at closing the handle ears completely broke off and I cut my hand too when it happened since I was turning it under force. Valve has always been stiff like Frank said, but now over the years exposed to weather (MI) it's broken; have to use channel locks to operate. Wondering now if there is a handle-only replacement since the installation will be a major undertaking if replacement of the entire valve is required."
1,What garbage.,"Stupid me. I hated the first volume then bought the set. And I still hated it, hoping it would get better. The series is just too repetitive and a real story doesn't kick in until very late. Very terrible indeed, I should have listened to one guy who use to review here. Seriously, you can buy something blind folded and pick anything better than this. Terrible series, made me very grumpy. If I learned one thing about this, the five star reviewers wouldn't know a good anime series if it kicked them in the balls."
4,Satisfied,Some anime don't follow the original storyline of the manga counter parts to well but Hell Girl did pretty good. I was definitly satisfied with it.
5,unbelievably fantastic product!!!,"I have used anti-icky poo for years - told about it by a vet. It takes out the cat urine scent that other products leave behind. You have to keep the area moist for a substantial period of time, can't remember how long, in order for it to get rid of the odor completely. They now have more products - don't know about those, just the original one. I'm back here on Amazon to order more."
5,Stink no more,"Once you start to use this stuff and read all it's good for, you'll buy it by the gallon, too."
3,cat peeing,ordered the a gallon and used as directed. i even had carpet and padding replaced. the cat still peed in the area. hmmmmm not sure what to do
3,Need to keep reapplying in same areas,"I've been using this product for a while. It seems to help eliminate the urine odor, however, it does not stop the cat from spraying in the same area. Therefore, you need to keep reapplying on the same areas and this can get expensive since this product is not inexpensive."
3,icky-poo smell remover,well it came on time i used it and it seems to work for three weeks and then the smell came back ?what next
4,Good Price for product,"I received the product on time (within the estimation) so that way a plus.I heard this was a great product for cat urine.But for some reason it's not working out for me. I have a black light I shine on the spots and no matter how much I pour/spray and leave in I can still see the urine spot with the black light.I don't want to say anything bad about the product because it may just be my cat (Im taking him to the vet to see if he has a UTI,etc)In general though- it does smell nice (not bad in any way), and it is a simple product to use."
4,anti icky poo,"I have used the product before, works very well. It arrived when the seller said it would. No problems."
3,Hides the smell,"The product claims to remove, not just hide the smell. It seems to just hide the smell and not remove the culprit."
3,Used multiple times,"I have purchased Anti Icky Poo several times. With 3 animals it helps, not perfect but pretty good. I mainly use it on pee spots ."
3,Not so impressed,I've used Anti Icky Poo before and loved it. This time I don't feel it worked very well. Maybe it's the Unscented version that's not as effective. I don't think I would go to the expense or hassle to get this product again.
1,Waste of Money,"As I wrote for it's ""companion"" product, I tried several products, none of them worked including this one. I hired a professional carpet-cleaning company which is what I suggest to anyone with a per odor problem. The professional cost me the same amount as what I spent trying all the different products."
2,Not for Cat urine!,"Just moved to a home with lots of cat stains and smells. I have thrown out the carpets, pads, and even base trim. washed the stained areas and have saturated the spots with this product 3 times, and it still smells of cat urine. This may work on other problems but this is not the solution for cat urine smell.."
4,Probably as good as it gets,I purchased this item to remove cat urine odor from my carpet. I've tried other pet stain and odor removers and this is probably the best at removing odors- but it's not perfect. Perfect would be that the odor is totally gone and I can't say that is the case. All of these removers also seems to leave a strange residue. I give this 4 stars because it is a good product. Buy more than you think you'll need. You really need to soak the area.
5,Finally! Something that works!,"Our cat has been spraying for years and we've tried several different cleaners. This is the first one we've found that seems to decrease the problem. I recommend you use it in conjunction with Feliway - clean the area, then spray Feliway to make your cat think it doesn't need to spray there again."
3,Okay . . . But not exceptional,"Anti Icky Poo works about as well as other deoderizers we have tried. My wife is a Vet and we thought this might be the end all solution to odor problems from cats. Unfortunately, the claims we have seen DO NOT prove out during actual use. The vendor we purchased from provided a fair price and great service, we certainly do not hold them responsible for the product itself. Probably won't buy this product again."
2,Didn't work for me,I have a goodly number of cats with some bad habits and this product would have been very welcome-had it worked.
4,Excellent product.,"Cat urine smell came out after 2 applications, & 1 refresher spray. I put the cushion outside to air out while processing with the Icky Poo, cuz it does get worse before it gets better. Only one concern I wasn't happy with, I put it on my seude cushion, and it left a light stain. But would still highly recommend the product."
2,Not any better,"The only thing I liked about this product was the initial ""smell"" and the fact it could be diluted (if the spot wasn't ""too"" bad) I mean this is cat pee....how could it not be bad? Anyway, I've had just as good of results as other products I used and the other products I have used, of course, do not need to be ordered. I might use it again? But I am not convinced."
1,NOT THAT GREAT,I THOUGHT THIS WOULD STOP THE PEEING ON THE SIDE OF THE TUB BUT I USED THIS FULL FORCE CLEANED EVERYTHING AND HE STILL DOES IT.
2,Doesn't fit my charger,"Unlike many NIMH C-cells, which are AA guts in a C-size shell, this one is a full 5000ma-h cell. The problem is that they don't quite fit my charger.The overall length is normal, but the ""shoulders"" come up a bit higher than standard, so the + contact doesn't reach quite far enough into the contact cavity to make contact with the terminal on my charger. If you use a charger where the contacts are at or above the surface, you should be OK."
3,"Good knock-off but not the ""real deal"" Li Hing","As another member wrote, there's nothing really natural in this product. It's a ""knock-off"" of the true Li hing you get in Hawaii. This product has aspertame and licorice, two ingredients not in the original formula used all over Hawaii. However, they DO use this brand too in Hawaii, but not at the quality locations."
4,Main stove,"Since my indoor stove does not have a true hood vent to outside, I simply use this stove outside on my patio every day. I have used it every day for 3 years as my main cooking source. The burners show no sign of failing any time soon. Simply, the grates have some rust, and the chromed manifold bar has rust as well. The only design problem is that the bottom plate is not designed to keep bits of food contained, so dropped bits of food fall through to the deck. With some modifications this could be much better. IE stainless cooking grate, fully sealed bottom plate. Very windy conditions are somewhat of a problem, have to turn up the heat to prevent the flame from blowing out, and/or shift the pots to where the flames are at."
3,rolling cart,I ordered this to hold a 30lb bag of dog food. It does not hold the entire bag like it states it will. I really needed the larger model. I wish it would have shown me all the sizes available when I ordered. Other than that it is exactally as pictured and made very well. works great. Delivery took a little while but overall I am happy.
5,Awesome Product,Very Pleased. Wonderful colors & look amazing on the wall. My son absolutely loves them & goes great with his new spiderman bed.
5,Lots of decals,"This one is great, a lot of stickers to post on wall. I didn't have any problem sticking on walls, closet doors and drawers. My toddler loves them!"
5,Spiderman,My Grandson was sooooo excited. (he's 3). I don't even have 13 more words to describe his joy. Why is there a minimum
4,Solid product,"Great product for my almost 2 year old. He loves having it on his walls... But... one of the Spider-man decals fell off about 2 weeks of having it on the wall, but, I just placed it back on the wall and smoothed it out, and thus far no worries!"
3,spiderman wall decals,My Son loves his spiderman room . These are so cool. They go on the wall easily and can be removed with our ruining the paint on the wall. Great product!
3,Great room addition!,"These are a great value! I don't think they will last as long as I would hope, but none the less a great value!"
4,Review of organisational structure and innovation.,"If you've ever wondered what's wrong in the organisation you work for, why results are poor, why departments can't work together, why the best people keep leaving and why the rest feel helpless and miserable; this is the book for you. It's an academic text and the author draws strongly from her own research in several different organisations, some of whom she cannot name so gives them her own names - have fun guessing who they are. Of particular value is the section on roadblocks to managerial innovation, or how to prevent organisational success. A definite gift for your boss, but first erase all your comments like ""that's us!"" or ""we do that!"" because there will be plenty."
4,Brings several important themes together,"This book was meaningful to me because it documents the relationship between an open organizational environment, individual employee productivity, and innovation."
3,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!,I bought this book wanting a step by step tutorial. This book has that but there is no companion CD or website so I can do the steps and compare to what is already in the book. It really pisses me off. I was so prepared to have a great time learning Excel-VBA with this book. Maybe someone can give me some advice as to what they did in order to follow along with the book.
1,Load of crap,"This is undoubtedly the worst book I have personally read on programming. The author has written/co-written excellent books such as ""Office XP; The Complete Reference"" but she is an expert in Access and definitely not in VBA. Why she would attempt to provide a guide to VBA is beyond comprehension when she is an accomplished author of other excellent books in her field of expertise. I regret purchasing this rubbish and would advise all other JK fans to avoid the embarrasment of doing the same."
2,Not in color,"Personnaly, i found learning new things easy, if the book is in color design. Before purchasing i look inside the book and other than the material, i liked it since it is in color. However, when i got the book, got suprised since it is in black and white."
1,Absolutely Useless,"This is the worst self help book I have read in about a decade.Some key observations:1. The examples were selected to present well with the title with the word ""visually"".2. Most of example macros are beneath beginner. The same macros can be created just as efficiently in a macro recorder.3. Only the Userform Chapter has useful content."
4,nice service,Have been looking around for this book in stores but could not find it anywhere. The response to my queries was quite fast too. Thanks!
2,A very poor version,"I recently bought this(elsewhere), and was disapointed to find that this current version does not contain music to go with the film. To me, a ""score"" in a silent film is essential to the enjoyment of the movie, whether it fits perfectly or not. I've not seen another version, but this one seems to be edited terribly. I may be wrong about this, but I've seen other Lang films from this era and they did not seem to be as choppy as this one."
2,Don't Expect Metropolis,"This is a must-see for students of Fritz Lang, but lacks the overall entertainment that has survived seven decades in ""Metropolis"" and ""Siegfried,"" Lang's other silent fantasy epics. My draw to these and later Lang films is first the imagery, and secondly the sense of suspense and paranoia Lang infused in his movies of all genres. In ""Kriemhild"" the most interesting shots are repeats from ""Siegfried,"" of which this film is a sequel. There are a few large sets and a big fire scene, but in general ""Kriemhild"" is devoid of fantasy and spectacle, as if it had little to do with the magical world of the preceding film. As for suspense, well, since there are no interesting characters the main suspense has to do with waiting for the end of the film to come."
5,Spectacular clarinet playing,"For a variety of reasons, the NSO does not have many recordings to its credit; therefore, at first glance one might assume that a CD featuring conductor Antal Dorati would involve the Minnesota Orchestra. Not the case in this two-CD collection of orchestral works by Tchaikovsky. In particular, an inner track of Francesca da Rimini features the NSO of Washington, DC. Recorded in 1973, it showcases the amazing talent of the then newly appointed Principal Clarinetist Loren Kitt, who assumed his postion in 1970. With tone and legato reminiscent of Harold Wright, this recording is a must have for any clarinetist preparing for an audition requiring this excerpt."
2,Battery 12 voldt (drop ship pack),"Battery was received with no packing slip, and the plastic housing onthe battery was cracked. My husband fixed the battery (blue plastichousing) but I feel it should not have been delivered in that condition,and with no ""packing slip""."
3,How Long Does the Battery Last?,I was just wondering how long does the battery last if you follow all of the instructions? Thanks.
4,Peg Perego battery,"Our grand kids (4) have ridden the J.D. Gator for about 6 years- same battery. A suggestion that may help your battery last longer: The battery charge should not be depleted. When the vehicle begins to slow and strain, it's time for a recharge. I have kept the battery charged throughout this time and it has done very well. However, during a few recent rides, with all 4 kids here, they ran it until it almost stopped, several times. So of course, the battery will no longer hold a charge, will need to be replaced. Generally, same holds true for automobile batteries, motorcycle batteries, etc. Motorcyclists often use a charger (Battery Tender, etc) to prevent discharge during non-riding seasons. The Gator battery discharges through being ridden, and also slowly discharges ""just setting"". So keeping the battery charged will generally extend the life of the battery significantly (unless of course the battery is defective, which is not common)."
5,my grandaughters love it,"amazon is greatttttttttt there are no other place that you can get great deals ...and good people to deal with...never had a bad exp yet..good stuff ,good people and good prices...."
1,Dont buy this battery,"This battery is terrible. My son can only play for an hour on a full charge before it dies. I went out and bought a 12v Deep Cycle battery with 12amp and couldn't be happier. For 50.00 my son can ride his tractor all day long, no fusses. Some reviewers said you had to splice the new battery wires,thats not the case. I brought mine to battery exchange and they took the plug in off the peg perego battery and attached it to the new battery. Easy as pie. Would suggest everyone do the same"
4,It was an identical to OEM replacement,"Man these things are expensive, but when your child's neck whips back when stepping on the accelerator you realize that your old battery WAS weak. Came charged!"
3,Use Motorcycle Battery,"I also looked into purchasing this item, but read an earlier review of someone who placed a small 12 volt lawn tractor or motorcycle battery into the toy gator with success. I purchased a 12 volt motorcycle battery and used the connector from the previous dead prego battery. This allowed me to attach the new motorcycle battery to the gator. When I removed the wires from the old battery I removed the blue cap, and was able to save the fuse that is built in. Anyway, it works great was half the cost, and I can hook it up to my 12 volt battery charger. In order to be the new battery to fit I had to enlarge the battery box, by doing some cutting. I was not real pretty, but my daught is not picking dates up with it."
4,Grandkid's Toy,"This battery was expensive! Little bitty thing, but HEAVY. The grandkids come to the farm and ride the John Deere Gator. The battery stopped working after 2 years use. Got the new battery, charged it -- and the little ones are happy again. Amazon is cheaper than the John Deere dealer....The only thing better is being in front of Dad or Grandpa on the real John Deere tractors."
5,Great for a backup,Bought this for a backup battery & it was well worth it. We charge one while the backup battery keeps the kids entertained.
1,I received a broken battery,I received a broken battery.It came in a bag.I sent it back and requested one be sent to me in a box.I recieved a second broken battery in a bag.
3,works great,"put this in my sons peg perego craftsman tractor. This is the larger battery (for the larger vehicles) but the smaller tractor will accomodate it and the tractor runs like the Energizer bunny with this new battery. If your kid rides alot and you have the narrow battery, if your vehicle will handle the larger battery I highly recommend it because it will run alot longer between charges."
1,Buyer Beware,"Battery is way overpriced. Contact Battery Store near you! I did and found this same exact battery type(2-6volt Batteries) for much less. While there they told me I could use a low amp 12v Deep Cycle battery instead. It did take some time wiring (FUSED LINK IS A MUST) but is well worth it. Lasts all day and you can charge it at a 2 amp ""trickle charge"" with a ""amp selectable"" car battery charger. All told it cost me less than $60 for everything. It now longer just ""Takes Up Space""."
2,BUY A SPORTS BATTERY INSTEAD,"We took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and bought a sports/motorcycle battery at WalMart. Not only was it cheaper, but what a difference in performance. Our grandson can ride it all day long on our farm up and down hills over all types of terrain with full power and no charge. There have been times when he rode all day, came back a week later and rode all day again without a charge. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested this, it's a great alternative to this expensive battery that will not last as long."
1,Buy an all purpose battery instead,"Once you take off the blue wiring harness and the cover, all you have is a regular 12 volt, 8 amp battery. Just search for a ""1280 battery"" and you will pay about 1/3 the cost. I picked up both a 1280 battery and a charger on ""[...]"" for a little over $30. You can probably buy the battery by itself for about $20. All you have to do is snap off the old blue cover and unplug the wiring harness. Reuse the wiring harness with the inline fuse and you are good to go, and you can still use the old charger. The only challenge is that the clips from the wiring harness to the new battery may be a different size. If you are handy at all, modifying that isn't a problem.Who wants to pay $60 for a toy battery?"
4,Difficult to put down,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable read, with believable characters who came straight out of the pages to have coffee in my lounge. I'll miss them - what a shame the book doesn't lend itself to a sequel! And for those of you who disapprove of extramarital affairs, rest assured that the moral of the story is, er, absolutely moral."
3,easy reading chick lit,"An interesting idea as background to the novel, although the story centres more around Stephanie than the agency in question. Light reading for the summer, nothing too taxing."
3,Novice seminary student,"This book was a required text for a elective class I took in grad school. While I really enjoyed this class, I wasn't thrilled with this text. I am an avid reader, and usually can at least get through any text and with this one it was a challenge. I didn't like how the author worded sentences, and sometimes it was hard with his choice of language tense to understand what he was saying. Perhaps it is personal preference, but I struggled (and I am not a poor reader.... I read peer reviewed case work all the time for other classes.)Aside from this, it was an informative text. So if you are looking for a glimpse in to this time period, and you can slog on through, you will learn."
4,Very good text,"This is a well thought-out, modern text to acquaint the reader with church history. I Highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the subject"
4,"Good, but I've read better","This is the text we are using at the seminary that I attend. I recently graduated from the University of Sioux Falls (SD) with a major in Theology and Philosophy. In the Church History class there, we used Justo Gonzalez's book The Story of Christianity: The Early Church to the Present Day, and I greatly enjoyed that book. Ferguson's book is fine, but it is a fairly choppy read compared to the longer but steadier flow of thought in Gonzalez's. I recommend the latter if you want a good book on church history."
4,"Cute, quick read",Fun story. Would have been nice if the book went more into Denis' character but it was still a pleasant read
5,Leather is leather,"Replaced original metal band for my Timex Men's T41101 ExpeditionThe leather band is great looking. I reused my original Lugs (Spring bar), great fit.I'm going back to Amazon to buy a nylon one band because I keep getting the leather one wet and it's going to fall apart soon. Product is great, just material doesn't fit my use."
5,Great band,Fit my Timex Expedition perfect. The order shipped fast and looks great! Can not breat the price to extend the life of our watch.
4,A real mess saver,"We used elevated toilet seats at the hospital and rehab center, but they had no splash guard. I was contemplating creating my own when I saw these on line. It fills the bill perfectly...no more messes on the floor in front of the commode!Inexpensive and works perfectly."
3,Good for the complete novice,"I found that the book was directed more toward complete novices. The book was overly detailed for a person with even limited experience. The book also addressed specific types and brand names of equipment that the author used, while only brielfy touching on other options available. A novice wishing to follow the equipment recommendations to the letter should be aware that his choices were also very expensive, particularly for people who may only make one trip a summer. I much preferred Cliff Jacobson's ""Boundary Waters, Canoe Camping with Style"". Jacobson offers route recommendations, excellent illustrations, recipes and a miriad of equipment choices. He also provides a list of manufacturers in the appendix."
1,If I Ran the Circus,"This is a perfect example of why we should read descriptions before purchasing material on-line. I was purchasing children's books about the circus and saw this audio offering. I should have read the description before purchasing to see that it included murder and crucifixton, rather than imagination about youngsters and leadership in the circus. Silly grown-up I am!"
4,amazing experimental music,"This cd is for people with ears for the unexpected. Todd can go all over the place with crazy ideas, but just when you get sick of all these changes, he put in grooving thoughtful instrumentals to round out the record. I am so impressed."
5,Good reference,"I really liked this book. It showed how artists kinda grow up from graffiti to graphic design, that it's more proffesional. It had some great pictures. Every artist has a job description of what they do etc. Its in german and english, so you all should know. I got what i expected from it. Alot of the artist include CMPONE,123 KLAN, TYPEHOLICS, BACKYARD 10 ETC. It gives you alot of great ideas also of course.The cd that it comes with is alright the ""so called soundrack"" that they speak of is only one song that i think is really horrible. It has some cool fonts, and wallpapers too.This is a must for a you graff heads."
2,Pump Sprayer Fails After a Few Uses,"I have had several of the pump sprayers fail. I've tried transferring the product into my own sprayers, but then I waste a lot of the product. The sprayers work for a few uses then just stop. I like the repellant, but I'm having trouble getting it applied effectively."
5,no ticks!,I have never seen a tick on a child that has this on. We have a bad tick problem around here and I consider this spray an essential item.
5,There is some divine guidance behind these two musicians,"After many years exploring music (mostly through the piano) in a deeply, almost religious way, I get more and more surprised and fascinated with every note Mr. Werner plays on the keyboard. The intention behind each harmonic and melodic movement is so lyrically intense and new that I feel Mr. Werner evoking things that my life-long guru (Keith Jarrett- pianist) hasn't explored yet (How can this be?).It was through KWerner that I discovered this heavenly voice."
5,Good Book.,This was a good book in that it concluded the series. Don't read this book until you have read the first two.
2,too short,"these straps are far shorter than other straps i have owned in the last decade. also, the material is coarse, unlike the white cotton straps made in USA."
1,"Inexpensive, but a waste of money","They didn't cost much, but they're really uncomfortable. Very stiff and really dug into my wrists. Tossed them in the garbage and bought the Altus Lifting Straps. Much, much better."
3,Mediocre,Decent lifting straps. Does a good job for grip and taking pressure off of wrists but material can be coarse. Does come undone often after a few uses which can be annoying.
1,Breaking,I bought these straps off here and thought they would be awesome. First of all I paid too much. I didn't think they were cheaper in the store. Second of all after using them 5 TIMES!!! THEY BROKE!!!!! What is up with that? I wouldn't recommend these straps.
3,Required Modification to Fit,"The item description, ""Fits Casio Data Bank,"" wasn't true for my CDB watch. But once I realized a 22mm band was too wide, I measured my watch and then used an Xacto knife to *carefully* trim off two tiny squares of rubber from each half of the new band. It now fits and looks fine."
4,Casio Watch Strap,Delivered on time with the proper tools and instruction to replace the strap. Took me only a few minutes to do so.
5,Great product,"The product is an excellent replacement for the broken strap on my casio databank watch. Installation was very quick and easy, using the included pins."
3,It Fits the Casio Watch,The band does fit the Casio DB30 watch. It's a little bit shorter in length than the original one. It is a little thinner than the original and has a cheaper feel. The band was about 8 bucks and I could have bought a new watch (DB30) from Amazon for 24 dollars. I probably should Have just ordered the watch.
5,My Third band,I have had my Casio Calculator Watch for about 10 years now. While the watch keeps on ticking the bands don't. This is my third band and I like this one better than the original one. It is very comfortable. Only time will tell if it is more durable.
3,wrong width band,Voguestrap TX22G3 Allstrap 22mm Black Regular-Length Fits Casio Data Bank Watchband. Data Bank that I have uses 17-mm band; TX22G3 is a 22-mm band. I used a razor blade to cut down and it is working but should get the right band.
4,good replacement,"This is a good replacement for a genuine casio watchband. The price is right, delivery time was excellent and it fits as good as original. As a plus, two spring pins were included with the watchband as a surprise ( they were NOT advertized as included in the description before placing the order). The band is just a little SHORT for my liking, but does work nicely. I tend to wear my watch a bit on the loose side and when hooked in the second hole the sliding keeper does not stay put on the end of the strap. The watchband is soft and flexible and should last at least as long as the original Casio band for about 1/3 the cost."
3,Nice starter piggy bank,"This is a nice small piggy bank that will be a nice gift for a young child. I bought it for my son, who happens to like it very much."
5,Great Documentary!!,This is a great documentart of the reknowned actor/comedian Ernie Kovacs.It's highly recommended!!
1,"Uh, wait a minute! Not the original albums!","bMG made a big mistake in reissuing these two albums! Shame on you BMG! The album He'll Have To Go is not the 1959 album which is the original version it and has songs such as I'm Beginning To Forget You, Home, Partners, After A While, He'll Have To Go and others! This album is simply a useless compelation of live radio broadcasts which are on several other CD's and the Tall Tales And Short Tempers album!The version of Danny Boy is not t he released version with the Anita Kerr Quartet! BMG you should check before you release albums like this! I of course havve all of these albums on the big 16 CD box set but do not and I'm warning all fans out there, do not buy this album because they are not the original albums!"
1,where is my 3.5 AMP HOUR BATTERY,The Battery that I received is a 3.3Ah instead of the 3.5Ah that I ordered and that was on my packing slip. Whats up with that?
3,Elizabethian Era novel,"The Merry Maid is a book about a young girl who ends up in England during Queen Mary's reign. She is eventually adopted by a stable, if not aristocratic, women. The story moves on when she leaves and falls in love, becoming a travelling performer with her new husband like her deceased father had originally taught her. All in all, it's an entertaining historical novel, including aspects of the change from Mary to Elizabeth's reign. Nothing too profound, nor too clichéd. More realistic than Victoria Holt, but along the same vein."
4,Hysterical!,"A comedy tour-de-force by some of the funniest names in the business. Well known funny men Steve Martin and Rick Moranis are paired with brilliant and extremely intelligent writers such as Bruce McCall. The real strength of this compilation, however, rests on ithe inclusion of brilliant newcomers like Holly Smith, Tim Harrod, and Judy Grued. Read it if you dare!"
1,Where's The Mirth?,"Rarely have I been as disappointed with a book as I was with this one. I love a good laugh, and picked this book up while on a business trip, expecting to have a good chuckle while on the airplane, but alas it was not like that at all.There were one or two gems in here, but mostly this is a collection of ""almost funny"" stories and essays. Many of the writers here are trying way too hard to be hip and intellectual.You will find more laughs per page in this month's issue of ""The Economist"" magazine. Do yourself a favor and skip this book. Try anything by Woody Allen or P.G. Wodehouse instead."
2,This is funny?,"Ok, granted, there ARE a FEW things in here that deserve a chuckle, but for the most part, this stuff is pure drivel. Definitely not a ""sit-down-and-read-it-all-in-one-go"" book, but even when broken up into small chunks, you'll spend forever and a day looking for something that's truly funny."
5,Ahhhh! Meditation...,"The compositions on this CD are meditation enhancing. I have it playing in the background when I am studying and writing sermons. I find the music relaxing and rejuvenating. It is a must for anyone who enjoys thinking. Gary Takesian is a talented, inspired artist. More! I want more!"
5,beautiful,i loved it! very relaxing. gary is very talented. i look forward to more music in the future!
1,Not worth your time or money!,"This book is so horribly outdated that it is a joke. If you want to know how marketing worked in the 80s, then this book is for you! If you have no idea what the Yellow Pages are, then this book is for you! Duct Tape Marketing is much, much better."
4,Local Advertising Can Work,"The 200 page book is written in a easy-to-read format -- full of tidbits that can help a business reach its local, targeted market. I read this along with a book on radio advertising hoping to get a greater insight into what may work for a new product we are launching.I read pretty fast so it was worth the two hours I spent with it. It has information that can be referred to again and again as one executes on a local marketing program.http://mop-jdh.blogspot.com/2009/01/radio-advertizing-can-work-for-right.html"
5,A must-read for any local business,"The rules in this book are timeless and effective, and branded as ""ruthless"" because they are essential to the core in that they cannot be broken. A big mistake that local businesses continue to make when it comes to advertising is that they fall into the trap of following the national perceptions and trends, ignoring the focus on a local level. This book demands local businesses keep their focus where it needs to be. Even though the book was published before the advent of social media, the section on Common Sense Marketing still applies to how local businesses effectively navigate through the social media networks to advertise. A highly recommended read."
5,Must have for business owners,"If I would have had this book years ago, I could have saved thousands of dollars in wasted advertising. This book teaches you how to spend you dollars effectively to grow your business."
5,The ultimate conspiracy theory,"I read this back when it first came out and I thought it was both hilarious and thought-provoking. Worth reading. I'm glad it's still available, albeit only used.Basically, it is Macbeth rewritten to explain JFK's assassination. Kennedy = KenneDunc (Duncan), LBJ = MacBird (Macbeth) , Lady Bird = Lady MacBird (Lady Macbeth)---you get the picture."
2,Not what I expected,"I am a dental hygiene student and I bought this dental dictionary to help me define words in my dental anatomy class. I was very disappointed when I got the book. It did not have words such as, triangular ridge, mesiotriangular fossa, transverse ridge, etc. It also had very few illustrations. I wish I would have bought Mosby's dictionary instead."
2,CRAP,"I give it 2 stars because it cuts but its not at all what I thought was in the ad on here I think the ad is misleading, its a single flute unless you want to cut backwards then forwards it would be a double flute."
3,this should have been a monster,"i must first say ,i like uli's singing with the scorpions it was a nice contrast to klaus m.....with that said,this album should have been a monster!!!but the reason it wasnt for me was the singing..the music is awesome!!!!the songs are good but the vocals always leave me wishing he had used someone else(like Dio maybe) or at least redid them until they had more punch and less vibrato.this is the first solo uli that i have purchased and granted the copywright says 1994 so im 8 years behind so i am more than willing to listen to more of his stuff to see if it gets better.keep on rockin!"
4,"It was great, but it's missing one thing!","Oh man oh MAN do I love these tapes! However, after watching all of them, I've noticed that one thing is missing: The Piper's Pit segment from Wrestlemania 5!!!!!! It was included in the little pamphlet that came with the boxed set for the Wrestlemania 5 card, but the Piper's Pit segment IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND ON THE WRESTLEMANIA 5 TAPE!!!!"
5,WrestleMania: The Review,"While not a big fan of the ""WWF Attitude"" box set, the bottom line is that A) It's cheaper than the original retail price of the original new releases (check out the original pre-views, hit a rental store, or look at old wrestling magazines for more info if you don't believe, but these tapes cost as much as one PPV TODAY ($39.95 for WM IV alone!). Yes, it's over $100, and almost $200, but divide that cost by 14-15 tapes, and the resulting figure is quite nice. Now, consider buying each tape individually at $10 a tape, or even $8 a tape and compare the difference. I promise it is significant. ESCPECIALLY if you are looking for the Coliseum video version, which can run anywhere from $20-80 each, depending on the seller. There are slight differences and edits in the footage on each different version of WM, but it's always nice to be able to get a collection of items all at one time, and at a discounted price. Recommended."
2,Take notice before buying because it's not ALL here.,"I like the tapes but don't love them. They were taped at the SLP Speed, cut & edited for time,and you can see the ropes through the wrestlers. And it's very noticeable when the cuts take place. So at best the tapes are average, but I think at 149.00 (retail) it could have and should have been a lot better.So take notice of this before buying."
1,I don't like it but I do but its ok but only sometimes.,I don't like it but I do but its ok but only sometimes. WCW RULES!!!!!!! And so does WCW LIVE! at WCW.COM!!! Bob Ryder and Jermy Borish are the BEST!!!!
1,destroy this tape!!!!!,"no wait don't even buy this. if you do you are endorsing brain-dead, steroid addicted dumb s**ts. these guys need to get in a room and kill each other and do the world a lot of good... wake up people!!!!!!!!"
1,Garbage that needs to be wasted,"If any entertainment in the world is trashy it is wrestling. I think it is just stupid to go to a sports event that is fiction. I like watching Ultimite Fighting Championship, because the fighting is real. I think people that watch wrestling need to get a life."
3,It's not a new book,I received a book that has marks with a pen on the cover. So it's not a new book as declared! I feel cheated.
1,what a rip off,I bought this thinking it was acontinuation or exploration of the concept of psychohistory invented in the 1930's by Isaac Asimov in his Robot novels and later expanded upon in his Foundation series. This was nothing more than a blatant rip off of a concept founded by a real scientist and abused by another want-to-be scientist (AKA pschologist).
1,Poorly machined and drill bits wobble,"I wish I hadn't purchased this drill. I wish I had taken the time to return it for a refund. I get angry when I assemble it and try to use it. I was surprised how poorly the gears on the drive wheel mesh with the other gears. It doesn't make a whirring sound--it clangs. The biggest flaw is that the chuck won't hold a drill bit on axis. As a result, the tip of the drill bit moves around in a little circle instead of purely rotating on its axis. For that reason, I consider this drill to fall below merchantable quality, and I give it the lowest rating of 1 star."
1,Waste of Money,"This was a complete waste of money. The chuck does not hold bits firmly or on center, making it totally worthless. If you taped a bit to a screwdriver you'd get a more accurate hole. I'm giving mine to the neighbors kid. Go to ebay & buy a used Stanley."
1,A highly self-indulgent author misses the point completely,"Dave Stone is certainly impressed with himself. Much of this silly book is written with an overwhelming feeling that the author patted himself on the back after writing each sentence. He would write an ironic paragraph, then spend the next two paragraphs explaining why it was ironic and wasn't it clever of him to have thought of it. He writes the Doctor as some sort of superbeing with superstrength and mind-reading abilities (never demonstrated in the Who universe) who infers everything going on without ever having the facts. This story is bloody and violent and frankly ridiculous. The only redeeming quality is the character of Queegvogel and his arcane speech. Run, run, run away from this one."
1,CD was scratched and skips,"I bought this used CD from ohio-media. The CD was scratched and skips. The text box I am now typing in makes it unclear whether I'm rating the CD or the seller. So I'll review both.I won't use ohio-media again since they claimed the CD played perfectly on their CD player.The music itself is not only beautiful, but well performed and recorded."
2,Only one disc,"I wish I'd noticed that this ""starter set"" consists of a box for several discs- but only one disc. The price made me assume it was several discs (which I must now buy severally).The series is wonderful. I love both the theme (that vengeance is costly) and artistic presentation. I will buy more discs, just wish I didn't have to."
2,Yuck ....,"Tart is an adult graphic novel about a young girl whose insatiable desire for sex infects everyone who comes in contact with her. Strangely, every scene of intense sexuality ends with some form of violence, with a frustrated onlooker or participant resorting to fists or guns when they can no longer satisfy their sexual needs.The technical skills of the artist are average. Better than many other Eros comix but paltry in comparison to van Gotha, Duvet or Noe. The majority of the illustration is in simple B&W ink drawing, however, several pages are in full colour.The problem with Tart is wierd anatomy of the main character. Tart is anorexic, with mishapen breast and a deformed clitorous. She is visually unappealing."
1,Disappointed,"I'm taking Wilton cake decorating classes, so I purchased several cake decorating books to practice the techniques I've been learning. This book is an art book as far as I can see. This book should be in the watercolor or tole painting section, not in cake decorating at all."
4,Four Pennies - '2 Sides Of The Four Pennies / Mixed Bag' (Beat Goes On),"First title on the Beat Goes On label that I've listened to in sometime. Notice that they usually release plenty of should-have 2-fer-1 CD's. Like this one, of the British Invasion band (one that I've never heard of) the Four Pennies. Here, you get their two lp's on this nifty 2-fer-1 '2 Sides Of The Four Pennies' ('64) and 'Mixed Bag' ('66). Total of twenty-six tracks to enjoy. Some of the better cuts include the catchy ""Claudette"", ""Love's Journey"", ""Pony Time"", ""Why Do You Cry"", the sweet-sounding ""Without Love"" and ""Try To Find Another Man"". Line-up: Lionel Morton - rhythm guitar & vocals, Mike Wilsh - bass, keyboards & backing vocals, Fritz Fryer - guitar and Alan Buck - drums. Highly recommended for fans of the Merseybeats, The Hollies, The Searchers, Honeycombs, Herman's Hermits and the Applejacks."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"Although it is nice to have a volume that takes the Elvis Presley screen oeuvre at least somewhat serious, ""Elvis: The Hollywood Years"" seems to have been compiled by a European author unfamiliar with American show business history at large and whose ""research"" was limited to secondary British sources. How else could he possibly have come to the conclusion that ""Uncle"" Milton Berle was a ""chubby comedian,"" or that Steve Allen proved to be a ""stuffy"" bigot? (The author obviously confuses Allen with Ed Sullivan) Or marvel over the fact that ""G.I. Blues"" beat ""The African Queen"" at the box-office. (Why shouldn't it have; ""The African Queen"" was celebrating its 10-year anniversary in 1961.) And on and on it goes. Never mind that according to author Bret half of Hollywood was gay, including -- hint, hint -- Elvis himself!; that, after all, has become de rigeur for this type of hit-and-run film book."
3,It's Good For The Diehard Collector,"I would have to say this is for sure my least favorite out of all the CKY dvds. It's not horrible but it just doesn't hold the magic that all the other CKY videos have. It's pretty much just the out takes from all the other videos. But I will say I really like the commentary by Bam and the crew.Even without a shining review I would still highly recommend buying this but only if you already love and own the other CKY movies and if you are truly a die hard fan. I just couldn't have the others without having this one to complete the whole collection.What I really want now is a CKY 5!!! Or shoot, skip 5 and just move on to 6, I don't care I just reallywant a new CKY release!! I would pay $50 for one I'm craving Bam and the crew so bad. Luckily we get some of that with Jackass 3-D, and even as great as that is it will never topple the almighty CKY series. Come on Bam please release a new CKY!!"
4,Enjoyable,"I myself am a huge cky fan ang I love the other 4 movies, this one is kind of the origin of the movies and band cky. It truly is for hardcore fans only though so if you haven't seen Cky 1-4 then do that before you watch this."
4,No Comment,"Well I must say it is an ok video for those that like or love CKY, it isn't like the others with stunts and stuff. It's just one of those videos that tells pretty much how to rob a house but really doesn't cause it's all funny like, but overall it's a must have for the huge CKY fans... And I must brag I have all the CKY cds and videos *Smiles*"
3,Just a start!,"This is merely a start for an interest in Native coastal/northwest art.It was interesting for me, living here, to get some perspective about the fabulous pole art here, and others near by."
5,Excellent creeper,"I have used this creeper at other jobs and I have loved it. For a creeper with no padding it is pretty comfy,light weight and no square corners for air hoses to hang on. No flip up head rest to pinch your fingers on, good wheels and very strong construction."
4,This thing is a life saver,"This has by far been the best creeper I have ever owned. It offers good support while allowing me to roll freely. My favorite part about it is ""cupped"" to allow your body to stay low to the ground. this is very important for me as all my cars are sports cars and hard to get under to begin with. I am average size (5'10"", 175 lbs) and it fit well on this. I would not recommend it for individuals that are much larger or over 240 lbs as I do notice the plastic flexing enve under my weight. My one complaint is that when it is dry, the plastic build a static charge from rolling and dirt is statically attracted to it. It wouldn't stop me from buying it again though."
2,Missing Hardware,Received the product missing the hardware to attach the wheels. Poor packaging or too cheap to include the nuts and bolts.
4,Great Affordable Option,"Have had these speakers for 2 years now and they have held up and still sound good. Nice highs and surprisingly good bass. Not audiophile quality, but good for reasonable volume."
5,Love me some Johnnie!,"If you love Johnnie Taylor, you need to add this to you collection! I was not fortunate to grow up listening to Johnnie, but my husband did, he remembers listening to him coming and introduce me his music and I fell in LOVE!"
4,The CD is worth its price if you only love one song :-0,"I enjoyed this CD. The only reason that it is not my favorite is because it does not contain many of my old favorites.It does contain ""Soul Heaven"" and that is a hit!"
2,"It is probably too old, no fragrance.","I had had this perfume before and this one is not definitively the same.It lost all fragrance, and it has no fragrance like a perfume at all-it smells like chemicals and something else.Because it was unopened I supposed it was too old and probably it was not storage properly."
3,"An interesting perspective on super-powered humans, but ...","ABERRANT has a great idea that I had hoped that someone would publish someday: a super-hero game where the characters are people with unusual powers, not excuses for posturing and doing as much collateral damage as possible. The world that White Wolf presents is interesting and detailed (although it has the typical White Wolf jabs at authority and conspiracies). My only big problem with the game is the presentation. While very readable, the background section is ultimately an exercise in frustration in trying to get hard data about the world of ABERRANT. I eagerly look forward to the forthcoming additions to this line."

3,RPG,"A game that presumably is supposed to be part of a series, and done White Wolf style. No supernatural beings as such, but humans with super powered abilities, and the organisations, structures, regulations and problems that surround these people as they try and live their lives.Superheroes with a twist, in other words."
5,Beautiful,"I listen to this almost every day, I had watched the Movie Skins and her music was on the sound tract...I so enjoy it."
4,This ex-Marine can sing.,"Annie Humphrey sings from the heart with songs that have meaning. She sings from her Native American experience, from her female experience, and her life experience. What you won't hear here are brighty, poppy, bubble-gummy songs. What you will hear are songs with meaning sung by a woman with a beautiful alto voice. Enjoy."
3,"Folksy Pop, or...er...Poppy Folk...?","This collection of folk pop tunes makes for a pleasant if not particularly interesting listen. Humphrey's voice is sweet and earnest as are her melodies which feel comfortably familiar; they sound like any number of similar folky country, rock and jazz produced during the last 30 years. Lyricist Carson Gardener veers too often into high school poetry club territory and the recurring themes centering on the plight of Native Americans (Humphrey is herself Anishinaabe) are not expressed in such a way to give any particular sense of personal perspective, nor originality. This CD seems unlikely to please hard-core folkies as it is too pop centered, and unlikely to find a pop audience as it seems too sincere in its aims. I imagine that somewhere out there in the world a select group is clamoring for innocuous, pretty, inconsequential pop tunes with a folky American Indian vibe. Here's hoping Annie Humphrey finds them."
4,Useful for Non-Techies,"I found ""Joy of SOX"" a useful read, especially now that we are probably about to be further deluged with Sarbanes-type compliance issues. The book breaks it down: you don't have to be so frightened of SOx laws; in fact, conceptually, it can work in your favor. Pretty straightforward, well organized, written by someone who seems to get the management side of business, not just the technology area."
3,Joy of Sox,"Well written book, but too detailed about Sarbanes Oxley. I was looking for something with more emphasis on Service Oriented Architecture which is barely touched on in the book."
3,this weight will outlast the fish,little heavy but this a great product will keep the bait in the strike zone for a long timewhile you fish.
4,Keep a few spares,"It's a downrigger ball - but the rubber coating keeps you from having to touch lead (which is bad for you and accumulates over time). I like the cannon flash weights, and use them for Salmon in Puget Sound."
5,A tour de force,"What a wonderful book. Whether you are a computer scientist or mathematician with limited exposure to the discipline of speech processing, or alternatively you are a dedicated expert in this field, you will find everything you are looking for in this book. For two weeks, I couldn't put this thing down. And that's an extraordinary testimony to a book that's 800+ pages of technical detail. If you want a high level understanding of how speech processing works, or if you want to dig in and build your own speech engine, everything you need is right here."
3,OK... for a while,"They sounded decent for a year and two months before they blew, conveniently two months after the 1 year warranty expired."
5,Clarity,"I think most people changing there stock 4x6 speakers are going to have Delco. I thought that the stock delco speakers were very nice and didn't need to be changed. However after purchasing and installing these, all I can say is wow. There was so much of my music I was missing. The clarity and treble on these speakers are extremely nice, for the first time i heard a piano, i never knew of, in my favorite song. And the bass on these are also really nice.Sure more expensive speakers will sound even better but for this price, this is a excellent product and I'm extremely satisfied."
2,"Poor audio quality, sounds muffled","I guess I shouldn't have expected much from speakers at this price, but these really were very disappointing. The mids and highs were very muffled. It sounded like listening to a low bit-rate internet radio station on laptop speakers. Rather spend an extra $10-$20 and get yourself a decent pair of Pioneer or Rockford Fosgates."
3,Eh...,"These arent bad for $20. Better than stock, but if I did it again, i would pay $10 more for some better ones."
4,thumbs up,"Great value and music to my ears. They work well in the door with hifidelity on every note! Don""t pass this bargain up!"
3,"Basic speaker, great price, watch compatibility !","According to Amazon these speaker replace the front door speakers on a 1999 BMW 323 ( E46).Well if you have a dremel tool, drill and can build a mount, the speakers fit.:)That is, these are NOT a direct swap for the factory speakers. Note also these speaker are a different diameter than the original speakers and they are 4 ohm vs 2 ohm.Awesme price, assuming they last... But you have to work a bit to install them.."
2,You get what you pay for,"I only payed the 20 bucks for the product and i got what i payed for. I was replacing some old, worn down speakers and was really disapointed to find that these new speakers were not only weaker than the old speakers but also sounded worse than the old ones. I don't plan on buying Pyles again."
1,Poor quality speakers,Purchased these speakers and at first sound was great. Now a few weeks later the sound is very poor. Sounds like the speaker is broken
2,Bass - less,"Installed these in my Silverado. I replaced the, I thought cheap factory dual cone speakers. When I installed the first one and tested it, I thought the ""woofer"" was broken as the bass was ""bassically"" gone. As I broke the original but much better cheap factory dual cone, I decided to install only one pyle (of junk) speaker. I know that it only cost me $18.77 so I really cannot complain but a word of advice; unless you listen to only AM radio, spend a little more cash and buy something else."
3,They're ok,"The company I bought from was incredible!!! Ut other reviews were false , my stock jeep speakers were better just not what I was expecting from a high rated speaker"
3,Good Price.,As a 3 way goes this product does not handle bass very well at all. Easily over powered by a basic car stereo. Mid range and tweeter sound quality is good. The product fit well in my truck.
1,Blue Poly Fragments,"I purchased these Dec 2007 and recently the base and mids just went away. On furthur inspection the blue poly disintegrated. Unless you want speakers that last less than two years, look elsewhere for non-disintegrating speakers from different manufacture. I'm now looking also."
3,"Uhhh....OK, I guess","I acqquired these to replace the OEM 4"" speakers in the front of my Suzuki Sidekick (AKA K Mart Range Rover). Large magnet, good for the price. Chinese, of course. I was somewhat disappointed at the barely audible improvement over the OEM speakers at low volume levels. They do perform much better at higher volume levels, however."
4,Good Value,"These are good middle - high tone speakers suitable for Chrysler in dash replacements. They are very stable at 22 watts RMS and handle 50 watt peaks with clarity.For a budget speaker to upgrade standard factory stereo with a decent aftermarket CD player, AM/FM receiver these front speakers will do the job.Pair this setup with the Pyle 6 x 9 quadraxial ""blue series"" for rear speakers and you will have a good sounding system for the budget minded."
4,ok speakers,they got here quick good for the price just don`t push them to hard they will pop with a basic car stereo
3,These sound better than I thought they would,"For such a low price, the sound from these speakers is pretty crisp.The installation took some figuring out but it wasn't anything too terrible.The blue color is very nice, it was that and the cheap price that made me choose these over others.These are the first speakers I have bought, so I don't know TOO much about this kinda stuff but the sound is good enough for me."
4,pretty much a speaker,"i bought these to replace the tweeters on the top of my dash. besides having a surprising large amount of treble, all i can say is that in my eyes speakers are speakers. these are cheap, powerful and i don't see the reason to buy $110 pair of 4x6's that will work the same as these: GOOD BUY!"
3,Not so great.,"I got these for a 98 Cherokee rear speakers. I put one in and tested it against the factory speakers by adjusting the fade and balance and the Pyle is noticeably quieter than the factory speakers. I'm no audiophile, the sound quality is about the same as the factory speakers in my opinion, just quieter. So if you're looking to replace non working factory speakers, these would be just right for the price. If you want an upgrade in sound you should probably save your $20 and put it toward better speakers. Since these come with the thin red/black wires I plugged one into the home stereo and got tinny sound that lacked the volume of the other speaker. I'd give it fewer stars but the price is so cheap. It's not even worth returning them, maybe I'll use them for something.As soon as I find the stock speaker connector I'm going to put the factory speaker back in and put these on ebay or in a flea market."
4,Great Value Speaker!,"The only reason i knock off a star is because it rattles a bit, but im almost 100% sure its in my bad mounting skills.Im sure if you screw these things in good the rattling will be at a minimum.Sound very very VERY good for the price!Fit in my 99 solara just fine!"
3,Stock grade at most,"I installed these in my '95 Corolla with a new head unit which is nearly identical to the head unit in my friend's '96 Camry with stock speakers. His car's sound out-performed mine with his stock speakers when I had a comparable head unit and these speakers in the doors with their big brother 5.25"" ones on the back deck. If you listen to talk radio/ books on tape then these are perfect; they do the job without breaking the bank. If you're looking for a speaker that is even the slightest bit more powerful than your non blown-out stock speakers, look elsewhere."
3,Shouldn't be played to loud,"Obviously you get what you pay for, but these speakers worked great when I had them. They only lasted about 6 months with minimal bass going to them. One day they randomly just blew out, so I contacted the seller. He happily refunded me and helped me with another order. Thanks! I would not purchase these products again unless there were going into a car that I never played the volume above half way due to them blowing out at about 3/5 of my max volume. One last thing to add is that these speakers don't have much bass at all, I would give the bass a 2.5 out of 10."
1,Cheap,"Oh yeah, up for sale, the finest U.S. scrap sent back from China and delivered to your door. Ive bought a few speakers in my day, these speakers are the cheapest yet. Cheap price, cheap materials, and cheap sound to boot. 360 what? Watts? Turn em up half volume - snap - crackle - pop, full volume and blow! Way to go Pyle - Not really!"
2,this is not a good way to spend money,"i bought these speakers in september of 2010 and they doesnt work no more, dont buy it. i prefer to spend a little more in something better."
4,great love them,i have connected to an SSL 4.400 amp. had to disconnect them from the amp and connect direct to the radio. The highs are good and mid are all right.Car: 1995 Acura LegendHU: kenwood Double din
5,Was floored at the quality for the price,Picked these up half-off on Amazon 2 weeks ago. Having installed polk DB series in all my past cars I am usually very picky. Being on a very tight budget and needing to replace my speakers quick I picked these up and WOW i have to say for 11 dollar speakers they are VERY good. Running of a Sony headunit they are way way better than I have expected.360-watt???? I call BS on that claim but with 35 watts a channel through them (4 installed) they kick really good and have OK bass. (Nothing CLOSE to a subwoofer but just enough if loud enoguh to shake my rearview a bit and shake my side mirrors).Will buy again and again. About 75% as good as my old Polk DB series for a FRACTION of a FRACTION of the cost. $110vs$11!!!! That is a a HUGGGEE Difference.
2,Won't fit my Car,These speakers were supposed to fit my Car but they didn't. They were just too thick. I sent them back and got some Pioneer speakers that fit perfectly.
1,very displeased,Do not waste your money on these speakers. Bought them for an old car I was bringing back to life and found one of the speakers did not even work. Save your money
4,Good Sound,"Wasnt really expecting much from these speakers, then again i didnt know anything about Pyle, to my suprise these cheap little speakers put out some decent sound used them to replace my two front dashboard speakers and couldnt be more happy."
4,Oustanding Value,"I purchased 2 sets of PL-63BL speakers. These speakers deliver an outstanding price/performance value. A little bright/tinny in the highs, but a reduction in treble takes care of that, and saves a few watts. The bass is lacking and a subwoofer is definitely welcome to help pick up the bottom 2 octaves. Overall, as replacements for OEM speakers, you cannot go wrong. I would highly recommend the Pyle PL-63BL speakers to those on a budget."
5,Great speaker for the price.,I bought 2 pair of these for my daughter's Civic and they were fairly hefty and well built. Put them in along with a JVC receiver. The sound was good for the price with decent bass and crisp highs. Can't beat them for the price so I gave them the 5 star rating based on the value.
4,Good Replacement Speakers,"Bought these to replace the two speakers in my car that blew out. For the price, they are great speakers. Not as loud as my stock speakers were, but that could also be the amp in my car. If you're looking at these to replace perfectly good speakers, save your money and buy something higher and with more power."
4,sounds great for the money,Its not the best speakers i ever had but they where cheap and i just wanted to replace the speakers in my wifes 2004 civic.it doesnt have much bass but great highs and mids.
3,Meh,"These speakers are OK. They are overrated power wise. I had them running on 60 watts a piece and i blew one of them. IF you are just hooking them up to a head unit, you'll be fine. Don't push much bass, but if you want bass buy a sub."
1,"Terrible, beware of these.","I took my chances with these speakers, and they worked for 3 days. All week I had my stereo at Volume 14, and just this past weekend I went 4 wheeling with my friends and cranked up some dubstep to volume 18 (my stereo goes to 50) and the driver side speaker blew out. I also got the 5.25 inch Pyle Speakers and I give those 2 stars, only because they haven't blown out yet, they don't sound very good. I returned both sets and sacrificed 3 days of no speakers in my car to get some Polk Audio Speakers. Spend the extra money and get some better quality speakers."
3,should've bought better,"I wish I would've bought something better, these are OK but the old ones were better. So I paid to downgrade."
3,"Pyle 6.5"" Auto Speakers","Was looking for something cheap to replace my factory speaker in my work truck. Sound good with the minimum expense, aftermarket stereo system. Would probably sound better with a better system pushing them."
2,Eh...,360 watt max my a**! They were sounding distorted even by the 50 watt max head unit. Took way too long to ship.
3,Ok for the price,"These are okay for the price. Like a lower end stock speaker. Does the job and has decent sound except the bass. The bass is just terrible on these. If you enjoy listening to louder dance music and hip hop, these are not for you."
4,"6.5"" speaker review","I needed a decent but not exorbitantly priced pair of round speakers to fit in the shallow door spaces of my Land Rover 110 Station Wagon, and the Pyle speakers fit & work just fine. For those who wish over-amplified sound they'd best go with more powerful speakers (but due to bigger magnets would not fit in a shallow space, mine being just over an inch deep). I also fitted spacer rings that gave another 1/2"" of depth, just right. Nice for vocal & classical music. The 6 x 9 speakers in the rear are just enough for good sound, at reasonable levels."
4,sounds good,"So far so good for the money spent. Just running off stock head unit, but sounds well enough. Have to wait and see with putting them on an amp"
4,Did the job.....,"Ordered these speakers to replace door speakers in my 2001 Impala. Fit like a glove. Had to clip plastic guides on door housing, to get flush fit. Speaker is not as good as what was in my car, so I left the passanger speaker as is. Replaced driver speaker (as blown). When all 4 are pumping, sounds great. Good replacement speaker, and at 20 bucks, how can you complain. Very satisfied."
1,PYLE of S**T,"Installed them in the front doors of my 2004 cavalier running off a cheap pioneer deck. The fit was good so I give them that. Initial sound was decent at best, the sound is pretty dry. Here come the issues, on the 4th day of running these speakers one of them developed a slight rattle. I figured the speaker had just come loose and planned on fixing it when I got home. The rattling got progressively worse and the speaker output suffered greatly. By the time I got home from a 20min. drive the speaker was dead. I guess you get what you pay for time to buy some pioneer or infinity speakers."
3,you get what you pay for,pyle? yea pyle of sh*#. ok yes its an upgrade from the stock speakers but you get some heavy feedback when the volume is up and the bass is non existant. Trust me spend the extra money and get a kicker or another name brand.
5,Great Speakers,"Don't be fooled by the low price. I thought I would purchase these speakers to replace some stock speakers in my truck. I really didn't think they would sound as good as they do, but I did..they are not to blow your ears away but they produce a clear sound."
1,A Pyle,These speakers are garbage and sound terrible. The highs and mid range sound distorted and something like a badly tuned radio station. The base is non-existent. The wattage rating should be divided by at least 100 to get the true rating. Great price.
4,Better than stock,Replaced my stock speakers with these because they said they would fit.....which they did not but after some serious drilling & cutting they sound decent for the price. Decent size magnets & cone has good seal the metal housing assembly is painted !!!!!MADE IN CHINA!!!!!!
4,Decent sound,"The speakers are a low price replacement alternative. The sound is okay an for the price your not going to find speakers that sound this well, Again at this price. The speakers do lack base as well lack crystal clear sound but they are loud an sound ok. Anyone who bash these speakers don't have a clue what they are talking about. They are expecting $200 sound for $20 an that's not going to happen.Install was easy on my Durango using the clips an screws provided, just need to know what ur doing."
5,Nothing fancy - Does the job,"Like the title states: Nothing fancy or superb here, just a basic set of speakers. Nice composition, style and build of quality, just not sure if they could take any amount of an amp beyond a simple 100 watts at the most... Overall, good simple sound but realistically no bass to be noticeable here.Kudos to Amazon.com! Came in super fast!! Thank you Amazon."
4,Decent sound,I replaced the Infinity Gold speaker in my '97 Jeep with these. They more than met my expectations of what a $25 per pair speaker should be.
4,Perfect for the money,"For what your paying, your getting a good set of speakers. Of course sound quality could be better if you went out and spent a couple hundred dollars but obviously if your looking at these your not wanting to spend that much. Only thing misleading is the speakers I received, and I don't know if there all like this, but they weren't blue like in the picture they were a very dark blue. Shipping was fast, I opted for standard and recieved them two days ahead if estimated Delivery. I would recommend these to anyone wanting good sound at a good price."
4,Great speakers for the price but beware fitment guide,"These speakers do sound great for the money.However, they do NOT fit the doors of 1994-1996 Ford F-Series trucks without completely cutting out the holes and drilling all new mounting screw holes. The fitment guide said they would fit - but it should add ""with major metalwork modifications."" I mean, if any amount of modification is allowed then why bother, any speaker will fit any car."
3,Okay for the price,"These speakers are decent but can handle much bass at all. ive decided to sell them and look for something that can at least handle something closer to 50Hz or less. I have to turn down the bass to play them so they dont distort, which also means less bass to my sub... sooo im reconsidering. how ever the mid to high range is decent so if your not playing bass demanding tracks they may be worth it for you to buy"
2,Not great,"Although the speakers are clear, they are very weak sounding with very low bass. My stock (paper) speakers sounded much louder."
5,Replacement of front doors Chevy Tahoe,"These are very attractive speakers, not sure why case, can't see em when installed but they are pretty! Bolt in to the front doors of my GM/Chevy Tahoe to replace failed OEM, these are great fitment. The sound reproduction is satisfactory with highs and mids that breathed new life into the stock system at a very reasonable price. They are solidly constructed (seemed better than the GM speakers) and come with all necessary hardware, grilles, wiring etc. Spliced into my existing wiring, screwed em in. The hardest part of the job is removal of the door covers (which isn't hard at all).Recommend these as frugal replacement with very reasonable sound."
5,Excellent value,"I purchased these speakers for a 2002 Chevy Cavalier. After watching a few YouTube videos, I was worried that I may need to recut the existing template to install them but these fit the factory speaker perfectly. Install was a breeze. I disconnected the existing connections and soldered them to the new speakers. The whole process took about 30 minutes.The speakers sound great! They don't blow your ears back or anything and I had low expectations for the $20 I paid for the pair. They exceeded my expectations by a lot. Great product!"
3,"Better than a Blown-Out speaker, but not premium quality","Bought to replace two blown-out OEM speakers in our 24-passenger bus, since the Afghani contractors don't consider speakers to be an important item to repair.The sound is limp, and one has a little buzz/goes out on hard turns, but being able to hear AFN is a real morale booster.Can't go wrong at ~[...] bucks for two speakers. No complaints, but no awards either."
1,KEEP YOUR METAL AWAY FROM THESE SPEAKERS,"Didn't expect much for $24 to the door, but 1 of the 2 4"" speakers were easily blown with no amp direct to head unit. Volume was not cranked by any means, but these squeakers cant handle. Fail..dont waste your hooters wings n beer money."
1,it's not doing anything,"I had read every review online here. Mostly all good review, but I dont think this is a great product. If you are going for good sounds, pls DO NOT get this item. This item will not do it for your need. It's too soft and not loud enough."
1,dont buy these,I would not buy these speakers ever again had them for less than a week and they blew and sound like crap waste of money
4,good speakers at a good price,"All in all, good speakers for the price. Missing a little low end bass but everything else is great. Shipped fast."
4,Not a Bad up grade,"I just Installed these speakers in my 94 S-10 Blazer in 30 min and have to say they sound good. I replaced the rear door speakers. The Highs and Mids sound good, Not a lot of Bass but it does the job. I would recommend these speakers to anyone who is looking to upgrade from stock and don't want to spend a whole lot of money. I would say these are 1-2 steps up from stock."
1,defective product,"good day, i recently purchased this item[...], when i recieved it and upon opening the speaker box with the speakers inside, i found that the rubber surrounding the speakers was broken to pieces, that's the rubber to reinforce the speaker and both NOT working, after paying the price, freight,duties and taxes, this just wasted my MONEY... very BAD product and MISLEADING company.."
4,"Great for price, but doesn't fit without some help","Sounds great. For <$10 for the pair, much better than the stock speakers of my 2000 Honda Accord SE. HOWEVER, even though this was supposed to fit my car, it does not. The speakers do not fit the harness in any way, and had to shell out another $20 for the spacer AND had to dremel the door to make everything fit. I guess I should have done more research, but had I known, I would have spent an extra $20 on the speakers themselves that actually fit my car; hence the 4 star."
5,great speakers for the price!,Put these in an 03 Silverado and they sound much better than the stock speakers. Good speakers at a great price and they fit perfectly!
4,Speakers for my Trailblazer,"Bought these as replacement for factory speakers in '07 Trailblazer. Turns out that even though the description says they are a fit, we had to modify the openings so we could install them. That added about an hour to the install. Also, when new they didn't appear to have a lot of volume but as I used them, they played louder and the sound is excellent, better than original. Overall, excellent value for the money."
4,Cheap but decient speakers,"I bought these for a 2003 honda goldwing. They fit fine other than they are smaller than OE so I had to slot the mounting ears to get the screw to hold them in. Installed with the factory radio they aren't any better than the OEM speakers. But I put a Sony 4XMS amp on these and they really do shine. Can't handle much bass but what do you expect from a 4"" speaker. I can hear my tunes loud and clear at 70mph now. For the price you can't beat it. Probably will change out for Polk 5"" speakers in the future though. The mounting tabs feel a little too thin."
4,Good Speakers especially for those of us on a budget,"These are really nice speakers that produce good sound in all ranges low, medium, high. I bought these and the 6"" x 9"" Pyles and it really brought the sound back in a old school buick roadmaster. I havn't had them long and have nothing other than a JVC head unit pushing them. I dont know if they can handle a Amp or not I am sure the 6""x9""s can they are rated at 280 watts at 4ohm. Good buy if your on a budget very reasonably priced and it only took a few days to arrive."
2,good speakers.....for awhile.,Got a pair of these speakers and there fantastic in my single cab truck. Definitely recommend. I will buy more products from these guys. Im adding to this now because these speakers fell apart on me. Ive never touched after installation. I began to notice 2 weeks ago the sound started fading and sounded scratchy. I took them out and saw that the blue part was falling apart....it was brittle. Not sure how this accrues with speakers. If it does they should've lasted longer.
3,Nie sound,They got to me pretty quickly and while installing them in my 01 cavalier i found that they are slightly too small to fit into the stock bracket. All you have to do is bolt it on there and it will bend into place.After 3 weeks of owning them im noticing that they both have a really bad thumping which i think means there going to blow soon so that means i gotta take them out and send them back in to get a new pairOver all its a good product just wish i didn't have to go through the process of taking them out and putting them back in once they get here
4,Great replacement speakers!,"I had some old speaker boxes that needed some replacement speakers, these Pyle speakers were a perfect fit and make some useless wooden boxes into some mighty fine new speakers for my workspace!"
4,Great Deal for the Money $$$$$,"Bought both the 4"" & the 6.5"" and I have to say, pretty darn good. A keen ear might pick up where they come short but I couldn't. Bass, highs and the mid-range were all ""acceptable"". You really can't beat these guys for about $38.00 you get 4 speakers, (2-6.5 tri-ax & 2-4"" 2 ways).With a cheapo radio from Pioneer, they sounded great. Shipping was also on the money. Items arrived 8:30 AM on the 1st day promised. I had 'em up & running by 9:30. Shipping Company is called Lasership which I didn't know who the heck that was but, they were right on time. They are an independent shipping Company with independent drivers."
2,No Bass And Does Not Fit Acura Integra 92,"I dislike a lot of bass in my car, will never install a sub-woofer and you will never be able to hear the bass from the music I listen to outside my car, but even I was dissapointed with the lack of bass from these speakers. You can compare them with any factory speakers and note the lack of bass frequencies. If you don't have other speakers with average bass in your car - do not buy these speakers.Also, Amazon says these speakers fit in an Acura Integra 92 but they do not. They are about 10 millimeters too large to fit inside the speaker wells. I had to screw them into the top of the speaker wells which is not good because they will eventually vibrate when the screws get loose over time - not a big deal to me since it is an old car.Other than the lack of bass and not really fitting in my car, these are very affordable speakers to replace blown speakers if you don't mind kick drums sounding like toms."
2,1 blown in 4 mo,"Good buy, thought I couldn't go wrong, sound ok, too much treble, and one blew out in four months, with a stereo not even pushing the speakers max wattage. I would not purchase again."
2,Too cheap!!! You get what you paid for!!,"I gave it a two because the package arrived very fast, but the speakers material are cheap, the sound is awfull. I have a 2003 Matrix and the factory speaker is a lot more better than this one, that's why I requested a refund. If you have a car that was made in 70 - 96 than I guess is worth to do an upgrade with these speakers, if not then belive me your better of saving those $20 for a better speakers."
4,They work great for the price.,These speakers work great for the price. I installed them myself in my wife 2004 Honda Civic. it worked better then the stock speakers and it only took like 40 mins to hook them up.that was including taking out the rear panel to the car and the front doors panels. They do have some bass but it wont shake your car but if you want that then get some subwoofers with it like i did and they get the JOB DONE.
3,Stock grade at most,"I installed these in my '95 Corolla with a new head unit which is nearly identical to the head unit in my friend's '96 Camry with stock speakers. His car's sound out-performed mine with his stock speakers when I had a comparable head unit and these speakers on the back deck with their little brother 4"" ones in my doors. If you listen to talk radio/ books on tape then these are perfect; they do the job without breaking the bank. If you're looking for a speaker that is even the slightest bit more powerful than your non blown-out stock speakers, look elsewhere."
3,Just needed a small improvement,"Just needed an ""okay"" upgrade in my speakers before installation of my subwoofer. For the price these 3-ways do the job. Bass is okay but sound is loud and clear! These speakers fit in my dodge neon but had to have new holes drilled."
2,Sounded great for a week,"Installed without issue. I was replacing some Sony Xplod speakers that had become physically damaged. Connected to a 200W JVC head unit. They sounded really great for about a week, then they blew. Awful speakers. Very disappointed."
4,Pyle PL63BL 6.5-Inch,Pyle PL63BL 6.5-Inch nice looking speakers they would not fit my 97 honda civic front doors magnet too large speaker terminals too far to the outside outer ring would not line up with existing holes trim would not cover ring still a nice product just not for the civic
4,"Nice sound, but shade them from sun!","I have worn out 2 pairs of these speakers- not from blowing them out with amplifier, but from the sun! Make sure you have some sun protection from them if they are in the rear deck, as the sun deteriorates the cone pretty quickly. My car lives in FL, and even with decent tint they crumbled. For the price and sound quality, however, they are great speakers!"
3,plain speakers...,I bought these Pyle speakers about 3 weeks ago received them pretty quickly (a week) and just recently installed them myself. I have a 99 corolla and the stock speakers were pretty decent but I wanted a bigger thumb on it so I purchased theses thinking it will be a bit louder I was wrong sounds pretty much the same. Basically if your look for some plain speakers to replace your stock speakers then purchase these but not much of a performance up grade.
2,Weak & dont fit Honda Civic,"These do NOT fit in a 1999 Honda Civic Sedan front doors.You will have to cut about 1/4"" off the outer metal and make new holes. Not Pyles fualt.Installed with a 22wx4 RMS head unit, and the sound is weak.They quidkly distort when turned to semi-loud volume levels. A average volums, they are OK.I paired these whith Pyle 6x9's in the back. They rears sound decent.Perhaps I need more power, or my car acustics are sorry, but I'm not impressed at all."
2,tweeters blew after 2 months,"these speakers were powered by a stock honda radio, so too much power was not the issue... not recommended by me."
3,"Cheap, but if you like bass, think twice","No one will argue that these speakers are cheap, but you get what you pay for. They are actually quite good on the highs and mid-range and if that's all you need (ie. if you have a seperate sub-woofer or don't listen to music with much bass) then you can't beat the value. But trust me, if you listen to music with any significant amount of bass these speakers will start to distort at mid-volume level and just sound bad any louder than that. I checked the tech specs. and found the frequency response only goes down to about 90Hz vs other higher-end speakers which generally go down to 30-50Hz."
1,.....Not So Good.....,"I bought 2 pair of these speakers. The first pair had one speaker that had no bass. The driver was defective or something. The second pair, neither speaker had any bass, both were defective. I got my money refunded (thank's Amazon!), and bought Kenwoods instead, no problems. I think Pyle's quality control in China must have had a day off when these speakers were made. Hard to believe 3 out of the 4 speakers were defective for the same reason......Amazon handled the transaction very well, had the speakers in 2 days, and refunded my money in just a couple after receiving the defective units back Great service as usual!"
4,great for the money.,I have a 2 thousand dollar system and when my door pods blow I bought these to put in until I got the money for some new 6.5 mids.I think I am going to keep them.They dont pound the bass but they can handle 50 watts darn good.All in all a great door speaker if you have a componant system and dont need them for all the sound.
2,Good sound; don't fit '94 Legacy wagon rear deck,"Hoped to replace blown-out Dual XP65i rear speakers in my '94 Subaru Legacy wagon with some $25-30 speakers, but the frame is too deep for the rear deck and don't fit flush; they stick up ~1/2"" (:-(Will continue to look for proper replacement (being much more skeptical of compatibility charts; a fine example of something best purchased from a local store but, alas, my nearby stores only offer $100+ speakers.)The Pyles do sound pretty good, though."
2,cheeeeeeeep,"These speakers are inexpensive, but also cheap.They sound OK now, but long-term? Within a week of installing them, the metal grills had separated from the plastic bracket, with the ""glue"" that originally bound them oozing out as a black goo. I re-attached them with super-glue. Shoddy design in one area may spread...A piezo tweeter? That's nothing to brag about, it's the sign of cutting costs; frequency response is inferior to a similar size conventional design.I had 16 dollars, and I thought, ""maybe I should throw this money in the street. What, I can get new car speakers for 16 dollars? OK."" They sound fine for 16 dollars, but I have no illusions about longevity or ""intended quality."""
1,Major let down,"These were simply the most underwhelming speakers I have ever heard. I know the price should've tipped me off but I used to purchase pyle amps and subs back in the day and was the envy of the area when I cranked up the sound system in the firebird, I thought a product that had the Pyle name would perform adequately at worst. Stay away from these speakers, the other functioning factory 5.25 speaker still in my 98 monte carlo sounds much better than these speakers."
2,lied to,I paid to recieve my stuff in 2 days which would have been 4/14/2012 and here it is 4/15/12 and no package yet
3,JUNK,DONT WAST YOUR TIME BUY JVC OR PIONEER OR SONY OR ROCKFORD FOSGATE or anything besides these they were so bad i sold the car and got a truck and now i have a JVC headunit RF speakers and a Kenwood Mini SUB AMP! Now i am jamming out with my clam out!THEY CALL IT PYLE FOR A REASON............. PYLE OF SH!7
2,One of them blew within a day.,"I bough these with no expectation of them being high quality speakers. They were just something to replace by tired old stock speakers in my '97 Wrangler. However, after only one day (and no more than 3/4 volume from the stock radio) on of them developed a noticeable crackle. I guess I'm not surprised, maybe I even broke it putting it in (doubt it). But, in the long run I'd say you usually always better off spending a bit more to get something better...someday I'll learn."
1,"Sounded ok for the money, but...","Naturally, I did not have high expecations for these inexpensive speakers. I just wanted to replace the dead units from my old Accord. They actually sounded and looked reasonable, so I was satisfied. 9 months later, both speakers developed cracks in the poly speaker cones, which quickly split and basically fell apart. Now they are in my garbage can. I can only assume this is from sitting in the sun? Sitting the back window of a car, the sun is difficult to avoid. I never played them very loud, so I am at a loss. Save your money."
3,can't handle the bass,"I bought these speakers because they had great reviews, the sound is okay on low volume, the bass reproduction is poor.These speakers actually sound worse then the factory speakers. There is no way these speaker can handle 360 watts as listed.These speakers are okay if you don't like to turn up the volume."
2,Where's the bass?,I had a the left front speaker that had busted in a 97 geo prizm. I got these to replace both my front speakers. I installed the busted speaker 1st and tested it. With the rear speakers turned off I switched from left to right on the front speakers. The 15 year old factory speaker was twice as loud and had a lot more bass. I ended up only replacing the busted speaker and leaving the other factory speaker. I would compare the sound quality a notch above a clock radio. The good news is that I don't have to listen to that busted speaker rattling:-)
2,No significant improvement over OEM original equipment,Couldn't tell any sound difference between these and the original Chinese speakers in my K1500. The good part about the originals is they lasted many years while one of the Pyles failed in a couple of months. I had low expectations that anything resembling good sound could come out of a 4 x 6 speaker. At least it didn't cost much to find out I was right.
4,great speakers,"i got them about two months ago go in love them sound is so crisp an the only problems is the bass for them . but i have 12"" kenwood subwoofers in the back so i was""t too worried about the bass easy to install and a long speaker wire too connect them too."
1,Not so great.,Piece of crap cannot play music with any bass at all. I didn't get them for bass but they keep cracking. If I go above medium volume.
3,A fair value,"The price is right on these. They do the basic job of a wrist wrap, but the elastic band used to tighten them is too narrow to be comfortable."
3,Just fine for a beginner,"I'm entering my third year of Russian study, and I am becoming frustrated with this dictionary. It is the only one I used the first two years, and it served me well during that time. The small size is convenient, and the grammar tables in the back have been invaluable. However, I have found (especially in the English to Russian section) many inaccuracies, and the Russian to English section lacks many words that are necessary--even fairly basic ones. If you want a good jumping-off point, this will suffice, but pretty soon you would be better off buying a reference grammar and a more complete dictionary."
5,The Most Convenient Dictionary,This is the best pocket dictionary I could recommend. The dictionary provides RELIABLE translations from both English and Russian languages. Overwhelming majority of non-professional words may be found in the dictionary in spite of its size.
5,STOP AND READ THIS!!!,"Don't bother with other drills. I have tried them all(Dewalt, Makita, Hitachi, Craftsman, Ridgid, and Bosch). I have had my 18v hammer drill for over 1 1/2 yrs and my batteries are still as good as the day I bought them and I use it EVERYDAY!One day I showed my electrican how good it was by using a 2"" self-feed bit through a bottom plate and subfloor in one of my houses i'm building. He told me there was no way a cordless could do that. (NOTE: you have to do this in LOW RANGE as i did)After showing him this his crew now has five panasonic drills with 15.6 and 18vs. I aslo have a 15.6v drill and it is a better drill than other brands that are 18v. These drills are second to NONE."
2,"Sorry, not impressed as the others","With all the high five's given this product, I feel like the odd man out with my opinion. But anyway, here goes. I purchased this drill solely on the advise of a Consumer Reports article that gave it very high marks. I was very impressed with it's torque and the length of time the batteries held up to heavy use. However, after 6 months the motor flamed out (it actually started smoking) and I had to have it repaired. Panasonic made me jump through a lot of hoops, but I finally got it repaired under the warranty. It was not a good experience. One year later, the trigger switch broke and it cost me $75 plus shipping to have it fixed. One year later, the batteries have now gone bad. Neither will accept a charge. I'm now trying to rationalize buying new batteries for a drill that may well need more repairs."
4,That truthful friend,"In this book, Pat is like that one friend who tells you when your butt does look bad in those jeans. Pat tells it like it is, so you better be prepared for a lot of hard-to-hear truth. But you'll be thankful later, when your published."
4,Good Advice for Writers,"As someone who has been publishing short stories in small circulation magazines for years, I thought I might pick up this book and see if there was any advice I hadn't picked up along the way in my own publishing endeavors. I have to say that Mr. Walsh hits the proverbial nail on the head when it comes to advice for new writers who are trying to break into the publishing game. He gets right to the point and doesn't try to pretend that writing or publishing are easy in any way (which they aren't). He will probably come off as mean to those who refuse to revise their work or play by the rules that govern publishing, I think he's really just one of those people who tells it like it is.I'd like to see a revised edition of this book that deals with the proliferation of e-readers and instant electronic publishing that's taking the literary world by storm these days, though much of the advice Mr. Walsh offers still pertains."
4,A Funny Take on the Publishing Industry,"I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud at a book. I certainly didn't expect to get my first good guffaw in years from a book on writing. But if anything, author and editor Pat Walsh specializes in the out-of-the-ordinary. Not only does Walsh offer great insider tips to writers, he does so with humor, self-deprecation, and experience.While there isn't a ton of new material here (most experienced writers already know not to use glittery paper and heart stickers when submitting their manuscripts), it's always good to be reminded that there are real people behind the form letters sent out with such abandon.I can't say I have changed anything about the way I'm writing and submitting my novel, but I did enjoy Walsh's writing, and finished the book with a renewed determination to make it out of the slush pile."
5,Blunt and funny,"Walsh won't teach you how to write. He won't give you examples of ""the perfect query letter."" But he does lay it out honestly and brutally. It's easy to get pissed at him -- hell, if you HAVE written a cross between The Hunt for Red October and Beowulf, he can be downright insulting. But if you've ever had true, honest critique of your work, it gives you a feeling this book gave me.And for those of you who don't like it, I read it in the bookstore for free. I AM a starving writer after all!"
1,DOG IN A MANGER.,"At the beginning Walsh reveals he failed as a writer, then spends the rest of the book dissing writers. Walsh is the dog in a manger.There's nuthin in this book that helps you prevail upon the problems Walsh illustrates. He makes it clear editors and publishers dont wanna deal with you at all, and the real gate-keepers are the least experienced junior staffers at the publishing houses who sample the slush pile when forced.The book is an I'M OKAY, YOURE NOT OKAY rant."
2,Repetitive. Repetitive.,"Same points drilled over and over again.Seems to be written by a very angry, anal retentive, frustrated writer full of piss and vinegar.I am glad I am not a professional writer if the industry is filled with folks like this.Book could have been half as long and should have been half the price."
3,Very disappointing,"I own a book fair company and saw the video stream of the awards ceremony this morning. I was waiting with bated breath, because there were so many memorable books I had read this past year. Keeper, Seven Wonders of Sassafrass Springs and Listening for Lions. Criss Cross was not one of them. After the winner was announced, I found the advanced reading copy in one of my 'piles', and sat down to read it again. It was sitting in my ""Wait for Paperback"" pile. I'll admit that Perkins writes poetically, even beautifully. However, the dialog was contrived, the streaming images got old after a while and when I put the book down, I could do so without giving it another thought! As far as I am concerned, the ALA has passed over the best in children's literature, time and again. (Milkweed, Ruby Holler, Stargirl) This year is no different. Perhaps the only nails they've hit on the head in past years have been House of the Scorpion and Single Shard.Disappointed again,"
3,Criss Cross,"I think the book I am reviewing, Criss Cross is a three star rating because I can't picture what the main characters(Debbie, and Hector) look like. For me to read a book, I love to picture the characters, but not make up my own. I could tell what their personalities were, but it bugs me a lot, that their was no description of what they looked like.The first half of the book was slow moving. Not a lot was happening, and it was not very interesting untill almost the end of the story.A Newbery Award book has to be 1)interesting,2) creative,3) or both. I think Criss Cross is not very interesting, and is somewhat creative.If you ask me who I relate to in this story,it would have to be Debbie, she is adventurous, and so am I, in a way.The conflict is fuzzy to me because you can't really tell when it happened, and when the book ended I thought ""really? It ended?"" I didn't find it worthy of the medal because the book didn't draw me in."
5,Delightful!,"I enjoyed this book immensely. The characters are brilliantly yet subtly drawn, and Ms. Perkins manages to fully develop them deftly and succinctly, as in the best short stories. A sense of the pasts and futures of these kids is magically infused into the brief glimpses we get of them. I highly recommend this book to adults as well as advanced kids. Those who gave this book a one-star review (after not finishing it?!) have really short-changed themselves; I fear that their ears are beginning to elongate and they may soon be making braying sounds, but perhaps they could begin to read less shallowly and reverse the process."
3,Average Juvenile Fiction,"""Criss Crossed"" is a story the coming of age of two teenagers in a modern world. Unfortunately, so is every other juvenile fiction story. The only redeeming qualities is that nothing terrible happens in the story, and once in a while there is an interesting phrase.Ms. Perkins is a word-smith who uses lots of colorful language, but her overuse of word pictures detracts from rather than adds to the story. Most teenagers would have to read this book with a dictionary in hand. I have read all but three Newbery books, and this one is entirely forgetable.It would be better if children chose the Newberys instead of adults. Then maybe some interesting titles would emerge."
1,Double Crossed by Criss Cross,"I purchased this book because it was a Newberry winner. It was to be a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter. I decided to read it. It's awful! This book was given an award by grown-ups, for grown-ups. As a librarian and a widely read person, I could not imagine why this book got a medal. It was boring. The only chpater worth reading was the one about trying on the jeans. What a disappointment. I got her another present, and we will donate it to our library. On the other hand, rather than deceive people, maybe we should just discard it."
2,It Doesn't Deserve the Medal,"""Criss Cross"" by Lynne Rae Perkins is somewhat of a sequel to her debut novel, ""All Alone in the Universe."" Criss Cross is about kids living in the 70's who are fourteen. It's just about them living there lives, going through things every normal teen goes through. The problem with Criss Cross is that it doesn't go anywhere, just kinda wanders around on the surface of plotlines. When it does go a little deeper, it pulls itself up out onto the surface, and the storylines are forgotten within the next few chapters. The book is alright, but it didn't deserve the Newbery Medal, which should of went to ""Day of Tears."" If you want to read something by Mrs. Perkins, read ""All Alone in the Universe"" which is better and has a point."
5,Great Book-It won the Newbery! A really amazing peice of writing.,I thought this was a great book. Im in seventh grade but I read this in forth grade. I dont know why some of the reviews are so bad for this book. I really loved it and it was not boring. The rest of you must not appreciate good literature.
1,Newbery Award?,"It is hard to believe a written version of what could be a pre to early teen ""Reality"" TV show has won this prestigious award for literary excellence. Other reviews call this a ""very believable plot,"" and it is if that is what you want to call an average day to day existence in the lives of those characters. But where is the ""phenomenal"" work that qualifies it for such an award? It is slow moving, boring and lacks anything other than an average ""coming of age"" plot."
1,hoping for something,"That's exactly what I was doing with this book. Hoping for something to happen. I finished the book and asked myself WHAT WAS THE PLOT? Then I realized there wasn't one. Sadly enough, I think it was a poor choice for a Newberry Award winner....."
1,Newbery Winner?,"I just finished Criss Cross by Lynn Rae Perkins and must say, I am completely confused as to how this book won the Newbery. Similar to another review, I almost gave up half-way through, but thought, 'it's a Newbery winner, something's got to happen soon!' So I forged ahead...and nope, nothing happens.I don't claim to know a lot about writing, but I enjoy reading and usually love the Newbery winners. But this was an unbelievable disappointment and can't believe I spent more than an hour trying to find meaning in the choppy text and heart in the surfacy plots."
3,"pleasant, but not especially interesting","This book was pleasant, however the characters were quite ordinary, and I did find some parts so boring I just had to skip them to get through it. I saw no great depth of character or special insight anywhere. I suspect this would mostly be enjoyable if there's a nostalgia factor (if you were an teen of average popularity in the early 70's, then you might well like it.) There was some humor that might have tickled me if I'd been in the right mood for it, but apparently I wasn't. My daughters read this as part of a 'Mock Newberry' club they were in (the members, age 11 - 13, read and discussed Newberry candidates.) My girls found it boring, and it was not especially popular among the children."
1,Don't read this!,"I had to read this book for my school and decide whether or not they should by it, and if I didn't have to review the book I wouldn't have read past the tenth page.Supposedly the story is about Debbie's locket getting lost and being passed to various people, but that idea is so poorly expressed it might as well have been never mentioned at all.The rule about coming of age books, which this is supposed to be, is that by the end of the book the characters have grown or learned something. But that doesn't happen here! I'm surprised this was ever published. When a person reads a book the want to hear about something interesting, not hear about the everyday lives of people who do nothing, over and over again.I've never read the book All Alone in the Universe, and maybe it's better, but judging from Criss Cross I wouldn't advise anyone to read this."
2,Has any kid read this book?,I think this is the type of book that people would like to think kids are reading--cutesy with long descriptions and a hint of serious stuff (pp. 88-90). Maybe during the 1950s?
3,Good book!,"This books was good, but not one of those ""I can't put it down"" stories. I kept reading because I did want to know what happened to the characters, but I felt it was very poorly written. Stuff was included that was irrelevant to the plot. And I thought it was very interesting (is that the word) that a 14 year old had access to tobacco and his friends did not even try to help him stop. The last chapter was great, but you have to read the whole book to get there."
4,Criss Cross,"Criss Cross by Lenna Rae Perkins is a Newbery Award winnig book. i think that I really liked this book because it had a lot to do with friends and since i'm a social person then it was the right book for me. I rated this book a our because it had very good details as i was expexting from the author. i would recommened that you read this book if you're really patient with waiting on for the climax of the story to happen. it ahs a lot of great personalities mixed in with the characters. i thik that they all formed together to make the book really interesting. my favorite character of the book would have to be Jenny. Ithink that she was the best character out of all of the characters in the book. so if you have the patience to read a book and you're not worried about getting to the end, then i think that you'll have good time with it. R.Copeland"
1,Boring and disjointed,This book was so uninteresting and disjointed I could not make myself finish it. I have no idea why it won the Newberry.
1,When does Debbie lose the Necklace?,"I am reading this book because it is on my daughters summer reading list. She threw it down frustrated and said it was stupid. I told her it couldn't be the book, it must be her attitude and that I'd read it and then help her understand it. Well, I don't understand it. I came here to read reviews in hopes of gaining understanding. Can someone tell me when Debbie loses her necklace? In the first chapter, I see where it falls but she gets it back. I see where other people find it but I just don't see where she loses it. My daughter is supposed to define a problem, important events and the solution. I haven't read anything terribly problematic yet. Anyway, just looking for help on this one."
1,Criss Cross kcs,"this book is about a 14 year old girl named Debbie who wishes something great woud happen to her. Her other friend Hector who is aware of things around him tells the story in his point of view. In the begining of this story, Debbie loses her neckllace and is passed to differn't characters in this story. Lyne Rae Perkins fills this exciting book with differn't types of questions, poems, haiku, and pictures to get the reader flowing with this book."
1,And the point is....?,"-snore- Wha? Ah yes, this book. Where shall I begin? Well let's look at the pros and cons for a second, shall we?Pros+ Erm, none at the momentCons+ There was no point to this book+ The characters were so alike I had no idea who each one was+ Each charrie didn't even have a personality+ It was BORING!+ There was no humor, it was all an overhard attempt to be even mildly funny...sigh..."
1,Not Impressed,"In my opinion, this book is dry and lacks a purpose or a message. There isn't much to the telling, and seems forsed in some areas. It was confusing in parts, and extraordinarily dull in others. I wouldn't reccomend it, but every book deserves a fair try. Perhaps youngers readers might enjoy it more, but I doubt it. It was not very good, and doesn't live up to the Newberry Title it hase been granted."
4,Dreamkeeper; It's a keeper!,"Wonderful & beautifully done! Enjoyed with my entire family, and we plan to watch it again & again!! Excellent storyline, nice bridge of the ancient & the modern, and exceptional portrayal of what generations of Native Americans face as they seek to define themselves, rather than be defined by non-Native preconceptions."
5,Beautifully spiritual film,"Wow, I was blown away after watching this beautiful film. I loved it. It was profound, entrancing, captivating, fascinating and emotionally moving. I felt its spiritual connection, even though I am a white city girl - a far cry from Native American culture! Still, I appreciate good story-telling and this movie tells many of them. It is also to be commended for documenting these fabulous stories before they are lost forever. I had to buy it to watch again and to lend to my enlightened friends. Thoroughly recommended."
5,good lessons,It really had a great lesson in teaching patience with the youth of today and how important it is to reach out and show them a better way and how to problem solve.
5,Awsome story,"I originally saw this movie several years ago. It really stuck with me, but, I couldn't remember the title. I thought it was great how it applied native stories to real life situations of today. It definatly made one stop and think. It made me laugh and cry, sometimes at the same time. I forgot how long it was but it kind of draws you in and you HAVE to know whats going to happen next. Great movie."
5,from my heart- the real world of my people,I am an East Coast Indian and all i can say is Thank you from my heart for making this movie about all my people and our culture.Thank you Amazon. com for offering this for sale but i do disagree about the movie not holding together. I can not watch this movie enough. It has alot of life messages that it tells. It is about real- our Indian world. The natural world.I cry with proudness when i see Indians acting as Indians. Our true world-our true culture was shown in this movie. My heart is Proud.........This movie will be seen and handed down in our families for time to come........
5,good medicine,"its really hard to find a movie on native legends that isn't completely cheesy, but this one is pretty good. i was drawn into all of the legends and got to see present native peoples with the dignity i associate with their past. i like how they ended the movie with hope and the acting was pretty good."
5,Fantastic Storytelling,This was a beautiful tale of a young man and his Grandfather as they make a journey together with the Grandfather weaving beautiful tales from many different Native American tribes together. Along with the visually beautiful tales it also includes moments of humour and lessons of life. Very similar to Arabian Nights in the way one story melts into another while a 'present-day' tale plays out. Well worth the watch.
4,"Great Movie, Not in HD","I first saw this movie on abc in December of 2003. I purchased it recently, but I am dissapointed in the film quality. The movie looks scratchy when you are wathcing it. This was a big let down for me since I originally saw it in HD on ABC. The movie is still good enough, though, that it is a good purchase."
1,Disappointed.,"I was excited about this movie. Even though it was a Hallmark film,I figured it would be a good clean family movie that's well made...WRONG! This movie is very poorly filmed. It looks like it was filmed using and old camcorder and is very dark and grainy. The story is not bad but I will be putting this one in our future yardsale movie box! It was so bad that I know I'd never watch it again. Very amateur, very poor picture and TERRIBLY cheap effects. Worst T.V. movie ever made. Very disappointed and very surprised by all of it's very high reviews. If your looking for a clear picture with great visual effects and good old fashioned Native-American movie action, this is not for you. If none of these things bother you then knock yourself out!"
5,I second the Boo to the Amazon reviewer...,"This is an amazing and beautifully done tale. The Amazon reviewer mentioned that it lacked overall structure to hold it together...I think the Amazon reviewer lacks the understanding to review this work! Not only does it have a lovely interwoven structure of myth and reality, it teaches us on many levels (as good stories always do!) while keeping us gently but firmly within the bounds of the story. Coyote and Spider are just so charmingly BAD! My only criticism is that Shane's character was, at the beginning, somewhat flat and predictible, but that melted away as the script unfolded. Overall, bravo to Hallmark for a wonderful production and to the cast for an outstanding performance!"
5,Excellent little film,"This is an excellent little film. We use it in the classroom to illustrate the difference between different types of cultural narratives and it is a very engaging and exemplary film for that reason. We have a high Native American population and they really get involved in the stories and the film. I highly recommend this film to educators, or to anyone interested in Native American lore."
1,Possibly great movie not accessible for some deaf people.,"My family watched the movie (they can hear), but although this movie was advertized and the box indicated it was 'captioned', we tried for 90 minutes to make the captions display. When there is no 'subtitle' menu, often the captions cannot be accessed, and there is no way to tell why or how. I tried turning 'off' my captions on the TV, turning the TV captioning to 'CC2', etc. and I gave up. I paid for a movie that is not accessible to me, and this was a huge loss, as my grandson and his Mom are Navajo, and I planned to watch this movie with them."
5,Wonderful story Artfully told,"This is one of the best DVD's I have seen in a long time. A moving story FINALLY told from the Native viewpoint with primarily Native actors. It is a window into the culture historically and today. It is also technically brilliant. The seamless move between the central story and the legends of the past is magnificent. I am only sorry that it was ""made for TV"" and not released in major theaters. Everyone should see this beautifully done story of connection."
5,Dreamkeeper,"AMAZING! I was able to catch this movie over the holiday break and let me say it was the absolute highlight of my holiday! Not only was my family captivated but also some guests that were staying over with us vowed to watch it on the following night when they got home! Amazing graphics, amazing details, amazing authenticity - I just can't say enough! I will be adding this treasure to my collection!"
1,Not a good product.,"I thought this blower would blow much faster. This blower has no adjustable fins and the heater attachment with the blower, blows out very little heat, more cold than heat. Not a good product."
2,Gemeinhardt repairs,"I respect the high school student's review, however, for the price, she could have purchased a far superior flute. I majored in flute in undergraduate school and it was there that I learned how Gemeinhardt flutes just don't hold up. Repairs become frequent and costly."
2,Black-and-white book with little depth,"First, I'm an atheist myself.The book is fiction, yes. But the twists and turns of its speculation are highly unlikely -- highly unlikely -- to come close to reality in the U.S. Even the most likely, the intelligent design chapter, I give less than a 1 in 10 chance, and that's being generous.As for one other reviewer, saying this deserves a place on bookshelves under critical religion studies -- that's only if your bookshelf is totally empty in that category and you need something."
3,Concept album on immigration is unsatisfying,"This is probably the weakest recording in this famed (and now, sadly, defunct) Irish group's repertoire. The first few tracks are fabulous ballads, but there's way too many songs on the Irish in the U.S. That's fine for Irish-Americans, but tiresome for everybody else."
4,"Unfortunately, now, sadly defunct","Although the review of May, 1999, was premature, the Wolfe Tones are no more as of January 8, 2002, when the group broke up after their last concert in Limerick. Fans of the Wolfe Tones would do well to gather up all their albums as they are now classics of a group that, sadly for their fans, is no more."
4,Manager versus Leader,"Learning the differences between manager and leader are essential to successful executives. Bennis and Nanus' book gives specific examples of the fundamental elements needed for both positions, beginning with strategies, the first of which is having a vision for the organization. Meaningful quotes from dozens of world leaders throughout the book, many of which were interviewed for their leadership views. The authors end with leadership empowerment, a motivational closing to anyone with their sights set on being a successful leader. Recommended reading for those on their way up as well as a good reminder of the importance of staying focused for those already leading."
4,Great book on leadership,I am a fond reader and follower of Bennis. He is usually right on the money with leadership.
2,Kraa! The Sea Monster,"The evil Lord Doom sends an amphibious monster into the Omega Quadrant to initiate the destruction of Earth, and it is up to intergalactic policeman Mogyar and a group of unsuspecting humans to stop the 200-foot menace! KRAA is Full Moon's response to the GODZILLA remake of 1998, but even fans of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers will find this all to be a bit silly. Considering the cheapness of the production, however, the scale miniatures and creature design are really quite impressive. An incredible amount of care has gone into the construction of this project, and Kraa's explosive rampage through the streets of New Jersey stacks up against many of the lesser Kaiju Eiga. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the acting or plot, but anyone willing to pick up a film called KRAA! THE SEA MONSTER will know what to expect. A resume booster for the special effects team, but only mild entertainment for monster fans.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,Even *I* have standards...,"Actually, to be honest, KRAA!The Sea Monster is... blah. It's not good enough to be interesting, but not bad enough to be worth making fun of. It's just basically a waste of time. I have been known to watch some pretty bad movies, but I won't watch this one again unless Little Sis wants to see it.The only good thing about the movie is KRAA! himself. Not anything he does, 'cause he really doesn't do anything, but the costume/whatever. He? is gorgeous, with vivid colors and some very nice details. If you get the chance to see screen shots/pics of the monster, check them out. Don't watch the (alleged) movie though... unless it's free... and you have nothing else to do. Really. Nothing.N"
1,A riduculous waste of time,"Kraa is supposed to destroy the earth, but he doesn't seem to take his assignment very seriously. Instead he just stands around in the same spot, waving his arms and shrieking until he gets shot. Our protagonists are assisted by a thingamajig which is variously described as a ""talking sandwich"" and a ""cheese covered crab,"" and those descriptions are not far off. This thing is the only interesting part of the movie, and by interesting I mean you're so disturbed by it, it's hard to divert your eyes from it. It looks like a giant mushroom with hands; it speaks in an Italian accent and is covered with what looks like vomit. The movie looks like it was filmed in a couple hours. It makes Ed Wood look like Robert Altman by comparison. Throw a dart in the video store, and you'll hit something that's a whole lot more entertaining than this crap."
1,Absolutely dumb!,"This movie has a talking sandwich in it, how could you not like it? The acting is wooden, the special effects are laughable (even for a B movie), and the plot is rather vapid and torpid to say the least. The monster, however, looks cool, but don't expect anything grand if you see this. I mean this is to bad to even be on Sci-fi!!!"
2,Not Again...,"I really had hope for this book since I like Liz Carlyle. But I should have learned from the last two. While it was an ok read, its a read I've read over and over before not only by other authors but by Ms Carlyle herself...in the same series it seems! I didn't particularly like the characters. I wished I had felt more of their love for each other rather than all the lust. It seemed like that's mostly what their relationship was based on. It would have been nice to have more character developement. Perhaps if it had started off from where it all began in detail instead of those small flash backs then maybe it would have been a great story."
1,""" Very, Very Disappointed""","I'll have to agree with the person that said, ""I think she wrote this because she had to."" This book was so very boring. Not to mention there are only two sex scenes throughout this entire long and drawn out story. The hero and heroine are forgettable characters. The heroine is quite unlikable. This plot is not so bad; it's just that this was not put together well at all. I was very disappointed. This book was extremely hard for me to read from beginning to end."
4,boy was someone having a bad day,"when they wrote that review claiming this book was boring and hackneyed.I liked it a great deal, interesting story, interesting characters and quite a good read."
3,Next time I want to be swept away!!,"The author is a superior wordsmith but this is one of her weaker works. By focusing on the stereotypical ""dour"" Scot for her male lead everything else that follows seems stuffy and without wit or sparkle. The female lead seems to have just one note to play about a devious father and overall it was just too much work pushing my way through this heavy text. However, there is a lot of quality background research done that gives almost a sense of ""Dicken's"" to the building of a big city in the 19th century. So many better books sweep you away--this poor critter just settles like dust on the floor."
1,no more liz carlyle for me,"I cant even finish the book. I'm so sick of the herione. When she's not being self-righteous she's crying. When she finally admits to herself that she was such a guillable, passive little idiot she still feels Merrick shared the blame - how is that? By remaining unconscious instead of chasing after her I guess. She is a coward and an idiot and certainly not someone I want to read a book about.This trilogy was awful. I used to really enjoy Liz Carlyle but I'm done - she isn't even writing - this is simple regurgitation. If she's going to keep putting out copycats she should at least use one of her better books to copy."
3,Beautiful and dark romance but sometimes tiresome,"I loved the plot but the heroin got into my nerves for being so secretive and suspicious. They could have talked things over once and for all, but at these moments, the heroin will have some ailment, fear, tireness, you name it, stretching the story on many pages and finishing the book so suddenly with a quick happy end. I could have cut most parts when she was ""not felling well"" and made a better end for the book.Nevertheless the hero is hot and dark. Maddie was hot and cold from minute to minute, I just lose my patient with such heroin. She just didn't want to open her eyes and see her father for what he was, trying to sweep everything under the carpet and spend another years in the dark and blaming all in her ex."
5,The real deal,"This book is a fantastic first-person recounting of battle in the air. I first read this book when I was a teenager aspiring to become a navy pilot. As a former naval aviator, this book is even more interesting to me now, many years after I first read it. If you like military non-fiction, this book is for you."
4,"Not great but still contains good, solid info and a creative approach","Laurie Smith is a strong believer in finding what motivates you, what activities and interests are at the center of your life - and then using that starting point as a way to add personaity to your room.And that is the main advantage of this book...it doesn't use a cookie cutter or formula approach. Some rooms are based around family photos and colletions, while others might be focused on an collection of antique furniture.She also hopes that readers won't be too conservative or focused on having everything match and that makes for lively, interesting rooms.Her home is a major part of this book so if you're looking for a variety of homes and styles, this may not be what you want. However, I found some inspiration here as well as a nice viewpoint about the whole decoration process, something that can seem intimidating. Smith proves that it does not have to be."
1,Disappointing,"The author's own home is the subject of this book. While a personal account can be charming, more useful information would have been so much more welcome in order to teach us readers how to make our homes look stylish. Unfortunately, there is very little of that here; only photos of the same rooms over and over from different angles and the authors musings. The bottom line: Save your money, unless you are interested in a vanity book with little content."
5,"A Wonderful, Beautiful Book!","If you love Laurie Smith's designs on Trading Spaces, you will be in design heaven with this book. Laurie takes us step by step through the renovation of her own lovely home. The book includes beautiful pictures, drawn floor plans, notes of what she will change in each room and then the beautiful after pictures. Not only do we get to walk through her home, but she gives us ideas on how to interpret her understanding of good design into our own homes. This book is a great addition to your decorating library!"
2,Expecting So Much More,I'm sad to say I was not impressed with this book. I love Laurie's style and her work on HGTV. This book had beautiful pictures that showed her great design talent. My main problem with the book was that it showed the same rooms of her house over and over again. I would have liked to have seen other projects and options. I was hoping for so much more from Laurie.
2,Pretty much of a vanity project for Ms. Smith,The photos of her home are beautiful but this read more like a remodeling diary of Ms. Smith's own domain. Many of the pictures are repeated over and over again. Clearing exploiting her fan base here and basically a vanity project.
5,Awesome Interior Design Insights,Love this book and refer to it often. Contains great before and after pics and excellent concise and helpful information on how to transform rooms into beautiful spaces.
3,Good gospel music.,the chatmans cd is nice a very fine group of people i meant in georgia. keep up yhe fine work.
1,disapointment,I ordered this bag thinking it would be nice and easy to distribute popcorn to guests and customers. Boy was I wrong. The bags were so flimsy. If you hed the bags by the bottom they would tip over and the popcorn salt and butter soaked right through them. On top of that the shipping cost more than the bags. I wil never order from them again.
2,Cute and Functional,"The bags are cute and functional, but they don't hold as much popcorn as I thought. When we eat popcorn while watching a movie we are going to eat more than just a couple of handfuls. The bags only hold a small amount, possibly for a small child."
3,Smaller then expected!,"These are really small and hold very little popcorn,could be good for small kids but are too small to hold an adult amount of popcorn"
4,we love eating our popcorn out of this bag.,"It is a little bit smaller than I thought it was going to be my husband has to refill his to satisfiy him but I think that it holds a good serving, and it works great with the scoop. I would recommend this"
3,Should have just been two discs of the 80s tracks,"In an attempt to make a career retrospective, John Watts has given us a 'sampler' of songs from every album he recorded with Fischer-Z and solo. Problem is, people who were into the new wave Fischer-Z sound of the 80s were not likely to follow Watts into the 90s alt rock feel, so this two disc set is not likely to truly appease anyone completely. I DO like that the 80s catalog begins and ends on disc 1, so I never have to play disc 2 at all, but since Fischer-Z albums are hard to come by on CD, it would have been great if this had been two discs worth of much of their 80s catalog. My other real problem here is that ""Need You"", a song I specifically bought this collection for, was clearly mastered from VINYL. There are noticeable snaps and pops on the track throughout the song!"
4,"A very interesting, but like the Bible, misleading book.","Mr. Vitz does a fantastic job of trying to explain the psychology behind atheism, in his inadequate experiments he assumes that atheists have poor father figures. Nevermind that the United States is by far the most fatherless (greater proportion of single mom households), and most violent country in the world, and yet it is one of the most religiously devout. An interesting book that makes you wonder if Mr. Vitz was ever really an atheist to begin with."
3,Installing longer tension springs then original,I asked your employee for advise to install longer springs then original because the original broke twice already. The advise was positive.But when installing I realized that a longer spring for the same door has a shorter travel. It lifts the door withe the sametension as the old spring but the spring unwinds before it is fully open and when the door opens further the cable that pullsthe door get lose from the pulley and the door get stuck when you close it back. So the door travel has to be shorter.So a longer spring has more power to lift the door but has a shorter travel for the same door weight.
5,Deterrence and Attribution helped once will help now,"During the Cold War from the 1950s until the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union, we faced adversaries (including China) that could with impunity launch ICBMs and airborne bomber fleets. In response we spent billions building radars to attribute the nuclear attack to the country which launched the ICBMs and bombers.It worked.We're here.The strategy was called deterrence. Mutually Assured Destruction. MAD.Today we need to employ the same strategy of Attribution and Deterrence against our new nuclear armed adversaries.The delivery system they are selecting will not necessarily be limited to ICMBs and bomber fleets. It will included weaponized civilian transportation systems. Airplanes and sea containers. 9/11 was a sample of a scary future.We can stop it.Let's build a nuclear sensor network. Attribution and Deterrence worked once.It can and will work again.Matthew Schor, Trojan Defense."
3,Political correctness triumphs over integrity,"I got this book prompted by Allison's brilliant ""Essence of Decision"" on the Cuban Missile Crisis. Nuclear Terrorism starts out well with an informative discussion of the nuts and bolts and history of nuclear proliferation. However, the final third of the book was a major disappointment. I suspect that Dr. Allison was mostly concerned with continuing to receive invitations to stylish cocktail parties in academia and felt obliged to bash the Bush policy on Iraq and to tout precisely the namby-pamby gutless policies he had just pointed out had failed to work consistently in the past. We should have a more ""humble"" foreign policy and get all other nations to agree not to let any other nations have nuclear weapons. That's what we tried to do during the 1990s and now face a nuclear North Korea, Pakistan, and possibly Iran, whereas Bush's get-tough policy kicked Libya out of the potential nuclear club. I would have expected better of Allison."

5,The passing of a great neighborhood,"This is a area in Massachusetts that I was born and raised in, attended school, played as a child married in had two children My husband and I moved out at just the right time. As we both look back with all our old friends tears come to our eyes as what has happened to our home area.This book is written in fact and not in fiction. Hittel Levine has told it as it was"
3,"Easy Guitar - Piano, no arrangements...","It does have a lot of songs in it, but it doesn't state that is in the 'Easy Guitar Chords, Easy Piano' type, no arrangements at all."
4,Just like the old days!,"This book is meant for my daughter (15 years of age) who is starting to learn to play guitar. I was 12 myself when i started to play guitar and i also used an eagles-book. And that was 34 years ago. There was an Eagles-songbook which was set up perfectly to learn it in a quick way. The first album on one side and desperado on the other side, with some nice photo's. Too bad i don't have this book anymore. This one has the same layout, as far as i can remember. She's learning quick now and she also plays saxophone for 5 years now and she is using this book also to blow some notes away.I only wonder if the chords are really the same, just like don felder and the others uses them. a 'g' for instance is showned as to be set with two fingers, while i know that a 'g' is with three."
1,Not enough info,"If you don't list the songs that are included in the book, what the hell good is it?I will not buy any compliation that won't tell me FIRST what is IN IT.Do you think we should just trust y'all?"
5,eagles guitar book,"This was a wonderful, easy to follow book with lots of songs in it and it opens well so that you can turn the pages while playing and still maintain some continuity. Very nice. I bought it for my grandson, however my son liked it too. They both play the guitar so they will get equal pleasure from it."
1,very disappointing,I cannot recommend this CD; quality of recording is not good; nor is track selection.
2,You Gotta Really Like Irish Drinking Songs,"I bought this CD to provide an Irish mood during St. Pat's day in our store. Some pieces are a bit raucus for background music, and many of them sound the same. I was a bit dissappointed. I'm also not Irish."
1,Be Warned!,"I am a huge fan of Orange Factory's remixes so I picked up this CD5, was I shocked when I popped it in my car CD player & it was a guy rapping over a lame dance beat. I soon parted ways with the CD & I am now very weary of anything By Orange Factory. I would have given it 0 Stars if that was an option."
3,Fish mailbox,Love the mailbox but I was a bit disappointed that the flag and hooks were plastic. I thought they would be metal. One of the hooks has already broken.
5,An Authentic Evocative Tale,"The Far Distant Oxus and it's sequels were among my favorite childhood books. I recently re-read them and was once again swept into a world in which children create their own adventures, a river, the forest, the moores are an invitation to adventure and life is filled with endless possibilities. The relationships between the children are very real, with just a tinge of mystery. I found myself nostalgic for a childhood that I never had after reading them again. Written by teenagers, the book lacks any sentimentality, rather the authors' youth seems to have lent an authenticity to the thoughts and feelings of the featured children. I wish someone would publish it again."
5,"A dazzling photography book of the flora, fauna, and scenery of Lake Superior","Lake Superior Secrets is a dazzling photography book of the flora, fauna, and scenery of Lake Superior. A caption of one to two sentences garnishes each beautiful, full-color image, caught on film by Bruce Montague, a nature photographer with over 15 years experience. An especial treat for nature lovers, as its photographs illuminate everything from wind-blown sand and snow dunes to ancient pictures written in red ochre on stone cliffs to a stunning image of a ring-billed gull against a clear blue sky. Highly recommended."
4,The Graduate Meets James M. Cain,"Holden's strength has always been his prose, and the Fitzgeraldian lyricism of his words pull the reader effortlessly through this book. There's A LOT of sex in ""The Narcissist's Daughter,"" however, and although at first it seems appropriate for the ""Graduate"" meets James M. Cain plot, eventually a few too many fetishistic variations make the novel read more like ""The Kinsey Report"" than ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" It's that overdose of perversity coupled with a less than sympathetic protagonist that may leave a bad taste in the reader's mouth even as the convoluted plot races to it's appropriately shocking ending."
2,Rather disappointing indeed.,"As a student in the lineage of Trungpa Rinpoche, I have great respect for his brilliance. This hagiography, however, was alternately infruriating and embarassing. If there is an official North Korean biography of Kim Il Sung, I imagine it reads much like this book in tone. As other reviewers have noted, Midal violates the first lesson of writing in that he tells, he doesn't show. I agree with Midal's objection that it is silly to expect a biographer to savage his subject. That doesn't mean, however, that one must write a slavish piece of propoganda instead. There's no need to tidy up and oversell Trungpa Rinpoche."
4,Highly Recommended,"An excellent biography of the brilliant and controversial teacher. The author's use of anecdotes is informed, thoughtful and with a clear sense of purpose. The text, while conveying deep meanings throughout, is a smooth read. The quality of the writing reflect the fact that Fabrice Midal is both a university professor and a Buddhist practitioner. Ian Monk -- who previously worked on The Quantum and the Lotus (L'infini dans la paume de la main) -- should be commended for a transparent translation.I have increasingly appreciated Chogyam Trungpa's vision since my first encounter with his teachings seven years ago that immediately shattered most of my views. It is now a pleasant surprise for me to come across this book -- it articulates Rinpoche's vision in terms of his actions and their contexts."
1,Yet to come,Hopefully this biography will inspire others to write more and better about Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. It would probably be most helpful if future attempts make a firm stand on either a devotional approach or a research based one. The misalliance of the two leave this bereft of the vitality and originality that characterized Trungpa Rinpoche's life.
4,Very well written,"In Dec 1966, I was privileged to have been picked by the Div G2 to assist Capt James as the team leader for an experimental team which if successful would evolve into the development of more teams. In 1966, Capt James and I were the only two individuals in the Cav's Lrrps. As I read this book, I was amazed at how the author put this all together and as I continued to read, I wondered where I had been during all that time when I and James were the first two soldiers in the Lrrps. This book describes a unit that I did not serve with nor did I have anything to do with yet my name is mentioned in the book. If this is the unit I helped James form, then this book is a novel and should not be considered a nonfiction. I would like to however, compliment the authors writing abilities."
1,Making believe,"Now, who in their right mind would belive some of these stories. For instance, the author writes that a team is told to get out of an AO (area of operation) in the middle of the night because a B-52 strike was coming in. DAH!!!! No can do, GI. Why'd this author quit when he heard about a team getting wiped out? Why'd he quite when the helicopter he was in got fired at? Quiters never win in the long run. They only quit."
1,Sensationalized crap,"A cynical attempt to cash in on the critical success of Nick McDonell's ""Twelve,"" from a writer who's done much better. I guess Beckerman's modest amount of (local) celebrity went to his head."
1,off the mark....,"I am ""stunned, breathless and absolutely horrified"" at the way that teenage sexuality and courting rituals are blown out of proportion with the use of scare tactics such as rape, suicide and general malice.Well, I suppose its an easy way to make a quick buck."
1,No substance - No value,"This book is very boring, full of stories that never end, with ONE POINT: all teenagers have no respect for their bodies, and they are having sex like rabbits! The author tries to make his views more legitimate by providing so many statistics.1. The book is not interesting2. The idea of the book, teens and their insatiable desire for sex, is very old by now.3. The book tries to scare people into moral panic rather than give a true picture of all types of teenagers."
5,REALITY CHECK,This is a work of fiction.Please try and remind yourselves of this before writing any further reviews. It is fiction...... Not based on true events either. No supporting interviews. Geezum this is a portrayl of teenage life in the authors fictional world.Its just a lame story.
1,loathsome,"Typical MTV Books idiocy. Beckerman is the second coming of Bret Easton Ellis -- and that's not a good thing. Ellis, too, tried to pass off his flat, soulless writing as a commentary on the nihilism and sexual anomie of young adults, and his mean-spirited characterizations, like Beckerman's, had zero resonance. They're just caricatures. The statistics and news-story excerpts providing this book's framework are the only thing that take it beyond complete self-indulgence, but even that's not saying much."
3,"Gen, SLUT research","This book was purchased for the statistical content and it's research value only. For those purposes it was an effective resource. The content violates every moral value I try to uphold, still, I could not ignore the reality of the facts presented in the book. I do not reccommend this book for any other purpose than research."
1,completely off center,"Yes i do realize that this is a work of fiction, but the quotes alone simply play into the stereotypes of an entire generation. I am a part of generation Y. I am an average 21 year old and i have never experienced the type of ""real"" adventures any of the interviewees claim at such a young age. It appears as if Beckerman just wanted to be shocking. really, marty, we are all terribly impressed to know about your sexual acts and the fact you apparently needed to find the sluttiest and most insecure drunk underage children to interview for the filler pages of quotes in your book. I believe this is a nice book for people of generation Y to read to understand the bias views many have. But i know it comes off as incredibly one sided and misleading to everyone reader without half a brain and insulting to those who do."
4,raunchy,"a little too raunchy for me, and ok i guess that is the point, so congrts to the author for that but i think it takes away from the level of funniness. you can be funny w/o being so rude and obnoxious. again, that is funny but a little over the top that's all."
2,Nothing new under the sun,"Anyone praising this novel as original has likely not read its multitude of predecessors, and many are so much better.Beckerman is certainly a talented writer and may have something more to offer as he matures, but he provides little here that hasn't been done much better by Bret Easton Ellis (LESS THAN ZERO) and Jay MacInerney (BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY). Even the mediocre TWELVE by Nick McDonell has a little more to offer. The sexual subject matter here is descriptive but seems rather silly at some points, and no more shocking than your basic MTV video.I'll keep an eye out for his next book, but this one is second rate."
1,sophomoric,"I have been for a long time interested in books about the men and women and cultural studies. That is what I thought I was getting with this book. I was wrong.The writing of this book is incredibly sophomoric, with the serialized short stories being even less then that. There is no insight into what drives this new rage of sexuality, nor its effect on this generation of sex obsessed kids. What commentary there is on the effects is only looks at the surface and doesn't delve into noteworthy.This book feels more like it is written by someone who is sex crazed rather then a look critique of anything."
1,Hahahahahaha...,"With a name like Zarkorr what were you people expecting. Actually it seems as though the actors are having a blast, and there are alot of funny lines in this movie (ala ""what are you some kinda...question asker?"") It is really poorly made but if you have a since of humor you can enjoy this pretty pathetic movie."
3,Funny Flick,"This movie may not be the most glamoris special effects movie, but it is still a good movie. Special effects doesn't make a movie people. It could have been better, and if you like monster flicks check this one out. If you buy it, get a used."
5,One of the most unintentionally hilarious movies ever!,"Sources say the monster scenes were filmed before anyone had even written a script. I believe it.An oddball combination of clever writing, horrible acting and bizarre special effects make this a great film to watch. Especially funny is the reaction each character gives when they find out the hero is a postal worker. The ""Making of..."" short at the end was probably intended to highlight the brilliance of the director, but instead leaves you wondering how it ever managed to even be this good.Do not watch this film alone, make sure you have a number of people to laugh along with you or you will never make it through the slow parts. This is a perfect addition to any bad movie party."
1,Zarkorr is a ZERO!!,"Next to the putrid ""King Kong Lives"", ""Gargantua"" & the original ""Yonggary"" (1966) this is one of THE worst giant monster films ever produced! What a hackneyed, waste of 80 minutes of your life this film is!!And you know what the most incredible thing about Zarkorr The Invader is? It was not Japanese produced but U.S. none the less in 1996!! One somewhat expects this kind of ... poor minatures & inane dialog from maybe old Gamera films but, not a U.S. film in made in the mid-90's!! The only redeeming quality about Zarkorr is the monster's overall appearance (cool). Unfortunately, one only sees about 10 minutes total of the monster throughout the entire film! The remaining 70 minutes you are subjected to hammy over the top ""acting"" & meaningless gum flapping-YEECH!!"
1,Pure Crap,"One of the most cheesy books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. I had to force myself to keep reading, thinking it couldn't get any worse. You are told that if you follow her advice, you too will get 3 job offers in a week and a date! Wow, if only life were this easy. She also seems proud of her Sister Goddesses in training who basically turn into what most women would label loose...I think what I disliked most were her examples of women in her class, I found them irritating and silly.If a man pulled this crap, he would be accused of manipulating women for his own gain."
5,a must for every woman,If your relationship is stale.quit blaming and read this book. It is empowering and every woman needs to understand how to find pleasure to be her authentic self
5,Mama Gena's School of Womanly Arts,"This book is a must read for both male and female, I've learner more from her than I care to admit. I've given this one book to all my close friends and they all thank me..........Right on Mama Gena, thanks for giving my life a reason to live life again."
5,Mama helped me find my inner bitch!,"I have owned this book for several years, and for the most part continue having fun without being reminded. However, I recently met a man who really was impossible to relate to as we started an ill-fated romance. Ultimately, he sent me an email to dump me saying he was getting back with his bi-polar girlfriend. ?@*!!??? I sent a whimpy response saying something about us all hitting our ""reset buttons"" and mentioned I probably wouldn't be able to be friends for a while.A week went by. I dusted off my copy of this book and started reading it. A few more days go by. Then I sent him another email subtitled: ""This Is The One That Tells You Off.""And I commenced to tell him off. I had lost contact with my inner bitch, but with Mama Gena's help I got in touch with her again."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"Such a waste of money! The writing is horrible, the advice is ludicrous. The gist of this book - live a life of complete irresponsibility and selfishness at the expense of others....and (as another reviewer noted) THINK ABOUT YOUR PRIVATES.There are many other books to encourage mindful sensuality and pleasure. This one is a waste of space."
1,Stupid,I've never given a book a one-star review before. The one star is for the exercises in the book but the writing itself is awful. What a waste of money. I'm not even going to give this one to the library -- it's going straight into the recycling bin.
1,"Read the book, met the school","While I give the book kudos, I'd veer away from the school itself. I went to the school after calling them saying I'd love to work there only to find out they weren't hiring (lied on the phone) and to work there I needed to take *all* the classes. They had me on one couch and three other women telling me to give them money. Trying to like push me into whipping out my check book and take classes.I think it's nice to help women see the light, but not push them into paying an arm and a leg.Seriously, they ask for five thousand dollars to take their classes. Buy the book, get some healthy friends that are open about love and learning and do it for free."
5,Every woman should own a copy!,"As pleasure activists and sex and intimacy coaches, this is one of our favorite books. Mama Gena reminds all women to get back to their deepest desires, to have fun and play with life again, both for their own satisfaction and because nothing is hotter than a woman who loves pleasure."
3,amusing enough,"I purchased this book at the recommendation of a psychic I went to see. I read it really with a grain of salt, not as a means of boosting my own self confidence, though it has that effect when it wants to. This is not ""deep"" material; it's just fun. If I took it seriously, I would have found many of the example sister goddesses (aka SG's) given to be tremendously shallow and wonder if they were real people or the author indulging herself for the book's purpose. I found many of these suggestions I was already doing (just the way I am, I guess), but it was nice to have the encouragement. I say buy it for a laugh."
2,Waste of time.....,"It was a boring book. She just staes common sense. nothing new, no new insights. It was a waste of time and money...."
1,"For the sad, lonely, and disdainful.","If you liken men to primitive trainable dogs, then this might be a good book for you - but if after reading it, you still find yourself disdainful and manless, you will most likely realize that no bulls**t book or classes can give you self esteem (or a satisfying relationship). Put your time into concrete projects like volunteering. Men don't owe you anything, no matter what a class or book tells you and they especially don't like it when you keep reminding them that you are a ""goddess"".. YUCK!!! I was given this book as a gift, and promptly placed it where it belongs - in the trash."
1,Mama Gena's,The writing was boring and simplistic. There was no real insight to her advise. I found it to be a waste of money and a real waste of time.
1,"A dopey, boring book!!","Even one star is too much for this silly, boring book. With its childish dribble and senseless stories, the author sounds like she can't be more than twelve years old. My only consulation is that I bought a used copy so I didn't waste too much money."
2,Condition not what expected.,"The book was marked very good condition. It was full of writing and highlighting. The book on the outside was in good condition, but the inside was a mess."
1,Is this a joke?,"A friend of mine raved about this book and how it changed her love life. After reading it, I bet it did. (My husband would have me in an institution if I were to follow some of the author's suggestions.) This is a book recommended by Oprah so you know you will not have any heavyweight material here."
4,Gentleman Jim on the Job,"I still have my old 33 1/3 vinyl of ""The Jim Reeves Way"", a bit tattered but the album is unscratched. I ordinarily wouldn't recommend ANY album where the singer covers songs that are virtual signature songs of other singers, even if they were recorded later in some instances. This CD has songs remembered as being sung by Gene Autry, Eddy Arnold, Jerry Wallace, Don Gibson and who knows else. I can recall only ""Somewhere Along the Line"" as a Reeves hit in America. I could be wrong. But his renditions of others' songs are so good and the non-commercial cuts, ""Nickel Piece of Candy"", ""Where Do I Go to Throw a Picture Away?"", ""Maureen"", and ""Ek Verland (sp) Na Jou"" (""I'm Missing You"") from South Africa where he was enormously popular are so exceptional, I must recommend this. The songs need not conjure up specific memories. Jim could have sung from the telephone book and sounded good. I recommend this twofer highly."
5,WOW!!!,"Moonlight and Roses is very good. But The Jim Reeves Way will blow you away! Fantastic songs, excellent arrangements by Anita Kerr, excellent musicians and background vocals, and almost unbelieveable singing from the greatest singer I have every heard! If you like Jim Reeves and the Nashville Sound, you need to get this. And don't lose it. You will want your children to hear this man sing."
3,Nostalgia for Country Western,Nice collection. Many tracks including some old favorites of mine. Sound a little outdated but not bad. If you liked Jim Reeves you will like this. If you didnt have a nice day. JPP
1,Good product but Very Slooow Delivery!,"Ok, I thought I'd try aroma therapy so I ordered it. The product is good but I hated how long it took to get delivered!!! It was very unacceptable. How long does it really take to deliver a damn 2 ounce bottle? 16 days!!! Are you kidding me?! I am very unsatisfied with this seller. Will NEVER order again."
2,VERY strong scent--overpowering & soapy smelling,"This product may be great for *some* purpose, but even a couple of drops in a bathtub of water was rather overpoweringly soapy smelling. (I understand I must have smelled some lavender soap in my lifetime.) It did not produce the intended, oft-promised effect (relaxation)."
3,Smells great even when opening the box,Just wanted to share that this oil seems to be wonderful so far. Purchased it to go into my soap. The only thing that I was disappointed in was I have contacted amazon twice to let them know that it was leaking when it arrived and no one has responded. So good product if you don't mind having a little leaking during shipping.
5,YUMMY SMELLING!,This smells so good and has a slight tingle to it. I have been using this along with Almond Oil and Castor Oil to help some major hair loss issues and remaining hair breakage as suggested by another reviewer. This is so nice and I even use a drop on my face at night and have noticed how much softer my skin is in the morning.
3,Not what I was expecting...,"The smell was not what I was expecting! I bought to use in my homemade laundry detergent, but it wasn't ""flowery"" smelling! I don't have anything else to compare it to because I have never used essential oils before. I would not recommend if you're wanting the ""flowery"" smell you are expecting from a store detergent with a lavender scent!"
5,smells wonderful,It helps me sleep at night and helps calm my nerves when I am stressed out with different things i like it combined with ylang ylang on my pillow.
1,Lavender who?,This product was a disappointment. The fragrance was unpleasent and not that of lavender! ...would not ever purchase again...
1,not what I expected according to customer reviews,I purchased this based on the rave reviews it had... really unhappy with this purchase... this smells VERY herbal... NOT FLORAL at all :(
1,questionable product,"I bought a small bottle of the NOW foods lavender oil and thought it was ok, not the best but passable for the price. When it was time to reorder I was given the choice to ""subscribe"" and get the larger bottle for a great price and since I use lavender oil a lot I thought this new subscription idea was great. Now I don't know if the subscribed bottle came from the same company but it had the same NOW label however the large bottle was HORRIBLE. It smelled like chemicals and didn't smell like lavender at all. Just gross. I canceled the subscription."
5,"Relaxing scent, perfect essential oil at a nice price","I am very picky about my scents and lavender is tough to find without it being overwhelming. However, this Now Foods version is nice, just the right amount for me. It doesn't take more than a few drops to be effective and fill the room with a fresh lavender scent. We use it for baths, lotion, and in our (natural) hand soap and are happy with its versatility."
5,The miracle oil,"This was the first essential oil I purchased and was blown away as soon as I twisted the top off the little brown bottle. Besides tea tree oil, lavander oil is known as the miracle oil because of its countless uses; a lot of them medicinal.THE GOOD:Smells perfect, quite literally the essence of lavander.Helps balance any skin type, reduces the amount of sebum for oily skin and nourishes dry skin.Helps balance the scalp, can treat dandruff or fight oil.Treats scraps/burns, athlete's foot and calms an upset stomachTHE BADI guess if I had to say one bad thing about this product, it would just simply be that the packaging doesresult is minor leaking. The dropper is flat, not at all extended. It is extremely minor, so don't let that stop your from purchasing such an outstanding item, if anything, think of it as keeping your bathroom/pantry smelling pleasant."
5,I Love the Smell!,"This is pure lavender oil and is an all natural product. NOW products tend to have a good track record and this is no exception.You can use this lavender oil in droplets in your bath; you can put a few little drops on a towel hanging on your towel rack and give your bathroom a fresh, clean aroma.I love this product and highly recommend it. The aroma of lavender is very pleasant. This lavender oil is very soothing to your skin. It is also a good deodorizer - just fill a squirt bottle with water and put 5-7 drops of lavender oil in said bottle. That makes an excellent and natural deodorizer and it is very effective! If you put a few drops on your skin after you bathe, it acts as a natural perfume."
5,Fabulous,"This is the real thing, the scent takes my breath away. It is so reasonable priced I couldn't believe it a large bottle also. I know lavender aficionados will love this oil."
4,No Dropper,Luv the scent with this one as well only disapointment again is there is no dropper. Have to pour contents out.
3,"Such a big bottle. I don't even know what to use it for,",I've had it for a more than 6 months now and I have 90% of the bottle left. I don't know how I'll use the rest of it. It's really concentrated stuff. I was surprised it didn't come with a dropper too. I guess the picture is misleading because it looks like there's a white tube down the middle. I had to go out an buy my own dropper. It doesn't have that wonderful floral smell. It smells bitter and is a little bit hard on the nose like molasses.
3,Too strong yet too weak,"I tried to use this lavender ol as a perfume and it was too strong, it almost smelled like a house hold cleaner. When I tried to use it in a diffuser it was too weak to change the smell in one room. So I am confused as to how to use the oil efectively."
4,Great for aromatherapy and cosmetic use,"I am a licensed massage therapist who uses essential oils in my practice every day, as well as in home made lotions, ointments, and cosmetics. This is a good quality oil at an excellent price. Lavender is medicinal and psychologically beneficial to many people, and is even used on burn units in Europe. The disparity between ""floral"" Lavender and ""woody"" or, as one person described, ""soapy"" smelling Lavender is the strain of the plant and location grown. This Lavender is not ""watered down"". Those who know what they are talking about know that you can't water down an essential oil, it would render it useless, and besides, its illegal."
1,Not Good,"The company will tell you this is 100% real lavender oil. I am sure it is. But, it smells like the leaves and stems and not like the flower. Good lavender oil smells like the actual bloom, not green like this. Much better brands include Aura Cacia and 100% Pure Essential oils. These smell so much better. I wouldn't buy now EVER again, even for a better price. I emailed the company and told them that I would not purchase their products until the quality of them improved. A lot of people tend to buy now because they can't tell the difference between what it should and shouldn't smell like. All you have to do is try a better brand once and you'll be able to tell. Consumers need to fight for better products or the companies who take your money will keep selling you worse products whether discounted or expensive to get your dollars! Don't do it. It would be better even to make your own. Now is not a good brand.NOW Foods Lavender Oil, 4 ounce"
5,"Lavender Oil, 4 ounce",I didn't realize that NOW Foods carried the lavender oil in a 4 oz bottle. I have been buying the 1 oz bottles for 10.50 in the town that I live and got a 4 oz bottle for 20.00! I am extremely pleased!
5,Seems like good stuff,"authentic lavender scent. (like smelling a lavender bush)seems like it is what it claims to be...%100 pure essential oil. (good price if this is true)mixed with peppermint oil and use on temples, forehead, etc for headaches...amazing"
3,Good but I've bought better,"on time and in good condition, good scent but it's a little ""watered down"" (figuratively speaking). Not bad by any mean but I have bought better."
2,Question: When does lavender smell like peppermint?,"Answer: When it is shipped by Amazon.I ordered Lavender Oil, the wrapping said Lavender Oil, but the bottle was Peppermint Oil.Since essential oils are not returnable (the option is not available) all I could do was leave a message about the packaging. Because information posted to this site is collated but not replied to, it amounted to nothing being done about it. One of the most frustrating purchases I have made from Amazon.Finally got tired of waiting and reordered more Lavender Oil. It arrived safely today."
2,Grassy smell like rosemary oil,"I read that lavender oil is supposed to be calming and soothing with a hint of floral.I decided to order this since it has so many good reviews. This is my first time purchasing lavender oil, so i didn't know how it suppose to smell. This come off notoriously herb-like. I know lavender is an herb but i could only smell grass-like smell. The hint of floral note come last, but it smell kinda grassy as well. It smell pungent like the rosemary oil I bought from another supplier. This oil is suppose to be soothing, but i can't stand it. I have to mix in double amount of sweet orange oil to mask the grassy smell. I wouldn't purchase it again. Can anyone tell me if their oil smell this way? or maybe mine is a bad batch?"
5,very fragrant,"This brand of Lavender essential oil is very fragrant, easy to use with the built-in dropper top and a good price. The scent lingers for a good long time."
5,Good value,This seems much better value than the small bottles. My one problem with it is that the dropper part is in the lid rather than the bottle so I tend to pour way more than the 5 drops I want. It is genuine lavender oil though.
4,16 ounce bottle,"good value and good e-tailing service. But the spout on the top of the bottle is flimsy and when i went to pour oil on my aroma stone, the spout came lose and oil spilled everywhere!"
3,A little weak,"The price was great and it's 100% pure lavender oil. It smells clean. Unfortunately it's not nearly as strong as the Young Living stuff. Example: I can put 10 drops of the Young Living lavender oil into my mist diffuser and the room smells like a lavender field. If I put 10 drops of NOW Foods' lavendar oil into the diffuser, I can barely smell it. I believe that it's 100% pure and all that, but the concentration levels aren't anywhere near Young Living, or another pure oil I purchased (forget the brand)."
3,I would look for high end,"This product just has that cheep smell about it, don't know what it is but totally no worth the money."
5,Great for aromatherapy,"I bought this product to use in my yoga classes. I put one drop onto a clean washcloth before class, then place that cloth over the students' eyes during savasana. They are amazed at the aroma and that it was just one drop that did it! I also mixed some into my almond oil that I use on my skin, and get to enjoy the wonderful fragrance all day long! This is also a great price if you've ever looked at other essential oils. Thanks Amazon!"
2,"Love the product, hate the substandard packaging","I ordered the 2 oz in december and loved it. I now added it to my subscribe and save list and ordered a 4 oz bottle. the pacakge arrived on time but the lid was loose when I got it and had leaked a wee bit. When I opened the cap, the stopper cap inside was stuck to the lid and so I have a bottle where I have to use a syringe to take a few drops everytime I have to use it. I am so disappointed with the packaging!!The oil is great- no doubt about it. But why would someone buy a bottle of aromatherapy with bad packaging and have spillage everytime you use it!"
5,"Aromatherapy for the ""financially challenged""","These are the best priced, quality products on the market. I have used inexpensive brands before and found them lacking in every aspect and not worth my time or money. ""Now Personal Care"" oils are a great price for a quality product."
1,broken,I received the lavender bottle brokeni send mail about it 3 times with no answerdid any one answer me ?thanksHesham
2,Crushed Greens like lavender,"Don't like. It's supposed to be lavender, Pure, but I don't like the smell. It is as if some of the green parts of the plants were crushed on the process and it retains the bitterness of it all."
1,Smells Terrible,I've used other products that are scented with lavender and this smells nothing like those! It smells like a rotten old lady! Sooooooo gross. Definitely not worth the money. I want to just dump it down the drain.
1,Lavender Essential Oil 4 ounce,I don't like this one. It doesn't smell pretty at all. I wouldn't recommend this item nor purchase it again.
4,Nice and mild,This has a nice and mild scent to it. I gave it a four star because it was so expensive... not sure if I needed or would ever use up the 16oz. But for sure I won't purchase again.
5,Amazing scent!!!,This oil is just amazingggg!!! it is strong and longlasting.... Product NOW has really exceeded my expectations. Really recommend this Product.
1,This is not what lavender smells like,"This is not what REAL lavender smells like. While the price was very affordable, which is why I bought it, the smell is horrendous. I have tried many different ways to make this smell good with no success. I am a lavender freak, I wear it as perfume, I use it in diffusers, warmers, use lavender candles etc. I have mixed it with other good lavender, mixed it with water, mixed it with other scents...you name it, I tried it. I am throwing away 3/4 of a bottle.....wasteful!I now wish I had simply returned it when I got it instead of wasting time and punishing my nose. If you are a true lover of lavender scent...do not buy this one.Spend the money, get a better quality lavender."
1,bad batch,"I bought this previously about a year ago and it was some of the best and most fragrant lavender oil I've purchased. This time, same brand, smelled like....NOTHING. It was a mild and slightly foul smell. I know this is a commodity and that all brands get the oil in quantity from very few sources but there really should be quality control. I'd pay more to buy from a company that avoids purchasing bad batches and most importantly, doesn't pass the bad stuff along to consumers."
4,"Great scent, but using sparingly","I decided to use this in my lotion bars, and the scent complemented the nutty smells that with the coconut oil and shea butter, however, having been the first kind of oil I've used, I used 4 drops per bar, which was WAY too strong a scent. But I was able to re-melt the bars and dilute it. Guess this is more my problem than the fault of the product.When diluted properly, it gives a great natural lavender scent. As expected from 100% lavender oil.."
3,OK for the price,"Plain as majority of other lavender oils. If someone ask me , I would not buy again for sure ."
5,GREAT BOOK,Just another book for my sons collection. He is really enjoying them. The pictures in these books tells the stories.
4,No problems,I have not owned this long enough (about a month) to give it a five star rating yet. But it has been perfectly functional and served it's purpose well so far.
5,One of our family's top five books,"This story is a beautiful interweaving of three stories, a Native American woman who loses her husband in war, a girl's relationship with her grandfather, and an old woman who discovers how to reach a lonely child that she has seen in the park. It is a gentle and lovely way to introduce to children the concept of death and a chance to discuss the value of the people we love in our lives and to understand the feelings of others. The story is wonderful in itself, but the illustrations make it even more so. They seem to glow with an inner light."
4,good service,"I bought this book for a class and was really amazed at the service , the book arrived on the second day, it was in very good condition. I loved everything about the service. would recommend it to all my friends."
1,woo woo,"I wouldn't put this stinker in the outhouse.The only way this could be scientific is if the dogmatic numnums ,who excreted this , could get lucky , find a real scientist and hit em over the head with it."
1,Nice features...If only they worked right.,"I bought this alarm because it had exactly the features I was looking for at a reasonable price. The installation was very passive, without all the annoying alarms that ask a passerby to step back, or huge lcd readout on the keychain.The first problem was that the trunk would randomly pop when the alarm was turned off. Not all the time, but enough that it required checking every time the doors were unlocked. Then the door locking became unreliable.For the install time and frustration in use, this rate very poorly with me."
3,Pyle PPA12 PA woofer,I bought this speaker to replace one in a Celestion cabinet. It states on the speaker it is 8 ohms which should be an exact match. The speaker works fine but only half the volume of the other original cabinet. So if you are buying them as replacement speakers you may have to change out both cabinets. Amazon shipping was very good.
2,Didn't work as described.,"This woofer was described as a Professional Premium woofer, it is certainly not. The Ohm loads vary so much that it kept tripping our amps. Once we replaced these (which were intended to be replacements) with Peavey speakers, the amps ran fine and we are back in business, short 80.00 we spent on 3 Pile speakers."
2,review,The Bell did not work and the score sheets were packed so that they were folded and wrinkled.I could only use the dice and instructions.
3,Worth seeing just for the title,"You can't expect much from a movie called ""Murdercycle"", but as C Grade Sci-Fi films go, it isn't all bad.Sure, there's a lot of unintentional comedy (like lasers that don't seem capable of giving a human a minor, irritating skin rash and a psychic who can be repelled just by thinking bad thoughts at her), and the acting ranges from adequete to subpar. But the film has a decent pace, and it kept me interested enough to watch to the end. Plus, it's got an alien cyborg motorcycle!One question though: Why do all aliens / monsters have such grainy, blurry vision? No wonder the Murdercycle kept missing with his stinging lasers of owie."
1,"So bad it's........well, bad!","First of all, if your looking to be entertained in any kind of conventional sense, then this is definitley not the movie for you. But if your looking for a movie that you can laugh at other than with, then look no further. A Full Moon pictures release which should really say it all. Bad props, bad CGI effects, horrendous acting, and a plot that requires the films budget not exceed $500. At least the goresploitation flicks of the past offered some really gruesome visuals. Even the fake stuff was kind of creepy. But this CGI crap...Man! I saw the trailer for this on the ""Killer Eye"" movie (which I turned off after about 20 minutes) and ordered it to give my friend as a gag-gift because we constantly quote the trailer for kicks. ""Kill that damn rider!!!"" and ""This is ground zero for the INVASION!"". HAHAHAHAHA. Maybe Full Moon makes these films solely to play a joke on people? I hope so, cause the alternative is far scarier. Please stop...."
1,Don't bother,"Ok, I admit it. I bought this DVD based on the title alone. I was thinking this might be a take-off on CHRISTINE, the car that's possesed by an alien. That was a great movie. This one sucked. Save your money.Doofus FJL"
5,Murder,"Murdercycle is da bomb! The special effects are great!! I'll give you a preview. A guy is attacked by an alien on a motorcycle. Some people go looking for the guy. A lady named Lee, who is a Psychic, two men who are from the CIA, and the rest, an army squd. They are attacked by the Murdercycle shortly. One of the guys named Wood(what a name) is such a jerk, you just want to [hurt] him, is hidding something from everybody, even from the other CIA guy(forgot his name). They find the guy who they were looking for, who was killed, but they stumble onto something else. They find a guy named Dikko(what another name) who was a friend of the guy who was killed. Thats all I'm telling you. If you want to know what happens you'll have to rent it or buy it. SEE YA!!!!!!"
5,A story about a woman,"Determination and heart --- That's what the heroine has in this wonderful story. It drops you right into the period ... I've watched this movie several times and always get emotional. I like that she is strong, she survives, makes the most of what she has and never compromises her values."
2,Cute,"This cute Cantonese film is a spin-off of America's ""American Pie"". I am sure it was a hit overseas, but I'm not sure it would be a hit to others. It had its moments...and the love between young teens is always fun to watch. It's worth a view (rental) but I won't be keeping this in my library. I have to admit I fast-forwarded on occasion. This is not for the kiddies either. There is some nudity and simulated sex, but it is done ""tongue-in-cheek"" to silly music. No profanity though...none at all. And remember, the language is Cantonese with English subtitles."
3,Kimihabokuni Niteiru,"I got this in Japan and it was pretty expensive for just having 4 songs.If you're a Gundam Seed Destiny Fan this might be good for a fanatic :oI didnt really like the other song; Silence Inside the Headphones. However, Kimihabokuni Niteiru (You Resemble Me) is beautiful.This CD includes You Resemble Me and Silence Inside the Headphones(vocal and instrumental)."
4,Loved it!,"this movie wants me to change the world.yes, change the world. change all that is supposedly right in it. The gap between rich and poor, male and female, black or white.It fills me with wonder...at how beautiful and poiganant life can be. and is.It also terrifies me because i relise how caught up we are in the ""race to make big"".every scene, word, character speaks to me.my favourite scene is when the black child girl comes to the birthday party of the white boy whom she plays cricket with,how he is embarrased to be with her.That is my world.What happens henceforth in the film ,gives me hope.It speaks of a world that is safe. secure.sound.sadly ,this isnt our world.but the film gives me hope.it can bewe can fill this world with wonder.we too, make a difference.we too, can change the world."
3,not bad for the price but if you want great transfers don't buy,this set chock full of gore movies and if you like them you will love this set. now the transfers are a little worst here than in other sets so its up to you you can pay a little(5 to 10 dollars more)and get these in other sets with better transfers.
4,Enjoyable,"Gore or More is enjoyable.. just needs more gore, the stories are good just needs more gore."
1,Surface Material,"I was disappointed in this study. I felt that the material was disjointed and lacked focus. The questions the study asked were leading and basic. It seemed that numerous questions were looking for pat answers. I read this book solo - maybe it would have helped if I had been part of a study group so the discussion could further the learning. As it stands, though, this book lacks depth and cohesiveness. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Poor study material,"I have been part of many women's Bible studies in my life. This is definitely not one I would recommend. Although you were asked to look up many verses they didn't fit together or lead you to any conclusions. Verses also didn't really say what the author wanted them to say. Overall, very shallow. There are many studies out there that are of MUCH better quality."
2,"Potentially useful, but completely useless as a ""vest-buster""","The book is dedicated to coating bullets Teflon for the purpose of (in the case of the bullets, the primary focus of the book) creating the so-called ""cop-killer"" bullets. such bullets are actually made with an iron core, thus allowing them to theoretically pierce Kevlar rather than simply deforming as a lead bullet would (being much less malleable than lead), the Teflon coating was applied solely to reduce friction as the bullet was propelled from the barrel.Teflon, however, is very useful for other applications in which highly reactive substances are being handled and/or minimum friction is called for, which is the only reason for giving this book 2 stars rather than one, though I can honestly say I have no idea whether this procedure would work, and do not recommend it if you're relying on it to save your life in the sort of dramatic and non-probable situation that this book hints towards as being a good reason to buy it."
5,Subwoofer cable,Not much to say about this cable except that it does what it's supposed to do which is more than can be said of the U.S. legislature.
5,"THIS IS ""THE ONE""","THIS IS NO MONSTER CABLE , BUT THE MONSTER I BOUGHT BEFORE THIS ONE GOT MESSED UP REALLY QUICKLY AND SINCE I HAD THIS GREAT CABLE IT HAS DONE AN AWSOME JOB , THIS IS A MUST HAVE IF YOU WANT YOUR SYSTEM TO PERFORM A ITS BEST."
5,Excellant,Works like a charm. Good deal for the sub woofer.....Amazon saved me big bucks over all others
1,dOn'T bUy ThIs MoViE!,"it doesn't get any worse than this. If you are reading this review to decide whether or not to buy it, check out the movie ""The Stuff."" It's on an equally bad level, without the script of a ten year old."
2,Poor Showing,"Movie kept stopping and was not in focus,I wil not be renting anymore movie, I just gave money away that night for a bad experience."
5,The best lesbian movie I've seen in years.,"Nicole Conn is a genius. Her movies and books are so heartfelt and emotional. Everyone can relate to someone in her books and movies. I have watched "" Elena"" several times, making sure I don't miss anything. I can hardly wait for her next film."
5,Great Movie! A must to see!,"The first ever lesbian film that I bought was Claire of the Moon..( same writer/ Nicole Conn)Not that many great ones at that time..and we must have looked at the love scene 100 times..It will be the same with the ''passionate longest kiss '' from Elena Undone. Again, great movie, where we can see the passion/attraction growing between the 2 main characters, even if they're fighting against it.Love can move mountains!Nicely directed, great scenario, great actresses. A great addition to a dvd collection!"
5,"True story, told beautifully","I bought this film after becoming a backer on KickStarter for the next project these talented ladies are doing, ""A Perfect Ending."" I watched it alone first, and found it honest, romantic and beautiful. Then, in a turn of fate I could not have anticipated, I found myself living it and finding my own ""twin flame."" We watched it together twice, and I can say from my own experience that this film captures what it feels like when love hits you between the eyes from a direction you'd have never expected. My beloved says as well that it shows perfectly how it feels to be a straight Christian woman and suddenly find yourself head over heels in love with another woman.Nicole Conn and Marina Rice Bader have a talent for writing, casting and filming that conveys powerful emotions with veracity, compassion and chemistry. I can't wait for ""A Perfect Ending."""
5,Add This To My Favorite Lesbian Movies List,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, so much so, that I have recommended it to all my girlfriends.The ones who I think will have the best experience with Elena Undone are the committed couplesladies."
5,Elena Undone,"Loved this film. Thought the acting was outstanding by the leading ladies. Hard to believe they were ""acting"" since I was convinced they were really in love. The husband ""Barry"" was perfect for the role of the preacher with a problem understanding that its actually possible for people to love someone of the same sex. The son Nash wasn't as convincing playing the role of the son that discovers his mother's little secret. Not sure why the film needed to be set as a documentary versus just letting it play out as a standard movie. Tended to distract from the movie in my opinion. The ending was a different. Not sure why they needed to move forward 6 months and then try to tie up the lose ends. I guess having the ladies walk off into the sunset would be too mundane. The film held my attention. Especially during the scenes involving the two lead characters. This has to be the longest kiss ever in a film. Bravo! Worth the money to buy this DVD and keep it in your library of great Lesbian films."
1,4 and a half stars?? That's nuts.,"This movie was so bad I couldn't even get through it. How in the world anyone can rate this and it garners 4 and half stars is beyond me. I cringed the entire time I watched it. Another horrible endeavor from Nicole Conn. Honestly, how does she get funding for her films? They are SO bloody awful it's beyond words. Stilted storylines, terrible dialogue. Mediocre acting at best. It just all felt so forced. I made it as far as the first kiss and stopped it. I just couldn't even go any further. The kissing was devoid of passion, close lipped. It was bad.Honestly, rent Lip Service from the UK or almost anything else. Avoid Nicole Conn films unless you like to cringe. This is quite possibly THE worst lesbian film I've ever seen...aside from Claire of the Moon, Conn's other film. Yeegads."
5,Great Love Story,"This movie is great for the lesbian woman who is trying to find herself, ealizing that sometimes you can't help who you fall in love with or who you want to be with, its all about being true to yourself"
3,Decent but nothing special,"I had high hopes for this movie but was somewhat disappointed. There is heat between the two characters, but the sub-par production values was distracting, an all too familiar quality with most lesbian love story movies."
3,Uh.....,"So, this movie is pretty weird... I was looking for a good lesbian movie... Rather, a movie with lesbians in it that doesn't fall in the ""adult film"" genre. And this sort of falls in between O.oSo the movie is basically about a priests' wife who falls in love with a photographer. It ends oddly. Won't spoil it.It's weird... Um. Just think: heavy breathing, bad writing, awkward acting, longest kiss in recorded cinema (3 minutes long, seriously), and lots of eye rolls... Yup. That's it. I wouldn't pay to watch this.3 stars because it's a lesbian movie and they tried."
2,Meh...,"I could forgive if this was the directors first attempt but apparently its not? Wow...I'm pretty patient when it comes to independent films and I love 80% of Lesbian films out there, however I was bored, bewildered and bothered ..not in a good way. Borrow from a friend, and see for yourself. Good luck next time."
5,"Beautiful story, beautiful women!","Everyone needs to see this film! There are a few laughs here and there. But, it's the gorgeous women gazing into each other souls that is the best part of this movie. I have never seen this storyline before. Of course, I fantasize about straight women all the time, but this one is different. It's not about being straight or gay, but connecting on a deeper level, regardless of human form.Yeah, it's hot, but after the butterflies in my stomach calm, the story is excellent!Thank you to the film makers and all who were involved."
3,Elena Undone,"The movie was great as far as content and the actress Necar Zadegan was amazing but the movie was continuosly interrupted by narration which I found very annoying. Every romantic scene had background music, therefore you can not here any sounds of kissing, breathing, etc., that you would expect to be in a sex scene."
1,"Would love a great lesbian film, but buyer beware...this is not it!","As one reviewer mentioned, this was shot in 12 days. Believe me, this is no lesbian Scorcese. It feels not only like it was shot in that amount of time but that watching takes that long too. Ponderous, exhausting, cliche-ridden, heavy-handed. I could go on and on and I really don't like giving a bad review to a heart-felt project like this. But if you have an IQ over 12, it's really rough going. Buyer beware unless you're looking for a really bad camp classic."
2,Jim' Review,"I was not happy with the content of the movie or the acting, even though other reviews were more supportive."
4,Good movie,"I think this is a good movie . It truly captures the passion of these 2 women . The sexual tension is crazy, I personally loved it"
4,Reality in some ways,"Good movie. The love between the main characters are believable and well down. The religious husband...... Friendships seem authentic. The son's dilemma was OK, but his girlfriend's perspective was funny and very well acted."
5,Casualties are THE best!,"Alright, I saw the casualties play on Saturday and that was one of the best shows I have been to. This album is pretty good. The live tracks are just soo awesome they blew me away. The cover song ""4q"" is also another great song. If you're just getting into the casualties i highly recommend the old stuff such as early years and for the punx and underground army but this is another good cd! Casualties are a great streetpunk/oi band and I think they are the BEST!"
1,Day 1: Bike Already Broken,"I want to confirm what other reviewers have stated that after 20 minutes of riding this bicycle, it began making knocking clunking sounds.This is incredibly disappointing. I bought this bike based on a consumer reports review and reviews here in Amazon. Don't be fooled. Don't buy this poorly made exercise bicycle."
2,Knees Hit Handlebars,"Easy to put together, works well.The bike is too small for my 6'3"" frame, my knees hit the handlebars even though I have set the seat all the way back and I am riding with the seat too low in an attempt not to have the problem.There should definitely be a height range somewhere in addition to the weight max in the literature."
4,It won't be a valet to hang clothes on,"After being told an exercise bike would be the best thing for my scoped knee, I concluded that this type and brand of exercycle was the best value. After a month of looking at the box, my wife and I took turns trying to construct it. Neither of us follow directions well, so it was a lengthy chore. It is finally operational and I am very pleased with it. I have not yet hung one piece of clothing on it."
4,Good for the price.,"I've been using this bike for about a month and over all I am pleased. The seat is my biggest complaint. I've gotten used to it to a certain degree, but it still bothers me after about 35-40 minutes, even when I'm wearing my biking shorts. My only other complaint is that the construction seems kind of cheap and flimsy in certain ways. I feel like I need to be kind of careful with it, although nothing has broken. The programs are fine, and it is almost silent while riding it. Considering the relatively low price, I think this is a good bike, and I don't regret my purchase."
1,Thought I was getting quality,"I live in a small apartment, and this seemed like a perfectly small exercise bike.This thing looked good, and the Schwinn name was a plus. Everything was going great during assembly, but I noticed that the wiring for the heart monitoring probes was broken. I thought I could live with it, but what I couldn't live with was the knocking noise that came with each revolution. This all happened during the first 30 minutes of operation. Pedaling also feels kind of choppy. It is all very annoying.The bike doesn't feel solid, and is a bit wobbly. Construction is flimsy, and it doesn't look like Schwinn went with a quality contractor. Even the ""SCHWINN QUALITY"" logo seal is falling off.I have used Schwinn exercise machines at the local gym and have been very happy with them. I guess I have to pay a little more for the privilege of a trouble free exercise bike. I will definitely be getting rid of this thing."
1,Piece of junk,"Don't buy a schwinn bike. We bought this one, put it together but couldn't get it to turn on. We called Schwinn and they sent us a new power jack and wire (lost a week waiting for it) and those pieces didn't work either. Boxed this baby up and sent it back. We actually tried buying the Schwinn 140 after and it kept turning off every ten minutes - then died within 3 days."
4,Schwinn 130 Upright Exercise Bike,"Delivery was on schdule and the packing OK. I had no problems assembling the bike. In my opinion it is well built and feels solid.The seat adjustment works but leaves a lot to be desired. The seat is uncomfortable, but that seems to be the case with all of these units.I think it sets a bit high, but perhaps that is desirable for a very tall person.I like the operation of the unit - it is very quiet and stable.I do think they should have made the readout more visible - I keep a flashlight handy.Overall, I like it."
1,Disappointed,"Just received my Schwinn today via UPS. When I saw the condition the box was in I should have been prepared. The box was already partially opened and obviously had been damaged in shipping. I opened the top of box and noticed immediately that the pipe that accepts the seat stem was cracked. I did not even unpack the remaining contents in the box. I am very disappointed the way this product was shipped and I am still unsure whether I will trust another shipment of this type - should have paid closer attention to other comments, but I was hoping that AMAZON would take care of the problem by now - Guess not!"
4,great for the bucks,great bike for the money...for a big guy ..no.....for regular height and weight very good....quite...good value......
2,Schwinn 130 upright,"I tried several bikes and decided on this one because of the programs and it was quiet. The box we got was very tore up. There was no paperwork with the bike. We got the bike assembled and it is still very quiet, however that is because I rarely use it. I have tried numerous adjustments and my knees or hips crack because I cannot get it adjusted correctly. The seat is either too high or too low. I have never had an issue with cracking of the knees or hips. I had my husband try it and his knees also crack, regardless of the seat adjustment. There is something very wrong with this design."
4,Schwin Upright- so far so good,I feel like I'm riding my bike... It has the ride of a more expensive trainer. I hope that it holds up.
5,Could not put it down,A wonderful modern day adventure that explains the woes of African countries with honest humor.
1,Junk.,Had no luck using this product. Followed the instructions and even my faint thin body hair would come back at it's natural rate.Lame :(
3,Its an Air Filter,Nothing bad to say. Its an air filter that I needed and It came on time at a decent price..... I'll buy again.
2,Too much of the same thing,"This was a mistake. It's interesting to hear various versions of a beautiful piece but after awhile, it gets a little boring. Sorry."
1,Dumb!,"This film is a dumb and sleazy, trying to make people think they are buying Richard Elfman's Forbidden Zone, which this film is not!"
3,Guilty pleasure,"A guilty pleasure, I confess my relatively high rating for this sexy flick (calling it soft-core maybe a bit too much, since there is not that much nudity in it) cannot be explained or defended in a rational way. Five beautiful babes in a sauna, as they describe their somewhat similar fantasies, slowly realize they have been abducted by a not too handsome alien in the past. Shot in Romania, the cast includes centerfold Pia Reyes but the one who gets more screen time is the unknown blonde Meredyth Holmes, who is really very beautiful. The unknown redhead (probably a Romanian) is really beautiful, too."
2,"Lots of skin and no real plot, this is not a date movie .","This shot in Romania cheapie from Charles Band's Full Moon company (this was made before his Surrender Cinema producing arm began pumping them out fast and furious) is about three women who discover their most memorable erotic dreams actually occured on the night the trio's car broke down (or did it???) on a trip they were taking. Three dreamlike ""erotic stories"" follow. None of them make any real sense until the end, and even then it really isn't worth the effort of sitting through the movie to find out. Seeing the sets for Oblivion (a ""major"" Full Moon Production) recycled yet again (they were also used for another soft core epic called Petticoat Planet) produces a chuckle and a nod of admiration for Band's Cormanlike desire to save as much money as possible. Not enough bang for the buck."
2,Disappointed,Was disappointed with this figures. 1st of all the color of the jersey is wrong. It was pictured as white but the one I received was grey. 2nd the figure will not fit onto the stand and the stick will not fit into the hole on the figure.
1,Style no Substance,"If you want something that looks kinda cool on your counter, you have come to the right coffee maker. Want a good cup of coffee? Buy something else. I was hoping beyond hope that this would make a great cup of coffee. I was dissapointed. I am not a coffee snob, and I can handle pretty much any java around, but this was a low point for my tastebuds."
4,Over a year and still happy,"I've had mine for over a year and use it about 5 times a week.The only problem I've had is finding the pods in stores.I have to order online but there are plenty of brands, flavors and options out there so far so I'm satisfied.I love the look of this machine, the ease of use and size.It sits on my desk at work and I get lots of compliments and the occasional guest who stops by to enjoy a cup.In my opinion, this is a quality product."
3,Just 'OK',"I find the plastic water resevoir to be very difficult to get in and out. No one else has mentioned this, so perhaps it is just my machine. Since it is not a strong plastic, when filled with water, there is some chance of spillage when trying to lock the container into the machine. As someone mentioned, it is much cheaper looking up close than in the pictures. Has anyone tried the Keurig? And, do try to coffee from Podhead; definitely superior!"
3,"Easy to use, not the best coffee","The machine is very easy to use and very convienent, however, the coffee is OK. I'm a coffee lover and really enjoy different beans. This machine you are limited to certain several types and it's not quite strong enough for my taste. I'll still use it week days when I'm dashing out the door and don't want to mess with my french press or drip machine."
2,"Looks Cool, but the Coffee is Quite Horrible","Yes, quite a cool little item to sit on the countertop, and how excited I was when I took it out of the box. How simple! How fun! How like a little Red Rocket that will deliver my morning goodness! How sad I was when I took my first sip. Sub-par beans and bean handling is all I can say. Diner coffee at best, and I've tried every different ""pod"" at both strengths. Bad, bad coffee. So, now I'm sharing my kitchen with boxes of darkest roast, (Buzzworthy) pods. What to do? Avoid it, or pray that they hook up with a roasting company that knows what the hell they're doing."
3,Java One - Yes and No,"I love the way this coffee machine works. I love being able to do one quick cup at a time, I like that we can all choose our own flavors. It works just as promised - quick and simple. A little larger footprint than I would like - wanted to put it on my desk at work but a little too big. I like the tea, but I'm disappointed to say (and I am NOT a coffee expert - like plain old regular coffee) I agree with others - the coffee doesn't taste good. I don't know if it's because it doesn't really steep, or if it is the coffee, but I too was wishing I could try different brands. It tastes bitter and burned to me and I've found myself not using it already within 2 weeks. Same with my daughter. I think if Melitta can work out these kinks, it is super - I'm going to keep it and wait for some improvements...in the meantime, bought another coffee maker that allows me to make better tasting coffee."
2,disappointing,Coffee isn't really hot. Only makes an 8 oz. cup which is about half the size a regular person is used to making. Noisy and odd looking.
4,A New Twist for an Old Pod,"I bought the One:One coffeemaker for my studio. Before purchasing this model, I tried the Black & Decker pod coffeemaker and the design was cumbersome to say the least. You couldn't lift the pod holder out very well, and then you had to work to get it down in the pod chamber to lock it closed. The Melitta was a better design in this respect.Before making a cup of coffee in the One:One, I primed it 3 times and haven't noticed any puddling around the base or any leaking as other guests have experienced with their coffeemakers. I did try the Melitta coffees and they all tasted like vending machine coffee. (I have not tried any of the teas.)Since I am limited to pods in my area, I decided to try the Folger's pods and they will fit the pod holder if you squish them down into the pod holder. You can get a 5 oz. and 8oz. cup of coffee out of one pod.I am pretty pleased with the One:One pod maker and my friends will experience a fresher cup of coffee as they drop in to visit."
2,"Functions well, terrible coffee","I tried this machine and followed the instructions for priming it. I didn't have any problems with leakage and I got an eight ounce cup of coffee by punching the four ounce button a second time. The machine functioned well, coffee was ready in under a minute and it was the right temperature for my taste. However, the coffee tasted terrible; it had a metal taste. I tried several brands of pods, and they all tasted like metal. All the pods worked well and I even used regular coffee grounds in a regular filter which I folded to fit in the pod holder. I didn't get a good cup of coffee in spite of all my efforts, so I took it back to the store and got my money back."
3,Ok Coffee maker...lousy coffee,I would like to be able to create my own pods to use with this...unfortunately they don't have the means to do it and you have to buy their coffee...yech....tastes like Juan Baldez's donkey stepped on the beans before they roasted them.... so I'm going to have to figure out a way to do it on my own...so if my experimenting with creating my own pods doesn't work I'll have to scrap the machine for a real one...
1,Horrible Tasting Coffee,"Well I was so excited to read about this new concept coffee maker. I did a little research and decided to purchase one. I did and brought it home, read the directions, primed the machine according to instructions and made my first cup of Java. It didn't even fill my mug. I thought something was wrong...it wasn't that was all it was programmed to make. The coffee was very bitter and tasted somewhat like paper. So I decided that the machine need to have some water ran through it to clean it. I did that several times and made another cut. The coffee still had the same awful taste. It's going back to the store. The product is NOT at all what I expected."
1,Sending it back immediately,"It should have said in big bold letters that you can only use ""PODS"" in this coffee maker. Granted it is called a pod coffee maker (& I may be an idiot for not knowing what that meant) but I wasn't expecting to have to special order very expensive coffee that is shaped like little frisbees just to have my morning cup. All I want is a bag of coffee & a coffee filter. Having to use these little pods greatly limits the selection of coffees you can choose to drink."
4,CARICIA,"ACHO QUE A MUSICA E' UMA LINGUAGEM UNIVERSAL, E SEM DUVIDA ALGUMA O TRABALHO SENSUAL,COM A SERIEDADE E SIMPATIA JUNTO COM A MARAVILHOSA VOZ DA CANTORA FAZEM DESSE CD CERTAMENTE UMA NOVIDADE BONITA DEMAIS PARA OS AMANTES DA ARTE CANORA... VALEU OLGA SERGIO"
3,Important book - but NOT 100% accurate...,"Inge Scholl tells this story as an outsider, the sister of two members of the White Rose - NOT as an active participant. The reader must remember Inge Scholl told this story after-the-fact and had no knowledge of the events as they took place. Her memories which are told in this book are just that - her memories - and are not always 100% accurate. Several other books have been written which are far more in-depth and accurate, but this slim volume remains a favorite among teachers and students wishing to learn more. If you purchase this book - and you should - please follow up with additional resources. This shouldn't be the only source of facts regarding The White Rose."
4,"An eloquent, albeit brief, summary of theWhite Rose","Seldom has an Introduction been so inappropriate as that which accompanies this edition of Inge Scholl's eloquent, albeit brief history of the White Rose. Do not be put off by the Marxist tirade which, inexplicably, appends an otherwise straightforward and unpretentious telling of one of our century's great and tragic stories. One wishes there were more personal detail in Inge's tribute to her brother and sister, who were executed by the Nazis during the darkest days of Germany's descent into Hell. Scholl's major contribution is to guard the memory of her slain siblings and their idealistic movement from misappropriation by latter-day ideological partisans, ironically best typified by this volume's unfortunate axe-grinding Introduction."
3,Will Read More on This,I had always wanted to read about this facet of the war. The book had the right amount of detail in giving an overall picture of the group.
4,Riveting Exposé but Unbalanced,"I was glued to Mel White's exposé of the inner sanctum of America's Christian Right. His writing is superb and his knowledge is expansive. However, his excessive discussion of fundamentalism's front against homosexuality make the book unbalanced. Moreover, it seems he sometimes exaggerates and states conjecture as fact in order to make his point. For example, he states that a chaplain (MeLinda Morton) at the center of a recent controversy at the Air Force Academy was the academy's ""chief chaplain,"" when she was actually a junior chaplain there. He also states as fact that she was fired from her position, while the academy claims her position change was part of normal position rotations. Other likely occurances of hyperbole occur throughout the book. Still, even with my complaints, this book's unique depth and insight into fundamentalism's influence in American piety lead me to strongly recommend it."
1,Disappointed!,"I guess I should have known it would be political. But somehow I thought being by Mel White, whose first book ""Stranger At the Gate"" was super, it was disappointing."
1,Still Clueless,After decades of diatribe Mel White still doeen't get it. He sees evangelical Christians as his enemies and doesn't realize they hate the sin but love the sinner. The only source I can see for his continual attacks on believers is a guilty conscience. I would sugget that anyone pray for Mel.
4,Paddy is great,"We all know he can sing and this is a good disc of some of his better known hits, the quality is good and well worth a listen."
5,A true titanic work,"AP Maudslay here produces this truly classic, titanic work. He lived at and cleared much of the mayan sites where he did his extensive work. Volumes of beautiful photographs and incredible linedrawings accompany his observations. He was truly one of the great mayan pioneers. I am very happy to see that this century old major work is available and at a very reasonable price! This great work is a wonder to behold and, even at this rather hefty price any serious mayanist shoud procure this as soon as possible while its still available! ALAN J kANE"
5,NICE PRODUCT,"THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. IT FITS UNDER MY WELDING HOOD AND OFFERS MUCH BETTER QUALITY, DURABILITY AND FUME PROTECTION THAN THE CHEAPER PAPER DUST MASKS."
4,Great (supervised) project for little kids,I bought two kits and spent an afternoon putting them together with 3 young ladies ranging in age from 4-11. I'm not sure which of them enjoyed it more - they all had a good time. I left them to paint it on their own and they had even more fun.
1,This feeder couldn't support the weight of a bird!,"This was to have been a gift for my nephew. When the product arrived, I could tell by the size of the box that it was unacceptable as a gift for anyone.I assembled the kit myself in about 5 minutes and was very glad I didn't give it to anyone. The ""feeder"" would have held only about two tablespoons of seeds. SO SAD. I left it sitting on my coffee table until my cat knocked it off and it fell apart. The nails wouldn't even hold in the soft wood!A real waste of money. I ordered another kit from another Amazon provider that was about the same price and just perfect for my nephew. So glad I did!"
3,Kinda flimsy.,"I needed to use better heavier nails, as the tiny ""pins"" provided made the construction weak. Smaller than I anticipated. I don't recall the dimensions being stipulated in the catalog."
4,I bought this for my grandchildren,"Perfect project for kids keep them busy all day! I would recommend this for entertaining small kids, but the paint can be a mess, so be careful"
2,Not for an adult,"We appreciated promptly receiving the bird feeder kit, but were disappointed in it for our application as adults. I'm sure that we should have figured this out from the description, so the disappointment is largely our own fault. I would think that a child would enjoy making the feeder, and be satisfied with the results."
2,A Poor Man's In Flames,"While being a fan of melodic death metal, I was very disappointed in Rock Hell. It is a cheesey, poorly executed album chock full of happy majors and tasteless song-writing. I'm also a fan of clean vocals in extreme metal, but the cleans on this CD are laughable half of the time. I can give Gandalf credit for being tight and having some interesting rhythms, but aside from that, I'd recommend checking out In Flames Clayman (a pretty bad album, in its own right) before this.-l-"
1,Hahaha,"My guess as to how this album came about:The guitarist: Dude... I've been listening to a bunch of COB lately, we should like... totally rip off their style (inhales dope)...The drummer: Yeah duuude totally (puffs weed)... we should like be really catchy but like... (puffs weed) try to cover up the fact that we're terrible songwriters duude.The other guitarist that has no contribution to the band: Yeah, man (inhales dope)... let's pretend that we don't hire people to tune our guitars...(puff)The bassist: I quitThe singer: Me too."
5,True Stella Award,"An awesome book. Last year I bought a copy for myself, and then one for my step dad for Christmas!! He really thought the book was informative and thought provoking. Keep up the good work, Randy.From a loyal This is True Premium reader!"
3,Can't get past the title,"Stella Lieback was seriously injured -- nearly killed -- by corporate malfeasance. When I teach business law, or ethics, I use her case, and the students always agree after study that she didn't collect enough, and that McDonalds should have protected customers before the case, and that McDonalds conducted the case in a most egregious way.Because the book has a title that slams a badly-injured, elderly lady, every time I pick the book up I worry that similar misreporting dogs each story, each case.Stella was injured. She was neither a greedy opportunist, nor a filer of a frivolous lawsuit. If the law ran amok in that case, it was in failing to pay Ms. Lieback what she was owed, or what would have changed the corporation's harmful behaviors.I hope I'm wrong, but I keep choking on the title of the book."
5,Fantastic,"This is one of the best books I've read. I get Randy Cassingham's emails, but I really like having it all in one volume and being able to buy it for my family and friends. On the surface, it's an amusing book, but when it sinks in that these are real cases, it becomes mildly alarming. It's very well organized and Randy picked some great cases to put in the book."
2,Not well constructed,"I bought this DVD because I was very excited about the Christian aspect to it. However, I didn't feel like it wasn't made in a way that was cute for babies. It was actually kind of boring for my my little one and that's too bad. If you are looking for a Christian oriented baby video, I would try the Baby Miracle line which is very musical and seems more interesting and even educational."
1,This is the worst baby video.,"I have seen lots of baby/toddler videos over the years and this is the worst one. It coud not hold the attention of my 6-month-old baby nor my 2-year-old son. The songs were ok, but that does not make up for the lack of value everywhere else."
2,Not pleasing to baby,"While this DVD has good music on it, I found that it could not hold the baby's attention. Also, the animation was a bit too much for the child. The content was no substantive enough unfortunately."
4,nice stuff,"i saw this guy play at the 2006 earth day festival in cincinnati. its pretty mellow stuff, with some upbeat songs interspersed. My personal favorites are ""vespa girl"", ""something's gotta give"", and the title track, ""portrait of narcissus"".this cd is worth checking out if you like wilco or ryan adams."
1,How investors can MAKE MONEY using...MASS PSYCHOLOGY,I found Mr. Dines book to be big on price and small on continuity and meaning. The text moves in and out of ideas so quickly that it is difficult to decipher any point to his many colorful stories. His personal philosophies don't really teach you much in the end. I would not recommend the book to anyone hoping to learn more about investing.
5,Excelente Libro,Recomiendo este libro al que quiera conocer el por que de invertir en oro y plata. El libro ofrece una ayuda a todo aquel que quiera saber las causas de la actual crisis financiera.
4,Crime Solvers,"""Missing Pieces"" by Jerry B. Jenkins & Chris Fabry is the first book I've read from their young readers collection. It was a very quick read. Twins (brother & sister) have a detective bone in their body and love to solve mysteries. This particular story had 2 mysteries going on. Bryce had one to solve and Ashley was working on one. Bryce is working on figuring out who's been smashing mailboxes. He thinks he has it all figured out until he finds other evidence. Ashley, in the meantime, is trying to help the lunch lady find her missing daughter who was supposedly killed in an apartment fire. Mrs. Garcia never believed her baby was killed because there was never any evidence of a body found. It was interesting and perfect for any reader who is in to reading larger chapter books."
4,A great book!,"This is a great book because it tells about the life on a kibbutz. It tells a story of a girl named Aviva, she has a problem though she has a piano and doesn't know how to get it in her house."
5,Feels great on!,"I am very pleased with this product. It works really well and does not leave a sticky residue on your lips. It seems to be a good enough product, although I don't really feel the smell of vanilla, it has a honey smell. Good price."
2,Goodbye fast internet connection.,"The first message I received repeatedly after installing was ""Internet Explorer is attempting to access the internet"" >_< Another disapointment among antivirus/firewall programs. It works well at blocking intrusion attempts but the configuration is horrid and it has slowed my connection way down. It does what it claims to do but does it at the expense of your connection speed. I'd hate to see what it does to a dial up connection."
1,No kiss mascara,"I would not buy this product again. Although it comes off reasonably easily, I did feel that I lost some of my eyelashes...and I need to keep as many as I can. My eyelashes felt very stiff once the product had dried. This meant that they kept their curl, however I like to remove all my makeup at night and I found removal of the mascara somewhat time consuming."
4,"If you have allergies, this might be the solution","I couldn't wear mascara previously. I don't wear it every day but even an occasional use caused redeye and itching and burning. This does not. It's worth trying. And it doesn't make lashes ridiculously long or icky, clumped and sodden looking. Gives just enough oomph."
3,Please Stop The Music!,"The tape is quite informative but as one of the previous commenters suggested, quite basic. Perhaps a good solid introduction. My complaint is with the format of the tape. The music selected for the tape could not be more melancholy and depressing. It was entirely the wrong choice and will drive parents, who are already worried about their kids, into despair. In addition, there are points were the music is used for transition and it goes on entirely too long. Final comment, for getting one cassette tape, the price is much too [spendy]."
4,Incredible Value for an Incredible Speaker.,"Incredible Sound Quality. I have gone though several Center Channel Speaker from Cerwin Vega to Advents and this one has to be the best I have heard. JBL are known for quality and this product is an example of their work. The 3/4"" tweeter provides a crips and outstanding high range vocals with no distortion, unlike previous center speakers I have owned in the past. The Dual 5"" midrange cones also give give depth to most situations that occur in whatever movie you may be watching. The blockbuster movies that are on dvd do sound fantastic with this speaker, not tinny or hollow but full, rich and animated. Not to mention the newest DTS titles coming up! Jurassic Park will be a reference quality disc to try on this speaker, that is certain. This is one of the best speakers I have owned. The price can't be beat either. All I can say is the combination of price and great quality in design and sound of this speaker just can not be beat. This is a must have."
5,SUCCESS IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER,Excellent book because it shows what success means to many different individuals. It is a most insightful book and is a great aid to people who have been downsized from their jobs. I recommend it also to people struggling to find their mission in life. A worthy book to have on ones mantle.
2,Not satisfied,"I bought this for my parents for Christmas last year and it has not been what they hoped it would be. They wanted to record records and tapes to CD, and preferably make mixed CDs as well. I don't think we could do that but even more important, the CDs it burnt didn't play in their stereo CD player, OR one of their car CD players. Bad luck perhaps? I know this is a common issue that requires trial and error however their burnt CDs from computer worked fine everywhere. Also I tried different blank media with the Teac to no avail."
2,missing what I need!,I liked the machine and used it but I am replacing it with the Sony version.The one thing that the Sony does is a 2 second fade in and out. I can't believe I missed this in the reviews. Back to the Sony I use to have with all it's quirks. It is a deal breaker for me to not be able to auto fade in/out.
3,Wasn't what I expected,"The RW880 unit is not that great. We used a pack of discs just to get familar with it. I for no reason it skips a track or to while recoring. This means start all over from the beginning.It is built well, just not what I expected"
4,"Easy, easy, easy!","I was scared off of the Sony recorder by the customer reviews, and by noticing the high number of those units listed on eBay as refurbished. I've only been using the Teac for a short time, but I find it extremely easy to use. I've been using TDK music cd's and have had no problems whatsoever. I purchased this unit to convert all of my lp's to cd format. I only wish the recorder had the capability to sense the end of one lp song and start a new track on the cd before recording the next lp song. Overall, I'm very happy with this recorder. My lp's sound great on cd."
1,Door for CD did not open.,When the product arrived I plugged it in and the door for inserting the |CD did not open. I returned the product for a refund.
4,Teac TD-CDRW880,"Just got this unit and have used it to record CD's and many LP's already. Works best in the manual mode. Very nice unit, it has everything I wanted and is fairly simple to operate. Produces great CD's from LP's. The unit itself is 5 stars but the remote sucks with dinky little buttons that don't always activate the machine when pushed even up close. Why they put out such a crappy remote with this fine unit is a dumb move on their part. I use the buttons on the machine and it works fine that way. I would rec this recorder to anyone as an addition to their existing system. It's priced right and is a winner. Only the remote keeps it from being 5 stars."
5,Great Machine Teac RW880,"This Teac CD recorder is a great machine for the money. If you need a analoge cd recorder its easy to use easy to connect. I bought it to record my over 4000 LP records on to cd to put in my computer to put on my MP3 players and I love it, You will too!"
4,Teac CD Recorder,"The Teac CD Recorder is easy to use. I have been making audio CD's from 33LP records so I can transport the music through my iPod. All recorders, to my best knowledge, record a record as one tract or song not realizing that the pause between songs is a separation in the music. It interpretes the pause as a quiet portion of a song. So, while in a recording mode all you have to do is push the record button once after each song and a new track number is assigned to the next song. Now you can download the music to iTunes and enter the song names for each tract."
5,Must have for a musik lover,This is a high quality device for cerating CDs from LPs and making compillations. It is easy to operate and has many useful features. It would be better if it also had an optical out. The limitations which are there are not in the device but in the fact that digital copy are usually blocked at the source. However analog copies are always allowed.
4,Excellent Product,"I am using the CD-RW880 primarily to make CDs from vinyl. The RW880 does a very fine job of this. It is easy to use, although the manual could be clearer. The auto track feature that is supposed to automatically place track breaks onto the CD before/after songs does not work when converting LPs to CDs. However, track breaks can easily be put in manually. Sound quality is excellent, the sound that goes in is the sound that comes out. Overall, the RW880 get high marks. The only reason that the RW880 did not get 5 stars is that I have only had the machine for a month and can not comment on longevity."
2,Brenda's Studio Recorder.,9/26/10 I have found out since the purchase that this unit has COPY-RIGHT protection. So if you want to make more than one copy to give to you're friends forget this unit.
2,Picky with CD-R Audio Media,Had to Return because of playback error on too many brands of CD media. Unit looks professional and worked everytime with Maxell media. Never worked with MAM-A or Memorex media. Would not play some disks burned on a computer. Going to buy the $599 unit from Tascam to get around the SCMS limitations. Amazon took my return with no problem so far.
2,Power at a cost,"The inverter supplies power, but at a cost. The cooling fan seems to be a huge draw on the DC power source(battery) if left connected for an extended period. In addition the power provided has such a bad shape(the modified sine wave) that most devices make a humming or crackling type of noise. I was unable to use this inverter to power the following due to the noise : an outlet strip, a computer monitor(flat lcd), a tv(flat lcd), a stereo, a dvd player, a vcr, or computer speakers.Most battery chargers warn against ever plugging into an inverter, so I didn't even try anything like that.I have been able to plug in lights(normal bulbs and low watt)."
1,Defective Unit?,I used the 400 watt unit (800 watt peak) on a box fan rated at 250 watts. The fan barely spun on low and buzzed and after about 30 seconds and then inverter failed in a puff of smoke. Returned the unit and got a second unit with the same result. I guess these units are not good for a box fan even if rated to handle it.
3,Good for non-programmers,"If you want to learn Flash MX without a large emphasis on ActionScript, this would be an ok selection. If you are looking for information on creating animations with ActionScript instead of tweening, then don't get this book. It's well written, but fairly basic."
5,A mandatory text.,"Your lovely book, Perception and Imaging, is now a mandatory text in our combined media course, ""Concepts, Theories and Production."" We will use it in both the digital as well as the photography parts of the course."
1,An Academic Treatise,"I'll keep this review short and sweet. This book is an in-depth academic discussion of how humans see and perceive things. Although there were some interesting tid-bits throughout the book, I wanted to learn how to improve the composition of my photographs, and didn't find anything of use. This book is probably well-suited to a graduate-level psychology course, but for me it has little applicability to photography."
1,This is not a Photography book,Read the reviews. This is not a photography book. It is a book on psychology. As a photographer I give this 1 star. This may very well be a good psychology book.
4,A humorous take on life with cats (and without men),"Pages full of reason after reason that cats are better than men, complete with illustrations. Quite amusing."
2,Good cable; Good price...but,"I have owned my Belkin HDMI for about 6 months. In the past few weeks, I have noticed that the cable is falling out of the TV socket! Since it is mounted perfectly horizontal, I can only assume the cause to be all the excess weight of the very well insulated cable. I wonder if the even higher priced cables, with their ""super"" insulation have the same problem. Since HDMI is supposedly the BEST connection, why don't manufacturers insure a good connection with thumb screws or snaps at connections like computer manufacturers? ...just a thought! Anyway, I'm now using my cable providers' very light, vinyl clad HDMI, with just as good viewing results!"
4,your device may not really be HDMI ready,"I bought the HDMI cable to connect Vip211 HD satelite receiver and Philips LCD HDTV. At first it had picture but no sound. After live unplug/plug, I got sound. Turn off TV then turn on sometime later, TV does not even know the receiver. Searching internet forum, I found a lot of complaints on Vip211 receiver over the last 6 months. Seems devices always talk over analog link, but often not talk over digital link. 6 months is not long enough for a manufacturer to fix HDMI interface problem. I'd suggest wait if you can, since HDMI is not mature enough."
1,Outdated information,"I bought this DVD as a gift for my husband, a Bermuda fanatic. Imagine our disappointment at the clothing, hair styles and music from the early eighties. The release date as a DVD is 2/2004 so I felt quite mislead. Many of the restaurants, stores and clubs featured haven't been in business for years, and so much of what's fun to do in Bermuda now is not represented, such as Dolphin Quest, the beautiful Aquarium, and the glass blowing and rum cake factories and craft market you can visit in The Royal Naval Dockyard. I want a refund."
1,Reads like a dull episode of CSI: Sweden,"The plodding murder investigation that makes up the heart of this mystery reads like a low-energy, drawn-out episode of CSI: Sweden. Not even the Scandinavian setting could draw much interest out of the story. I found the main character, a 40-something detective at a cross-roads in life, stock and uninteresting; interweaving his personal life into the investigation into a gruesome double homicide didn't add much other than to the heft of the 400-page novel. Top it all off with a glaringly poor English translation.The subtitle of Sun and Shadow is ""An Erik Winter Novel,"" implying there are others that follow in a series. I'll pass."
1,Terribly Disappointed!,"This is the first book I have read by Ake Edwardson, and it certainly will be my last. I love to read Henning Mankell thrillers and wanted to try another mystery by a Swedish author. Near the end, I thought it was going to get interesting, but it never did. Sorry I couldn't say something nice about it! Maybe it just didn't translate well into English!The jacket of the book said Edwardson is ""one of Scandinavia's most successful crime writers."" I don't think he can hold a candle to Mankell!"
2,As suspenseful as a Bugs Bunny cartoon,"The reviews of this book mistakenly describe it as suspenseful. It isn't. Suspense is not what I call periodic action interspersed with page after page of meandering prose. Perhaps I should be more respectful of Edwardson's descriptive passages on the death of Winter's father or his introspection preceding the birth of his first child, but they are page filling without contribution to the story. And poor Patrik, the young paper boy, who is set up to be a critical factor in the solution of the mystery only to be left completely out of the ending. Speaking of the ending, its hard to see how any of the police procedures described in the book have much to do with the end result. With only pages left, SURPRISE, one suspect simply leads Winter to the culprit.I'm as much disappointed in the people who gave this book rave reviews as I am i the author."
5,Spastic Freakishly Operatic Fun,This is a fine example of a great band's too few releases. The Figshta Diaries has some amazing depths of sound as well as emotion. Don't let the butt fetishism or goofy lyrics fool you. This can be profound stuff.
2,Not satisfied at all...,"Before buying this system, I read some reviews at audioreview.com, where some people detected problems with the magnetic shielding of the N-center speaker. I didn't pay attention to that and tried my speaker at house...surprise....when I placed my center speaker on the top of my tv set, the upper corners turned violet. People, this speaker has serious problems with magnetic shielding, and I don't recommend it if you're going to use it in the top of your tv. Believe me, and I'm not first victim. I had to raise my speaker about 7 cm above my tv set, to solve the problem. (I was not supposed to do that, you neither).Sonically, the system is great, but don't forget adding a good subwoofer. Good blend."
3,"No bass, very clear","I use the N24s for surround in my home theater and the N Center as my center channel speaker. The center speaker delivers very accurate speech and is very clear. The N24s are great for surrounds, but they are lacking for front speakers. I use the N38s for the fronts. These speaker will provide very little bass, so movies will not be that spectacular. You are better off buying everything seperate since you don't get a great price discount by buying this ""system"" which will just actually be all the speaker seperate."
5,Baghdad libraries in the 800's,"In addition to a treatment of the scholar/author of the title, Toorawa descibes the plethora of libraries and bookshops open to the public in 9th c. Baghdad. Amazing portrait of intellectual circles and the spread of all kinds of literature at a time when Europe's written materials seem to have been confined primarily to Christian works in the hands of only the most wealthy of the elite and to monasteries. A fine contribution to Islamic Studies and to global intellectual history."
3,"A Disappointing Album, Lacking Focus and Depth","On this album, Heidi Berry departs from the dark brooding beauty of her earlier works. She seems to be searching for a different sound, but isn't successful at it. On some songs she leans towards the Celtic and Medieval, while on others she sounds almost Country-Western, but the songs themselves meander without much focus, and the album as a whole seems to search for a theme without getting anywhere. It seems she released this collection of songs for the sole purpose of releasing another album, rather than making a piece of art.This is a bitter disappointment if you're a fan of her previous albums. Her voice really shines when placed against the right instruments and in the right songs, and unfortunately, this album doesn't do that. With a little more work, this album could have been much better."
3,Not terribly impressed.,"I guess it depends on what you are looking for and how much other, similar, material you have read as to how you would value this book. I have read many books on the topic of demons, as well as listened to many tapes available on the subject. To me the book was interesting, but not terribly impressive. Again, some might find it helpful, however, depending on their particular needs. The author has her interesting opinions, but I would say don't consider her to be infallible, or even comprehensive."
4,"Excellent. Only a true, tragic story can be like this.","It's an odyssey of a dedicted communist and a patriotic pole, who was slowly becoming disilusioned about the system.The book despite its fairly plain language shows the true picture of pre-WW2 Poland, of German attrocities during the War and of a communist reality thereafter.It is also compelling story of a tragic life of the statesman, whose father and son commited suicide, who struggled to preserve his family and whose ideas were totaly discredited on the end.I reccomend it with all my heart."
5,La Diva Gal Costa,"This album and it's accompanying DVD is the epitome of Brazilian music at it's finest. I was fortunate to see this concerto when I was in Sao Paulo. Gal is inarguably the premiere female vocalist of her era. In many ways Classico, in other ways adventurous leading the Tropicalia movement with Caetano Veloso and others.With less than a few hours to perfect her set before a knowing audience, Gal sweeps you away to Leblon in Ipanema. Songs as popular as ""Baby"" or ""London, Londontown"" are interspersed with new songs from novo artisto braziliero making this a very exciting endeavor.This is MTV's Unplugged series with top of the line musicians. Bravissimo to our Brazilian artists.She closes out with a final appearance on top of one of the favelas in Janiero."
3,Great Ratings - Can't Get to Work for Me,I have read and read about these products and how well they work for people. I can't say they have done anything for me. Packaging is very nice. Product seems to be a quality presented product. Just hasn't done anything for me.
4,An EXCELLENT effort.,"I really like this album a lot. ""mojo"" hit it right on the head - there is a sense of urgency and kinetic spirit here that really comes through the speakers. And the musicianship is very deceiving - there is a lot more going on than meets the ear. I would compare it to early Talking Heads, a little Iggy, a little Devo, even a little Clash perhaps... but a very unique, refreshing sound. I hope they continue to mine their instincts... they are terrific. And the singing is great. Very cool synchopation at times also. Buy this album!"
3,Gettin' lost in the garage.,"The ABO gets through almost 40 minutes on this album with only a few chords, some loud guitars, plently of reverb, and lots of energy and VU-esque menace. 10 songs of leather-jacket bombast with little melodic content, followed by a haunting little acoustic number. I would have liked some of the sensitivity and melody of ""Harp for my Sweetheart"" injected into a few of the other songs, but as it is, it lies fairly well next to that new album by The Duke Spirit and other back-to-basics rock droners. Some of the songs make you want to drink beer and shoot pool and think about getting in a fight, some make you want to do all of the above but consider it a spiritual experience."
2,Didnt like it,"I'm a big fan of puzzle games, but this one just didn't appeal to me. The games got boring after a few repetitions. It needed more skill levels between easy and ""normal"". And what was up with the backgrounds? Seriously, the flashing animation and things zipping back and forth in the background was really distracting and annoying, not to mention a genuine seizure risk for susceptible people. Buy Tetris for the DS instead."
4,Girlfriend loves it,I bought this game for my girlfriend since she's addicted to bejeweled. She loves this game and took over my DS for a solid week after getting it.
3,Not What I thought it was going to be.,"I thought it was going to have multiple varieties of games to play, instead it was the same concept through out. It was not what I expected it was going to be so I was disappointed. I play it sometimes but get bored with it easily."
4,Good overall puzzle game,"I'll start off saying that I picked up this game on a whim (on sale for $20), and in the end I got a bit more than I expected. The game mechanics are easy to learn, but there are enough advance techniques to keep the game interesting. I like the different modes (Puzzle, Daily Play, Endless, etc.), because again it adds to the re-play value. Wireless is also a big plus. I have two boys that love the DS, so we play a lot of wirelss. It is easy to handicap each player based on ability, so we have great fun playing together. I won't call it a 5-star game, because it still can't stand up to some other well known puzzle games (I'm talking about you, Tetris). But, I will say that I keep coming back for more. I've had is for a month now, and it is still my most frequent play."
1,Terrible!,"BORING! I got this for my 10 year old daughter, she brought it back to me after 30 minutes and told me she didn't want it anymore. I tried it and after a few minutes I turned the game off. It is confusing to start a puzzle and is just plain boring."
4,Kudos to the underrated...,"This is one of the most underrated Albert Brooks films of all time. It is his early work so it is quite sparse technically (sound quality and sets are bare and in some cases, barely there) but the premise and the writing are first-rate.In fact, I enjoy this film much more than his later works such as MOTHER and THE MUSE. Modern Romance revolves around real issues in the dating world. Some of the local shooting sites are enjoyable to view (Idyllwild, Hollywood). A must for Albert Brooks fans or fans of romance gone bad. )-:"
2,JUST HOW MUCH DISFUNCTION ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH?,"I almost hate to swim against the tide of the glowing reports from other reviewers, but unless you are a big fan of the incredibly fatiguing, downward spiral of interminable Jewish angst and disfuntional relationships (ala Woody Allen), then don't waste your time with this movie. I would almost warn people that if they consider themselves normal and want to stay that way, to watch this movie is a direct threat to their continued mental health. Finally, for those hormone-rich males who are hoping that the ""R"" rating means they will get some rare looks at Ms Harrold's naked form, forget it; there is one VERY brief long shot and that's it. The ""R"" must have come from the occasional filthy language."
4,Good stuff,"Well, obviously mike smith knows jack about good music. he's just as stupid as every other linkin park hater out there. face it dude, there is nothing you say that is even remotely intelligent so I suggest you grow up a little. I can see how people would compare Dry Cell to Linkin Park, the vocalist of Dry Cell sounds A LOT like Chester Bennington from Linkin Park. But that's not a bad comparison overall, as Linkin Park is a great band, and yes, so is Dry Cell. Unfortunately, Linkin Park goes a bit on the cliche side sometimes, and Dry Cell follows suit. But for the most part Dry Cell hold their own in the music business and is definitely a band worth checking out."
5,They still haven't released it why?,"There are few bands out there that can take Linkin Park's sound and improve on it. Dry Cell is one of the few that has been able to accomplish this feat with amzing success. I was lucky enough to have a friend who had ""Disconnected"" because it hasn't been released yet. Before I acquired this CD from him, I had only heard ""Body Crumbles"" off of Madden Football 2003, and it was the best song on the game's soundtrack. From ""Disconnected"" (the heaviest song on the CD) to ""Under the Sun"" (the smoothest song on the CD) to the reprive of ""Last Time"" (the most melodic song on the CD) Dry Cell seems to hit everything perfectly. My only discrepency with it is their feeble attempt to try to imitate Linkin Park's rap-rock sound on the song ""Brave"" but besides that, the CD is excellent. Warner Brothers is really missing out on some big bucks by not releasing this, and they should do it ASAP."
5,Under Rated,"Dry Cell is an awsome band, and truely deserves more attention. They need to release their album though. Keep an eye on this band, it's a flood gate waiting to open."
3,"Good, but Murky","A fairly well done collection, holding a group of talented writers. The over-all concept is an interesting one, but, alas, the execution falls a little short. For every good story here there is an average one. Still, a number of them are finely crafted. Jason Brannon and Christopher Fulbright enter excellent tales. Megan Powell, Walt Hicks, And Steve Shrewsbury do a good job, too. The production of the product is very good, though."
2,Water Logged,"Production values in p.o.d.'s usually are bad, but this collection from double dragon is put together well.Nevertheless, good production does not a good anthology make.For the most part, the stories are predictable and made me lose interest quick.While a couple of stories read well, several were not in the sphere of professionalism. The concept was fine: The selected stories could have been better. Were they memorable? The one with pirates and voodoo was good, and the story about the English channel read different and catty, but seemed not to belong here."
3,"Good concept, good results","A good collection of short stories. I never really heard of any of these people, but purchased this book on recommendation. The stories are good for the most part, but nothing to get excited about. I really enjoyed a couple stories more than others, but, suffice it to say, these two winners were worth wallowing in the average ones."
4,Very Nice Set!,"The only reason I didnt give this set another star is because I havent actually tried them yet but they are fantastic looking, seem very durable and well worth the $26.99 I paid for them. You can tell just by looking at them that they are well worth this price and MORE! I bought these for myself as an early Christmas gift and am really looking forward to trying these out!"
4,Nice Bakeware Set,"I snapped up this set when it got marked down under $30 mainly because I needed ramekins and some casserole dishes with lids. I haven't actually cooked/baked in them yet but they look great and I'm looking forward to trying them out. The only thing that perplexed me was when the box arrived, it said on the side: ship to QVC - Germany, which I thought was kind of odd. Inside...I located instructions but unfortunately...they were in german and since I only had 1/4 semester of the german language in junior high school...I have no idea what the instructions say to do. But I can live with that feeling I got an awesome deal on a nice looking set."
5,It's in the Bag,What more is there to say? The National Pastime has never been more accessible. It's about time someone thought of this.
3,Not quite what I expected,The field in a bag set has everything I would want in it. I just wish the bases and mound were a little closer to full-size.
3,You Get What You Pay For,"The base bags rip easily and stakes are flimsy. Also, the mallet seems held together with elmer's glue. However, on the whole, it seems a fair product for the price, which is pretty cheap."
