3,Sounds the same as first album,"I like Rise Against but this album sounds almost identical to their first album. Rise Against has to find something new, like a new rhythm or style/ beat because most of the songs sounded the same to me. I did like tracks 5, 7, 8 and 12 because they had a different rhythm and beat. C'mon guys, put something new out there!!"
5,Amazing!,"This album should have been the one to make Rise Against as famous as they are today. Although Siren Song... is better they should have made it huge with this release. This album has all the same characteristics that made Siren Song so amazing which are a full album of hard rocking punk songs that make you amped and scream along with no need at all to hit next. This album provides 13 blistering hardcore punk songs that include their first ""single"" Like the Angel as well as other favorites of mine: Blood- Red White & Blue, Dead Ringer, Halfway There, Heaven Knows and my favorite Black Masks & Gasoline. If you dont already have this and you like Siren Song then this may be the best album you can possibly buy right now. It blows the Unraveling away and is still one of my favorite cds."
5,Amazing...,"I found out about Rise Against from a friend and picked up ""The Siren Sound Of The Counter Culture"" (which, by the way is also an amazing record). So I was in a record store and i saw the album ""Revolutions Per Minute"" and bought it. After the first song, I knew that the record would be nothing short of brilliant. The lyrics are deep, poetic, and beautiful. Tim's vocals are so unique in that they are rough around the edges, but still so melodic and emotional that you can tell that he feels what he writes. As I am a guitarist and a drummer I look up to the guitarist and drummer of this band. The music is so catchy and there is actually talent involved. So to sum it all up, go get this album!! You won't regret it."
5,"Vital, urgent hardcore punk","When it comes to punk, I tend to lean more towards the emotionally driven stuff (thursday, acceptance) and the more pop-driven stuff (fall out boy, academy is..). I H8 green day, by the way. Anyway, I was drawn to rise against through the single ""like the angel"", and according to my counter, this record has had 60plus plays on my media library. Their music actually means something, unlike simple plan and the like, and their lead singer has a wonderful voice, both in screaming and singing mode (on a side note, he looks oddly similar to chad krouger). If you're not sure about this record, listen to some samples and make up your mind. Catchy, agressive and emotional; all the best elements of rock rolled into one supergroup! Also get ""siren song of counter culture"" if you get the chance"
5,Like the angel who brought us punk rock.,"WOW, Rise against is the definition of punk rock, these guys deserve more respect than they get. No matter what anybody tells you, these guys DO NOT SUCK, they rock. I first hard these guys while playing Tony Hawks underground and i heard their song Like the Angel, which was, and still is my 16th all time favorite song. Rise against blends two types of punk together perfectly, the ""in your face"" punk from Sum 41 and the ""sorry for all that"" punk from Silverstein. Tim is a big time vocalist and hopefully will continue Rise Against's greatness."
2,an utter disappointment and a failure to all but the most diehard of fans,"i expected much more from this dvd. but i guess i should have seen this coming, because most metal concerts are quite simple in nature. there's no improvisation--nothing unexpected and exciting. i was looking forward to a good behind the scenes documentary at the least, but i had to watch a fairly wooden host destroy it. i wonder who hired him. i give this poor excuse of a dvd two stars instead of one only because of my respect for the band."
4,pretty good,"in flames is the best band in the world, and i own every cd ever made by the band. i got this the day it came and out, and was thrilled. thats why i was so shocked to see the bad reviews here on amazon.so yeah, the sticky fingers show is sort of boring (they still sound awsome, of course) but the hammersmith and soundtrack shows are absolutly incredible. i live in alaska, and sadly have never got to see IF play. however the big shows make me feel like i am at one. the sound and camera angles are incredible, and the band has great stage presence. only for the weak live is one of the most incredible things i have ever seen on a dvd.the second cd is quite boring, except some of the music videos are pretty cool.the big shows completely make up for this, especcially with the cheap price. you will find yourself watching it over and over again."
5,Top Shelf,"In flames is so good. I enjoyed every aspect of this DVD. The interviews are great, the Hammersmith show is out of this world, sticky fingers is great as well. This band plays like a machine live. The guy that gave a bad review for expecting the unexpected odviously is not a musician. These are true pro's and they play like it. I dare you try to improve with such fine tuned music. These guys have honed there craft into something perfect and I could not imagine them ever really wanting to change that. Why would someone change what is already perfect. Every thing in this DVD is great. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!! Swedish metal is the best and In flames are the front runners in the game. Soilwork needs to put out a DVD as well, they are my favorite band of all time......."
5,kicks ass,"i dont know what the two first guys are bitchin about...the dvd is supposed to be in flames playing live shows...and thats what they did...who cares if the sticky fingers set was small, they sounded awesome, infact i thought it sounded way better than the hammersmith show. i loved this dvd...very good choice"
1,Be careful/NOT up to her usual!,"My alltime favorite author, but apparently was under a deadline to produce another book, or someone else wrote it? Poorly written, derivative, embarrassed for her. BUT do read her other books - Vida, He She & It, Woman on the Edge of Time, etc - excellent well-written, character development, etc. - don't waste time on Third Child."
2,Nearly a Complete Waste of Time,"I haven't had the chance to read anything else by Marge Piercy and after reading The Third Child I don't think I will. It's good that I picked it up at a thrift store and only paid $1 for it. I spent the entire time reading this book waiting for something interesting to happen. I made it to the last page without having done so. The plot goes nowhere and the characters are empty and sometimes annoying. I won't spoil the book for those truly interested but the ending made me so angry that I actually threw the book. I could sit for an hour explaining all the reasons this book is awful but I am going to go start a good book, White Oleander by Janet Finch. You have been warned."
1,Closing the cover at page 66,"I normally enjoy Marge Piercy's work, but this novel, unlike many of her previous stories, smacks of being pushed onto paper to fulfill a contract. The introductory narrative seemed stilted to me, but I ploughed on, hoping that Ms. Piercy's writing skill would shine forth as usual and I would be in for a pleasant read. Not so. The storyline threads are trite, the characters less than real, the dialog amateurish and unappealing. The Freshman English student Melissa, with all her faults, could have done better than Ms. Piercy has on this story. Saying anything more about this novel would be wasting my time - no need to be more specific. At page 66, I closed the cover, put on my shoes, and headed out to return The Third Child to the local library. As another reviewer has suggested, I will try ""The Namesake."""
2,Amateurish dialogue,"As a Piercy fan, I expected more. The plot was well executed, but the dialogue was ridiculous. Many times I just had to laugh at the stilted words spoken by these characters. What happened to Piercy? Was she rushed to get this book on the market? I did finally finish it, but I still can't believe Marge Piecy wrote something so amateurish."
2,Not what it says it is,"I bought this specifically because the description said that it was a black fridge. Turns out, it's white. And pretty small I might add. If you want to keep a can of soda and a sandwhich in there then it's probably OK for you, but anything more and I imagine it would all just fall out whenever you open the door."
5,blues on fire,"gary moore is one of my favs and this effort only betters my opinion. high energy and blazing solos. i love his rendition of stormy monday featured on this disk. this is one of those cd's you can play all the way through and not feel like you are getting any ""filler"" songs. a must own cd- for blues fans and rock and roll fans alike"
5,Moore is back !!!,"Moore is back,with another great blues album. If there is a chance you did like his previous bluesefforts you will like this one.The whole album is strong, but there are two very good sond worth the price alone: The Prophet,and Drowning in Tears. Very good Gary5 star effort"
4,king of modern blues!,"people ragged on ""different beat"" but I thought it was great. So gary's back to the blues. he won't let you down on this one, as always his leads will sting & bite ya! his killer groove on the blues is all over this disc, it's like the late 80's early 90's when gary started putting this stuff out. he's so underrated, one of the best guitarist out there, besides jeff beck. you won't be let down with this disc, gary has got a way with the blues. pick it up!"
5,THE MAN'S BACK,"YES, AFTER YEARS OF EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT STYLES, GARY HAS RETURNED TO THE THING HE DOES BEST! THIS ALBUM WOULD BE ADORED BY ANY GUITAR FANATIC OR BLUES LOVERS IN GENERAL. BUY THIS ALBUM. IT'S THE BEST SO FAR AND IS INCREDIBLE IN EVERY WAY. IT HAS A COMBINATION OF SLOW INSTRUMENTALS AND POWERFUL SONGS LIKE 'STORMY MONDAY'.IT'S JUST A SHAME NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF THE BEST GUITARIST IN THE UNIVERSE.GARY MOORE RULES..."
3,Only 50% Blues,"Gary Moore can definitely play the Blues and he can also write a great Blues song,but most of his original tunes on this CD I would really not consider in the Blues tradition.The cover tunes are all excellent and 1 or 2 of his originals.But,I'm not saying this is a bad CD.Gary Moore is an excellent Guitarist,but I don't consider him a real Bluesman.On this CD,I hear 50% Blues and 50% Rock."
3,Stale,"I remember in an interview Gary said he gave up playing metal after releasing After the War as the material was becoming stale. Writing and playing the same thing was becoming boring. Sadly, I see the same thing happening here. It seems that his last couple of records, post Blues for Greeney, are sufferring the same fate. I've found that I can't get beyond 3 or 4 songs before I'm ready to listen to something else. I love Gary's playing and it pains me to say so. Thankfully, I can always fall back on After Hours or Corridors of Power."
1,visually unclear/bad copy,"I have purchased several books in the past from Amazon.com, but to date this is the first book that I have ordered that I have been severly disappointed with. Although, Amazon is not the problem, it's with the publisher of this text. They have attempted to reproduce (or copy) materials relating to John Wilbur from his past journals, but in so doing, something went terribly wrong, and the entire book, from start to finish, is totally illegible. The only thing that IS legible is the title on the front cover of the book. I am really disappointed in the poor quality of print, by attempts on the part of the publisher....it does no one any good to review it, if they can't even read it.Bob ---- Lancaster, PA"
3,Beware of the pink!,"I bought these to go with a pink outfit-the style of the shoe was perfect. However, these shoes are not pink. They are a pinkish tan, more tan than pink, so buyer beware!"
3,Keeping it real?,Not a fan of the title. But it happens. Big fan of Leslie Esdaile. the book was okay. But it didn't hit the spot for me like her books normally do. This one left something to be desired. It started off good. but along the way it lost me with the main character's bs of explanations. The whole game of it kind of dropped for me. I think maybe because I'm not a fan of reality tv. So this book kind of reiterated that whole thing of why I don't like reality tv. And it wasn't very believable for me.I understand it's fiction. But this just didn't hit it for me.
2,Interesting info--but was this a first draft?,"This book is a good overview of Lugosi's career, but I have some doubts as to its accuracy because it was so poorly edited. It almost reads like a first draft.I mean, this thing, has extra commas, just dropped in, like pepper!Oftentimes names are spelled one way at the opening of a paragraph, and another way at the end. Sentences are repeated from page to page as though the author pasted but forgot to cut.At one point a paragraph even begins by announcing a ""Film review of Spooks Gone Wild:""This is then followed by four paragraphs about another film entirely, ""Black Dragons.""Did anybody read this thing a second time before going to press? So incredibly sloppy!How can I even believe the basic facts the author presents if he and his editor can't even get sixth grade composition down?"
3,"Bela, a review","A good book but I noticed some obvious mistakes from the ""get-go"" like in the opening statements when it was said that Lugos was formerly Romania but now Hungary but it is actually the opposite- formerly Hungary but now Romania! Also, there was much repetition in the quotes in the book. Other than that it was actually one of the better books on Bela that I have read. I am Canadian but speak Hungarian and love Bela so I am always looking for a good biography of his!"
5,TRULY FANTASTIC,"This book made an instant fan of Bela Lugosi,from it i learned that he did more films than just 'Dracula'but he did lots of other things too.the book made hunt out more of Bela's iilms and i'm sure i drove my wife mad getng them,but i enjoyed every singe one of them,all thanks to this book.my favouites are ""Scared To Death' and""Invisible Ghost"".i would tell all new ela fans to hunt out this book as so much i crammed to it on just a small page count.Larry Edwards did a great job for the master of terror.i love this book."
5,The Best Biffy Album Thus Far,"Little is known about Biffy Clyro here in the States so I was very surprised by this band when I happened to come across them randomly on Myspace. Wow, this band is great. I purchased all their albums shortly thereafter and I like this one the most. This album is a little more prog-rock and ""mature"" sounding than Blackened Sky and every song on it is quality. I wouldn't call Biffy Clyro a prog band, but there are definitely some prog elements to some of their songs. If you enjoy great straight forward alt-rock with elements of punk, prog, and metal, pick up this album."
5,Staggeringly funny,"The idea is preposterous: two non-alpinists, one working in fashion design, the other a diplomat, decide to scale some of the hardest peaks in the world, in one of the nastiest, most remote corners of the globe. The resulting book is hysterical. It's been a couple of years since I last read it, yet I'm giggling again as I recall some specific passages. Fun, fast read."
4,Not much has changed in 50 years,"A thoroughly enjoyable book from a Brit who always had room for adventure. (Read ""The Last Grain Race"" for Newby's adventures as a teen sailing a traditional working sailing ship around the world.)Most interesting to me was seeing how little has changed in the subsequent 50 years. Afghanistan remains today just as tribal, just as inaccessible, just as rugged, and just as fascinating."
4,A Great Yarn,"A ""short walk"" is at once accurate and understated. Accurate because the walk is short, less than a month. Understated because its walkers confront extreme challenges and setbacks at every turn, ranging from hostile citizens and difficult weather to physical maladies that would drive the less intrepid of us to the nearest hospital."
4,Walking Back Again,I first read this book as a teenager and it turned me into a life-long Eric Newby fan. It was probably the first travel book I read. It can be dangerous to go back and re-read really old favorites (as I recently discovered in trying to re-read Hemingway) but this one didn't disappoint the 2nd time around. I love his dry English humor and the way he is so typical of the 'mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the mid-day sun'. I'd definitely recommend this.
2,Not so amusing...,"Eric Newby describes his travels in vintage English style. There is some dry humor in the book, and there are good descriptions of the places he traveled through and the people that he met. However, the journey seems to have caused him considerable discomfort, which is described in detail. His description of the Afghan countryside does not, for the most part, make it sound like an appealing place. He also, generally, draws very unflattering portraits of the local populace. The almost constant negativity, which too often did not reach the level of dry humor, made for a less than agreeable read. Endurance by Alfred Lansing, which describes the adversities faced by another group of English adventurers, is a much more entertaining book."
2,Not a good travel book,This book was really hard to keep my attention. I did not find it exciting at all and did not get emotionally attached. I must admit that I did not read the whole book because I tried several times and never got into it. I bought it because Lonely Planet had branded it and I love all of their travel books. This is not in the same vain or writing style as a LP book.
1,World Class Fraud,"Amway, the company Rich DeVos co-founded with Jay VanAndel, has been selling phony business opportunities to millions for fifty years. The scale of the cumulative fraud dwarfs the crimes of Bernie Madoff. The DeVos's have skillfully reinvested some of this ill-gotten fortune in PR and self promotion, this book being one example. ""Succeeding with Integrity in Business and Life"" has to be one of the most ironic tag lines to grace the cover of any book.After reading this book, I would suggest ""Merchants of Deception"", available free online."
4,"Good Book, but simply republished under new name","This book is the SAME as ""The Pleasures of Staying in Touch"" also, by the same author. Thinking it was a different book with perhaps new information, I bought it only to see that it is identical to the other book published under a different title.I'm happy with the book, but not happy about essentially buying a duplicate book at extra expense!"
3,Not worth registering for - one star only,"I had thought I was getting a six-pack of the onesies packed with the washcloths, but they come in two 3-packs of bodysuits and the washcloths are separate. I would have rather had them sell the onesies in the three packs for a lesser price, and skip the washcloths. Everything is a nice quality, particularly the washcloths, but it was an expensive item and I wouldn't have bought it myself. Also, they are very hard to get on and off a newborn."
4,Dark,"Dean Bowman's vocal delivery (unfortunately only one one track) atop Peder's dark production comes across as a fictitious marriage between Tom Waits and the Cinematic Orch (only more sombre) for today's beat generation. That said, the sound is much more than that referenced before. Lush cellos, haunting themes and a definite David Lynch/ian soundscpaes make this album a great soundtrack to an unreleased noir. However, unlike the Cinematic Orch. there is not much a live interplay amongst the ""players""."
4,"Nice Riffs, Melodies, and Beat","I saw this band when they opened for Spoon at Trees in Dallas earlier this year. The good thing about Trees is that it's tiny, and you're way up close to the stage even if you're standing as far back as you can. The point is that you simply find yourself *listening* more closely, so let me assure you, I listened to TNHistory. :) Julian Tepper, the bassist, and the drummer (forget his name) jokingly urged my friend and I to buy their ep, but we were going to buy it anyway after hearing them play. They have VERY nicely put together songs, great melodies, too, and they're real 'foot tappers.' There's nothing overly complicated or pretentious about their music--Just enjoyable stuff, rather above the level of 'garage rock,' but you still can't call it 'simple.' It's too good to be 'simple.'"
2,Good Book - Bad Kindle Edition,"I do like these stories, but every Miss Read book seems filled with a terrible number of errors. Sentences like ""Wed, wed, you must ted me ad about it"", irritate me no end. Mr. Willet sometimes becomes Mr. Wider, oil lamps become od lamps, a meeting on the following Thursday is altered to Mowing Thursday. This is the worst book I have encountered so far. I am undecided about continuing to collect the series."
4,evelyn's books,The Miss Read books are unfailing to lift my spirits. I own several and have begun to find them in my public library. I recommend this book to anyone looking for light reading. Especially as a break from some of the heavy tomes out there now.
5,Amazing,"This cd is something I have been looking for, for a while. I have not heard this type of house since I lived in Chicago. It totally brought my memories back, and I have been listening to the cd almost everyday now."
4,"Compelling, Exciting, Interesting, Lacking","I think the title of this review sums my opinion of this book rather well. The book is thoroughly engrossing- except for some overly intimate scenes between two lovers- and more full of detail about a lesser known area of World War II than any other book out there- any. Although this book is not comparable to Year of the Dragon, and amazing book he published in 1981 (the movie wasn't so amazing, however) it was his first foray into the Holocaust. Although this book provides much excitement, it lacks what is most important in any War novel... pace. Although I enjoyed reading it for its incredible accuracy, I was unhappy with the pace at which this story moved. The middle of the book went to slowly, the ending too the endiong too quickly. ALl in all, however, a good read."
3,A Story Of Those-Behind-The-Lines In France WW2.,"A fascinating story of people trapped in Nazi occupied France in World War II. The author knows his subject, the terrain, the characters, and all the small details of the time and the situations described. The sole defect of this book is that the author tells his tale so straight and somehow at-a-distance that the author does not seem to care who wins or loses and thus, neither does the reader. The author also does unnecessay embellishment; for instance we read pages of background on a priest - a minor character who appears briefly - for no apparent reason. Robert Daley is a craftsman who does a good job of writing - but he neither varnishes nor polishes his work. Good while you read it, but soon forgotten when you put it down."
3,Not up to Daley's Usual Standard,"Generally, this new novel from veteran author Robert Daley is absorbing and includes several richly drawn characters. However, the love story is fairly trivial and the ending lacks tension.Daley was a foreign correspondent in Paris for several years, is married to a French woman, and in several of his previous works has brought France and its culture to life, as very few American novelists can.In this new book, I didn't feel that Daley dug into French culture as well as he has done in his earlier books, particularly the long-out-of-print ""Strong Wine Red As Blood"".Daley is not an elegant writer, but he is an expert storyteller, albeit one who occasionally descends to the level of pulp fiction. His work deserves to be more widely read, and hopefully the kind of story he tells here will find a wider audience than his police stories."
5,Great Bourbon Sippin' Music,"This is a marvelous compilation of authentic, front-porch Americana. I live in North Carolina and hear my share of Bluegrass. If you're a fan of groups such as the Red Clay Ramblers, as I am, this will show you what their predecessors sounded like. True roots music. The recording is great, as well. Nary a hiss or pop, which is quite remarkable for recordings of this era. The engineers obviously embarked on a labor of love. Kudos to Sony for this collection."
1,Horrid Product. A danger to your possesions. Beware of binder pages,"I would give this negative stars if possible. Any Case Logic products with this type of sleeve design (that hold 4 disc per side of page) will inevitably damage the outer area of your disc. This is due to the fact that the design allows for a small amount of your discs on the inside of the page to overhang the ""protective"", ""covered"" area. Sure there is some form of fiber padding underneith, but all it manages do to is scuff the outer rim of the disc! Eventually you find that there is a long line of vertical scuff/scrathes along the outer area. Thanks Case Logic for ruining my personal property. What's the one thing you'd buy a product like this for? To safely store your media, I'd wager. What's the primary thing it flat out fails to do? Guess...."
2,Lost in the Stone Age,"Back to the Stone Age follows the adventures of Lieutenant von Horst of the airship O-220 inPellucidar as he attempts to find his fellow crew members after being separated from them duringa titanic herbivore stampede caused by hundreds of saber-toothed tigers conducting a massslaughter. Getting lost in Pellucidar, Edgar Rice Burroughs' world within our world, is rather easy todo since it is virtually impossible to get one' bearings there. The Sun remains fixed in the centerof the sky and the horizon curves upward so even the tallest peaks tend to merge into thebackground. This sort of enviorment tends to lead to much aimless wandering about, interrupted frequentlyby the most unlikely of coincidences as characters separate and meet again a timely manner. Thisprecludes a coherent plot structure, but Von Horst does have some interesting adventures."
2,A Major Let Down,I was excited when I heard of the latest release on Quantam Leap Mirror's Edge and promptly ordered it As stated by several other readers this book lacks the excitment of many of the other books in the series and was very confusing in places. Half the time I had to go back just to clarify what the writer was trying to say. The dropping of many major characters who featured predominatly in the earlier books also was very disapointing The foul Language also did not enamore me towards the book ether. I was most disapointed in this book and Hopefully someone will take up the stories published on the QL website and print them Without giving away the ending it was in complete competition with the 2nd last episode of the TV series
1,Terrible disservice to the series,"It's as if the publishers want to end the demand for QL novels by leaving such a bad taste in our mouths that we just don't have the heart for more. Sam is out of character--not just foul mouthed, but a selfish, thoughtless, unpleasant man.Lots of threads are introduced that are left hanging--indeed, the whole story line is left hanging. If you remember Twin Peaks--this is a ""red curtain ending.""This is billed as the last novel in the series. If they can't do better than this, it should be! This thing in a betrayal of the fans. Switch to fanzines--at least the writers love their chosen characters. This writer really doesn't like any of these people. A tragic disappointment."
3,Disappointing ending,"I overall was intrigued by the book. It wasn't as bad as alot of people say, yet it wasn't as good as the better books in the series were. I didn't like this new David guy, I really think we would've been better served in this ""Final"" book by having that character be Sammy Jo. The whole Ziggy crashing and interfacing with the other computers was stupid. I really wish they had've explored the whole idea Sam brought up about Lothos. Ended to rapidly and confusingly."
3,A response,"An author's comment about ""Mirror's Edge""... the book doesn't tie up loose ends and bring Sam home because the publisher and Universal wouldn't allow it. It's been one of their ironclad rules from the get-go: Sam doesn't get to come home. Sorry, to those of you who are disappointed by that. (My giving myself 3 stars is only because the software won't allow me to avoid rating my own work.)"
3,"Good story, but-","I would have given this book 4 or 5 stars, but the ending brought it down. I don't want to say too much. The story was good, there are areas of confusion, but one of the better Leap novels. My favorite is Song and Dance. I hate to see the series end, but I guess too many people have lost interest in Quantum Leap."
3,Should Have Been A Sequel,"The story was extremely promising. However, the ending left a LOT to be desired. If the author made this book the sequel to ""Mirror's Image"" instead of a prequel, it would have given her more room to give the story a proper ending.Also, Al's characterization was way too crass. In the TV series, his humor was only tongue-in-cheek. In this book he comes off as a dirtball, not a decorated admiral."
5,"Oh, Boy","Wow. This book is amazing. I don't know about you, but I usually get right into a book, and this one was no exception. I have been a Quantum Leap fan since I was 11, and I'm 22 now. For 11 years this series has drawn me in, and the books only make it better. This one in paticular brings you deep into the mind of Sam Beckett, and the struggle he has had to endure for the last 5 years. I won't give away the story, but this book will teach you more about Sam, Al, Donna, and even Ziggy than you ever thought you knew!!"
3,Not as sturdy as I expected,"Looks like another shelf that I purchased, but not nearly as sturdy. The shelf doesn't seem to be that strong and it would not shock me if the shelf was severely bent in a couple months. I'm going to keep it anyway. It was cheap (both in construction and cost)."
2,good for storing feather pillows,"this ""stackable"" shelving is overall rather disappointing. it is constructed of very thin gauge wire, and surprisingly is very light weight shelving. do not expect to store any objects weighing substantially more than pillows or comforters. while this is advertised as suitable for ""garage"" storage, there is little - if anything - in my garages that could be stored on these units. compared to prior, similar wire shelving, these are dramatically light weight and unsuitable for general storage."
2,Super flimsy,"I bought this shelf as a cheap shelf to use in my linen closet to hold up laundry items. The way you hold up the shelf is with two shell like things that you snap together at the right height. As you might guess getting the right height on all four is hard. If the shelf is slightly off balance it collapses.....I guess you could use it if you were precise about the height and were only storing light things but I am currently looking for a replacement. This shelf fell apart repeatedly with all my laundry items on it. I really like Seville Classics Resin-Wood Composite Utility Shoe Rack instead.I used it as a replacement for this Whitmor shelf and only used the top shelf. It is super sturdy, a bit higher than I would like and higher than the Seville but at least things won't fall down and spill everywhere."
4,nice product--recommend,"it is a good product, i put it in the kitchen, and it can holds 3 big pots very nicely."
5,Super shelf,"This shelf was so great and super easy to put together. I bought one, and I was so satisfied that I ordered another one to stack on top of the other. I especially liked how the shelves could be put together with special screws that add extra support and stability. It was also nice that I could do everything from assembling each unit, and stacking them together without needing a single tool. The parts were also packaged in a way that kept it from damage, but not so much that it was a struggle to get all the parts out, just needed a pair of scissors. The shelves now give me a great place for books and sturdy enough to hold my books (these are college textbooks - not light or little by any means) and my tv."
3,Flimsy,"It will do the job for right now but it is not as strong as other wire shelving that I have purchased. I can bend the wire with my fingers easily, the legs wobble, and there is no way that I would put anything heavy on it. I am using it to allow a cabinet with no shelves to be more functional and so far, so good."
3,Speed sensors don't work with it!,"I have a 2006 BMW 330i E90. I verified that the part fits my car. Upon installation, it fits physically quite alright, but the speed sensors stopped working. Everything tied to the speed sensors like the traction control, ABS, tire pressure monitor all stopped working. The bearings had to be pulled again and the MAGNETIC ring from the old bearings put on them before everything went back to normal. This of course cost a lot more at the garage and ideally, when a bearing is pulled it should not be used again. If you buy this bearing, you'll experience the same thing unless it is for the models that do not use a magnetic pickup speed sensor."
5,New happy times are here,Now I can enjoy this show with my own children. I used to watch it with my brothers and sisters. A good show to watch. The service was and the DVD's were in great shape.
5,Excellent,I recieved this with 4 days. It came in very nicely packed and I am enjoying it very much. I recommend this to anyone who likes wildlife.
4,Condition was not as described...,"I am not typically critical, but I purchased this expensive DVD set in NEW condition as a gift for someone else. I recieved the order quickly, but the DVD's package was torn and absolutely not in ""like new"" condition. I was a little dissappointed because I paid a lot of money for something that appeared used/damaged. The DVD's worked fine, but the appearance was most ertainly not NEW."
2,Don't Assume,"I purchased the complete set. All 12 seasons. I watched Marty years ago and the picture quality was superb for the times ...that said I assumed way too much. I have a 32 inch Sony LCD flat screen with HD. The picture quality is NOT what I was expecting as the picture ratio for HD flat screens is totally different.This is NOT HD digital quality!!! So my rating is on the picture quality. One other item is that Marty does go on and on about evolution. I personally am not big on the whole evolution thing...species can and do evolve and adapt to their environment but I don't buy into animals completely changing... you are not convincing me that a manatee is a close cousin of the Elephant. One more item if you buy these, you get what you pay for. $39.00 is not bad for the 12 seasons but be real careful removing them from the containers! I cracked my first season DVD and I was trying to be careful in removing it. They are really tight. So glad I did not pay over $45 for this series."
3,"Discs Fine, Case Not.","The only complaint I have about this set of DVDs was the case for them. All of the little nubbins that hold the discs in place broke off during the shipment or within days of receiving it. Since it was a gift, that kind of sucked. I'm planning on following up with the people who sent it and asking for a replacement if possible."
1,Excellent family entertainment!,"The video series offers many 30-minute episodes about different animals species. It is visually stimulating and educational. A perfect night of viewing for families, even those with small children."
2,"Incomplete, Inaccurate information","This book leaves out details for a lot of simple maintenance. For example, there is no section to cover the parts need to disassembled to change out spark plugs on V6 model. Torque listed is different (way higher 19ft.lbs VS 14 for spark plugs) from one specified in factory repair manual. Don't rely on this book for your car, you may damage your car's parts. $23 is a waste."
5,great Manual for repair,This is the best Manual for repairs that I have found. The pictures help and there is a few pages in the front to help you troubleshoot any problems. Very well written and easy to understand.
3,Haynes repair manual for Toyota Camry 2002-2006,"I like the Haynes manuals. Amazon had a good price and I didn't need to drive to town for the book. This style of manual is helpful in determining, if you want to try the repair yourself or take it to a shop. This is not a full blown service manual. I use the manual for torque specification and insight and advice for working on the vehicle."
4,u-boat,"This album is interesting. I was in the market for a Bowie album when I saw this one behind. The album is not half bad but if you are a David Bowie fan don't expect to hear anything about him on this album. Its a good classic rock album if you view it as that. Very produced, crisp drumming, strong vocals, decent song writing. Nothing too original but entertaining when given a chance. ""Slow Down"" is an excellent song but the rest of the album falls short. ""Ooh la la"" is a good romp."
4,"*FYI:figures are miniatures,not full-size original figure replicas","I was at a big box store and saw these season 7 ""slices"", I remembered seeing them on Amazon first and thinking ""oh cool,they come with an OG-style toy too!""--NOT exactly. I looked at the packaging and saw this micro-figure that has the weapons permanently attatched to it's hands. Sooo...I give these season 7s 4/5 stars because although the included figures are kinda lame, at least more seasons of old TMNT are still being released."
1,Horrible service,I bought three videos that were suppose to be brand new just like the picture showed with a toy. And all three were missing the toy when they should've had it. Then when I wrote inetvideo they just said that their version is different when its not they just took the DVDs out and sent them incomplete
3,no toy,just got this in the mail today and am disappointed that i didnt get the little turtle with it just the dvd. feel kinda riped off
5,tmnt are back,"hello dudes,this season 7 it very very beatifull,first for returns of casey jones,two ,because are more extra and the enemy and friends of tmnt are too big!!great amazon ^^"
3,The Good With the Bad,I'm a huge turtles fan. I've been following them my entire lifer basically. To see these old toons on DVD is great. The show is corny and most of the episodes are pretty bad but it holds true nostalgic value for me. As much as I like these Lions Gate releases I can't help but feel like I'm getting screwed when I pay 10 dollars for a DVD with only 6 episodes on it. The documentary on the disk is pretty badly put together so the special features aren't worthwhile either.On top of it all these are some of the worst episodes of the entire series. I can't even sit through them. I recommend this to any die hard fan but anyone looking to remember turtles as something great I'd avoid this disk at all costs.
3,Sequel to Slaughter tells good story.,"This sequel to Slaughter is a good story, but it wraps up too many loose ends too quickly. There is good action, but it happens too fast and is too predictable. It is very well written, like all of Kelton's novels, and is an accurate description of the climate and environment of South-Central and West Texas. It is also an accurate description of the hard work needed to survive on the high plains and panhandle of Texas and in the post-Civil War South. Poor plot but good description of Texas at that time an the environment of West Texas."
5,good read,"I found myself drawn into this story, as so often Kelton does to his readers. I enjoyed it and found it difficult to put down"
5,Samantha Stevens (Bewitched) couldnt have done it any better,"It was a thoroughly enjoyable read. The characters, as with all of Ms. Fletchers people,were fleshed out and believable. The humor made me smile and laugh out loud, no matter where i was at the time. The author adds little touches that tells us who the characters are, the toe ring for an example and we gladly suspend our beliefs to encompass the magic of our heroine and her family. I found it funny, romantic, touching and informative. Here's hoping she has sequels so we can follow the family thru their past history on up thru today. Kudos to an author who can give us such interesting plot lines and rich characters. Thank you ms. fletcher."
5,A magical journey into the heart,"Donna Fletcher does it again! Another book that goes straight to the heart of what makes romance novels worth reading. Entertaining, interesting and difficult to put down, Wedding Spell is a unique story with fairies, witches and enough love to make it a must read."
2,"A charming premise, but flawed execution","This book began with a charming set-up and attractive characters, but there was nothing keeping the hero and heroine apart during the second half of the book but the hero's pig-headedness. I don't know about you, but I don't find that appealing. Other than the heroine's need for the hero to commit himself to her willingly and completely, and the hero's unwillingness to believe in her being a witch, there is no plot. The writing itself has a hasty feel, as though the author knocked it out in a weekend and never polished it. There are also misused words and phrases that aren't quite worded correctly, which is not what I've come to expect from Berkley. I was very disappointed."
2,not what i expected,"I thought that this book was quite boring in the beginning. What led me to read on, I dont know because I really wasn't that interesting. I found myself skipping several pages at a time to try to find a part that was even remotely interesting. Only towards the end did it get interesting and even then it was not that good. The climax of the story was fast and over with quickly. I felt as though the book itself were stretched out longer than it should've been, therefore making it boring with it's usless comments. The chracters were not really in dept and the story line is too slow. Sebastion seems like a good inteeligent man, but it seems to me that it would be highly unlikely that he would fall in love with a women just after some dreams he was having about her. Over all I did not really like this bopok and for those of you who are interested I recomend that you find another book to fill your time."
2,This series was average,Normally I enjoy reading Donna Fletcher's stories but I thought this series was average and I struggled to stay interested to the end. The character's and their romances were a little unbelievable.
3,could have been better,"The bones of this story were good, but it just wasn't fleshed out right.The heroine's a 300-year-old witch who needs a mate to rejuvenate her powers. The hero's CEO of a security company, deeply grounded in logic and rationality.It could have been really good, and I wish I could put my finger on why it isn't. The characters didn't grab me; the conflicts just didn't seem to play out.It reminds me of Linda Howard's books, in the way I feel like I should love the stories, but I don't. Perhaps the problem's the same: the author's telling me what the characters are feeling rather than showing me."
2,Good setup with a poor follow through,"The heroine is a witch who has lived 300 years without love (or a lover for that matter) and is in danger of losing her powers. She must ""recharge"" by mating with a powerful lover. How's that for a hook? Frustratingly, though, that promising idea wasn't enough to make this book anything more than average. I soon lost all interest in the story because of the irritatingly flawless (and often too stupid to live) heroine and all of the other cardboard-like characters that filled the book. If I had to sum up this story in one word it would be ""emotionless"". I felt no connection to the characters. Despite a few charming moments the story was bogged down with a weak conflict that was not consistently developed. I don't recommend this one unless you _really_ have a thing for witches and relationships based solely on lust."
4,An amazing story about an amazing woman,"This book starts a little unevenly, but by the third chapter you can't put it down. Judy Justad is a woman who doesn't know the meaning of the words ""can't"" -- ""no"" -- or ""don't!"" The colorful -- and often tragic -- stories she relays about the women and children she met over a span of thirty years are alternately uplifting, heartbreaking and hopeful. What she has done to help the poor, abused, and those without a voice, is inspiring and amazing. I will highly recommend this book to others."
2,Artistically --- a wipe-out,"This 1963 outing by the Beach-Boy-in-waiting will be of interest only to pop historians and Beach Boy completists. While it does have a slight period charm and above-average production values for the time, the material is pedestrian teen exploitation. Makes Jan and Dean look like visionaries."
4,"I've been ""Caned""","""Product was as described and On Time. I am not a big fan of Foam handles however other than the old Hard Plastic the Foam is better. It will twist a bit and can be easily Chipped by medium sharp objects. I like my old one better but I can't find them anywhere. It has a curved handle but not all the way to 180 degrees."""
2,Cheap Chinese Quality,"Typical cheap quality Chinese made product. The center support had been welded incorrectly and the angle was not 90 degrees from the base. It was more like 70 degrees. Had to use shims when mounting the table to the center support to allow the table to sit flat. After using shims, the table serves it's purpose. Other than the incorrectly welded angle of the center support, it wasn't bad. Again, it's made in China, so you get what you pay for."
4,Great realese on c.d i need a 3pints,"I still have the original realese on earache records among them the Stupids,heresy,ripchord,unseenterror,napalm death this album is killer grind core the fathers of the grind scene Among early DISORDER,A must for new h.c grind core fans,remember this came out in 83 or 84?"
2,Meh.....,Mine did not come with the lanyard shown in the product pic. Burt's Bees is far better. Just go to CVS or Target and pick up a lip balm and save yourself the wait. It's nothing special.
4,Book worth the first chapter.,"I really am a fan of Mary Oliver and absolutely relate to the first chapter and love it. The rest of the prose, which is mostly about her ""nature"" walks was just ""ok"" for me."
2,First Show of the Tour,"This was the first show of the Spring 2002 tour, and the show is good, but mostly unremarkable. The 2nd set is solid, and a good selection of songs, but the band was pressed for time during this show, and anyone who knows String Cheese will tell you that they need time to ""expand"" and ""explore"". Instead, at this show you get good versions of everything, but nothing really stands out. The next two nights were *MUCH* better. Additionally, this is the only 2-disc show in the OTR series (to date). I'd recommend 4/27, 4/21, 4/13, 4/6, 4/5, 4/19 before I recommend this one. If you just HAVE to hear guest, Jack Black singing the Rush song ""Tom Sawyer"" for the encore, then this is the show for you. Otherwise, your money would be spent more wisely on the next two nights, or any of the other shows I listed above."
5,To bad this formula for writing history has not been applied worldwide.,"It's no wonder his work survives to this date... and for sure, beyond.I felt like I was there with the writer and walked his steps as he discovered Egypt and nearby lands."
4,Classic,This is a major source for much of what we know about the ancient world. It also contains lot of gossip anecdotes and odd stories.
3,NOT a German-made product,"I contacted Bosch in Salt Lake City after reading Amazon reviews that claimed the ""Bosch"" cookie paddles customers received were not genuine Bosch parts. I found out, to my dismay, that the reviewers were correct. The paddles are NOT genuine, German-made, Bosch. Unlike the whips, dough hooks, etc. that are manufactured in Germany, the cookie paddles are manufactured by another company and then DISTRIBUTED by Kitchen Resources. The paddles are made of plastic. While they do scrape the sides of the bowl nicely, they are not meant to survive hard butter or very heavy doughs. They should work fine for light to medium doughs, similar to the whips. I have broken whips before on hard butter, and apparently these paddles can't handle it either. According to the Bosch representative in Salt Lake City, the paddles have a five year warranty. Who honors that warranty, though--Kitchen Resources, the manufacturer, or Bosch?"
4,"Works great, but broke easily","These work better for cookie mixing then the wire wisks. We had these for about 6 months only used maybe 12 times and they broke. Hopefully this time they will last a bit longer. Aside from the longevity, they work fantastic."
2,teeth on paddles break,The teeth on these cookie paddles broke after less than 1 year of use. Not impressed with the quality of this product.
2,cookie paddles break,"I love my universal bosch mixer but was disappointed in the plastic paddles at the get go. I have only used them a handful of times since I purchased the mixer mainly for large batches of bread. While mixing up a large batch of cookie dough, my paddles broke as the butter was too cold. In retrospect, I should have waited on the butter or softened it in the microwave. Oh well, I didn't and three of the plastic pieces broke off in the dough and I had to choose to either throw out the batch or sift through the dough to locate the pieces so someone didn't get them in a cookie. What a mess! It would be much better if they were made from metal or ceramics as other mixture paddles. A design flaw in my opinion."
5,Shocked at the bad reviews!,I had my set of cookie paddles for over 5 years before I broke them by accidentally using them to mix bread dough. They work SO well for cookies--and our cookies taste GREAT! We get compliments on our cookies wherever we bring them. I'm back on this site to buy another set...
4,I love my Bosch! These cookie paddles are pretty good!!,"I just ordered my second pair of cookie paddles. Yes, my daughter broke my last years old pair, on hard butter that had been frozen but not completely thawed. Having said that, they work well for the purpose they were designed, and it doesn't make me uncomfortable that they wouldn't hold up under huge amounts of stress. I wouldn't use them for bread dough. I wouldn't have used them on partially frozen butter. These are a good product and I look forward to having a new pair so I can get on with making fabulous cakes and cookies using these paddles in the future. I love my Bosch!!"
4,Love making cookies,"I have had my bosch for awhile and was switching to a dough hook when I put in the flour for my cookies. These make it so you don't have to do that. The only thing I would say is be careful when putting them on the metal gear piece. I have already broke off several pieces of the plastic around the hole. I thought for the price they would be a little higher quality, I'm just hoping the pieces that are left will hang on!"
2,Broken teeth,"I have had my cookie paddles for over a year. They don't make the cookies taste any better.I do not use them frequently, but the inside teeth, on both paddles, that fasten them to the driver have broken. The manufacturer is sending me a new set.Be sure that you do not interchange the plastic driver for the whisks with the metal one when using the paddles.I am pleased with my mixer and the company, but I wouldn't buy the cookie paddles again; the bread hook makes fine cookies."
4,"KORN, NIRVANA, DEFTONES, RADIOHEAD","Stepa breaks away from our current state of nostalgia. They are musicians with a progressive sound. As mainstream rock music meshes into a similar sound (much like the evolution 80's rock), Stepa revolts. They continue a revolution started by break-through bands in the early 90's. Stepa's self titled debut can be looked at as a tribute to such greats as Korn, Nirvana, Deftones, and Radiohead. Over the past decade many of us listened, and a talented few were influenced to form bands themselves. New musicians to carry on an alternative philosophy. Stepa is made up of such musicians. I rate Stepa's debut at a four of five, but buyers beware! Stepa's sophmore album will excel. As the mainstream meshes, Stepa's significance to the survival rock music will become obvious."
3,Is this the new Limp Bizkit CD?,"I don't listen to the radio anymore --- I buy CD's based on recommendations that I read on Amazon.com. These guys were recommended by people who have listened to and bought bands like Chevelle and Breaking Benjamin -- both of which I like.Have now listened to the Stepa CD a couple of times. I think these guys are a bit derivative. These guys sound a lot like Limp Bizkit with a little Incubus thrown in. The lead singer does a lot of Fred Durst-type screaming. But the music is interesting --- cool guitar riffs and syncopated drums. But the screaming gets in the way a bit.Not as good as Breaking Benjamin or Mad At Gravity or Chevelle, but not as bad as a lot of the lame a** stuff on the radio today."
3,Roger & Me,"In this blistering, satirical documentary, ex-journalist Michael Moore gives a personal account of the tough times in his hometown of Flint, Mich., after the General Motors plant was closed in the mid-1980s. The film revolves around Moore's dogged attempts to gain an interview with Roger Smith, the elusive and well-insulated head of GM and the man responsible for massive layoffs that eliminated more than 30,000 jobs and left the town destitute."
3,Roger & Me,"As a high scholl student I found this movie very interesting, but yet it was very boring. I feel bad for the people that were laid off by the GM corparation, I don't believe that ws the right thing to do. Some of the people that worked for them, that was the only way that they supported thier families. GM should have had a plan for those people that would be without pay. Instead of just putting them out on the streets, and telling them that there are other jobs out there. The reason that I rated this movie as a 3 is because it was so boring they probably could have changed the context to make it alittle more interesting to the viewer."
4,funny but not balanced,"This very funny movie is also very unbalanced, not that it makes any attempt to be. Moore is good at showing a few of the kooks and local sights that capture the spirit of a rotting town, but when he starts trying to analyze why things went so sour, the film gets unfortunately naive. Don't expect a movie about corporate ruthlessness, because the ruthlessness is taken for granted. What remains is really just a well-made portrait of American small-towners at their most pitiable, which I must admit can be pretty funny."
1,One sided story,Michael Moore gives a very biased view of Roger Smith. This film illustrates the uneducated Michael Moore. Michael Moore fails to shed light on many of the economical problems facing GM and Flint.
4,"Michael Moore's first is still his best, despite the vulgarities","Leftist-Anti EstablishmentarianMichael Moore is mad as hell andhe's not taking it anymore as hissmalltown America, Flint, MI hasjust lost 30,000+ jobs as greedyG.Motors Exects move plant to Mexicoand put above mentioned thousandsout of work. Moore does a good jobof keeping the subject serious fora change. Other good Moore filmsincluded Fahrenheit 911 and TheBig One. Others he's done get toofar into his leftist politics whichI am (far-political-middle/Populist)am not into. Good job here, Michael!"
5,moore is an american hero,"This is a great movie made by a man who simply cares about his neighbors and fellow Americans. I recommend watching this movie to both liberals and conservatives. If you have a heart and a brain, you'll see that Moore's work is a brave attempt at helping this country.I will never understand those on the right who call Moore a socialist and an America hater. Calling Moore anti American is simply asinine. And I strongly suspect that at least 90% of those accusers have never even seen this movie. (if you have seen it, the only other excuse for thinking Moore is unAmerican is that you are pure evil and have a breathtakingly low IQ)If your on the fence about Moore or just curious... this is the movie to watch. It's Moore at his best."
4,The fall of Flint,"Documentary on the destruction of Flint, MI, with the closing of GM plants there and the laying off of 30,000 workers. Michael Moore is the filmmaker and Roger is Roger Smith, the head of GM at the time, whom he tries, without success, to interview on the tragedy at Flint. Irony is the best device to use in a documentary like this, and Moore loads the film with it: people being evicted while the rich are saying life is wonderful there, and the city investing millions of dollars in tourism but the tourists never come. The ultimate irony is found in the running interview Moore has with a GM p.r. man who argues for the good of the company - but at the end he's laid off, too. The movie goes on a bit too long and certain scenes seem to be there for effect only (for example, those with a woman who raises rabbits for food - we see her actually skinning one), but it's a good documentary nonetheless."
5,The ethos of Moore,"Moore consentrates so much on ethos (emotion) that is distracts veiwers from key issues of logic. He really places some seriouse allegations on Roger Smith, the CEO of the company, when some of these issues don't have any connection with the man. This movie is brilliantly edited and very entertaining. I suggest that we all watch it with an open mind so that we might not fall into blindly accepting someone esls' interpretation."
5,You'll never think the same about America or your Car again,"This is one of the most emotionally powerful documentaries on business I have ever seen. It's insanely dificult to create a movie that looks at both business and government the way this film does, but through an odd stroke of luck, Michael Moore pulls it off beautifully! The entire film is filled with the repricussions of an event which rocked the Automobile industry, and the entire town of Flint, Michigan. The logic makes you laugh, and the people make you cry. It's one of the best documentaries out there. Michael Moore did a fantastic job with this documentary, putting all the money he had in the world to make it. Watch it, and learn from it!"
5,Kick-ass (yo).,"If you want to know how Michael Moore got started, this is the film to see. A scathing, brutally funny assault on corporate culture in general and General Motors in particular (SEE ALSO: ""The Awful Truth"", ""TV Nation"" and ""Bowling for Columbine""). My rating: 10/10."
4,"Roger and Me. Or ""Me"" at least.","Roger and Me is the predecessor to Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11. The central theme of the movie is Moore's attempts to lure GM executive Roger Smith to Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan to observe the result of GM's various plant closings on the community.Moore's journey takes us into the lives of those in Flint as they are evicted from their homes, or find creative ways to supplement their income. It is through the window of these people that we see the destruction caused by the exodus of GM from the city. In other areas, however, Moore is his usual obnoxious self, placing himself in impossible situations, and subjecting his victims to scruntiny when his miracle connection fails to happen.Moore successfully brings the viewer into the plight of the Flint citizen, even though viewers may question the validity of his tactics in tracking down Roger Smith. If you're a fan of other Moore films, you will certainly enjoy this offering."
1,"Mean-spirited, egocentric - serves little purpose","This movie is more about making people look bad than it is about General Motors. The majority of the interviews are not humorous, make no real point, and have nothing to do with General Motors or Roger Smith. Moore spends more time with the rabbit lady and the eviction guy than he does with anyone else. And what purpose does showing a rabbit being killed serve this movie? That nauseating scene makes the scene in Fatal Attraction look tame. There are no solutions offered nor is there much in the way of analysis of the issues. In his own way, Moore is every bit as elitist as the figures that he caricatures throughout the movie. A shameful manipulation that could only have been made to feed Moore's monstrous ego."
2,At least MM is consistent,"Once again another MM project that has a few, good points. That's it people, a few, good points. The problem is then his points are wasted because of a smug, arrogant attitude. This is a constant theme in all his work. Those of you who think it's ""hilarious"" do not understand capitalism - or worse yet have some kind of problem with a company that makes a profit. MM has a personal axe to grind over Flint, Michigan, and he does this well. Bottom line, it's easy to gripe and rant when something doesn't work. It's harder to provide solutions. Thanks Mike."
2,kjdfjhsdfgsd,"I think that the movie was pretty good because it tells the truth abuot Roger, He is really greedy. He shut the warehouse down so he did not have to pay 30,000 people. And I think that it did a lot to the comminity they lost money the crime rate went up and tons of people got evicted because of this. I think it was the worst thing that Roger could do to that comminity."
3,Warning: Live rabbit killed and skinned - very graphic scene,I was very much enjoying watching Roger and Me until a live rabbit was killed and skinned in the movie! The scene seemed to go on forever.What a shame that an otherwise great documentary was ruined by this unnecessary and offensive scene. The point could have been made without the graphic footage.
4,Gone now,"A thinner, shaved Michael Moore goes after Roger Smith of General Motors for ignoring the plight of the people of Flint, Michigan. A comical look at the 80's, though a real downer of a movie, especially the Christmas scenes. Hard to imagine a bigger scrooge, though I see no reason why anything would be different all these years later. I wonder what Smith would say about F911Michael Durankowww.bootism.com"
3,Good Movie,"I been reading an economics book named economics Samuelson & Nordhaus and i one of their pages they talk about this movie.I think is good movie, great job and it talks about the problem of families at the moment the companys go out of the town is a movie to think about the problem the expansion provocate,i recomend to you."
3,I don't get it,"I know this movie was a brilliant condemnation of the evils of capitalism but I don't get it. What is Mr. Moore's answer, that GM keep the Flint plant open even though the union worker's wages and the quality of their work meant that no one would buy a car made there? Is the GM spokesmen who says that America is the land of freedom and opportunity the villian? Are the unemployed auto workers who sit there dumbstruck the heroes? If so, I don't get it. But then there is alot going on that I don't get."
2,Roger & Me,"Good movie, sometimes a little slow, I hardly belive i would see it if I havent see Bowling for columbine and F.911, However Michael Moore shows you with comedy and irony how he starts to be the great movie filmer that he becomes."
4,Lots of info,"This is Michael's first documentery, before he became nationaly famous. And the way he were's the same cloths he did ten years ago as he does now. That's one of the things great about him. The movie takes place in Flint, Michigan, the birth place of General Motors and several celebraties. At the beginning of the movie, Rogger Morris (president of GM) decides to close the factories in Flint, but not without Michael trying to talk to him. This is the bases of the movie, Michael Moore chases Roger around the nation (hence the name Roger and Me). During this time Michael is trying to find Roger, Flint becomes over populated with unemployed and homeless. It's kinda sad to see disaster strike this town, but overall, it's a great documentery."
2,Roger & ... Count Me Out,"I give it a point for an occasional insight into Rust Belt America and the corporations that tighten that belt. However, in general this film is wildly overrated. It is long, tedious, preachy, and just plain dull. You were expecting a comedy?? Ha. Barely a chuckle or two. Roger & out."
1,Manipulative,"This is not a documentary, any more than the 1930s works of Leni Riefenstahl were documentaries. It is cleverly manipulated, cleverly-designed socialist propaganda by one of the biggest blowhards in the film industry.Yes, Flint MI was hit hard by layoffs. So were a number of other rust belt towns (including my hometown). But if this was a true documentary, Mr. Moore might have examined some of the reasons for plant closures other than the greed of General Motors. Had he the courage to dig beneath the surface, he might have discovered greed of a different sort - e.g. that of the UAW top guns who dictated horrendously stupid, inflexible work rules.Also lacking is any discussion of greed at the government level, which taxes corporations to death. I guess when your objective is to uphold paternalistic government, you tend to cherry pick history to support that view, and that's what Mr. Moore has done here. Not fun."
1,If you like propaganda videos...,"you'll love this one! Michael Moore has a few good points in this movie, but he never mentions, say, GM's legal obligation to the stockholders to maximize shareholder value. Basically the ""documentary"" is more centered around his upset feelings at how the world works, making it long, drawn out, and fairly boring."
1,...,"What exactly was the purpose of this movie? Was it trying to help the poor working class of Flint? If Americans are going to be pro-proletariat I don't see why such antipathy for communism. So what if the pitiful slave rebellion succeeded? In the godless ephemerality of human life wether they all perish or continue to contaminate planet earth- what does it matter? If you gave in to be an american machinistic slave of a job, you might as well expect to be treated like a slave. What is wrong with Roger Smith? A cunning ingenious businessman if you ask me. The sarcasm, though I usually receive sarcasm well, was vomit-inducing. Stories with morals never fare well, and it is for humans like Moore that I wish hell existed; but alas it does not. Rebel- a mindless american romantic loose term pertaining to muckrakers. Who's concern is it about Moore, Flint, and muckrakers? A torturous classroom experience."
1,here we go again,"If only Mikey would have concentrated on relieving the burdens on our corporations so it would be profitable to hire workers. Frankly, I don't know what he's bitching about, the unionized ""workers"" of Flint were always unemployed, just now they're not getting paid for doing nothing."
5,Roger & Me,"This represents what is truly wrong within this country. The USA is a greedy kinda country forged via genocide and slavery where we say one thing and do another. It shows without a doubt that freedom of speech, equality and liberty and justice for all are but meaningless rhetoric."
5,I can't believe I didn't see this movie until now (2002),"No wonder this film put Michael Moore on the map. It's brilliantly conceived & executed. Great editing, dialogue, etc. Every CEO in the US should be made to watch this film. For the record, I think corporations should have some kind of responsibility to the community. Otherwise, as MM partly points out in this film, our jobs will just keep going to Mexico or elsewhere."
3,A Michael Moore Documentary,I am a collector of Michael Moore's documentaries but I try to keep my ratings unbiased. Moore has made some great movies and some not so outstanding.
4,Cut Mowing Time from 2-1/2 hours to 1-1/4 hours,"I bought this mower after owning a Poulan 25HP, 48"" Deck mower. This zero turn cut my time from 2-1/2 hours to 1-1/4. This machine is great. I now mow at 5-6 MPH. I live on 2-1/2 acreas with lots of trees. Since buying this mower my trim push mower has not been used. Watch out when your are going down hill. If you go too fast you will lose control and run into anything in the way. This thing also cuts the lawn like a golf course. My neighbor owns a golf course and made that comment to me.Buy this thing!"
1,Junk,"I have owned my share of computers , Dell, H P , Home made. Picked this up 2700 chip 16 gig,what a waste of money. Slow, nothing but trouble with E-Mail, moving files a joke. Spend your money on another system."
2,Just coasting on a legend...,"One of the weakest punk ""reunion"" albums of the 90s this version of X Ray Spex sounds nothing like their incredible 1978 LP. This more recalls Blondie (c.79-80) with a hint of the Banshies (c.81). Rank this along side Slaughter & the Dogs' disapointing ""Shocking"" (1991). If you want to hear some GOOD 90s stuff from 70s punt vets check out Buzzcocks' ""Trade Test Transmission"", the Damned's ""Not of This Earth"" and the Misfits' ""American Psycho""."
2,flat and uninvolving,"This novel never really shifted into second gear. There were few surprises, much of the plot was painfully obvious, and there were far too many descriptions of insignificant things. There was not much sense of menace or suspense in this so-called horror novel, and the climax felt rushed and tacked on. A major disappointment from this usually stellar author."
1,Pact of the Fathers poorly written,"This book was a disappointment. It was poorly written and because of that, hard to follow. I don't mean the plot was hard to follow. It wasn't. The writing itself was so bad it was unpleasant to read. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they have several hours out of their life to completely waste. Shame on this publisher or editor!"
4,Solid Campbell...but don't read the book jacket,"Enjoyable non-supernatural Campbell...solid, compelling story. Unfortunately, it utterly failed to keep me in suspense because the Tor jacket notes divulge every mystery the book has to offer; it's not until around page 300 that you get past anything not already spelled out on the liner. Whoever wrote that copy and allowed it to be published has no respect for the care that Campbell took in trying to build a mood of suspense. I envy whoever got to read this without already knowing in advance what it was about."
4,Great Costume,The costume fit perfectly after I chose the size according to measurements. My daughter loved it and was the only girl ninja in her class full of the usual princesses!
1,its nice but tieing it is a pain not recomended,In order for me to tie my daughters costume i had to cut off one of the ties and tie both of them together. It didn't really give me the look i was going for. everything else was fine but tie was a pretty big issue if you would see it. However my five year old did love it :)oh and the dragon stuck to gether i had to pull it apart and part of the dragon ripped off it was minor but still and issue.
4,Better material than many costumes,"Sturdier material than many costumes. The jacket was a bit heavier material, which is nice, but pants were very long."
4,Girl's Ninja Costume,"I bought this costume for my 7 year old daughter. Her 9 year old brother was going to be a ninja for Halloween, so of course she wanted to be one too. The costume is really cute and the quality is better than one would expect for a $12 costume. I have one complaint though, there was no opening in the one side of the top for the sash part to go through and wrap around, which made tying it impossible. However, it took me some scissors and my sewing machine and about 5 minutes to correct this and add one. Over all, nice costume."
1,Boring!,This is hardly jazzy in any way. The vocals are very hard sounding when her volume increases. And all the cuts sound pretty much the same. Check out the Sarah Vaughn or Ella Fitzgerald versions of these songs and see how truly awful these renditions are.
2,More like Keep to Yourself,"I have been a Ronstadt fan since the early 70's, and although the Nelson Riddle stage and the Mexican stage were not my style, I still loved her vocal perfection. This is truly the only album I haven't played more than twice (I didn't like it the first time, which surprised me, so I tried it again). It doesn't showcase her voice or her talents. The songs are very ho hum. Linda, put out a Christmas album (been waiting for years), and try to get sweetness back for this old fan."
5,Loved it,Everyone I know who has listened to this CD has enjoyed it very much. Hope for more of this type.
2,AN OLD FRIEND DISAPOINTS,"This CD is aptly titled. A collection of nice songs that Linda didnt seem to care too much about. Just as one might hum an old tune to oneself while doing something more important - not something that you would want anyone else to necessarily hear.I guess I yearn for that fire that used to burn in her and you could hear even in her ballads. Just compare this very flat rendition of Cry Me A River with Diana Krall's and you can see what we are all missing. I still love her for the past joy and her current spunk (the Las Vegas incident), but in this CD she is just ""mailing it in""."
2,Hit&Miss,Linda Ronstadt is a very versatiel artist who has tried all types of styles of music in the past.I have a older standards set she did that is better than this.she seems to be going through the motions.but having said that she still is better at pulling this style of Project Music making than other acts like Rod Stewart.I always give it up for Linda Ronstadt's ability to try different things with her Work.
4,Croon Under the Moon,"Ronstadt's first outing for Verve is often a quiet interlude with a small combo. My favorite track is the title tune that was #1 in my own personal top ten! Dan Block's clarinet swings mercilessly making this the most joyful track in the set with Linda's sunny vocals, ""I got the words & I got the tune & I like to croon it under the moon!"" ""Cry Me A River"" sounds lovely in her masterful hands while Bob Mann milks the guitar. ""Blue Prelude"" is another delightful jewel which Christian McBride's bass navigates in these bluesy waters masterfully. Ronstadt sounds like she had a head cold on ""Get Out of Town"" that somehow suits the zippy arrangement that bursts forth about a minute into the song. I tend to prefer the uptempo numbers; so not every track on this set knocks me flat. However, there are enough shining moments here that it is well worth adding to your the soundtrack of your life! :) Enjoy!"
5,This is a first class journey into jazz and great singing,"Linda seems to select material that is time-less and sings with a voice that is moving and angelic. Her phrase-ology is reminiscent of Judy Garland and Sinatra. perfectly articulated with just the right emotion and nuance. This is a GEM, BUY IT, it is great while driving, and also a romantic date."
2,Too brassy,"There is only one number on this album in which Linda Ronstadt's technique of shouting the lyrics--which stood her in such good stead throughout her rock'n'roll career--almost works. It is a sad commentary, however, that I am not inclined to go back and listen just to determine which song that is. Suffice it to say that it usually doesn't do to shout jazz. Not all '60s rock divas make poor jazz performers; Rita Coolidge's album ""And So Is Love"" has several near perfect tracks even if the entire album is not perfect. Whereas I intend to listen to Rita again, I won't listen to ""Hummin'"" again if I can help it."
1,"What do Ronstadt, Feinstein, Stewarat, Manilow, Midler, & Tenille have in common","They all tried to save dying pop/rock careers by singing jazz standards, and beleive you me, none of them are up to standard, fot singing standards. You 1st need a atural sense of swing ehich of all of them only Midler has somewhat naturally. Manilow and Feinstein are the worst, for thier lack of rhythm and imagination. Stewart is the flat out worst all around,Tenille just stinks, Ronstadt is second best after Midler, even though she sounds nothing like a pro at lest while singing classics like the title song. She propablty should do another album of mariachis, for gringos who won't know the difference between her and Ana Gabriel. Skip any of her standard albums, and buy the original 50's artists."
1,"keep on hummin' to yourself, but don't make us listen...","Ronstadt singing old jazz standards makes about as much sense as her out of wack liberal left wing communist un-American political views. 1st off sh hasn't got the natural sense of swing, and doesn;t know how to phrase a ""jazz standard"", she sounds unprfessional, and can't even pronounce the words correctly. As jazz critic Friedwald has pointed out, even when she hired jazz arranger Nelson Riddle to arrange for her, it only made her sound taht much more ametueristic. Skip this one, and if you are a fan you probably like her doing her hits, or even her mariachi stuff, which suits her better, but it should be illegal for her and Toni Tennille to touch anything by Gershwin, Porter, Berlin, exe..."
5,Linda's Back in Style!,"This is another incredible album by Linda. There is only ONE criticism.... and that is she waits too long to give us these gems! The reviews written by other positive reviewers are right on target. Thank you Linda for your beautiful renditions here, which are romantic, marvelous and sensitive. NOW... can Linda give us an album of the forgotten and GORGEOUS songs of Antonio Carlos Jobim? HER VOICE would work magic with ""How Insensitive"", ""Once I Loved"", ""Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars"" and ""Sabia""."
2,Does Not Fit Correctly,"My Igloo cooler is 120 quarts, and the replacement part bracket has a different hole pattern. Because of this, I only used the new handles and the old bracket, mainly because I did not want to drill more new holes into the cooler itself. Therefore, I'm not happy with the replacement parts, but used what I could anyway."
2,"Good Light, Poor Mount",I bought one of these back in Sept 2007. The lights work OK (though they seem to drain the batteries faster than a Planet Bike Super Spot). My problem was that a good bounce or accidental hit to the light caused the thin molded mounting fins on the light body to break off. I went thru two lights in about two weeks. It must be a design flaw. I now have two very nice hand held flash lights.
1,Too Good to be True,"It seemed odd that the Amazon price ($44.99)was 1/2 of Bike Nashbar's ($99.95) for this item, but I figured Amazon has some sort of bulk discount purchasing, so I ordered despite the 3-6 week wait time. A few days later an email from Amazon told me my item has had been shipped. Wow, I thought, I really got a deal on this! However when the package arrived and I opened it up it made sense why the price was so low. Despite explicitly describing the rechargable version on the website, Amazon shipped the standard version with no recharger and disposable batteries. A lenghty conversation with an Amazon representative on the Indian subcontinent ensued. She was nice enough about the whole thing, but save yourself the trouble and order through Nashbar and get what you are looking for."
4,Brightest for the buck.,"This was the brightest when comparing to several others under $60. It works well with AA rechargeable batteries. I strongly recommend to NOT use the flashing sidelights. A couple cars pulled out in front of me. One driver yelled out ""your turn signal is on"". I then realized he was referring to the right flashing sidelight. I now have tape over them for safety. The mounting clip appears to be fragile. I haven't broken it yet, but I'm being real careful. The quality of the light itself is good."
2,Powerful light with a flimsy clip,"Great light for nighttime use, lasts about 4-5 hours on rechargeable 2300 mAh Duracells. The clip is garbage though. The light is very bulky due to the 4 AA batteries being housed in the body, and the clip's swivel is not adjustable. The ridiculously small screw that held the base and clip together broke after 4 months of light usage (used the light maybe twice a week)."
3,demolition dirging,"a good looking collection from one of the truly original ska punk bands,unfortunately good track listing is compromised by poor quality,worth having for completists but for a true reflection of the power and tunefulness of the ruts stick to studio recordings"
4,Knightfall is my favorite,"Having been familiar with comics my whole life, my favorite was Batman's Knightfall saga, in which the brand new rookie here in this toy Bane breaks Bruce Wayne's back. You may laugh at this toy, but some people who are not just kids seriously like these. Much the same as with Barbie dolls."
2,"Great interaction, low quality.","Our family uses alot of Baby Einstein products and have always been happy with the quality. Unfortunately, their swing is the exception.The interactive toys are designed very well and we loved the mobile, but after a couple weeks, we noticed the motor started making alot of noise and barely worked depending on the speed setting, even with fresh batteries.I place blame on the Graco motor, it just doesn't seem to have what it takes to get the job done, and our son only weighs 13 pounds. The ""side motor"" design, while giving you more room to take baby in and out of the seat, seems very poor. We exchanged this swing for a Fisher Price model (same price) with the swing suspended from the motor and are ecstatic at the performance of this model.My ideal would be for Baby Einstein to team up with Fisher Price instead of Graco and make a great quality swing with the interactive toys we have come to love!"
1,Terrible,The book arrived water damaged. It looks horrible. I will not order again. I can hardly read the words of the first part of the book. I can not believe the condition of the book.
3,Why mismatched items?,"As with the previous reviewer, I think the items are nice. I especially like the ""Rainforest Friends"" pattern and think it is very cute. So, why does it come with cap/booties of another design? I received this as a gift, but am tempted to return for items that match!"
5,Superb Family Movie,"I saw this film quite accidentally one evening while channel surfing and became engrossed in the story almost immediately. It is a disarmingly entertaining tale about a pilot who becomes lost over the Pacific Ocean in his small plane and seems certain to die as his plane is running out of fuel. His only hope is a resourceful and determined Air New Zealand commercial pilot who happens onto the unfolding drama, along with his planeload of passengers. The commercial pilot has to convince the Cessna pilot not to give up when everything looks hopeless and, at the same time, convince skeptical passengers that this is an effort worth taking a risk on. Overall, the story is gripping and highly entertaining. The final outcome is very inspiring and the movie as a whole provides a great message about what great and moral leadership is all about. A film you will want to watch with your children over and over."
5,Great TV Flick (Mercy Mission),"I have been awaiting this to come out on dvd for a while now. It stars Robert Loggia and Scott Bakula. Bakula is flying a single engine plane to another destination in the blackness of night over the ocean. He then encounters some problems with his plane and Loggia, who is Captain of a jet liner, offers his help. Won't say how it ends. This is an excellent tv movie that is full of suspense and tension. I highly recommend it. I don't think you'll be disappointed. My 5-star rating is based on the quality of it being a tv movie. You don't find many like this one. Not sure if I have seen ""Nowhere To Land"" so I won't rate that one.By The Way: These are not Widescreen, they are Full Screen TV movies."
5,DOUBLE EMOTION!!,"This DVD is very, very good! Two films about airplane stories and one inspired in real life!My favourite is ""Mercy Mission"" where Scott Bakula and the veteran Robert Loggia are great! Scott is the pilot of a small airplane lost in the Pacific Ocean who is helped to safely land by a commercial airline senior pilot. It is really touching. Watch it if you have not done it yet. It's marvelous!! The second film is not as wonderful as the first one but is worth seeing, indeed. ""Nowhere to land"" is the story of of a flight from Australia to the USA where a maniac ex-husband of one of the passengers hides a gas bomb inside the plane and cowardly leaves the aircraft before it takes off. The fight of the pilot and co-pilot to take the plane safely to land in LA before the gas spreads all over is what makes us watching this good film up to the very end!"
3,Slow,"I found this book to be too slow. I had to work to get through it. There was too much description of mundane things and not enough action. I have purchased ""B Is For Burglar"" and will give the series another try. I know this is an older book, but I hope Grafton's writing style improves."
3,"Attractive heroine, but a little disappointing story","First of all, I'd better tell I like Kinsey Millhone. She is so tough and honest with her instinct and intuition. Unlike the other heroines which has magnificent titles and elegant life style, she struggles to survive everyday.But talking on the plot, it's not so attractive and exciting as much as Kinsey. The plot seems to be heard before and there are some moments for me to feel like putting aside.But, It's the first book and case for Kinsey. So I defer more criticism on this series, because she might show more in the late volumes.."
2,"uhhh, ok",If you've read enough private investigator novels you know that this isn't the best one... She doesn't fool around with the genre like most good authors do and she relies on formula in her first novel... I knew the killer the moment she met... her/him... You should too... Decent Style but Robert Parker and Dennis Lehane are better modern day PI novelists
4,A is for Alibi,"I was really surprised to read all the bad reviews for this book. This was my first of Sue Grafton's books and I enjoyed it very much. After reading all of Patricia Cornwell's novels, I was afraid that I won't find another author whom I will like that much. Now I can't wait to keep buying and reading her other novels. I admit, her style is a bit slow, but give here a chance, ""A"" was her first book! I think the character Kinsey is hilarious and smart and of course, I love the fact that she's a woman!"
3,Good beginning to series... but book isn't fantastic,"I liked Kinsey. She is a good character, and I think that I'll enjoy reading as her character changes and grows in the rest of the novels.The story was OK, although the characters other than Kinsey were kind of one-dimensional. Also, I expected her to have some kind of social circle with friends, etc. and other characters that would weave through the following novels - but as of yet, we haven't been introduced to anyone.As a mystery novel goes, I give it a 3 - not the best, but far from the worst. But, I am looking forward to reading more of this series - I see great potential here."
2,Tight plot - but I was disappointed by characters,"I was disappointed by this book despite the very positive reviews on this page. The plot was entertaining and tightly constructed, but the characters didn't match up: I felt I'd read about them all (or rather seen them on '70s detective TV shows) too many times before."
4,An okay start to the series;,"The first book in the Kinsey Millhone series. Kinsey Millhone is hired by a woman to investigate the murder of her philandering husband who she was tried and convicted of killing. Eight years have went by since his murder, but Kinsey still agrees to take the case.Finally got around to reading this. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, but I kept getting these weird ""Anita Blake""-ish vibes from the book. The heroines are so smiliar in thought to me. Maybe Ms. Hamilton read these books as well? Nothing to deep and thought provoking here. A nice little whodunit, even if the killer was pretty obvious to me.It was nice to see a story where the main focus wasn't the hero's love life, leaving the main plot of the story secondary. I'll definitely check out more in this series."
3,A is for Average,"It takes a superior writer with excellent chacterization skills to keep things lively when the plot basically consists of our PI hero conducting an interminable series of one-on-one interviews. Kinsey Millhone is not a very distinctive character here and author Sue Grafton buries her inquiries in an avalanche of trivial detail. Every time Kinsey goes somewhere, Grafton gives us driving directions that would do Mapquest proud. We read about the decor of everyplace Kinsey visits and learn the menu of every meal she eats. We are 100 pages into the novel before anything even vaguely exciting happens--and even then Kinsey's actions are not very logical. I was prepared to give this novel a much lower rating but I quite enjoyed the last 50 pages, including the abrupt conclusion. This story just took much too long to get moving."
2,Needs work,"I recently finished a Mary Higgins Clark book before I started to read Sue Grafton's 'A' is for Alibi. Why is it that mystery writers, in general, use the same plot twist for an ending? I liked Kinsey, but I didn't like the rest of the one-dimensional characters. I also didn't like all the descriptiveness in the book. The reader doesn't need to know every little detail and I get the feeling the author is being descriptive in order to fill in the holes of a very thin plot. I don't want to give too much away in case some one else might care to read it."
2,S is for snore....,I had wanted to read one of Sue Grafton's books for a while. A friend is an avid reader of these books. I guess the story line just didn't work for me. It might be a good book for me to read the next time I have a plane flight.
1,It tries just a little to hard.,"In my opinion the book starts of an OK note and then moves on to poor plot twists. The characters didn't exhibit much thought and the main character gets sidetracked by kinky toss ins. The end was a majior no brainer and not worth waiting for. As a whole, Private I Kinsey could be something but not if the auther is going to keep trying too hard to make this book cliche."
5,excellent review,This is an older book that I read some years ago. I wanted to start over again at the beginning with the A book. Item was received promptly and was as described.
3,A quick and easy read,"This is a new author for me, and it is also the first book in the ""Alphabet"" aka ""Kinsey Millhone"" series.It was a quick, enjoyable, easy read for me. The detective is likeable. Pretty light stuff, nothing really disturbing or heavy. I plan to read more of the series.The narrator, Mary Peiffer, did a nice job.MY RATING: 3.5 stars!"
5,Sue Grafton's heroine Kinsey Millhone,"righter of wrongs, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, more powerful than a locomotive, criminals beware, one"
2,A is for All right,"I had heard great things about the alphabet books; however, I was disappointed. I found the stories lacking in the ability to get the reader addicted to the plot. I made myself finish it, but it is not something I will read again."
4,excellent first book,"For a first book, I think she did a wonderful job. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I figured out who the murderer was early on in the book (maybe it was just a fluke). Her main character, Kinsey Millhone, is a private investigator who is twice divorced. She is hired by a woman who has been released from prison after being convicted of murdering her husband. She says she didn't do it and wants Kinsey to find the real murderer. There had been a second murder later that was similar to that of her husbands and Kinsey decides to look into that angle as well. There is the usual murder and mayhem that follows. I have read several of her books but never this one and I wasn't disappointed. She makes the character of Kinsey Millhone very believable and likable with all its foibles and goodness. I really enjoyed the book. A nice fast and easy read that kept you interested to the end."
3,A Is For Alibi,"Kinsey Millhone is a tough private detective who's asked by Nikki Fife to investigate a murder she was imprisoned for. Nikki wants the real killer found, and her name cleared. The victim, Nikki's husband, is a man with a checkered past. Kinsey takes the case, but is sidetracked romantically when she has an attraction to one of the suspects. After a second corpse is found, Kinsey realizes she will have to put her life on the line to get to the truth. Who really killed Nikki's husband? Is Kinsey's new boyfriend involved? This adult murder mystery has a well-devised plot, and quirky characters. The setting was a fictitious town in California, but the images made you feel like you were there. The drawbacks: far too many descriptions and the story dragged on. It needed more excitement."
3,average,"This is an okay book. Nothing more. The story is weighed down too often by needless description. I'm not against description, but does every single house need to be described down to the color and texture of the walls? You could tell it was a novice writer trying to ""flesh out"" her book.Also, at times, Millhone is just not a very likable character. Not in a good way, either. She seems petty and small.A is for average, begin with B."
3,I enjoyed this mystery.,"This is the first Sue Grafton book that I have ever read. It was good. I plan to go on to ""B"" is for Burglar soon. The ending of this book did surprise me. My biggest problrm with it is that Kinsey Millhone is sometimes a bit unrefined as a character, but I feel that she will develope as I read more of her stories."
2,disappointing read,"As an avid book reader and lover of mysteries I must say I was very disappointed in this book. I had heard so much about Sue Grafton's ""alphabet"" books that I couldn't wait to read one. I can't say I would read another. Not enough character development & too many characters made for a rather slow-paced and dull book. I would at least like to care about the characters - especially if they're going to live or die. In this case, none mattered. You never felt anything towards them. I found Kinsey very boring. Characterize her a little more, Ms. Grafton if you want us to care. Maybe since it is the first she wrote, I can cut her a break and try the next letter. Hopefully, I'll have more luck. I can't say I would waste any time on this first one."
2,Boring,"I bought ABCDEFGHIJKLMO several years ago and now am free to start from A, A is for alibi. I must say that this is almost the most boring detective novels I've ever read. The plot is predictable (and many times too coincident to believe), the roles are stereotype. Our heroine detective, Kinsey, who is self-assertive, self-reliant, self-willed and self-important, is not attractive at all. The only thing this book differs with others is that our heroine did a lot of chores and is very good, sometimes too good, at guessing."
3,Good Modern Detective,"This is a good detective story with a lively and well-characterized female protagonist. I would give it more stars, but I get really bored with the obligatory postmodernist foul language."
3,A Bit of a Weak Start to a Very Good Series,"I first read S, then some time later T. Liking them both a great deal, I decided to read the series over time. Like others, I feel the novel a bit weakly written. But, let's be fair here. Ms. Grafton is up to U & we're well into the 21st century. Alibi was written in 1982; quite some time ago.Ms. Grafton was much more a novice back then & developing the character of Kinsey Millhone, as well as her writing style & skills. For the first in a long series & freshly out of the gate, the book isn't great. It has the most abrupt ending I've ever read. But, it's not bad either. It's a quick read that launched a very good series"
3,Not bad for first in a series,"I have read all of the Sue Grafton alphabet series except for the last one. This is the first of the series and the least likeable. I liked the characters but the storyline was too pat. Luckily, with each succeeding book, the characters are developed even more along with better story lines and better endings. If you plan on reading the whole series, you'll need to trudge through this one to help get the feel.Like I said, it's not the best of the series, but it's not bad either."
2,disappointing read,"As an avid book reader and lover of mysteries I must say I was very disappointed in this book. I had heard so much about Sue Grafton's ""alphabet"" books that I couldn't wait to read one. I can't say I would read another. Not enough character development & too many characters made for a rather slow-paced and dull book. I would at least like to care about the characters - especially if they're going to live or die. In this case, none mattered. You never felt anything towards them. I found Kinsey very boring. Characterize her a little more, Ms. Grafton if you want us to care. The ending of the book is probably one of the worst I've seen in awhile. ""I blew him away"". Yikes, is that the best you could come up with? Maybe since it is the first she wrote, I can cut her a break and try the next letter. Hopefully, I'll have more luck. I can't say I would waste any time on this first one."
3,Breezy read,"Sue Grafton has crafted an enjoyable story about a murder case resurrected 8 years after the convicted, but innocent killer is released from prison. The novel's lead, Kinsey Millhone (PI), finds herself struggling to put the pieces of the crime together that left a divorce lawyer and up and coming accounting star dead. What's worse is that Kinsey's leads keep turning up dead.You'll have to read through the twists and turns to find out how the investigation ends, but 'A' is for Alibi is an easy and entertaining read for those who like a good mystery."
3,for Brother Fred,"A Is for Alibi is an easy as well as entertaining read. It was the first book I read in two days, not only because I had to. The plot structure is typical of most mystery novels, the one standardized by Poe. It begins with the introduction of Kinsley Milhone (since it is the first of the series), and the situation of the ex-convict that hired her. The book starts off slow with Kinsley doing backround and case file checks. Throughout the novel, one is completely thrown off by the cituations surrounding the murder itself, especially the fact that there were actually two related murders performed in the same fashion. A unique aspect of the novel is the interesting way Kinsley-who is also the narrator-describes her surroundings and her feelings toward cituations..."
1,Boring,This would have to be one of the worst books I have ever read. A complete waste of time to read .
1,'B' is for boring!!!,"I didn't enjoy this ""supposedly"" great mystery at all. Truth is, I couldn't even force myself to complete it. How did Ms. Grafton ever become so popular? Get in line behind Mary Higgins Clark, Sue, she knows how to write page turners."
5,Wow of an Ending!,"Grafton's first novel in the Kinsey Millhone series depicts the tedious footwork of the private eye without being tedious. Her characters are well drawn and interesting against Kinsey herself who is quirky, edgy, bright, and funny . I loved her! Not at all feminine, Kinsey is an unusual woman in a non traditional job who captures the reader's interest and earns his or her respect. The ending was the best!"
2,.Zzzzzz ...,This was my first trial of the alphabet crime stories I found it slow and boring. Maybe it appeals more to women than to men.
4,A is for Alibi,"A is for Alibi by Sue Grafton really held my interest, a real page turner and could not put it down."
3,not bad,This was the first book that I have read by Sue Grafton and it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I will read more of her books but not sure yet if I will read them all. I love to read mysteries but this one seemed to be missing something for me. Maybe the next one will be better.
3,A is for Alibi,"I found this book to be very boring. It's a quick read; however, the flow of the book is very slow and tedious. The only reason I did finish the book was because I really wanted to find out who killed Nikki's husband. After reading Book A, I'm not sure I can stand to read another one of these books if they all go at this same slow rate."
3,Interesting story,"I have been wanting to read Sue Grafton for awhile but I kept putting it off because my father didn't care for her books. I didn't love the book yet I didn't hate the book either. A is for Alibi was an enjoyable read. I will try her books again.This story is about a PI, Kinsey Millhone, who is hired by a woman, Nikki Fife, who was found guilty of murdering her husband. Nikki hires Kinsey to prove that she was innocent. As Kinsey starts looking at everyone that knew Nikki's husband back then I had a gut feeling that I knew who had killed Mr. Fife. I just had that feeling from the way the person interacted with Kinsey. That made the book a little boring because I just wanted to know if I was right.The book got suspenseful when I had about 3 chapters left to read. The ending of the story was different from what I am used to when reading a mystery. I was glad to see that I was right about who had committed the murder.Since the book took me awhile to read I gave the book 3 1/2 stars."
4,Kinsey is My Favorite PI,"As the first in the series of Alphabet Mysteries, Sue Grafton just begins to ""flesh-out"" the Kinsey Millhone character. I really liked this book and although the antagonist was predictable, I enjoyed getting to know the characters involved in this novel, as many of these characters will be seen again in the later books in this series. This book sets a groundwork for the later novels and gives some basic insight into Millhone's motivations which are expounded in later novels. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this as I have all of Sue Grafton's works. This would have gotton 5 stars if the outcome hadn't been so predictable."
3,A different sort of Detective...,"Although I had guessed who the killer was at barely the beginning of the third chapter, I had been wrong about my guess of motive. The ending surprised me and was not as wrapped up as I would like from a mystery. It was a quick read, though, and worth the time.Also, I really like the Kinsey Millhone character. She is very straightforward and blunt. I like that the author is willing to let her make mistakes (big ones)."
2,A is for Average,"Sue Grafton's alphabet books start off very slowly and I wasn't that impressed with the first few. I stuck with it, though, and read all the way to ""V"", her latest in the series, and have really enjoed them as they have gone along."
1,Disappointing...,"When I spotted these books in the library, I was excited to find a plentiful mystery series upon which to embark, but I really don't know if I will go beyond this book. Kinsey Millhone is unlikeable and unpleasant. The fact that she doesn't like dogs is enough to put me off seriously, but generally, she is just not a heroine I would give a flip about.This is a short book (200 pages) peopled by an apparent ""cast of thousands"", and there is not enough character development to firmly establish many of them. Every time a character is mentioned, I find myself saying ""Who the heck is that?"" and flipping back through the book to find the initial reference.The book was readable, but not a page-turner."
1,Review,I did not really like this book. I thought it was slow and boring. I don't think I'll be reading any more of these books.
3,Gripping,"I normally find the suspense/thriller type book tedious to read but this was easy to start, the characters have a real independent personality and aren't cliched stereotypes of the authors imagination. And the ending had me wide awake at 2am!"
3,Gotta start somewhere...,"I am a fan of this series, but I have to admit that its first installment was a bit weak. Had I read this one before the series had built up some momentum, I probably wouldn't have bothered to move on to B is for Burglar. Many of the plot points had a contrived feel to them, and Kinsey often acted out of character. I think those moments were also the result of attempts at plot manipulation that just didn't work out too well.The thing is, though, that the series as a whole is quite good, and it's just a shame that its beginning is less than spectacular. That's why I always recommend that new Grafton readers start off with G is for Gumshoe and then go back to the start of the series once they know what treats they are in for later."
5,"A good, light read","I bought this book on an impulse since I had a long trip ahead of me and needed something to occupy my mind, but yet wasn't so deep I'd need total silence to drink it in. This was perfect, and I wound up enjoying the story so much I finished it in 24 hours. True, it was fairly predictable - I knew immediately who the ""big baddie"" was going to be, and the supporters - but I enjoyed the fact that I had guessed so soon that I actually didn't cheat and peek at the end, and instead highly enjoyed seeing how and if my suspicions fit into the plot!Don't buy it expecting deep genius, but don't expect a dime store novel either. It's right in between and I had a fun enough time that I think I'll pick up the next one in the series."
2,STILL TRYING TO LIKE GRAFTON,"I SEEM TO BE UNABLE TO REALLY GET ANY KIND OF RUSH FROM GRAFTON. SHE GOES ON AND ON DESCRIBING EVERY LITTLE THING,WHAT SOMETHING LOOKS LIKE ,OR TASTES LIKE, ANY LITTLE THING, THAT MOST TIMES HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE STORY, SO I FIND MYSELF SKIMMING THROUGH A LOT. MAYBE ANOTHER ONE WILL BE OF MORE INTEREST, I HAVE READ TWO, SO, I'LL GIVE IT ONE MORE TRY, I KNOW MANY READERS ENJOY HER, BUT NOT THIS READER SO FAR--"
2,Lacking in style and mystery,"Although Sue Grafton has a good start with her character Kinsey Millhone, the rest of the book is lacking. The plot was overly simple, and the description of the actual murder did not live up to the build that Grafton provided. The murderer caved in much too easily, and little evidence existed against the criminals. In addition, the style wavers between that suitable for a ""cheap, leisure novel"" and a fairly sophisticated ""intellectual novel."""
3,Kinsey is no Stephanie Plum,"I've heard so much about Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone series that I decided to give A Is for Alibi a try. I thought that this series might be a bit like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, but ""a bit"" is about the extent of similarity between the two. Both have female protagonists, and both Kinsey and Stephanie are trying to solve mysteries. However, Kinsey is a well-respected, serious sleuth, and Stephanie is a hilarious bumbler. Stephanie has no qualms about mixing sex with work, but at least in this first volume, Kinsey recognizes the difficulty of trying to be objective when her paramour is a suspect. Nikki Fife has paid her debt to society with 8 years behind bars for the murder of her husband and has hired Kinsey to find out who really did it. Is anyone serving time for murder paroled after 8 years?? Both series are of the light fiction variety, and both are enjoyable in a mindless way. I still prefer Stephanie, but I know her better. Kinsey may grow on me."
2,'A' is for Alibi,"Received on time if not early. Book looked like it was in good condition. However, it was old and brittle. Literally fell apart as I read it. I would check the source of where you purchased this book or others from the same source. They will all probably disintegrate."
1,A is for Alibi,"I love these books, but this one time I was sent a remedial book which left alot to desired."
2,A Slow Start,"'A is for Alibi is a shallow beginning to a very enjoyable mystery series. In the first of the Kinsey Millhone mysteries Grafton introduces her female detective through an investigation of a murder case closed eight years before. While the plot is interesting, the brevity of the novel leaves the narrative feeling underdeveloped. The characters are intriguing, but the ease with which Millhone forms relationships with other characters is grossly unbelievable, creating the sensation that the reader has walked in mid-story, missing a great deal of background. While 'A' is for Alibi is not terrible on its own, the Kinsey Millhone series is one that improves greatly as it progresses."
1,Not Enough to Hold My Interest,"I tried...I really tried, but the book just never grabbed my attention. It isn't so much Grafton's writing style, but the story was slow and the characters superficial. She even threw in more characters than anyone could want in a novel such as this. I quit about half way through. Just not for me."
3,A is for Acceptable,I agree that Grafton needs to get credit for starting off this genre way back in the early 80's. But the fact is that NOW the book is not all that great considering the competition.
3,Average,Quick mindless pulp read that just gives you something to do. The writing is average with occasionally too much attention to detail. There is an end twist to the plot but you could see some of the finale coming from a mile away. I will probably read some more of this series as I found Kinsey likeable enough but I will not plunge straight ahead and devour all of them.
3,cover page,the cover picture sucks!!!!!! what happened to them? they used to be sooooooooo good . i mean isnt star supposed to be a chestnut? And isnt Chris supposed to hav strawberry blond hair? i am so dissappionted with them. i grew up reading this series and i agree with everone else when they say its going downhill. these books used to hook me in and i wouldnt get up now i feel bored.
4,Its a good Book,Its a good book. I like it how jinks win his race and that Chris is riding for Townsend Acers. It would be differnt if Chris had a child at the age of 19 and she gets married at the age of 18. It also would be good if Star and Image got bread. They could call it Perfect Star or Wonder's Image. I would of rather Star been Caled Wonder's Last Star insted of Wonder's Star.I really like Jinx hes really cool. I'm kind of glad that Mel and Jazz arnt dateing any more i hope Mel and Kevin get back together.Thanks for reading this Letter thing.From Me
2,Help!,The TB series has been going downhill since book 12. The next book Bridle Dreams is about Samantha! What's going on with my fav. series. All I want to say is: Joanna buy your series back or I'm going to sue the new writer and write the books myself!!P.S. Joanna you better write a Super Super Special to straighten things out! HELP!
2,This album would get 5 stars but ....,"This album was origanally out in the 1980s as ""20 golden hit's"" by Kenny Rogers and The 1st Edition, now it's just ""golden hit's"" with half the songs missing. Shame."
3,Hawkwind - 'Space Is Deep' (Receiver Records Ltd.),"Several years back when I thought I had just about EVERY Hawkwind disc there is to be had,I found out about this title.Before I landed down a copy of my own,I was never able to find any info about the CD.Turns out 'Space Is Deep' is more or less ANOTHER seemingly countless compilation of assorted live tracks and extra mixes of the band's material.Most of the tunes appear to have MAYBE been mastered off of a vinyl lp.The first two cuts ""Spirit Of The Age"" and ""Urban Guerilla"" are a live snippet from a,I'll assume some late '70's gig with Bob Calvert(R.I.P)on vocals.The rest are either semi-rough demos or live recordings from OTHER gigs.""Angels Of Death"" and ""You Shouldn't Do That"" get cut off at the final two minute mark,which is sort of a bummer.For Hawkwind completists ONLY."
2,More of the same,"Outside of Place Vendome and Liasons, I don't know why someone would purchase this set. It has none of her most impressive work other than Place Vendome. It would have been much nicer to find the 40th Anniversary edition of Belle de Jour, Tristana, Les Voleurs, or Belle Maman. This is more of the same, and those of us that own countless Deneuve films want new remastered releases and films that have never before been on DVD. The Screen Icons collection at Amazon UK, which is released by Optimum is a much better collection. I myself own it, and it has one film that most Deneuve fans have probably never seen, Manon 70."
5,FINALLY FOUND IT,I HAD THIS MOVIE A FEW YEARS AGO AND LOANED IT TO SOMEONE AND NEVER GOT IT BACK. SOOOOO GLAD IT WAS IN STOCK.
4,"Great fight scenes, very little noticeable wire-fu...","Most of us watch action movies to see action. This one delivers in spades. The reality and cruelty of the training is a refreshing change from most candied US offerings. The fight scenes were choreographed expertly and rival Matrix special effects. Maggie Q has such charisma that she draws you into the movie and you can't stop watching it. There's a scene where she's dancing for her victim and she takes off her underwear. Then she tries to kill the guy but he knows in advance and gets the jump on her. The fight that ensues has her twirling and jumping all over the place yet her slip never goes high enough to reveal the goods. Is it CGI or just masterful camera angles? I don't know, but it makes for some teasing fun. If you have doubts rent it first and see for yourself. I enjoyed it though."
4,Hot Asian chick action flick,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a decent B-movieaction flick packed with some hot Asian women. It has a fairly good story lineand the acting is pretty good for the most part. Maggie Q is such a beautifulwoman and is very believable in her many fight scenes. I do not think this filmwill win any awards but it is well worth the VOD rental price.
5,This is why Maggie Q is Nikita.,"Director Wong Jing did a great job with this movie. It's a Hong Kong version of La Femme Nikita and it's raunchy but so pretty. The Hong Kong style of beauty is sparse features and beautiful long limbs. It's a really entertaining movie, much better than the Hong Kong pretty boy contributions to this genre."
3,They're more than just naked!,"Actually, this was a better movie than I thought it would be.If you love beautiful and deadly women, mixed with some martial arts and weaponry...then this one's for you!It at least kept my interest...on a few levels."
1,Really Bad movie,"This is one of the worst movie I have seen lately. The only good thing about this movie is some of the fighting sequences. The lead actress (Maggie Q) is beautiful, but she and the rest of the cast can't certainly not help the bad movie script from the director. The story doesn't make any sense. Everything is so illogic. My friends and I had a good laugh at this movie but seriously, it's really a bad movie overall.If you are looking for a great Hong Kong/China/Asian movie, I will recommend these instead: ""The Twin Effect (Vampire Effect)"", ""So Close"", ""Shaolin Soccer"", ""Hero"" and ""Infernal Affairs""."
2,Hilarious!!,"I don't know if this movie was intended to be funny but it was. The lines are so corny and the acting was truly weakSPOILERS- (if u can consider them that, becuz the movie is very predictable)What was up with the cop trying to hit on Maggie Q while her mom was dying?! He had time to pull out his business card and everything! and why was he walking when he had a car?!and Jewel Lee???!!! how did she die from some glass??? I thought she was the crazy one that could take pain?!If you thought So Close was fake .. don't watch this one. it'll have u rolling!!"
4,For the Serious Fan it's pretty good,I enjoy this disc. It's demos and alternative versions of some good Sweet tracks.The home demo of Fox on The Run shows that these guys had the talent.Not one of these tracks was a bummer.I really like the early version of Action; the insight I now have to this song gives me a laugh in a good way.The liner notes are brief and I don't know who wrote them but there is a line or 2 about each song.This is for the serious fan. Don't make this you're first Sweet CD because you'll just not understand.Long time fans---Buy this now!
1,Good only for Math and Verbal,"It's good for studying for the math and verbal sections but the individual tests such as mechanical comprehension, electronics and general science is very poor. For example, mechanical comprehension is straight up physics with many equations but the book does not go into this at all. There is also one other thing. THERE ARE MANY MISPRINTS AND MISTAKES. I can't even say how many mistakes there were. It's like this was never even reviewed thoroughly before being put into print."
5,Hard House Legend In Da Making,"I Love this cd, the beats are unbelievable..but still dj venom is still a work in progress, this cd is a big step from his past albums. ROCK ON DJ VENOM!! IF you like this cd, check out George Centeno & Darren R! HOLLA AT YA BOI!"
4,It's All In This Small Box,"The RP100 combines the versatility of a room full of vintage and modern amps with full-featured, studio-quality effects. With 26 programmable effects to choose from and up to twelve available at once, the RP100 offers endless possibilities.Each effect includes up to three adjustable parameters. The built-in Rhythm Trainer plays sampled drum beats in an infinite loop and allows you to change patterns, tempo, and volume level. The RP100 comes with forty ready-to-use factory presets, all of which can be adjusted and stored as user presets.Other features include 24-bit A/D-D/A, a simple user interface, chromatic tuner, stereo output, and an expression pedal input.* 6 programmable effects* Twelve effects available at once Three adjustable parameters pereffect Rhythm Trainer* Forty factory presets* Chromatic tuner"
2,Navigation sinks the ship!,"I love the sounds, effects and amplifier envelopes offered by this device. And it didn't take me too long to start figuring how to go up and down the menu. But I noticed as soon as I stood up, I couldn't read the type in the columns. It was just too small to easily navigate. Plugged in, on stage this just wouldn't do. I'd vote for a major revision to the display. Make it HUGE!"
4,Not a bad cart at all,The cart is not as big or durable as the ones you mught find at practice or at the Y but for the hosue it is nice. It has held up nice so far and we use it outdoors. We have 13 volleyballs in it and it could still could a bunch more.
3,Day hike book review,"On this handy book for day hikes around Phoenix, AZ; it's ok for some hiking but some trails was not on the book such as Black Canyon Trail which is well within day hike range from Phoenix(only 40 miles of freeway away from downtown Phoenix, the Badger Canyon trail was not on book, either.Overall , I would say that this hiking book is barely ok, it's just better than nothing.Isaac"
2,Are Americans colour blind?,The belt was of good quality and value for money. However the colour was distincly brown and not olive green as specified. I ordered one belt and received a brown one and although it was the wrong colour I decided to keep it. After checking with the Company that they in fact had an olive green belt in stock I ordered another. When it arrived it was again brown. I have now purchased an olive green belt off another supplier and when it arrived I was pleased to see that it was olive green. The moral of this tale is to ask your supplier if they are colour blind before ordering goods.
4,Respect for Mother Nature,"Panic Rising is aptly named. I felt the sensation reading these fast-paced stories even though I was in a warm and comfy armchair with a hot cup of tea at hand.I liked the idea that these adventures involved ordinary people, rescued and rescuers, who showed courage and fortitude to save lives. I connected especially with the stories set in my own backyard, like Heliotrope Ridge that I've ventured out on. It is so easy to imagine spontaneously sliding down an inviting snowy hill into an unseen crevace. Yikes!I was struck by the inspiring synchronicity in some of the rescues.I bought this book for my son who loves to hike in the woods and mountains. To be on the safe side maybe it should be accompanied by a personal locator beacon device."
3,get what you pay for,"This was bought for someone else....I can't see this case lasting too long. The quality looks very questionable and cheap. The picture made the case looke a lot better than what it does in person. The thing on the left side sticks out really far and the silver is very cheap looking. Unfortunately there aren't many cases for these types of ipods any more, so it's limited to these sorts of cases. It's held up so far but from the looks of it, I wouldn't give it more than a year."
4,Slightly misses the mark for a really good adventure,"Jules Verne did use comedy, but in describing his characters and their foibles. Here, the comedic touches can be a bit broad when they happen. The period film is also informed by a late 60's viewpoint. The most jarring thing for me is the music score, as the theme song and most of the incidental music is too modern for a film set in 1912. Well photographed in the Senegal, though.In addition to the topless bathing scene by Andress when they are on the run, there is also a topless group dance scene by the Senegalese early in the picture at Kramer's party to introduce the final form of the diamond after cutting."
3,Aggressive,"Apparently poised for a comeback, if you like a band that scrapes fingernails in 16/8 time, these are the guys. Art students only, please....."
4,A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE REAGAN YEARS.,"THIS BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT PRIMER FOR ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN EITHER A CURSORY OR DETAILED STUDY OF RONALD REAGAN AND HIS PRESIDENCY. MR. SOUZA DELINEATES IN GREAT DETAIL HOW REAGAN OVERCAME HIS CRITICS AT EVERY TURN AND IGNITED A CONSERVATIVE RENAISSANCE THAT STILL GOES ON TODAY. ANYONE, DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, LIBERAL OR CONSERVATIVE, WILL BE LEFT WITH THE DESIRE TO READ MORE ABOUT RONALD REAGAN AFTER READING THIS BOOK."
5,Why critics of Reagan are wrong,"Since the end of his presidency, all I have read in newspapers about Reagan have been thorough criticisms. Now I read in D'Souza's book why: Reagan ended the Cold War, and the American intelligentsia is angry about it!! The author's clear style shows what Reagan did, why he did it, and why he had so many critics from both the left and the right--and why Reagan's decisions were correct."
5,Dinesh's book helps you understand a great American leader,"Dinesh's book reviews the life of an Amercan. This extraordinary man with his american ideals, faith in his fellow citizen and his own human flaws became the leader of the free world. Dinesh explains from start to finish the rules that Reagan lived by and legislated for. Dinesh also explores Reagan's personal and professional lives, further helping us understand the man. After reading this book I think of Reagan in a new way. At a critical time in history when America desprately needed a leader and then found one in Reagan. The book explains how history will show that the world is a better place for having had his leadership. Americans who read this book will come away like me, missing the man who saw America as the, ""Shining city on the Hill""."
5,At Last! D'Souza Begins the Debate With this Great Tome.,"By starting off with his detractors arguments, Dinesh D'Souza sets the stage for the first truly intelligent discussion of Ronald Reagan's remarkable presidency. As various historians pick up this cue, the typical liberal approach to the eighties--demagoguery and irrational loathing--will soon be ""consigned to the ash-heap of history."" One thing is clear, by setting forth this intelligent, well-argued and meticulously documented volume, D'Souza has demonstrated that the truly open-minded, intelligent observer of history can and must join the parade which trumpets the achievements of this century's greatest leader."
5,"Get it, read it, love it!","Dinesh D'Souza set out to write the true story of America's fortieth president: why he confounded his critics, why he confounded the learned on both the right and the left, and why he (yes he) won the cold war, saved the economy, and made Americans proud again. This biography spends a little time in Reagan's childhood with an alcoholic father, his radio and Hollywood days, his travels for GE, and finally, his governorship of the nation's largest state, California, defeating the""popular"" Pat Brown (Jerry Brown's father). Then D'Souza shows how the Reagan presidency transcended the nay-sayers to be the most successful President since, well probably Lincoln. A great, uplifting book that will make the Reagan-haters squirm but will make those of us who love the man know even more why we do love him so. This book is well-written, entertaining and informative. Get it, read it, love it."
2,Almost didn't want to finish this book,"I am an avid reader, but I barely wanted to even finish this book. I was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, and I don't think this book gives him enough credit. I don't like the writer's style: his logic is difficult to follow sometimes, and he goes off on tangents instead of focusing on Reagan. He describes Reagan as a President that no one liked; this is NOT true!!Furthermore, I don't care for some of his (the author's) biased viewpoints that he threw in, like about the Vietnam War; they have no place in a book that is discussing the Life of Reagan."
1,"Tastes Great, Less Filling","This book is a classic example of hagiography. There's a lot of unadulterated praise here. A lot of it! But, there's very little real substance. I want to read about Ronald Reagan's life, not sing his praises from the highest mountaintop. Dinesh D'Souza would do well to learn the historian's art of objectivity. It's what's most obviously lacking in this tome."
2,So so,"I voted for Reagan twice. I thought he was a fine President. But this biography is such a kiss-up piece of work, and so naive it's almost silly. It's without any objectivity."
1,Pure Fiction,"In 349 B.C., the ancient Athenian orator Demosthenes wrote: ""Nothing is so easy as to deceive one's self; for what we wish, we readily believe.""How accurately descriptive of D'Souza's hagiography and the legions of Reagan fans who hold it up as the ""definitive"" Reagan biography. D'Souza's book merely perpetuates the myth that Reagan was a great man and some sort of knowledgable statesman, and the Reagan fans who wish it were so eat it up like pablum.In truth, Reagan had been a shill for corporate America ever since his B movie career collapsed in the early 1950s. His entire political philosophy was based upon variations of the same stock speeches that were written for him during his days as a spokesman for GE in the mid '50s. Rather than a life of ""extraordinary leadership,"" Reagan was a skilled practitioner of political mountebankery.Hardly something or someone to look up at with unadulterated admiration. People who find this book and its thesis credible simply prove Demosthenes right."
1,Ironic,"How Ironic that this author write a book about Reagan and slams Obama in 3 trashy books, Now you tell me are those books tells a true tale or this author has found a market to sell hate and lies."
5,God blessed America with this great man.,"'Nuff said.Ron, if you're reading this, thank you and god bless you. Your leadership was the stuff of legends. I can't wait to tell my grandchildren about the good you did our country."
1,Total Hate for a great President,If you Hate Ronald Reagan you will love this book. If you live in the real world and know how much our country improved under his presidency you will find this book distastful. My wife purchased this book to read about Reagon because she is from another country and wanted to learn about American History.I would rate this book as total crap.
1,DINESH IS A NEO CONSERVATIVE,"READERS! BEWARE! KNOW WHO YOU ARE READING! If you are not well-aware of political gamesmanship, you might be seduced by DeSouza. He can write. What you don't know is that he is a WELL-FUNDED NEO-CONSERVATIVE via Dartmouth College. This book on Reagan is just one more outlet for the carefully crafted mechinations of the superrich. Of course they love Reagan and his trickle down economics. It was a ploy to further enrich them! The book is laden with AGENDA because DeSouza has been bought several times over. You will definitely find he has ties to Dartmouth, William F. Buckley, and various superconservative foundations that wine and dine young intellectuals, then use them dress up their inhumane ideas in attractive colors.He's essentially an intellectual terrorist."
1,Not a Biography So Much as a Public Relations Move,"One day a biography of Ronald Reagan will appear that actually takes Reagan as its object for scholarly purposes. In other words, the work will examine Reagan's place in the political history of post-war America, since few of us care about his days as an actor. D'Souza's book, however, is not scholarly, but rather is the purely ideological product of a rightwing think tank publicist. Reagan would make a fascinating study for a scholar, since he was so patently second-rate that many of us have absolutely no idea how anyone could take him seriously. The scholar's job, though, is not to write hagiography or demonology, but to write something that will enlighten all of us on a subject. D'Souza's book is brown-nosing propoganda and nothing else. I await a biography of Reagan that will explain to me the devotion he has inspired. I still don't get it."
1,Two Bigots Together how wonderful?,"well first of all Dinesh D'Souza is a straight up Bigot.i bet his next book will be on Gulliani? Ronald Reagan was a Joke as President.Jessie Ventura is Governer maybe he will be President as well? there was nothing great about Reagan.his civil rights record took everybody back 50 years.he was Overrated.Tip O'neil called him the Dumbest President ever.Right On! Tip.how can you look up to a Man that had Oliver North Lie on TV? Him,North,Bush,&Clinton should have been Cellys with Nixon instead of treated as Heroes.only a fool would Acknowledge this Man as a Heroe."
1,poor quality,"i have a Pitbull and it didnt last even a day with him....take it from here...:( Its 18inch but looked like 10 inch i guess its ok, for a very little dog, but if you have a big dog, dont een bother, you will waste your money!"
5,A stand-up must,"I am going to do stand-up, and this book showed me what and what not to do. It also brought to light many of the fears and problems that even the most successful comics face. They were the same problems that I have been concerned about, and I thought were faqmiliar only to me, and I now realize that just because I have these fears does not disqualify me from doing or wanting to do stand-up, but it shows me just how much I have in common with the successful comedians."
5,a must have book to any comedian,"exactly what i wanted..tells you in a few wards what youve been searching for years.wow!!i read it and my hand r shaking' and not beacouse of the cold, ceacouse its look like the auther is talking to me."
4,One to curl up in bed with....,"This is a lovely book that mines the lives and minds some very impressive American comedians including Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock (my favourites). I think the title `insights' is right, because the practical section is very short. There are seven pages on `first steps in comedy', eight pages on `writing material' and excitingly seven pages on `doing television talk shows'.I think this is a book for comics to curl up in bed with and dream that their heroes are on conversation with them, egging them on and giving them tips about stand-up."
4,More Interviews then Advice,"Not what I expected, but very helpful.I was looking for a book to talk about comedy and writting comedy. This book touches on it but has way more interviews with famous comics.Just keep in mind there is not a lot straight advice, but more advice in the form of interviews from comics."
5,Priceless,"Simply put, the information Mr. Ajaye provides in this book is priceless to aspiring comedian (like myself). It provides a solid foundation, to build upon. He gives you the real life of a stand up comedian, from many different viewpoints. You get straight up, in your face information, that answers many of the questions you may have, and then some. I'm just glad that I chose this book, before taking that step to the stage, because now I have a roadmap, and an idea of what to expect along the way. I appreciate that Mr. Ajaye was real with this, and lets you know that, yes.. you will most likely bomb the first time out. That small bit right there, removed a bit the anguish, I had, from not knowing what to expect. EXCELLENT BOOK!!!!! Thank you Mr. Ajaye."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"Of all the comedy books I own, this has truly been not only the most helpful for a comedian, but also the most entertaining because of the comedians interviewd. Franklyn Ajaye asked all the questions anyone would want to know who's considering a career in stand-up comedy and also tells you the major elements that make a good comedian. Even if your just a fan of comedy, you get to hear from the best, their stories and what it took to make them great. I loved it and have read it 3 times."
5,FRANKLYN AJAYE IS THE TRUE MASTER OF COMEDY!,"I have been a working comedian since 1988. I am currently co-hosting the number one radio morning show in Washington D.C.. My life is better than good. BUT, after reading Franklyn's book, I was RE-Inspired! The Art of Stand-Up Comedy speaks to the inner soul of anyone with the love of comedy in their heart. It forces you to reexamine your own dedication and work ethic. Franklyn Ajaye as a comedian is my personal inspiration and it is his brilliance that oversees the power of this great book. It is his genius that is respected by the greats who are interviewed, thus yielding the most from them. He doesn't know it, but Franklyn Ajaye is my Mr. Miyagi of comedy. And he will be yours too if you read this (and listen to his ""I'm A Comedian Seriously"" album!)."
4,"Great CD, but not the bonus","The ""Best Of"" CD is great. It has good versions of many excellent Jonathan Richman songs. But I was really disappointed by the bonus CD. I was really surprised to see a CD full of JR songs I didn't know, and the explanation came to me when I put it in my CD player: it's a CD full of songs by other artists on the Beserkly label. A few serviceable pop songs on there, but I won't be listening to that disc again. Which makes the main disc very pricey for a used CD. I wish I'd boughtRoadrunner: Beserkley Collectioninstead."
2,Kindle Edition is rife with typos.,"Not reviewing the story, so much as the delivery method. The Kindle edition is clearly a transcribed scan that nobody has bothered to proofread. There are actually hundreds of typos and spelling errors, which detracts from at least my enjoyment of an otherwise very good book. I love my kindle, but at least for this book, I'd go for the paper copy."
1,"BORING, D SERIES HAMILTON","DON'T HATE IT, BUT QUIT HALFWAY. GOT MYSELF OTHER OF HIS STUFFANDIT'S VERY GOOD...FORGET GREGMANDEL AND CONCENTRATE ON THE TRILOGIES."
4,Never fails to please,"Mr. Hamilton may be the best thing to happen to the science fiction genre in a while. His most recent novels are breathing a breath of fresh air into a market of sad worn out tales and books written by formula. This, one of his early works lacks some of the finess we now expect but all the same is very enjoyable."
3,So-So,"This book started out strongly, but ended weakly. The vision of the future is interesting, typically dark. The characters are unbelieveable at times. One woman, for all practical purposes was a former Amish woman later becomes extremely sophisticated in the ways of the world. This seems highly unlikely. Overall a average read. I don't think I'll read any more in the series. Mostly a detective series in the far future."
3,"Great Content, poor editorial performance","Great book, great authur....But the worst editing i have ever seen!!! soo many typooooossssss!!!!Shame on whoever edited this digital edition!!!!"
1,I couldn't finish it,"Feeble characterisation, lots of clichés and above all a doubtful extreme right wing ideology."
1,Knockoff - Not the bulb pictured,I just received this bulb that I ordered via Amazon. It is not an authentic Aqua bulb. I installed and it seems to be working but who knows if it will last as long as an authentic Aqua bulb or have the same effectiveness. I'm very disappointed in the vendor for featuring a photo of a product the looks authentic and then shipping an item that is a knockoff.
3,TMNT,"For those who are Ninja Turtle geeks, this is a must have for your collection. Keep in mind that this era of TMNT is much different and was geared for a much younger audience in it's day than the newer TMNT of 2003. This means that the original TMNT is a little more like slapstick in comparison with the new gen of TMNT, which follows more of a storyline like the comic book which bears it's name."
3,More Bad,"Like with the first volume this disk also has some horrible episodes on it. At least you get 7 episodes this time around, which still isn't enough in my opinion. We were paying 10 bucks for 13 back when they first started these sets. It's more of the European Vacation episodes and like with the first volume they are unwatchably bad. On top of the stories being just plain bad the voice acting takes a huge hit with Raph being a sub the entire time and Shredder's voice jumping everywhere. Don switches a lot as well.Again if your hardcore for turtles get it otherwise don't. This will not remind you of the good times turtles was as a kid, it will rip the nostalgia goggles right off your eyes."
3,4 years waiting for...,"I'm really disappointed..lagwagon have lost all the originality they once had. It seems that Joey Cape put all of his ideas in his side(?) project Bad Astronaut..well this album is ok, but nothing more, everything is just heard, there is a song that in the instrumental ending reminds me to Nofx's The Decline but Nofx do that really much better.Hey there, wait another month and use your money for the new NOFX album...believe me"
4,Lagwagon Blazes Through After Long Absence!,Lets keep this short and straight to the point. Fans of the past 3 albums of Lagwagon should buy this. People who like Bad Astronaut should buy this.If you didn't you should still check out a few tracks online or have a free preview listen at your favourite record store. It's great that bands like Lagwagon still strive to keep punkrock highly energetic ... keep it up Lagwagon! Perhaps Fat Wreck should release Chris Shiflett's solo album which Joey Cape has a copy of it seems...
1,The good times can't last forever,"This is when Lagwagon really started to get generic. I think Joey just ran out of ideas. And most other Fat Wreck bands also sound generic now, buy ANYTHING from Lagwagon before this, and it will sound worlds better. And don't buy resolve either, it sucks. I'm so sad that Lagwagon had to take this path in their musical career. Hopefully, Joey will at least try to write a good song soon. And I also hate the production because it sounds so polished that it hurts my ears. DON'T BUY BLAZE!!!!"
5,"Hook, Line, and Sinker","Keith Douglas writes a another book that has the right amount of suspence, action, and adventure. I read this book constantly until there was no more. I hope Keith Douglass writes another book in the series I just can't wait!"
2,Earlier books are much better,"The earlier books in the series are much better. Blake Murdock has turned into some kind of Uber-naval warrior, an expert on things far out side of his realm of professional study. Beyond this the book lacks intensity and focus of the earlier books. ST7 fights an entire war in about 150 pages, compared to the 3 or 4 fire fights that take place in the other books. The pace feels rushed, and the writing appears to have suffered because of it"
4,Chicago Indie Rock Supergroup Lives Up To The Name,"One problem with this five song EP is that it's not a full length CD. The songwriting is superb and the performances are skillful and spirited.Another problem may be that it only hints at the power of Chestnut Station's live show, which recently stole the show opening for Tenacious D at the House of Blues in Chicago.Chestnut Station's line-up includes vocalist Rian Murphy (ex-Royal Trux, Smog, Dolomite, and Mantis, as well as producer for Edith Frost), guitarist Rick Rizzo (Eleventh Dream Day), bassist Paul Caporino (M.O.T.O.), drummer Brendan Murphy (ex-Wesley Willis Fiasco, Jesus Lizard), keyboardist Mark Greenberg (ex-Coctails) and guitarist John Whitney (ex-Dolomite)."
5,Best book,This happens to be the best book I have found for learning and diagnosis of heart rthythms that I have ever found. It is a very clear book on the expected intervals and complexes and helps the nurse to diagnosis when they see something irregular.
1,Book came late and torn; repacked by us postal,"The product came in very poor condition with front cover torn in the middle and was repacked by the us postal service. Book condition inside was poor (pages wrinkled/bent/dog-eared/dirty) NOT ""like-new"" as falsely listed on AMAZON. Order was placed 01/12/2010. Book did not came until 2/08/2010, almost 4 weeks later!!! Very disappointed and will not be ordering from this seller or AMAZON again. I have ordered from other book sites and never had this happened when book came damaged and torn like this!"
1,A total rip-off,"Ms. Sullivan should be ashamed for foisting off such a piece of outdated and hackneyed material at any price. This home made computer-file CD (warning- it can't be played on standard CD players- but you wouldn't want to) has such timely advice as ""Don't send out demonstration videotapes by mail without a request. It is too expensive.""Hello? Can you spell ""Internet?"" ""Email?"" ""Digital?"" None of these terms are heard anywhere in the program. The liner notes give a code for entry into the author's website for (I quote) ""Specific Action items, references and other goodies... available only to you."" I hoped that the CD was just a license for the real substance. Wrong. The password leads to a one page text outline of equally mundane material.Put a match to two twenty dollar bills. It would be a far better use of your money."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought Vickie K. Sullivan's audio CD, ""Get Those Bookings: Marketing Strategies for Professional Speakers,"" and was really disappointed. I couldn't get it to play in my car (which is where I like to listen to audio CD's), and her voice is not pleasant to listen to. Also, I just didn't find the content of her CD to be all that useful.I guess I should have known that Ms. Sullivan couldn't pass on real trade secrets in a mere hour. It seems to me that she just wants to sell her consulting services. Or maybe the ""Marketing Strategies"" in this CD are just out of date, more suited to the twentieth century.Either way, I bought a promise that just doesn't deliver."
2,Not Very Suspenseful,"This glacially-paced ""suspense"" drama set in Atlanta was anything but suspenseful. While waiting for the plot to advance, it was fun to listen to Linda Purl lose her Southern accent when she got agitated. Also fun to see the sexy James Read do something other than sidekicks. But it was clear who the killer was from the first time we met him, and the ending of the movie is a grand disappointment! Not even any lovely shots of Atlanta. Two stars (both for Read) is generous."
5,"OH, THIS CD IS GREAT!!!! You can listen to it over and over","I love music, but DANG! The music is GREAT, the Voice! What a voice. I have played Blue Horizon like 100 times, and I never get tired of it. Not many song can do that, but her voice, and the music makes this CD one of best. Pick it up, everyone that I have told to buy this CD, has been VERY Happy with it! Maysa is all that, to me this is one of her best cd's. It will make want to get every CD she is on, including Incognitos stuff!"
4,The Incognito sound with more R&B flava...and the VOICE!,"Maysa has done it for us again with a nice blend of jazz, funk, soul and R&B. Her voice sounds better than ever on these cuts, if you can believe that!All the songs are gems, but her take on ""Keep Your Head To The Sky"" is just like buttah. This is one of those songs that you thought would NEVER be able to be effectively remade, but Maysa pulls it off to great effect.""Out Of The Blue"" is one of those rare CD's that's perfect for either a summer drive or a rainy day. Put it on and enjoy."
3,not Maysa at her best,"I expected a lot more from Maysa and she did not live up to my expectations. If you know Maysa from Incognito, this CD maybe a let down."
4,Great service.,"Great service over all. The shippers asking cost was a bit pricey regarding ""Out of the Blue"" great CD thanks!"
5,Out of the Blue by Maysa,"First of all, the cd is great and as always, of great quality. I am always satisfied with the product that I order through Amazon.com."
5,What an album!,"Of all the albums I've listened to this year, ""Out of the Blue"" has to be one of the best I've heard! Maysa exhibits a very strong yet soothing voice throughout this album. All great songs, especially ""Mr. So Damn Fine"", ""Blue Horizon"", and ""Everything"". If you're in need of some chill-out music, this is definitely worth the listen."
3,Pretty good CD,I'm not going to get all into it about this CD. It has some good songs on it but It isn't one of her best. But you definitely won't be upset when you buy it either.
3,quirky hippy wierdness,"Principal Edwards were a wierd enough experience back in the late 1960's...to find them alive and well on CD is stranger still. This was music which really had to be experienced live; I have the vinyl albums but haven't played them for years. Fascinating period pieces, highly pretentious lyrics, some ace guitar and a general aura of quasi-intellctual hippy student wierdness...its all good fun but check out the Incredible String Band for a deeper insight into psychedelic folk - rock of the late Sixties."
1,wrong size,"I received the board with the same part number. Unfortunately, it measures 13""x7.5"", well off from the claimed size of ""16.8 x 9.2 x 1 inches""."
3,Book: The Adventists,"Purchased as a gift, upon request, for a friend. I did not read it, but I understand recipient found enjoyment reading."
1,"Remember, this is the church where David Koresh originated from.","Don't be swayed people. I was an SDA for 35 years. The doctrine of the church goes against the Gospel of Jesus Christ in so many ways, it's not even funny. Rather than buy this movie, might I suggest that you buy one or all of these books to find out the history & doctrines of the SDA church.It's Ok Not to be a Seventh-Day AdventistSeventh Day Adventism RenouncedLife Of Ellen WhiteWhite LieThe case of D. M. Canright;: Seventh-day Adventist charges examined,God bless you all."
5,Interesting Documentary,Martin Doblmeier did a great job with this documentary. He covers a brief history of the Adventist Church and ties this to a healthy lifestyle as taught and practiced by the church members. He highlights the present cutting edge medical work and facilities that are working to help people reach a healthy life. There is more to the Adventist church than a healthy lifestyle but this film does a nice job covering that area. I was given a copy of this dvd to review but had already seen it and was planning on getting my own copy anyway.
3,"Not terrible, not great","I have a made in England set that was incomplete from 15 years ago to compare this Amazon purchase. My Amazon 47 piece set in blue is all made in Columbia. Quality is not nearly as good as made in England. English origin pieces are so much more clear, not blurry like the Columbian ones. Finish on the pieces can be rough or sharp pieces of something stuck in the glazing. I guess for the price I can't complain and they are good enough for everyday, but I wouldn't use them for company."
2,Churchhill China (47 piece Set),Not what I though I was ordering. This product was manufactured in Colombia rather than England. Several pieces were broken. Amazon completely and quickly took care of my order and the problems that I was having.
5,Exquisite China Set,"What an exquisite, beautiful, old-worldm elegant China set this is! Perfect for every day or formal occasions, holiday special dinners, etc. The English countryside scenes are lovely & reminiscent of my grandmother's china sets. My sons love it! A superb buy!"
5,What church should sound like,"I'm not very good at reviewing music, but this album is remarkable. The album's production is unintrusive, so the listener feels as if the music is playing in the next room. I've heard people call Palace country, and bluegrass, and folk and several other genres, but it doesn't matter which one you subscribe to, this album will become a favorite. The music seems familiar, the songs are at the tip of your tongue. Whether you have heard Palace before, or the name is unfamiliar, once you've heard ""Viva Last Blues"", it will be part of your music collection forever."
2,Too much respect,"2 1/2Oldham supplements his usual lazy, sleepy presence with a lazy, sleepy tiny band, and whatever helps take some of the sting off of his showy-humble demeanor is a good thing, since a few of these songs actually groove, and many of them distract."
2,Let down,RITM was always one of my favorite acts especially live - the dvd is worth picking this up but the cd is a let down - I mean why doesnt this have the 12 minute version of deeper which is the ultimate RITM track? The chopped up 5 minute version doesnt do this song justice. Other tracks are cut short as well. After waiting this long its a big let down :(
2,Disappionting Effort from one of my Most Anticipated Albums!!,"I have been eagerly awaiting this release from RITM for well over 5 years, and I have been greatly let down. The name of the album is appropriate because the material seems dated, as if it was made over a Decade ago. In the nineties this probably would have been a great album. Of course, there are several great tracks but the old. Overall the album lacks creativety and versatility. However, I did give the album two stars for the addition of the DVD, which is well worth the purchase...too bad there live performances do not translate to CD. If you're new to RITM, I would recommend this CD, but if you are like me and seen the live and know the material get it for the DVD."
2,disappointed,"this review concerns the dvd. i bought this for the dvd hoping that i would get a live RITM performance. unfortunately, there are only a few songs performed live. the rest are more like music videos shot inside a dark room with some lights. these videos are not performed live but instead just go along with the studio mix of the song. bleh. most everything that is so great about RITM is the experience of seeing them live with thousands of screaming fans. the few tracks that are actually done this way, are outstanding. i would love to know why their entire performance was not captured. check out the ULTRA music fest 2004 dvd and get most of the live material that is on this RITM release, and in addition you will get many other performance from the top djs in the scene."
5,An incredible thrash album!!!,"In my opinion, this is the best Deceased album, along with ""The blueprint for Madness"". King Fowley and comp. makes a great album with agressive guitar riffs, tight drum parts and amazing vocals. A true thrash album that deserves more than 10 stars!!!"
5,"Ecstatic, Period.","Well, I don't think all of the songs on this CD are great. But you SHOULD have this amazing CD for the last track, Canti e Suoni. I have a huge collection of progressive rocks but there are only a couple of songs I think 'Ecstatic'. One is 'the onlything she needs' by UK (79 Danger money), and 'Canti e Suoni'. Generally I don't buy a CD only for a song or two but this was a true exception. I hardly bother with the other songs on this CD. Canti e Suoni is what I want from this CD. And beautiful album jacket is a bonus. Strongly recommened! ---------Young"
4,"Awesome full-length debut... go get your ""gift"" right now!!!","LOVELESS is a Boston-based quartet led by Dave Wanamaker (formerly of the group Expanding Man) and featuring Jennifer ""Jen"" Trynin (who had two solo CDs in the 90s and some success with her single, ""Better Than Nothing""). I've been a Jen fan for a long time and was pleased to find her performing in this new band. They released a solid debut EP a year or so ago, and this is their first full-length CD. Four of the five tracks from the EP are here, and the six new tracks are phenomenal as well. Slight differences from the EP are the fadeout of ""Go"" (an abrupt powered-off ending as opposed to the gradual fade of the original... nothing wrong with that, though!), and ""Beautiful"" was originally named ""Tonight"" (same song, just retitled). You can't beat the opening one-two punch of ""Go"" and ""Gift to the World""... this is pure power rock 'n roll as it should be. Not a weak track in the bunch... fantastic listening from start to finish."
4,Great modern rock,"As the other reviews have said, this is just some great rock music. While I suppose you have to classify this as indie music, I don't see why it wouldn't be very successful on FM radio. Anyway, I hope another album is on the way."
4,Great price for cute costume,"I got the costume quickly. It was a fun costume, I actually wore it to run a 10k!"
2,"Not quite a reference book, not quite an instruction book","I expected it to be a reference guide, but it really requires a lot of deduction to pull anything together. The book isn't clear on which version of the WSH it is using, doesn't provide usage code examples for all listed commands in both Java Script and VBScript, and either lightly touches upon, or completely skips major concepts. It reads pretty dry, and really should make the source code readily available right in the book, instead of having to navigate through Wrox's site to find it. Might be a good ""additional information"" type book once you buy and read a real instructional or reference book for the WSH."
3,Good book - if you already know some of Windows Scripting,This book is an excellent resource for someone who already knows quite a bit about Windows Scripting. If you are a beginner or trying to just get started this book is not for you.
3,It's Documentation...,"It's documentation, that's about all I can say. It's not too bad, but it seems like it is definitely aimed more towards the developers. Too many windows 98 examples and not enough real-world NT examples. But, due to NO previous documentation, it's not a bad start."
5,Spanish Bible,I am not Spanish but my friend seems to like this bible he asked me to help him get one. (not computer savy)
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"BJ Fairmont, have a succesful medical practice, two great friends and a whole town that loves her. Even with all this she feels something is missing in her life. She wants a baby! The solution, adopt a child! But sometimes life plays tricks on us and life after 40 is no different. The only man she had never gotten over reappears in her life and everything changes. Flynn Loves military life and even with the uncertainty of what future holds for him due to an injury he decides to help BJ with her goal. Dianne Castell has crafted a masterpiece with this book. She combines the love of family and friends, surrogate parents and steamy passionate love.This is a heartwarming,fun & sexy story that will keep you turning pages until the end and craving to read another of her books."
4,Who put grandma under the stairs?,"The night of the annual, Demented Hallowe'en bash. The crowd comprising a specially selected blend of psychotic Teds, Rubber clad sex-kittens, Cyberpunks and assorted members of Demented's seedy underground society. They had been assembling like a murder of crows since dusk. On the final stroke of midnight the band prise themselves away from the backstage bar and stumbled onto the stage. The twisted results have been captured in all their gut-wrenching glory so you too can be part of the 'Orgasmic Nightmare' that is DEMENTED ARE GO!"
3,lost,"Unfortunately, the book was lost in the mail, but they were quick on refunding my money and replying to my email. I would use them again"
5,Defines the genre of BLACK METAL,"Dissonance, growls, distortion, heavy drums, and Satan - the definition of BLACK METAL. This album was the apex of Venom's reign as THE Black Metal Gods. If you like this, then At War With Satan as well as Welcome To Hell are must-haves."
1,Satanic music,call this what you want black metal or death metal i call this garbage all there albums are satanic welcome to hell at war with satan Black Metal stay away from this band dont waste your money buy something better old Iron Maiden Judas Priest except ramit down this band is garbage upsidedown crosses huge pentagrams are garbage this album is for devil worshippers i give this 0 stars
2,Disappointing,"I am a Wishbone Ash fan, but this lackluster performance is downright boring. Sorry. Save your money."
2,Boring!!!!,"This book is really bad!!! Hans Holzer might have called himself the original ""ghost hunter"", but he is not a very good author. The book recounts the events leading up to the murder of the Defoe family, the subsequent arrest of the son, his confession, and then the trial and conviction. The title is truly misleading, because the book has nothing to do with possession. Just skip it!! There are so many other great reads about the murders in Amityville, so save your money and buy those!!! Happy Reading!!!"
2,Another No Vote for The Love Drug,"Was hoping this would be a good honest book about MDMA, instead we get results of studies with extremely small groups of people, questionable sources, and the usual drug hysteria. You'll do better with information found on the web, not to mention the writing will be more enjoyable."
2,Never played volleyball before?,"Now I realize that I have had more experience in volleyball then most people but this book was insulting to my intelligence. If you are a knowledgeable player turned coach then don't waste your money. Many of the notions are outdated and many of drills a five year old could invent. This book was written by great volleyball minds, but for some reason it falls short in all areas. If you are a new to this sport as a coach or player then this book is great for you. I gave it two stars because there was one clever drill in it that I will use."
5,Excellent!,"This is an excellent cutting board and worth every penny. It is just the right size for my needs and I can easily lift it with one hand. It is very beautiful so I keep it on the counter leaning up against the wall and it makes me smile every time I see it. The bambo is so hard that my good Wusthof knives don't scar it at all and I am able to wash it with hot water, soap, and a brush after each use so I know that it stays clean. I gave it a wipe down with mineral oil when I got it about 5 weeks ago and I dry it with a towel after washing. So far no warping or cracking."
5,Geat Tool When Space Is Limited,"I use this tool for grinding and cut off jobs on a 30 ft sail boat. It works extremely well in tight places and the ease of use is superior to any power tool I use on board the boat.Although all the hadware on board (nuts and bolts etc) are statnless steel, power has never been an issue.Highly recommend this tool."
3,I'm waiting for the movie...,"This is one of many African American ""slice of life"" family stories like ""Soul Food"" that I would love to see as a movie and I think others would too. Its a story of family love, challenges, and triumph. It is written from the heart of a daughter who shared a love with her mother and shares her legacy with others. It's an easy read for those that have little time to read for pleasure. Ideal for subway/bus commute to & from work, sitting and waiting to take the kids home after rehearsal/team practice, or at bedtime during that brief period before actually falling to sleep but not actually up for doing anything responsible or requiring too much effort. If you happened to grow up in New York with working class southern rooted parents and also grew up in the church with your family, you might find yourself ""waving your hand"" and ""saying Amen"" every now and then while reading this book--both my sister & I did :)"
5,"I am honored and blessed to have ""known"" Pig","I was totally overwhelmed by the life of Mrs. Angela Upshur! I have learned so much about myself and my relationship with God and my family by experiencing her life. I find myself thinking I wonder what Pig would do about this. I know her and love her. Shoot I can't wait to meet her when my mansion is ready! She has shown me that it's okay to give your life to God, not to worry if people think your strange or a brick short. I was so blown away by her daughters also, and Cut. What a wonderful family to grow up in- what a great mom and dad. I more than felt like I knew and know you all- I felt like this book was written for me. It feels like Pig has her hand in my life too, I dont think I will ever be the same."
1,Poor bootleg quality sound,"I absolutely love Bow Wow Wow but this album is a tremenodous dissappointment. It is a wonderful concert and performance but it is the sound that is a problem. It is very poor, sounds like a bad bootleg recording."
1,Too Boring,"No catchy songs, very amateur video. The letters just popped up on the screen through the entire video. Just a boring video. Child had no interest in watching at all."
5,Loved it so much I am buying another!,My son loved this movie when he was 18 months old... by his 2nd birthday he could recognize and say every capital letter of the alphabet. He watched it and played with it so much that it no longer works so I just ordered a new one for my 16 month old daughter.
2,An Aside,"I won't quibble with the criticisms of this DVD, but I would like to make a couple of observations. First, the retail price of $17.98 for the Miracle Pictures DVD is absurd. Their DVDs are typically sold in dollar stores and mostly feature battered public domain prints; I picked mine up in Kroger's baked goods aisle for a dollar. Second, the title cards are read by Jacqueline Lovell, a one-time ""adult"" movie actress (""I Cream on Jeannie""). I mean no disrespect at all, since she has moved on to minor roles in mainstream movies, but I am certainly curious about how she wound up reading in both this and ""The Patchwork Girl of OZ"" DVDs at the same time she was working in adult films under the name Sara St. James. For the record, her voice is extremely well-recorded and on good stereo system she seems to be in the room with you. I think she does a fine job in a rather superfluous assignment."
1,Too long to ship,"I purchased a music cd. A week later and it still had not shipped. As a customer, I expected it to be shipped sooner. I am not pleased with how long it is taking!!!"
2,~ buyer beware ~ Just for show item ~,"This is a "" only for looks "" item. It is not very warm. I put this as a decorative piece over my feather blanket. It does have some discoloration. It looks like it has sat in the sun for a while. The upc regular price is $99.99 not $150.00 as stated. It does come with flyaways that need to be trimmed. Do not pull them the material on top is nice loking but will tear or fray if pulled. I doubt this will make it out of the washer...Much less the dryer. Becareful with the bed skirt it is so thin it needs to be placed in place do not pull it or you will tear it in half. Also you will need to order the next size or bigger. The Californis King I ordered barely fits over the top of my full size bed. This is not children friendly. It is a nice to look at set but needs to be handled with care. The pillow shams are nice."
4,Well worth the money!!,I think this one is really not so bad...Its warm and heavy enough.. the looks..I am not a patchwork lover...so keep wondering when they will tear off in the patch rims... otherwise this comforter is a steal for the money...I actually paid the same price for this as a duvet cover(for my Duvet)..would have liked a more frilly bed skirt..the one they have provided is not half as bad... I liked the size too..just right!!!! I think anyone can buy this as comforter sets really are never this cheap and thanks to the free shipping its makes it all the more economical!!!!
5,Good for price,"I thought that the comforter would be cheap looking because of the price, but I am very pleased with the outcome. The fabric is nice and the quality is more than expected. The King fits my Kinf perfectly and the item came right on time. I would definitely order this product for family and friends."
5,Classy!,"It's been over a month now and my wife and I are extremely happy with our king comforter! Looks expensive, feels great, and warms enough that we had to remove an extra layer of blanket from the bed. My only complaint is I have to kick the cats off so I can go to bed at night. :)"
3,Hmmm.....,"Well, I've listened to this album a few times and I still am not getting the response that the lavish praises would have suggested. If you are looking for something different, make sure you listen to the CD first before you buy. I know I could have spent my money a little more wisely."
2,No what I expected,"The book is too general and it's not likely that a traveler will visit the who US. For the 4 states that I visited, the information was scarce. I regret of carrying all that weight. Should not include hotel info since it changes a lot and good deals are found better at other sources. Should include maps of most important cities like NYC, NYC metro, etc."
5,The Matchmaker,"This was a great story!! It was a wonderful read. The story just flows along, you do not realize how far into the story you are until you look up from the pages. It is a great story for anyone."
2,The usual rubbish,Forget it! If you really want to know about voodoo buy Vodou Shaman (Ross Heaven) or Mama Lola (Karen Brown). This book is largely fantasy.
2,Oldest Living Confederate Widow tells too much,"In Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All, Allan Gurganus' superb writing style and vivid vignettes makes it worth reading the first 250 pages or so. After that, however, the chapters become somewhat repetitive and seem neverending. His style is more suited for short stories, which he writes very well."
4,A good period piece,This book nicely outlines the drama of human interaction against a rich background of relationships and changing times. The friendship between 2 near-adolescent girls is well-explored and quite realistic. The emotions and disillusionment of a very young Civil War soldier are well-expressed and may be applicable to current times. Familial relationships and ties are explored. Its ending will surprise you.
2,Less than the Sum of its Parts,"Although enjoyable enough in parts, neither the writing nor the story are good enough to justify the book's considerable length. By the end I resented the time I could have spent reading other books. Many characters have no reason to exist - some don't even exist. Why does the protagonist repeatedly mention having had nine children, yet only ever refer directly to six (and name four)? Ultimately disappointing."
4,The Memories,"When I was a little girl my father would drive us up to Birmingham on Saturdays to visit my grandfather David, whose father John was in Nathan Bedford Forrest's baggage train. It was always amazing to hear the stories he would tell.And that's a lot like Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All; the memories, I mean, and the stories. This is an excellent book, especially for Daughters of the Confederacy or other organizations that look at the Civil War. I highly reccomend it."
3,Would make a great screenplay by Robert Altman,"Allan Gurganus' short story, ""He's at the Office"", in the 2000 Best American Short Stories Anthology encouraged me. I bought this and a novella called ""Plays Well With Others"", which after the opening I had to put down because of the complexity of the writing style, a lesser version of Gravity's Rainbow, that would require extensive reads. Confederate Widow was a joy from the start with a rich texture of characters. But like all rich things, you can only take so much of it. Three-quarters of the way through the book I realized neither Lucy or the Captain were going to offer any denounement, just a serial view of their lives together (and apart). He's an excellent writer, but I could not, at the time, endure another colorful characterization or another folksy aside by Lucy to the narrator. It is the kind of book that might do well as a screenplay in the vien of narrated history, such as Little Big Man. I might even go back and finish reading it one day."
5,i saw the miniseries on tv first,"ok, so i was flipping through the channels and my daughter started crying. as i rocked her to sleep,it wasnt the first time i have had to sit through some terrible thing cause i couldnt reach the remote and she was nodding off.I started to watch one of the parts of this miniseries...oh my god i watched a woman give birth and i thought oh, god that seemed real...she was terrified . that woman was lucy marsden. i searched for the rest of the mini series and even tried to see if any of the video stores near me had it to rent.then i turned to amazon, i bought the miniseries ...after watching it i was so in awe at how marriage at a young and innocent age was really portrayed , that i bought the book on amazon too...and it did'nt disappoint!i tell anyone who will listen about the movie and book! that was the best book i have read on a womans struggle with issues of marriage and childbearing since evergreen which i also highly reccomend."
1,unclear narrator,"I am reading this book for a book club, but can't stand it any longer. Some of the stories are interesting, but if the old lady is really narrating, they are told with unlikely detail. Hearsay stories don't sound like this. The narrator's voice doesn't come through these stories. I have finally decided not the waste any more time reading this rambling book."
1,Zzzzzzzz,"I bought this book in Bangkok and read it because it was in English. Otherwise I would have chucked it aside. Ditto to what other reviewers have said about the bogged-down prose style, plus several other serious flaws, including but not limited to:characters that are developed at ponderous length and suddenly disappear, never to be heard from again; the incomprehensible pattern of events which the narrator chooses (giving us every random detail for about a 12-year period and then skipping over a whole lot of stuff that would have been nice to know); stomach-churning prissiness that attempts to pass as womanspeak (""I then scolded my prettiest girl for lisping so""), and a burning-of-the-plantation scene that is laughably stupid as well as flat-out physiologically impossible. Not for the literate."
1,Just tell the story and get it over with!,Ordinarily I love a novel I can settle down and read - something really engaging. This book was more frustrating than engaging. The choppy sentences and haphazard storyline were too much to bear past the 6th chapter. For those of you who loved it - I admire your stamina. I just couldn't slog through another page and it's RARE that I don't finish a book.
5,Very interesting,"I enjoyed reading this book, but I speak only for the reading material and not the actual math problems. I learned quite a bit and the book goes through quite an extensive and thorough explanation in biographies and methods that were used in the different mathematical discoveries. Really easy to read and understand. If you're a math major or someone who is just interested in the history of mathematics, then I highly recommend."
3,Nice Briefcase,This briefcase was a gift for my mother nice bag but not as large as I thought it would be. Will still be able to use as a starter Briefcase.
3,"It's allright, kinda...","If your feeling a bit stressed and you can't seem to find the 'off' switch on your overdrive, then this is your remedy. Sweet an sour fluid streams of accoustic candy four the relaxation of your mind or just for daydreaming, this cd releases a bit of ordenary life tension and let's you swim away to an isle were nobody can boder you. But if you feel like releasing your frustation by kicking some phat beats, then don't buy this one."
3,"perfect, but pricey.","these bulbs were exactly what we needed, and fast. they were pricey, but overnight for $4 evened it out."
2,Is NOT made to take the JSH180 Jig Saw.,"This case is NOT able to take the JSH180 Jig saw. I contacted Bosch and there is no case designed for that product. Personally, I think the tool bags are crap and don't store or protect the tools very well. Undoubtedly I'll end up making a case to store this and other tools that Bosch doesn't have hard cases for. I like Bosch tools very much, but I am disappointed regarding the tool storage options."
2,Not for someone who already has a scottish terrier,"This is a good book for someone who is about to buy a dog of this breed, but not for someone who has one already. It provides important information to be considered in the long term."
5,Not for everyone,This is a great book on soups if you have some culinary knowledge. I've used a number of David's ideas for classical soups in my place. Its a great book for those who want to understand soup.
5,Great Stroller,"We recently purchased this stroller for our newborn son, but have turned it into a our daughters stroller. It works wonderful. She is over 3ft. tall and 40lbs, and still fits comfortably.It is a larger stroller. We have a Malibu Maxx and it does take up a lot of room, but is well worth it.We have taken it to Disneyland for the day, and also gone for walks on some the trails around our house."
5,CONVENIENCE,"It's a great combination with the carseat (new model goes up to 30lbs). We returned the Eddie Bauer travel system for this very efficient combination. It's very stylish, too. The only problem is the canopy. It's not a very functional design. The Eddie Bauer completely enclosed the baby for all weather. The car seat sits too far and there are gaps where the two canopies meet."
5,excellent stroller,"I registered and received this stroller as a baby shower gift from my brother & sister-in-law. Many families I know prefer Graco over Peg Perego & that influenced our decision in picking a stroller. I put it together by myself (9 months pregnant) in about 20 minutes. After reading thru the directions and trying out all of options, I am convinced my husband and I made the best choice when we registered! It is easy to operate, not really heavy and the colors are perfect for a boy or girl. The matching car seat fit securely and is also easy to use. A great stroller for anyone who wants a product that will last! The hardest part was sliding it out of the box!"
5,"si no has escuchado ""velvetina"" no has escuchado nada en espa&#65533;ol!!!","Sin duda alguna el se?or Miguel Bose es la inovacion y arte andando. He sido su seguidor desde que apadrino a ""Timbiriche"". Compra el CD+DVD no te vas la vas acabar! Te recominedo celeste amor, verde canalla, velvetina, hey max, paro el horizonte y down with love. Que esperas?!?!?!?"
5,LOVE THEM,"I love these headphones! The sound quality is fantastic, and i really love them. They are by far the best headphones i've ever used. I recommend these to anyone!"
4,nice sound!,"For the cheap price tag these things sing, and while an audio nut will probably opt for a 200 dollar pair they'll have to admit the retro look may just be worth the okay sound.Personally I'm not an audio nut, so for me these sound just as good as any pair or headphones, so from that perspective if you don't car about the tiny sounds you may hear if you're a master at hearing the little problems these are for you."
1,"HORRIBLE! False Advertising, Terrible Customer Service, and Never got what I wanted!","I am more than dissatisfied with this product! When I found what I was looking for on the site, I placed the order, expecting to get what I wanted. I was not only sent the wrong item TWICE, but could not get a sales person from Amazon to assure me that if they sent out another one, I would recieve the color that I originally ordered. The picture on the site did not even give the option of the color they had sent TWICE! I am sorry I ever wasted my time, and money, using Amazon--NEVER AGAIN!"
4,super story,"This comic story reflects on an stoic population who doesn't believe in passion. All Kryptonians have is a sterile world, emotionless society and a culture based on logic.It reminds me of stoic Vulcans in Star Trek."
2,good but with no heart,"The story about the end of Krypton and how its people mange to wipe almost all there existence , and how this device manage to change superman to become a true Kryptonion, with no feelings or desire effecting kent image in the process & with that almost loosing his life when facing a new equal in strength enemy. Interesting indeed , but with all the talk & non feelings envolve make it worth 2 stars in my book"
5,Arise the of the past!,Watching these old GI Joe shows really take me back! I know everyone been saying something thing like this but the hummer these show have. Small jokes really catches me now more then it did back them. Love the action but its the little things that make its great! Love the trash talk between Wet Suit and Sarge! I can't wait for some of the other movies that came out. Like GI Joe and Cobra joining up to take out a drug lord! I know there more other seasons and I be waiting for them and ordering them as they come out!!
3,Not as good as the first season.,"I totally understand the glowing nostalgic reviews on here, but I just finished watching the second season, and it's just ok. It's not bad, but it just isn't as good as the first season. With the exception of the introduction of Serpentor early on in the classic ""Arise Serpentor, Arise"" multi-episode saga, there isn't that much interesting going on and it seems even more like a toy commercial for series 5 of the toy line. Cobra Commander is marginalized by Serpentor, and the Cobra ranks are sort of in disorder, which for me kind of diluted their badness rather than adding to it. There are some pretty 'out there' episodes that are worth watching just for their sheer weirdness though. This is when a lot of kids started watching other shows back then. I'm glad I saw it but I wouldn't watch it all again."
4,A picture book of motorcycles.,Like a kids book about motorcycles but with more technical information. The art work and pictures of modern motorcycles alone make this book worth the modest price!
5,Simple and Best,"As I always want to apply the rule ""keep it simple stupid"" for my trading, this book is the best I ever read and this is really, simply, and practically help me making my trading decision and building my trading system. I now start making money using this techniques and follow his rules, I get more and more confident in trading.. But I dont know for those who wants complexities.I adore this book and personally offer highly respect and thanks toMr R C Allen for his genuine and valuable contribution to trading."
3,it's been a long time...,"... since I have been able to listen to the music on this recording. I owned it on vinyl, but since I threw out the specific hardware to play those, I have to work from recollection here. I seem to remember three or four nice tracks, some instrumental fillers and the sound of a squashed tomato with some wry comment by Donald Fagen. All in all, an album for the die hard Steely Fan, nowhere near their later work, not from any point of view. Enjoy."
3,for the Die-Hard Fan,I go to Hear the Music for this Film&while there were some moments nothing quite Captures what is yet to come from them later on there Career's.now Steely Dan&Richard Pryor are a Heck of a Fit for me.I Dig there Genius&thought-Provoking Vibe.wish they could have gotten back together when both were in there Creative Peaks? nevertheless the Music here has some interesting elements.
1,The Things People Do For Money...,"Youd be hard pressed to find ""Steely Dan"" in this soundtrack, and youll only see a glimmer of it-in the content. The Dan has a way of speaking for the underdog and acknowledging our dirty tricks at the same time, and they dont fail to do it in these songs. However you will find yourself laughing at Donald Fagens voacls on the first track. The final song ""When it Rains"" is worth the whole album, but the rest of it is just tolerable."
5,OOPS! [Addendum to My Previous Review],"Just a brief correction to my preceding review...my comments regarding ""The Poacher"" should have been made about ""Stone,"" which is actually on Ronnie's second Slim Chance album.After the success of ""How Come"" (No. 11 in the UK), ""The Poacher"" was released as the follow-up single. Unlike most of Ronnie's simple arrangements, this song contained elaborate use of a string section. While it retained much of the folky feel of his signature sound, ""The Poacher"" did not better than No. 36--his final appearance on the charts."
5,A wonderful book to help you understand Alzheimers,"It's a wonderful book. Its power is in the innocence and simplicity of the quotes. It moves you from complete unawareness of the disease, up through recognition and understanding.I bought it for my husband, whose mother is in the middle stages of Alzheimers. He read it, or should I say, devoured it, immediately. Then he bought one for his sister (he didn't want to give away his copy).It's a text book on the progression of Alzheimers, written by people who were there, and woven into a beautiful story. It brings about a sense of peace after reading it."
5,The Courage of Love,"I was overwhelmed by the brilliance of this book, which highlighted the depth of the author's understanding of living with Alzheimer's Disease. The author had surrounded her husband with love as she learned to deal with his progressive neurological condition. She also portrayed in a remarkable way the differing situations of others who have struggled to understand, care for their loved ones and to maintain and develop self-care. Knowing the author personally, I am not surprised at the charm and creativity which emanate from this lovely book about one of the most devastating illnesses we can imagine. I was truly blessed to have been one of the support group leaders for families of people with Alzheimer's disease; I am not impartial since I have always been in awe of the author's concern for others,her unconditional love for her husband and her own unique gifts of style and grace."
1,Not helpful,"I found the book hard to read and to follow, unless you already know how to use the program. It states the information in a way that reviews the procedures in a dry format, which is fine if you using the book with a Premiere course.The book needs to do a better job at grounding the reader about the world of DV. It doesn't so I was confused as I was trying to understand the content. Big ideas need to be discussed, then discuss the details.I decided to buy some video tapes on the topic, which were amazing. Maybe a program such as Premiere is difficult to learn from a book. I have read many computer books, which have helped me with other non-video editing programs. I guess this program is just hard to teach through a book."
3,Adequate not great,"The organizational structure is not as logical as it could be, for example, capturing video is at the end of the book. Not great for a ""hands on"" manual. It did not seem to offer any great advantage over the Adobe manual. Repeats really simple concepts (how many times does anyone who has used Windows or Mac need ""drag and drop"" explained in elaborate detail, whether related to moving or copying video clips, audio clips, or files) at the expense of other essential concepts."
3,"""Visual Quickstart?"" - I don't think so!!!!","Peachpit must define ""quick"" completely differently than the rest of us. ""Up & running in no time""...I don't think so. This somewhat overwritten volume is strictly for reference. P6 is an extremely complicated program, especially for newbies, and the Bolante book will be a bit of a disappointment (given its title and accompanying hyperbole), to those who expect some sort of how-to-do-it.However, because of P6's myriad of features and capabilities, and given the Adobe User Guide has carefully avoided graphical displays as much as possible, (a little ironic?), Bolante's tome is currently serving as a concise reminder of picune chores that P6 demands. Why can't these software geniuses get it right for a change?"
3,Ear of Beholder,"I think Lol Coxhill is an intriguing artist, and the CD duly requires devoted attention - which I regret to say is not what I got it for."
4,ok,This rod work good and does the job well the only thing is that it smells like wet cow when it burns.
5,Everything You Wanted To See About Buk,An excellent & well laid-out book displaying the life of Charles Bukowski. The book shows the real people & places depicted in Buk's poems & stories. It even has a photo of his grave which brings it home that such a lively individual is no longer with us even though new books of his unpublished/uncollected poems continue to be published. Alan/2001
4,"A strange world, an unapologetic man","Wow! There is definitely a whole world where Allie Mcbeal-esque angst does not exist and I think I like it. Bukowski, of which this book was my introduction, is wholly unapologetic about his life, loves, lusts and somewhat audacious lifestyle.I was going to say that Bukowski is more a man's writer than a women's although I wondered about the reaction to that as so many women clearly love him. But his writing is so steeped in the seedy, upfront, hard-nosed male appealing style. Maybe it is just that it is that I only know males who have read his works. Either way he is a strange fish. After this I went on to read a book of people's impressions of Buck, much more informative I think. In this I felt a little like I was left with his reflection rather than a clear insight into him.An interesting way of meeting Buck to see if you like his stuff, or him at all."
5,Ann Wigmore Rocks,"Seriously, she was really a pioneer...and did many great things for others, unselfishly, to promote global healthcare. As to the book, another great Wigmore book with easy, clear and precise ideas one can readily put into motion...and soon be eating delicious sprouts all year long, using her funky recipes. If you're a city-dweller, she also explains how-to for apartment living. Great book to offer to any beginning living-foods vegetarian you may know. Good investment. Reasonable price."
5,Sprouting for any level of gardening,"Terrific! A wonderful book on sprouting for many a skill level. Getting started couldn't be easier, as she provides several methods, along with helpful charts and recipes. Sprouting is a simple way to lead a nutritious lifestyle, and this book details the process quite well. (p.s. - the section on composting is an added bonus!)"
5,The Sprouting Book,"Great book - lots of info on all types of sprouts - why to grow sprouts, how to and what to do with them - love the recipes. While i have done some sprouting - this book has certainly expanded my horizons. I've been experimenting with many different kinds of sprouts."
2,Not what I thought,"This book is ok because it has a few tasty sounding recipes, but I thought it would be more in depth on specific sprouts and sprouting techniques. I read the entire book in a couple of hours and I am not a fast reader. I wish I would have just checked it out at the library. The book is mostly about the authors dietary beliefs in which I do not follow. Pretty much a useless book for me. Maybe if you are a raw foodist and are looking to eat sprouts for most or all of your calories this would be a good book for you. I wanted more info than this book provided."
3,"A good video, but a short fight","Watch Tyson demolish Michael Spinks in 91 seconds. Actually, the best part of this video is watching the clips from some of their other fights.Don't buy this unless you can find it for less than ten dollars. Who wants to pay full price for a 90 second fight?"
4,The soft cover is broken,"I love this book (Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach, Fourth Edition (AIAA Education)).But the soft cover behind the hard cover is broken when I received it!"
4,"Christopher George fans! PLEASE e-mail Paramount and request ""THE IMMORTAL"" be released on DVD!","Hello fellow fans!The late Christopher George (Sgt. Troy in ""The Rat Patrol"") starred in the science fiction TV series ""THE IMMORTAL"" (1969-71). After you've ordered ""The Rat Patrol"" from Amazon, PLEASE take a moment and shoot a quick e-mail to CBS/Paramount and request that ""THE IMMORTAL"" be released on DVD. ""THE IMMORTAL"" was a Paramount production. Paramount's e-mail address is: PHE_CustomerService@Paramount.comThank you and best regards to all!"
5,good series,This series is exciting with lots of action. Many parts where filmed to always show the good guys winning when in reality you know 4 guys can never beat 100 guys.
3,old war stories,"The Rat Patrol has it's moments...some very good moments... When the next set comes around, we might get it."
2,Where is the Yam Who Remix????,"If you look at the ""Somersault"" CD single on itunes, it has an amazing 8:24 remix by Yam Who. If that remix is on this CD single, then it definitely deserves 4 or 5 stars. If it's not available on the CD, get yourself to itunes immediately and download this baby. Yam Who takes what was a good song and elevates it into the stratosphere with dynamite percussion, haunting organ, and sweet strings. It is truly an experience not to be missed!!!"
3,"Sorta kinda romance, sorta kinda funny sometimes","It is hard to call a book a real romance when the hero and heroine are hardly ever together, there are only a couple of very tame kisses, and the hero isn't in his real body except about 20 pages of the whole book. If you don't look at it as a romance but fantasy, it is more interesting. The main attempts at actual humor are with subcharacters from among the Mount Olympus Greek Gods. I found the hero's situation more sad than funny a lot of the time."
4,"A fast, fun read!","Paranormal romances aren't my usual genre, but I couldn't resist this unusual twist on the Beauty and the Beast tale. It was a delightful story! All the characters were extremely likeable, even in their curmudgeonly states! The detailed descriptions of Idaho and Oregon were beautiful. I particularly love books that center their story around a restaurant. I found the part about the Fates to be a bit confusing and hard-to-follow, perhaps because I hadn't read the two earlier stories in this series first, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book one bit!"
5,"A ""must-have"" instructional guide","Rise Of Nations computer gamer, strategy guide writer, and RTS expert Michael Rymaszewski, is an in-depth and ""user friendly"" guide to the computer game ""Rise of Nations"". Offering detailed walkthroughs, analyses, and recommendations for every level, Rise Of Nations offers advanced tactics and strategies for solo or multiple-player games, as well as screenshots, meticulously delineated plans, in-depth stats, and a great deal more. Rise Of Nations a ""must-have"" instructional guide and continuing reference for dedicated players of this complex and involving computer game."
1,Practically Useless.....,The bulk of the information provided in this manual is easily learned through playing the game at the lower difficulty levels. There are few if any practical strategies discussed in any detail. It appears to be merely a collection and rewording of the descriptions of the Nations and their respective strengths and weaknesses.....The book is a waste of time....
1,Order gone bad,"The sender sent me a textbook covered with duck tape. The order was misleading by stating that the condition of the book was like new.However, Amazon made sure I received my refund. Although I had to pay for the return of the book, I was glad to get my refund."
2,Old Version,This book is not the newest version available. It would have been nice to get a notice as to the availability of newer versions of this book. The book itself is in good condition but the information within is outdated
1,Intro to Group work practice 7th ed,The book took more than a month to arrive. I emailed the person in charge and they never reply. I email them a second time and finally I heard from them and they told me the item was going to arrive soon that they had mail it. Very bad customer service.
2,group work practice.,"I loved the book and it was as it says it would be, however I was disappointed with the length of time it took......(almost 4 weeks) to receive the book.... and I am still missing a book I ordered that never came, ( from different person.) I will not be using Amazon again. I will go back to my previous purchaser.thanks...."
3,Style and No Substance,"""Crackers"" aspires to be offbeat but only succeeds at being mundane. It's not a bad film just an eminently forgettable one. Shocking when you consider the film was helmed by Louis Malle coming off the success of ""Atlantic City"" and has a pretty good cast. None is more wasted than Sean Penn who plays a dimbulb good ole boy. Sole redeeming qualities are the turns by Jack Warden as a genial pawnbroker and Christine Baranski as a randy meter maid. The film's denouement is pretty clever. Too bad the rest of the film didn't demonstrate as much wit."
5,Another Donald gem,I love to find Donald Sutherland's earlier or little known gem of a movie like this one. Have been looking for it for quite some time on DVD. Would recommend this seller
2,Beware: NOT the original versions,"This isn't a live album, it's a lengthy compilation of 999 songs that were all re-recorded by the band. I don't know why '77 punk bands insist on doing things like this (the Vibrators did this also) because half the appeal of old punk rock is the stark and raw nature of the music. Why redo it? If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Unfortunately, most of 999's good stuff is available as import only, so this might be your only economical choice."
3,Hiking the Grand Canyon,"I received the DVD and the book Hikernut's Grand Canyon Compagnion in excellent condition and good in time! No doubt!Unfortunately the quality of the video is in poor condition (read OLD).Both, DVD and book are very helpfull to organise the hike I was/am planning. For example; I learned that I am much too late to book my stay at the bottom of the canyon! ;-("
3,Good overview. Hiker's should do more research.,"If you are considering a trip into the canyon then the video is interesting and entertaining, otherwise bland. But if you are considering a trip into the canyon the video is woefully inadequate. You need to do much research on websites and with books. It is nice to see real life pictures, but I doubt I ever play it again."
4,Worthwhile for the first-time or casual Grand Canyon hiker,"A good, complete introduction to the corridor trails including helpful information about the geology, and practical hiking tips. More experienced hikers may find it to be a little basic, but what do you want from a video that is, after all, about the heavily travelled main trails. If you are hiking these trails you are probably either a first-time or casual Grand Canyon hiker anyway. I wish McNamara would do an advanced sequel with information about the less-travelled trails!"
4,dusty workhorse,"Smooth, strong, ergonomic. I'm very satisfied with the job it does sanding. My main gripe is how much sand it spews. I have a downdraft sanding table and a large air filter, and this guy still fills the air with dust. Even worse, the seal around the cloth bag recently failed (duct tape partially fixed it)."
5,(classic),"I own just about all of the official Smog releases from the gritty home tape recordings, to the newer albums that will keep some steady friends around. This is by far the best (Smog) album that I've heard. Think Leonard Cohen meets The VU w/a touch of beautiful pedal steel over the top of it all. This album really is amazing and it embraces all of the different stylings that Bill Callahan employs throughout all of his works. From violent pop songs set over a cheary beat (ala Ex Con), to the isolated and introspectiveness w/a gritty sense of humor (es Stranger). This album really hits home. The one thing that may annoy new comers to this album is the heavy handedness of all the symbolism that reoccurs throughout the album. To me it's perfect but to others it can possibley ware you down. If you get this album and are looking for more Smog to listen to then the next logical step is Knock Knock. If you own Knock Knock and want more of the same then pick this one up."
2,This is not the standard battery,This extends about 4 inches from the back of my ibm x40. Clearly not the battery in the picture and not the standard extended battery. It works but it's not what was shown in the picture.
1,Wrong shipment,The shipped battery is not compatible with the X41 laptop. It is a different model and.
5,Gripping adventure!,"This book tells the amazing, almost unbelievable, story of two adventurers who navigate a hostile and souless river--through crocodiles, bandits, hippos, blinding sand storms, malaria, voracious insects, civil wars. In addition to the gripping and compelling adventure, the history of the Nile and the surrounding regions is explored, the politics of Africa are discussed (including the impact of US involvement), and the impact of poverty and big business on the environment is explored. For those who are fans of Everest adventures, their are lots of comments regarding past attempts on the summit. Don't miss the IMAX movie, either. It is amazing. For Christians, I must warn that this book contains strong humanist themes--""There they discover a mirror in which they see their own faces, and learn that the savior they sought was within themselves""--which are disquieting. However, I loved this book--it painted pictures in my mind that will remain forever."
3,"Great looking shoe, but slant is wrong for me","The shoes look great and arrived in good condition. Unfortunately, the front of each shoe has a noticeable tilt or slant towards the inside. I could get the shoes on, but my feet were uncomfortable; I would not want to try any significant walking in these shoes. I imagine in addition to length, width and arch, feet have a front/back angle, and I would encourage those with more angled feed to try these."
2,Runs small,"My Dad wears a 13, and this shoe was too tight for him. He'd need at least a size 14, and preferably a wide."
5,The Next Best Thing to Being At Saratoga,"Sean Clancy's Saratoga Days is a must read for horse people, and anyone interested in the beauty and history of Saratoga Race Course and Saratoga Springs, New York. Sean takes the reader into the rewarding and unpredictable world of horse racing, as well as the magical town that is so difficult to describe. Sean does this extremely well. The book is truly insightful, realistic and an absolute pleasure to read. Sean, please document additional years."
4,british garage,"this is raw garage r&b, british style from the 60's.It's along the same lines asthe early Stones and Pretty Things only a tad cruder.There are a few novelty songs which are an acquired taste but mostly it's nirvana."
2,What a turd ...,"I give it a couple of stars only because it at least had some actors that I recognized from some other slightly better, B-horror flicks, but overall this story is predictable, and uninspired."
3,Well worth reading - in spite of the final few pages,"Brunner is an excellent writer - realistic settings, well described, believable characters, interesting ideas. In this novel, however, the plot does not work. As a reader, one has the impression that after 200-odd carefully written, comparatively slow moving pages, the author felt, for whatever reason, that he should come to an end. He abruptly did so, in a quite unconvincing way. Thus, forget about the final few pages. The rest of the novel is well worth reading."
2,Early Brunner - The framework for other stories,"I just found an old copy of this book and being a Brunner fan I had to read it. The story itself is an interesting one, as a psycologist has to question everything he has learned, including his own sanity to work out the puzzle of a woman who does not fit anywhere.The story rambles along, I found it a bit slow. What was interesting is that it is like a testing ground for other Brunner novels. I can see shades of _Times without a number_ and _Children of the Thunder_ in this book. I am not sure which books came first, but the other two carry their ideas across better.Once again, Brunner is guilty of pulling the rabbit out of the hat with his endings. The ending is not so much of a twist but more a totally different road!Not Brunner at his best, but a good one to get if you like Brunner's stories, similar to the early pencil sketches of a painter."
5,Lady...what?,"Yeah, I know - if you are about my age, you might have a slight chance to have heard (about) this album, which is from 1974. Perhaps if I mention the name: Brian Eno - who is featured on the album - you nod in recognition, yet this album is something else than his ambient-sound music, 'coz in the center there is Lady June's voice - which is one of its kind. Not because she would sing beautifully or otherwise - this lady t a l k s!! But in a manner and surrounded with the sounds of the 70's which makes this album worthwile to own and always means a special time while I listen to it. During a long time I couldn't find it anywhere, until I searched for it here. I'm glad I did!"
5,A tough but rewarding read,"As someone who is permanently ""slightly anxious"", I wanted to understand the root of that anxiety and hence what could be done about it. Horney offers the theory that children who feel threatened develop an idealised view of themselves as a defence mechanism - but this in turn creates further problems in adulthood as the adult fails to live up to the ""perfect self"" expectation. Horney illustrates this thesis convincingly from both case work and literature - several of the illustrations described exactly what goes on in my own mind.So, if you're serious about a serious read, this one is for you."
5,"Give This Woman At Least 5 Stars, If Not a Nobel Prize","I respect the opinion of the two-star reviewer, but I can only guess that this person is either too young, or simply not crazy enough, to appreciate how Dr. Horney ""nailed"" the essential problem of one's vital energies being disastrously diverted to the service of the idealized self. A welcome oasis this is for those thoughtful souls who are sick and tired of suffering and want to get on with the business of living. All positive-thinking self-help books -- or programs -- will fail the true neurotic unless this topographical map of the counter-productive Unconscious is studied, understood and committed to memory. Just like knowing how to get around town, when you're in a strange city, if you know what I mean. To characterize this work as a masterpiece is no exaggeration."
5,Excellent read!,"The book came as quickly as promised in great condition. It was recommended by a friend. A lot to take in at first, but worth the effort. It's best to read for information and not to place guilt or blame on anything or anyone in particular."
5,excellent basic,This classic text offers foundational material upon which decades after volumes have been written. It is a basic text and vital for understanding subequent psychoanalytic thinkers.
4,Interesting,"Looking at neurosis from a Dr.s point of view, very very interesting, but some parts of it I could not grasp. Very good read though, my friend who was going to psychology school had to read this book and told me about it, that's why I ordered it, it sounded very interesting and it is."
5,review,book's great. very informative and insightful. karen horney is a fabulous writer and uncovers the layers of the neurotic patient's personality descriptively and accurately.
5,Another great Calvin and Hobbes treasury...,"It's another great Calvin and Hobbes treasury which includes cartoons from ""The revenge of the baby-sat"" and ""Scientific progress goes boink"".You'll love this book of cartoons which includes some of Bill Watterson's best voted strips like the comic strips ""tiger food"" and ""Eenie Meenie...""!The things I love most of Watterson's comics are the jokes, sarcasm, character expressions, colourful drawings, and great backgrounds.In this book you'll be able to read lots of club strips, Rosalyn stories, and family trips to places like the museam! You'll also be able to read lots of Spaceman Spiff and dinosaur strips.This book would appeal to people of all ages from perhaps the age of eight to adult."
5,This Book ROCKS!,"This book is extremely funny. It has every charecters, and lots of laughs. It's my fave comic book. Thanks, Bill Watterson!"
5,Indispensible : My favorite,"I started reading C&H from this one and now have the complete collection. I rank this one at the top, (alongside the tenth ann collection). Another reason is that it contains some of the poetry work by Watterson. I am a fan of his poetry too. Sounds similar to my own..."
5,Calvin and Hobbes: the Indespensible Calvin and Hobbes,This product was delivered quickly and was in good condition!Thanks so much!
1,Totally inappropriate,"I bought several copies of this book to store away for Christmas presents for my grandchildren and other young friends....ages 7-12.The book, in diary form, starts off well and is, actually, delightful reading.Why the author(s)(I think Ambrose's family contributed to the final copy) decided to throw in totally inappropriate sexual scenes is beyond me.The young man who is the protagonist of the story loses his virginity and impregnates a young Indian girl by the 4th or 5th chapter. The description of his sexual debut is frank and tasteless.Now all I have to do is try to figure out what to do with 10 useless copies of what could have been a wonderful opportunity to learn American history in an interesting format."
2,The first 100 pages,"made me realize that I should read the dust jacket before I start to read. I didn't realize that it was 'youth' fiction, and I agree with everybody else that the sexual content is inappropriate."
1,do not buy,We threw this book away and would not recommend this book to any young man due to too much sexual content.
4,Not as good as I was hoping,"I was expecting more from this CD. Do not get me wrong, it is good but I was just hoping for more."
5,Powerful,"Joe Rogan is on par with the greats like George Carlin. Brutally funny and perfectly crafted. I have listened to a lot of his podcasts and his stand up stuff is always totally different. I had never heard the topics covered the way he does in his CD. Must buy. Totally worth listening to a few times. Just be careful whom you share it with. Ask yourself: ""Can they handle it?"", because it's not for the faint of heart."
4,Virus Hunter - an outstanding read.,"C.J. Peters has had an extraordinary career, which he generously shares with us. This is an outstanding read with rare insight into the world of emerging viruses. Phenomenal."
4,"A nice Companion to ""The Hot Zone""","What an interesting read!The author is a great storyteller, who brings a human (and humorous) voice to some of the world's deadliest virial outbreaks.Read this as a companion to ""The Hot Zone"" since it talks about some of the same people and situations."
5,Pete the Great,"Everyone who is interested in life threatening diseases has come upon the name of C.J. Peters, a leading figure in epidemiology for at least 20 years. So, when i saw the book i bought it just to get an insight of the man himself. What i found was an inspiring manifest of how ''the job gets done'', written by a deeply stuborn, sensitive and respectfull scientist. It is not only a fine book on emerging diseases, it is also a call to medics and politicians alike to enlist to one of the most important, yet underated, scientific fields. Don't miss it."
2,Virus Hunter: Better stick to medicine,"Virus Hunter was based on fascinating information but was presented in a choppy and stream-of-consiousness style that made reading it boring and tedious at times...I especially disliked the ""mini-resumes"" of the various people mentioned in the book. These were needless details. Dr. Peters has the background to make for interesting stories, but I did not feel that this book was well written, and I would not read another book by Dr. Peters."
1,wrong size,I ordered this and it was too big for the recipientso I sent it backcompany was very good on return and resending another shirtcathy
5,Quality shirt,"This is exactly what I was looking for. It's light and comfortable, perfect for an undershirt or jsut to use as a regular shirt. Some UA shirts I've bought have been skin tight(without saying that on the label) these fit perfectly loose on the body and the arms are loose and the cuffs are a good fit. The only thing I'm not liking too much is the label is on the outside back right below the collar, seems odd to me."
3,Weird fit,"It's a good material, and it fits well in the shoulders, but it doesn't taper to the waist at all. So it doesn't look that great."
1,Scratchy,I like the look and fit but after a few washes it got pretty rough and would cause uncomfortable rubbing on the chest. I talked to UA customer service and they mentioned that the poly blend is not the best...it's not the newest UA technology. I wouldn't recommend it at all...go for the newer models.
3,undr armour,Good shirt for sun. Has a different texture and feels warmer then other shirts but does shield out rays
3,too big,"Ordered this for my daughter,ordered a small and was way too big. She said it worked under her softball uniform so we kept it."
3,Overpriced....,"I purchased some from Target and Wlalmart that were pretty much the same quality and fit and material.Sure Under Armour is THE brand name for this type of apparel but nowadays you can get cheaper alternatives from cheap department storesthat not only look and feel the same but are 30-50% of the price.I got these for myself and my brother and we both love them . They serve their purpose,they wick away moisture (quite quickly even in Hawaii where I'm from)and when you're cold, put these under anything you're wearing and you'll feel VERY warm and tight.IF you are really picky about the quality, well then get these and maybe you'll see a difference but I don't think they're worth it.The fit was looser than what i'm used to as well...."
3,its ok,have used it once... its alrightalthough its really difficult to buy clothes that you haven't actually fitted and touchedwas expecting a different kind of fabric when i was clicking on itbut anyways its all good
1,Don't waste your money,"This shoe rack seemed just what I was looking for, but I am so disappointed with it. The top tier keeps sliding down, and the rod in the middle is wobbly, it just won't stand up straight. I tried fixing it, but it just cannot hold up to the weight of the shoes. I saw reviews for this product on different site, other people had the same problem. I didn't find anyone who were happy with it. I am now looking for a different way to store my shoes."
5,A refreshing change of pace...this book was good.,"I had three sources of study materials for my CISA exam which I took in June 2005. The CISA Review Manual, MicroMash and Exam Cram 2. Of the three the Review Manual was probably the most complete, but the Exam Cram 2 re-organized the materials better and made better connections between the information and real life. MicroMash was just too dense for my tastes. As a recommendation I would have to say for those of you planning to take the December test: get both the CISA material AND the Exam Cram 2 book. Read the section in the CISA book and then read the corresponding chapter in the Exam Cram 2. It really helps. I passed."
4,May be the only book you need to pass the CISA,"I just received my passing CISA score from ISACA's 12/05 test. I had both the official exam guide and this book. 90% of my reading was out of this book and overall I think the book is excellent. It seems to contain almost all of the information in the official book without all the superfluous text.DISCLAIMER - I am a person with over 10 years of IT experience and over 6 in security specifically. This material is not new to me and therefore the Exam Cram worked well for me. It may not for you.Lastly I'll say that the CD that accompanies this book left a bit to be desired. It's FAR better than the Boson tests I looked at, but in the cases where you want an explanation for an incorrect (or correct) answer, look elsewhere. In many cases the CD simply plays a movie that basically says ""The correct answer is A"". Very disappointing. The best questions seemed to be from the ISACA CD IMO. Hence 4 stars instead of 5."
1,Very Limited,"Short and simple, this book is a bad buy. It does not provide enough detail to answer the test questions. The test is extremely difficult and this book provides aid for only 10% of the test questions."
3,Check the copywrite,"The transaction was good, the book came pretty quickly. The one problem I had was that the copywrite was different than what I had previewed online. When I was checking out the book online, the sample had a copywrite of 2009 but the one I received was copywrite 2005. I'm just using this as a reference, but a deciding factor was the copywrite date, and it turns out it was an older book than advertised."
3,Information is dated.,I wouldn't recommend this book as a primary study source because a lot of the information is pretty dated now. They need to put out an updated edition. However it is pretty good at explaining basic concepts like encryption in simple terms that are easy to understand.
3,Review of Exam Cram 2 for CISA,"It's important to know if the edition is the current exam cram for the actual exam. The 2011/2012 CISA exam is broken into different topics. This particular exam cram 2 book is a 2005 publish date and so it's not for the current exam. However, the information is very helpful."
3,Questions,"All topical based questions would have been separated from answers, it doesn't make sense to read the question while the answer is just displayed beneath."
1,Medicore at best.,This will help you understand a few key points that the Isaca material fails to do on any points. I hope that Allen Keele's boot camps are more in depth than this book. The sad part is that this is one of the better study materials out there. I hope someone can produce a book for 2006 that matches Isaca test objectives...in a nutshell this book is way to shallow to condsider for serious study preperations.
4,Small reducer dies,Item works great.The stretcher does a good job. The only thing i didnt like was the reducer dies only take a band of around 22 millimeter max diameter and each die needs sanded and polished to help prevent ring scoreing and scratches.Other than that it does a good job.
5,Ring Sizer,"Service was prompt and efficient, and product was as advertised. It arrived sooner than expected, and I am very pleased with the heavy duty quality of the ring sizer. It works well!"
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"I couldn't believe this book received more than 4 stars. Or 2 stars for that matter, which I think it warrants.Yes, it provides a good overall picture of what day-trading is and would be a superb book for the beginning practitioners who wants a better picture of the background of day-trading. But if you're looking for trading ideas and strategies, my advice is to skip this book. The chapter on technical analysis is flawed. There were a variety of charts which looked good on paper, but that was with the benefit of hindsight. In practice those analysis would never have been possible.There's too much at risk if you put your money on the line using the trading ideas here."
2,Inaccurate info!,"This book tries to cover a wide range of subjects in one go. It could have been useful for the *complete* beginner, if only the information given did not include so many factual errors. Get separate books for each of the various subjects you have to study: execution systems (ECN's, SOES etc), technical analysis, money management. Do not believe that one simple book will make it for you. You have to work hard before you are able to play the game."
1,WORTHLESS,"What a joke. I have never read a book with more erroneous, misleading information. The only person who stands to make a dime from this waste of paper is the Author. Skip this one!"
5,A masterpiece!,"""Electronic Day Trading to Win"" is a masterpiece!! A must-read for anyone seriously considering a career in day trading. Bob Baird and Craig McBurney, the authors, explain the process in such a clear, straightforward manner that the average layperson with no background can easily understand the material, from concept to execution. I would guess that even professionals in the field could benefit from this book."
4,I would have bought this sooner if I knew....,"Too bad this book wasn't called ""Daytrading for Dummies"", I would have bought it sooner! Baird and McBurney put together a great manual that teaches the neophyte how all of the levers and buttons work in the world of daytrading. EDTTW also goes over all the daytrading terms that everyone assumes you know in good detail. Whereas Jeff Cooper's Hit and Run book gives you the roadmap to the daytrader's promised land, this book teaches you how to operate the vehicle to get you there."
1,A Total waste of Money,"The authors engage in an endless discussion of irrelevencies. Not good work. A much better book is Strategies for the Online Day Traders by Gonzalez and Rhee, which is really fine work and a must buy."
2,"Promising idea, but unsatisfying and meandering book","The first half of this book gives an interesting, but repetitive, history of the number zero and its religious enemies. The second half of the book discusses the problems zero introduces in physics equations, from the birth of the universe to its death. The author is obviously enthused about mathematics, physics, and history. He has some cool ideas, but this book is not that great. It meanders and repeats itself. Plus the author shrouds the real content in too many unfunny puns about zero and infinity."
3,Not much more than a decent review of the history of science,"This book provides a solid history of mathematics and science in layman's terms. If that is what you are looking for, then this would be a decent book for you. If you are already familiar with Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and Einstein, then this book will not contain too many surprises.The author tries to make zero and infinity the center of not only math and science, but also of religion. He relies upon a barrage of platitudes like ""God was found in infinity - and in zero"" to make his case. While science and religion certainly have a complex relationship, the author cannot provide much substance to his arguments.For those looking for a solid review of the history of science, I would recommend Mlodinow's ""Euclid's Window."" For those looking for an interesting history of a specific number, I would recommend Livio's ""Golden Ratio."""
1,This book should rate a ZERO.,"The book wandered around a bunch including a stupid ""proof"" that it was better to be a Christian than an atheist. Most of Seife's text was just boring and poorly argued."
2,"Good coverage, annoying style","The book covers a fascinating subject in a fair amount of detail. However, if you prefer thoughtful and well-worded books, this one is NOT for you. The author has overloaded an otherwise interesting work with too many verbal embellishments and glib expressions."
5,Extemely Thought Provoking!,"Previously, I had never really thought about this subject- but it's fascinating because zero has such a rich and interesting historical background! I couldn't recommend it enough! It's not for anyone who wants to be spoon fed information, it is for the intellectual in all of us. Give it a chance, and I PROMISE you will not regret it! I primarily read nonfiction because I love to learn and I am somewhat of an audodidact (sic). Buy this book, and you will not regret it."
3,"Ok, but I'd Suggest to Read One of the Other Zero Books","The philosophy and history of the concept of ""nothing"" is an interesting one with a lot of repercussions. I can't really say that Seife did it justice, though. The writing is not as focused as it could be, some sections getting repetitive and his analogies don't quite work. And, quite frankly, I don't know why anyone would spend time describing Pascal's Wager without pointing out how logically inconsistent and culturally biased it is. In short, not a bad book, just not really recommended. Especially since others have tackled the subject."
3,"Simplified and contrived, interesting at times.","The history of mathematics: or, how every mathematical concept ever relates to zero (or infinity) in some contrived way.Could have been great if it wasn't for a few over-simplifications and the constant barrage of contrived relations to zero."
5,Highly Entertaining,"I am a math teacher and read this book on recommendation from a fellow math teacher. The book is well-suited for high schoolers (as far as concepts go), but can also be used in middle school. I start by saying that I find history, even the history of math, fascinating; my emphasis in teaching is on the ""why"" and often times, that answer is found in history or in the field of ethnomathematics. Not only is the book educational, it is extremely well written. Often times it is even funny. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history or math."
2,"Interesting Topic, Poorly Written","This book contains many interesting tidbits of information and a general timeline of the concept of zero that is intriguing. It is sometimes a battle to get through the author's meandering style and I was tempted to put the book down many times (but the information kept me reading). If the author took out all of the times he wrote something like, ""but they didn't recognize the power of zero,"" the book would be half it's size and much better for it."
3,"Okay, but covers no new ground","Zero is an interesting number, especially if you try to divide by it. That is this book in a single sentence.Seife (who, amusingly has a name similar to ""cipher,"" which has the same word origins as zero) starts this book off as a history of mathematics and the usefulness of zero in mathematical thought. He then goes off into physics and the zeroes associated with absolute zero, black holes and the big bang.While Seife has created a book that is quite readable and has a lot of good illustrations, there is very little that is original here. Anyone with a familiarity of math history would know everything in the first half of the book, and anyone who has read anything about modern cosmology would be familiar with the second half.Since this book does not get too deep in anything it covers, it might be a good introduction to these ideas, but for anyone who already has encountered these concepts before, this book offers little."
2,"Distracting, confusing, bloated","This book's discussion of the development of the zero-containing Arabic numeral system and the calculus are valuable examinations of modern mathematics and its sources. Too bad the reader has to wade through so much distraction to get to these nuggets of knowledge.The pages of this book are filled with strange non-sequiturs and philosophical wanderings that have nothing to do with the topic at hand. ""Zero"" also has a questionable, at best, sense of humor (did we really need so much detail on Martin Luther's constipation?). And the last third of the book, covering applications, physics and cosmology, should have been left out entirely-- it's confusing, incoherent and totally out of place in this book."
3,"Okay, but not great","Early part of the book, giving a lot of history, is interesting, but once zero makes it to Europe, the author basically proposes that zero is the reason for everything that follows historically, from the toppling of Aristole's view the universe to the Reformation. A little over the top, to say the least. Last half of the book gets a wee bit too mathematical, as zero then is the reason for quantum mechanics, relativity, etc. Seife may be correct is part, but his claims come across as being a little too energetic and too short on proof."
4,This book is no Zero!,"For someone who is not a math buff, but who appreciates a good story, this book was a real treat. It is an excellent and sometimes humorous read and I came away with a much better understanding and greater appreciation of how math is related to the social and theological development of the modern world, and too, how much further we have to go. While at times Seife got long winded in details, it brings home the importance of math to those of us who are not math folk. An excellent book that I recommend to every math teacher as a means to bring relevance to the subject, and to every student whos teacher hasn't read this book! I'll be giving it for Christmas presents this year."
3,Greater than fantastic! Infinitely great!,This book was absolutely brilliant! It engaged me the entire time and I was fscinated at the paradoxes. It also inspired me to come up with my own paradoxes of zero!
3,zero is more than you think,"At first I thought I got a loser of a book, but it soon turned to something that pulled my interest. That zero is a recent concept in mathematics and how it developed is very interesting especially for those who think they know about everything there is about everything, like I do. It does fill that gap. After reading this book, I do know everything. You posers are a little light without this book."
4,"Good, interesting book!","This is a two part book where the first half is about the history of zero and it's view through civilizations over time, and the second part is about the scientifical applications in modern physics and mathematics. It is well written and explain things in a clear and direct way, however it does not go very deep. Overall: GOOD"
3,"Where Music, Art, Science, Logic, Infinity, Notingness and Religion Become One","This book can be read on two levels: 1) History, insight, personality and amusement or 2) technical terms and formula. Most of us will want to forget the second part and concentrate on the first part. Do that and this is a really good book.Read for the first reason, this is a fascinating, enjoyable, intriguing, informative, even useful read. Read how some of the great names in mathmatics, history, logic, even religion, lived and died, how the church killed people because they believed in zero, the void, the nothingness and the infinity.Read for the second reason--logic, high math and calculus--it is above most, if not all, casual readers.The key is knowing how to read the book, knowing when to read, laugh, learn and be amused and when to skip over the technical ""stuff.""This book is highly recommended--you will find it fascinating, amusing, sometimes amazing and educational--if you read it right!!"
4,good way to learn some math history,"Never realized zero was such a big deal. Whole philosophy hides behind that little symbol. If your scientific minded at all, you'll enjoy the book."
5,Should be required reading in school,"I wish I had read this book back in high school or early college, back when I was struggling to see the point to the endless equations in calculus and understand some value to the seemingly endless required math classes. The work was dull and I was infused with a belief that I would never need to know one bit of it once I walked out the door after my finals.That last sentence is more true than false, but if I had read Zero -- and really got the sense of wonder behind calculus, I might not only have enjoyed the class, but also found reason to use it.Seife has the journalist skill of making the complex simple without eviscerating it. He also has the ability to take something so potentially dull as math and turn it into a fascinating examination of history, culture and life."
4,Much more than mathematics,"I was initially skeptical about this book, because in the early chapters I felt like Seife sometimes presented questionable anecdotes as fact. Plus, for the chapters that I knew the most about, I lamented the lack of footnotes, which isn't really a fair criticism of a popular science work. The book quickly won me over, though, and I often found myself reluctant to put it down. The story presented here is about much more than math: there's history, philosophy, religion, and modern physics too. Much of the material was already familiar to me, but Seife brought it all together into a satisfying overview of the evolution of western thought. I would recommend this even to people who don't particularly like math; it's not very technical and is full of information that would be interesting to anyone."
3,Zero,"This is an interesting book that has some flaws. The most fascinating were the earlier parts of the book that addressed the various cultures around the globe and how their practical needs and philosophical points of view affected their mathematical development, and how the number zero fit into that big picture. As the book progresses the author tries to address cosmology on larger and larger scales, and he stretches things quite a bit. There also seemed to be a good bit of filler. I think if the author had stuck to the more mathematical side of the story this could have made for a really great extended magazine article, such as you might read in The Atlantic."
5,Eye-opening and fun,"This was a great book. I took it on a trip, and it provided sufficient reading for a couple plane trips and a couple boring nights. Though written by a mathematician, it's appropriate for nearly any audience, and I've had no trouble passing it off to friends who aren't engineers.If you'd like to understand how zero came into the number system, what the religious and philisopical implications and resistances were, and how zero plays a central role in current scientific research, this book lays it all out concisely and pleasurably."
4,4 for 0,"0 is a fascinating concept and an interesting number. It is well described by other positive reviews. It is a much better read and much better written and than Longitude or A History of Time. I was a bit disappointed when the author leaped from math to physics. While the former is pure the latter is an approximation. I was interested in the concept and the philosophy of 0 from a numerical perspective and did not find enough in the early chapters to be satisfying. Somehow, 0 showed up in India. Though I was disappointed with the leap to physics, it was logically very well presented to be enjoyable and understandable, I did learn a few things and it connected a few things up very well though there are a few leaps of faith. Good job Charles Siefe - enjoyed it a lot."
5,hilarious and true to life,"Every adult who I have shown this book to, has laughed out loud. Every parent or grandparent who has watched a toddler ""fling"" the gift on the floor to obtain the light, colorful, deliciously crinkly tissue paper, will enjoy this romp."
4,Good quality at a good price.,"For the price that you pay for, these headphones do a very good job. They isolate noise fairly well since the headphones encloses my ears. My friends have told me that there is some leaking where if the volume is too high, people sitting next to you will be able to hear what you're listening to.Definitely recommended to those who would like a stylish pair of retro headphones that gets the job done.NB: The headphones were smaller than what I expected. They are not the same size as the big aviator ones back in the old days nor the same size as the ones used in Language Labs."
5,"retro and descent sound, Right on!!","I have been looking at these headphones for some time and finally received them for Christmas this year. They look just as cool in person and the cans are not too big. They give off some pretty good sound. I have yet to listen to anything I felt was made worse by these headphones, if anything they're a major improvement from my crummy laptop speakers or ear buds that are continually falling out. If the volume is too high there is some leakage but thats not been a problem for me. Overall I love them and feel they're well worth the money for my casual listening."
4,Bulky but lasts long time,"I bought these in 2007 and now it's 2011 and these headphones are still pretty dang good. The material is cheap plastic, but I've put these headphones under a lot of use and they still hold up. I would have bet money that the cord would have shorted out by now, yet it's still as good as it was when I bought it.My only complaint has been that these are a tad bulky. I love the retro look, but it's actually not very attractive when you wear them in public. It makes your face look fat."
4,Nice,"The only problem may be that the ""leather"" on the headphones might crack depending on care. I gave two of the headphones as gifts and one pair had deteriorated while the other hadn't. So I guess just make sure you take care of it."
4,"Stylish as can be, sound is passable, comfort is all right","I bought these around 2 years ago, and I've been very pleased. I always get compliments on the aesthetic of the phones and that's why you are buying them right?They sound as good as you'd expect from $40 headphones, not worse but not better. If you sweat and use them and leave them in the sun the cups will eventually crack, but then again I've had mine for around 3 years now so it's about time they get replaced.Lastly they will remain comfortable for around 5 hours which is really nice, people with smaller ears may have even greater comfort wearing themVery solid product, will buy some again once I find them again."
5,Best show of 2002,"We're halfway through the year, and this show is BY FAR, the best show SCI has played this year. The band seems to really enjoy playing at Jazzfest, with their annual performances at Jazzfest always seeming to represent the best or one of the best shows of that particular year.Highlights of this show include the first set-ending ""Birdland> Cissy Strut> Texas"", and the Second set ""Land's End> Hotel Window"" is spectacular as well.If you're only going to buy ONE OTR show, *THIS* is the one. You will not be disappointed!"
5,Effective! What more need I say?,This is perhaps the 3rd or 4th reorder of this product. I love it! I've compared prices of like products and found this the best. I love how easy it is to just add cinnamon flavoring to teas and other products. No more icky residue like that left by ground cinnamon!
4,Great product..Good value,"I bought this because I saw it on a talk show, I researched this & found it to be very good for you& that it was the best price here than other places I checked."
1,Lobelia Extract is what you'll get,"I just ordered this product. When it arrived, I opened the box and took off the bubble wrap. The bottle I got was Lobelia extract! This herb is also known as Asthma Weed, Pukeweed, and Vomitwort... I don't think it will taste much like Cinnamon.The bottle ships in a bubble wrapped bag. The bag had a sticker for ""Cinnamon Bark"" on top of the correct sticker reading ""Lobelia""... I would not order this item until Amazon fixes the warehouse stock labels!"
3,Please Don't Hate Me For Not Loving It!!,"I do not know if her writing has changed or I am outgrowing her characters, but I do not feel that this lived up to LKH. This is the last hardback I purchase of hers. I loved the 1st in the series, but this one was a real let down. I really feel she gets Anita(see Anita Blake series) confused w/Merry.She seems to be rushing thru these books and not giving them the previous depth that the others had. I did not feel that her characters were as well developed as previous novel and it lost my interest about 1/2 way thru. Forced myself to finish, and like I said, will no longer eagerly await her books, or purchase hard backs.From now on I am a paperback used book store girl for LKH until she goes back to better development. I would recomend 1st book in series and Anita Blake series 1-6, lost me on those after that."
3,L.A. Isn't Cohokia,"The second installment of the series finds Princess Meredith (Merry Gentry) back in a cramped apartment in L.A. and continuing her work for the detective agency. This time she has her suitors with her. The attentions of her suitors take up much of the book. The Unseelie court and most of the tension, menace, and anticipation are still in Illinois.While several plot points play out, the monsters, violence, and danger which I have come to expect to be dominant players are relegated, for the most part, to the background. I miss the machinations of the court so prevalent in the first book of the series. Menace through mirrors doesn't have quite the same effect.Having said that, the book is still worth reading and it sets up many potential plot lines. Included in these are more of an introduction to both her family and the Seelie court, and the near future release of her rival and cousin Cel. The end saved it for me. I look forward to seeing where some of the characters end up."
3,A Promise of things to come-but still waiting,"This story is going to be SOOOO GOOOD-if she ever gets to it. Like a Kiss of Shadows, A Caress of Twilight is still laying groundwork for this story.At the opening, we find Merry and her harem three months after the end of A Kiss of Shadows. I'm not going to tell alot of the plot, except to say it thickens-greatly.We now have more villains and more subterfuge. One of the things I do like about this book is that she has toned down the graphic sex, although there is still some there for the horror fans. It is now an adjunct to the story instead of the story forming around it.There is also a bit of preliminary action in this book that at least gave a minimal closing to this installment. I wish I could give half stars, because this one honestly deserves not quite 4, in my view.I am hooked on the cliff-hanger and am honestly awaiting the next book. If they all live up to this one, it will be a killer series!"
2,Where's the plot?,"I knew I was in trouble when I had read over 150 pages, and Merry and her guards had been to a meeting--that's it. Hamilton used to write really different erotic horror novels, but both this series and the Anita Blake series have of late been suffering from severe plot anemia. Hamilton has fallen into the worst of writer's traps: she tells rather than shows. If you like reading detailed physical descriptions of beautiful and unusual men, you'll like Caress of Twilight just fine. Otherwise, my advice is to wait until this comes out in paperback. It's definitely not worth the price of the hardback."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A large part of the whole Sidhe political conflict is the issue of succession. This means that whoever of the next generation that can produce a child is likely to get to be the boss, or at least, stay alive.It doesn't really look too good for Meredith, because she has copious amounts of faerie meat in her bed, but none of them knock her up. Pretty likely, the problem is hers.We get to see a few Sidhe powers and other information as the Grey agency helps out an actress who is really Sidhe."
3,"A Caress of Twilight (Meredith Gentry, Book 2) Mp3 Format","My purchase of ""A Caress of Twilight"" was in MP3 format. I listen to my MP3 collection on both my MP3 player and my ipod. It works great on my MP3 player, but to my disappointment this MP3 is not ipod ready. I would like to have known that before I made my purchase. Better yet I would have liked the MP3 to be ipod ready. Ipods aren't going away. I would rather buy my MP3s on disk rather than downloading them, but I won't give up my ipod."
1,Completely boring,"Probably one of the most boring books I have wasted time on in recent times. No plot: casual sex that is justified in a puritanical way (we are only being naughty you see, because I want to get pregnant) is no substitute for a story. Endless repetitions of lengthy description - who is wearing what - or not (equally boring). Meetings of several factions without interesting dialogue. The monster and the solution at the end smack of jack hopping out from the box since a built up plot is missing. No excitement, nothing to hold my attention.Conclusion: One star because the system does not allow to give none. Don't waste your money."
4,very much LKH,"After reading all the Anita Blake novels, I decided to follow along with the Merry books. I have almost an addiction to Ms. Hamilton's novels, regardless if I have become somewhat disenchanted with her Anita Blake series after about the eighth book.I found Merry to at least start out relatively page-turning and read ""A Caress of twilight"" in two days.The imagination LKH has is great, but the overabundance of sex can be a little overboard. I find myself sometimes skimming over pages to get past lines like ""He rolled his eyes up at me while(something NOT G rated!)"". At least I've found this series to have more plot than the last of the Anita series.Bottom line is if you are a fan of Anita Blake, then you will like Meredith Gentry, but these books are borderline soft porn and not for the fan of Harlequin Romances..."
1,I just want to be done...,"A friend gave me the first book in this series, I liked it a lot. So I picked up the second one figuring it would tie up all the loose ends and finish the story.... I was wrong... Onto book three, where nothing at all happens as far as plot. When do we get answers to anything that happened in book one? Why is this story being draw out so far? I doubt I'll read book four,unless it's the last one, the story wasn't that good."
4,Good enough to want to know what happens in the next book,"I found it to be slow at times, but very well written. I like the course the story takes and the fantasy world created. I can't wait to hear what happens in her next adventure."
4,don't buy the hardcover,"I love Laurell k, I own everything she writes. But I was somewhat bitter about paying so much for such a short story. Merry is fun; i think some of the men have as much potential as richard and jean claude, but they just aren't as cool. Plus, hamilton cannibalizes herself big time. gee, a beautiful man with a scared face who needs acceptance? Next time a merry book comes out, i'm going to wait until it hits soft cover. honestly, if i didn't love everything by this author, this would probably be a three star book."
4,Good - but not as good as she gets,"Merry's latest adventure is a great read - i read it in a marathon session overnight. It is truly Hamilton, and the prose is high style. The only disappointment i had with this book was it seemed as if it were missing parts - sometimes the action or narrative would seem to skip, especially toward the end. In any case, a great read for anyone who enjoyed A Kiss of Shadows."
1,"At least I got to the end of ""Narcissus in Chains""","I laughed so hard, I couldn't finish reading the book. Somehow, I don't believe that was the author's goal."
2,Wait for the paperback!,"Laurell K. Hamilton must have been rushed to get this one out. If you are a fan of hers, and I am, after having read this book you will understand. This book will make you think of a short story that has been added to (to fill in space), but nothing is added to the story. There are many, many, sex moments. The mirror is used in place of a telephone, and there are many, many repeated incidents of using the mirror. And the details of what every character is wearing, or may ever wear, at any given time is graphically and boringly repeated everytime the scene changes.I have been a LKH fan since her first book and hope that this is not a trend caused by becoming a bestselling author. But I would still buy the paperback!"
2,Slow paced story,"The premise of this book (and its predecessor) is great: fairy princess as hardboiled detective in L.A. Her non-monogamous relationship with a variety of supernatural guardians is an interesting plus. However, this novel moves very slowly. It is painfully obvious that Ms. Hamilton is planning to stretch Meredith's story over a long series of books and is taking her time in doing so. It is awkward when a character in a book written in the first person stops to describe herself and her beauty in detail. There were too many scenes involving her sitting on the bed, in various stages of dress or undress, having magic mirror telephone calls. The actual plot of the novel was quite thin."
2,"Been there, done that...","""A Caress..."" focuses more on Princess Meredith and her harem's relationships. The big bad thing doesn't come into play until about the middle of the book. Its defeat was anticlimatic.The book in general seems to set things up for the third book. I hope Ms Hamilton takes a break so that she can provide a fresh and suspenseful story in the third installment. Because ""Caress"" wasn't it. At the end of ""A Kiss"" I wanted to know what happens next - even though I feel Princess Meredith is just a revised version of the Anita Blake character from Hamilton's Vampire Hunter Series. However, at the end of ""Caress"" - I can't say that I care what happens.I'll keep my fingers crossed and wait very patiently (and hope it pays off) for the next book."
4,"Liked this one, too, but...","I liked this second book in the Meredith Gentry series. The plot and world-building was interesting, as was the fey political intrigue. That said, sometimes the narrative got bogged down with lengthy political explanations. This occurred several times in the book and it slowed down the action too much for it to be a page-turner for me. Other than that, it was a good addition to the series and I'm looking forward to the reading the next one."
2,Something's Missing......,"I've been a huge fan and follower of the Laurell K. Hamilton's work for several years. After reading the first book of this new series, I was looking forward to the next installment. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this book.As I read this book, I kept trying to figure out what was missing, then it finally hit me, the plot was missing! Most of the book consisted of their preparations, discussions and arguing. When the ""big"" fight seen did finally come, it was way at the end and quite anti-climactic.I'll probably try the next book in this series just to see if it improves. If not, I'll be sticking with my favorite heroine, Anita Blake."
2,porn anyone?,"I picked up this and the last Merry Gentry books thinking that it would be an interesting change of pace. I didn't realize that I was just picking up strange, fetish pornography. I felt like the plot revolved around a very weak core. The entire plot of the series so far is to have sex repeatedly until she's pregnant, and describe all of the beautiful men she's going to bed with and how they do what she enjoys. I really hoped for more, but I guess Ms. Hamilton has taken to just writing pornography. Between these books and her most recent anita blake books, I am tempted not to read any more of her stuff."
2,"A Step Up, A Step Down","Definitely better than NIC, but not quite up to par with the earlier books written by LKH. Has her popularity gone to her head? Lately, she relies on frequent, and pointless, sex to carry the plot, instead of having a real story going on. I've been reading her work since Nightseer. I'd hate to have to stop, but if the books don't improve, why waste the money? As is, I don't recommend buying this book in hardcover. Wait for the paperback, or buy it used."
4,Good escapism!,"I enjoyed this book.I think you have to consider the source of your entertainment before you can pass literary judgement. If you want a classic,...read a classic.I wanted to read about faerie folk and I wanted to be entertained, this book accomplished that very well.I look forward to the next book in the series!"
5,Laurell Hamilton Fan,I've never been a big fan of fantasy type books......with fairies and such. But once I picked up these books by Laurell Hamilton I couldn't put them down. I completely lost myself in the world she created. An excellent read......all of them! And that includes her Anita Blake books as well.
2,Where is the plot?,"I'm a huge Laurel K. Hamilton fan and found this lacking a true plot. The politics and interplay of the guards were an interest but it soon became boring. The book did keep you turning the page just to see if a true plot and sense of direction would emerge, but it just never happened. Also what happened to some steamy sex scenes, and descriptions of outfits and nude bodies just wasn't enough."
4,Good book in a long list of good books,"Caress of Twilight is not as good as the first book in this series, but it is still worth a read. Hamilton does a great job of creating really interesting characters and situations with plenty of erotic overtones. This book isn't quite as good as the first one, and it doesn't move the story along with Prince Cel being stuck in torture for 6 months but it's still a good read."
3,"Worth reading, but did not devour!","I am a big fan of the Anita Blake series and I really enjoyed the 1st book in the Meredith Gentry series. However, this book did not contain the ""spark"" or excitment that I am use to in her books. The last four chapters did get to that level but there were 2 big ""baddies"" to face and 1 is handled by a simple sentence like...""Rhys had no trouble putting the xxxxx down."" (Don't want to spoil the book for anyone). Something else is that Meredith is not that much different from Anita in this book. While reading it I keep thinking about Anita (that was not a problem in the 1st book).I see this book as a stepping stone to setting up the next book. As I understand it, this series is a 7 book series. Other than the major event at the end of the book, not sure why this was written. Don't get me wrong, it was a good enjoyable read; but below what I have come to expect from Ms. Hamilton. I was going to only give it 2 stars but then realized it is worth 3 stars."
2,A bore of twilight...,"I was disappointed in this book. It had the usual wonderful character descriptions and smooth flow, but lacked the substance of her prior works.Previous books by Ms. Hamilton just grabbed you by the collar and dragged you through the story steadily building to what you knew was going to be an awesome...ending and ultimately leave you craving for more. It seemed that this book just ""lolligaged"" its way through a story and then it seemed that she realized that she was almost out of paper and just threw in the quick ""last 5 minutes of Star-Trek"" ending that kind of neatly wraps it up, but leaves you disappointed and craving for ""something"".It seemed to me that Ms. Hamilton just ""phoned"" this one in. I am disappointed, but still a fan, and I anxiously await further works, but in a different way. I find myself hoping new works will make up for this one, rather than just assuming it will be great like all of her great stories I had grown accustomed to."
3,Wasn't what I expected,"I love LKH, I loved her ABVH sereies, I loved Kiss of Shadows....what I didn't really love was COT. It was just really hard to get into. I mean I loved that another of her books came out, I was waiting for it but..sheesh.Merry is just starting to relize what she needs to do to get other to look at her with repect. Remember Kitto? The little goblin? Well he's half sidhen and has come into his power. Oh yeah Merry has another hand of power. She is now Princess of Fleash and Blood.If you do love LKH's Merry sereis, you should get the book. It's very informitive adn it you're waiting for the third book and don't read COOT, you're gonna miss alot."
3,frustrating in the extreme,"In general, I love Laurel K. Hamilton's books.As other reviewers have noted, the plot point here is that Merry is supposed to be trying to get pregnant before her cousin Cel can father a child. Thus, she has lots of sex. My question is: why doesn't she spend some effort trying to TIME her conception? Don't sidhe ovulate? If sidhe don't work that way, I'd love to hear an explanation. Given that many (most?) of Hamiltons's readers are female, I'd think that they'd be interested in a digression about sidhe reproductive biology. Merry's failure to consult a fertility doctor frustrated me for the whole book.I agree with other reviewers that the ending was rushed. I'll read the next one because I hope/want that it will be better, but this book was frustrating."
3,Entertaining Read but lacking substance,"I have read every book Ms. Hamilton has written, and unfortunately she is starting down the path that authors such as Anne Rice and Brian Lumley have already walked for a long time. Repetition is creeping into her stories. The parallels between Anita Blake and Merry are becoming too obvious - a challenge beyond the characters' ability with a great mystery, several red herrings, something very sexual, and then boom! a climax with a large release or discovery of power.I did enjoy the story, and I like the way Merry is moving from victim to power player, but I am growing a little weary of the format. I wish Ms. Hamilton would take a fresh approach to building her stories and characters.I will definitely read the next volume, and I will keep reading until the story comes to a logical conclusion or Ms. Hamilton completely flops, but I hope the next book is something different."
3,Series is looking up,"I almost didn't buy this book after reading ""A Kiss of Shadows"". I have all of the Anita Blake series but between the last couple of books in that series and the first one of this I amost wrote Laurell K. Hamilton off as a writer. I am glad I changed my mind. This book is starting to develop the characters beyond the who is sleeping with who mark. The characters are actually developing into beings that you care to read about. There is a small plot line in this book involving good and evil with a twist on who the bad guy really is. If the series continues in this manner I will be happy to buy and read more."
3,Shows the Promise of Her Earlier Works,"While the quality of Ms. Hamilton's writing has degraded in her Anita Blake series, and the first Fey book was a pale shadow of that series, this book shows characterization and patterning that is distinct and interesting. I feel that there are a few problems with pacing and Deus Ex Machina here, but most readers will enjoy this book as a fun romp. It isn't on par with the best of Fantasy, but if you like Honor Harrington, the Three Musketeers, or faerie tales you might like this series, and definitely this book."
3,Wonderful bridge book,"Hamilton does a wonderful job of character development in this book. It's a beautiful setup for the rest of the series, and reading about the relationships, conflicts, and passion between Merry and her men was great fun! Ms. Hamilton seems to have skimped a little on the plot though. The plot line was a great idea (a monster called ""the Nameless"", a movie star who was exiled from fairy, political intrigue in both courts), but it wasn't developed enough at all. I don't want to give it away for those of you who haven't read it yet, but the ending also seemed very abrupt to me, as if she had actually written a longer book and cut it back. The writing over all was good. My only complaint was that she used the phrase ""and well you know that"" WAAAAAY too often. I found it jarring in a book that otherwise flowed very well. Caress of Twilight wasn't as good as Kiss of Shadows, but it was a good light read that I hope is preparing us for a fabulous third installment in the fairy world!"
3,"Great characters,but","As with all of her previous books, the characters, sex, and personal conflicts are wonderfully executed.Ms. Hamilton has a gift for creating wildly imaginative worlds and characters. I was anxiously waiting for this book and immediately sat and read it in one day. It was good, but the mystery plot was a little thin. I had the feeling that this could have been an exceptional book had more attention been given to the detective story line, instead it was a good continuance of Merry's story - more of a filler, rather than the exceptional stand alone book it could have been."
3,interesting,"It took the first book to really get a grasp of the set up of the ""fairy underworld"" for want of a better name. ITs not a bad read but after the third book i have lost interest. Maybe because i had just read the 21 books of the anita black series and my brain does not need any more series at this time. After the third book it still seems that not a lot has really happened with the storyline."
5,series is awesome,I love this serious!! I can never put the book down once I get started. I finish reading each one quickly and duffer waiting for the next
4,It's all good!,"A novel mix of fanstasy, horror and soft porn. The author ties all the plot strings together and does a really good job of keeping track of what has been done in her previous books. She is very good at creating new characters and merging them into the core crew. I'll be reading more and hope you will to."
4,Instantly addicting.,"I have gotten hooked on Laurell Hamilton books. I started with the Anita Blake, Vampire slayer books and when I ran out of those, I started the Meredith Gentry books. With the Anita Blake books it took until about the third one for me to become truly interested. With the Meredith Gentry books I was hooked by the middle of the first one."
3,Like eating frosted donuts,"A sexy book, yes, but weak, plot-wise. I'm not a big fan of Hamilton's prose, as I feel that she oftentimes spend too much time saturating her characters' dialogue with superfluous description than just delivering the points. I have a feeling the book wouldn't have had half as many pages if she hadn't described every single piece of dialogue or action with no less than fifty words. Despite that, the novel was entertaining to read and has interesting characters. I find myself rooting for a certain character now to win her affections (and the throne) and am intrigued enough to buy the next sequel."
5,The world's best candle for lavendar lovers,"If you love lavendar then you'll love this candle. Lighting this candles will take you in a deep and peaceful state of relaxation. Your entire room will be filled with the soft, gentle scent of this wonderful plant."
3,Great Introduction To The Theory Of Cities,"This book is a good book, but not for any of the reasons one would normally associate with a fun read. Let me just say that this book is not fun to read, it just is not. Rather, it takes quite a bit of work to wade through Weber's insights into the nature of cities.So I will do you a favor and let you know what he argues influenced the development of cities. Weber argues that the development of cities in European culture as an autonomous associations with its own municipal officials was influenced by three factors. First, the religion of Christianity. Second, privileged legal position of the citizens (based upon citizen's obligation for military service). Third, decline of religious sanctions of kinship solidarity that facilitated creation of unified urban community. To get to these insights would require a lot of effort, and I am not sure that these views into the natures of cities would be worth the hassle for most people."
5,What a relief!,"I had constant back pain due to a compressed spine from sitting in a police car for years, wearing a heavy police belt, and gaining just a bit of weight around my middle. The docs tried everything to help me and I finally found relief on a lumbar machine. I used this regularly for a couple of years and am fine now. I have not had any spinal problems for years now. I had one of these in my home and it was easy to use, move, and worked great. I highly recommend it! It was very comfortable and I could use it with NO help from anyone else. What a relief!"
4,pokemon fan,"I like it. it does have a on and off switch, it is under the bottom just open the velcro and pull out the white box and the switch is on the top of it.and it will stop talking. i think it is a cute toy."
3,"Interesting, But Barely Audiable","In my office, I have an ever growing collection of these electronic plush toys, ranging from the Cookie Monster to Scooby Doo. Please understand, I work in Information Technology and we do things like this to help dumb our brains down from time to time.At any rate, picking up a Pikachu seemed like a logical addition to the collection, but I was actually very disappointed how *quiet* this thing is. For parents with already too many noisy toys this might not be a bad thing, but for me it was.On the other hand, the fact that it'll start blabbing almost at random times is fun, but regrettably not enough to make up for the low volume."
4,Fun Toy,"This toy is not meant for young children who like to be very rough with their toys (throwing, stomping, etc.). It is very cute. It is good to hug when you are sad, lonely, etc. I am 9-years-old and my Mom is typing this for me."
4,An exciting tale of a great 20th century illusionist.,"I highly recommend this book if you have an interest in magicalhistory. Bamberg not only relates his personal experience with manygreats (family friend of Houdini, Thurston, Okito) but has a wonderful storytelling style. He was quite a character with an amazing life story to share. At times, i found myself laughing out loud. The book beat all of my expectations and is highly recommended."
4,The Seventh Slice: Part 3,"For the 25th Anniversary of TMNT, LionsGate released Season 7 in four part DVDs.Season 7 Part 3 Episodes are:Convicts from Dimension XThe StarchildThe Legend of KojiNight of the Dark TurtleWhite Belt, Black HeartAttack of the NeutrionsEscape from the Planet of the TurtleoidsThe special feature is A Shellabration of The TV Sensation: New Interviews with the Hit Show's Creative Team.I only bought the season in four parts so I could get the the miniature TMNT toys. I recommend others to buy theTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete Season 7 Set."
5,Love SOA,"We don't have cable and Netflix was taking forever to send the discs, so I brought the season and loved it. Can't wait for season 5!"
5,Sons of Anarchy,"Always looks like the end.....never is. Incredible plot twists and character development. Never thought my eyes would tear up over a 'biker soap opera'! Great songs throughout, also. Good job fellas!"
3,Son Of Anarchy: season Four,"The case came broken and one of the disc was not placed in correctly causing it to slip around inside. Had to buy stuff to fix the scratches on the disc, I haven't played all disc to see if they play well or not."
2,Disc Four did not play correctly,"The product came wrapped as advertised and in a timely fashion. But when I got to the fourth disc, the playback was flawed and I missed the last half of the final episode!"
4,Brand New DVD's Skipped,"SOA is one of my favorite shows on TV right now. I ordered Season 4 to catch up and get ready for the Season 5 premiere coming up next week. I'm extremely disappointed because the BRAND NEW DVD set skips. A whole entire episode was skipped through. Needless to say, I'll be returning the DVD to Amazon and hopefully exchanging it for a non-skip DVD."
5,Must see show!,"You have to watch all seasons. This show unravels into chaos, love, friendship, murder, aggression and much more. It will keep you wanting to watch episode after episode. Start from the beginning so you can get all the information as this show is intensely overwhelming if you don't. I highly recommend watching this show. Totally worth every penny."
5,"One of the best, most intense shows ever.","SOA is supremely well written and the acting is amazing as well. I can't get enough of this show. I'm not generally into this specific genre, but the criminal themes in this show are so much less important than the themes of family, loyalty, and sacrifice. Every character has a reason for being there and though there are some bimbos in the show, the majority of the female characters are strong and bad-ass. I would watch this show every day if that was an option. Anyone who watches can't help but get sucked in, so if you don't need another show to watch, don't start watching this one... you won't be able to stop until you have no choice. Can't wait for season 5!"
5,Great,Sons Of Anarchy all Seasons are a must watch.First time i saw sons went on a 6 day marathon great.
5,Amazing,Easy download great quality watch when and where I want I can watch on iPad iPhone ps 3 and laptop. Love this service and love my sons
2,Disc 1 didn't work properly,The last two episodes of disc 1 wouldn't even work! I was very disappointed. But this the 1st issue I've had with any of their DVDs.
5,LOVE THE SHOW,"Great acting .... a show that brings out all emotions (laughter, hate, saddness, love) istruely rare these days !!"
2,Weakest season so far,"WEAK story, gets all tangled up in itself. I am sad after each episode how they are doing this one. After last season's amazing Ireland season, they seem to be shirnking back the show to make up for money spent last season."
2,sons of anarchery season 4 episode 1,"I have purchased from amazon before and loved the service. This time however, my purchase didn't show up in my video library. I did everything exactly as before, so what gives? I hope they get this fixed so I can continue to purchase with confidence."
2,WTF.......,"WTF.....what else can I say...This episode had very little action and nothing turned out the way you would have wanted/hoped. Yes, they left it open for another season, but there was no closure to this season really. It was very open ended and felt more like just another episode rather than a season finale."
1,love the show but....,"I love this show and was so excited to watch the 4th season on my ps3 via Amazon. I ended up have to return the purchase because NOTHING has CC (closed captioning) !!!!!!! As a hearing impaired individual, it is imperative that CC be available. I was extremely disappointed. I won't be ordering anything else until the option is available. Sadface."
2,This show is out of ideas,"I burned through the first couple of seasons on Netflix and liked those OK. However, I have picked it back up this year on FX. And I have to say, it's hard to like this show. Bunch of hard dudes having hard, deadly serious conversations with gravely voices. Jax is the worst. Bunch of hard dudes meet for a deal. Talk real gravely. Start shooting. Lather, rinse, repeat.Lame."
2,Still awaiting arrival,The title states my concern. I just want to receive this so I can proceed further. I have not any disappointments with the process until now.
3,Sons of Anarchy: Season 4,Was mainly interested in the theme song of the show; the rest of the CD is just OK but not sorry I purchased.
5,"Love SOA, Great DVD",My wife and I are big SOA fans and being able to sit and watch the previous season without commercials is great. The price made it even better... Thanks Amazon for the great bargain!
5,looove it,it is just a really great show love the new season so far ill continue to rent the old seasons on here
4,Son's of Anarchy Season 4,"Our son got my husband and I interested in ""Sons of Anarchy"" and we were able to watch through season three last year but missed all of season 4. We were happy with the quality of the Blue Ray Season 4 and are now happily watching season 5. Great series with perfect characters...good and bad!"
4,SOA is always great!,"This season is no different for SOA - it's great and really sets up the next seasons nicely. I really enjoyed this season. If you're looking to get into the show, however, I would recommend starting with the first season."
5,good show,I purchased this season for my brother n law as a christmas present. He loves the show. I've seen a few episodes and it seems pretty cool.
3,A Guilty Pleasure,"As the seasons go by, the show focuses more and more on scenes of extended dialogue between, and soulful close-ups of, various pairs of characters as they interact with one another and agonize over various moral dilemmas. It's a bicycle gang, for goodness sake, not Hamlet!! Even so, I can't stop watching, and each episode is still good for one shoot-em-up bloodbath. :)"
5,Sons of Anarchy: Season Four,"This is my Grandaughters favorite show. She missed a few shows, due to a heavy study load. Got her this for a gift, she loved it."
5,This show justs gets better and better,This show and it's characters like a fine wine get better and better. This is by far the most intense season so far in my opinion. You will find yourself talking or yelling at your TV to the characters. This is an absolute show to watch.
4,This time,This time the show worked without any audio problems like the last one we watched. Hopefully that doesn't happen again.
5,Sons of Anarchy,Excellant! Just as good as other seasons. Should get better as season progresses.This should go on forever. Definately recommed. Great Cast.
4,SAMCRO Junkie!,"This show is one of my guilty pleasures. The problem is I should feel guilty about watching it but I do not. The writing is fantastic. The actors are outstanding which makes for a phenomenal show. If you loved shows like, Deadwood, Oz, The Wire, The Sopranos. Then this show will appeal to you. It's about young man who is the son of the founder of a biker club. While attempting to find himself and figure out who he is and his role in the club he learns some secrets about his father, mother and the man he has loved as a father. It's a very interesting take on what occurs in the lives of bikers.Please check out IMDB and check out the list of amazing cast members.[...]"
5,YES,A big fan of this show - will continue to watch and love that I can receive without having to go and stand in line for it.
5,Season 4 doesn't disappoint,"I suspect that anyone contemplating the purchase of season 4 already knows plenty about the SOA series, so I will spare any descriptions or spoilers. Let me just say that season 4 doesn't disappoint. In fact, I think it is probably the best season yet and I am very happy with the progression of the story line. Can't wait for season five!"
5,Nothing Better,"This has to be the best drama that is on FX right now. The story line on this never drags or becomes boring. This episode was sad I thought Clay may do something to Piney but shoot him!!!! I look forward to seeing Clay thrown out of that head chair. I wish that Jacks would take the spot but, he doesn't seem interested in it anymore. Too bad Tara is going away so close to the end of the season. Lets just hope Clay doesn't get to her toO!!!!!!!All in all this series is excellent. If ur looking for a drama that keeps you guessing and transitions fantastically this is it!!NEVER A BORING MOMENT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The Program was good Just kept hanging up in areas,"The program picked up right where the other stopped, and would have great if it didn""t freeze up in places and we had to spend a-lot of time getting it to move on so maybe we missed a little but it was realy good and can't wait for 5 to come out."
4,Hope the series continues,From the onset of this program it has been a hit though there are people out there that have watched it and have blogged negative stuff but forgot to take into account that it is just a show
4,What can I say? Riveting TV at it's best.,"Right up there with Breaking Bad, Dexter, and Walking Dead in my opinion for edge of your seat viewing, and crisp, intelligent writing."
5,Great!,I would recommend this show to anyone! Service was great and showed up before it was promised - I could ask for more.
5,DAUGHTERS OF ANARCHY FOR S.O.A.,"Love love this series, it gets better and better every year, the bonuses on the dvd's are worth every bit."
5,AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best show on tv. I plan to buy the whole set when it's offered for sale. Thanks for your instant videos. I would have been lost without it .
5,Great as always,"All items I purchase are brand new as stated, they arrive quickly, and I never have any issues when buying"
5,AMAZING SHOW!!!!,"Love, love, love this show and so glad I could order the entire season 4 on Amazon.com. Had no problem loading the episodes to watch and I loved that I could watch them for anywhere when traveling."
5,Great Show!,This is a great show and I'm glad I'm able to watch it so soon after airing. Keep up the good work!
5,FANTASTIC,"This is, as always, a fantastic season. I absolutely love it, and highly recommend to all. Can't wait for season 5"
5,Freaking AWESOME!!!,"Heard about the show from a friend so I went back and started watching from the beginning. I hit a wall when I couldn't get season 4. Stumbled across Amazon's offering and couldn't be happier!!! Watched on my own time where and when I wanted. Awesome, awesome, awesome."
5,Season 4 Grrreat!,"I read all reviews and some say ending finale was not exciting? you must be kidding! It left us hanging and wanting for more, true? So what's not to love? I agree with one person who said that the series has gone 'beyond the normal biker MO' because it really has gone too far toward the outlaw bad guy image and it could make people think this is what all bikers are like and we know that's not so. However, I love the action, love the betrayals and secrets etc. and the thrills of what is happening and what is to come, keeps me on my toes."
4,Addicted to Sutter's storytelling,"Kurt Sutter is an amazing story Teller and has given dimension to some very distasteful characters. The show themes have been compared to Hamlet - and indeed the heroes in the show all have tragic flaws, I would add the Scottish play to the comparison with both Gemma and Tara showing strong enough traits to stare down Lady Macbeth while remaining almost likeable. The sexism and racism are indeed tragic and sometimes hard to watch but, unfortunately realistically reflective. This series goes on my tops list along with Carnivale and Deadwood, Dayton Callie and Ray Mckinnon being alumni of the latter. I hesitate to pick out specific actors. Across the board this cast has shown a range of ability unprecedented. The acting range of this cast is Juicy with deep enough plots to draw out rounded characters. My only complaint is the lack of Closed Captioning on the Amazon Instant Video."
5,I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!,This was a great season also just like the others. I recommend it to anyone who has not seen season 4.
3,Nice,"The videos were easy to access. A few of the episodes seemed like when the dvd is scratched. I didn't miss huge parts of the show, but it was irritating."
5,SOA is the shiznit,"Now thanks to this show I am convinced that the old man with motocycle that moved in across the street snitched on his club and is in witness protection. I am also a lot nicer to dirty, hairy white guys and old tired looking cranked out biatches (just in case they are someone's ""old lady""). These woods are gangsta! Oh, and Clay looks like a dayum Neanderthal, but Jax can get it."
5,Sons of Anarchy Season 4,"The show itself is great, but it is very frustrating to watch it on Amazon. It takes forever to load, and then when it does, it often stops and has to load again. Can this be fixed?"
5,Son's Season 4,"The dvd's arrived on the date of release and just as expected, better yet they were cheaper then when I preordered them."
4,Good Season overall.....,"But rather violent. The Sons of Anarchy is by nature a violent show; however, I have to say that Season Four seemed to up the violence quite a bit. The story lines are great and would continue to be so without the gratuitous violence. Here's hoping Season Five focuses more on the story and characters while minimizing the violence displayed."
4,Great action series,"Very good buy, but you really need to watch from season on to really appreciate this show. I hope the writers don't run it in the ground."
5,outstanding,had a bad CD in the first order form Hometown Video (not there fault)and they replaced it in record time without guestion. I will definitely be useing them again in the future.
5,As amazingly good as ever.,"I did not discover Sons of Anarchy until very recently. For the last several months, I have been immersed in the series. Season 4 is on par with Seasons 1 through 3. This is an extremely well-written series that keeps you wanting more. The characters are very well drawn out and the plot lines are interesting and action-packed. Very addicting series!!"
3,"Some glitches, but not bad","The content, of course, was fabulous! I love SOA! The video quality was just okay. There were some issues with downloading and playing some of the episodes. They would stop and start, and the picture seemed jumpy in all of them."
3,More Seasons = Less Action,"Hey. I love SOA and thought this was a great season. Except for the fact that the finale seemed more like a mid-season show. Everyone knew that Jax would be taking the reigns. Just because everyone knows that a 5th and 6th season have been approved, that doesn't excuse the finale to be so anti-climatic. I really hope they pick up the pace for season 5."
5,SoA Mixes It Up With A Cartel,Waited for season 4 and am anxious for season 5. SAMCRO lives up to their 'values' as each is influenced and alliances are tested. Ordered and watched it all from my ROKU box which was a simple process as well. The Cloud is a wonderful thing.
5,KICK A**,If you haven't seen season four this is a GREAT buy for the money to get yourself caught up and see where season five starts it's next sogga in the INTENSE season of SOA !!!!!!!!!!
5,SOA Season 4,Another strong season from Kurt Sutter and the crew of Sons of Anarchy! Hopefully they can keep the success going for at least a few more seasons since they've signed up through six or seven now.
5,***In Love***,ABSOLUTELY Love Sons Of Anarchy!! Best Show Ever!! It just keeps getting better and better!! Totally worth every penny spent!!
1,havent gotten my dvd,i bought this item about a week ago and still havent gotten it yet!i would like to have it soon
3,headspin,Seemed over-dramatized this season. Huge suprises throughout but somehow didn't feel the same. I was a bit disapointing. Think there is too much focus on the trivial matter of Jax leaving the club. No one really believes he actually can or will right?
5,Really exciting season,This was one of the most exciting seasons yet. The story line has always been building towards Jax being the leader of SAMCRO and now it's happening. It will be exciting to see what's in-store for Gemma and Clay.
5,great show,this was for my daughter. We watch the show too and now she can watch it whenever she wants. Always something unexpected on this show.
5,needed season four,"I liked the show and already had season one, two, and three so I bought season to complete the set"
5,Awesome show,"This show keeps me hanging from one episode to the next...It's great!! I've seen every episode at least twice...Can't seem to get enough...My favorite series, and this episode just keeps it building!"
5,great,I have the complete set now 1-4 and just waiting for season 5 to come out and then waiting for the new season 6 to start
5,Sons of Anarchy Season 4,"I bought seasons 1, 2 and 3 and this series is absolutely awesome! Season 4 was awesome as well. Can't wait until next year for season 5 to go on sale."
5,Can't Get Enought SAMCRO,I haven't been able to find another show to watch that doesn't bore me after watching SOA. Charlie Hunnam is something excellent.
5,Love the show,Its my husband and i's date night..so we choose to watch sons of anarchy. Its a great show and i would recommend it to my friends
2,season 4 is pathetic,"I've been religiously watching this show. The first three seasons were great, but then we get into 4th season which is pathetic. Some aspects of this season are just silly, and I know that a lot of you might think otherwise. Sorry to say, but after finishing this season.......hoping someone kills (you know who), I'll put this show to rest."
5,"Love, love love","My husband and I love this show. It's addictive, so watch out! Kind of like Sopranos but motorcycles instead of SUVs and California instead of Jersey."
5,Awesome!,This dvd is awesome. I didn't get to see the last 2 episodes so I was very excited to see this season come out on dvd.
5,SOA,I was thankful to be able to watch season 4 so quickly since it didn't come out on DVD way later.
5,Yet another amazing season,"I preorder this show every season,one of the rare things I buy for myself. This year is unlike any other and that is because its amazing and always one step further than the year before. Amazon treated me right with this because the Dvd went on sale a day before I recieved mine and they still sent my refund of what i paid. Once again excellent serve and if I could give it 10 stars I would."
1,Poor quality,"This was without a doubt the single worst purchase I have ever made in my life. The episode was on par with what i expect out of sons of anarchy. The quality of the video I received from amazon for my money, was absolutely terrible. At no point did the sound match the video for more than ten to fifteen seconds. More than several times throughout the video there was a delay in both sound and video, and extreme pixilation. None of which resulted in the stream synchronizing the sound and video. I do hope nobody ever makes the mistake of purchasing another video stream from Amazon.com! I do hope more people continue to watch or discover the Sons of Anarchy however, its a great series that immerses the viewer completely."
1,Horrribly disappointed,The dvd is damaged and the product is not as advertised . The DVD is choppy and continuously freezes up. I bought 4 seasons of Sons of Anarchy at one time and this seller is the only one who's merchandise was damaged and not as advertised
1,Where is it,Can't rate this DVD set yet as it was ordered over 4 weeks ago and has not arrived yet will keep you posted.
2,They've Lost Their Way,"Seasons One was focused, exciting and kept me interested; Season Two drifted with the Irish Connection and the baby drama; Season Three got the club back in business, but Season Four has lost its way. The writers have exhausted their bag of trucks. This series has come to the traditioanl hollywood ending--about two seasons after they should have quit."
5,lOVE THE SHOW,"Season 4, what can you say, the lead keeps flying and the wind keeps a blow'n. Out of sight. love it"
5,Excellent Season 4,"My daughter got me hooked on this show. Some of the things that happen in this season, I didn't see coming. Can't wait to see season 5.."
5,LOVE SOA !!!!!!!!!,"GOOD CONDITION, the dvd's are fine, no major scratches... hasn't skipped or paused yet :)beats paying $60 for a new set ! :)"
3,It's good but....,"Like any series, it starts to get old and some of the content is repetious. I really liked it when it first came out but it is like anything else, all good things seem to come to an end."
4,SAMCRO Slippin,"It was alright but not as good as the first two maybe three, seasons. A lot of chasing Abel all over Ireland. Jax does ascend to President. However, Clay should have been killed. Clay not dying has officially made this show ""jump the shark."" Forced to buy this as Netflix does not have season 4 even though it is out on DVD/BR at a price higher than here."
5,Turbulent season!,"This season was a tough one, and amazingly continued the story archs that we all know and love. Motorcylces, battles, brawls, cartels, betrayal, family, love, loyalty. A must-see series. Period."
5,Off Da Chain!,Sons of Anarchy keeps you at the edge of your seat. I watched all 4 seasons in about 4 days. A must see if you like eye popping action and a lot of drama.
4,Good segway...lots of questions,"As far as season finales go I was left wanting more but it seemed only appropriate for the next (final?) season. Yes, I would have loved to see Clay shredded by Jax but I'm sure he will get his next season. This season was great."
3,Disapointed.....,"The show itself is a 5, this episode is at best a 3. There's a problem with your finale if previous shows during the season surpassed it, easily. So many story lines that were built up all year, were tore down in seconds. Made it feel like a waste of time.Kurt Sutter said there may by a 6th or even 7th season. I can only imagine how they are going to drag this one out if that's the case. I like Sons of Anarchy, but how much longer can you drag this stuff out? Like anything, money comes before the story. They don't want to give away all of there story lines when they can still get 2+ more seasons of it.Season 3 was OK, and the finale saved it. Season 4 was GREAT and the finale diminished it in my eyes. I don't know which is worse. All I know is I'll be back in Charming next year, because it still is one of the best shows on television."
5,Best Season,I believe this is the best season in the SoA series. I would recommend purchasing these episodes to any SoA fan.
5,amazing,"Can stop.watching it, I often wish I was running with the SOA lol great show I can not wait to start watching season 5"
5,Great show,"Great show, great characters, great soundtrack and never a dull moment. Recommend for anyone who liked the Soprano's or similar type shows."
5,Always a winner,"I absolutely Love this series, it never disappoints. Recommend to all. Gets better with each episode. This season keeps it going"
3,Video quality,The viewing quality is sub standard and very pixalated on a large flat LCD screen. I would not recomend buying a video until this issue is resolved
2,Who are the good guys?,"There aren't any good guys, the ""sons of anarchy"" are a criminal organization, somehow I guess we're suppose to see how they're ""human"", but they're just thugs and I don't like them. They all ride harleys, have lots of tatoos, don't have jobs, and they sell guns to pay the bills and murder people to prove a point. But they don't like anyone selling crank in their town, so they have a good side. I can't understand all the positive reviews on this terrible show."
1,dvd order,Arrived very quickly...but the 2nd dvd was unwatchable ..upon inspection it was very scratched and I could not watch the middle of season4.
3,Season 4 download,"Awesome video quality, my only problem was that it doesn't have CC (Closed Captions) I'm hearing impaired and am always bummed to get a movie or TV show that doesn't provide captions."
5,Sons of Anarchy,"Love this DVD, I own all four seasons and can not get enough of the show. I would recomend it to those with a wild side to them."
5,Season 4 SOA,This is my favorite show of all times and I watch it all the time. I love Sons of Anarchy.
5,SOA ROCKS!,SOA comes back with a vengance this season. One episode in and it's already full of everything I love about this show. I cannot wait to see the next episode and where this season takes the MC and its members.
5,To Be or Not,"The writers never cease to amaze me! A tangled web of Freudian and warrior codes of loyalty. This episode kept me on the edge of my seat! Jax now has the ultimate decision to make between the women and the club. I suspect Jax will shake off the citizen mentality and remember that even though Gema and Tara are the two most important females in his life, they are, after all, ""just ole ladies"". I don't expect that this season will tie up all the lose ends and I don't believe that Clay will leave the show. Gema will not allow her dysfunctional ""family"" to seperate. Looking forward to next week!"
5,Sons of America,Great show as it evolves from season to season. The character development and change in relationships. Looking forward to Season 5 and 6.

2,Broke after 2 months,"I used this once a day, every day for 2 months to crush 1.5 trays of ice cubes. Worked great at first. Quieter than I expected based on other reviews. After a week, crushing took a lot longer. I believe the blades dulled quickly. You need to hold the crusher while in action. It thrashes the ice around violently and can work itself off the counter if not held down. If seldom used, it might be more practical, but for steady use, it is pretty lame. Cheaply built. Wears out fast."
2,Not your best choice,"I have had this ice crusher for about 8 months. I am not impressed. It puts out rather course ice chips even if I use the ice machine in my refridgerator first to break down the cubes. The underpowered motor often stops if you feed the machine even a little bit fast with chipped ice. The design is nice and it is quite easy to use, but this does not do you much good if it jams and gives you rather poor crushed ice. You can only make enough ice for about 1 drink, so it is not good for a birthday party etc with more than 3-4 people. It appears to me that you can get a better unit for less money or you can get a really good crusher/shaver for another 25 to 75 bucks.BTW: I still use mine because it was a gift. But I will soon replace it..."
1,"Why, oh why, can't I just give it 0 stars?","Three words:Worst.Book.Ever.How about fetishes from the viewpoint of a kink-phobic, vanilla sex ""therapist"" who thinks that everyone who does anything more than a little slap and tickle is proof of a serious mental imbalance? Or that heavy kink always replaces ""real"" sex (ie, intercourse)? Or that nobody involved in kink is a well-developed individual? Or that TS women are okay to sit and do makeup and chatter with, ""but I wouldn't sleep with one"" (her words, not mine!)And objectivity just flew out the door.I couldn't even read this piece of tripe all the way through. It's that bad. And I usually try and at least finish books before I review them. Needless to say, this book is one to avoid like the plague."
5,I DID IT!,"I did it! I used Mr. Poynter's book as my bible to self-publishing and I am now a published author. After a year of sending out over 300 query letters and sample text to agents and publishers, I decided that I'd had enough. So I saved some money and began the process of publishing my own book. On March 11th, I sent off for my ISBN, and on July 28th - I was a published author! Once I received my numbers, it took four months to the day of publishing the first book, yes first. The second is due out this fall, and the third - next summer.You can shave a lot of money off of the expenses by doing the work yourself. It was a bit scary at first (ie: building a website myself and typesetting myself), but after the first page, I was an expert. (See the novel ""Crossing Burning Bridges"" sold on this website or my website.) Since I am not able to leave the URL - search the title with yahoo and come see for yourself what you too can do.You can't self-pub without this manual!"
5,This Book Keeps Getting Better!,"Dan Poynter just keeps making this book better and better. In the ever changing field of publishing, Dan adds years of expertise and a store house of knowledge. As a book publisher who started out self-publishing, I must say that Dan's book is a must have for the rookie. The road to publishing is fraught with lots of glitches along the way. But using Dan's book, you can skip merrily over the throng of obstacles in your way. This jam-packed volume of over 500 pages is filled with great URLs for references, over 40 pages of resources in the Appendix and is backed up by a professional in the field that knows what he's about. Hat's off to Dan for this terrific new 12th edition! Linda Chestney President/Publisher Nicolin Fields Publishing, Inc. New Hampshire"
1,Save Your Money,"I could've saved my money and dug around on the Internet, for all this book was worth. It just lists a bunch of websites and resources that might be helpful. The book itself didn't help me at all. Your best bet is to see if it's available at a local library. Other than that, don't buy it."
3,Why not packing all necessary information in one real manual,Have some good materials and a lot of useless common knowledge. Many important information is referred to other books. It seems you have to buy his over twenty books on this narrow topic.Try to find another real manual which can keep it simple and complete!
4,"fast shipping, good basic book, ty!","shipping was as advertised, good seller communications. book good, a wee bit outdated but ok for a start to get an overview and some relevant updated info. good transaction, ty!"

5,Easy-to-Follow Blueprint For Self-Publishers,"We used earlier editions of Poynter's book as a guide to self-publishing two books and found his approach and suggestions work. This book contains almost everything you need to know to write, print and sell your book."
5,Self -Publishing Manual,"Excellent book the information is great, if you want a book to help you with information that you were not aware of, this is the book. I now know what I should do to start self-publishing my book and my daughter's books."
4,Good basic info!,"Buy a highlighter when you buy this book - lots of good, practical info. I am a first-time author, and I feel much more confident about the process after reading this book."
5,excellent book,this book is very well written and full of good information for any aspiring author. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Remarkable Resource,I used Dan Poynter's Self-Publishing Manual as a guide when I self-published my parenting/healthcare book entitled A Gift for Life: A Complete Record of Your Child's Health History (www.kadonpublishing.com). Poynter's manual is straight forward and very user friendly. I was able to independently produce a quality product without wasting a lot of valuable time.
5,Absolutely Essential Resource!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the Self-Publishing Manual. Dan Poynter's book is on the short list of desk books for anyone writing a book.

5,Wish I had not waited so long to purchase...,"My adult daughter referred me to this book six months ago, when I was close to publishing my first book. I only purchased it recently, but oh how I wish I had done so at the moment of her recommendation. It is an invaluable resource of information, practical references and insight into the publishing and marketing responsibilities of the author. After reading 1 chapter, I knew I had found THE resource I needed."
5,The Bible of Self-Publishing,I have used this book for my most recent book the Zen of Watering Your Garden and for the previous eleven medical books I have written and self-published. I consider it the single most useful book for self-publishing
3,Advice from 30 Years Ago on Starting a Publishing Company,"This book has two serious limitations:1. It was originally published in 1979, and the advice is for the publishing industry as it existed 30 years ago. It describes the old-style way of doing things. The author has a ""Volume II"" that purports to update to the electronic age, but it does not succeed. (I reviewed that book as well - I returned it.)2. Poynter's ""Self-Publishing Manual"" is not about ""self-publishing"" in the sense the word is used today. It's about starting your own publishing company, your own small independent press. Today there are other options for self-publishing and these are not covered at all.I didn't return this book because it's interesting to read how the publishing industry works, and that understanding can inform an overall strategy. But this book alone does not give you what you need to know about self-publishing in 2009."
5,Fantastic reference,What a font of information! I am following Poynter's advice to the letter and the entire process is moving along nicely. Tremendous lists in the Appendix that make research a lot easier. If you are publishing one and only one book or making it a career this is must have!
4,Very satisified customer,The product arrived on time and in good quality. The transaction was handled extremely well and I would not hesitate to order other products in the future.
5,praise for Poynter,This is a very helpful book for anyone intrested in self publishing. Get it. .............I said GET IT!!!!!!!
5,"If you plan on writing, this is THE book to get --PERIOD!","As a very busy professional speaker, author and columnist I simply don't have the time to research a dozens of books to get the information I want. Dan book is the definitive resource for self-publishing. You simply won't have to go anywhere else because it is all there, in an easy to read and implement format. Do yourself a favor, spend your time writing, not researching how to publish --Dan Poynter's book takes care of that part superbly!"
2,All Over the Place,"There is some good information in this book but who wants to read it? The author talks like he's talking to a friend who understands the publishing language. I don't know about publishing but I'm more confused now than I was before I started. The book is all over the place. For someone who considers himself the expert, he really needs to understand how learning works. I don't learn if you assume that I already know what you're thinking."
5,The Self Publishing Manual: How to Write and Sell Your Own Book,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!I read this book in two days nd I'm well on my way. Thanks for the info on how and whatto do and what not to do.
5,Worth 5x the cover price!,"If you tore this 450-page book into five sections, each section would be worth the full price.Dan Poynter has jammed useful advice into each and every page and covers everything from writing your book, creating the front and back cover, how to get it into bookstores, promote it, ship it. He also has links to more detailed articles published as PDF's on his website.Not only does he explain what you need to do, he includes URL's and contact phone numbers. He talks about what NOT to do, some of the downsides of self-publishing (returns, scammers) and how to respond to them, and even what life is like after you become a published author. I was amazed how generous Dan was with all his advice. The book is comprehensive and detailed and you will be referencing it over and over again."
2,Disappointed -- this book is self-serving,"Dan Poynter proclaims, ""Writing a book is easy!""I've been a writer and editor for 26 years, and I've written two books. I'm here to tell you that it is easy, indeed, to write a crummy book. It is most difficult to write a highly regarded book.Poynter also proclaims, ""The prestige enjoyed by the published book author is unparalleled in our society,"" and other similarly specious raves about the power of authorship. Of course he exaggerates: he is a consultant to self-publishing authors. This book is an advertisement for his services, and he doesn't hesitate to refer readers to the order forms at the back of the book.Much of his advice is simply wrong-headed.I read a couple other books for self-publishing authors, and Poynter's is easily the weakest. I can't understand why other readers gave him high ratings. Maybe they don't have much experience in publishing."
1,no useful information in this book,"This book gives you two introductory sentences for a topic and whenever it should come to the heart of the matter, it refers you to a website, usually Dan Poynter's own website. Once you go there, you are referred back to the book, at least as far as free content on the website is concerned or you have to pay to get more information, so you are back at the beginning and none the wiser. In short you are left with nothing except the annoyance of having spend money on a book that is totally useless. The one thing it is so, is a perfect example of self-promotion and hype over nothing.Of all the books I have read about this topic, Dan Poynter's books have been the most useless."
2,"This book isn't really for the ""writer"" in us . . .","I expected some key steps for the auther, especially a new author, to follow, once he/she has chosen to self publish. Instead this book is a manual on ""publishing"": the pre-print and print cycles of the standard print production cycle. As a practioner of advertising and promotion for over 40 years, I probably published thousands of publications: annual reports; data sheets; brochures. The process I knew; the insights as it related to the world of publishing fiction I did not.If you are ignorant of the steps in the publishing process (novel, neighborhood flyer, brochure) and really want to know, this book can give you an idea of how it is done. It's an easy read for the layman, clear, and straightforward."
2,Sales Ad for other books and reports.,"This book had all the basic self-publishing information. However, I felt like if I wanted the real important information I would have to purchase it from one the many books and reports that he advertising in this book. Information was dangled but never delivered."
5,Sudden - awesome western novels - almost inspirational!,"I think it is really sad that the publishers have decided not to publish this otherwise PERFECT series of novels ... only because of a misplaced sense of political correctness. Sudden novels are still available in India and there are a great many fans of this phenomenon, who goes under the nym of James Green, on the lookout for his father's killers. The reason, I have gathered, that this series is not being published is because of Sudden's horse's name - the N* word that is taboo in the US. Quite hypocritical, in my opinion, considering that people are not supposed to use certain words, 'irregardless' of the way they treat people. I sincerely hope the books are brought back into print - simply change the name of the horse! Why not?!"
5,SUDDEN is the best,What can I say about SUDDEN series? They are certainly not only best in their class but also perhaps some of the best books ever written. I was so crazy about SUDDEN books that I am still called SUDDEN by my friends. I have been trying to get the whole series for the last 5 years but .......
5,"A really good read, worth keeping in your collection.","I started reading Sudden in the early '70's. The whole Sudden series was very enjoyable, and I still have a few with me. I have been searching for the whole series, 'cause I want to give them to my son. Hope I'll be able to find these books through Amazon."
4,FREDERICK'S OK BUT OLIVER'S THE KING,"hi my name is andy bown ,bin reading sudden again and again for last 20 years every time i get bored or am ill. olivers the best western writer ever and that goes.END"
5,"Should be made into TV epic drama,AWESOME!","This was a gripping novel which led you shadowing the heroin on a trail-blazing adventure to the new frontier of California. You could nearly feel the searing, intense burn of her skin as her poison-arrow wound was cauterized in the primitive branding fashion after her wagon train was attacked by the native Diggers. You could nearly smell the flesh burning. Second only to Gone With The Wind."
4,An excellent read from from a classic author,"Very good book from a classic author. Not quite as satisfying as Calico Palace or Celia Garth, but still very enjoyable."
5,the jubilee trail,Read the jubilee trail in the late 60's as a 7th grader...it was my mama's book....all my life I have remembered it and wished I had her copy....just tonight I thot I would just see what I could find on the Internet regarding it....I am so excited....going to get jubilee trail as well as other books by bristow....what an awesome memory of an awesome writer!!!Jubilee Trail (Rediscovered Classics)
4,"Jubilee Trail, A Wonderful Memory, A Must Read","It has been a long time since I have read Jubilee Trail and let me say I read all the books in the series and loved this book. Like one of the reviewers above my first discovery of this book was the public library, as years have pass on, I have bought the book and re-read in numerous times. I would love to give it five stars but it probably is not worthy of five stars compared to so many other books that have been written since. This first book was made into a movie, probably in the 1950-60's and repeats every once in awhile on television. I am pretty sure it goes by the same title and maybe there is a DVD. These characters will hook you in and you will care about them, their flaws-their good deeds. I think I am going to have to look for my copy or re-order this book, it is one book I have never forgotten for over 45 years! To be honest I can still remember where it was shelved in the library."
2,Jubilee Trail,"I found Jubilee Trail interesting and have a better picture of the way life must have been for pioneers making their way to California. However, I found the depth of characters and the story to be somewhat juvenile. This book would be better suited to a young teenager who has an interest in historical fiction, not a mature adult."
4,Not as good as Calico Palace,"Good book, but I liked Calico Palace much better. Jubilee Trail is just a little to predictable."
3,Good item. However we never received the Free AC Adapter,We never received the Free AC Adapter. I have sent several emails to Amazon with no response.
1,"Bad, really","I bought this unit from other store(silver). Amazon sells this unit with battery(I dont know exactly), but the unit I bought was with AC adapter. Anyway, After using a few times, this was not working properly. Evenif I didn't load anything on the scale, the number is not ""0""(I tired to set ""0"" but kept moving). It keeps moving from -50g to +50g. This is not stable."
4,digital scale,Item arrived promptly but did not contain the bonus free ac adapter as promised. Since it could run on batteries and was on sale for 19 bucks I didn't say anything until i was asked to review. At that point I said i would be happy to review if i got the adapter. They were right on it and within 4 days i got the adapter sent UPS to my door. Shipping for the adapter alone must have wiped out any profit s these guys were making. They stood by their product and when there was a mistake they rectified it immediately no questions asked. Quite impressive. Oh and the scale works well too
5,GREAT!!!,"I always wanted a Dyson but didn't want to spend the money. Great product for a great price. Remanufactured, yes, but looks and works like new. Well worth it. Tools snap on for storage. Canister is easy to remove and empty. Nice design, easy to manuver and not heavy. Shipping was free and super fast!"
4,Dyson Vacuum,"Works very well. The hose is a little awkward but you get the hang of it after a while. Too many attachments to figure out. Nice to have but not essential. Overall, pleased with my purchase. I expect to have this vacuum for a long time."
1,Never got to use vacuum,"I ordered this vacuum from totalvac and on the page there it is advertised to come with the mini turbine head, bare floor tool, extra filter, and 10 yr warranty. It doesn't come with any and they are impossible to deal with or get ahold of. The first one was broken and missing parts and we sent it back and spoke to the lady in returns and told her the problem, so we received the 2nd one and once again missing everything. We will be sending this back for a refund and buy one from somewhere else. Be careful what you buy from this company, they have false advertisement."
4,Light and powerful,"We saw the commercials. We looked at our carpets. We bought the Dyson. The primarily reason was its claims of being a good solution for pet hair and its ability to not get clogged. We were certainly tired of taking apart our previous vacuum to clear out clogs, so we were sold. We have two dogs who love to shed. And the Dyson does a wonderful job of cleaning up behind them - with very little hassle. It's super quiet, and its suction power is amazing. It's very quiet and the hose is plenty long for the stairway and strong enough to avoid tears. And it is certainly the lightest upright vacuum we've owned. It's easy to clean seeing as it is a bagless unit, and it's filter mechanism keeps dust from spraying everywhere when you clean up finer dirt or powders.We only dock it a star (we'd prefer a half star) because some of its components are a little weak and have broken on our unit - e.g., the power cord hook.Overall, it is an awesome vacuum and well worth the investment."
4,Great vacuum,"We love this Dyson. It seems to make the whole house, including the air, cleaner. Performance wise or visually, we cannot tell that this vacuum has been re-manufactured. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c it was sent to us with the wrong user's manual. Because of that, we thought we had been sent the wrong set of filters. We went through some unnecessary hassle b/c of that. We finally learned that the user's manual can be downloaded off of [...]."
2,returned to amazon,"I gave it 3 stars because I'm not sure if it's just my bad luck to receiving a bad ""refurbished"" unit. The unit makes loud grinding noise and I don't have high carpets, they're more like short area rugs.I had called Dyson twice regarding the issue. Contrary to what others said about their customer service, I had pretty good experience with the dyson customer service. But the problem still persist and I ended up returning the unit to Amazon."
5,Refurb Dyson,"So far this vacuum is great. Even tho it is, I'd really been disappointed to pay $400. for this new from a store. Half price is the greatest! I didn't go for the extended warranty since it wasn't from Dyson."
5,Great buy! Definitely grateful I got it,"Came in a brown unmarked box will all accessories and sealed documentation including a new replacement filter. It has a 6-month factory warranty and technical support. Like other reviewers have said, the assembly instructions aren't that good but after a few minutes the vacuum was up and running. It only came with one slight scratch near the brush area (which will get scratched later on anyways) so I didn't mind.Its definitely powerful, not heavy as it looks and easy to work around furniture. For small spaces the included powered brush is great.Definitely consider this vacuum, for the functionality, warranty and more importantly, price. Saved over 50% over a new one."
5,Dyson Rocks!,"My husband is in love with our new (well, remanufactured) Dyson vacuum! I've never seen a man vacuum so often. I am truly amazed. AND the vacuum really does work like a dream, even with our frequent home improvement projects and family dog dirtying up the house. Our friends our jealous. :)"
5,Awesome vacuum!!!,"Received it a week ago and have used it several times extensively throughout the house putting it through it's paces (carpets, drapes, furniture, and dryer vent) and found it to be the best vacuum I have ever owned. I let my four year old use (play with) it and it actually sucked up a small rubber baseball, so I was very impressed with the force of suction it had. Took some time to acclimate myself to the wand being always attached; but found it very easy and useful to use once I realized how it exactly worked. All-in-all, i am very happy with the product; but would have had a hard time paying full manufacturer price for a new unit. Would recommend a refurbed one of these anytime!"
5,Can't beat it for the money,For $220 on a Friday sale so far it runs and looks like new...only had it for a month or so though. We have tile floors and low shag carpet and it works fine for these. The attachments and wand take some getting used to but work well.
5,Never been a better vaccume,These have got to be the best around. Never had a problem with a refurbed unit. Have bought three now for various family memebers and all rave about how clean your carpet gets. Try this before replacing your carpet.
5,"yes, absolutely","After all my hesitation, I jumped in and committed to the Dyson full-kit. I have two German Shepherds, a Pug, and two sons in my two-bedroom bungalow. I have not been this in love with an appliance since I bought my front-loading wash machine.My floor is bare-foot, squeaky clean. Don't hesitate to consider a factory refurbished model, as I got a great price for a vacuum in perfect condition. Dyson made vacuuming a high-order, exacting experience. So quiet. So perfect. Make your vacuum obsolete and commit to a Dyson. It's a lifestyle change, and I say that in spite of the fact it's super-retro pathetic to wax poetic about an appliance."
2,Maybe #2 will be the charm.,"The Dyson Vacum when it worked was wonderful. I love all the features, it picks up great. Sometimes its hard to push on certain types of carpets because while it automatically adjust, it would be better to be able to manually adjust. The reason i gave this one such a low rating was because in the end I returned it, it kept shutting off due to over heating."
5,This Vacuum is pure love.,"I have never liked a domestic machine more than this. Our daughter has severe allergies and after going through several vacuum cleaners this is the first we've used that IS'NT followed by a sneezing/wheezing fit. It's easy to empty, though it's a bit heavy to push. I like that the stair attachment can reach up to the landing without having to haul the entire thing up each single stair."
3,IMPENETRABLE,"I've really made a huge effort to try to appreciate Tilt, without success, alas! Walker has a very distinctive voice, but I find this particular aesthetic to be completely impenetrable. I am giving it 3 stars because it's obviously a well-conceived work of art, but I derive no enjoyment from listening to it. In fact, it induces a feeling of claustrophobia. Very bleak, lugubrious music and the obscure lyrics don't help either. Comparisons are difficult, but perhaps John Cale's ""Music For A New Society"" is similar in its uncompromising desolation and despair. These pieces at times serve as a good vehicle for Walker's voice, but purely on a sonic level as the lyrics convey no concrete meaning to me except a sense of unease and suffocation. I'm tempted to describe it as chamber music from hell, but perhaps instead it is a bizarre new direction in classical experimentalism."
1,If only there were a 0 star rating...,"One word: garbage. This stuff reminds me of a spoof Will Ferrell did on Saturday Night Live a while back about some lame singer (Robert Goulet). Same voice here for this so-called singer except it apparently was not intended as a joke. I'd rather listen to the screeching sound of nails on a chalk board than this, thank you..."
1,I must be missing something!,"This is a dark brooding inaccessible album, definitely not easy-listening. But frankly, despite all the ""best album you've never heard of"" hype it receives from fans, I couldn't get anything out of it. It left me completely cold. The vocal is unusual but not likable."
3,hard going,"strange and quite pained album , something that may bring on depressive bouts for anyone feeling down .... i like his songs on Nite Flights (the opening 4 tracks) , the rest of that album sounded so very dated like so many other pub disco bands ... despite the pedigree , i cannot find anything in this album to recommend it (and i went searching for it) ... i really think it belongs to members of the art set to discuss over a martini or those looking for a very low key minimalist soundscape , perhaps it may be good background music for an installation in the middle of a desert , sad and a little scary......... maybe i missed the point or maybe it has no point"
5,not completely inaccessible,"Since I bought this CD last week, I've read lots of reviews to see what others have thought of it, and am surprised to hear how 'unconventional and inaccessible' it is. I strongly recommend it to anyone who doesn't require completely cliched and repetitive song structure to feel comfortable. If you can follow the melodies of opera, and can handle the melancholy of bands like Dead Can Dance or Black Tape for a Blue Girl; then, like me, you've waited way too long to get this CD."
5,Whew! Out There!,"There doesn't seem to be any good way to really review this album. Its fascinating because it makes so little sense, but it feels right enough that we can tell its not a deliberate mess. There's a good chance that you just will not like it. It took me a few tries to really grasp it. The first few times I listened to it, I was hooked, just because it was so unlike anything I've heard before. Now that I've listented to it a dozen or so times, its pretty incredible. Amazingly good music to listen to at night."
4,Slightly stiff but well worth checking out,"This is one STRANGE CD. I admire Scott Walker's willingness (especially at his age) to take big chances with this very arty, uncompromsing music. It is a bit stiff which leaves it not totally engaging, thus, the four stars. However, anyone interested in truly original music should check this out. If you like The Divine Comedy or The Tindersticks, go to the orignal and you see how much these groups have followed his lead."
5,The best book I ever read.,When I bought this book I was thinking as a fans of Menudo. But now I feel a real respect about all their contribution to the hispanic music industry. Thanks to the author to give us this historical review about Menudo's life and for her objective comments. I recommend this book to Menudo and Ricky Martin's fans and for all the people who likes the showbusiness industry. You'll learn a lot about it. Thanks again and congratulations to the author.
5,Menuda Curiosidad,"No sé si agradecer a lo que sea por haber encontrado esta información sobre el libro, porque ignoro si algún día dicho libro lo tendré en mis manos. Por favor, ayúdenme a obtenerlo, cómo comprarlo o a quién encargárselo, preferiblemente sin necesidad de credit's card. De antemano, gracias.P.D. Soy admiradora de Ricky Meléndez desde que tenía cuatro(4)años de edad, así que si tienen algo sobre él, también me gustaría saberlo. Thanks. Y lamento no tener puntos de vista sobre el libro, pero NO LO TENGO."
1,Useless Plastic,"It's Plastic so the crappy L shape screws can easily stip. My eight foot tree fell over spilling water and wrecking all the decorations . Like the other review I thought maybe I didn't line the tree up right but when you watch it the screws were actually falling out because the threads on the base are thin and PLASTIC. Also I did'nt overtighten . I guess this stand would be good for a very small tree . They should put some sort of anchors (aluminum, or stainless)"
2,bad stand,"I got this stand from a major hardware store, but I'm sure it's the same stand. Unlike the cheap metal stands, which sometimes require some trimming of branches at the bottom to make the tree fit, this stand will hold just about any tree, which is great. However, it's hard to water the tree, the screws strip, and your tree will come crashing down. Get yourself a cheap metal stand."
1,8.5' tree came crashing down!,"6"" trunk, straight 8.5 ft tree came crashing down at 3:30AM thanks to this POS stand. The plastic cracked around one of the screw holes so we couldn't even set it back up temporarily. Our tree is leaning against the wall now and we'll be buying another stand today.While this stand looks like it would be rugged and hold a tree well, with 8 screws and a wide base, it does not. I'm just thankful that it happened over night and not while the kids were near the tree! What a mess of broken ornaments!"
3,Sturdy Stand,"We just set our tree up with this yesterday and so far so good. As another reviewer wrote, the spout for the water isn't very steep so you do have to pour carefully, but that isn't really a problem for us. As with any stand using screw-in bolt holders, it took a while to get the tree aligned and tightened down properly. Once set, the tree seems very stable and I think the 8 bolt design helps with that. Still, unless you spend $50 on one with a foot pedal or some kind of automatic system for tightening you'll have to manually align the tree, which is a tedious process.The ""Ultimate Christmas Tree Stand"" has a foot pedal and looks great on their company website, but it costs a lot more. So for now, the H2O tree stand is a keeper."
1,Worst Tree Stand Ever,"This stand is horrible. Our tree would not stay straight and kept leaning over after making adjustment after adjustment. This morning the tree just toppled over. Put it back up, readjusted everything again, within an hour it was crooked again, then shortly after that I heard a crash and there it was on the floor again, broken ornaments everywhere.Save your money and buy something much better than this piece of trash."
2,Reconditioned did not work,"I was so excited for the ""deal"" I got on this reconditioned Dyson, while the Amazon customer service to get it here was just fine, when I got it and put it together and went to do vaccum - it made a horrible screeching sound and the sucking tube came loose. Every time I set it down to vaccum, it did the same thing. I called Dyson direct, and they said that because it was reconditioned there was nothing they could do or say to help.I am in the process of sending it back, which seems relatively easy, but has not yet been picked up."
4,Disappointed,"The vacuum works wonderful, well worth the asking price - however, it was advertised as having a 2 year unconditional warranty. When it arrived, it had a note attached that stated that it had a limited 6 month warranty. I would purchase the vacuum again, but I will verify any advertised warranty information prior to purchase."
5,I LOVE MY DYSON!!,"I am a severe allergy sufferer who had to depend on my husband to clean. I have had two hepa filtered, bagless Hoover vacuums that threw dust into the air. I am done sneezing, coughing and and dealing with swollen eyes from my old vacuums. This Dyson has been all over our house(blinds, carpeting, laminate and linoleum)and I DID ALL THE CLEANING!! If you have allergies, or just have a need for clean, you need this vacuum!!"
1,This thing is very over rated!!!!,"""Never losses suction"" Good thing because it has less suction than most vacuums that are half plugged!!! Also the head is so high that you cannot reach under a kitchen cabinet. Yes, you could use that attachment but that is a real pain! I'll stick with Hoover and just change the bag once a month. Buyer beware!!!"
4,dyson vacuum,"I would give this vacuum a 4. The handle is a bit cumbersome to use, it takes a while to get used to. I also don't like that it does not have a light on it. But, it does do a great job at cleaning. It really has a lot of suction and picks up a lot of dirt. It is also easy to clean the bagless catch. I would buy it again."
2,dyson dc 14 all floors,"This is a wonderful vacuum. It picks up dirt better than any other vacuum I've owned on ceramic tile and hardwood floors. It does carpet perfectly as well. It is very lightweight in my opinion, much lighter than my Hoover wind tunnel. I am able to vacuum the entire length of my stairs now without lugging the vacuum halfway up with me because of the easy to use, extra long hose! It is very easy to empty the dirt canister and also very quiet! No more missed phone calls when cleaning. I would have rated it 5 stars but there are two things that I don't like about this vacuum. Because of the shape (height) of the ""nose"" of this vacuum, it does not fit under the toe kick area of kitchen and bathroom cabinets. This means that you have to use an attachment to clean under these areas. Also, I don't like the weird angle of the attachment that you would use to get into corners and edges. The angle makes it all but impossible to use."
5,"Wow, this thing works!","First off let me say that I've not had it long enough to talk reliability but it showed up in like new condition and it flat out works. Yes, it's not as slim as some and for the price you'd expect a auto wind cord and stuff but it picks up dirt and that's the main thing.My old bissel died as I moved into a new house with synthetic carpet and the thing just bogged and would pic up nothing. This Dyson picked up loads of those carpet fibers initally and now it's just dirt that it has to deal with. If I could find one I would want one of the old steel Electrolux vaccums like my mother and grandmother have but this is the closest in suction I've yet seen."
4,First was a dud - second was a keeper,"Don't be afraid to purchase Reconditioned. The first one came and it had little plastic pieces floating around the box. I logged on and in two minutes I had told Amazon what the problem was and asked for a new one. In two days a new one was at my door! I packaged up the broken one and off it went back. Shipping paid for and everything. The dyson works great, though I have to say I have it under glass and we all just sit there and gaze at how pretty it is and that it's finally ""home"" AHHHHH"
2,do not go for factory-reconditioned DC-14s,"In my past experience buying refurbished products, they're usually as good as new. Not in this case. The first DC14 I received came in damaged, with a very important clip broken and leaving the vacuum cover loose. Amazon replaced it in a couple weeks (i had to pay out of my own pocket to send the defective one back to amazon), but the 2nd one is worse. It is clearly used, scratches all over the plastic surface, accessories clips are broken out of the box, and the air coming out of the vacuum smelled funky... no suprise it's going back again. I don't know what else to say about this vacuum, but Dyson's factory reconditioning process should be called factory re-packing. Save yourself trouble and get a new one."
5,Factory-Reconditioned Dyson DC 14-Thumbs up!,I love my new Factory-Reconditioned Dyson DC 14. It's great.
3,"I just got one, but haven't used it.",I wonder why this DC 14 bagless type of Dyson vacuums sold in Amazon are ALL Factory-Reconditioned? I do doubt about its quality and have no idea whether I should keep it or return.
5,Works for the cat,"I have to give my cat an asthma pill so I grind it up and put the powder in some of this stuff, and she really goes for it. I save half a can in the fridge for the next dose a couple days later. Both the cat and I find this product quite workable.My veterinarian recommended this particular flavor because she finds cats always go for it."
3,Poor sound but worth a listen,"The sound is very muddy, but several of the tracks on this CD merit its purchase. The ""Crickets"" jam (split into the tracks ""Splattums"" and ""Hoppin"") is especially good. This is a novel approach to a live album: it catches most songs mid-jam, taking the music away from its organic development and serving it up in vignette form. To hear what the Biscuits really do sound like in concert (pre-early 2005, when the original drummer plans to leave the band), visit their Web site and purchase some concert downloads or the crystalline, perfect TranceFusionRadio CD series."
1,Extra Firm?,"The item arrived as ordered and was shipped quickly. my only gripe is that when I buy a name brand item I expect to receive the item as advertised.Maybe it is just me but this is not what I would call an ""extra firm support"" pillow. Nice. Comfortable. But in no way would I call this extra firm. But this is what happens when you shop for mattresses and pillows. We had to go to a specialty mattress store that actually sold what was advertised unlike the department stores that have supposed ""extra firm"" mattresses until you lie on one and sink in.If you want a nice pillow this is a good choice. If you want an extra firm support pillow go somewhere for a squeeze test as you may be disapointed."
2,Not good for us,"My husband and I are mainly side sleepers, sometimes back. We have been trying different pillows bc of back & neck pain, headaches, and my sinus issues. We got these at the mall during a great sale and thought they'd be great bc they're the same brand as our wonderful mattress.Unfortunately no matter how we tried sleeping on them they just werent comfortable and we would toss and turn, having to constantly readjust them. We've since tried a few more firm pillows that were varying levels of better. These were our least favorite and least supportive."
2,Firm Support Pillows,"These pillows are of very good quality, however, they are much fuller than other firm support pillows I own. They are so thick that it is hard to put my arms around it when I sleep on my side.They look nice on the bed though."
5,Soft and Supportive,"I was in the market for bed pillows that would be supportive but yet soft. Down pillows were out of the question because of allergies I get from them. A friend of mine told me about a pillows that is filled with hypoallergenic polyester. I started researching this kind of pillow and came across Sealy Posturepedic Essential Support pillows. They are Superstandard size, 28 by 20 inches, which does fit standard and queen pillow cases, which I had. I love this pillow because I've had restful night sleeps due to it's softness but yet supportive nature.It's a great buy!"
5,An exquisite artist of language,"Terry Marotta's use of words and language in this book is so exquisite that her phrases catapult you to familiar images. I found myself saying ""Yes, that is exactly what that looks like. Yes, I know that feeling exactly."" Her fine use of words paint pictures that were delightful. And her handling of everyday life and subjects was fun, at times funny, but always respectful. Having read this book, I am buying it as Christmas gifts for others who love the fine craft of words and I am getting a second of her works for myself!"
2,"Great detail, Lousy history","Gideon Welles once said that the Porters were all liars and braggarts. This massive volume by David Dixon Porter goes far to proving it. As history, it is lousy, heavily biased, and one-sided. However, for the serious historian, there is a great amount of administrative detail that cannot be found elsewhere. A good source, if its limitations are properly recognized."
4,Well Done Mystic Flight Games,"A well put together book of races, with each race having at least one racial prestige class. I have found the book useful and informative."
3,leaky bowl,"Delivery of our bowl was quick, which was great, but the performance of our bowl..not so. It leaked when flipped on its side even though we followed the directions exactly and never filled over the line. We do know other people who have and swear by this bowl, so maybe ours was just defective. Also, we thought that we were getting a black bowl like the one pictured, but ended up getting a grey bowl instead. The customer service people were helpful, fast and efficient and we would do business with them again."
4,Buddy Bowl,The bowl was purchased for my cocker spaniel to keep his ears from getting wet. It did prevent the ears from getting in the bowl and holds a great deal of water which is nice but it is very large (I keep the dishes in the kitchen). I considered sending it back due to the size but did not want to fool around with shipping costs.
4,"It does the job, but then over time the lid is hard to remove",This bowl really doesn't spill. You can put it upside down and no water comes out! The only downfall is it is hard to take the top off. But its worth it if you have a puppy who constantly plays with the water bowl.
2,Disapointing !,"Good as reference. Bad as explanatory.At the first time I saw this book over a colleague's desk I got very interested. Finally (I thought)I would get an ""easier"" approach to 3GPP standards and on understanding basic UMTS message flows !After buying the book and spending some time on it, I perceived that this book is, in truth, a joint of all processes described on 3GPP, without any relevant improvement on the sense of making UMTS' message flows easier to diggest... Nowadays I use it much more as a reference literature (to know where to learn - on the standards)."
3,"Great writing, extra fine print text.","I feel like I should be using a magnifying glass when I read this book, there are 3 columns on every page and the print is very small.It took away from the overall experience of the book."
4,how about 3 1/2 stars?,"This album is very good, but almost too good. It has the twang in the right place, pedal steel guitar at the right moment, acoustic strumming right when it should be. But it lacks SOUL. Almost like an album-by-numbers project. Its not bad, but not terribly original. I wasn't disappointed, but not overly impressed either."
2,Wierd,Following instructions got me no-where. I don't like these and don't use them. They are small enough that they are put in easily but getting them out is a tad uncomfortable. They don't just slip out when releasing your muscles.
1,Bad quality,"If you already know the Jovan Musk by Jovan 3.25oz with orange box and gold lid, this one is much more alcoholic and it smells like cheap perfum. Does not seem the same factory."
3,Two Mediocre TV Movies,"First of all, this DVD is two movies on one disc, not two discs, as advertised. Secondly, it is in Full Screen format, not Widescreen.The sound quality of this disc is very poor and uneven, especially on BIRD OF PREY. My hearing is not very good, and there are no closed captions. I was constantly turning the volume up and down -- up, so I could hear the dialogue, then down because the music was too loud. The setting was in Bulgaria, and the foreign accents made it even harder to understand. (In places where the dialogue was in Bulgarian, they did at least have the translation in English subtitles).BUMP IN THE NIGHT was much better in sound quality, although there were still no closed captions. The acting was quite good, especially Meredith Baxter-Birney, who played an alcoholic whose son was kidnapped."
3,Could do better,"Classic Secret Affairs tracks make this album just about ok...Merton Parkas song are probably the best they did with Mick Talbot being a class act no matter who he plays with. Beggars never really made it big and these tracks are more to fill up an album to capitalize on the mini mod revival we've gone thru in the last couple of years....While a little more expensive, I'd probably stick with buying the Secret Affair/Time for Action and treat yourself to the Complete Collection for the Parkas....if you are feeling really nostalgic, pick up the Lambrettas.....steer clear of this one unless you only have 15 bucks to spend...."
3,Rough and Ready for Action,If anything cpatures the mod revival of the late 1970s early 1980s this is it. Not the best sound recording and not the best artists but for sheer power and entusiasm this CD has it. A necessary item in any Mods collection.
4,price? is that right,my review is only this phillips direct sells this tv for under 700.00 so whats up with the price at amazon.com at over 750.00model 30pw9100d/37....also hard to rate a product i haven't seen yet. based on what this tv has to offer the price range is 4 stars
1,Didn't do a thing.,"My Jack Russell has pretty bad allergies and I've tried everything to get her to stop itching and biting. This is one of the many products I tried that did not work at all. Also, I'm not sure if I should admit this, but I ran out a cortisone for me when I had just bought this, so of course I got a bug bite that itched like crazy. I decided to try this and see if it worked. It felt like I might as well have sprayed water on it. Nothing. That's when I tossed it in the trash. This stuff is worthless."
4,hazy crazy,"""Be Safe with Me"" is like an echo of a recent failed relationship, so maybe I'm just in a tender spot where self-reflective music seems sung directly to me. That being said, this is one of the best things I've heard in a long time. I first heard Cynthia Dall on one of the Kill Rock Stars compilations and played the song over and over. This is different. Where ""Eric's Song"" was acoustic, SRYM is primarily loose, fuzzy electric guitars, slow, drawn out compositions, and bewitching voice. I like it and highly recommend it."
5,This should be the first Stein book in any collection!,"At last this book is back in print! Using Stein's words and pictures of her, her contemporaries and the places that were the backdrops of their lives, Renate Stendhal has created one of the most vital picture-bios of Stein and her era. The introductory essays at the beginning of each chapter set the stage for what follows, giving the reader a clear chronology and context. The excerpts from Stein's works are helpful in determining which of Stein's works(many of which are still in print) you'll want to read next. Everyone who was anyone in their crowd is here. A great gift for anyone interested in the literary/artistic period between WWI and WWII."
1,don't believe it,I can't help but believe that all the positive reviews for this item are fakes written by BioCare. This is a piece of junk. Just get the flea drops - they're the only thing that seems to work in my house.
3,Works,Works only half as advertised. Trips the little critters in their steps but doesn't draw them in as it says.
1,why bother,Save your money for the exterminator. I did Frontline and Capstar to move the fleas off the cats snd the fleas would still don't bother with these traps.
1,DO NOT BUY,This trap did not catch a single flea. I believe the company wrote all those postive reviews.
2,waste of money,Bought this and tried it in every single room. The only thing this thing caught was cat hair and dirt. Only good use I get out of it is that it makes a great nightlight.
4,springstar flea trap,Have used other flea traps for years. The springstar has a plastic grating over the sticky pad which prevents animals and other things from getting stuck on the pad. I'm very pleased.
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought two traps in an effort to gauge the severity of my flea problem. The traps were placed in dark rooms near the areas most frequented (sleeping area and napping area) by my dog. After several nights of operation I found a single flea in the trap near the dog's bed. During that same period both my dog and I were bitten many, many times. Under no circumstances should this product be considered any form of treatment for a flea problem. Based on my experience if there are sufficient fleas to be caught in this trap the area is probably uninhabitable."
3,ok product,We purchased 5 of these traps for each of our rooms after a flea infestation from a stray we took in. I also treated our animals and bought another product containing boric or the carpets which took care of most of our problem. Honestly i wish we would not have bought these and saved the money the traps only got maybe 2 fleas in each one and the other product took care of the infestation this product is more like a back up just to catch a few extra stragglers it seems. You need to keep off all the lights at night for the to work at all from what i understand. like i said this is a backup product.
2,An expensive night light,I had a flea problem in my house and worked hard at getting it under control. Getting 2 flea traps was one of the measures I took. I have still found some fleas on the dog but there are more gnats than fleas in the trap. I would not purchase this again. It makes an expensive night light - that's about the only thing it's good for now.
1,Doesn't work,I've been using 2 of these products for 5 days now. I've yet to catch any fleas with it and my dog still is getting them. I turn off every source of light and put it in the middle of the room. I don't know what is wrong with it? I've even put it on the couch and in the bed. We have black out shades in our bedroom so I run it all day. Nothing. I am not quite understanding why it has the grill over the sticky pad. Maybe I'll take it off and see how it works.
1,Didn't work at all,"I placed the flea trap exactly how the instructions suggested. Nothing. So, I moved it to another high activity flea area. Nothing. The only thing that this trap caught was dust. This item is simply a piece of sticky paper with a light bulb. Fleas have no interest in it."
1,don't waste your money,"I bought this based on some good reviews. Either my flea problem is not that bad, or I am not finding the right place to put this item. I have put it on the couch, under the couch, in my pets beds and in my bedroom and I have only caught 2 fleas. I put out a bowl of soapy water with a light over it and I have caught 100% more than with this item. While it may work for some, it unfortunately it did not work for me."
1,I did the Pepsi Challenge,"There are two flea traps of about the same price, so I bought them both and stacked them up against each other. The other is the Victor M230 Ultimate Flea Trap. This product is worthless. I placed the two traps next to each other in multiple rooms around my house, switching them from side to side to be sure it wasn't location. I would check them daily. The Victor would have 4 or 5 fleas daily. This detained fleas for a while until they escaped. Never once did the Springstar have more than one, and usually nothing. I could watch them pop out. The Victor is far from perfect, but is way better than this. Absolute utter waste of money."
1,Flea trap-which one is best......,"Springster is Definately not as good as the Victor m30 flea trap.. Got them both to see which would work better & Victor flea trap definately won my vote. Victor also comes with an extra sticky to trap those suckers when the first one fills up, Springster doesn't..."
3,Good stuff but needed more help,Worked well but still had to use chemicals sprayed on floor to get rid of infestation--Also bought different one that plugged into wall outlet (Enforcer) that did not work nearly as well because fleas were unable to reach it except at bottom and one light stopped working after about 1 month but problem fixed by then
1,Doesn't work,I bought this because I didn't want to use chemicals. We have little kids and lots of fleas. This thing was on 24/7 for weeks in multiple locations that have fleas. Not a single flea was caught. Total waste. This is a safe flea trap all right -- safe for the fleas!
2,Why it didn't catch any?,"I bought this trap with another Ultimate Flea Trap at the same time. However, the Ultimate Flea Trap catch almost 20 fleas while this trap didn't catch anything."
2,doesn't attract enough fleas to make a diffrence in infestation,"the trap does collect fleas over time but not enough of them to make any difference compared to a severity of infestation in your house. looks like only some of few fleas choose to jump into the trap, the majority of the rest hide and breed in other spots and stay on your pets.so there is no purpose of buying it if it doesn't help with much result"
1,Can only catch Dust,"I guess this only works if you have carpet. It attracted dust, I have no carpeting so it was not very useful. I did move it to a couch and got a total of 2 fleas. It was kind of a waist."
2,Wouldn't buy it again,"The only reason this product caught a flea was because I picked one off my white sock and threw it on there. I did see a flea that had jumped on the trap, but it landed on top of the screen and jumped back off. I thought I'd be smart and remove the screen, but all I caught was my kitten's very fluffy tail as she must have sat down close to it and waved her tail over it. It took two of us to get it off her because THEN it decided to be sticky!! Pass on this."
2,springstar s102,"Springstar s102 flea trap ,,,After a week I'Ve yet to see any results. My cat has fleas up a storm."
4,At first we weren't sure...,"After we were late with the 2nd round of herbal topical flea treatments;that's when we were sure they worked. I'm not sure how far ranging it pulls fleas in from, or I'd rate it higher. A through vaccum did a world of good, but it needs repeating as well, so this really acts as another layer of attack.Can't stand the permanent ""night-light"" though...grr. I hate fleas more though."
3,Never caught any fleas on it,"Cats had fleas because one was adopted with them. None were caught on this trap. According to the vet the best way to get rid of fleas is daily vacuuming, and flea treatment for the cats (there is a pill as well as frontline, one is fast acting, the other longer lasting). Hate to put those chemicals on the cats but once in a lifetime isn't too bad I guess. After that fleas were gone. It was also a good excuse to finally rip up my carpeting and install wood floors.The product itself is just a sticky tray and a nightlight. It seemed like the fleas went everywhere except on the trap!"
1,caught by mistake?,Used it for about 3 weeks. Tried all different spots. It caught 3 fleas. I feel like maybe the cat just walked over it and one fell off haha. Either way I don't think 3 fleas is very effective or worth the money. Disappointing. But fast shipping!
3,Peace of mind,We moved into a house that had to be treated for fleas.I didn't want my cats to get them...so I bought this for peace of mind.I plugged it in and only ended up getting a few tiny fleas...but I thought better the trap than anything!
1,Save Your Money,"I am shocked to read any of the positive reviews on this product. The ""trap"" only had two fleas in the month that I used it; and they must have committed suicide. A complete waste of money!"
4,Quite Satisfactory,"Once I figured out I had to remove the paper backing from the flypaper for it to work, it really started snagging fleas."
4,One died in a month - not a flea - the unit,"I bought 5 of these due to a flea infestation. 2 placed into service July 13, 2011. Of those two, one is still working (light is burning), but the other is a goner. New bulb won't work, nor will plugging it into another outlet. 4 are doing their job. They also trap small roaches and spiders, and maybe gnats as well as fleas. Mainly they give you reassurance that the flea population is kept under control.One nuisance feature is pulling the cover off the sticky paper - hard to do and your fingers get sticky as well. Vegetable oil removes the stickum from hands however.I would give this product 5 stars, except for the short-lived unit.I am also treating my cat frequently with Capstar (kills any newly hatched fleas that bite her), as well as monthly Revolution."
1,Big Disappointment,"I ordered this because I thought it was larger than the Victor Flea Trap I normally use, and because it sounded like it would catch more fleas. I was very disappointed to find it much smaller than I thought and not nearly as good as the Victor Flea Trap. The light in it isn't even bright and the plastic covering gets in the way of catching the fleas instead of attracting them! I've had it plugged in for days in a basement room that became infested and only a few fleas are in the trap. If I walk through the room I get more than that on my pants! What a waste of money. If you are looking for a pesticide-free trap try the Victor Flea Trap, it's much better."
1,Not recommended,"I purchased this for my home in Florida after noticing several fleas on my animals in late spring. The bulb is supposed to put off a heat level that matches the same heat an animal laying on the floor would put off, but it produced very little heat. The glue on the trap was very sticky, and I'm sure a flea would have been stuck very well if a flea had been attracted enough to it to get stuck. I have used this for a month and caught absolutely nothing. The flea problem is gone fortunately, but that was done with a combination of bathing the animals, vacuuming every day, and using flea powers/flea sprays on the carpet and furniture. I was very disappointed."
5,Works well,It does it's job well. I've found many fleas in it. The design is good so that my cat can't accidentally get in it. I prefer this flea trap over a different one that I also bought.
1,Get A Clue,"What nonsense. Don't believe me? See if you can find anything else written by author ""Jane Self, PhD"" And check out the rest of the catalog from ""Breakthru Publishing."" If you think Werner Erhard was run out of town by the Scientologists, ask him why he ""made himself a victim,"" or ""created his own victimization,"" why don't you? This is just another feeble attempt salvage or rewrite or rearrange the facts of his - Werner Erhard's - sleazy reputation. Est ""acolytes"" and Landmark ""followers"" are so desperate to prop up an image of their hero they will believe anything. Even this kind of garbage."
4,A funny and heartwarming story,"Ms. Osborne captures two strong charaters on paper and makes them work wonderfully together. Jenny and Ty are both people of integrity who are used to working alone. An unusual situation throws them together and they must rely on each other to see their goals achieved. The writing was delightful, with witty conversation and good old fashion virtues. I found Jenny's attempts to curb her vocabulary around a 6 year old amusing (although I doubt she would have been using the work ""friking"" - but the stronger equivalant!). Although at first I balked at the title, Ms. Osborne chose a very clever title indeed... was it Jenny's verbal promise or her potential? Wonderful story!"
5,Entertaining read,"The ""Promise of Jenny Jones"" is a great story that you don't want to end. It combines adventure, humor, heartache and romance beautifully. I have already recommended this book several friends. This book is a keeper."
5,LOVED THIS BOOK!,Jenny Jones is a magnificent heroine and Ty is just the man for her. Put Graciela into the mix and you have a dynamite combination. I enjoyed every minute of this book. It is one of the best I have read for some time. It has everything!
4,Rubbermaid collapsible 3 piece set,"These are very handy for camping trips in a kayak on the river. They take up very little room, clean up easily. You can also use them as a plate in a pinch."
5,Rubbermaid Collapsibles Storage Set,These work so great. They are easy to clean and seal fantastically. The price is half that of the other nationally known storage products. I highly recommend them.
2,poorly made,"This is a wonderful idea and I was very excited to get rid of the bulky tupperwear in my kitchen. However, one of the bowls came to me broken- the side connecting to the rim was not connected thus leaking contents. Also if you put it in your fridge and then put something on top of it (which always happens in my fridge) the container may partially collapse. I had soup in the bowl and it ended up collapsing on one side. It did not leak as there was extra room in the bowl, but I wonder what would have happened if the bowl was full. Ive been meaning to write the company about my defective bowl but who has time for defects?"
2,neat idea,"I didn't have problems with lids not sealing or containers unexpectedly collapsing, but I guess I've been spoiled by the hard, non-staining BPA containers. I had these new containers discoloring in no time at all. I was soon resigned to buying glass containers instead and after a few months since this rubbermaid vs glass experiment, I'm glad I did."
5,Very Effective,"This knife sharpener does everything it says! But it doesn't stay coarse very long. I mean, I sharpen my work knives a lot! Atleast once a day. It still sharpens my work knives, and they stay sharp! I use my knives for everything! From chipping, cutting, poking holes in anything ,opening paint cans, to cleaning under my fingernails! I have bought a couple more and I would support this item 100%.Basically...Very effective knife sharpener! Would definitely recommed to anyone. I let my friends at work sharpen their knives and they ask me where to get one."
3,VERY coarse...,"For something this small and packable, it should be alot finer. It's too coarse for any knife I have unless I need to take out nicks in the edge of an ax."
1,Worthless,"I bought one of these yesterday, used it on one knife, for less than one minute, and nearly all of the ""triple-coated"" diamond finish has come off of the sharpener. After a series of failures over the last couple of years by other products from this company (from machetes to folding knives), this is decidedly the last time I will ever buy anything from this company again. And Gerber once had such a respectable name."
5,Excellent product.,I used this to sharpen the knife I use to open mail and packages. The knife went from dull to razor sharp in no time. The compact design makes it easy to stick in a pocket or bag (I store mine in my EDC pouch).
2,There are better sharpeners.,"This sharpener is decent, and it works, but Eze-Lap makes a better all-around sharpener. The main reason I've kept this one is for the fishing hook sharpener, which works well on certain types of serrations. But, on the flat side of mine, the diamond plating is falling off in areas, and exposes ordinary steel. It has a smaller length sharpening rod than the Eze-lap (~2.5 inches vs. 3.5 inches), but when retracted into the handle it is overall longer than the Eze-Lap (~5.5 inches vs. 4.5 inches). The Eze-Lap is about twice as much money (about $7.52 more on amazon), but it is well worth the investment as it is a much higher quality than this Gerber sharpener. Here is the link for the Eze-Lap model M.EZE-LAP M 1/4-Inch Round Diamond Sharpener with Brass Handle and Sheath"
4,Vary nice sharpener,This knife sharpener would have gotten 5 stars if it hadn't worn out so fast. I'm used to the old one by two inch wet stones (which work great). Having vary thick blades to sharpen like the cold steel SRK you'll want something a bit more hefty. Over all this is a good sharpener.
4,Little larger than I expected,I know it's quality with the Gerber name. The only disappointment with it was the size. I had hoped it was a little shorter so it would fit in a Gerber pouch I have and smaller in diameter so I could use it on serrated blades.
2,My least favorite Boyton book,"I am a huge fan of Sandra Boyton. We have almost all of her books. This is my least favorite. The rhythm is a bit off and it reads ""pajama time"" about 20 times in a very short book. Not at all interesting. Your money is better spent on ""But Not the Hippopatamus"" or ""Barnyard Dance"".Mom of 2."
2,Least favorite Boynton book,"We like many of Boynton's books. The stories are cute, the phrases are catchy, and our son loves the pictures. Pajama Time, however, is the exception. The words aren't sing-songy and interesting like the others, they just feel empty. There is no story here, just a silly song. We don't enjoy reading it at all-- I just can't get into reading ""jammy, jammy, jammy, jammy, p, j"" After a couple tries, we don't read this book at bedtime anymore. There are so many other great bedtime book options out there. I'm giving it two stars rather than one because the pictures are as good as ever."
3,Cute book,It's a cute little book but it did not catch my daughter's interest. Don't know why. She will sit to read with me but we can never finish the book together.
5,Another Great Bedtime Story,"Sandra Boynton does it again. She knows the routine, she sets it up perfectly and bedtime is easier because of her efforts. Our kids and grandkids loved these stories in a poetic rhyme. Now we are giving them out as Godparents to our neat friends we help mentor along life's way. Wonderful books!"
5,My favorite Sandra Boynton,"I absolutely have loved reading this so much to our two older grandchildren that I just had to order another for the third one! Can't say enough about the concept, rhythms, characters, etc. For me it even tops Barnyard Dance, which is my other Boynton favorite, although the two have much in common."
5,Such a fun book to read!,I borrowed a copy of this from the library. My kids loved it so much that I bought a copy for them. Sandra Boynton's illustrations and rhymes make this a fun book to read. This is a book that you won't dread seeing being carried to you by someone small and cute. I love Pajama Time.
3,Teaches kids to be judgemental,"The book is fun to read when you make up your own rhythm. But we don't approve of calling unique pajamas ""strange"" and having others leer at uniquely clad individuals as though they were weird. We changed the wording and picture in the book a bit to teach our child tolerance."
2,Imitation...,"I agree with number of people, ""The rhymes do not flow very well."" Of course they don't because she is heavily ""inspired"" from Dr.Seuss' book called one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish. When taken out of context, no wonder the rhymes do not flow well - you can not imitate the master!It was disappointing that she copied some of the lines verbatim: page 6 of the Seuss' book reads ""Some are red. And some are blue. Some are old and some are new."" So does her book...Don't waste your money with her book but get the Dr. Seuss's Beginner Book Collection. Brilliantly written and fun to read over and over..."
2,One of the very boring Boynton books,"Nothing exciting in this book. Very boring. Neither my son or I every pick up this book to read. Others like the Going to bed or ""but not the hippo"" are much much better."
2,Very Strange Book,"The ""rhymes"" in this book are really bizarre and choppy. I absolutely hated it and my son wasn't even slightly interested in it."
1,Waste of money!,The book looks ugly and the caricatures are weird. My son didn't like this book at all! he likes Good night moon though
1,Just not up to the Boyton Standard,"Sorry to be negative, but this book just didn't rate with me. We have every other Boyton book (through Amazon, I might add), but this one had no substance. It contained none of the cleverness of the Going to Bed Book, the fun of Barnyard Dance, or educational elements of Hippos Go Berserk. Classics such as these undoubtedly set high expectations, but I found this one to be a brand extension one step too far. There are lots of other more worthy alternatives."
2,Wasn't as advertised/promised,"Although the item was advertised as new, it arrived in a clearly worn & seemingly used condition. This was especially disappointing since the item was intended as part of a gift, and at that point there wasn't enough time to simply exchange it & wait for another one so I had to go shopping to replace it."
1,Dangerous for teethers!,We never got around to reading this book because my baby went right for mouthing it. A minute later I saw her face was covered in black specks of ink because the cover had started to disintegrate. The ink was really hard to get off and plenty was ingested. She mouths all of her board books and this has only happened with this one.
2,"Toddler and mommy both say ""meh"" to this one....","Since my toddler enjoys the ""Philedalphia Chickens"" CD by Boynton, I thought this book would be a good match since one of the songs is ""Pajama Time!"" Boy, were we wrong. The illustrations are classic Boynton, true, but it somehow lacks the charm of the recorded song. Not sure what it is, but even my book-loving toddler can't sit still for this one, and quickly loses interest (she usually will sit for a story from cover to cover). Together, we say ""meh"" to this one...save your money, and just listen to the song on the CD."
5,What a Fun Book,"My oldest girl, now 5, loved this book from an early age and now my son, 2, loves it too! They both love to ""dance"" along with the ""jammie to the left, jammie to the right"". We also enjoying matching the jammies we are wearing with the ones in the book. ""Some and red, some are blue, . . . they might be stripey, or polka dot, but we can all pajammy in whatever we got."" The book also ends gently and the ending helps makes the nights when they would rather not go to sleep more fun. We always look forward to reading this book."
5,"Classic, Must Have","This is a quick, fun and entertaining book for child and adult. The kids memorize the book quickly and enjoy having it read back to them time and tine again. Great for ages 2-5."
5,i love this book,My sister-in-law gave me this book when I had my son. I love it because it's so fun to read and it's catchy. I looked up more of Sandra Boynton's books after I read it.
5,baby books,"I first read this book when I was a student baby sitting for extra bucks. I discovered there was a rythm to the story and I turned it into a song. The kids loved it! now I have a little girl and bed time is her favorite time of day because of the book. She doesn't speak very well but sings along and knows what to say at each page. Sometimes she skips pages to her favorite parts (like ""pajama to the left, pajama to the right). it's so adorable. I'm glad that i started singing it to her otherwise I'd have been worn down with reading the same book every day of the year.A must buy!!"
2,"not good, especially for bedtime","It's too active for bedtime, not calming down until the very last page, and it just doesn't flow well anyway. I don't like it at all."
2,"Has South gone ""South""?","In purchasing this cd I was hoping that it would at least MATCH the shear feel and sonic intensity of their last album WITH THE TIDES, but for me, it just falls short.The album does have it's moments, dont get me wrong, but sadly I dont enjoy this album as much as WITH THE TIDES, or even their first one.These guys are a great band, and certainly proved it on their last album, and I do appreciate the attempt they made to stretch the boundaries of their sound, but I do believe what makes them great is their ability to craft huge, soaring ,melodies, and take me to another world with their music.I have given this record more than a few listens, and just cant find it interesting, or even edgy like their last one. Hopefully the next cd revisits what made them great."
4,Two steps back.....and for the better,"I for one like the lo-fi, am radio sound and feel of the first record. I also liked the big sweeping rush of sound that the second album brought with it. But I am glad to see them step back into the lo-fi, low profile sound that first struck a chord with me.They still pack a punch from time to time, but the melodies drive the cart, and they drive with passion.This is a great record that should please all those that were a little saddend by the second record. I can't wait to see them play a small venue in Los Angeles soon. Hopefully the Troubadour!"
2,Big Dissapointment,"As finding their album ""With The Tides"" by mistake and getting an amazing-huge sounding album that would give most other britpop bands a run for their money, South has gone in the other direction and definately not for the better. Instead of crafting their moody atmospheric sound, they exchanged it for the more indie-pop trend that is exploding at the moment. Instead of what could have been another great album, they made a boring run of the mill soundtrack that blends in with 99% of the other bands out at the moment. What a surprise it was to me when I saw them in chicago sounding exactly the same as the other bands, sorry guys, go back to what you were excellent at doing on your first 2 records instead of trying to sell more..."
1,horrible gramatic structure,"while the content is interesting, the poor grammar throughout the text makes it difficult to understand. There are run-on sentences in every paragraph, as matter of fact, many long paragraphs are just one sentence! This book could use a good editor."
3,"A good study supplement, but poor primary resource","I am currently taking an upper division molecular biochemistry course. The professor recommended the Weaver text as additional reading. I have found the book useful in working through the theory and the methodology presented in the course. As some of the reviews have stated, the book rushes through some concepts and does not make good use of conceptual models; however as a supplement to the primary text-Molecular Biology of the Gene, Watson et al-the text is quite useful in understanding and applying the material. I would not recommend any professor using the text as a primary resource in an introductory course. A solid background in biochemistry is useful in fully understanding the text."
3,Decent introductory micro bio book,"Ordered because it was required reading. Not a bad book, but at this point they now have more current editions."
4,Happy pushing a pink stroller,"I bought this stroller mainly because it is lightweight and I could easily get it in and out of my car trunk without straining. Secondly, I bought this stroller because it is pink and didn't look like a boy stroller. I was a bit worried that it was a little flimsy and hoped I wouldn't regret my decision. Now, after having used the stroller I am happy with my decision. I have no trouble lifting the stroller in and out of my car (just as I thought) and the strap system that raises and reclines the seating position is sturdier than I thought it might be.I also bought the matching car seat. I like how it attaches easily to the stroller. The only downside that I have found is that when the car seat is attached to the stroller, my daughter appears to be tilted forward more than is comfortable.Everytime I have this stroller in use someone comments on how cute the pink is- which isn't important to the function of the stroller, of course, but the comments make me smile!"
2,Poorly made,"This stroller isn't very light and is impossible to open or close if you are holding the baby in one arm. It rattles and shakes alot, which does unintentionally rock the baby to sleep, and it isn't easy to manuver. I bought a MacLaren and I am a lot happier with it. It's lighter and easier to use. However, this stroller does work well with the infant seat, which we were able to use that function for four months before my baby outgrew the infant seat."
2,wrong product,"I ordered a reversible black & tan Sean John jacket and received a reversible black & gray Sean John jacket. I didn't want to go through the hassle of exchanging via package mail as I needed the jacket, so I settled for it."
3,Welsh History....,"I found myself enjoying this book for the most part, though it was SO long I found myself wondering what could possibly happen to this poor woman.....and how much of it was historically accurate - I wasn't at all thrilled with how Joan (her mother) was portrayed, however the story did draw me in and I'd recommend it for someone who had, say, a ten hour flight somewhere and wanted to have a good long read that wasn't too intellectual...."
3,A Pleasing read,"Not one of Barbara Erskine's best efforts... but then I'm not really good with LONG books; I tend to drift off 2/3 of te way through. Still a good read though, but I felt it could have done with a bit of pruning here and there. I'm still a big fan though, and excited at the prospect of a new novel later this year.In the meantime, if you're looking for something similar, look out for MASTER OF THE SCROLLS by Benjamin Ford... well worth a read!"
3,"It Works, But . .","I use this AC charger for my iPaq 3700 when I am on the road and away from the iPaq cradle attached to my desktop. It powers the unit when attached (and plugged into a wall socket, of course) and charges the battery. I often use my PDA to get my e-mail when I am on the road and using the adapter lets me keep the power up during my lengthy email sessions.Why only three stars? Well, whether it is just my charger or if it is common to all chargers, the power seems to fluctuate while it is plugged in. If I have the backlight on, the light will literally pulse. It gets irritating enough for me to shut the backlight off. I have seen no problems with my PDA while using this charger, other than that pulsing. I assume that it has something to do with the waveform of the AC to DC power conversion, but I'm no electrical engineer. It does make me wonder, though, if it might not be the best thing for my iPaq."
4,The Seventh Slice: Part 4,"For the 25th Anniversary of TMNT, LionsGate released Season 7 in four part DVDs.Season 7 Part 4 Episodes are:Night of the RoguesRevenge of the FlyDirk Savages: Mutant Hunter!Combat LandAtlantis AwakensInvasion of the KrangazoidsShredder Triumphant!The special feature is A Shellabration of a Fan-Nomenon Sensation: Devoted and Die-Hard TMNT Fans Speak!I only bought the season in four parts so I could get the the miniature TMNT toys. I recommend others to buy theTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete Season 7 Set."
4,Close It With A Bang,"Ah the last disk in the series. I gotta say this one probably has the best episodes on it. My favorite one being ""Night of the Rogues"" where Shredder hires all of the turtles toughest enemies to take them out. The magic is really in these episodes and the shows humor.Again the special features are on the crap side but the episodes more then make up for that. I wasn't counting on getting any special features cause we haven't been getting them really so I can't complain too much.If your a fan of old or new, you want to remember the turtles, get this set it's great."
5,Chicken Soup for the Caregiver's Soul,"You never go wrong selecting a ""Chicken Soup"" book.This one is no exception, indeed it does warm the Soul."
5,Great Book,I love these books. I am always reading one of these books. They never disappoint. Any of these books are a good read.
5,I really enjoyed the book.,This book was a great inspiration to me because I'm a nursing assistant in a nursing home and I read it when I'm feeling down and tired. Its nice to know that other people feel the same way yet we push on because we care.
5,Great little unit,"It's simple, and works very well. The wife and I are dehydrating food and using this sealer to package it for long term storage to survive the onslaught of delusional hopey changy socialism that is poised to destroy the United States of America as we know it."
4,tube fuzz,"I bought this microphone preamp to use between my electric guitar and a 20W practice amp. It adds alot of warmth, and when properly overdriven, gives a great fuzz sound to my playing. I have a friend that also actually uses his to power a microphone! wow!"
3,I'm not sure it's really psych..........,"This is a release from the sadly defunct See For Miles label, first launched in the vinyl era, and responsible for many fabulous compilations and career retrospectives. See For Miles comps, to the best of my recollection, predate Rubble, Pebbles, etc., so it was a cutting edge endeavor at the time. This, sadly, is not one of the best things to come out on SFM. The album cover gives you the expectation of rather heavy German prog. What you get, actually, is hardly even psych. Stylistically, you can hear the Turtles and Squeeze in the music. Mostly pleasant, but not very significant, and certainly not up to the promise of the banner ""Classic Psychedelia!"""
5,Intersections; Architectural Histories and Critical Theories,"This book is essential to anyone aspiring to be an architect. For the greatest assets of an architect are his understandings of the history behind the buildings of a city and not only the history, but also the theories driving the great architects to make their decisions.Iain Borden and all those who contributed to this work make this clear in their wonderfully crafted book."
4,An overlooked show,"Get this show if only for the very tight Lost>Can't Stop Now and the Rhythm of the Road>Come As You Are! Also this show features the elusive Blackberry Blossom. The Impressions is great as usual.Peace,Dave"
2,Ill-fated Two Nation Theory,"I am a Pakistani who loves his country and I have studied the history of my country at greater depths.Gen Niazi, Bhutto, Yahya and lots of others were greatly involved in the separation of East Pakistan and responsible for what happened.Pakistani army killed and raped millions in East Pakistan of their own country men and women (mostly muslim) quite shamelessly and put the two-nation theory in serious trouble that is the very reason for Pakistan's existence. The feudal lords in government of the west Pakistan did always treat East Pakistan as third class citizens.Gen Niazi was as involved in the whole mess as any one else and has made a very cowardly attempt to gain some dignity by writing this book.Shame on Niazi, Bhutto and Yahya and shame on Pakistani army who killed and raped Pakistani citizens.May your ashes burn in hell if there is such a thing.From the heart of a Pakistani"
2,Delirious ranting of a defeated general,"The title reveals a lot about the book and the 1971 mindset of defeated Pakistani Army and it's eastern command. The general tells us a lot about conspiracy theory, while carefully excluding the account of massacre, pillage and raping of a defenseless 3 million Bengalis by his troops. Also the statements made out regarding the might of Pakistani army really sounds misleading, if this was the case then one wonders how the war ended in just 9 months. This is one defeated pakistani general who just can not forget the past! Maybe a tribunal for his war crimes will help!"
1,A solo chanting by a defeated General,"It was inconceivable how Niazi was trying to shift his part of the responsibility on to others through far-fetched excuses. The book had serious lack of fact. It was more like a fruitless attempt by an old and broken soldier to restore some sort of dignity. Niazi's legacy is too thick to change by a book just like Hitler, Stalin and PolPot. ""In the pages of history the legacy of Mr. Niazi will always be as a Pakistani General who lead a bloody war in 1971; under his command 3 million innocent civilian people were killed by his troop, including women and children. 27,000 women were raped and not to mention the mounting amount of intentional destruction. At the end, he lost; bringing an ultimate defeat for his nation-Pakistan!"""
1,DENIAL IS WONDERFUL,"The so called General has tried to cover up his own failures. I was surprised at his auducity to write this. Shows that denial is a wonderful thing. A skewed view of events, a blatant attempt to distort history."
2,Not what I expected for the price paid,"Considering the price of this, I expected more than a little 18 minutes."
4,Midnight Catapilla Metamorphosis,"OK. First, this album is NOT by Catapilla, but by the great Scandinavian prog band Midnight Sun. This CD is a combination of two of their albums from the early '70s: Walking Circles - 1972, and Midnight Dream - 1974. These albums were a staple for me in the '70s, and I was pleased to see them released on CD in 2000. If you like Progressive Rock, with a tinge of fusion on the side, don't pass this one up."
2,"Dull, listless, sad","This is what happens when great authors go to seed. It seems like a cruel mockery of a Greene novel, parading the same old themes around, corrupted more than ever by an unjustified excess liberalism. There isn't a single living character here, and even though the prose is generally competent, I think it has to be buried in consideration of the man's memory."
2,"Greene sets the bar high with previous works, and this doesn't reach it","Rather plodding book with many of the same well-worn features of earlier Greene efforts. Ultimately, the narrator (Dr. Plarr) is so disassociated from recognizable human emotion that he becomes a caricature of the a standard Greene plot device.Not a bad book if taken singly from Greene's other works, but there are much better representatives of this type of effort in 'The Quiet American' or 'The Confidential Agent'"
4,great book for geographer,highly comprehensively give people an overall geography's development. it's good for further appreciate geography. very thoughtful book. I recommend it to geographers
2,Predictable stories,"This was a spur of the moment purchase while looking for something else. I love happy endings, but I found these stories to be too predictable and lost interest pretty quickly."
2,Another wife betrayed,"Maybe I'm not cut out for these stories of women betrayed by deep, dark secrets. Kathryn's anguish over the plane crash that takes her husband is wrenching. The eventual revelations that she gets, from the news releases, from the man from the airline assigned to help her through this, are intriguing. One always wonders about the families in these crashes, how it is handled, what they must experience.However, her investigation to clear her husband's name when it appears he is responsible for the crash leads to discoveries that she really didn't know him at all. It was fairly obvious to me quite early on what was going on in his life. Even the supposed plot twist was one I could see coming. I'm sure the intent was to create a story with unexpected twists and turns in the plot line, but they seemed like familiar territory to me. Another Oprah pick I wouldn't have chosen myself."
2,Predictable!,"I should have loved this book - this is the exact type of story I'm particularly fond of, but I found this book extrememly predictable and I didn't care for the choices the heroine makes. There are better books than this one!"
2,"The Author must know ""airline people""","The dreaded middle of the night awaking by a stranger was most accurate. I have been married to a pilot for 18 years, the the events of the union reps. and press-vultures descending on Kathryn's doorstep are most accurate. The unbelievable part is how dense this woman was. All the ""pilot's wives"" I know can manage all the finances, parent the children, handle holidays without dad, and have some basic knowledge of ""company benefits"", such as reduced rate/pass travel...she never flew on his airplane?? Even wives of all-freight pilots are clued into the ""perks"".This was one dense woman. NOT a true ""Pilot's Wife"". I almost wanted to cheer for the evil former flight attendant, at least she knew who she was hooked up with!!"
2,KATHRYN AS A PILOT'S WIFE - WEAK AND UNREALISTIC CHARACTER,"I feel that Ms.Schreve could have researched the factual data of being a pilot's wife. I was stunned that after 15/16 years of marriage, she had NEVER flown aboard his aircraft. The fact is, that we as spouses and family, have the priveldge of not only accompaning our spouse, but the luxury of extensive traveling.Not only was she naive about his occupation, but not to know who their insurance company/agent was? This lends itself to incredibility. My husband is a captain, his job is flying. With the odd schedules and the physiological punishment on his body, does he have time to manage our finances. Yet, Kathyrn, with an only child, is unable to run to run their household. Truth be known, what is she really doing while her husband is flying?This leads to the portral of Kathyrn as weak, unadventerous and naive. Kathyrn wake up and smell the coffee!!"
3,Predictable,"The story of secrets uncovered in the aftermath of a death is not a new story, and unfortunately, Shreve didn't take the opportunity to put a new and original twist on it.She did a good job with the development of Kathryn, the pilot's wife who grieves and then discovers a side of her husband she didn't know about during his life. I didn't find Jack (the pilot) to be as well-developed. I had a hard time believing he would have laid the groundwork for some of his deceptions so early on in their relationship, and I didn't find his relationship with their daughter strong enough to have warranted the decisions he made about how he'd live his life.It was certainly an easy read and a page-turner, but not one that left you mulling it over after closing the book for the last time. I had expected more."
3,Intriguing...,"So the characters weren't as 3-dimensional as one might hope, and you're left with the distinct feeling that something is missing... Overall, the book is entertaining, and that's what matters. It held my attention from the very beginning, and I read it in record time. I would recommend it--I've already passed my copy along!"
3,"Predictable, but enjoyable; well-written narrative","I found myself wanting to read this book in one sitting. The writing style is so fluid it makes it easy to just keep reading. It's not a complex story; you don't have to do any real thinking, but it's still compelling. It's not a mystery; it's more like a glimpse of an important moment in this woman's life after her husband is killed in a plane crash. You watch her deal with the pain and confusion and try to pick up the pieces of her life as she tries to figure out exactly what kind of man her husband was. The novel jumps from the present to flashbacks between the husband and wife, a nice effect which gives you a view of their relationship. The story is a little predictable, but it's enjoyable reading anyway. The first Oprah pick I have actually liked at all. Also recommended: Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson, The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, and We Were the Mulvaneys by Joyce Carol Oates."
4,Atention grabbing summer read!,"I enjoyed this novel. It was fun to read and I was finished in two nights. It was a realistic plot and filled with real human emotion. You should enjoy this book or wait till the movie, it would make a great movie......Sissy Spacek as the wife, Catherine Zeta Jones the former flight attendant, Liam Neeson as the union rep......."
3,"Beginning, Great - Middle, Good - Ending, Disappointing","For the most part, I really enjoyed reading this book (and on an airplane no less!) It was an easy read, and unlike some other reviewers, I felt there was enought character development, but the ending seemed out of place and was just too abrupt; it left me feeling like there just had to be more. I do, however, look foward to reading more of this author's books!"
4,A Book Well Written,"A creepy, yet somehow heartwarming tale, ""The Pilot's Wife"" is a book that I would certainly recommend to anyone. The story follows a woman, Kathryn, who loses her husband, and also finds many questions unanswered, all in a short time span. The book is a quick, easy read, but it also leaves the reader with many questions to ask themselves. Once I started the novel, I couldn't put it down. Although the author does go into a lot of detail at certain points, I think it helped because it made me feel as if I was there. The plot does seem a little unbelievable at first, but yet I found myself asking ""Could this really happen?"" All in all, I found this book very enjoyable, and would like to read more by Anita Shreve."
3,Well written but unbelieveable,"I don't think the author should have 'set the husband up' to be such a saint in the first place. But I do think it was well written. Although I will admit I skimmed through much of it, I will also say that the story 'stayed with me' for some time. It wasn't as a result of the bizarre ending...it was more the quality of Ms. Shreve's writing abilites. For that alone, this is a worthwhile read."
2,What happened? I usually love Oprah's picks...,"but this book is not worthy of being placed on the same list as ""A Lesson Before Dying"" or ""Paradise,"" among others. That is not to say this book is without its merits- the story becomes more engaging as it progresses- but the story is more suited for a movie of the week than a work of literature."
2,"Three words: Predictable, predictable, predictable","I was disappointed as all the other Oprah books I'd read were excellent. No surprises here. Did I say predictable?That said, The Pilot's Wife IS a quick-read, and entertaining (in the mindless, 'People' magazine sort of way). As others have said, good reading for the beach or the pool. If you want to read it, borrow it from the Library!"
1,I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this book!,"This book was so bad, that I couldn't wait to finish it. Luckily, it only took 2 days. (It's less than 300 pages, BIG font size.) It's been only a few weeks since I've read this book, but because the characters were so pathetic and unlikeable, I honestly can't recall most of their names. Oprah blew it when she recommended this snoozer!"
2,I waited and waited for it to get interesting!,This book had a great premise...but as I read it I thought there is no way it is going to be this simple. It is TOTALLY predictable! The ending is a complete let down. My biggest problem with this book is that I felt no suspense and I just didn't care about the characters.
4,Good read,"The Pilot's Wife is almsot as good as The Triumph and the Glory and Memoirs of a Geisha, the other two books I've read this month. It suffered somewhat from predictability and lacked some depth, but all in all it was worthwhile reading. Anita Shreve has done better though."
3,Easy read with a dissapointing finish.,"This book was addictive from the start. I could not put it down and waited with anticipation for the next chapter. As I began to near the end of the novel I became disappointed with the Author's lack of explanation. Rather than answer any of the obvious questions which arise, she quickly summarizes events. Great beggining, not such a great end."
2,Easy Read Lacking Detail and Development,"300 pages and nothing happened. It needed more detail and development. That which was there I found to be superficial. I haven't read any of the author's other books, but her style in this one would have been better fit into a short story."
3,Interesting Beach day reading,"Anita Shreve appears to be a direct and to-the-point writer giving the reader little thrill of anticipation but a direct and straight forward storyline. Her main character demonstrates what would appear to be real life emotional dips well reflective of her situation. I did question if in fact the airlines does assign a ""union rep"" to ward off any slips in language that would possilbly invite a law suit during the crisis of a major disaster.The wife's discovery of her husband's double life added an interesting twist to an abrupt ending. I figured her and the ""union rep"" would end up an item and I was looking for a little excitement to bring the book to a close with an up beat ending that never happened.Although this book lacks a more indepth appeal, I might be tempted to read some of her previous books and would recommend it as a quick summer read at the beach."
4,Good Book,"After reading ""Resistance"" and ""The Weight of Water"" by Anita Shreve, I was just a bit disappointed by ""The Pilot's Wife"".Her previous books compare with Tom Wolfe in her ""research of details"" style. The plot of Pilot's Wife was just a bit predictable. This is an interesting book- just not her best."
2,Disappointing!,I found the Pilot's Wife difficult to read in that the literary style was disjointed. The plot was mundane and unbelievable. First book I read by and Anita Shreve and it will be the last.
2,Made a pilot's wife look REAL stupid!!,"I am a commercial airline pilot's wife, in fact my husband flies international. After reading this book I had to check to see if I still had a pulse, because I felt it lacked in so much. Us wives do communicate with our husbands when they are away on trips, even if they are flying international. It would have been pretty hard for Jack to have a 2nd wife if wife #1 took an ounce of interest in him. Just because the man is up in the air most of the time doesn't mean the wife is always kept in the dark. Her character was so unreal. Us spouses are very much in touch with our husbands and their whereabouts. Didn't sound like Jack's wife took advantage of her pass benefits very much, nor did she care to fly a trip with her husband. No wonder Jack found a wife across the ocean!!"
3,A nice read but lacking depth in important spots,"The Pilot's Wife was a nice read and I found it hard to put down. The suspense was well presented but on the whole the book lacked depth. There were many occassions and characters that could have been explored more deeply. I believe that the husband's past had a lot to offer but was never explored. I also believe that the daughter, grandmother and husband's mother could have been presented more fully in particular their relationship to the wife and husband. I almost want to write more myself to produce a more full story - when it ended, I was a bit disappointed that the story wasn't more. But time reading this book is not time wasted."
4,Surprised at other reviews,"I just finished reading this book and I was very surprised to read the volume of negative reactions to this book. I thought the book was extremely well written. True, the plot was predictable, but I don't think the plot was the point. Rather, I think the human reaction to tragedy and to betrayal was the point of the book. There is no question that the book was about a naive woman, but then again, maybe you don't know you're naive until there is an event that tells you so."
3,Not a fan of Shreve,"When I first read The Pilot's Wife I thought it was pretty good, but with a not so good ending. It was a book that I enjoyed until it just kind of dropped off at the end. But then I read The Weight of Water and was quite dissapointed by that. It also seemed not to have a real ending. And finally, I gave it one more try and read Where or When. I just finished it today and have decided that Shreve just isn't a very good writer. She doesn't develop characters and her endings are terrible. The central characters in Where or When were totally unlikeable and unsympatheic. I hope Shreve's own life is not reflected in her stories, because her stories are nothing special."
1,Painfully slow,"I have to agree with the reader from Michigan--take out the needless (and endless) descriptions of the house, the town, the weather, etc. and the book would have been 150 pages shorter in length. I felt like we were still on day one 100 pages into the book. I though the plot was a good one--a woman's husband leading a double life--but the excitement of learning about ""the other woman"" is quickly lost. We don't know enough about the husband or his marriage to Kathryn to really understand his motive. I also found it very annoying how the story went from present to past. It was not a smooth enough transition to keep the story flowing."
1,THe Pilot's Wife,"I rarely write reviews on Amazon, but I feel I must in this case. This must be one of the most overrated novels of the century. It's predictable, cliche, and manipulative. I can see how it would appeal to someone who needs some light reading, but this actually borders on romance-novel bad. The ending is so badly written and outlandish, that i felt embarrassed while reading it. I left my copy on the airplane! I suggest you do the same!"
2,The Pilot's Wife,Not a bad story but a rather wierd ending. Story of wife who never knows her husband who has second family. Story just stops with no closure.
3,Hmmmmmm,"This book had a good start, but when it came to the end and to the things that you really wanted to know more about or see more reactions to..it was left short.I could feel for Kathryn, but I wanted to know more about her anger and disbelief once she found out the truth. The book was not all bad so I gave it a 3."
3,DIDN'T LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS,"I enjoyed the book however felt the first half was slow and dragged on, particularly having to wait until three quarters of the way into the book before ""The secret"" was revealed. Not my choice for a good holiday read."
1,This book really deserves 0 stars,"Can anyone point to anything Jack and Kathryn had in common or ever did together besides ""make love,"" which is mentioned every 5 pages or so and seems to be the only thing she misses after he dies? This book is carelessly written (for example, I don't think green is a primary color although it is referred to as one) and not researched all that well (is it a normal American reference to continuously mention ""the Troubles"" with no further explanation? And to say the British position is just ""stupid""?) It's a shame this book is so incredibly lame, because The Weight of Water was really good but after The Pilot's Wife I'll never be able to stomach another of this author's novels."
3,Diverting if a bit predictable,"I was given this book by my mother who knows I love books written by Anita Shreve. However, this one really disappointed me. I am surprised because I think it was this book that was picked for Oprah's Book Club. I have to say that in my view, this is one of the weaker novels by Shreve that I have read. Books like Fortune's Rocks, The Weight of Water and, my personal favourite, The Last Time They Met, are far superior in style and content.That said, Shreve is head and shoulders above most writers and I still enjoyed this book immensely. This is a story about a widow who discovers her husband's secret life after he dies at the helm of the plane he was flying, killing nearly 200 passengers along with him. Although the plot is not hard to predict, it is nevertheless a very engrossing story. Those readers who have not yet discovered the marvellous Anita Shreve will be sucked in!"
2,far-fetched,"The story was semi-believable when it was the story of a man with 2 families. When you trust someone and love them you may become short-sighted, not look at things with suspicion. I think the author went too far when she made the husband a religious fanatic, and an IRA sympathizer. How could these feelings not spill over into his other life? Just not believable."
3,Made me feel lucky,This story was one that was fast paced until the end. The end became a little slow but I enjoyed the book. While you can predict what her husband was up to the story still manages to cast a few little surprises here and there that you did not expect. I loved how the story went back and forth from present to the past. The author also was able to weave the characters into the reader so that you could feel the emotions of Kathryn and actually feel yourself pulling for the relationship between kathryn and her daughter and for her new friendship with Robert. I really liked the book.
3,"Close, but not quite","The intentions of this book are lost with far too many descriptions and a disappointing end. Not only will the reader be left ""hanging"" but the very purpose of the book--which I would assume to be an exploration of one's own mate and/or closest relatives- is lost because the disappointment overshadows the real purpose. Take out the endless descriptons of Kathryn's wardrobe and home, and the book is probably 50 pages! It would have been sufficent to describe Kathryn physically at the beginning of the book and lose the rest. I was also sorry that Mattie was sort of cast aside right when I felt we were getting to know her a little better. This book could also use a follow up! I'd recommend it for a long weekend, but be prepared for the disappointment."
2,"Easy Read, Mediocre Book","Danielle Steele with a little Tom Glancy thrown in for good measure. The descriptions of initial young, unexpected widowhood were very good, as was the sense of place -- but the plot contrivances were trite. Even the theme of ""how well do we know those we love"" was played out in the most extreme, yet predictable way possible. If you need a quick vacation read and like descriptions of the Maine coast, borrow it from a friend, and tuck it in your beach bag. If you want something new, insightful, and interesting -- don't bother."
2,Not a high flyer!,"I bought the book because I have enjoyed watching the discussions of the books Oprah chooses, even if I have not read them. I had read the previous selection, The Reader by Bernard Schlink, before Oprah chose it. Didn't like that one. Didn't like this one. Maybe I don't like Oprah's choice of books?! The Pilot's Wife is, as others have said, too predictable and lacks character development. What pained me to read it, though, is the lack of artistry in the writing. No imagery, nothing interesting in the language, nothing to nourish the mind. It is the kind of book to read on a plane - you can only half pay attention, and you'll finish it before you land. I believe people can appreciate more challenging literature than this."
2,unimaginative,"While I found The Pilot's Wife to be compelling, I was continuously disappointed by each revelation about Jack's secret life. Without giving the plot away to potential readers, the secrets are terribly predictable. Shreve could have come up with something more imaginative. A friend of mine guessed the entire plot after I gave him two clues that the reader is presented with in the book jacket summary: a plane explodes off the coast of Ireland and a husband is hiding something from his wife. The concept of a secret life is rife with possiblities, too bad Shreve didn't bother to explore any but the obvious."
1,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Totally predictable! I kept hoping that it would veer off in another direction but it stayed the course to a very predictable ending.
1,Don't waste your money.,"This book was boring and predictable from the beginning. I kept wanting something to happen, but all the characters kept doing was reacting to what already happened. I could not identify with the main character, the wife. She seemed so weak and stupid. I like most of Oprah's other books, but this one isn't worth the time"
2,A predictable disappointment,"I have enjoyed many of Oprah's selections, but can't figure out why she picked this one. The plot is interesting, and the theme -- how we never know how well we REALLY know someone -- is compelling. However, the characters are stock and shallow, and the story winds down to a predictable conclusion. Save your money and look elsewhere for a good read!"
4,Thoroughly engaging. I couldn't put it down.,"Even though I knew how it would end, I still couldn't put it down. I love the way the story unfolds, how she believes her husband to faithful and devoted and then finds out he has a whole other family in London, the supposed suicide, the hint of a romance yet to come. Entirely fiction but also entirely possible. It's a good light read."
1,seemed written primarly to be made into a movie,"I was very disappointed in this one...especially since I usually agree with Oprahs suggestions. It read like a screenplay and I kept imagining the actors in the movie (I KNOW it will be a movie, just has to be)-Michelle Pfeiffer as the wife and Kevin Costner as the inspector. Just a big bummer, and no big surprise ending either...You know what's coming, you only wish it didn't take so long to get there."
2,"Probably a good ""stuck in the airport"" read","Sorry if I'm a bit dense but I found the last page confusing. If the pilot is dead and wife #2 is in jail, then to whom is Kathryn speaking when she calls to ask about the children? Please email with any answers or thoughts. Poorly written and predictable."
3,"good story, bad ending","From the first page I was wrapped up into the lives of the characters in the book. I enjoyed the story line and felt a great amount of compassion for Kathryn, however her reaction to the entire situation was a bit dull and disconnected. Overall, I enjoyed the book all the way through but the end could totally be rewritten for the sake of the book in general. If the ending would have been more satisfying and understandable to the reader, I personally would have given it 4 or 5 stars."
1,"BORING, BORING, BORING...","It really bothered me that I spent the money to buy this book. You find out by reading the book's jacket that the husband dies, so what. Three quarters of the way through the book we don't know much else. We read about the wife's dealing with death, how can that excite anyone. The characters are boring, not developed and the ending I thought was just a last minute idea the author had to try to pull the book together."
3,"Dislike the audiobook, not the book","The reader for these cassettes has the sort of correct, impersonal voice that kills a storyline. I depend on audiobooks for my commute, but think I'll turn this one in for paper copy."
2,Abrupt ending,"While this was a no-brainer, entertaining read while flying cross-country, when I got to the end I thought, ""Am I missing some pages?"" So, I went to a bookstore to look at another copy and discovered that I had, in fact, read the entire book. It was a very strange and abrupt ending. I'm curious if anyone else felt that way."
2,Sooo Predictable,This book was sooo predictableObvsiously Jack had some mysterious secret...take a guess at what that was--duh.Kathryn and Robert...predictableIt took more than half the book for the pase to pick up
2,What's the big deal about this book???,"This was my second Anita Shreve book, and after I just couldn't get into the first one (A December Wedding) and found it miserably boring, several people suggested I read The Pilot's Wife because it is ""fantastic"". Again I was not pleased. Although the story progessed in a natural and logical manner, I had the entire plot line figured out in the first several chapters. Even if Shreve intended for the ""twist"" to be predictable and wanted to write more about the grieving process, she did not do that well. The antagonist's grieving process went from being extremely realistic to being overly cheesy and fake within a matter of sentences. The ending also had me sitting in my chair asking myself what in the world just happened! It was extremley abrupt and confusing. Quite frankly I don't see what the big deal is about this book or Anita Shreve."
3,Predictable but somewhat captivating,"This novel is the perfect book to bring to the beach or on summer vacation. It is an easy read and holds the reader's attention. The plot twists are predictable, but the descriptions by the author still draw you into the moment.The characters are well developed and the reader will find themselves wanting to find out what will happen next. Luckily, because of the length of the novel and the easiness of the read, the reader will not have to wait long."
2,Your Time is Precious don't Waste it!!!,"This book is terrible, usually Oprah recommends good ones but this is not one of them. It totally wasted my time, it took half of the book just to get the plot established and then after that everything else was obvious. Please I beg you don't waste your time, read something else."
2,Was very disappointed in this book,"This is the third Oprah book I've read and have struggled to finish only to be very disappointed. The story itself had potential, but was very poorly written."
2,A Pretty Predictable Easy-Read,"I've read several of the Oprah selections and by the end of the book I generally agree with her rave reveiws --- not the case this time. It wasn't terrible, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was simple and extremely predictable. So much more could have been done with the content and the character development. For example, once the IRA is introduced - why didn't Shreve build on the historical content? Develop around the movement? The book was OK --- an easy to read plot that had the potential to evolve, but never did!"
3,It's a small book. It tells a nice story.,I liked this book. I was not moved by this book. Sometimes you just want to know that you don't have to invest too much of yourself in what you are reading. This is the book for that occasion. It does ask an insurmountable question. Do we really know the people who live with us? Are we really sure that they are not just what we allow ourselves to believe they are?
2,Not well-written; not entertaining,"I have generally enjoyed books that were selected by Oprah. This one, however, was not particularly well-written nor entertaining. The conclusion was too obvious. Characters disinteresting. Many other ""Oprah"" selections to choose from!"
1,An unfulfilling novel,"This book is quite remarkable in many ways. It is a real page-turner and like many a reviewer, I read it in a single sitting. Yet it is also a rather vacuous book with a contrived and rather silly conclusion. This is truly the stuff that throwaway literature is made of!"
3,"A good read, but not great by any means.","I personally didn't think the characters or plot were developed far enough and I didn't like the way the book ended at all. I think Haynsworth's ""Amelia Earhart's Daughters"" and Van Keil's ""Those Wonderful Women and Their Flying Machines,"" are much much better. My favorite action thriller involving high tech aerospace and conspiracy is ""Alien Rapture"" by Steiger."
4,An easy read which left me wanting more.,An interesting tale which surprised me completely.I wanted to see more of the characters. This was my first Shreve book but certainly won't be my last!
2,Not worth the time or money,I was highly disappointed in this book. After hearing Oprah's recommendations I was sure I would like this book. I was wrong and will think twice before I purchase a book she has added to her book club. This is the first time I have read one and don't know if I will again.
3,A quick - moderately entertaining read,I finished this book in about 4 hours during a plane ride. The plot pushes the limits of reality even for a fictional novel.
1,fluff....and extremely boring fluff at that!,"Thought this sounded good, and when it was chosen by our book group as the reading material of the month, I was anxious to get reading it. However, someone had said it was a page turner....and it was for me too......skimming doesn't take much time!! and I wasted mine with this book!!"
3,the Pilot's Wife is boring because it is too predictable,"While the story plot could have been an interesting one, what is most annoying is that the characters are not fully developed in depth--I feel slighted, particularly because I love mysteries."
5,Couldn't put it down!,This is my first time reading Anita Shreve. I loved it!! I finished it in one day b/c I couldn't put it down.
4,Quick enjoyable read,This is my first Anita Shreve book and I'm looking forward to reading more. It is quick easy read with draws you deeper and deeper into the story.
2,A bit on the boring side...,"If you want to know the story, just read the back of the book. It was too heavy on the emotions and slow-moving. Too many side dishes and not enough meat for me."
2,I was disappointed,"I loved Anita Shreve's ""The Weight of Water,"" and ""Sea Glass."" I read ""The Pilot's Wife"" after these two, and found it to be a disappointment. I think there was too much re: the initial shock and grief and too little of the ""meat"" of the story."
3,"A Quick Read, Interesting but not much depth","This book will hold your interest. The story is interesting and the author has a good handle on grief and how people react to sudden loss.. I was disappointed in the end of the story,as I think we really gain little insight into the husbands psyche."
1,This book reads like a J Peterman catalog.,"This book was just one precious scene after another. From the old, ramshackle house they lovingly restored to the fact that they met in an antique shop, for pete's sake. The characters were so flat they seemed to only exist as props in the scenes. I felt none of the pain one would expect to feel when a wife loses a husband. I was greatly disappointed, as I often am by what passes for literature in modern america."
3,A Fairly Good Pool Side Book -But Don't Get Your Hopes Up,"Although I was not as intrigued by The Pilot's Wife as others seemed to be (and as Oprah thought we would), it was a fairly decent book to read in order to relax. The characters were not well drawn out, the book was extremely predictable and had such an abrupt ending. The flashbacks were somewhat confusing at times because once the author returned you to present time, you didn't know exactly what day it was! I am however, peaked to read the author's Weight of Water."
3,an ok book,"I found this book to be very predictable,although entertaining. A very simple storyline that read very quickly. I must say, I too have been disappointed in Oprahs picks- she may want to educate people about the negativity in life, but she should stick to her talkshow regarding these subjects, and have more of a balance of education/entertainment books. Some suggestions: Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood/Rebecca Wells- Crazy In Alabama/Mark Childress- Angle of Repose/Wallace Stegner."
1,What was I thinking?!!!,I should have known!!The book was predictable and could have been done in 100 pages. Suffice it to say that I'm never buying another book that Oprah recommends.
4,It's a cozy read...,"I read the Pilot's wife in just a few hours. It is a fast, cozy read. I did want to mention that during the scenes in which Katheryn finds out about her husband's past, the book evoked a sadness for Katheryn and outrage at her husband's actions. It isn't often that I read a book that does that, and I give the credit to the author."
2,Very disappointing,"No, not all women write because they are angry at men. However, I don't want to defend all of womankind in this space! I read this book because I had read from sources other than the Oprah circuit that this was an interesting and original book. However, I was not impressed with it at all. The writing felt self conscious and clunky and I did not feel any sympathy for the main character. I realized at the end that I had not even formed a mental picture of the husband and couldn't imagine his life at all before the plane crashed. Blah is all I have to say. Next time I'll pick up a Guy Vanderhaeghe novel and breathe a sigh of relief as I am swept into an engaging and well written story."
4,An emotionally rich read!,"I am a person whose empathy is easily elicited, so I was completely engaged in the emotional roller-coaster ride of Kathryn Lyons. What I found unique in this book was the in-depth depiction of Lyons' emotional responses, first to the news of her husband's death, and then to the subsequent revelations as they came to light....The only reason I didn't give this book a 5-star rating is that the plot is a bit too contrived."
4,Kept me reading,"I have enjoyed several of Anita Shreve's books, but so far I think this is the best. I am a mystery reader and am usually disappointed when I can figure out all the secrets right away, but even though I could do that with this book, there was so much more going on than just finding out the secrets that I couldn't put the book down.In response to another reader's letdown that a romance between the wife and Robert wasn't pursued, I would say that most people who are grief-stricken and confused wouldn't turn to another person within days of their spouse's death. I think this is a Hollywood construct."
1,Ugh.,"Ugh. Helpless female character's life is ruined by husband's actions, only after he goes down in fatal plane crash. I think Shreve meant to write her heroine as a strong, inquisitive, contemporary woman, but I only read her as bumbling and ordinary. This book came highly recommended from a trusted friend (her name is not Oprah), but I have no desire to pick up another Shreve book again. Sorry!"
3,Enjoyable Read,This novel was easy to read and enjoyable. It started off fast so it wasn't long and drawn out. There are a few surprising turns that catch you offguard and it will make you think about your husband a little more!
4,Betrayal,"To me, this book had strong feelings of betrayal in a marriage that is falling apart...Too bad Jack didn't have the guts to tell Kathryn how he felt about her 5 years prior. Would have interesting to see more clear cut motives stated instead of hazy verbiage. However, if you have been in this situation it does pull some strings."
2,Too easy to predict,"I did like this book-it was an easy read and Shreve writes well. Although she tries to keep you guessing, I knew what was going to happen in the end. The book did pull my heart strings a couple of times, though."
4,Instant Page Turner,"This novel depicts our most horrific nightmare- Deceit. What is worse than losing a loved one? I was intrigued after reading the first page, and this continued until the end. Shreve did a perfect job of captivating my emotions with her detailed descriptions of the protagonists feelings and thoughts. The details were so realistic that I could picture the events and characters when I was not even reading. I send this novel a thumbs up; however, at the same time if you are not careful the twists and turns of what Kathryn uncovers can leave you synical about trust and life."
2,Dud ending,"An interesting read, but what a dud ending. The author got sidetracked on boring issues. I wish she focused more on the husband's secret life."
3,Entertaining and interesting,"I was at the bookstore at O'Hare and needed an easy read for my trip. Even if the story is implausible and predictable I had a hard time putting it down. In particular, there's something very haunting about Katherine's husband. The author never really offers a good explanation for his actions and that didn't really bother me. From personal experience, I've found that there are people that you think you know well and then discover hidden, sometimes disturbing things about them.If your looking for a more complex, inspiring book, I'd avoid The Pilot's Wife. But for a simple, ""formula"" story to pass the time, I thought this ws fine. Better written than most Harlequin Romances."
2,Where's the ending?,"Would someone please Email me the ending to this otherwise interesting novel? Unfortunately my edition of the book ends at the bottom of p. 293 with the words, I just wondered about the children, she said across the sea. ..... ? ? ....And the next page is blank. Obviously there is more that the printers left out, and I would appreciate knowing what it is. Help, someone, help!"
3,Not enough beef where it counts,"The book had an engaging plot, but as mentioned above, character development was lacking, especially in Mattie and Julia. Mattie's character was an insult to teens everywhere, with her unbelievably selfish nature and tendency to go spastic at any moment. The style was over-descriptive and I found myself skipping the tedious descriptions of places."
1,Too boring and repetitive language,"Boy, what a waste of time this book was. Totally predictable and very slow moving. I agree, hardly any action ...the good part was that it was short. You can finish this book in less than a week! But, do yourself a favor...don't waste your money on this one. I can't believe Oprah would have put this one on her book club."
4,Who could possibly put this book down?,"I just have to put in my two cents worth about this novel because I REALLY enjoyed reading it. The vivid imageries I pictured from Ms. Shreve's superb writing style were almost too real! This is an easy to read book and it will keep you entertained. The emotions of the main character are conveyed perfectly and you almost understand exactly how she feels. I loved this novel and have given it to my mom and my best friend to read as well. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that I didn't particularly like the ending. Pick it up, you won't be sorry you took this emotional voyage :)"
5,why do people hate it?,"I loved the book so much! There was great detail, and although it was a little expected, there were interesting twists. I read it in one sitting coming from paris, and couldn't put it down even if I wanted to! I don't see why people hate it, considering it is so good. Keep up the good work, Oprah!"
4,A good weekend book.,"I found this book very enjoyable and hard to put down. True, it did not change my life but it was a nice diversion."
3,"NOT REALISTIC, BUT A GOOD READ",Having two spouses on diffferent continents is not something I ever thought about...but found plausible and the interesting part of the book. The rest of it was quite unbelievable...but a good read.
3,Very predictable,As you read along- you could quickly figure out exactly how things were going to unravel. You were also left unsatisifed b/c there was not enough development of the pilot's character to understand him and why he did the things that he did.
3,A very easy read.,"With all the hype surrounding this book I expected more substance. The characters were given good introductions, but the overall plot was predictable, far-fetched and ridiculous at times. If you are looking for an easy read that doesn't require a high-level of concentration, then this is the book for you."
3,Entertaining confronting and enjoyable,"I did not read any reviews let alone read the back cover of this book as I didn't want to have any of the plot given away. By doing this I found it very enjoyable. It took me on a journey of discovery about myself and my own emotions. I thought it was well written. After one chapter closed I didn't want to go back to the past but once reading about the past wanted the story to continue further. For me it was a ""can't wait for bedtime reading"" book. Thanks O for the suggestion."
1,"Ending too abrupt, unbelievable characters",This book was assigned for our book discussion group and I wonder how the six of us will find anything to say about it for more than five minutes. I was disappointed in the typographical errors and I am pretty sure there were pages missing because locales changed with no sequence or logic. What happened to Muire's two children? Who was Kathryn talking to on the phone on the last page?
1,"Would have been better as a ""Redbook"" short story","Interesting, yes, but also massively predictible, and over before I knew it. Hardly worth the money. Oprah, what were you thinking?"
2,Predictable....Easy to read...,"The Pilot's Wife was not as great a book as I thought it would be. I bought it after reading the summary on the back cover and I though it was going to be a good read. You can really predict what will happen next or how she was going to find out about her husband. It somewhat has some realism put into it but then, probably only a few can relate to what happened and how it happened to Kathryn. I love the cover though!!!"
2,"It was an OK book,did not deserve all the hype","For a book on Oprah's book list, I was disappointed. It was just a ho-hum romance, and a little on the depressing side. But an easy read."
2,"A quick, easy read but very similar to a soap opera","The question how well do we really know someone isn't particulaly relevent to the novel. The question should really be, how naive do we let ourselves be? I didn't think that it was a huge shock that Kathryn didn't know about her husbands double life. Based on the flashbacks that Shreve provides in every other chapter it was clear that Kathryn's marriage was falling apart and she jsut didn't want to face the truth. Furthermore, the novel is one of the most predictable I've ever read. The whole question of how real we really know someone is a good one. Unfortunately, it is not well presented in this case. The whole idea of leading a double life with another family is trite and similar to an episode of Dynasty or All My Children."
4,Exciting read,I enjoyed reading this book. It is an easy read and each chapter leaves you with a need to read the next. The book makes you wonder if you ever really know the person whom you live and share you life with.
2,Dry as Dust,Please give me a break! Could this book have moved along any slower and been any more depressing. My advice- Skip it!
1,Flat characters in a boring plot,"I was very disappointed with this book. I found it impossible to like or care about the characters who had no depth. And the plot was very predictable. There are so many wonderful books being written, I'm appalled that this is the best thing Oprah could find to recommend and make into a best-seller. Other people who bought it must feel as cheated as I did."
2,Lightweight,"I ordered The Triumph and the Glory and The Pilot's Wife to find out for myself what all of the fuss was about. The Triumph and the Glory was terrific, a truly stunning novel. The Pilot's Wife was very mediocre, a lightweight effort, I can't believe Anita Shreve wrote it, she is usually brilliant. Boring plot, wooden characters, a trip to nowhere with no particular enjoyment on the way there."
4,The best read in quite a while,"I loved this book! It is not often a novel can sustain my attention, but this one kept me guessing and enchanted. By the way Helen....how many books have you written dear?? Try not to take things so seriously. This was a wonderful piece of ""creative writing"". Exactly what a fictional novel should be."
3,Pilot's Wife,"Kathryn Nolan receives word that her pilot husband was killed in a crash, killing many other passengers as well. His story is flashed on the News along with suspicions that it was suicide. Kathryn is devastated by the turn of events and can hardly stand the accusations. She cannot understand how this could happen to her and Jack, since their relationship was so idealistic. The majority of the book was spent by Kathryn agonizing over Jack's death and how she can make peace with it. When she finds out that Jack led another life in England, the story changes and she begins to understand the subtle clues that he left along the way."
2,The pilot's wife,I think the word i would use to best describe this book is OKAY. It was not great and it was not horrible. It was very slow starting for me. I thought the premise of the story was quite interesting but somehow it just fell a little flat.
3,Writing style a bit much,"The plot of this book was engaging, but I found the writing style ""oppressive"". There was something about it that felt very ""self-conscious"" and a little too flowery or sentimental for me. I also, for some reason, just could not resonate with the main character. It held my interest, but I have definitely read better books I've enjoyed much more."
2,Slow and Predictable,"There were only two chapters in the book that kept my attention. The rest of the book I had to push myself through to read. I felt the characters were strange, yet predictable. In fact, the story line is what I expected in the first few chapters. This is not the first Oprah book I didn't care for, however it was part of a book club I belonged to, so I gave it my best shot. I felt it was boring."
4,Unbalanced...but decently written,"3.5 stars. This too was my first Shreve book and I admit the first half of the book is this wonderfully well written emotional piece and then it's as if someone else wrote the last act. After the second family was revealed and the pilot's other secrets rise to the surface, I start to cock my head to the side like my chocolate labador in confusion. I'm suddenly reading the amazing mis-adventures of a daredevil polygamist. The story becomes wholly unbelievable in a pre 9/11 world."
3,"Beautifully written, but very disturbing story","I've read most of Oprah's book picks, and this one was certainly less depressing than most of her suggestions, but it was very disturbing nonetheless. I found it quite upsetting that you could live with someone for so many years and not have a clue that he was leading a totally separate life. The book is beautifully written, though, and impossible to put down. I read it in a day!"
2,A lesser read than previous picks,"I was rather disappointed by The Pilot's Wife. I had grown accustomed to a certain level of literature from the Oprah picks. The Pilot's Wife read more like Danielle Steele than a quality read. I found it predictable, and undeveloped."
3,"Interesting story, fast-paced, disappointing in parts","I just finished reading Oprah's latest book pick and thought that it was a pretty good book. From the first page to the last page my interest was tightly held. I was a bit disappointed that the author did not go more into detail about Kathryn's relationship with Mattie; I definitely wanted to know more, especially after Kathryn found out about Jack's secret past. I question whether Kathryn does the right thing by not telling Mattie what she learns. The story does make a person think about how well do we know the people in our lives. By the way, Oprah's ultimate goal is to get people to read; she never claims that the books she chooses are the absolute very best ever written!"
2,"Not bad, but there are better books.","It is an 'okay' book, but there are so many true accounts of brave and wonderful women who flew dangerous and unproven aircraft during WWII and after, that I don't see why this novel about a pilot's wife should garner such attention. My advice is to skip it, and pick up a non-fiction account of actual women pilots. I'd especially recommend Haynsworth's ""Amelia Earhart's Daughters"" or Van Keil's ""Those Wonderful Women and Their Flying Machines."""
5,"Set aside a long, cozy evening for this great book!","Even a person in the most trusting of relationships sometimes wonders what their significant other ""might"" be up to. Fortunately for most of us, the clandestine activity is usually something harmless, like an expensive pair of new shoes bought on the sly or a night out with the boys that goes on just a bit too long. But what about the times when the secret isn't so innocuous? Writer Anita Shreve takes that premise and tells a gripping, heart-rending tale of a wife who finds out just what her beloved husband was up to. Don't be scared away if you think this is a sad book, it is, but the ending is terrific and uplifting! Shreve is a super writer and I've also read THE WEIGHT OF WATER by her (that is from the same publisher, Back Bay Books in case you are wondering) and I loved that too. Get to know this great writer!"
3,THE PILOT'S WIFE IS A GOOD READ,"To take my mind off my fear of flying on a flight from Denver to Atlanta I focused all my attention on this latest Oprah pick, and it provided an engrossing read that left me quite satisfied that I'd read a well written story. (I was also gratefully distracted from a rather turbulent flight--I thank the author for this!) It wasn't the greatest book I had ever read, and it read like a well written report... rather like the kind you'd see portrayed in a hour long special report on TV. The character development was tight and the ending satisfying. Again, not the best Oprah pick, but a good book is a good book. I also recommend Joseph Green's ""Pseudo Cool"" for those wanting for a fast and interesting read that projects a powerful story. Looking forward to Oprah's next pick!"
2,Predictable schmaltz,"I recognize that there are good elements to this book: it's obvious that Anita Shreve knows how to write, and it was easy to imagine scenes and characters from her descriptions. It was the STORY that stunk. It was a boring, obvious, predictable story that only a Harlequin reader would have been entranced by. ..."
4,The Pilot's Wife: A Novel,"I could not put this book down! Although I figured out what might happen, I was somewhat suprised at the twist regarding the other woman's political involvement and how Robert got involved with her and the danger so whole heartedly. I felt sad and mad at how much of himself he did not share with Katheryn, she deserved more. This was a good book, it made me think about relationships in my own life."
2,Barely worth the effort,"Although I was interested enough to finish the story, I felt it had been a waste of time when it was over. Everything happened so conveniently. It was highly predictable and a little too neatly concluded. Really not worth the effort."
2,kind of duh,"I just finished this book 2 days ago, and I've already forgotten most of it. (whereas I read SHE'S COME UNDONE alomst a year ago, and it's still fresh). That should tell you something. This book is not only silly, it is predictable, and trite. I felt as though I'd seen or heard this story somewhere before, only better told. The character of the other wife (see, I can't even remember her name) was a joke. So she loved Jack-- big deal. Wouldn't she at least insist on him getting a divorce? The only good thing about the novel was that the author (what's her name again?) avoided bringing Robert and Kathryn together in a romantic way in the end. That would have been the ultimate in cheese, and would have cost my review the one star that sets it up from torture."
1,What a disappointment,"I generally enjoy SOME of Oprah's books, but this one was definitely a poor choice. The plot, which is all one can focus on because the style isn't particularly inventive or interesting, drags along from beginning to end. I was praying for the predictable ending. When it came, I felt nothing for the characters involved."
1,Caution,"Actual pilot wives should not read this book! It centers on situations that are very real but very unpleasant to think about. A pilot's wife would not consider reading about a woman dealing with these issues entertainment. However, the book is really well written."
4,"""a pure and undiluted happiness""","...that (above) is a line from Anita Shreve's book in describing Kathryn's feelings when she was a young woman newly in love with her husband. I loved that line(obviously) as she writes this novel beautifully and poignantly. There are some things that annoyed me(such as the situation with Jack's mother; I don't feel that mystery was explained well enough) but in general, this was a very interesting story and very enjoyable to read. There is a wide range of emotions felt throughout,along with an element of suspense, but leaves you with a peaceful feeling."
1,Extremely disappointing.,"I don't understand the best seller lists... Incredibly boring characters, bland settings, repetitive language. The most mildly interesting character was the pilot, and he was dead..."
1,maudlin -- to much interior dialogue and not much action,"I found this book very disappointing. The only fully fleshed out character is Kathryn; I never felt I knew Julia, Robert or Jack. Too much time was spent on interior memories and monologues; I didn't care for the device of switching back and forth to ""splinters of memories""."
3,not a bad book,"I expected more from this book, however it is better than anything produced by Johnny Dull'em (the one whose books get turned into big movies)"
2,Felt like it was deja vous,"I enjoyed this book, but I have to say that I felt like the story really wasn't that original. I felt like I'd read it or watched it somewhere before. The storyline was predictable. I could tell where it was going & was not at all surprised by what Kathryn finds out about her husband's other life. If you're looking for a light read, then this book is okay."
2,CBS Movie of the Week,"We've all heard or read about this scenario: pilot with wives in city A, B, C and more. This isn't such a new concept and so I found the plot was a bit borring. Yea, I wish I were a pilot so I could have multiple families, or at least wifes in different cities. But, the ""why"" - is not fully addressed. She makes an attempt at the end, but give up without really trying, just asking the questions. The book is great in its description of a spouse learning of the sudden death of the other, but lacks in any detail as to why the husband would do what he did. The writing was tight and you moved through the book fast. Maybe no - one knows why this happens but the book makes you think.It's on Oprha's list so read it and you'll have something to talk about at cocktail parties."
2,The Pilot's Wife,"This is a light read and an okay book if you don't have anything else to do. I have a problem, however, with books where you can anticipate each step of the way before you get there. Maybe that comes from having read too many accounts of situations like this in real life.Writing is not easy, and getting a story to the point of publication is even more difficult. So I have given this book two stars for the effort and tenacity of the author."
2,Why do I care?,"I started to read this book awhile ago, but couldn't get through it. So, I picked it up again when I needed something to read while I wait. Some of the descriptions were long and tedious. I thought the author was too caught up in the language and didn't put enough energy into keeping the story going."
5,On the edge of my seat,"This book was full of twists and turns. Just when you thought you knew what would happen, Shreve changed everything around and you were left wondering ""What's next?"" I would highly recommend this book to all women to read, especially those who are wives and mothers. I could really identify with the lead character and her situation, even though I've never experienced what she went through. It almost sounds like it could've been a true story. Not too far-fetched to seem real. Great read!!!"
1,"Predictable With A Capital ""P""","I couldn't believe how predictable this novel turned out to be! From the very beginning, the plot seemed to move along without any real help from the author. Any reader with half an imagination can figure out what will happen within the first chapter. I do think that this book has potential, though. The whole concept of ""really knowing another person"" is one that could be explored in depth and worked into a captivating and original plot. That's what I thought Shreve would do with this novel, but I was disappointed."
1,OPRAH RECOMMENDING RUBBISH LIKE THIS NOW?,"This was the worst book I read this year. It was at about the same level as a Harlequin Romance novel. The story was ridiculous, predictable and totally stupid. This book was really bad! There was no character development -- nothing of interest. I can't believe that Oprah would recommend a book like this!"
4,If you wondering what it's like to be married to a pilot...,"Having been a pilot's wife for almost 16 years, I found this novel both stunningly realistic, and outrageously ridiculous. Kathryn's internal monologue the night Robert shows up on her doorstep to reveal the news is chillingly accurate...I don't know a pilot's wife who hasn't run this scenario through her head a million times and wondered how she would take her ever next breath if it ever really happened. We all have had late-christmases, postponed birthdays, and the vague feeling that we are always being left behind. I often tease my husband about having ""another wife"" in Detroit (his base)when forgets if he has told me something, but Jack actually did! I'm not sure what kind of ending this book had. Like so many others, I was left with an empty, confused feeling. Maybe a sequel is pending? One thing is for sure, Ms. Shreve spoke to airline people before writing this book. Definitely worth reading, but buy the paperback not the hard-cover."
3,"I enjoyed it, even though I knew how it would end","I read this book in one day, which is unusual for me. I really don't know why - I did not develop a great deal of empathy for any of the characters and I had a pretty good idea by the middle of the book how it was all going to turn out (short of a few details, I was right). I guess that is why I kept reading, to see whether or not I had it all figured out!Anyway, not a bad book, not a great book, but a fairly pleasant, easy read. Certainly not as depressing as some of the Oprah picks."
5,"A good story , told in vivid detail.",Perhaps this is a book more suited for women readers. It kept me interested and engaged from first page to last.
3,"Good book, enjoyable reading.","Interesting, though somewhat boring towards middle of book. Surprising ending."
3,I loved it at first and then became disinterested,"When I first started this book I was hooked, it was a total page-turner. I loved the first half of the book and couldn't wait to read it. Toward the second half of the book I became bored and lost compassion for the situation. It became ""contrived"" and too dramatic for me."
2,"Not well written, very predictable","I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed by The Pilot's Wife. It was not particularly well written (I was ready to scream with her ""he said, she said"") and the story was all too predictable.I am very surprised that Oprah and Amazon recommended this mediocre book"
3,Wonderfully written but was looking for more of a mystery,"I felt that this novel was wonderfully written. The details that were given by the author helped you to really begin to know the characters. However, I was longing for more mystery within the storyline. It seemed that the main character just happened to stumble upon her discovery rather than gradually finding the truth."
2,I felt very unsympathetic for every character in this book.,"I, too, felt amazement that this is one of Oprah's book club recommendations. Not a single character made me feel connected in any way. In addition, I felt that the plot developments were incredibly implausible."
1,"Very disappointing, predictable, ordinary",I found virtually nothing in this book to make me want to recommend it to anyone. It was so predictable and ordinary. I didn;t care about the characters and I kept waiting for something to happen to deepen or enrich the story.......never happened. A waste of my time and money.
2,Another entry from Oprah's catalogue of women's suffering,"The reviews were misleading. This was purile, predictable and ultimately boring. Oprah, this is the last book with your recommendation that I will ever purchase."
2,so predictable,"i wasn't used to this author when i read this book so i didn't know what to expect. now my perception of shreve's writing style is not great. there was a lot detail focused on the story's environment, instead of on the story itself. one can see the next step coming from a mile away. i rated it with 2 stars b/c 1 star seemed unnecessarily ruthless. but hey, it's all subjective anyway: some readers loved it."
4,strong emotions....,I just finished this book and was amazed at how the writer was able to capture the emotions and put them into words. I felt like it was me who was going through this terrible tragedy. I would wake at night with a terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach. Never has a book captured my soul as much as this one.
2,A Made For TV Movie,The writing is painfully ordinary and slow. Human curiosity made me want to find out the ending. Nothing more.
2,not realistic whatsoever,"I just couldn't believe the things that occurred in this novel....they were too **outrageous**(?) The prose on pain and emotional suffering was well written, but still a slow book. If your time is precious, this is not a book to leave you feeling satisfied."
1,Probably the worst book I've ever read,"I think my subject line says it all. I forced myself to finish the entire book, thinking it would get better or have a great ending. It was boring, predictable, and frustrating. Kathryn was a weak and annoying woman, and I didn't find myself caring about her character at all. I also didn't like how every other chapter would alternate between present and past...so cheesy. Terrible ending!"
4,Very Good but dissapointed,The book was really good and it was fast paced and I whizzed right through it but when it came to the end I was really dissapointed. It ended too quick and I wanted more out of the ending.
4,The Pilot's Wife,"This book goes above and beyond the expectation of a novel. It is fantastic. Anita Shrieve uses magnificient imagery in this story to create a compelling emotion. By doing this she pulls you into the story. The imagery that she uses makes you feel a part of the story. The metaphor within this book is about how well you think you know a person. It's like when eating an apple you know what it's going to taste like, then one day it surprises you because it doesn't taste like that at all. You realize that you may not really know people like you think you do. Shrieve does an excellent job of making you feel like you are a part of the novel."
1,"Boring, dry, and uneventful - don't bother reading this one","I read the book on a flight from Dallas to DC. I finished it only in hopes that something exciting would happen, but nothing did. The writing was dry and flavorless. Oprah usually does a better job at picking them."
