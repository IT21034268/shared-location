5,"A Refreshing Look at God, Faith, Love and Media","Don't be fooled by the subject matter - an ex-monk, who can heal the sick by touching them, but suffers stigmata each time, gets caught up in a whirl of religious fanatics, big-business evangelists and ratings-hungry media - this is a sweet and touching romantic comedy! Leave it to Paul Schrader to find a way to do some heavy soul-searching without getting heavy-handed, yet always remaining quirky as we know him from his dramas. A wonderful supporting cast (Christopher Walken, Tom Arnold, Janeane Garofalo, Lolita Davidovich and Gina Gershon) adds color and texture to the story without detracting from the quiet chemistry going on between Skeet Ulrich and Bridget Fonda. When Ulrich says without grandeur that he believes in God and miracles, you don't even think twice about it - you believe every word he says at face value. A rare performance."
4,interesting film,I'm a skeet ulrich fan and i LOVED him in this role and he looked so angelic.this is a trippy little film that i found very interesting as well as the comments it makes on society and religion.and how can you go wrong with christopher walken??
5,Touched by Touch,"This movie was excellent. It didn't scream out the hypocrisy of the church it whispers it into submission. Skeet Ulrich plays Juvenal a young man who devoted himself to God and was gifted with the Touch to heal. He lives a sheltered life and works his gift in the humblest of ways until the media and church find out and do their best to exploit him. Juvenal's character is humble, kind, forgiving, insightful, and everything you would expect a true religious person to be. He chooses not to sell God, but to experience God which creates a yet continued misunderstanding in the church where they wish to make him fit their ideas causing him for a short time to lose the gift. This is an awesome film for anyone who loves God but hates/dislikes/pities the ignorance of the Church. Watch it, buy it, love it! Peace!"
4,Touch me,"I liked this film. It's the story of a young man who has a special healing ""touch"" that causes stigmata, bleeding from the body where Jesus also bled from his crucifixion(hands, feet, and side). Juvenal(Skeet Ulrich)is the main character. He has no idea why this happens to him and truly wishes it wouldn't. He does like healing people, though, which toughens his dilemma. I also read the book by Elmore Leonard. What impresses me mostly about this movie is how closely Skeet Ulrich portrays the main character--right down to the clothes he wears. His softness and shyness comes to life on the screen. I want this movie on DVD and soon. FLIX has it for rental, but I want to buy it."
5,Awesome music maker!,We love musical instruments and especially tambourines. This one is easy to hold and durable. My kids love to play with it (when I haven't hidden it due to noise overload).
1,Why Smallville?,"I agree with Joshua Koppel's review... there is nothing here to advance the Smallville storyline. This could have been a Hardy Boys mystery. I'm not saying the story itself is bad, I was just terribly disappointed that it was such a generic mystery story and could have been plopped in any series with some character name changes. The only thing special I remember Clark doing was using some X-ray vision a couple of times and bringing Chloe a cup of coffee at superspeed. ""City"" is a much better read, it is much more Smallville than this book."
3,WhoDunnit?,"Based on the WB's hit series. Clark, Lana, and Chloe search for a missing friend, but instead find an entire family murdered. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor's father is abducted. Neither Clark's superpowers nor Lex's wealth can help in either case. Original."
3,Ehh,Not what I expected but this is not to say that this is a bad pedal. I just happen not to be able to use it for the sound that I need to achieve. Sold it to the other guitarist in the band and it sounds wicked on his Peavy 6501+.
2,TENNESSEE ERNIE FORD/AMAZING GRACE,"A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT.THIS VIDEO IS A ""KULTUR"" RELEASE AND DEFINATELY NOT UP TO THE STANDARDS OF A GAITHER PRODUCT.THERE ARE APPROX.SEVEN SONGS LISTED ON THE BOX THAT WERE ABSENT ON THE VIDEO.THIS VIDEO WAS NEW WHEN I OPENED IT TO PLAY.WHY GAITHER EVER CONSENTED TO AFFIX HIS NAME AND LOGO ON THIS PRODUCTION,I'LL NEVER KNOW..THANKS...ARTHUR W"
2,Not Very Complete,Wish I could have more specifics about the care and feeding of guinea fowl and keets. This book seems to be based on information in England. I don't think most applies to the USA.
5,An Excellent Work,I read the Federalist Papers before I read this book and was convinced that the Constitution was a wonderful document. Then I heard the other side. It turns out that the Anti-Federalists were right...in most cases. The book greatly added to my understanding of the Constitution and the change that occurred in our government when we left the Articles of Confederation behind. I was left wondering whether we should have simply modified the Articles rather than embracing a consolidated government. I only wish the Anti-Federalists had won the debate about taxation. It was foolish to give the federal government the power of unlimited taxation.
2,They Didn't Last Long,"I bought a set of the old fashioned (rocks) glasses for my dad last January and when I went to visit him last month, he had ONE left. He said they were too delicate and broke easily (mom backed him up on that). He used them for his evening martini on the rocks. Maybe they'd last longer if you only brought them out for special occasions. But what's the fun in that?!?"
2,Great Glasses but Extremely fragile.,As mentioned before. Beautiful glassware just very delecate.I have 2 of my 4 left as they started to chip around the edges.
4,Cover explains it all,I bought this book for a college class (West Coast Baptist COllege). The book covers how to deal with people in many different scenario settings. It's a little dry (great for a college classroom) but would serve as a great quick reference guide.
1,"Do NOT buy this book, it STINKS!!","I have never become so angry reading a book about my home as I became while reading this one. The book is full of insults and frankly,lies! I actually wonder if Mr.Pariser has visited the island. He put down everything,(even ""the poor food"")and made it seem like we are a miseducated, inferior people. His comments on how women are treated was so far from the truth it was almost hilarious. I have lived on this island all my life (in Mayaguez), and have yet to see a naked little boy running around, I am a devout Catholic and as many times as I have attended Mass, I NEVER witnessed any sort of ""african ritual"" during it. This book is the biggest waste of money ever, it would be better spent sending Mr. Pariser to Puerto Rico, so he could go, learn, and get to know its people, its beauty and everything that makes it ""La Isla Boriquen"". I gave it one star because zero stars was not an option."
3,Beware of the Maps!,"Pariser's book is full of interesting trivia, and directs you to most of the major attractions of the island, but don't count on his maps to get you around outside of San Juan. For one, the detail maps aren't shown in relation to major highways. In Ponce, for example, the map only reveals the inner city, with no indication of how to get from Rte. 2 to the streets listed (actually, it's quite easy in retrospect, but not if you rely on the book). Also, the restaurant listings for the Southwest were very sparse, as were such facts as ""if you visit the historical area in Ponce at night, you will be the only tourists, everything will be closed, and there are no restaurants in the area."" Otherwise, an enjoyable and informative book."
2,"Looks good, wears out fast","Purchased for my 70 pound lab mix. The metal grommet hole reinforcers wear out very quickly (I use this for putting Jack out on a tie-out in the backyard, and a choker for walking). I shifted to three different holes because the metal reinforcers fall out. Today Jack actually got loose completely while he was outback drying off from a bath. The hole tore down the collar about two inches, allowing him to slip out. A neighbor brought him back to us, but naturally the concern remains. I recommend a leather collar for stronger dogs, this one doesn't cut it for medium-large dogs."
1,A hard read..,"Book is written in raw language, which is not very pleasant to read. While it gives out a lot of facts I did not enjoy reading it and it made assimilating those facts harder."
2,An Okay Book But Not A Great One,"As a previous reviewer pointed out this is not a how to book but one that deals with changing one's attitude from being an employee to an entrepenur. While that's great for those who need it, this book doesn't really offer anything new to anyone who is already inclined to start an entrepenurial venture. I would reccomend any of Robert Kiyosaki's books for those who want to go into business for themselves. Considering the current and near term job market,I highly encourage others to consider this route."
2,Misleading Pricing. List price is not over $19.00.,"Product is fine, pricing is misleading.I purchased this in June 2009 when it said it was 87% off list price and is now $2.54 per case. I am happy to see that the description says a ""case"" is one cake. It said it was 12 cakes when I purchased it. At the time they graciously refunded my shipping but I still paid for quite pricey suet when Home Depot sells it for about $1.29 per cake.In any case, this produce would NEVER sell for $19.00 per ""cake"" hence an 87% discount is completely misleading and I hope no other buys make the mistake I did."
4,A little different flavor of Todd,A number of Todd's more popular songs in styles you never would have imagined. Different.
5,WONDERFUL !,"The best Cd of New Acoustic Music. The ROUND MIDNIGHT Mike's version is great like the original of ""Master"" T.Monk. All songs of this Cd are full of passion with the ""cream"" of acoustic musicians. I love it ! I have this one on Lp from many years and now I've this one on Cd. For me, I'm a mandolinist, this Cd is a ""bible"" . Very very super goooood !"
4,Fun for a child who likes action toys,"My friend's grandson was coming on the train to visit her, and he was VERY excited about the train ride--and to see Grandma, of course. At three and a half, he loves his toys that move and make noise, so I thought a wind-up train would be fun for him to bring along.Sure enough, he loved this ""Streamline Train"" and couldn't wait to show off the way it TURNS if you aim it the right way. Apparently a train going in a big arc is much more exciting that a train running straight across the room. Isn't that good to know?This little toy is good value for money. I'm sorry it's not available from Amazon at the moment but when it's restocked, you might want to think of the little ones in your life, who probably have plenty of toys with batteries, circuitry and software. Trains played an important part in the history of North America, and isn't it nice to see children getting in touch with our past as well as our future?Linda Bulger, 2010"
2,Buyer Beware,"It does not look durable at all, and is much smaller than i thought it would be. The child i'm given it to will still love it cause he loves trains, but i'd put money on him breakin it in less than a week."
5,perfect to start applying XP in a team!,"excellent book! and easy to read, very focus on people!I bought it for the team leader after reading it and she is loving it. we were already in the first steps of applying XP practices, but now she is in the right track"
3,Thorough Overview of Extreme Programming (XP),"""Extreme Programming Explained"" offers a thorough and good overview of the Extreme Programming (XP) approach to software development.This book covers the fundamentals of XP and describes some of the benefits of this approach to developing software. While this approach may not suit all developers, project managers or companies, this book offers an interesting overview of XP."
5,A must for all programmers,"Whether or not interested in Extreme Programming, a software developer should certainly read this book. As a warning, the book is not a detailed techinal guide of how to apply XP. It's more of a emotional guide of how to better ourselves as being a programmer. This book reminded me that, I am a human who have values and ideals, not just a machine, writing code only to make some money. If you have huge amount of technical knowledge and experience and still feeling something is wrong, this is the book which will enlighten your path."
3,Worth reading,"This is the book that started Agile. It's worth reading. The principles and practices are still darn good. It's nowhere near as good of a book as, for instance, TDD by Example, but it's important."
3,Tepid Tea,"The protagonist, Inspector Maybridge, is rather bland, treating suspects and sources gently. Most of the action, a series of murders and a suicide, occurs before Chapter One. A lot of the space in this rather short book (253 pocket size pages) is devoted to the study of supporting characters. The descriptions of character and setting are credible and well-written, but proceed slowly. The ending is brief but powerful and credible. A slow ride to a jolting conclusion."
5,Great,"Great item, did what it was said to do. Trapped a lot of tar and nicotine. Mine broke but it did work."
4,Neat Filter,"The filter is pretty nice, keeps it away from my face so I can leave it in my mouth as I smoke it. Its good for when I'm playing guitar or want to be hands off with my smoking experience. The draw on it is a little bit harder, and it starts to give a slightly metallic taste. I dont mind either of these things, unless I'm snacking or drinking something tasty. It'll ruin those flavors. Otherwise really nice! easy to clean too!"
5,Awesome,I love this filter. I love that it is reusable and is manufactured in the United States. I would definitely recommend to others!
2,Great Company Follow-Up,"I bought this system because of the great reviews. When I received it, I was excited to try it...did nothing. I smoke Marlboro Ultralight 100s and absolutely nothing came out when I inhaled. I cut the filter on my cigarette down, and still nothing. Help!!! I really would like to know what I'm doing wrong if anything.Since my last posted review, I was contacted by the company to assist me with my problem. They offered to replace the defective product and/or offered me samples of their disposable filters, at no cost to me. I opted for the disposables and love them. Nice to know that there are companies who truly care in client satisfaction. Thumbs up for the disposables and to the company."
1,Cannot clean,"Nice but disposable, cannot clean these, unless you soak in gas for a week. Tried everything, nothing worked until I soaked in Gas, and then threw them away due to the smell."
1,uhhh... am I missing something????,"This did not work at all!!! I opened the package and put it on the cigarette.... totally didn't fit. My cigarette slide right out! Stupid! I smoke regular sized cigarettes, (Marlboros Libght). This was really crap and I would like to return them, but it would probably be more to send it back than the actual product was worth. Really upset because I was hoping it would work... CRAP!"
5,F-ing brilliant!,"I love these, they work great, and don't ruin the taste at at all. I'm also happy that they're designed to be cleaned and reused, previously I've been trying to clean and reuse disposable type filters since that was all I had found and that doesn't work so well."
3,Not a permanent filter,"I bought two of these things. Cleaning it only removes part of the gunk, some of it just gets stuck. It gets to the point eventually that you can't even drag it anymore. This was the case with both of them. Just buy the disposables, because this is essentially a long lasting disposable. Besides, I think the disposables are more economic overall. Or you could just put your cigarette out because this thing just catches the tar/nicotine that'll be smoking on your next one anyway. It simply provides a smoother smoke, but if you just smoke 3/4 of a cigarette, it's basically the same thing, this thing just makes it smoother to smoke."
3,well.... it works,the thing about this is that it works it gets ridd of a ton of tar and gets really gross black tar buttt it very much restricts smoke and made me go back to regular analogs
4,Great for Parties,"Great for costume parties, this works great. Does not change the flavor, and comes with a black and clear filter in each pack. Easy to clean, light to hold."
2,Its allright i guess,"Doens't block tar as effectively as other products. Usually you can see tar after 2-3 PUFFs on competitive products, while on this one, its 2-3 cigarettes,. I tried to look at tar buildup in the filter after smoking 1-2 cigarettes, but it was hardly noticeable. I got one filter from china, generic one, and i took only one puff and 5 small dots of tar appeared inside the filter."
5,Best Pepper Grinder Available,You cannot do better than this pepper grinder. It is fantastic. I went through 4 or 5 grinders before going with this one and it is definitely worth the price!
1,Doesn't grind as advertised,I tried to get the pepper mill to get a coarse grind. I tried the suggestions in the reviews... Nothing worked and I sent it back.
4,Great mill for over the stove,I've had this pepper mill for over 10 years (in the copper) and it certainly is a workhorse! Never fails to produce copious amounts of pepper quickly. This is the mill I use whilst cooking at the stove as you can grind right over the pot/pan very quickly. As the body it tall you can also get a good grip as you turn the handle.It doesn't crack pepper but grind is medium course to fine. It also produces a lot of peper sp I don't generally use it at the table.The only downside is that the copper coating eventually tarnishes but only in spots as the varnish coating wears away. They should have dispensed with the coating in my opinion. In any case I'm getting another in the chromed finish as a gift for a friend.
5,Awesome,I have had several peppermills however after using this one those other peppermills should not even be called that. This mill outputs a lot of pepper with minimal effort an it also looks great. Well worth the money.
2,So Close...,"The book is a good one, and it possesses the mother-load of information to be expected from a Slackware Book. Unfortunately, the book spends much to much time on advanced topics that noobs have very little information on. It talks about Advanced Perl scripting, when the user only wants to know how to use different fonts.Not for noobs.Then again, slackware never was. :D"
2,its Slack -- not much else to say,Actually ... this one had a bit of disappointment going into all the gui / motif programming; but that's partially due to the year it was printed ...but also ... it was written by someone who's proud to be affiliated with SCO ... but times were different when this was written so I won't judge it on that ... but i've also put this one on the back-burner just to due to the way SCO has treated the development community in whole ... so its hard to give any opinion of this
4,Well rounded and good introduction to Linux,This book is well rounded and contains many examples and options. It comes with lots of software(although some outdated) and provides a great stepping stone to Linux and Unix Operating Systems. I would recommend it for the begginer and even the casual user. It also has a good manual that covers basic utilities that are used every day.
5,A very good book I think the best part is it's for everyone,Slackware is a great os and this book shows you how you will make Slackware run at peak preformance and show to you that the worlds highest price and most baught virus win 9* is such a piece of crap. Buy this book now you will not be sorry you did. Power to the Penguin The_Phreaker
5,Way cool book!!!,"I agree with the last review except for one thing: You are not the only 14-yr-old girl who likes Star Wars!! My best friend and I are both 14 (and girls!) and we love SW!!This WAS one of the best Young Jedi Knights, and it was good that Zekk finally turned from the Dark Side. Plus, Jacen and Jaina are always cool. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes SW and Jacen and Jaina Solo."
5,Five Stars,"In the Lost Ones Jacen and Jaina return to Courscant and are excited to see Han, Leia, Anakin and their friend Zekk who lives on the streets. Things aren't exactly the same though Zekk sees how much his friends have changed and how they have a future ahead of him and he has nothing. The Dark Jedi Brakiss is also on Courscant to find new recruits for his Shadow Academy including Zekk. Can Jacen and Jaina save Zekk from the Shadow Academy? Once again another great book in the Young Jedi Knights."
3,Good but missing something.,"While I did like this book there was a glaring ommission as far as I am concerned. Years before writing this book or the other Young Jedi Knight books Mr. Anderson wrote three full length novels telling about the formation of the Jedi Academy. However with a threat to the Academy by an army of dark jedi Luke makes on call for help to the older knights. No Kyp Durron, no Kenth Hammer, no Cilgal. The only two are Luke and Tionne. It is one thing to forget other author's work, but not your own. Shame on you Mr. Anderson. I would have given four stars but because of this it only gets three."
5,The best,"This book is one of the best Young Jedi Knights books. (if you liked this one you will probably like Shards of Alderaan) I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It is very funny, especially when Zekk eats the bouquet! If you were a Classic Star Wars fan, this one's good for you because both Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo make apperances. (Even though Luke Skywalker is in all of them, or almost all of them.)"
5,Every book is the best!,"Dear Readers, These books are absolutely Star Wars. Every book in the ""Young Jedi Knights"" series is a page turner, and they always leave you hungry for more. If want ""Star Wars"" read these books and you'll have it! P.S. (My definition of ""Star Wars"" is: The Greatest!)"
4,It is a good book.,This is a very good book. It was very intresting. I will be sure to get the next book.
4,Fun and exciting!,"This is one of the most exciting books I've ever read. One part I especially liked was when Tionne and her students lifted a slab of marble over the Dark Jedi. Also, this has been one of the most disappointing books I've read because the Emperor ended up being a fake holographic image"
5,The best of the Jedi Academy,"I liked this book alot. It was action-packed, suspense filled, and still managed to put in a good deal with the emotions of the characters. My only regret is that it could've spent more time on the battle between Zekk and Jaina, and spent a little more time on its outcome. It also left something to be desired about the adventures of Jacen, Tenel-Ka, Lowie, and Shadow Academy. It is definitely the best of the series so far"
2,Not that good,"This was quite a disappointment. The idea of a series about a thrashy Hollywood celebrity magazine was good but it does not succeed. On the one hand it has a way too hard edge without being really realistic. It dwells on the lives of not that interesting and unsympathetic actors thourgh the eyes of an extremely hardened editor played by Courteney Cox. The role of this aggressive, foul-mouthes and ambitious editor does not suit her. The problem is that after a pilot episode that was dreadful it does get somewhat better with the exception of her schizophrenic photographer friend. This could and should have been thrasy fun instead."
2,No viene subtitulada en español,"Yo la compre porque en la pagina decia que venia subtitulada y nada de nada, asique aqui la tengo, que lo unico que he podido ver a sido la caratula."
5,dirt,"okay, so it's trashy, and it lays bare all the tabloid nonsense we like to pretend we despise. but hey, isn't that the point of TV? personally, i find the show completely addictive. this show entertains in rich color and witty dialog. i think the cast is amazing- courtney cox is a cold and compelling star, and don is totally endearing as a co. willa is wonderfully wicked, holt gorgeously indecisive, julia, ah how you'll love to hate her. and hey, if you don't want to watch a show about a tabloid, don't watch it! but if you do, i think you'll agree you're hooked after one episode. it's just good entertainment!"
1,**BEWARE** SERIOUS FLAWS ON THE DVD's!!!!!!!,"WHEN THIS DVD WAS DONE SERIOUS FLAWS EXIST IN THE MASTER. I TOOK BACK 2 SETS BEFORE GIVING UP. 3 DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS OF DIFFERENT MAKES AND AGES, NONE UNDER $200 AND THE SAME JUMPS, SKIPS, EVEN SPOTS WHERE THE TRACKING OF SOUND DOESN'T LINE UP WITH THE VIDEO. I'M SURE THESE WERE RUSHED FOR THE CHRISTMAS SEASON AND WILL BE PULLED AS FAST. TOO MANY FLAWS TO NOT GO BACK AND REDO OR RE-EXAMINE THE MASTER. THERE IS A REASON THE USED/NEW ONES BY INDEPENDENT SELLERS HAS PLUMMETED $20 IN 2 DAYS. BEWARE AND DON'T GET ONE OF THESE FROM THE BAD RUN IN MANUFACTURING!!!"
2,Trash,"I watched a few episodes of this show on the recommendation of a friend and I'm not sure what appeal this show holds. It's full of paparazzi jerks running around making life miserable for everybody around them. The characters are all really disagreeable - except perhaps the psychitzo photographer. Also, at least one scene per show borders on hardcore porn. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it does have some innovative cinematography. Still, the show overall feels like reading a tabloid mag in the supermarket aisle."
3,SAY CHEESE!!!!,"Courtney Cox is pretty convincing as Lucy Spiller the conniving managing editor of Dirt magazine. Frankly, it's a juicier role than that of Monica on Friends. But for all it's glitz, there's nothing really exciting about the series. Big stars, feeding big ego's and hiding big secrets trying to outwit the press at every step of the way. What's new about that? In the end, even though the writing is great, the premise is old. It's still all about stars and their crazy care free lives."
3,ICK,"The product came in great condition, and I have no issues at all with the sender. I used to love this show. I now realize when it was on, I was like 14. It's really not a good show...I took it to a local store and traded it for 15 bucks!"
2,"exciting parts, but lackluster overall","The storyline was fine, but the characters in this book were flat and mostly stereotypes. The ""good"" brother is too good, the ""bad"" brother is all bad, and the popular jock is a jerk.The female portrayals were the most disappointing of all. Mom is weak and helpless and must be taken care of by her men; the girlfriend takes the moral high ground--but we all know what she really wants/needs, right guys?I thought we had come further than this."
4,Growth!,"Gloria Estefan, my friends, is a grown up woman...And that shows in Unwrapped. I'm not talking about the sexual side of being grown up. Unwrapped is an intimate effort that hits new ground for Mrs. Estefan, who, this time, lets us into her life, with some rules about love, passion and family. The 1,2,3 and Conga days are almost completelly gone in this album (Except for Te amare). Insted you have an acoustic, string and andine-instrumentation inffected compilation with and organic feel. The first song you face,A Little Push, it's awesome. Wrapped,Time Waits and Into you (with Stevie Wonder) are the stand outs of these effort. I've got to say that, even though I've liked some of her songs in the past,I've never being a fan of her music. But with Unwrapped, my friends, we are in front of the ultimate Gloria Estefan masterpice!Well done!"
3,"Sounds like a Spanish album - huh, go figure.","I can't help but think that this album would have kicked serious butt if it was entirely in Spanish. The tracks that are in Spanish (extra) are brilliant. This is an album that needs to be listened to, with no distractions. This is an album that needs to be listened to in a dark room so you can float away with Gloria.Its a beautiful moody album, a million miles in the opposite direction from Livin' la vida Loca - baby!!Thanks Gloria, love you...xx"
2,"Gloria es mi idolo, pero...","Ella tiene limitaciones en su voz, y las baladas lentas no son para ella. Las canciones de Wrapped y Te Amare (ambas tambien grabadas en espanol) son las mejores canciones de este album. Es posible que los que compramos el album lo hicimos por inercia y respeto al trabajo de Gloria. Espero que el proximo album sea mas bailable que este. Gloria va a ser siempre una mejor interprete de la musica bailable (lease Celia Cruz.)"
2,Why Gloria why??!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"I have been a fan of Gloria Estefan ever since she debuted with the Miami Sound Machine in 1985. When I heard that she had a new album coming out after such a long hiatus, I was sooo excited! And then...I bought it....and was so disappointed!!! Gloria is trying so hard to be Celine Dion with a Spanish/Latin backdrop. Why?? Gloria has such a wonderful voice, and when she lays it against hot latin beats, there is hardly another that can match it. Granted, I like her slower love songs when I am in the mood, but she is at her best when she makes you move your feet! This album just didn't do that. It is too adult contemporary....and it could be her undoing in the end. In my opinion, there will never be another LET IT LOOSE or GLORIA, but one can never lose hope. Please, Ms. Estefan, take a moment and go back to those roots!!!"
4,"Welcome back, Gloria","Gloria has finally given those of us who are not fluent in Spanish something to chew on. This album is both subtle and daring in its combinations of latin rhythms and basic grooves. Tracks like ""Te Amare"" tame your need for an upbeat danceable tune while ""In the Meantime"" gives your soul something to reflect on. Right there in between the two is ""Wrapped,"" the first single off the album which is an excellent blend of both extremes. Great job Gloria - you definitely still have it after all these years!"
2,Lo siento pero es una porqueria....,Realmente el disco es malisimo. Todas las canciones se parecen y parecen viejas. El disco es sumamente aburrido y monotono. Hasta la foto de la caratula es vieja ya que Gloria no se ve tan joven como en esa foto. El disco es casi tan decepcionante como sus discos anteriores excepto Mi tierra que es excelente.
4,I am happy with this CD,"So far, I was only getting the Spanish albums by Gloria. I heard ""Hoy"" online and loved it. The four songs in Spanish made me get this CD. Honestly, I am really happy to have gotten it. It is great, mature and makes you want to listen to it more an more.In places, the lyrics are a little bit to crammed and sometimes to cheesy -- happiness doesn't pay I guess. The best art comes from despair. Look at Madonna!Anyway, besides this weak point, this album is wonderful and I urge everyone to get it. It's not a collectors item, it is worth more."
3,A Decent Collection; Fond Memories for Me,"The five volume set to which this CD belongs was my introduction to classical music, and thus gives me fond feelings. But on a more objective level, these selection CDs aren't much more distinguished than any other. The performances are all assured, the sound always digital, and the music charming. It never ventures into any music beyond the 1890s (and rarely even that). This volume was the one I listened to the least.It would probably be a better investment of your money to purchase one of the wonderful MP3 sampler albums out there. You can get 99 tracks for $5 if you buy right! Take advantage of the digital age if you can. Otherwise, don't buy these albums unless you see them in the clearance section of your local used book store."
2,Incomplete,"This book is filled with translations of business-related English phrases. While the quantity of terms and the quality of the translations are good, there are two fundamental flaws with this book.1. All the Japanese terms are written in Romaji, or alphabetic characters. While this may be adequate for those who are just learning the language, it is very limiting for advanced speakers, who are probably more likely to use the high-level expressions contained in this book. I realize that the first edition of this book was published in 1991, but would it have been too much to ask to include the Japanese? Even for a beginning user it can be quite helpful to have the Japanese text to show to a native speaker when communication breaks down. Sometimes Romaji can't cut it.2. It's only English-Japanese. If you want to go the other way, you're pretty much out of luck.This dictionary is [inexpensive], but in this case you get what you pay for."
4,Just what the doctor ordered!,"Bought this for my 2-year old nephew. The case is fairly durable and closes nicely. No pieces too small that would pose a choking hazard (unless your child chews on things). Overall, very satisfied with the product. Not too many pieces to lose and perfect size for a first doctor kit."
2,Fun toy but falls apart,"My daughter was thrilled to receive this gift. She immediately went upstairs to fix her sick stuffed animals and her brothers.However,within 10 minutes of playing with this doctors kit the case top fell apart. The stethoscope does not fit my petite daughters ears and the heart monitor did not work. The head mirror does not fit on her head or even around her one year old baby brothers head. The blood pressure monitor does not stay together.We will be returning."
4,Daughter loves it!,"My daughter loves this toy! She walks around wanting to check everyone's cough, ears, etc. My only complaint is that the stethoscope is rather flimsy and has a few kinks in the main line already."
3,Could be better,This is a cute doctor kit that both my kids enjoy. However the blood pressure gauge constantly comes apart which is frustrating for them. Also - I gave up on the case and threw it away - it was nearly impossible for me to fit all the pieces back in and close the thing - there's no way a child can do it. I ended up getting a generic plastic box which made everyone happier. I think one of our craft projects this summer is going to make our own doctors bag... I think there are better kits out there.
2,Ouch! Pinches toddler necks - leaves welts!!!!,"My daughter LOVES this kit. However...stethoscope can pinch necks VERY easily!!! My daughter got 3 welts on the first day before I could tell what was causing them. Very poor design in which hard plastic parts are designed to pull apart, create a gap, and then close - ON SKIN!!!I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUY THIS KIT FOR THIS REASON ALONE. There are many others out there that will not inflict pain."
5,Makes Doctor Visits less Scary,My little girl has to go to the doctor quite a bit. This little set makes her familiar with some of the things that will happen in the office and she even gives me and the family dog out check-ups!
1,Poor quality,"Good concept, but so poorly done I wish I had bought another one: the blood pressure cuff pieces will not stay together for more than a couple minutes. The pieces will not fit back in the box after the first time you take them out - no joke, you'll spend five minutes trying different ways to put them in before realizing if it takes that long for you, your kid certainly will not succeed. The lid of the box comes apart easily and won't stay put back together. The stethoscope doesn't really reach the ears.If this toy was durable and the box wasn't a throwaway, it would be a good one!"
5,The doctor is in,"My daughter loves playing doctor with this kit. The size of the items are perfect for little hands. She plays with her dolls and stuffed animals, giving them exams and pretending they are sick. She even took it to the doctor's office for her last visit and was more cooperative for the doctor knowing what he would do. All the pieces fit nicely in a small carrier for easy travel."
3,Safe but not great,"I purchased this doctor set for my 2 year old. It is the only one that I have found so far that is rated by the manufacturer for an age less than 3 years. It gives a good visual sense of thetools a doctor uses, but they are not very fun to play with. The stethphascope (spelling!) does not fit very well in my childs ears and around her chin, the tube that attaches to the part youplace on the chest is not very long. The blood pressure measurer keeps falling apart. There is a mirror that looks like something used in a dentists office. It takes carefull rearranging to get all the items back into the carrying case.I was hoping for a toy that could ease my childs fears about going to the doctor and spark imaginative play. This toy does okay, but not great job of meeting these needs."
1,Not worth the retail price!,"I was in shock when I recieved the Doctors Kit. I had purchased two sperate kits - this one for a younger child and the Fisher Price Kit for the older child. Not only was this Doctors Kit twice the price as the Fisher Price kit, the equipment was exactly the same except for a few noises the toys made. What a disappointment! It will be returned immediatly."
5,25 Month Old Loves It,"My 25 month old daughter loves this toy. If you are a parent who plays with their child, you will too. This is a poor choice of toy to just hand to a child; it requires interactive play, at least initially. The case is a bit fragile, though. A small purse/bag works just as well as a substitute doctor's bag."
4,2.5 Year old loves it but falling apart,Purchased in part b/c reviews suggested it was the sturdiest of the bunch. Neighbor has the alternative blue case and accessories.My 2.5YO daughter loves this but cramming all the pieces into the case has finally broken the latch beyond repair. The toys are reasonably sturdy but the stethoscope doesn't fit ears well-she just wears it around her neck. (The other child's doctor kit actually transmits some amplified sounds but no electronic sound effects of coughing and thump-thump). The blood pressure unit doesn't go or stay on very well and falls apart. (But after quite a few tries re-assembling it has become part of the game).Double the price but not double the quality of the blue one.
3,Only clear handle part opens,"The case does not open fully, just at the top where you pull the handles apart- large enough for little hands to reach in but not so much for adults. It's hard to fit everything back in easily (especially the stethoscope) and close the top. A 3 year old will have trouble. Otherwise size is good for little hands and colors are fun, but I want an easier case for in/out playing. It's going back."
5,Hours of Fun,"We got this for our daughter when she was 3 years old, and it was one of her favorite toys. The plastic kit is pretty durable, and the instruments are the perfect size for little hands."
1,My daughter cut her finger when closing the kit,The kit box is not designed to be closed easily. It cut my daughter's finger when she tried to close it :(
4,Above Average,1. Stethescope is a little bit small -maybe to avoid having it wrap around the kid's neck.2. Box cover breaks easily.3. Everything else is fine. Good construction. My son likes it very much.
5,BEST DOCTORS KIT FOR A TODDLER!!!,"My 19 month old son loves this doctors kit!! He use to play with my 4 year old niece's doctors kit. Her kit had small pieces so I decided to purchase this one for him. He especially loves the coughing and beating heart sounds on the stethoscope! Now, when my niece visits, she wants to play with his kit instead of hers!"
1,How did this toy win an award?,"It doesn't seem like it was tested with kids at all. The bag/box is too small for the toys. As a result the handles come off - and they are very difficult for an adult to put back on. The stethoscope is a weird shape. It is too short from the ears to the neck for even a toddler. The BP cuff comes apart, and again, cannot be put back together by a child. The ""shot""/""medicine"" was a hit, but otherwise this was a waste of money. I'm going to get the Fisher Price kit this year."
1,Broke within seconds!!,"I ordered this toy doctor's kit and a second one of a different brand for my 20 month old twins. In less than 5 minutes the tube on the stethoscope AND the blood pressure cuff broke on this toy, rendering both of them useless. The tubing on the same toys in the other kit have held up just fine. Thank goodness I bought the other kit, but what a waste of money this was!!"
2,Crappy,Poor quality. Would spend A little more getting better set. The stethoscope is flimsy and never worked and the blood pressure cuff falls apart. It is really hard to fit all the pieces in the dr bag. Do not recommend.
1,Little Dr. Kit,"This toy was really a dissapointment. The first time it was played with, the blood pressure tool kept falling apart.The stethescope won't stay in my daughters ears, they keep falling out, and the handle on the Dr. bag just felloff. My daughter just got the toy for Christmas, and has only had it for a few hours!.I would not recommend this toy."
2,Hoped for more,"After reading the reviews, I decided on the International Playthings Little Doctor Kit. I was disappointed, however, at how small it was (once the items are out of the kit, it's nearly impossible to get them all back in -- this thing is TINY). Moreover, the kit is hard plastic and the two ""doors"" that open at the top leave only a small space for putting things back in -- and my 3-year-old grandson had one of them broken off within a half-hour. I'd hoped for something more durable."
3,"Fun, but breaks in a heartbeat","My 4 year old loves his doctor kit, but after one day of use, several pieces are falling apart. The stethoscope and blood pressure monitor have come apart (the tube separated from one side), and the lid to the carrying case has come off several times. He's getting great fun out of it, anyway, but it'd be much more entertaining for everyone if I didn't have to reassemble it every 10 minutes."
4,lots of fun,"this is a great toy! my only complaint is that there is not quite enough room for all the things to fit in the case- other than that, it's perfect for my 2.5 year old!"
2,Not too thrilled,I bought this item for my 18 month old who is afraid of going to the doctor. I was not too happy with it when I got it. The carrying case is much too small for all the pieces. There is no way a child would be able to put back all the pieces. I have a very hard time fitting them all in. The tube falls out of the blood pressure cuff much too easily and the doors have also snapped off a few times. I will be returning this kit and looking for another one with a bigger carrying case.
2,returned for the classic Fisher Price...,"The box for these toys doesn't close well, the toys don't fit back inside the box and the closure on the top of the box broke after about two hours of normal play. We returned this and bought the classic Fisher Price version."
2,not worth the money,"Got the doctor set for my boy as he is really into Doc McStuffins right now. Didn't want to spend too much money, but this is not worth the few dollars that it did cost. It is really hard to fit all the stuff in the bag and be able to close it. The stethoscope is a weird fit and won't really stay on. The pump for the blood pressure gauge keeps on coming off, won't stay on. Everything else seems fine so far, but the few main pcs are a big turn off for my boy to keep on playing with the set."
1,Poor Quality,The lid on this toy does not close and the toys do not fit in the box. I would not recommend this toy.
2,Not Great,"We received this as a gift for my 2 year old's birthday as I really wanted her to have a medical kit to play with. As others have said, the stethoscope will not stay in her ears because the ear buds are so large. And it doesn't sit under the chin well. The heavy electronic end part to the stethoscope got pulled off the rubber tube on Day 1 as it was being pulled out of the case.It is difficult to get all the pieces back in such that you can close the cheap handles to the case. And the reflex hammer looks nothing like any reflex hammer I've ever seen. The blood pressure cuff is cute but difficult for my 2 year old to work since the bulb is large and takes a fair amount of strong pressure to squeeze.I agree that the dentist-like mirror seems out of place. The shot makes a squeaky noise so isn't very realistic. I do like the bandaid.Overall, I do not like this kit."
3,Broken Stethescope,"I bought it because of the stethescope that actually made sounds. I took the items out of the box, pushed the button on the stethescope and it worked...but just one time. After that, the stethescope didn't work anymore.Just to clarify, from the other reviews, the items fit back in the box if you put them in largest to smallest, but you have to put them in just right or the top won't close.My son did like the squeaky shot. If it weren't for the broken stethescope, I would've kept this kit. Luckily, Amazon fully refunded my money."
2,Cute but not well made,The stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff both are very easy to pull apart and I'm planning on buying a new one less than a month after I gave it to my daughter.
3,"Lots of Pieces in Dr. Kit, but not quality!","There are lots of interactive pieces in this doctor kit and they are cute. There's enough variety to keep a budding doctor busy practicing. The bag opens at the top and my nephew broke it straight away. If there's any pressure on the lid due to the stethoscope being too big for the bag it easily pops the plastic hinges, plus it's really too small for all the tools. The tube on the blood pressure cuff constantly falls off and the stethoscope is oddly shaped and short making it not fit well in the ears. The stethoscope does make the sounds of a heartbeat and coughing which my nephew thinks is just great when giving check-ups. This set has a lot of fun features, but its quality is sorely lacking for the price."
2,poorly made,"Like other reviewers have noted, the handles have both broken, the blood pressure cuff tube is broken and the stethoscope never stayed on a child's head to begin with. I would also add that the bag was too small to readily accommodate the stuff that was supposed to fit in it. There must be better doctor's kits somewhere."
5,Very Good Quality Metallurgy,I purchased this item to donate to a charity auction. It is actually one of the best quality beds I've ever purchased. The frame is a very heavy solid piece of metal. I ordered late and needed the item in a rush. This vender was very helpful and was understanding when I had to make changes I had not included in the original order.
2,"Good Solution, but Bottle Sucks!","I didn't know this was a simple human brand until I saw it on Amazon, I purchased this at Petsmart. Being a simple human brand, I would expect them to have a better bottle.Works fine as a cleaning solution, but the bottle sucks.1- The ""straw"" isn't long enough so you have a lot of left over solution when you near the end.2- Also because the straw isn't long enough, you can't actually spray downward onto the floor, where you actually Need to spray. You can only get a good spray when held horizontally and from a distance. so make sure you know how to aim, and calculate the curve correctly.3 - Also it leaks, a lot, if you accidentally tipped it over and its on its side.Since this item is for pet accidents, you would think they would design the bottle so you can actually spray the floor on the actual spot."
2,Stinky pee odor lingers,"We have an 8-month Terrier mix who left her pee mark on the carpet. I cleaned it twice with Resolve carpet cleaner,but the odor remains so I bought this Extreme Stain and Odor Remover. Applied it generously and scrubbed. It stillsmells the next day so I applied it a second time and let it sit for a full day. When I'm standing up, I cannot smell thepee odor anymore, but bending down close to it, I can still smell it. And if I can smell it, then it's a sure bet that our dogcan still smell her mark.I kept the product only because I cannot return it anymore. I cannot really recommend it."
1,Worst Simple Solution product I've ever purchased.,Not great. Way worse than the Simple Solution I've been using for the past 10-15 years. This product doesn't lift stains out whether you follow the package instructions or not. It simply doesn't work. So disappointed.
4,Great cleaner for puppies,This stuff is a life saver and really does the trick. I have an 8 week old Maltese puppy in my apartment Which is carpeted. It would be totally ruined if not for this cleaner. It picks up stains and completely removes any odor.
4,Works well.,"Product is effective and easy to use. Eliminates odors even if they are found a little late.Simple Solution Extreme Stain and Odor Remover, 32-Ounce Spray Bottle"
1,Don't waste your money,This product did not even begin to touch the dog poop stain on my carpet. Kids and Pets is a much superior product. If I could give simple Solution a 0 star rating I would.
3,"Just OK, not anything impressive.","It did help on a couple of ""accidents"" on our carpet, but it seemed like it tried to mask the smell more than get rid of it."
5,Works and smells good too!,"This stuff is great. The smell is wonderful and it thoroughly eliminates the odor. Be sure to follow directions for use, as you MUST saturate the area and allow it to completely dry."
3,It's not extreme,"I moved into a new apartment where the bedroom carpet had a number of pet stains that had not been removed before my tenancy. This product helped diminish those stains, but in no way fully removed them. I applied the spray twice, waited first 5 minutes, then 15 minutes, respectively, and then I used elbow grease and scrubbed. Maybe my stains were too tough, but I was a bit disappointed.As far as smell goes, I can't comment. I had already removed the pet odor with a pet odor removal powder sold by Glade."
1,Not Great For White Carpeting...,"I couldn't really comment on this product until I used it 3 times in one weekend. Over rated on Amazon. I used it over Thanksgiving weekend to clean up family dogs that all came over on Thanksgiving weekend and wanted to leave a little gift on my expensive white carpeting. One other dog also threw up from the excitement.It removed potty OK, but left blotches... I was unable to remove vomit even though we used the product within 30 seconds of the accident happening (according to the label directions) and used a paper towel to get everything up before using the product.Resolve Foam Heavy Traffic that we purchased at Kroger for $3.00 less removed the vomit and all of the stains and the blotches. Perhaps it is because I have white carpeting. Left a strong pleasant odor for about 1 day also."
2,"Rats, I can't smell anything but my cat still can :(",...Even after I left this cleaner soaking in the rug over the entire weekend and then washed it out with soap. I give up. I threw the rug out and the cat is next! ;P
1,Did't work for me,"I just left a lengthy review of the carpet shampoo bottle of 64 oz. I tried this on a 100% wool estate sale rug that I bought. Must have been used in the dining room as there were a few un washed food stains but lots of dog/cat urine stains that clearly had never been treated for stain removal. After treating the numerous spots 4 times without any appreciable results, I used my Bissell Pro Heat carpet machine with the Extreme carpet shampoo and still nothing...The rug is going to the dump and I am demanding a refund since the product is guaranteed to work.I does not ! I wish I could post pictures to show you before and after shots.....No difference !"
1,Did not work for us,Our dog has been having some upper GI issues causing him to vomit pretty much on a daily basis. I decided to try this product based on all of the great reviews. It did not work for us (bile/ yellow vomit on a beige carpet).
5,WONDERFUL STUFF,"this is doing a wonderful job ...at both ridding my home of dog pee odor...AND ...stopping the dogs from ""repeat performances"". wish i would have found this sooner!!!!!!!!!"
5,POW! now that's what i call a story!,"This book is the type that I find few and far between. Without so much as blinking i was already through the first hundred pages. Since i have a very short attention span, you can see why this is a big deal. This book made me not want to sleep, eat, or do anything to deter me from its pages. When it was over I was left sated but wishing there were a thousand more pages to come. Luce Lemay's auspicious heart, dealt a hard luck hand, kept me filled with hope, wonder and awe. Even after a month since I finished it, I still can't help but wonder what old Luce is doing now."
4,Interesting and informative,"A good way to describe this book is a cross between a textbook, a trade journal, and a catalog. Being definately a large volume, it attempts to cover a lot of information in bite sized chapters. I would think the best use for this book is as a reference. You can build some of the projects listed in it as stand alone applications, but they work best when combining them with your own ideas, or supplementing info from other book projects.All in all, this book is a good addition to a robot reference library."
2,400 pgs before the first project,"this is a big investment of time dedicated to reading 400 pages before ANY physical pay-off. there's also no jumping straight to the projects because after they describe how to build a chassis for the first project, the rest of the directions are ""powering the robot: chapter 17, selecting a motor for your robot chapter 19, operating your robot with a computer chapter 12"" so even the projects aren't really dialed in specifically. the back of the book says ""for beginners"" I have to disagree, beginners should start off w actual kits first, and after a few different kits come to this tome so they can learn how to build one from the motherboard up. I regret buying this book, i should have bought a kit or an arduino, something that would have satisfied while I was learning. I'm giving it two stars because, as I'm sure it's a great book for people already acquainted w/robotics, it's no place to start for an absolute beginner."
3,Basic Text for Robot Builders,"A good text for beginners in the construction and design of robots, both for school and for the fans, has a great list of pages with information, news and sale items."
3,Not terrible but not great,"This book is good at explaining things at the individual chapter level, but completely out of order for a common sense understanding of secured transactions. I found it helpful to supplement this book with a Gilbert's commercial outline to understand the proper progression of a secured transaction. That being said, the authors do a decently good job at explaining things and I hated it less than other text books."
3,Ok,"Arrived with small scratch. Gift for husband and he liked it. However, should have arrived unscratched to earn great review."
4,Would have 5 stars if...,"It were made in the USA like the old BUCKs my dad has.That being said, the knife is freaking sleek. I love the stainless finish. The blade came SHARP! This is almost an issue because I bought this for my girlfriend. She started carrying an old pocket knife of mine, but that one was too bulky and dull. This trusty little bugger weighs in at 1.3 oz, which is pretty sweet. Unfortunately, you cannot put the clip on the other side for southpaws. But that is only an issue for <10% of the population.In conclusion, I want to order another one for myself. I'm a little envious of what my girlfriend's packing in her pocket! ;)"
3,Easily nicked,"I've had two of this model because I enjoy the thinness and the frame-lock, but the blade has been a bit disappointing. Both of the ones I've owned nicked very easily, and don't hold their edge especially well, considering that I only use my knife occasionally and sharpen it almost weekly. Since I'm willing to put the effort into maintaining it, it works for me, but if you're looking for a low-maintenance blade, stick with a Hunter or a Ranger."
5,Buck 327,Great edge out-of-the-box and after abuse. Broad enough for eating. Finish holds up wether playing engineer or trimming a shooting lane. Less than 3 inch blade passes concealed carry law.
3,Buck Nobleman,"The used Buck Nobleman I purchased was in ""pristine"" condition. It was a replacement for a slightly different older model US-made Buck that I lost in Northern Wisconsin while grouse hunting. They no longer carry the model I lost.Having been made in China, the new knife showed some obvious Chinese-made influence, the most noticeable being that the ""one-hand operation"" is not nearly as easy to open and close with one hand. I think with some strategic filing/polishing I can get it to work as flawlessly as my old Buck.Aside from that, it's all good, razor-sharp etc. All things considered, not the least of which is the price of a brand new knife, I'm pleased with my purchase."
2,Not carbon fiber!,"First this knife is not made with any carbon fiber! It is made to look like carbon fiber, the knife came with very poor q/c. 1. The blade was off center, the Pivot screw was too tight, I had to remove it, put blue lock tight and put it back to a proper tightness. The edges of the thumb studs were very sharp and actually cut me.It is too bad, because if it was properly advertised and made just a little better this knife would be a good inexpensive knife for an edc size, it does have a decent blade that was sharp out of the box.Update: They have now pulled off the carbon fiber title-Thank you! But do a carbon fiber knife search and this still comes up."
4,Very nice knife for Boy Scout use,Bought this after my son lost his other knife. This one looks good and seems to hold it's edge very well. Priced right and shipped fast!!
2,Only one good feature,"These are not the old Buck Knife Co quality blades of the past. Opening and closing is needlessly cumbersome. Possible to cut finger if not careful. Good thing is that they are very thin and fit in any pocket without notice, and the silver finish makes them easy to see if dropped in the woods."
1,What a mess!,"I got this from my local mystery bookstore. It came highly recommended, but I was very disappointed with it. I did not get what was going on at all. Being a scholar myself, I was horrified by the scene where the main character takes an axe to boxes of research materials from some of the greatest literary lights of English Literature: Virginia Woolf, Henry James, T.S. Eliot. Does this writer have a grudge against literature professors? And what does the title mean? Who was Mrs. God?"
1,Started out as exciting but became terribly convoluted,"I was looking forward to this tape but after the first half hour it sank into a morass of death metaphors and insecurities. Although I adore the work of Kevin Spacey, not even his considerable efforts could save this choppy audiotape."
2,Mrs. God,I just received this book in the mail today and even though I have not read it yet I probably would not have spent $20 on a book that just has 185 pages! It is tiny! All I can say is it better be darn good!
4,Simple Fun,"It is simple, but it is fun. The toy works as you would expect. You won't be amused for a long time.I would suggest just setting it on a coffee table or an end table for a distraction or conversation piece.I wouldn't let anyone under 9yrs to play with it alone. It isn't really durable enough to withstand kid play."
1,reviwer1,"toy was broken when it arrived, should have sent it back but got it right before christmas and had to give it to my nephew broken, didnt have another gift. Box was completely smooshed, couldnt believe a toy that fragle would be shipped without paper stuffing or some sort of protection."
4,Good for the price,This is a lightweight compass that reminds me of the one I use to use in the Scouts. Simple to use and very responsive.
4,Good practical compass,"This is a good practical compass, good for use on a map and about perfect for hiking. It's a good value. jt/VT"
3,backwards,"I could be confused, but when I was in the States, the compass' red pointer went into the red ""shed"" (red guides), and that was North.However, I am now in India, and somewhere along the way, the black pointer going into the red ""shed"" is now North.I am still in the Northern Hemisphere, and my declination adjustment is virtually zero.What is going on here??"
3,Hikers compass,"What too say, it's a compass. The reason I only gave it three stars is - I wish it had a better locking device, so when I set the thing too where I want to go, it stays put ! I set this compass on a few hikes and placed it in a loose fitting pocket and each time the dial moved off of the setting I had it on ! Just wish they would make a better lock system for these things is all. Quality is good other wise.Probably would not recommend just because it does not lock securly !"
3,Works as Advertised,"The hooks matched the bar and were properly angled at 90 degrees so that more pots can be hung on edge. At $4.33 APIECE they are not only matching and magnificent, they are the only game in town! $26 for bent wire???? Come on!!"
3,Loved that Popeye Song...,"....but a little Eddie goes a long way. If you're even reading Eddie Bo reviews, the odds are that you want to own this because you're a NO R+B fanatic.If you're looking to just go further afield from Professor Longhair, I prefer Chris Kenner's rawer sound."
1,Chinese Cheepo,"I returned this product the very same day I received it. I do most of my knife buying off Ebay, and took a foolish chance on this product. Buck lost it's reputation when it shipped offshore"
1,Not a Buck knife,This is not a Buck knife .It is a cheap China imitation. The blades very skimpy and small. Buck should be ashamed of it self .What happened to MADE IN AMERICA
1,Find Something Better,"Since when are Buck knives made in China? Anyway, its bad steel, makes it hard to put an edge on it and it doesn't hold that edge long. Had a Schrade Old Timer before (it got lost) and I pretty much wasted my money on this as a replacement."
1,Good Other Cuz,"I have 2 labs that are fairly aggressive chewers, but bought this toy for them to play with under supervision. I enjoyed watching them chase each other around the room for about 5 minutes squeaking it and having a wonderful time until the squeaker fell into the inside. I was hoping that the toy would last longer than 5 minutes! I am just thankful it fell into the inside and not outside where the dogs could swallow it."
1,Beware!,"This toy lasted for one short play session before my Alaskan malamute chewed out the squeaker. Fortunately, I was watching carefully and took the toy away from him. The Little River Pet Shop has not replied to the complaint I sent three weeks ago. Don't waste your money on this toy!"
4,nice boots but not Corcoran brand,"I've wanted a pair of tanker boots for years and finally decided to splurge. The price was right and the Corcoran name is legendary. Unfortunately I was disappointed to find another name on the tag when I got my pair. They are still very nice boots and they are made in USA (which is getting hard to find). I agree with the earlier reviewers comments about the short straps. I'm no fattie and I can barely get the arch straps buckled, another 1/2"" to 1"" of strap would help. Other than that they are comfortable right out of the box, water resistant and easily take a high shine.Maybe Corcoran sells their boots under another name too. I'm no brand whore but I like quality stuff and I like to know exactly what I'm getting."
4,OK quality,"These boots were as I expected, with only two flaws thus far. Both deal with the straps on the right boot. The top strap, even when fully tightened, still results in a loose fit. Punching a hole further up the strap cured that. The lower strap has what I believe to be a manufacturing defect. When buckling that strap the leather just stretches out and doesn't really provide a superb fit.Despite the flaws I am still happy with my purchase."
2,Very unhappy.,"This is not the Tankerboot I remember at all. The actual fitting of the boot was incorrect. What I mean to say is, the physical size of the boot was not the size advertized. The straps were substandard, and would in my opinion would have worn out in short order. The reason I can say this is that I myself am a leather worker. I would have to remove and upgrade the straps to have any confidence in them. In closeing a size six fit like a size five. If you order these order large. Myself I went back to Corchran Jumpers. My last two of those sets lasted so long they couldn't be resoled any longer. Five times to be exact. And I went directlly to U.S. Calvary [...], much better service."
1,Boots,Wrong size sent to me. Product was not what was expected. The quality was not good and the leather was like paper. Definately not worth the money. Tried to return them and initially had trouble. No one responded. I was told they missed/did not get the email. I finally received the return label and sent them back. I was credited immediately.Dont know if I would buy with the company again but I would never buy shoes from that manufacturer with seeing them first.
1,Stopped working after one month,"After one month of use, the appliances plugged into this timer did not work anymore. I can get the red LED to turn on and off when it's plugged into the wall, but there is no voltage coming out. (I measured it with a voltmeter.) Target doesn't seem to be selling it anymore, so I'm just going to get a refund."
2,Relay failed,"The flexible programming of this unit initially worked well timing my 13-amp espresso machine. But after about 3 months the internal relay became intermittent, so the timer would come on, but power to the expresso machine would drop out after a short time. Tapping the timer would turn it back on, suggesting the relay as the culprit. Now I'm looking for something more reliable."
4,Phone # and Address of the Company,"Mine came with an instruction manual. If you didn't get an instruction manual with this device, here is the address and phone number of the company (it was the address given if you wanted to return the product under warrenty).Salton, Inc.Time Division Service Center17160 Plant RoadLaurinburg, NC 28352(800)919-3101Ask for the 12/871 Electric Digital Timer Instruction Manual.Hope this helps."
1,Unacceptable failure rate,I bought 4 of the immediate predecessors of this model in March 2004; thus far 2 of them have failed-- dead. Salton's response was that they were out of warranty . . . period. I am curious if people out there have had similar problems with Salton products
1,The worst timer ever!!!!!!!!,"This timer is so unreliable I am suprised that they are still on the market. No replaceable batteries so once the product's internal battery dies out, it is useless. I bought two of these timers and had to return both for a refund. The display screen went totally blank and failed to operate correctly after only a few of days. This is the first and last Timex product I ever buy. I failed to read the dreadful reviews before I purchased these timers but, hopefully, you will not."
2,Bad instructions,"The instructions are poorly written, and the user interface is confusing. I replaced this with a manual timer and am much happier with it."
2,timex timer,This product would work much better if I could figure out how to set the programs. It came without a manual and I am unable to find a manual on the web. The multiple program modes make programming difficult to decipher without the manual so it has been nearly worthless to me.
3,Great...then not so great.,I loved this timer at first. It worked very well for a year or so to turn the light on/off for my aquarium. Suddenly it stopped working.
2,"Looks great, but does it do anything?","Another product with no instructions or manual, I guess we are just supposed to plug it in and hope for the best! This product is not very intuitive, very difficult to determine if the programming is correct."
5,Unique Item,Great product for many applications. I use it to shut off my surround sound system after I have fallen alsleep listening to calming music. I am sure there must be a million ways to use this product...
4,Nice little unit,"I bought one of these and it's been working just fine for a few months now. I wanted something that would handle fluorescent lighting above my bird cage and it does the trick. You have to read the instructions to program it, and keep them around in case you need them again, but it becomes semi-intuitive after the first time or two. Nice product for the money."
4,Great timer,"I've had it for just under a month now. It does what it is supposed to do with no issues. It is easy to set and manage. I like that you can do multiples in one day or set of days down to the minute. It is quite flexible, even more than I need. The price was fair considering I couldn't find anything like this in any of the local stores. The ones I did were more or didn't do what I needed. Happy so far."
2,Counterfeit Tackle,"If you're into football and hard hitting you'll love the book Counterfeit Tackle. It's about a boy, Mike Robbins, who is going to a N.F.L game, but decides to let his brother go instead. There's only one problem, Mike's brother has a football game and he's afraid if he misses a game he will be kicked off the team. Mike finds out that without his glasses no one can tell the diference between the two. So they decide to let Mike play in his brothers place. His brother teaches him to play his positions and how to tackle. If you want to know what happens at the game you'll have to read the book and find out what I did and you'll enjoy the book."
5,The one transformer army!,If you think target masters are armed this one is a target master with two weapons too. Ricochet is one awsome transformer.
2,"Good recipes but really a ""potluck club""","This book is good for theme parties -- there are some really great recipes included, particularly the endive benedictine. However, there aren't enough recipes for each theme to give you the opportunity to pick and choose. I found that there were too many photos of the women compared to the food, and I also found that their concept of a ""cooking club"" to be more akin to a potluck dinner. If you are thinking of starting a cooking club, definitely cook together -- it is oh-so-much more fun!"

2,fulfills its purpose but not for newcomers,"With its wide selection of Rudolf Steiner's instructions, verses, soul exercises and meditative material for different levels of inner work, Start Now fulfills its purpose of conveying to the reading public that Steiner, known chiefly for the practical initiatives that arose from his insights, was ""first and foremost a spiritual practitioner and teacher."" Anthroposophists may appreciate finding so much good material, along with the fine Introduction by Christopher Bamford, between the covers of one relatively inexpensive book. Newcomers to Steiner and Anthroposophy, however, would do better to go directly to Steiner's basic books. Start Now is full of lamentable inconsistencies and ambiguities in its references and citations, with too little context for most selections and too many unexplained terms and concepts."
4,No Place to Begin But Here,"Sartre for Beginners by Donald Palmer (whom wrote a few of the 'For Beginners' books) gives a fun look at the popularizer of existentialism. Drawing from Sartre's life experiences, biography and influences to show how Sartre came to his theories. An easy read, although one must still contemplate on some level the philosophies that are presented before them. A good beginning book for anyone who wants to learn more about Sarte and existentialism in general. A good addition to the For Beginners book series."
4,Entertaining introduction to Sartre,"This book is not only informative but also humorous. There are many things that Sartre brings attention to that I have experienced in my own life but never noticed very much. For instance, Sartre's concepts of ""being-for-itself"" and ""being-in-itself."" If you are interested in an introduction to Sartre and the philosophy of existentialism, this is a good book to begin with. The reason I don't give the book five stars is because some of the points were explained badly, and the book got a little dry towards the end."
2,Really Bad,"I'm surprised people actually enjoyed this...I love the ""For Beginners"" series but this is by far the worst one I have read. The difference between this and, for example, Kierkegaard for Beginners is amazing. It's basically just a lack of real content. I'd still say it's alright as an introduction considering it's not wrong or anything, but honestly I expected much more from a book in this series."
2,Sad editing process in Kindle edition,I agree with Ken and want to add that the typographical errors in the Amazon Kindle edition made it almost unreadable. Please have some technician correct this!It did provide me with valuable information and connections about the Colorado/Denver people and an early perspective on that history.
2,views of the past,"If you can get past the racism and the favoritism of denver's high society of who's who of the ""goo goos""(term used buy some for the self-rightous in turn of the 19th century Denver) which leaves out important information in some events and in others raises questions of the validity of her accounts. With all that being said this was an entertaining read with much detail and in some areas very accurate. It also gives the reader some insight into the mind of the bias turn of the century author.(I haven't reaserched it but it would be no surprise if she was part of the sacred 36) It gives a feel of why for some it was a difficult time and for others a life of leisure. Whenever such writings of history are filled with such hatred and bias we must always question its genuineness. It's through this way we discovery the real truth of any history. That was my soap box moment...enjoy the read!"
4,No Box and the game says age 3+ not 6+,"Ship quick and pack well. However the game came without a box. Maybe just the picture was misleading. And it says for age 3+ not 6+ as expected. Almost have to return because this is part of my company's Angel Project, which is very age specific."
1,Buyer Beware - RCA not helpful if you have trouble with this tv,"My daughter won this television in a raffle. We brought it home and it was bob - bad out of the box. I sent an email to their customer service and received an email reply to call thier customer service number. I called the customer service number. The cust. serv. rep. said that because we didn't have a purchase receipt RCA would do nothing...even though we have photo documented proof of the box being factory sealed prior to our opening it (along with my daughter opening the first thing she has ever won) AND dated raffle tickets. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was disconnected. Maybe not intentionally, but with the tone of the conversation it sure felt like it. Bad form RCA!"
1,Not much help,"I bought this book as a jumior in High School and now that I am a college freshman I think that I can honestly say that the book did not help at all. Much better info was to be had at College Board's website and in the Barron's series. The book is boring and unhelpful concerning types of tests, dates of tests, and strategies taking the tests. It seems like a rush job, and a waste of money. Better you save 20 bucks and buy 10 real SAT's and simply take the practice exams. In this book the advice is so general and so banal that you will sleep your way--something thre authors seemed to do--after the first five pages. Go somewhere else and and pwork your way through the problems. The self help section at stores is so filled with this type of garbage that I expoect to see a book soon called Self Help Writers in Need of Self Help."
1,Worthless and Wriiten Worse,"I found the book's smug calmness irritating. Where examples should abound quasi-mystical nonsense is offered. Not at all balanced towards SAT Subject tests or the ACT the book has tiny chapters with tiny advice: Larry King's prose sings compared to the snivelling academic prose of blandness.A ""self-help"" book co-written by husband and wife. I'll leave the jokes about saleeping where you worked to you guys, but the fact that TWO people were required to writes makes me thing that an army of college graduates wrote Hemingway. Do we need to buy a book that tells us to sleep well before your exam and that--hint, hint--the test is a test of reasoning. Wow! And I thougfht the Kennedy conspiracy theory was ordinary."
1,One Stop Shopping For Perplexed Parents,"A silly and skimpy book by 2 ""experts""--just like I am an ""expert"" at sitting on a couch or driving around lost in New Jersey--that does not get into anything in depth or with elan or with brevity. The long winded generalizations make this book apparently palatable to everyone, but in essense, thanks top its lukewarm advice, banal hints, and skimpy overview of test and its history, make the book come off as no help to anyone at anytime. A chapter on minorities taking the sest and racial bias, a chapterr on genderr issues, a chapter on reading strategies for the individual passages of Critical Reading, would make this book at least worthwhile opening, if not actually buying. Study vocab, take some sample tests, and buy a book on Geometry. And then, savor the opportunity to test your logic and relax. You are just a kid once."
1,"Been There, Read It","A bunch of nonsense from ""experts"" who claim to be in the ""business"" for years, which probably means they went to ETS.ORG and read about SAT's and SAT II's and then went to a few colleges' websites to learn about admission dates and guidelines. The book is a real snoozer, empty of vividness, insight, or help. If my parent read this and then tried to relay this drivel to me I would sue for Child Abuse. Pay attention in class, go to a few websites, consult the trained help who have expertise at your school, study vocab, and leave this where it belongs: in the No Sale area in your Shopping Cart."
4,High Street,My dad read the 1st of this series in a reader's digest and then ordered the rest of the books from amazon. He is enjoying these books and recommends them to anyone.
3,Fun but spoons fall apart,"We had several fun games before the pins holding the spoons together began to fall apart. The pins are tiny and once they fall out of the groove, it is hard to get it back together again. Sometimes the pin is lost altogether. I would like to try the other Fundex toys that don't use this type of spoon slapping gadget."
4,Cooking Cookies Game,"My 5 year old little boy really enjoyed playing this game. He really liked how you have to smack the cards with the spoon to pick them up. The rotten egg cards came up quite often, so I would suggest for a quick game take 1 or 2 out of the deck."
2,cheaply made - make sure your tetanus shot is up to date,"I have a similar toy I bought in Germany decades ago. As I didn't want my child playing with it, I was glad to find this similar item. It is REALLY cheaply made. It does not run smoothly and it is not connected well. There are many sharp edges at the seams and tips. Sad really. How hard would it be to put the thing together properly?"
2,Funny but does not work well,"It took quite a while to get this to work (several weeks actually, had to take it apart) but once it did it gave everyone a good laugh. Not made well."
4,Holding history in my arms!,"When I received LIFE magazine and I opened the envelope which wrapped it, a miracle happened: I could see time turning back to the 60's. I knew I was holding history in my arms.Going through the pages of the magazine, was an experience full of excitement, curiousity for the way life was some decates ago. The reason why I wanted to get this issue, was, of course its cover and the historic person MELINA MERCOURI who enriched this beauty.It was like she was living again!I highly recommend the experience of getting LIFE historic issues, like this one. You will feel blessed!"
4,Defeat is not an orphan.,"One of the very few books on Mussolini that shows the true causes of Italy's failure in her war aims during World War II. MacGregor Knox does not fall into the trap that so many other historians show when retelling the total and abject failure of Italy's land, sea and air forces during the last world war. This is not simply a retelling of a dictator leading his country to ruin.The poor leadership of Italy's military leaders are shown in full light (Marshal Badoglio's vascillations, General Graziani's timidity and Admiral Cagnari's fabian tatics). The book also shows Mussolini's problems with the monarchy, the church, and the unwillingless of the Italian people themselves to be drawn into another world war.A must read for anyone who wants to read an unblemished account of Italy's performance in the last world war."
5,Excellent Docu,"This was an excellent view into the world of MMA. More than any other film it gives a true insight that these men are true athletes who are disciplined, smart, and kind. Just as a linebacker tries to put a quarterback out of the game these men try to put out their opponents. This film finally humanizes this sport and my wife even watched it and like it."
2,"Interesting guy, boring DVD","I've watched a lot of different 'real' fighting events, and Mark Kerr is one of the better performers. These guys work just as hard as pro-wrestlers, and take a lot more blows because most of these things are unscripted. And at the end of the day they don't make much money for their trouble. However the fact is this DVD will have you yawning in about 10 minutes. I can't really reccomend it."
4,potent,"The Smashing Machine - The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark KerrWell first of all me and all my friends are fans and collectors of anything to do with MMA. That being said, I know at least four people who bought the dvd of POTENT and none of them had any problems with the playback of the dvd. The audio and visual were perfect. I think it was the most intense and informative documentary about MMA I have seen. (I liked 'smashing machine' but it's a documentary more about a drug abuse.) This documentary was only and purely about MMA. Potent was what I have been waiting for , for a long time. I talk so highly of this documentary since I actually used some of the strategies in potent to help me win my last amateur MMA fight. So besides the great advice from all the fighters, the photograghy was awesome! great movie! (btw my friend who just watched my copy of potent says he agrees with me and loved the footage :) )POTENT - A Mixed Martial Arts Documentary"
5,A Matter of Faith,"I must say this is an excellent book that goes through life and friendship and just everything. What was cool about this is for half of the book the setting is at the North Carolina School of Science and Math, and that is where I am at right now. It was interesting his aspect of it, I look forward to Brian Morin's next book because I'm sure it will be as good as this one."
2,I don't know,"Don't get me wrong, the Lawrence Arms are one of my favorite bands of all time. I originally got into them because I was really into the Broadways when they were still together and was interested in what Brendan was doing after they broke up. Their first album ""A guided tour of Chicago"" is one of the best punk rock albums ever, but it seemed to me that their later albums get a little less better. I saw them over the summer one night at home and they were incredible and then a few weeks later this album came out and it just didn't do it for me. There wasn't anything that stood out in my mind about the album. Some songs are really short and others are just really slow. It's a lackluster effort in my opinion, it just wasn't up to my Lawrence Arms standards. Check out all their old albums, Broken Star by the Broadways, or Single File and Rise and Run by The Honor System (some of these guys were also in the Broadways) to get your money's worth."
3,I started laughing,"when the intro kicked in. Acoustic guitars? It reminded me of my roommate and my noodlings in our dormroom. But then the listener gets to the electric songs in which every song shares virtually the same tempo, the same four beats per measure, the same wall of distortion thanks to powerchords. Can we start to push the boundaries a little more, guys?Some people like this. I'll have to pass, however."
4,Goo Goo dolls revisted,The obvious musical reference is the Goo Goo Dolls pre-wimpy love-song-sell-out era. If you like the how the vocalists switch then check out the GG Dolls first release. Anything after that is Bon Jovi in the making...
5,Vintage Early 90's KRS...,"This is a rewind album with a collection of remixes and rare/unreleased tracks.If you like BDP, or more importantly, the early days of unrefined rap before it was tainted by 'hip hop', this is a must have. Most of the material is vintage early/mid 90's with KRS's fusion of hard beats, sampling mastery and reggae/dancehall influences shining bright.There are a few standout tracks. 'When the Moon' has the female contrast that goes so well with his hardcore style and beats. 'Free Mumia' has the political overtone and he (alongside Channel Live) drops knowledge. 'A Freestyle Song'...what would a KRS album be without a freestyle? (bonus- this one includes a young Common aka Common Sense) But the best track is 'Article (Remix)', a dancehall reggae medley that (if you're a yardie-wannabe like myself) will set the vibe straight!I&I"
4,Solid Release,"This is a solid release of good street poetry peppered with flashes of brilliance by a very good lyricist. Although the liner notes say that some of these songs are re-mixes, I only found 4 out of 20 easily recognizable.I think this album is well worth the money."
2,Chinky,"At times it is good, at times I'm ready for him to either out with Puff Daddy again, and or Lionel Richie.KRS has been getting pretty since Return Of The Boom Bap. Of course he still manages to impress here and there, but as for this album......more crap than good.I still prefer the KRS self titled CD over all."
4,Good but could be better,"It is a nice compilation. The art is good B&W; art. The book contains new armor, weapons, abilities, qualities and materials. I think this book has something for everyone.The alternate Magic Item creation is very nice and low magic games will love this for their game worlds.The index is nice to help you find stuff. It is well organized so that is a big help.All the random tables are in the appendix in the back."
4,A fine GG performance,"all you could ever ask for in a GG live vid - shakey camera work, caca, blood, fistfights, and the tunes...THE TUNES! This era of GG (the late '80s) saw the great doodoo rocker backed by a Black Sabbath-like band (they even jam on 'Sweet Leaf' at the end). Also included as a bonus is a show from '93, shortly before GG's passing, among other bits. But perhaps the most shocking part of the whole DVD is the backstage footage - GG comes off as a gentleman - chatting w/ fans and sipping a drink! If you haven't seen 'Hated' yet, make sure you see it first, as 'Live & Pissed' is a fine follow up. BITE IT YOU SCUM--FOREVER!!!!!!!!"
5,Fun,"A pretty old concert of GG Allin. A pretty good whow. Does alot of good songs. Mingles with the crowd, busts a few faces, (...) same ole same ole.A definite necessity for any GG Allin or PUNK ROCK fan."
2,not as promised!,"Buyer beware!This Dvd's running time is only 35 Minutes,not 50 Minutes as it is written above on the amazon review!The Movies are old and shows always the same landscape."
4,Interesting linkages,"This book is a bit uneven. Some of the chapters don't seem to fit too well (such as the Zak chapter). However, the book's argument--that evolutionary theory suggests different policy solutions to problems than standard social science theory--is nicely illustrated by other chapters. Chapters by Ellis and McGuire/Gruter and Blank all get one thinking that a knowledge of human nature might be very helpful in figuring out how we might address public problems.Thus, while it is regrettable that some chapters wander away from the book's theme, those chapters that address the central issues of the book (as outlined in the introductory essay) serve a valuable purpose."
2,A terrible idea,"My philosophy is simple: If it isn't broken, don't fix it.Attempting to modernise such Blondie hits like ""Heart of Glass"" is not a good idea. They are great songs, but when given the rave club treatment, they come across as mediocre dance songs one would expect from Ace of Base. In some of the songs, all that is added is one consistant beat, nothing more. Other times, they are overlong and lousy remixes (like the bonus tracks of the ""Atomic"" CD that you never listen to).I am not a big fan of remixes, sometimes they work, but when they don't work, it can totally butcher a good song. Some of the remixes are good, but not enough for me to recomend this to any Blondie fan."
2,one good track,"Other than the genuinely great remix of Atomic by Diddy, the remixes here are highly forgetable. Most remixes completely miss the point of the orginal tracks and sound like they were slapped together very quickly for a quick buck. Avoid."
4,Miss Harry - Remixed,"Blondie may be known for their catchy dance pop tunes, but their material is weightier than you'd think. Nonetheless, this remix album is a highly successful collection of reinterpretations of the band's hits. Tracks of note are MK's housed-up ""Heart of Glass,"" the energetic, trance-like ""Atomic"" by Diddy, and the disco-injected ""Dreaming."" Armand Van Helden's version of ""Atomic"" is effective as well, as does ""One Way or Another."" The disc's sole disaster happens to be the band's biggest hit: ""Call Me."" It's a missed opportunity that doesn't work. I also wasn't feelin' K-Klass's ""Rapture,"" either. Still this is an above-average remix project that should please dance lovers and Blondie fans alike."
4,ok remixes of their songs,"Nice to hear different versions of their songs to dance and sing to...always kinda dance, techno group so the remixes make sense"
3,Blondie - Remixed Remade Remodeled,"New wave innovator Blondie gets revamped for more modern club floors. There aren't any real surprises here; the mixes seem appropriately careful with the vocals, usually emphasizing the backbeat and updating the melodies with HI-NRG electronic florishes. Phillip Damien adds in a little Eurhythmics on his catchy mix of ""One Way or Another,"" and Pete Arden and Vinny Vero throw in some Latin-Caribbean flavor to ""The Tide is High."" For those miss the good ol' days of raves, the Utah Saints version of ""Dreaming"" will bring back all those good hardcore memories, but Armand Van Helden's hard house ""Atomic"" is disappointingly one-note. The mixes aren't particularly innovative -- they certainly are good for what they set out to do -- until you get to the Black Dog's version of ""Fade Away and Radiate."" Angular and mysterious, their mix once again shows how ahead of their time The Black Dog were."
1,"Save your money, buy ""No Exit"" instead!","Unlistenable. The original songs were great and the remixes just mess them up without adding any creativity. Maybe OK as background at a particularly zonked-out dance club. I mean it -- if you don't have Blondie's new ""No Exit"", buy it immediately, every single song on that 5-star album is worth more than this entire disc."
2,Oldtimer,"I recently purchased this item and figure that this remix compilation is no longer in style. 2004 I still like Blondie, but I was disappointed during checkin' out this cd. I can mark only 2 songs that decent: trk 4. Atomic (Diddy's 12"" mix) (back to many years I had that remix) and the only one song that kicks ass, is the last one: Fade Away And Radiate (108 BPM mix).This cd can be recommended only for Blondie fanatics. I'd rather buy the ""best of"" with the original versions."
1,No table of contents,Yet another ebook with either no table of contents or one that doesn't work. This is getting very old very quickly.
2,A light read; some funny parts.,"The stories--when first written--must have been funnier. For me, the cultural gap is too wide from the twenty-first century to more than a hundred years ago when poultry humor was funny because everyone raised chickens. Also, making fun of the upper class is humorous, but many of the jokes were repeated, for instance, about not having a good cook or good servants. There are a few funny kids that get the better of gullible adults, but, if I had known that I would be reading through so many other not-so-funny stories, I would have moved on to more promising reading.Overall, the stories had good set-ups, but nearly all of them stumbled on rather flat punch-lines."
1,Too Small To Hold Yoga Mat,"The bag was not big enough to hold my new 1/4"" thick standard size yoga mat. I then tried to put my old 1/8"" thick yoga mat into the bag and I had to really tug at the bag and bend my mat to get it into the bag. It is a very nice looking bag, but not practical at all."
1,"Sturdy, Great-Looking Bag...","But too bad my yoga mat doesn't fit inside. The description fails to describe that this bag WILL NOT FIT 1/4"" YOGA MATS. What a shame because it is a great-looking bag. I recommend getting a duffel bag for all you 1/4 inchers."
3,Yoga instructor reviews this bag,"The Sierra bag would be perfect if it were 2 inches longer. It's a struggle to stuff and pull out any size mat because the bag is too short. I'm a yoga instructor who teaches hundreds of classes and although I love all the other features of the bag -- cell phone and water bottle pouches; ample storage pocket for my CDs, lavendar, and papers; and cushy strap -- I hesitate recommending my students buy one for themselves because of the height issue."
3,yoga bag,"It's a nicely designed bag, but I returned it because it was too much of a struggle to get my yoga mat in."
4,ALMOST PERFECT,"This bag is so cool! It has a great strap, many compartments, water bottle holster, and space for clothing. Very good quality, especially for $19.99 ""on sale"" price.Only setback is that it won't fit a Manduka Mat (it is 2"" wider than most). JUST ADD 2"" to the length of the bag. PLEASE!!!"
4,Definitely worth four stars.,"Folks-Obliterati performed atypical dance music in Central Florida in the mid/late 90s, combining influences of NYC downtown circa '81, champagne, a love for Something Weird, and mainly just a desire to make their own music. 'Twas evident at their shows, too. This record is a more refined Obliterati, with detailed digital production, and though the beats are present, headphones make a fine addition when listening. They were signed to Whirlybird by Silver Apples' Simeon, who warmly embraced the band and took them on tour."
2,Obliterati - 'Havy Baubaus Inflience' (Whirlybird Records),"First, and from what I could tell - the only (at least, so far) CD by this Florida based funk band. Definitely too roots rock-ish for me. Some would most likely tag this music as 'mutated disco' - I'll go with that. Reason I even took time to listen to this title was because it was put out on Whirlybird Records - the Silver Apple's one-time residence."
1,Not the BUCK that we've come to know and love.,"the knife had rust/stains on the blade and in the handle, the quality of the steel is questionable, the numbers weren't stamped all the way on the blade. This is NOT the BUCK that we've come to know and love."
3,Buck knives made in China???,"Very sharp, neat looking knife probably well worth the price. NOT MADE OF USA STEEL."
2,Not your father's knife,"I have been carrying this knife for about two months. It seemed like a well made knife, but after two months, the finish had already worn off the handle just from carrying in my pocket. Made in China. Not the Buck knife that was once worth seeking out."
4,Very Small Little Knife,"Obviously for the price you arent getting some big survival knife....this thing is about 2 inches long or so, but thats why I bought a pair of them, I wanted a small knife to keep in my pocket for little jobs....if thats all YOU'RE wanting, then this is perfect for you.."
3,A strong reissue but with competition,"This is one of Gardiner's earliest recordings, from the days when the Monteverdi Choir were breaking new ground with their namesake's Vespers, and it stands the test of time well, but there is a more recent 1980s take on the Seven Words by Rene Jacobs. The choice will probably depend either on whether you like Schutz with a Cambridge accent or a more Parisian feel, or simply on the other items on the CDs. Gardiner's recording, dating from the vinyl era, naturally has less playing time but includes some good dialogues from Symphoniae Sacrae Opus 12 including Mein Sohn, warum hast du uns das getan? which takes the question of Mary in Luke2:48 and the response of the twelve year old Jesus as the text (although this performance is technically not as flawless as the one on the complete Opus 12 set by Bernius). Meanwhile Jacobs packs his Seven Words disc with nine other short pieces."
4,Good recording,"I bought this as a practice recording (I'm singing the part of Jesus). My only quibble: I wish the producer had split the 7 Words recording into multiple CD tracks, 1 per movement. It was difficult having to fast-forward and rewind through the entire piece."
5,daughter's favorite,"Daughter, 9 loves the original story with Hillary Duff. This is a repurchase after her original was damaged.Rating based on a 9 year old's opinion, not mine as a grown up."
4,Good dvd,"It was a good DVD. It has one side with Cinderella Story, and the other side with Another Cinderella Story. Both stories are good."
5,Delicious Horror,"Kim Harrison delivers a winner in this third installment of the Rachel Morgan series. Rachel is a witch and a bounty hunter who hunts down werewolves, vamps and such. Like most of us, Rachel makes mistakes, but her mistakes are liable to cost her her life and if that's not bad enough; there's the threat of eternal damnation.This novel is action packed with sassy dialogue, scary horror that has you looking over your shoulder in fear, and really steamy sex scenes. Whew! I loved it."
5,Still pleasing!,"Once again, I was not disappointed, and was well drawn into the story. I am looking forward to the next book to see how some of the storylines work their way out, especially Rachel's encounter with Piscary's lawyer."
5,"Still amazing, but liked the 2nd one better...","Let me preface this by saying that Kim Harrison is my favorite author. I read this 500 page book in one 12-hour sitting (i guess devoured is more like it). Kim Harrison's writing style is just incredible - the way she is always mindful of the ways thing smell and taste - reminds me of J.K. Rowling and makes for one of the fullest reading experiences I've ever had. That said, this book didn't have a plot. No murders to solve, or name to clear - it was just 500 pages of a few days in the life of Rachel Mariana Morgan - which I am grateful for, but still would have liked a plot."
2,Underwhelming,"Hmmm, this book was very underwhelming for me. It seemed to drag on and on and the story and characters never grabbed me. This time around Rachel has love life problems, demon troubles, elf woes, pixie-man friction and the usual vampire struggles with her roommate/business partner Ivy who wants to be more than friends. She also has to face up to her deal with the demon Al that she made in the last book. And then there's the master vampire and other assorted issues she must deal with here. Honestly, there was so much going on that I found myself lost for much of it. My focusing problems weren't helping matters out either. I feel the same way about this book as I did the last. It needs humor (I keep reading reviews calling it ""light, fun, funny, etc. but I'm not seeing it) and more emotional ties to get me to care about the characters. I don't know if I'll bother to continue with the series at this point."
2,Not So Good,"I enjoyed the first two books and was looking forward to enjoying this one too. The Rachel character has become too ditzy. The final straw for me was going on a date with Kisten! He's a scummie male but Rachel is so desperate to go out she would rather go out with a scummie male the a female who cares for her and protects her. What a slap in the face Joy. No matter how good, caring Joy is, she can never be as good as a sorry guy.No more of these stories for me."
5,Third times a charm,If you enjoyed the first two you'll enjoy reading this one just as much. Great plot. I highly recommend it.
4,Another strong entry in the series.,This series gets better and better. The relationships and the possibilities for the supporting characters are starting to click. Elves are going to start to intrigue you as well as vamps and demons. Just as a side note-whoever does the proofing needs to be whipped with wet noodles. Very jarring!!
4,this book rocks,i really enjoyed this book. It was actually very well written to have so many paranormal elements in one book. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Good series,"I am looking forward to the next installment of the series. I thought they were all a good read. I would LOVE to see more of Ceri, and think she will end up being a powerful ally."
3,She switches teams.,"My wife enjoyed this series up until this book. This is where things start getting really murky.Personally, I would say that the book was written around the time of strong feminine anti-heros, and the character reminds me a lot of Willow from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Imagine if they had continued to develop Willow's character steadily down the dark path.Spoiler alert: she switches teams. She's now a ... dare I say the word...Demon!"
4,Good Story But the Myriad Typos are Aggravating (Book 4),"I just started reading this series on Kindle. I really like the characters and the stories are quite entertaining but, sheesh, the typos are so distracting! Jenks is worried about his son Jenks, Walter's name occasionally appears as Water, characters are ""accessing the damage"" rather than assessing it, and there must be something new called a ""mute point"" rather than the more well-known moot point. And these are not isolated incidences. There are probably a hundred of them in this book alone. The first three books had crazy typos, too, but of the four volumes I've read so far, this one is the worst in terms of quality control. Publishers have a high profit margin on the Kindle versions of their books. How about spending a little of it on a proofreader?"
5,The Best So Far,"I am currently on the 5th book in the series (I am hooked), but this has been my favorite so far. I love the characters! I felt like I got a little closer to them when I read this one."
3,Every Which Way but Dead,"The story line had potential to be exciting, and the book started off with action. Unfortunately the author developed the lead character, Rachel Morgan, into a sex starved witch who evaluated each male (elf, werewolf, vampire, even demon) she encountered from a sexual standpoint. It was really annoying when it became so pervasive, maybe she was writing to other women.Additionally, the author allowed the lead character to squeak out of mistakes through luck instead of clever intelligence. And the constant whining by the lead character of negative events that were affecting her also annoyed me. I wanted the lead character to take charge and develop into a strong person, and kept listening to the book because of tantalizing moments of action in which the heroin succeeded in overcoming the challenge of the moment.Still frustrating waiting for those moments, and having to listen to the constant whining and sexual evaluations of the males in the book."
5,This series of books are a drop jaw experience!!!,"I like scifi-fantacy, I don't read much & I am more a visionary/movie type person. So when I had picked the first book of this series I could not put it down. I am on the third book Every Witch Way but Dead. I am in love with Rachel, Ivy and Jenks. I am drawn into the book like a moth to a flame. You can imagine this saucy ballsy lil lady going up against the most dangerous of entinies. I have to go I need to turn the page."
3,Fun read for what it is.,The book was a nice continuation of the Rachel Morgan story that answered some questions and asked a few more. I was worried at first that the story would shift like the Anita Blake novels to a more Adult sex book than vampire book but with the exception of one or two PG13 parts the story stayed on course and developed nicely. Far from a master piece of modern literature but a fun read for what it is.
4,makes me want to read more,This book like the others are something to read to get out of your daily stressful life and put your self in to it by kicking some vampire butt or not at the same time. Its a joy to read.
1,trailer trash,"If you like woman that is abused but refuse to leave her abuser. then the main character of this book is for you. Rachael Morgan is a trailer trash witch, She is appalled here old boy friend is a thief, But is now sleeping with a mass murderer. After reading 3 of these books the only thing that would get me to read another is a promise of the death of the main character. It is a shame that the author has created a Cool ""world"" then peopled with trash-Uninteresting trash at that."
5,Best I've Seen So Far.,"I would not have written this review if I didn't see the review by j.guy@soandso (The cute penguin) but after reading this book and thinking it was great I went back to the book and looked up his complaints. By golly he was right! But unfortunately he missed one important point that even the 5 star reviewers did. This book is not the first Linux book you should read! Sobell's book went as smooth as silk for me, but that was after reading both the Red Hat 6.0 manuals front to back and then Linux for Dummies (ok hold on, it only took me 2.5 hours to read so stop laughing). So this book is truely a 5 star book, but probably won't be alot of help to you until you've read about and experimented with some really basic features of the OS. This book should be on your bookshelf and after I read a couple other ones (this level and up) I may come back and review it again just to make sure I'm 100% right."
5,"bought it 6 months ago, STILL use it!","This book is great! I don't care what anyone else says, this is the perfect book for Linux users. I own over 25 books on or related to UNIX/LINUX, and this one is the only one I really go back to (well, this one and Linux the Complete Reference, but that is more a collection of HOWTOs). It is the only book I refer to for an explanation of why something works such-a-such way in Linux. The book is serious enough to talk about shell programming, but also goes over access permissions, networking, and things like vi. It also has some pretty cool man-type pages in the back with examples.If you are looking for a book that specifically tells you how to set up you ISP connection or ethernet card, look for Linux, The Complete Reference. (A Walnut Creek CDROM book)"
3,Not for the unix expert,"Got this in last night and sent it back today. Appears to be a very good book for the beginner.If you are a unix expert already its not for you. You, like me, are probably looking for the quickie knowledge transfer book."
2,Too Unorganized,"Although ""A Practical Guide to Linux"" is comprehensive,it isn't focused or organized.I can't use it as a reference for that reason-it's too much of a bother to gather all the bits and pieces of information scattered about the book.I instead reach for O'Reilly's ""Running Linux"",which i would recommend you do also."
4,A first Reference for Linux,"Great work from Mark Sobell... this man is really good! . I'm constantly returning to this book as a reference. It's more recommended for newbies , as it goes through all unix world (concepts,basic commands,shells,etc..) but after you get experienced you'll use it as good reference for some doubts. the main commands are all there with all those -xxxxxx options indeed. I also agree with one of the reviews that said that it needs some new review as it was written is 1997, but it's still a very good value book. Every admin should have one in the shelf."
4,Back Cover Description,Chaplain Harry Howard has been a protestant chaplain at San Quentin for 14 years. His dynamic ministry has led thousands from crime to Christ.
1,Starts off strongly but declines into unbelievability,"The film starts off strongly with intriguing by-play between two police detective partners. But then they're given a homicide to investigate and things decline from there. The main suspect comes to be a brilliant young female prosecutor, who just happens to be deaf and dumb. The plot unfolds just too fancifully and unbelievably. The characters become ever more cardboardy. A shame, since in the early scenes the film did show promise of being interestingly edgy and taut."
1,Like Bad Kareoke Versions of the Originals,Who knows what happened here on this album? You would think that after singing these songs for over twenty years the singer might improve upon the originals. No chance. These new renditions are uninspired and almost robotic in tone. Don't buy this unless you enjoy being disappointed.
1,Author is a discredited anti-semite,"Piper is a far-right extremist and well-known anti-semite. The book is full of anti-semitic, nonsensical conspiracy theories."
5,assasin motivations.,"This is the most plausible scenario I have ever heard about the JFK affair, but, it goes without saying, almost unthinkable to suggest it publicly."
1,Blinded by Hate,"This book is an exercise in tedium. Boring and poorly written, this book was produced mainly for Piper's fellow anti-semites who will eat up every pseudo-revelation of Israel's perfidity. It comes as no surprise to learn that Piper is also a Holocaust denier. Blinded by hate, Piper sees a Jew in every woodpile. The main thing I learned from this book was that apparently it is now possible to prove that ANYBODY killed Kennedy. Just pick candidate and then throw around wild and spurious accusations, then Unfortunately Amazon doesn't allow ratings in the negative numbers."
5,Filling in the gaps,"After spending several days on beautiful Monhegan Island with a friend who has been there every summer for twenty years, I had become quite familiar with its summer life. This book, complete with photos of residents and stories of their personal lives and family histories, showed me what it meant to live on the island year-round. The personal stories were an effective touch, as the island is naturally a very personal place with its 75-resident winter population and 700 more in the summer. I highly recommend this book, especially to those who wonder what happens to Monhegan in the winters."
1,All Amazon TVs are refurbished,"I purchased one from Amazon. When it was delivered and installed, I realized that it was a refurbished with a big stamp on the user manual and red ink to cross out the serial number at the back of the TV. The front black frame was falling off. I wanted Amazon to replace it with a new one. Amazon customer service agreed that what was advertised should be new TV. But, they were not able to find a new one so I was offered a refund. The problem is that I need to call Dish HD to cancel HD installation (if possible, etc.) and take another day off to wait for the pick up.Do not buy this TV from Amazon unless you like used plasma TV."
2,buy phenolic,Well I ordered two of these a year ago and im not happy with the product. I received one that was warped right out of the box but the other was flat. Peachtree insisted that if i put the warped one under clamps it would flatten out. I left it clamped between plywood for a week and it was still warped. The return process seemed like a hassle. The other one has since warped on me. Do yourself a favor and buy a phenolic insert or blanks and make them. UHMW just isnt a suitable material for this. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because I think I should have been a smarter consumer and known UHMW would suck for this application. Atleast the dimensions were what they said they'de be.
5,Wonderful!!,"I have watched all her cooking shows on youtube as well, and will be ordering the book and dvds. What can I say about nana Clara that hasn't already been said? She makes you feel like you're one of the neighborhood kids that no doubt tramped through her kitchen over the years. She cooks basic food that is cheap and simple. Her stories from the Depression era are told with humor and common sense. Indeed watching her makes me feel like I have a grandmother again. Thanks nana Clara. You make my heart smile!!!"
1,Bruckner is hardly Abbado's composer,"This recording was actually recorded ages ago before DG released it. One wonders why they bothered at all! Abbado approaches the piece with a highly neurotic touch, yet without reaching the dramatic heights of the likes of Hans Knappertsbusch, Furtwaengler and Jochum. Instead, it sounds incoherent and muddly. Go for Knappertsbusch if you want convincing drama. Go for Guenter Wand's wonderful BPO recording or Giulini's VPO recording for an interpretation from the other pole."
4,A little snug,"This is a fantastic buy for the price. It feels great! The only drawback is that its a little small for my queen size bed. If I could do it over again, I would buy a king size to better accommodate my bed."
4,"Aeolus Microsuede Full/Queen 3-Piece Down Comforter Set, Purple",Nice comforter. Not the thickest but for the price I cant complain. I would recommend a King size for a queen size bed since it barely hung down to the bottom of the first mattress.
2,A lot in this book was rather familiar.,"Even before I was halfway through this book, I knew why it some of the plot and the characters seemed familiar. They have a definite resemblence to George MacDonald Fraser's ""Flashman and the Great Game."" The Russian Count, the faithful Pathan servant Ibrahim Khan, the main character's native squeeze, the Thugs. Need I go on?This novel was entertaining, but Flashman and the Great Game is a much better book, without the silly premise."
2,Implausible and Stilted,"Steve Stirling's Peshawar Lancers starts off with an interesting premise: that European civilization is nearly destroyed in 1878 when a disintegrating comet rains down on the northern hemisphere. Unfortunately that is where the innovative ideas end. Instead of seeing how the rest of the world develops in that power vacuum Stirling assumes that British simply relocated to India and gives us a rehash of the Flashman novels. Peshawar Lancers takes place about 150 years after The Fall (as he calls it) and there has been very little technological, sociological, or geopolitical change in that period. It seems that Stirling wanted to freeze history rather than explore the genuine alternative history that would arise in his scenario."
2,Disappointing,"After reading his Island trilogy, I was disappointed by this effort.It seemed juvenile and simplistic. I reminded of the movies serials I watched as a child. The characters were two dimensional and uninteresting.I expect more from this author."
2,Standard Stirling Fare,"Stirling puts together his usual entertaining story, unfortunately, also with his usual casual racism. His nostalgia for the old British empire is unsurprising, given his attitudes about the superiority of Europeans in general and the inferiority of Muslims in particular, and it screams out very loudly in this book.The main difference between this book and most of Stirling's imperial fantasies is that the main character isn't a violent bisexual/lesbian. If you like Stirling, hey, he's here in all his glory."
4,In the tradition of Kipling and George MacDonald Fraser....,"....but not to Kipling's literary standards and without the skill, storyline and characterisation of Fraser's ""Flashman"" novels. It doesn't have anything like the depth and literary charm of ""Kim"" for example, or the sheer humor of the Flashman novels but it's a fun read all the same if you like the genre and the premise - the alternative history scenario is probably the best part of the book, the plot's fun - the character's are rather stereotypical but the action scene's are good - one of Stirling's strong points in all of his books.All the same and despite the weak points, I enjoyed it tremendously - as I enjoy almost all of Stirling's books - and would recommend it as a good light read. I'd certainly look forward to more of the same."
4,"Lancers, Forward!","I have only one gripe! Ignatieff really needed to survive for at least one more book before being killed off. I mean, he was such a nicely crafted EVIL opponent that I really hated seeing him die... However, except for that one change, I found Peshawar Lancers to be a thoroughly engaging novel that swept me along with the racing tide of events. Don't get me wrong. I love the Island series for the richness and detail that has been poured into each book, but 'The Peshawar Lancers' was pared down just enough, in my opinion, to create more of a fast-paced thriller effect rather than the sweeping flow of time and tide that you feel when reading and of the 'Island' books.I'm looking forward, impatiently, for the next Captain King adventure!"
3,Flashman with the serial numbers filed off.,"Great book! I really enjoyed it under its original title ""Flashman and the Great Game"" by George MacDonald Fraser."
4,Alt-history swashbuckling goodness!,"The Peshawar Lancers is an excellent novel. Stirling's world is an earth that unlike ours, had a great cataclysm befall it, resulting in Western Europeans migrating to their equatorial colonial holdings. The resulting cultures, primarily dealt with is the English-Indian nation called the British Raj, are interesting and believable. I fully believe Stirling did a great deal of research, resulting in a thought-provoking and well-illustrated milieu. The feel of the narrative evokes the older swashbuckling movies, with airships added for flavor. A must for anyone looking for a steampunk-lite swashbuckling journey!"
2,An intentional G.M. Fraser derivative?,"Certainly not up to the standard of Fraser's excellent Flashman series! I can't help but think it must be intentionally paying homage to its superior, and to other Northwest Frontier fiction and nonfiction. The ""native"" detail which impresses some reviewers could have been lifted straight from Fraser and from John Masters' autobiographical ""Bugles and a Tiger"". But where Stirling seems to be winking at us is in naming the Pathan who eventually accompanies the Anglo-Indian protagonist and his Sikh brother-in-arms: Ilderim Khan. As any Flashman fan knows, this is the name of Flashman's alter ego when in disguise as a Pathan. After encountering this character, it's rather hard to think the rest is anything but a bit silly."
3,"Decent, but not his best work","Peshawar Lancers isn't Stirlings best work. The premise is a fascinating one: a cometary impact starts a new ice age in the Northenr hemisphere in the 1870s and the British empire relocates to India. Stirling devotes his usual impecable detail to creating a large and robust world for his characters to play in, but the characters themselves are largely bland and the story is a few twists and turns short of a great adventure yarn. THere are also some plausibility problems with some of the elements of the world he has created (the villains are satan worshipping canibalistic Russians who have survived intact in Central Asia). I'd recommend it for Stirling completists or fans of pulp adventure fiction, but it's not a must read."
2,Had to put it on the try again later shelf.,Story dragged a lot. I read this after I read several of the other S. M. Stirling novels. Not a book to take on the over night flight...
3,When the Rudyards cease from kipling...,"Stirling is an enjoyable writer of alternative history, and _The Peshawar Lancers_, while not his best work, is thoroughly enjoyable. Stirling has produced a pastiche British imperial era adventure story, with echoes of Kipling and Haggard, and a tribute to Poul Anderson (to whom the book is dedicated) in the form of a nice bit of lifting from one of Anderson's ""Time Patrol"" stories.His vision of India is Kiplingesque, though he does not have Kipling's ability to breathe depth into his characters (at least in this story), and the echoes of _Kim_ here and there are delightful."
3,"Very good book, but not his best (slight spoiler warning)","Stirling is an excellent writer, and this is a fast-paced, enjoyable, readable book with his usual rich world-building behind it. With that said, and much as I enjoyed the book, I don't think it's among his best. Alternate history is one of Stirling's fortes, and this book is no exception...but he also excels in the series, which allow his cast of characters to develop over time, and lets events proceed without immediate resolution. Perhaps that's why I find this book a little disappointing: the way that the big bad villain gets axed and all the likeable major characters are happily paired off by the end of the book makes it pretty obvious that there's to be no sequel. No problem with that, I just felt that the evil-is-vanquished-happily-ever-after ending was a little forced. I'd buy it again, though. Any Stirling fan will like this one."
3,coin wrapper,product was as advertised. would like to be able to purchase specific denomination coin wrappers rather than receiving equal numbers of all denominations.
1,"wasted money, trying to save money!","I purchased this, in order to try and save time and money, sorting my coins. This thing jammed during the first session. A coin got inside the unit. It took about 10-minutes to get it out. Then, another got jammed inside of 5-minutes (again). In trying to free this coin (from inside), the thing broke! Its cheap plastic."
3,"Reviewing the wrappers, not the coin sorter itself","The coin wrappers are nice to have and they work well enough with a few taps into the machine's coin tubes. My complaint about the coin wrappers: the box provides you with an equal number of wrappers for all coins. Although at first blush this may seem like a good idea, in practice I've found that I get far more quarters as change than nickels or dimes, or even pennies. Therefore, I am now top heavy with nickle, dime and penny wrappers and almost out of quarter ones. This is a small complaint mind you. Coin wrappers can easily be procured at any bank to make up the difference, they're just not pre-packaged as nice round tubes from that source like these are."
4,easy to use,I recommend the use of these rollers with automatic coin counters. They do not tear quickly and fit the counter I purchased.
2,I'd stay out of this kitchen......,"Usually, I love Sherryl Woods' books. However, while ""What's Cooking"" starts out ok, it quickly loses what little steam it had in the beginning. The ending seems thrown together, and the story itself is just not well thought out. All in all, I would not purchase this book again. It immediately went in my ""to donate"" pile!"
3,Great Toy but Book Isn't actual Cat in The Hat,My 6 mos old loves the cat in the hat stuffed animal but I wassad to see that the book included is not the Real Cat In The Hat(The Dr. Suess version) It's the movie version a story aboutthe events of the movie. Still a really great price and a really cute stuffed toy.
3,disapointing,ASIN:B00006HXWG Belkin F1D9400-06 Dual Port PS/2 & VGA Bonded Cable]]I would love two review if could have them I have waited nearly 2 months lots of excuses I cannot beleave I still havent receved them VERY ANGRY RICHARDBelkin F1D9400-06 Dual Port PS/2 & VGA Bonded Cable
2,"Gospel, without the Soul","If you were introduced to this band by Rounder's ""Handpicked"" comp's inclusion of ""every humble knee"", don't even waste your time with the rest of this album. Some of the songs on here are just OK and some just downright boring. The instrumental work is decent but nothing on the album makes up for the painful repititousness of ""Goodnight, the Lord is coming"" and ""Drifting Away"" or the draggingly dull a capello, ""To Be His Child"". If your looking for some bluegrass gospel with soul, check out Ralph Stanely's ""While the Ages Roll On"" or, ""Answer The Call""."
5,"What you always expected about Italy's cops, with a twist","Reading Aurelio Zen out of sequence is as sensible as the mystery in this book. And figuring out which of the several plot lines represents the mystery is half the fun. Picaresque is the only description for Zen. And the other characters! You get to meet every Italian you've ever known, with a couple of true-to-life foreigners thrown in. Truly delightful if you have a sense of humor and a taste for the absurd. A disaster if you like a lot of senseless violence and macho language in your mysteries. Aurelio Zen has a new fan in me."
5,A detective story of character and humor,"A literate and thoroughly enjoyable read if you like (a) opera, (b) Italy, (c) humor, or (d) classical Chandler/Hammet mysteries. The violence is limited (thankfully), the characterizations are sharp and funny, and the parallels to the Mozart opera, though not necessary to enjoy the book, provide an extra layer of delight. Dibdin is probably not for everyone; if you like exceptional tension or violence, this is not for you. But if you enjoy very skillful use of language and turns of phrase, along with a burlesque of Italian (and other) life, you are sure to enjoy this."
3,"Love the Zen, not the farce.","Dibdin excels (usually) when Zen is the focus of his intricate and interesting plots. Unfortunately, he only carried me so far this time. Yes, it is a farce with great promise -- and Dibdin plays very well with the original Cosi fan tutte -- but in my humble opinion, he copped out in the last two chapters. The surreal resolution of the intricate set-up just didn't work for me, in part because his stylistic choice of the self-consciously ironic narrator did not produce a compelling description of the action and resolution of the plot. It was like seeing a play that should have been funny, but was poorly directed.With all of that being said, I of course went out and got the rest of the Zen books -- even when Dibdin fails, the results are better than most other stories out there!"
2,Disappointing,"Mystery fans will be disappointed. Dibdin writes in an artsy rather than tensely suspenseful style, yielding self-consciously amusing ironies and operatic coincidences. For example, he blatantly repeats one gory scene verbatim. The frivolous confections and literary stylings quite canceled the mysteries for me. Throughout the author is clearly ""playing with"" his characters (and you) in three parallel, increasingly coincident, story lines. There is some amusing word play, but if you want that then Mozart's operatic version sounds better. Dibdin's characters are more interesting than the plot, but not much. I imagine committed PC people will really hate the stereotypes, and the impolitic disparagement of Naples (a stand-in for humanity). The conclusion is too much of a rush (but with wonderful inversions of character). This is quite an amusing book, but not the involving mystery I expected."
4,Editing?,"Apparently this e-book is produced by scanning a hardcopy. The software gets confused quite often, introducing myriad typos. Amazon stinks at quality control, otherwise known as editing."
2,kindle riddled with typos and confusion!,"This is a review of the kindle edition. The novel itself is entertaining and well done. And surprisingly funny.My problem is with the the digital transfer. Rarely a page goes by without a typo, misspelling or just plain confusing conjunction of letters and symbols.This book is not offered for free. We are expected to pay for it and should be given a decent copy. Since there is essentially no overhead to kindle books, I think the least they can do is proof and correct them.I guess that is my rant for now. And I apologize to all for giving it a low rating. The novel deserves a four. The Kindle edition deserves the two."
4,Pretty hilarious,"I'm not a fan of the late Anna Nicole Smith, but I felt sorry for her and didn't hate her. She was definitely HOT when she first arrived on the scene in the 1990s, but the furor of media coverage during her fight for the hundreds of millions of dollars her late husband left her seemed to have gotten to her. I found episodes of her reality TV show to be pretty hilarious, if not a little exploitive and over-the-top. However, I didn't think she was much of a talent...until I happened upon Illegal Aliens, the comedy released after her untimely and unfortunate death. Sure, this isn't a superstar film, but it's hilarious--and I'm not even a fan of hers! The movie makes fun of so many things that it's hard not to laugh. Anna is surprisingly good in her part. I'm sure most people will diss this movie, but Illegal Aliens is a great laugh if you have nothing else to do."
1,awful,hilariously awful you mean? i can't believe some of these reviews have 5 stars i bet you anything they didn't even watch it or they are the one's trying to sell it on amazon. this movie was dreadfully stupid and i feel sorry for her and daniel to be a part of it. rest in peace anna and daniel.
1,ok if you are retarded,"This piece of garbage makes early John Waters films look like masterpieces.Towards the end Anna Nicole's character leaves the scene to go relief herselfwhile the other two ""Meryl Streeps"" contine talking. What follows is an arrayof loud flatulence sounds. Hilarious. This is the only two minutes worthwatching on this ""film"". OOPS! Meant to say filth."
1,bad,the acting is so bad I don't really know what to say but the movie is not even worth the time watching it even if you got it for free
1,Don't waste your money,"This movie is an insult to Anna Nicole's memory which says a lot when you remember she was a gold digging, fat, whiny drug addict it is hard to insult her.It will make you uncomfortable, squirm with embarrassment for the bad acting in this film by both her and Chyna doll.Blacks hate being portrayed as shucking and jiving, well this is another film where woman are portrayed as the dizzy, dumb blond version of shucking and jiving and it is just as uncomfortable to watch. It is humiliating."
5,A novel Par Excellence,"A first time author of Indian Origin has joined the company of the more established ones of the same genre. Comparisons can be odius as well flattering. Baqir Shameem is original to the core and honest to the bone. May his tibes grow by the dozen.Giving any further details about the book would do injustice to its potential readers. Enjoy the thrill, the joy and the intriguing pages of the book. Happy reading."
1,Not worth the money,This is a pretty dismal album. I suggest saving your money and not purchasing it.
5,waiting for season three,I never watched the flying nun as a child and only discovered the show recently. I enjoyed season one and two so much that I can't wait until the release of season three.
5,Great,I forgot just how funny these show were. If you like old old TV shows you will enjoy these. Great
1,Author is out of touch,"I'm sorry to report that Alan Cooper appears to be years out of touch with the software industry. He lobbies for a new 'interaction design' class of professionals working toward designing how the user sees the system - but the industry started doing these things a good 15-20 years ago. Also, he assertions that ""in software, typically nothing is visible until it is done"" is just plain wrong today; 20 years ago that was true but the software industry today uses storyboards, paper usability reviews, UI mockups, prototypes, etc all with the intent of designing a user friendly interface before the first line of code is written. He starts off with flawed assumptions and ignorance and goes downhill from there.For simple entertainment value and getting to vent frustration about bad systems I give the book 1 star, but if you're actually serious about understanding and improving software development, you're much better off reading any of a handful of books about ""use case analysis""."
2,Blown out of proportion,"It's true that some products have poor interfaces, but in my experience this ""problem"" is blown way out of proportion with reality. The only people I know who couldn't figure out how to program their VCRs were people who did not try for more than 5 minutes. Read the instructions, both in the book and onscreen, and VCR programming is a snap, from the earliest models to today.I think the real question should be: Why are so many users so lazy? This is more of a social problem than a technological one. Some think that if any effort is required to learn how to use a new device then it's poorly designed. Poppycock!"
3,You're blaming the wrong people!,"In my experience with system design, it is rarely the engineers who add the ""extraneous"" features. We're a lazy bunch and like to design to spec. It's the non-technical people...the marketing department, the customer reps, who blather about the software doing this and that and the customer bites. The customer thinks they get all these great features, but when the technical folks try to explain why it's a bad idea, managment says ""Just put it in, we already promised them.""Besides, who says you HAVE to upgrade?? Most people upgrade because they believe they need all the 'new features' the next version has. I'm sure you've realized that nobody is fixing bugs in these new versions...ahem..windows..ahem..."
2,Mealy-mouthed whining at its very best,"Alan Cooper begins the book by accurately defining the software and application development model that pervades industry today. This lucid and insightful analysis is worth the two stars this book earned. However, as the book progresses it never fulfills even a smidgen of the promise we are lured into believing will materialize for us, should we choose to read the entire treatise. A tight concise target is identified early in the book and then this gem of an idea unravels into a slurry of whimpering diatribes that provide no useful information whatsoever. This book is fraught with good intentions and chalk full of pure ""crap""."
5,"Better software design, part II","Alan's books should be required for all programmers. College computer curriculums should require interaction design as well. This book, and Alan's first book are both great reading. They are humorous and yet highly valuable. The only regret I have is that the books point out all the little things that software does to annoy that I might not have noticed before..."
3,"Not a Silver Bullet, but Cooper is worth reading !","You might say that some of Cooper's contentions are bias since as a Design Consultant his team doesn't actually have to DELIVER applications on time, in budget, in the ""real world"" !I disagreed with much of what Alan Cooper says in this book, but, I also think that Cooper is a visionary and his books have definately helped me deliver better solutions to my customers, and for THAT he has my thanks.This book SCREAMS for a ""how to"" technical follow on book that teaches his detailed design techniques. I'll probably disagree with much of that book too - but I'll be early in line to get my copy !Joe@ASPGurus.com"
1,Misguided,"Although the goal, usable software applications, is noble, Alan Cooper is misguided in placing the blame on the engineers.Feature creep is often caused by business and marketing professionals, as they think piling on more features will make it the product more desirable.Project plans and specifications are usually poorly planned, which leads directly to engineering problems. Perhaps the business/product management side of the story needs the work."
2,Absurdities and Urban Myths ruin an otherwise valid point,"This author has lots of good points - unfortunately he attempts to illustrate his points with a series of ever more absurd examples and urban myths that he presents as facts.It has more in common with listening to a motivational speaker at a 3rd rate lecture than a well thought out book.He expands actual events into supporting arguments by completely ignoring the facts of the incident, and exaggerates some details completely out of proportion. How many people are unable to use a digital camera or a microwave as he claims?The concepts are good, but this book is in sore need of a real editor."
2,Mostly a rant,"From the first page this book shows itself to be the product of a lot of anger and not much thought or fact. The example of the American Airlines crash is glib and incorrect - 'pilot error' has not been given as a reason for a crash in many years. Similar problems occur thoughout the book - developers are lying when they say that something is technically difficult, using a knob rather than buttons is the answer to everything, design without regard to cost is the only way to do it. There are some ideas there but anything by Donald Norman is better. Like Clifford Stoll in ""High tech Heretic"" the author mistakes opinion for fact, and generalises with abandon. Yes, products are often poorly designed but all products are designed within constraints and ignoring them does not negate them."
5,one of the funniest books I've read in ages,"Cooper explains that he hates VB; it was meant to be a makeshift until someone could do the job right, but no one ever did- they used the kludge instead! He procedes to skewer most of modern-day software design, quite deservedly in my opinion. I spend a certain amount of my time telling my students that ""In Excel, the format category Accounting refers to currency symbols, and the format category Currency refers to accounting conventions,"" and ""The phrase Range_Lookup means 'do you want an exact match?' and if the answer is Yes, you have to type in FALSE."" So I am quite alert to how little attention programmers pay to the end users of software. I wish all programmers would read this book! For the rest of us- the end users, the teachers, the people who have to mediate between computers and the not-yet-computer-literate, this book is a great way to at least laugh about it, and to reassure yourselves that it's NOT YOUR FAULT that software seems so illogical!"
2,Ho hum. Should be half this thick.,"I found I really had to force myself to finish reading this book. The core concepts are covered in the first half of the book, albeit in a rather drawn out fashion, and the rest is simply reiteration and self-congratulatory rambling about the author's own successes and consulting business, masquerading under a thin guise of case studies.If the essence of this book could be distilled down into a 50 pager you'd have a winner."
3,for fun but not educational.,"You have to remember this book is written ~a decade ago. Some information is a bit old. It is ok to read.However, as a engineering student, I feel that he shouldn't place all the fault on the engineers. My impression of the book is that all the hassles and faults with computer lies with software engineers and managers, none on the users because you shouldn't have to learn it, ppl should know how to use it immediately.Read it for fun, there are some informative part, but take them with a grain of salt."
4,Technical Thuggery Unmasked!,"I've been developing software / designing databases for over 15 years, and while I've known about the problems Alan brings forth in this book, I was unwilling to face them head on. It's always beneficial to read ""opposing"" viewpoints, but many in the business carefully ignore this opportunity. Alan helps you think differently, sometimes striking a hidden nerve - proof that it's worth reading."
4,Review: Human Computer Interface,"Alan Cooper shares his observation of how the software development industry has evolved. The book is an easy read and is very insightful. If you have ever wondered why you can't program your VCR or why your children don't need to read the directions, this book will provide you with pragmatic reasons. Cooper is at times repetitive (I assume he is redundant in order to make his point clear to non-techi types). If you are a software programmer you will possibly find Alan Cooper's, The Inmates Are Running The Asylum "" to be frustrating or perhaps insulting. On the other hand, if you are a software user (the other 99% of the world) you may like that Cooper blames programmers for our inability to intuitively use technology, which he affectionately refers to as ""cognitive friction""."
1,Needs updating,"Written in 1999, I think this book is an example of how software used to be written. While Cooper's attitude in the book is annoying and frustrating, I found his views about software and it's process narrow minded. In the 1999s, when a software package was rather small, spending tons of time doing software documentation made sense. Nowadays, Cooper's methods no longer apply. If you want a book to use as a reference of how not to do current day software, buy this book, read it, and do everything opposite of what Cooper suggests."
1,Like reading a typical computer manual...,"The book starts out with some good examples of how putting computers into commonly used devices turns them into unusable devices (i.e. alarm clocks, VCRs, etc.) Unfortunately, his writing style is more like whining, and you just want to tell him if he's that annoyed with these products, just don't buy/use them! Get some common sense! As for the rest of the book, he may have had some valid ideas, but again, his writing style got in the way. It was like reading a computer manual - good reading if you want to get to sleep. I ended up skimming the headings, then placing the book in the recycling bin."
5,Great book - Makes a passionate case to move from developer cetric to customer centric,Great book - Makes a passionate case to move from developer cetric to customer centric. This the book that introduced the incredibly useful notion on Personas to the hitech world.
2,Change the world! But I'm not going to tell you how.,"I found this book to be an excellent review of design problems but it left me asking HOW HOW HOW? The author would tell me what NOT to do, but then shy away from telling me what TO do. He would outline a problem very eloquently, but then not tell me exactly how to solve it. ""We must design for the users!"" Um... yeah. HOW?If you have no clue about the problems that Interaction Designers face, read this book. If you are already an Interaction Designer, don't bother. I really hope there's a sequel in the works entitled ""The Interaction Designers are Running the Design Process: How To Solve Your Design Problems"" with lots of concrete examples and positive, rather than negative, design rules. Frustrating."
2,Could be a lot more dense,"This book could be a lot more dense; there are some interesting ideas, but theses could be presented on 80 to 100 pages easily. ""Interaction design"" is necessary, yes, I agree. But I don't like redundancy, at least not in such amounts.The cure that Cooper proposes for insanity-inducing high-tech products could lead to some improvements, but perhaps not more or less than usability engineering or any other structured, conceptual, mature approach."
4,Good thought work and methodology - An important read,"Alan Cooper, as seen in previous books, is able to get to the crux of the problem. If you can get past his self promotion, the book offers some helpful insights into process that I know I will be able to use in future designs.The biggest problem I see is that he doesn't offer any statistical evidence to back up anything he has done. His case studies represent interesting situations that look like there has been a drastic improvement in usability and usefulness. But how much of a change was it really? I'd like to know that compared to the original design, 45% of the users were able to complete the job faster, etc."
5,Computer Programming Thought Out,"The author, Alan Cooper, breaks apart the design cycle of creating software by separating the designer from coder. From experience and logic, he steps you around the traps while providing an easily followed track for producing a computer program.Think of this book (almost) as an introduction to his other book, ""About Face"", a text book which every programmer/analyst/designer should read."
4,Can interaction design really save the software industry?,"Alan Cooper wants nothing short of cultural change in the software industry. He wants to get programmers out of the business of deciding how humans will interact with computers. He asserts that interaction design specialists should do that. Interaction designers will create self-evident software to which customers will flock.Hear, hear -- but good luck. As long as software companies continue to be profitable with programmers doing interaction design, it's not likely to stop.Unfortunately, Cooper limits his book to the business case for interaction design. This omits the action step: how to effect that cultural change within a software company."
4,Required Reading for Web Designers,"And why not? As the Web matures it's becoming clear that it's a software platform not just a ""new medium."" Cooper's fundamental philosophy -- Goal Oriented, Task Based, Personas, Scenarios, etc. -- is easily translated for the creation, programming and deployment of Web-based applications and Web sites; including extended Internet developments that reach far beyond the wired Web.If more Web shops had adopted Cooper's philosophy and design principles, well there'd be more Web shops. Ha!"
5,Simply the best book on user interaction design,"If you find yourself bemused by the current woeful state of software usability, Alan's entertaining mix of invective, insight, and good advice will leave you practically ready to shout ""Hallelujah, Brother!"""
1,Derogatory and mediorce,"As an engineer, I found this book to be a poor assessment of how engineers think and how products should be designed. While there are some nuggets of truth and good advice buried in the pages, the tone of the author constantly de-humanizes engineers and devalues well-founded understanding of technology.The small benefit in design advice presented in this book is not worth the painful experience of reading it."
2,Disappointed - again,"I was reluctant to purchase this because I was disappointed in a Barbie workbook we purchased. This product had the same issues - I doubt that kids or teachers or parents were consulted in designing this game. First, you cannot set the levels. For ""awesome addition"" it started asking 8+0 for level 1 and then asked 15+8 (still in level 1). Then, in next level it asks questions like 37+24 (a big jump!). You can't stay in level one, which is frustrating. Other games were similar.In the shape game, you are told to put ""repeat the shapes in the right order"" but not told that the order is determined by the first to arrive at the right of the screen (not top to bottom - which is what my daughter and I both assumed). Furthermore, Barbie does not offer a clue as to why your daughter got it wrong 4 times.This is sad because girls love Barbie and she could do so much good if they would just consult anyone with a clue."
2,Boring Barbie,"This ""laptop"" is poorly designed, and pretty boring. The learning games are unimaginative and rote, and my daughter tired of it a day and has not touched it since Christmas. In addition, the ""parent annoyance factor"" is very high. Barbie has an extremely irritating voice, and she sounds like an over-exuberant airhead. After the 15th time ""Barbie"" said ""SUPER"" I was ready to toss the toy right out the window. Save your money and get some decent software for your home computer. There are some entertaining learning programs out there, and most can be had for a lot less than this toy."
3,"Nice toy, not as good with the actual usage","My 5 year old niece loves this as a toy, she carries it around and says she is working like mommy (also she has a princess cell phone). She is not at all interested in the games though ... the screen is too small and this is so backward in comparison to the Wii and real computer games she plays that she isn't interested.However, she loves it because it is her own laptop and she can carry it like a purse."
5,great item,"If you are an Irish Tenors fan, this is a must. The songs are warm, touching, funny, and at times, somber. These three voices blend so well! I highly recommend this video to you."
3,3 Irish Tenors,"The sound quality on this DVD is poor. Maybe it's because I got the DVD used because it is out of print. Maybe it's because Registration Hall at Ellis Island is not built for concerts. It is a nice, nostalgic concert, however, for Ellis Island and Irish Tenor fans."
2,Huge Plot Holes and Unbelievable Character,"The Orphan is not a fast paced film, and the acting is not the best. The real problem is that adoption procedure is not followed. The husband is to quick not to believe his wife when she says there is a problem (cliche). When one child is threatened and terrified, he says nothing to his parents and continues to sleep under the same roof as the psycho. Any child would talk rather than live with someone who puts a razor to his or her throat. There are other holes as well. It seems that wine sends people on an LSD trip in this movie. The director did not research adoption or child psychology to make this film. The movie is not believable. The viewer must look past all of the holes and simply be satisfied with a surprise ending (that really is not worth the price of this movie). The payoff does not save the film. See it on cable."
5,bitch from hell,"this person had some serious issues! a women trapped in a little girls body, who would have ever thought that. hell everyone is going to want her secret not ageing....ha-ha. this is a movie you have to stay in your seat and watch every minute of it."
1,Why does anyone like this movie?,"My brother-in-law had heard good things about this movie from a friend. He and I both like scary movies, so we went and saw it at the theater.First of all, it's not scary AT ALL.Second, it's stupid. It's so stupid that many people in the theater were laughing at it.Uh sure, if you want a movie with a ""twist ending""; this has one. Only you have to endure the whole movie just to see the twist, which isn't that interesting.My b-i-l said he was going to give his friend a really hard time for recommending this movie."
2,Just okay,"Passable because of decent acting by Isabelle Fuhrman. Just too long/ boring for what it is. See the Bad Seed 1957, which is similar but better."
4,Definitely worth a look...,"I love horror movies and psychological thrillers so I had to give this a look. If you have similar tastes you will definitely enjoy this. The little girl who plays Esther ""the orphan"" is amazing. So is Vera Farmiga, who plays the mother, otherwise known as ""the only character with any sense"". Even though I dislike movies where people do unbelievably stupid things, the fact is that real people do unbelievably stupid things in real life.I really enjoyed this movie. And I am looking forward to seeing more from the young actress who plays the title role."
5,buy it!,this movie is one of the best horror movies i've watched in a long time! the ending was something i didn't see coming at all! the newer horror movies are poorly budgeted remakes or nothing but a blood bath with no storyline. not this one.
5,a good thriller,it takes a lot to keep me at the edge of my seat and this one did. a thriller you would never forget. the negative reviews are these people watching the same movie. this movie was great. the girl played great as esther. well thats all i have to say. good-bye
5,Better than I thought,"I have avoided this Blu like the plague while perusing video stores. I thought, here is another horror movie about a little girl, so what? One day while watching HBO this movie came on. I decided to give it a try. My perceptions of this movie was TOTALLY wrong. This flick kept my interest from beginning to end. The suspense was major. And the twist was great. This is well worth the purchase."
4,Good One,It's a good suspense movie I saw after a long time and enjoyed watching it. The only thing is once you know what's the end of these movies don't feel like watching them again untill next couple years maybe. but it is good to watch it once for sure.
3,"Not bad, if you can sit through the first hour","After suffering the stillborn death of their daughter, a string of infidelities, and a drunk-driving accident that seemingly left their daughter Max mostly deaf, John and Kate have decided to adopt another child. Too bad this particular ""child"" happens to have the moral compass of Beelzebub. While the end offers enough twists and turns to satisfy fans of the genre, the movie as a whole could use more polish. It's slow to start and never fully develops any of its many (MANY) themes--adultery, adoption, mother's intuition, drug and alcohol abuse, child abuse, grieving, loss, marriage, postpartum depression, I could go on but I won't. 75% of the way through the movie, I became frustrated at how many eggs had been dropped and none of them picked back up. Points to the writers for trying to add some depth to the story, but sadly, the execution was lost in translation.You might also like:The Good SonThe Bad SeedThe UnbornRosemary's BabyThe Omen [Blu-ray]"
3,Cool Thriller,"The Orphan was pretty good. This is actually one of the few movies that I was able to watch these days. There are a lot of bad junk movies being released that I have had to turn off. I think this one was nice and suspenseful. If you like this, you might also like Chloe, Case 39, and Unfaithful."
5,CHUCKIE got nothing on THIS muderous miss!,"This movie is HANDS DOWN one of the most excellent THRILLER movies I have seen! Damion from ""The Omen"" and ""The Good Son"" ain't got NOTHING on THIS evil little girl! OR IS she a little girl after all??? It's a great thriller that builds up,you will not want (OR DARE!) to leave your seat 5 minutes into this film!The Children of the Corn are mere puff cakes compared to this missy of mayhem!Move over Chuckie,there is a new tiny terror in town!And her name is Esther!"
5,Wow...,"Wow, it's really hard to say anything about this movie without spoiling the whole point and the surprise. Isabelle Fuhrman as the ""Orphan"" gave a fantastic performance, and the whole film is much more mature, and surprising, then you'd expect. No devils or monsters here... it doesn't need one."
3,Orphan - good movie,"This is a good movie, not as scary as I had heard, but is ok. Not recommended for familty movie time."
3,Meet the dumb parents,"This movie is derivative and suffers from a predictable and lacklustre script. The performances are adequate but entirely unmemorable (in fairness to the two adult leads, however, they do play the most stupid parents ever). So it's a testament to the direction that it manages to entertain at all. But it does, thanks to Collet-Serra's tight grip on the material he's been given. Not much else to say really. It's all kind of so-so."
5,great suspense thriller,loved it ! great for suspense and thrilling too ! I love horror and movies that give you that unexpected ending and this movie is one of the few in my lifetime that revealed an ending I NEVER SAW COMING! Loved it Loved it Love it !
2,Looking for love in all the wrong places,"Poor Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman at 12 years). All she wanted was a little love. Unfortunately, there are a few obstacles to remove first. This takes planning, finesses, and a little collusion.This defiantly is not ""Dementia 13"" but it is a want-a-be. The film is highly predictable as most of the blood is in the first scene. That is because it was supposed to be a psychological thriller yet turned out to be a cheap slasher. The movie may be in a hurry to end but you do not have time to ward the unaware schnooks that they are about to be dispatched by a household utensil or the odd tool. The only spooky or over the top violence was when a poor defenseless pigeon was dispatched with force.Only saw the Blu-ray but nothing really looked fake on the big screen TV."
1,filmbuff,"This is a horrible film. It is slow and boring for the first 50 minutes. Then it began to show how a 9 year old child could brutally kill a nun! It continued with all destructive behavior, not just mildly destructive but to the extreme! Now we wonder how why our children have respect issues--- maybe it is because it is becoming socially acceptable. This movie had no content or reason to be made and is not worth the purchase price."
4,SUGAR AND SPICE and everything not nice.,"This is one creepy little girl and wait till you find out that she is......Well, watch the movie and you will find out. It was a thriller."
4,"Creepy and shocking, as it is supposed to be!","Isabelle Fuhrman is such a great actress that you will enjoy watching her being a creepy and evil teen aged girl. I'm not a big fan of this kind of movies but with great actors like Fuhrman, I can easily be converted!"
4,Much better than expected with an original twist tossed in,"This movie was better than expected with an original twist tossed in near the end. (even if you guess it about 5-10 minutes before revealed).It is strange that the father is so quick to defend the new orphan child and not his own family when strange things begin to happen, but they make this credible by portraying the father as a wimpy, useless father and husband.Great acting on the part of the young 13 year old actress who plays Esther in this film ........ she steals almost every scene she is in."
4,Color me Orphan,"I like this movie. Its not scary, but its just an entertaining, ""I don't have to think"" movie. And the Vera girl is wayyyy hot!"
4,I really like this film,This is a great movie with a good cast and that is well written and well acted. I wish I knew where to meet girls that have the same disorder as the orphan lol.She really is 100% bieleaviable both as an orphan and a methodical minipulative luinatic
5,Great Movie,"I first seen Orphan in theaters and thought it was great, and watching it on Blu-ray is just as great. The story is different than most scary films and the acting is terrific. The video quality and audio quality seemed great to me, though in a few scenes it got a little grainy. The Blu-ray Disc comes with some deleted scenes and an alternate ending which is creepier than the original ending. It also comes with a featurette called, ""Mama's Little Devils"" in HD, which takes a look at how Orphan was made and also other movies that feature children as killers. The featurette is good, but I was expecting more out of it. It also comes with a digital copy for a limited time only and the code can also be used for WB Insider Rewards. It was a great movie, but I would have liked more special features."
2,Not finished,"This was an ok movie...actually, i haven't finished it! Why? It's kind of 'same ol, same ol'....close to boring...I shut it off to finish at a later time..wouldn't buy it again."
1,Definitely Skip It!,"Although it starts off interesting because you want to know why this child is so disturbed, by the end you've just wasted your time on this movie. It is truly an unbelievable ending that you say to yourself, I've lost all that time watching this thing and will never get it back. The ending or even alternative ending is bad. If the ending was rewritten with a more believable story, we've heard about Russian orphans being neglected, abused and seen unbelievable horrors in their country in real life stories and the fallout after they've been adopted here in the States, that this movie just leaves you in disbelief. Good acting in the beginning and you are on the edge of your seat to know the outcome, so the screenwriter didn't need to go in the direction he did to make this a watchable movie, but he did and the movie ends up being just plain bad. Don't waste your time on this one!"
1,Most ridiculous movie I have ever seen!!!,"This movie is so stupid! How can anyone give this more than one star. Like the Husband in the movie is really going to fall for this kid/woman's stupid games. Oh God, I am so glad I did not see this in the theatre. Soooooo Lame!"
5,Watch this movie because the title character is way worse than Macauley Culkin in The Good Son,This movie is really long without hitting the ground running in terms of being entertaining so I kind of had it play in the background until the last fifteen minutes. The ending makes the entire movie worth watching.
3,Bah! It was almost like The Omen remake.,"Seriously. This movie reminds me of The Omen, only it wasn't creepy. It's really a rip off of Omen except with a realistic (sort of) twist instead of a possession thing."
2,No digital copy!,I got this and thought it would come with the slip cover and a digital copy but it does not.So if you follow the link from blu-ray.com to here the picture they have up is incorrect.SO just a heads head. Great movie. The girl is a great actress.
2,okay only really got good half way through,"I couldnt wait for this movie to hit theaters when i had seen it, it seemed a little slow for me i guess i expecited more half way through it got going and it wasnt really till the end of the movie it got really good with a huge twist i wasnt expecting, over all its okay to watch once and mabey own a copy of but i wouldnt spend a ton of money on that copy."
5,Thank Heaven For Little Girls...,"Esther (the astonishing Isabelle Fuhrman) comes into the lives of her new, adoptive parents (Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard). Esther is a lovely, brilliant girl w/ great artistic talent. Her new family, including a brother and sister, takes her into their home. They all live happily ever after. Um, no! You see, Esther isn't exactly a normal little girl. She is much more. Esther is a nightmare unleashed on these unsuspecting folks! She is... Different. ORPHAN is a tremendous thriller w/ a knock-you-dead twisty finale that absolutely satisfies! If someone tries to give this ending away before you see the movie, hit them in their big mouth! Buy immediately!... P.S.- I prefer the darker, much creepier alternate ending, but I'm a pretty creepy person!..."
5,awesome movie.,"wow. wasnt expecting this movie to be as awesome as it was. the girl who played the orphan could not have been more perfect. generally i cannot stand child actors...but lemme say this...THAT GIRL IS A INCREDIBLE ACTRESS. should of gotten a Oscar nod. absolutely.the movie : great story, acting was awesome, cinematography was brilliant and the level of violence/horror/drama was just the right amount to make it impossible to turn your eyes.love this movie. and recommend it highly."
3,3 by the lapse of the director,"The movie is good , but in the end , someone have a lapse , I don't now if a editor or director, but ....I try to tell , my friends is the movie goes great and 5 min to the end of the movie the guys goes bananas and crap the movie.It's a horrible fault make this mistake, great movie that going down in the end, incredible!"
4,Good movie,"I heard a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but I do not think it was terrible. It was entertaining, parts were frightening, parts were disturbing, and it wasn't one of those movies I felt like wasted my time after watching it. I had regretfully read the wiki article on this movie before watching it, so I knew roughly what was going to happen before it did. It would have been a much more entertaining movie if I was watching it knowing no background on the movie or its plot. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies, but I wouldn't build it up too much. Take it for what it is, entertainment!"
5,So much better than expected,"I love it when I watch these movies that I sort of want to see but I wouldn't pay to see them at the theater, and they blow me off my feet. This movie was awesome! I loved it! Man, I highly reccommend this one!"
2,A little slow,"I am not a mystery reader, but saw this one and decided to try it. I see that this author has written numerous books, so perhaps I just picked the wrong book. The premise of the book was not very original - let's get all the murder suspects in one place - and find out the murderer's identity and I found it hard to believe that most of these characters were in their 20's and 30's. They all spoke as if they were characters in an Audrey Hepburn movie. I don't know anyone in that age range who would tell someone else that they were ""swell"" or use the adjectives ""glorious"" and ""lovely"". There was not much character development, even with the husband and wife who were the main characters and they never seemed real to me. The book was too slow and I never finished reading it or cared enough to find out who killed Jeremiah."
3,Resort Isle of No Return,"Carolyn Hart's DEATH OF THE PARTY has Anne and Max Darling invited to investigate a murder that occurred a year before. All the people who were present at the time of the crime have been invited to ""help"" solve the crime.A plantation house on a private island that has been turned into a B&B; is the scene of the mystery. No one can leave the island or communicate with the mainland until the crime is solved.A new twist on Agatha Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. The story with Anne and a new persona Max on the hunt is a fun read for fans of the series.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
1,Party's Over,"My first by this author and the last. I can't believe she has written and sold so many. Very amateurish. The Darlings showed no wisdom at all. There were enough holes in the story for an elephant to pass through. Everyone ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. Probably the only surprise in the whole weekend was the stranding of all the participants by the handy man. I don't think Britt planned that one.Everyone was left stranded on the dock by the author who then jumped to the bookstore a month later.Better luck next time Darlings, but I won't be following your blundering."
4,Decent product at a good price,"The price was reasonable and the flasher it's self is decent. The elastic arm band is a bit cheap(ish), but does the job fine. I'm quite sure I would have paid much more at a running store for a very similar product."
2,Sent wrong item.,I ordered this item but received an alternative. What I ordered used 2 AAA batteries & weighed 1.12 ounces. What I received uses 2 AA batteries & weighs 2.5 oz.
1,"Nicely bright, but VERY cheap construction.","These are extremely flimsy. We bought four of them, (good to be safe right?), and all but one have broken apart. Ride over a little bump, they break off. Ride over a slight ridge in the pavement, they break off. And of course, ride off a curb and they will break off. The plastic is just so cheap that it can't support its own weight and the weight of the batteries inside. EXTREMELY lousy construction. Avoid unless you are going to use them on something that doesn't move, a flag-pole or something. Even then the case might still break when you put the batteries inside. The lights ARE bright though....I gotta say something good!We bought replacements at Meijers in Ohio ($7.99) and they are a great replacement. Sorry I don't have product details for the suggested replacement."
3,"Not Ideal for Runners, but very bright!","Light is super bright, but does not clip well onto clothes for running. I assume these lights would work very well with the included bike clip, but they slip off of clothes very easily. Also, they DID NOT come with the Velcro strap shown in the picture, just the light and the bike clip. They work OK for my night runs, but If i had to do it again, I would purchase a different light that had a better clip on the back."
1,Don't buy this!,"As of 1 August 2006, Universal Remote Control will no longer allow consumers to download the software needed to program this remote. You might as well flush your money down the toilet. Pronto - here I come."
1,I Would Not Buy This Remote Even Though It Works Great,"I purchased this remote in early 2006 and it is a wonderful remote. I cannot imagine a better universal remote. You download device information from a website for most popular devices. These are easily configurable. Too bad you can no longer do this.....However, as others have mentioned, unless you purchase this from an authorized dealer, the remote is more or less useless. This new policy from URC is as of August 1, 2006.Although I love this remote, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for a remote from a friendlier company than URC - or make sure the remote dealer is authorized by URC AND stays authorized since you need to go to your dealer for all future software device updates. So, if the dealer is no longer authorized at the time in the future when you buy a new TV or DVD player and you wish to use this remote to control it, you are out of luck."
2,No Longer Useful,"URC has removed support for this product from it's website. When I bought it, they supported home users who could program their own devices. Now they only want to sell thru dealers who provide the programming service."
2,Not for Building Websites,"Don't buy this book if you are planning to make something useful for a Web Site. It just does not help. I bougth it and now I'm using on-line guides to JavaScript to find the syntax of the functions I need, specially to learn how to get the values from Web Forms."
3,Good reference book for JavaScript,"This book is a good reference book for thelanguage (our university used it as a textbook), but it is a little dated now. Dynamic HTML canbe powered by JavaScript, and you can createsome neat effects..... none of this will be foundin this edition."
2,Leaves very much to be desired,"This book seems to provide a fairly good explanation of different elements of Javascript. However, I bought a Javascrpit book with the intention of actually learning how to use Javascript to do something on a web site. This book has been no help at all. Instead of covering Javascript from cover to cover, it strays to JAVA, VBScript, etc.. As with other QUE books I've purchased, it wasn't much help at all"
1,Horrible reference.,This book's coverage of JavaScript is spotty at best. Not even close to being worth the trees it took to print this thing.
1,lack of clarity,"I have a feeling if I was able to sit down and talk with Graham, I might agree with him more than I think. Unfortunately this book is one of the most poorly written and badly edited pieces of literature that I've seen in a long time. I found a lot of things that are so generically obvious that they shouldn't have taken up the entire chapters that were used to state them, several things that I might agree with if I could get through the lingo-laden, spiritual sales talk enough to understand what he meant, many things that just didn't make since at all not to mention complete contradictions of prior statements within the book, and some things that are outright questionable. He might have some good points in his personal vision, but unfortunately this book is such a mess that none of them are communicated."
5,sensational,Anything that Graham Cooke writes is a blessing. He has a real glimpse into the heart of God and I love the affirmation throughout. His website has wonderful product to sample
1,Whatever is compelling you to buy it don't!,"This guitar sounds terrible. there is nothing you can do to make it sound better. This guitar is unplayable,it is so off balance it rolls forward in your hands. My little grand kids won't even play it. Also don't bother contacting Martin when the neck warps you won't hear back. Whatever is compelling you to buy it don't!"
3,Wheels wear out,We have an Evenflo stroller for our young child. The plastic rear wheels wore out after a year of use. We are heavy users but replacing only the rear wheels is difficult since Evenflo's web page requires the model number and manufacture date - these are not located on the stroller where they are suppose to be: there is no date and the model number is too long to fit in the Evenflo box for it. It's ridiculous to replace the entire stroller just because the plastic rear wheels are worn out.
2,Alarm Remotes,"The alarm functions works well with this item, but I ordered a new one from Amazon just to get two new remotes. The remotes tend to break at the loop for the key chain, and the entire alarm is less expensive then the two remote controls would cost to replace. I broke both of the originals in about 3 years and I don't see any change in the design so I suspect these will last about the same. 1-2 years each."
3,"Good story, bland art","I thought the premise of this book was quite interesting, and although it was too short to really develop the characters to their fullest, they ended up being quite interesting and sympathetic. I liked the idea of setting the action underwater as well. The only problem for me was that I didn't like the art. I had been under the impression that the cover art was indicative of the quality of the inside art, but aside from a few pictures done by the cover artist the style is very sketchy, which is alright by itself, but the characters are very indistinct and it's often very hard to tell what's supposed to be happening. Weird transitions and vaguely defined figures make the action rather confusing a lot of the time. I wish it had been refined more before publishing."
2,Predator in Hot Water=Boorrinng,"I first read this in the Predator Omnibus volume 3, and at first it does sound pretty good. But, in the end, it's no good. There is only one good scene where the Predator tricks everyone and the people realize they were just bait for bigger, better game... In the end the art is terrible,(it looks like it was drawn with only colored pencils) the story is boring, (it lags in waaay to many places), and it lacks the terror of other Predator comics. It is one of Dark Horses 3 issue limited series, not the usual 4 issues, and the story still moves along with the pace of a snail. Basically, it's only worth a. checking out from the library, b. buying it used, or c. just reading it in the Predator Omnibus volume 3, where you other Predator comics that are waaaay better worth the money. Not really reccomended, only for hard-core fans. 2 stars, or a grade C-. (only because it still is, after all, a Predator comic.)"
2,Pain in the neck,"It's about 1 cm too short. You can just barely zip a U.S. passport inside, by stretching the fabric and bending the passport. Also, perspiration condensed inside the plastic window. After 17 days in Europe, my passport got so bent up that it took about a dozen swipes of the scanner before Customs could read it."
3,Too Small,I did not pay enough attention to dimensions and had to buy a different wallet that fits my sons passport. Item descriptions are getting really difficult to find on amazon
4,nice on ice,Pleasant summer drink iced down. It is guzzled at our barbecues and goes well with just about any type of food.
5,I love this book!,"This is the cutest book I've read in a long time, and my daughter loves it. Its the story of a Co-Sleeping family and the daddy's quest for more room to sleep. He builds the biggest bed in the world, and when that doesn't work out, he builds individual beds for all of the children in another room - only to find out he can't sleep without them because he's lonely!This book captures the joys and tribulations of co-sleeping families perfectly. We all sometimes wake up with a foot in our face and think ""why are we doing this?"" - but waking up all snuggled up with our children is one of life's sweetest moments. This book captures it in a funny, delightful, and heartwarming way!"
3,"Pretty good, but not fabulous","It may be that my daughter is still too young to really appreciate this book. She likes it, but it is not one of her faves. It is very sweet and is one of the few books available for children who share the family bed."
4,A sweet and fun story for family-bedders.,"I suspect this book accurately reflects the mixed feelings many parents have about sharing their beds with their children. Sweet and good for a laugh, for both parents and kids."
5,Great indie work by future stars!!,This film although a first for the young director is a very gripping tale of suspense and thrills. Anyone who likes a good drama will thoroughly enjoy this film. Keep a look out for ShaunPaul Costello and crew they are going to be big stars before you know it!!
3,"French II, Barron's","99 per cent of the material is NOT translated, so this means you have to do a lot of work to understand the material. With no verb conjugation material, it is very difficult to translate. I bought the Oxford French-English dictionary at about $50 so I could look up the conjugated verb to translate the sentence. Very poor of the authors to not translate at least 50 per cent of the material. You will spend hundreds of hours translating the material. Unless you want to spend that much time, I would not recommend buying it."
5,A neater version of the classic poem,"This is one interesting version of the classic poem, ""Old Mother Hubbard."" One interesting detail for the verse, ""But when she came back the poor dog was dead"" is that the picture shows that the dog wrote a note saying he couldn't live without a bone. An interesting comment on the picture for the undertaker verse is that the coffin is shown wrapped up like a present. In fact, it looks to me like a gift box of chocolates. James Marshall has extended the classic poem to include his own verses(well, it is an easy poem for which to make up your own verses)."
4,silly silliness,"I'm not sure the original had as many verses as this- but the number makes for a good bout of goofiness and lots of fun illustrations.We start out with the bare cupboards- bare because the mice had dined in the pantry, complete with a waiter, and the dead dog. Poor Mother Hubbard tries to do right by her dog by immediately dressing in black and buying a coffin, but the darned dog had tricked her and wasn't dead after all! phew! Instead, Mother Hubbard goes shopping everywhere for her dear dog- to the barber, the the tailor, the cobbler, the fruit stand, the tavern- but always, when she returns home, the dog is doing something else and doesn't need coffin, the coat, the shoes, the fruit, the wine. But we do get to see the silliness of the various shop owners and Mother Hubbard in an amazing amount of finery including a fantastic cowgirl outfit all ""little old ladies"" should consider wearing. At least now and then."
2,I picked this up too late,"This is a classic piece of Simpsons heritage. The early 1990's ushered in a slew of t-shirts, books, games, and toys with our favorite TV family plastered all over. The problem is, nobody ever worried ""is this a good representation of the show?"". This book includes all kinds of cute stories, lists, and pictures from the point of view of Bart Simpson. I found a copy at a book sale, and it was fun, but the humor is very dated for the times and the show. I would have gone crazy over this in my childhood, but this is not for younger viewers."
5,Great book,"I bought this for nostalgia reasons; it reminded me of pouring over this book with my friends back in elementary school. Pick this up for your kid, or for yourself."
5,Hilarious Read,Bart Simpson's Guide to Life is undoubtadly one of the best books to be based on The Simpsons that I have read.The laughs keep on coming all the way through to the last page thanks to Matt Groening's pointed wit and satirical look at modern life.A must for every Simpsons fan.
5,A great book,Bart Simpson's Guide to Life is great. It gives funny descriptions to life and how things work.
5,"very,very,funny just read my review","ok first of all i really thought this book was great because bart simpson (really Matt Groening)hits every subject school,parents,physcology,arts and culture.very funny on every subject too.i would probaly give this a rating of 4.5-5.0 because of how he hits religion which is pretty discgraceful but i have and always will be the biggest simpsons fan so it is a great book and realtes to all the comics and shows.i brought this book into school and with a block class of 31 people about 25 asked to look at it and after that asked to borrow it i showed it to my teacher and she started laughing when i should her school.but anyways simpson fan or not a great book to buy."
5,Excellent Book,What is the meaning of life anyway? Get this book and follow bart around the pages to find out.
5,funny & entertaining,bart simpsons guide to life is a book that keeps you entertained and gets more funny everytime you read it. It is worth every penny
4,One of the best Simpsons books in print!!!!!,"I thought this was a great book. I am 10 years old. I read the book, and am now Bart Simpson. Though I thought there could have been more subjects like Sports, or Weekends, but other than those minor subjects, a must have book. GREAT!!!!!"
2,The ook was nothing about the simpsons. but it had some ok .,The book was nothing about the Simpsons. It was okay but defiantley not 5 stars.
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN! I MEAN IT!,"This is the best book you will ever read! Belive me. I would NEVER lie to a fellow Simpsons merchindise shopper. Buy it Buy it Buy it! A must have for the TRUE Simpson's fan. I read the whole thing the first day I got it. This is NOT the kind of book that gets boring after a few pages. This is the book you will want to read over a million times. But, you must have watched the show MANY times to understand what it is all about. Other than that this is a book for everyone. Oh yah,and those""I hate the Simpsons and Bart is so immature and I'm going to read this so I can critizize it"" kinda people shouldn't read it.I know there out there by reading some of those ""other"" reviews. I think Bart is a true jenius! BART ROCKS,MAN! Of course everyone already knows that!"
1,"Ummm Bart, I Just Don't Get It!","A book ""written"" by the world's most overexposed cartoon character. Loses a lot in book form as opposed to the TV show. Save your money for the episode guide, which is a lot more interesting."
5,#1,Frances Vaughan is the best in the series with Charles Tart a close second and Christina Grof a distant third. The rest of the series I could have done without.
4,Good Dictionary for K-3,"One of my kids favorite dictionaries when they were younger. They liked the phonetic pronunciations that were provided (parachute as pa-ruh-shoot; reservation as rez-ur-vay-shuhn), and the sample sentences which followed most of the definitions. For various spelling programs, the kids had to write sentences using their spelling words, and, while they certainly didn't copy verbatim, the sample sentences definitely aided in comprehension. Now that they are older (5th and 6th), most of the words they look up aren't in this dictionary."
3,Just ok,I bought this book along with the children's encyclopedia for my seven year old daughter and a few of the words that we were looking for weren't present in this dictionary.
5,The best political movie I've ever seen,"""Lesser of two evils"" is the only way to describe this race, and this movie does a great job of showing that. I was living in Fredericksburg, VA in 1994, and the Robb-North fight was fascinating to watch. Virginia deserved better, but at least we don't have the shame of sending Ollie to the Senate."
3,Good but troubling POV,A Perfect Candidate is an interesting and thought provoking documentary on the Senate race between Republican Oliver North (of Iran Contra fame) and scandal tarred incumbent Deomcrat Chuck Robb.The movie tries to make the case that no matter what your positions are on the issues it is better to vote for someone who is a idealogue than a moderate. It demeans the very notion of someone who may be conservative on some issues and liberal on others. Before that it is a celebration of Oliver North because of his perfect conservatism. When North starts to make mistakes and Robb starts tearing into him the movie becomes more interesting because the filmmakers obviously never thought Robb could win re-election.The great thing about this documentary is all of the scenes with Douglas Wilder. He was the first black governor of Virginia and ran as an independant in the Senate race for a while. The racial issues explored is the main reason why this is worth getting.
2,You need to know the back story...,"This film sounded interesting but my training as a historian prompted me to investigate the authors of the film. Cutler and Taylor have made careers out of agenda driven reality shows. Left-wing agendas... It doesn't matter that the topic was Oliver North, George Bush, or the so-called religious right the mission was to impugn the reputation of those being filmed. This was different when Cutler made his famous ""The War Room"" and the new war room movie. The left was made to look to look competent and honorable though now we know some of the cheats pulled by the 1992 Clinton campaign. They never appeared or were hinted at by Cutler. So watch this movies with your eyes wide open and your skeptic program running full speed."
4,Pretty Good Documentary,I actually thought A Perfect Candidate was pretty good. I've been a huge fan of Oliver North since 1994 when he ran for U.S. Senate. I recommend A Perfect Candidate to anyone on the right or the left who is interested in politics.
2,Dissapointed,Not what I expected. I only like 2 songs on the whole disk. I'm gonna try to give it to my son. Maybe he'll enjoy it from a younger prospective. No reflection on the shopping experience. Quick delivery and service. Wish I could exchange it for another CD though.
3,"Great production, Needs more original material","I thought this CD was alright. But for a double CD I wish it had more studio cuts on it (it's mostly a live recording). Still, the recording quality is great and they did a good job of capturing the audience reactions. Sounds like they were screaming like crazy. It would probably make a good DVD.In the middle of the recording, he talks about how he believes that you're not saved if you don't show evidence by speaking in toungues. That threw me but I guess that's just the belief of the Apostolic denomination he belongs to.Can't hate though, dude can sing phenomenally. His range is incredible. His creativity seems equally awesome. He made a song using the theme song of Family Feud - how original.Still, this CD won't really get any more spins in my CD player (except for maybe one track - the live version of Taxi, that's off the hook). I'm more into his previous material."
2,If you can't give God the Glory.. then stay home and sing to the mirror,"What was this brotha thinking? Except for a couple passable ""worship"" ballads on disc two, this CD is a good frisbee for tossing out the window while driving down the highway at incredible speeds. I respect everyone trying to duplicate Kirk's ""Stomp"" but hey man, keep it inside the box if it don't make no sense, and can't reach the soul of the individual. Surely glad i didn't pay big money to see this live recording. Cause' i sure know I would've spoken in tongues all the way to the refund counter."
5,THE BOY IS OFF THE HINGES.,"IF YOU NEVER KNOW THE PERSON YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THE MAN.THIS IS THE BEST CD MAY BE OF ALL TIME I KNOW THIS YEAR.TONEX IS A MAN OF GOD I JUST LIKE TO SAY KEEP SETTING THE EXAMPLE YOU SET FOR YOUNG PEOPLE EVERYWHERE ALL SONGS ON THIS CD IS TIGHT BECAUSE HE KEEPS IT REAL MOST GOSPEL ARTIST ARE CAPTURED IN TRYING TO COMPETE WITH THE OTHER GOSPEL ARTIST ITS NOT ABOUT THAT TBOY IS KEEPING IT REAL AS FOR AS THE SONGS MY FAVORITES ARE SYNG THANK Q,ALIVE, MAN I CANT NAME EVERYONE THE WHOLE CD,JUST GET IT AND TONEX I LIKE YOUR STYLE THE SUIT IS OFF THE HINGES ANY TIME YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM AWAY EMAIL ME AT MICHAELGIBBS@FIRSTCOMMERCIALBANK.COM.,OAK PARK IS OFF THE CHAIN THIS IS THE YEAR OF THE APOSTOLICS GOD IS IN THE MIST OF EVERYONE HEARING THE TRUTH ACTS-2.38 FO LIFE."
4,A new Level of Anointing,"All I will say is the old and the new level of anointing is GOD's doing. Make me over again ""says it all"". God has done some marvelous things in Tonexs' life and now he can sing his Testimony. Continue to let God do it."
5,Amazing and annointed,"I loved this cd from the forst time I heard it. I wasn't really into tonex until I heard this cd and that made me get all his other albums. The brotha can sang! And not only that, he is an annointed preacher and artist who uses differsnt types of music to minister to people of all ages and races. Now, I ain't gon lie, this cd is very unique - truly out the box! But in a good way. Don't expect traditional gospel, but classic Tonex. My favorite songs are - Work on me, Games, Alive, The Childrens Bread and Taxi"
5,I truly thank god for hearing this cd,I think this cd was the best because the songs ministerd to you and expressed how Tonex really loves God. Also it really got me my mom and dad in true worship. And I really loved both cds because the beats were differrent than I heard before and I thought that was very good.The Lyrics were awesome. And i pray that he keeps on making cds like that and i hope that God continues to richly bless him and his wife as they go through life.
2,Too far out the box,"I didn't really care for disc #1. Way too much background noise with the cheers. Yes, I know, the CD says they're real, but I couldn't get into the songs. The words are what stir the soul. And the re-mix of the older songs was too much. Disc. #2 was ok."
1,Tonex - Out the Box,"This cd was a total disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If I could I would truly try to give it away in hopes that I wouldn't lose a friend by giving it to them. So to ensure this won't happen, I will just cut my loses and put it in my graveyard cd pile and give it a decent burial. I don't know what happened but I was thoroughly dissappointed in this project. It was neither inspirational or uplifting in my opinion."
1,very disappointed,"3 songs out of the double cd that are worth listening to. I'm going to give it away, it's to radical, yokes wont be destroyed, people are going to be confused. It doesn't bless your spirit. We need something to bring us back to God, with all these people killing babies, and killing each other we need good news and God music."
5,Closed Minded People,"People who are quick to judge need not buy this album. People who feel that the only real gospel music is quartet music and traditional choirs need not buy this album. People who hate hip hop beats need not buy this album.This album is amazing. Tonex recognizes that young people like me cannot get with all of that foot stompin, tambourine gospel music. I love God, and he understands that I like nice music. I like to listen to music with beats and messages.I especially loved ""Todos Juntos"", ""Make Me Over"", and the song with Kirk Franklin. This is an awesome album."
3,A little something of everything,"When I first heard of Tonex, I thought he was ""out there"" for real. ""Out the Box"" confirms my thoughts but he has certainly calmed down a lot from when he first came out. There are a few songs on the CD that I like, but still, it's a little crazy for me. I like having fun with gospel music and I don't think it has to be traditional, but some of the music is just way out there. Overall, it's a decent CD. I play it when I want to rock out in my car. I can pretty much listen to the first CD all the way through until after ""Children's Bread"" (or whatever it's called). Then I like ""To Know You Lord"". That's my jam! On CD number two I love, ""Make Me Over"" and ""I'm a Believer"". I can also listen to ""Since Jesus Came"". Good songs to get radical for Christ!"
4,Mixed feelings...,"I love Tonex, i remember him as Anthony Williams from Truth. Came a mighty long way and he's talented. Sometimes i got mixed messages, you could play the CD and be in worship and then get blasted by a heavy rock laced track. I guess he's trying to show you different folds. His range is tight, i think he's actually more versatile than his wife Yvette. For the most part he gets much love. A little something for everybody. Plus, I actually got to be at recording when i came into town. All that in one night for FREE. It was great."
3,Can't feel the Box,I like Tonex. But i just could not feel this one. Had some great songs that why I give it 3 stars.
1,you mean out the closet,tonnex needs to quit gospel and turn into the heathen sodomite he really is. looks like all you have to do to suceed in gospel now is use some techno hip hop beats and say you love jesus and talk a lot of crap about the bible sorry anybody wanna find salvation or a paradise listening to these hip hop gospel christian headbanging satan worshippers go ahead and you wonder why you're all confused your precious jehovah or christ or whoever you serve is against tonnex's lifestyle.
2,"It's ""Okay""","Personally, I was expecting more from Tonex in this CD . I thought he would have more songs like ""Make Me Over Again"" on it. Out of the 2 CD's, there are only a handful of songs that I actually liked. I mean, if you like moving your hips and/or headbanging...then buy this CD. You will love it! I was just expecting more ""traditional"", soul stirring songs from him, that's all."
2,Disappointment,I was very disappointed in this CD. I gave it 2 stars because I only liked two songs out of the whole double disc CD. The first disc was rock/dance and the other was praise/dance but they sounded absolutely the same--NO CHANGE. I just don't know what happened and that's the absolute truth. So if you're thinking about getting this CD instead of another one you want...DON'T!
3,A good book that just missed,"Anyone who has read Ray Charles own book, ""Brother Roy"", may find some of the blanks filled in with this biography.In general, the book is well-written with lots of interesting sidebars. It is rather disappointing, however, for the author to continuously refer to Charles' frugality and military attitude with his employees.As one of the first inductees in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it would have been interesting to hear from those he influenced and why. Not one of the best biographies I have read..but, then again...not one of the worst. If you like Ray Charles, you will find this interesting, but not overwhelminly informative."
5,Awesome - again!,"Just when I thought I knew what all of my favorite songs by Alison were, I bought Too Late to Cry, one of her earlier works. Foolish Heart, In Your Eyes and Don't Follow Me are now on my long list of AK and AKUS favorites. This enormously talented singer musician has done it again. Just buy all her music; you can't miss."
4,How to improve when you have hit a plateau for years!,"If you have been playing chess for years and seem to have stopped improving for awhile then ""Chess for Zebras"" may be for you. Sometimes you have a set way of thinking and even with good books on games with analysis, tactics, chess traps and more you don't improve. Well, these may be great books (certainly I recommend all of them), but you may need to add to your collection a book that gives a a ""different point of view"". That is ""Chess for Zebras"". Okay, some of the ideas may be a little questionable, but you need to do what works for you! And, as with any book, you don't need to take everything as gospil. Use your own mind, and decide for yourself!"
5,Fun Rhyming Book!,"This is a fun book that describes, in rhyme, the adventures of a colorful hat (mauve with orange and yellow feathers and a brown band). After the wind blows this hat off its wearer all the way to a hay field, it is occupied by a spider and then a mouse, it's used as a basket and almost as a nest, and a puppy takes it on a romp. Eventually, the original owner finds it.This is a simple story told well, with imaginative rhymes and great sound effects:""Tut! Tut!"" clucked the farmer's wife when she sawthe crow in the hat with a nest out of straw.""SHOO! SHOO!fly away!"" the farmer's wife said.Then off she skipped with the hat on her head.The pictures, which look like pastes pieces of brightly colored papers are child-like and playful. This is illustrator Holly Meade's first book, and her work sweetly compliments the writing of the accomplished Nancy Van Laan. An excellent book for the infant/toddler set!"
2,Meant More For Kids,"I recently bought this book and was disappointed to realize it was intended more for kids than adults. It has the facts but the writing isn't very great. There is no emotion in this book unless you search for it, the way it's written is more like a chronological list of the events in Jim Carrey's life than a story about a man. It does tell the very basic story of Jim Carrey's struggle to achieve his dreams so if you're interested in Jim Carrey it's not all bad, but I think 'The Joker Is Wild' will be a much better biography than this. But hey, if you're buying this book for a kid, go for it. Jim Carrey's is a very inspirational story, a true rags-to-riches tale. Only his story is real.I gave it two stars because I'm still a huge Carrey fan, so if it had been a picture book I wouldn't be completely disatisfied."
1,phony return policy,"we ordered 18 chairs at a delivered price of $1,805.20. after looking a 3 we decided that we did not want them and asked the delivery man to take them back. instead he dumped them on our driveway and left. we called the company and the delivery company and asked them to take the chairs back in accordance with amazon's return policy. we were told that in order to do so we would incur a total delivery charge of $763.08 and be charged a restocking fee of 25%. after many frustrating phone calls, we have decided to give the chairs to a local charity and never to buy anything but books from amazon."
2,OK But returned the item,Not happy with the restocking fee after I found the same item SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. Be cautious when you you buy this item online
2,"good guitar solo's, doesn't go well with vocals","This sounds like the remake of an old eighties song. The song goes better with the eighties style. Not with the punk style that reel big fish brings to it. However, they do have a good guitar. It's the vocals that bring a bad sound to a good song."
4,Civil assignment,"Deborah Ellis is a weaver of tales. This book gets a person inside the head of a 13-year-old girl striving to survive the Taliban. In her journey, she gains a new family after she had lost her own due to the war. After reading this book, you get a better understanding of what children who live in war torn countries have to undergo in order to survive. At times Parvana wonders if she will ever get out of the cycle of death and war. ""For a moment she wondered what she was becoming. Then she dismissed the question. `I didn't create this world,' she said to herself. `I only have to live in it.'""(128) The ending is very surprising. This book will move you to want to do something for the millions of displaced children in the world."

4,parvana's journey,It all started one day when parvana's dad died .Some people told parvana you could live with us.So she went. After a few days she left . She found a baby in a house. She called him Hassen.After she found a boy. His name was Asif. After she met a girl named leila.she has a grandmother.But she died.Asif does not like parvana.Hassen always cries.Leila even cries because she misses her grandmother. This book is a very good book.I really liked this book because it has a lot of tragic parts in it with some funny moments. I really liked the adventure and the stuff that the children went through. I was especially interested that the setting was Afghanistan.I liked it also because the cover looks cool.And i like it because it is telling about my country.
5,Parvana s journey,This is absolutely necessary for a kindle library collection and is the bomb of the reading world please read this book
3,"Entertaining, but leaves a lot to the imagination","PLum & Jaggers is the story of four children left as orphans when their parents are tragically killed in a train explosion in Italy. They go on to live with their elderly grandparents, and experience among them juvenile deliquency, a stalker, and in the case of one, and all consuming fear of terrorism and bombing. Sounds like the makings of a comedy troupe, doesn't it? But that's exactly what the four McWilliams children do. While the book is entertaining, it leaves many qestions unanswered. Why are the comedy sketches so funny? There are small hints about the set up, but no pieces of dialogue. And the scenes they set don't sound all that funny. I wanted to know who the stalker was. Was it Sam McWilliams arch nemesis from childhood? Or was it an admirer of Julia? Plum & Jaggers is an interesting examination of what happens to children when they are exposed to tragedy at such a young age, but it left a lot to be desired."
4,Compelling read about the aftermath of terror,"Susan Shreve has written a compelling, page turner of a book about the aftermath for children of terrorism. Remarkably, the book is sweet and decent. Part of its charm is the humaneness of its characters; there's a basic gentleness to them. The story is lively, suspenseful, moving and funny; and at the same time, it rings true about the effects of sudden parental loss on children, the ways it torques and warps the children's lives.Shreve's style is clean and restrained. The book is understated and well-written. A great summer read."
2,Mediocre book,"I found this book to be fairly readable, yet quite dull. In one word, this is a mediocre book. The characters in this book are flat. There are 2 brothers and 2 sisters, orphaned at a young age when their parents are killed in a terrorist bombing. As adults, they form a comedy troupe led by the oldest boy, Sam. Obviously, since the brothers and sisters are actors, you would expect some examples of their work incorporated into this book. However, there are no examples. You really have to guess what their performances are like, since the book is centered around them. This leaves no entertainment value to the book. You are, in effect, left wondering who these characters really are, and what they are really all about.I give this book 2 stars since it was not a terrible book. I simply think the author leaves you wondering what in tarnation was the point of this book having actors as main characters when they are dull and give you no indication that they can really act."
5,jigme rocks,I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes traditional music. Jigme Drukpa is an extremely gifted artist who displays his talents with a beautiful voice and a wonderful instrumental accompaniment. His work depicts Bhutan in its true character-an endless melody of tranquility and peace.Tashi Delek to Jigme Drukpa!
5,If you love sushi.......,You will love this book. If you are a vegetarian and love sushi then this book will send you straight to sushi heaven! Great pictures and easy to understand. You will be on your way to creating beautiful tasty sushi in no time at all.
5,Hell's Kitchen unleashed!,"The Hell's Kitchen series has been around since 2005 and by now most folks have heard of it. In 2011 it has garnered some impressive ratings but with all of the bleeping it's as if 20% of the dialogue is obliterated. If one is prone to like the style of the show, then viewing the ""Raw and Uncensored"" version truly puts the reality back into this program. Chef Ramsay's frequent and creative use of expletives is left in-tact and the emotions of the contestants are expressed in their own uncensored words. It makes a big difference!"
4,"Great Show, Werid DVD.",I Love Hell's Kitchen And Hereing Him Curse Here And All Of The Other Guys Was freaking Sweet! ^^The Good:The Extras were Good And The UNCENSORING On the Epsiodes Was AWESOME.The Bad: Poorly Desgined Meuns You Can Click On The Epsiode Before The Words Load! And During On One Of The Epsiodes The TV-14 Rating Box Appeared Like I Was Watching It On TV! WTF? It Happened On One Of The Epsiodes On Disc 2.Like I Said I Love Hell's Kitchen But This DVD Was Werid But WHATEVER!
5,great dvd!,I love chef Ramsey's show to see him mend good cooks into leaders at the end of the show!its exciting!
2,Not As Advertised,"The track listing is for the CD I wanted to buy, but it isn't the CD I received. The CD I received is from Holland made in 2000. Some of the songs listed are included, but some aren't - like Geisha Boys and Temple Girls & Who'll Stop The Rain, which makes it very disappointing for me. The additional 7 songs don't make up for the lack of my favorites. The track listing should read:1. Temptation2. Come Live With Me3. Sunset Now4. This Is Mine5. (We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang6. I'm Your Money7. Height of the Fighting (He-La-Hu)8. Play to Win9. Let Me Go10. Penthouse and Pavement11. Trouble12. Crushed by the Wheels of Industry13. Flame Down14. Contenders15. We Live So Fast16. The Ballad Of Go-Go BrownIf you - like me - are trying to replace your vinyl copy of the album with the listed tracks, this is not the answer."
3,Brings back memories...,"Most people probably don't know much about Mike Stand. But the heart, honesty and raw energy generated by Mike and his band, the Altar Boys, were rarely matched in their genre - Christian music - or any other.This disc is a combination of Mike's solo work. I still have Simple Expression, but someone borrowed Do I Stand Alone? and never gave it back. It contains some great heartland guitar rock, kind of like the BoDeans or maybe Bruce Springsteen.""I'm Only Human"" starts off the disc, and probably deservedly so. If any of Mike's songs personifies him, it's probably this song. But what kind of bothers me is that whoever put together this album decided to slightly rearrange the order of the songs, instead of leaving in its original form. What's more, a song the Simple Expression album, ""Fade Into You"", is ommited entirely.But outside those quirks, this album is a keeper for me and a relief that I can actually find these songs."
1,No Performances by U2 !!!,"From the description, we thought this DVD included U2 PERFORMING the songs from the Achtung Baby CD, plus commentary, but there were no U2 PERFORMANCES; only pundits TALKING about U2 !!!"
3,DVD quality fantastic - film is a revelation,"I originally saw this giallo about 5 years ago in a terrible censored and pan and scanned video. Thought the film was awful. The quality of this DVD is magnificent and greatly improves the film - it can now be seen in all its original stylish, suspenseful and misogynistic glory. The ski-masked, knife wielding killer must have inspired the Halloween series. Director Sergio Martino's use of colour is awesome in the two early murder scenes. The last half hour, with Suzy Kendall alone in the house with the killer (not having taken her clothes off, she is the only woman allowed to survive), having to watch her friends being dismembered is really tense and exciting."
2,Lacklustre giallo,"I was disappointed with this film. Having recently seen Martino's other giallo's, this easily ranks as his worst effort. But if you love giallo's (like me) there's some to enjoy here. The music score is good, the photography excellent (and the picture quality of this disc allows you to enjoy it's scenery to the fullest) and it's got some decent kills.However it's nearly completely devoid of any real suspense. It's brutal subject matter is handled rather clumsily, it drags incredibly; for a very long time absolutely nothing happens. Granted, it does have a bit of tension in it's final third, but just think what, say, Dario Argento could have pulled off with a finale like that.This was Martino's last giallo. I personally think he was getting bored with the genre. This movie seems to have been rushed and not made with any real passion. A shame, it had great potential"
2,boring and not scary at all,"I have ordered a bunch of horror movies, and this is the only one I regret. The story is mundane, there's little suspense involved and the murders are so obviously faked it made me laugh. For instance, the killer grabs girls by the throat, and four seconds later they're dead! Also, the models of the victims' bodies or heads used are obviously faked too (I think they were stolen from a wax statue museum!). There are some beautiful women and nudity but nothing to write home about. You want to know what I prefered in the movie? Some exterior scenery and the musical theme, which is very cute! So, borrow that movie if you want but don't buy it."
1,There is a line between kitch and total cheese. This film crossed it.,It opens with a semi pornographic threesome which is pointless to the movie. I know these films always have gratuitous boobs and ass but this went too far for the sake of a weak plot at best. The acting is HORRIBLE no mater how many times they attempt to cover it up with senseless nudity. The characters were trite and unbelievable. The plot was poorly developed. The quality was horrible and this is coming from a girl who loves the grainy integrity of actual film.
1,Boring waste of time,"I didn't like this film very much. It was boring and tedious to sit though. I used the fast-forward on parts of it, it was that bad. I love horror movies but this one was just a big dud in my books. Seems like the director wanted to concentrate more on the nudity and sex than on the actual story or murders. The effects were really bad. After watching Lucio Fulci dvds, this one was a big yawn. The only thing this movie taught me is how the people in Italy ride motorbikes with no helmets and how incredibly loose the women up there are.I felt like i was watching a 70s soft-core porno. The tag line of this movie on the trailer is: ""Torso! It saturates the screen with terror!"" My version would be, ""Torso! It saturates the screen with boredom."""
4,Great although must use EVERY day.,"This toothpaste seems to do what it promises, with some of my rough surfaced teeth feeling smoother after a month of using it. I will continue to use it and see what results I get, but so far, so good."
3,There are better JR books out there -,"These are the stories of 3 eligible bachelors/brothers and the women that finally 'catch' them. I enjoyed the stories since I live in LA but that was about it. JR's earlier books are great! These stories were silly at times for me and didn't really have anything to really sink your teeth into. They were just fun to read for an afternoon. Glad I didn't buy the book. Would I recommend it - if you just want something to read, yeah."
1,The book that bores everyones bones,"Whats bred in the Bone is one of the worst novels I have ever read in my life. The plot is boring -the main character (francis cornish) dies after an uneventful life. The book was made worse by the constant interruptions of two ""angles"" who make useless comments about Francis Cornish's life. This book should be rated R, for the constant referals to masterbastion and cross dressing."
5,One of the best novels ever written in any language.,"Davies always anchors his world in the primal instincts, the truths of human nature. You are never quite prepared for the surprising complexity of his characters or the fate that awaits them. The realistic evolution of Francis from troubled boyhood to artistic savant is really a modern version of David Copperfield, except the female characters are more fully dimensioned than Dickens could ever manage. And there is nothing of Dicken's stuffiness here. This is great literature with a Monty Python flair. No matter how you slice it a convincing argument can be made that during the last ten years of his life Davies was the greatest living novelist writing in English."
3,"great, love it!",This was exactly what I was looking for. My son is 3 years old and he loves Thomas The Tank Engine! I wanted to get him a lunch box for daycare that was much more than just a plastic box. A keepsake tin was perfect!
2,flimsy,"Our son is a Thomas the Tank Engine FANATIC. Therefore when we were looking for a lunchbox for him this was the logical choice. I realize that it is not advertised as a lunchbox per-se, but it sure looks like what the manufaturer was going for. I remember having metal luch boxes when I was a child and this is not of the same quality. Those lunch boxes were thrown, kicked and dropped and the structural integrity held up (although the images/paint would scratch off). My 3 YO son didn't even put it through the torture-test that I did with mine as a child. This lunch box is smaller, constructed of thinner tin, and after using it for a month, the latch broke."
2,Thomas Box,"Box is deep, but the one pictured was not the one I received. It ended up being deilvered on my sons birthday so I just gave him what was sent. Also, the ground shipping was very slow and done through the terrible SmartPost through FedEx. Had I known that I wouldnt have ordered."
4,My daughter enjoys it.,I don't feel this workbook does the best job of helping children understand sentence structure. The child work from the same picture for 3 days progressively building more of the sentence themselves each day. It is ok practice but if I used the whole book it would be quite redundant. This book is not a bad purchase but not quite what I was hoping for. What it does do is give more handwriting practice without actual copy work which is good.
3,Solo dibujar,"Este libro resulto muy aburrido para mi hijo, le parece mas bien un castigo seguir el procedimiento que se indica."
4,What A Birthday Present!,"My kids had heard me comment on hearing and appreciating this ""new grass"" sound. They also knew I hadn't bought myself a new CD in ages. So, as part of a birthday gift, they bought me ""Drive"" by Bela Fleck. Let me tell you....both my grandfathers and my dad were fairly accomplished players so I can appreciate good...WOW! This is teriffic stuff! I recommend it highly. I'm currently making a list of these ""new grass regulars"" and plan to patronize them all!"
2,Bela flecks DRIVE Lp,Sadly i got a hold of this record hoping it would be a bluegrass masterpiece. It is not. With the exception of a couple of tunes the majority of this record is devoted to celtic noodlings and faux Irish melodies. Not one of his best.
5,Listen at Your Own Risk,"My brother and I popped this CD into the deck of a rented truck as we headed from Jackson, WY, out toward the Wind River Range. About three tracks into it, we realized we were going nearly 90 miles an hour. Our recognition of this fact perfectly coincided with a state trooper's recognition of us. All we could tell the guy was that we were blasting some incredible bluegrass and that its hypnotic power sort of caught us off guard. Sorry, officer. The cop looked at us for a minute, smiled, and gave us a firm warning to slow it down, and strolled back to his cruiser. We exhaled in relief. Then, the cop spun around just as he was about to get into his car and yelled, ""I suggest you boys try some Perry Como!""""Drive"" is the tightest, most frenetic, river-water-rolling, sleekest, greatest frikkin' 'grass disc out there. Please listen responsibly."
5,Very Uplifting Modern Bluegrass,"Whoa, this guy is good. As a 5 string banjo player, I really appreciate this Fleck's unique talent and creativity. This is definitely not your grandfather's bluegrass music. Although the instruments are the same, the basic structure of the songs are altogether different from the old school. This is a must listen for any bluegrass lover and a must-buy for all banjo lovers. I particularly love the track ""See Rock City"". This CD dates from the mid 1980's but sounds really fresh and timeless. In my humble opinion, this is his best work, and it is awesome on all accounts."
5,Drive - a real bluegrass blast...,"This is surely the most awesome bluegrass album I have purchased to date - you can feel the wind in your hair while listening to ""Slipstream""..."
5,A Must Have,"This is one of the most outstanding books on the subject of Trafalgar, Nelson and the sailing navy I have come across. The small details are brought vividly to life in a way that makes interesting reading. The artwork in this book is specially commissioned for the book and is therefore technically accurate. This differs from other books on this subject that use art from around the time with foot notes explaining the technical inaccuracies in the pictures. The life of Nelson is covered in detail and is tied in with explaining life in the navy of the time interspersed with stories of individuals of various ranks and what their life was like. Personal stories, where available, are included to bring the whole picture to life. The artwork along with all the maps and diagrams is in full colour making everything easily understandable."
5,Angus: Why oh why are you not out on DVD???,"Angus was the perfect movie. A story told many times before of the outcasts and how they found their place. Here, it is helped along by the consumate acting of Kathy Bates and George C. Scott along with the younger actors spot on performances. There was something for everyone to relate to in this film and the ending was what everyone hopes for without seeming trite or connived. This movie bowled me over when I first saw it. I just wish some big exec would realize that it needs to be out on DVD!! Even if it doesn't - break out that old VHS player and see this movie. Angus Rocks!"
2,"Awesome Movie! October 10, 1999","This was an awesome movie because, especially being an overweight teenager myself, i can relate to angus in some ways. this movie was great and had good quotes! ""Screw em!"" ""Superman isn't brave, he's industructable!"" ""It's plum!"""
1,Angus,The tape skipped and stuck in the machine. It was very disappointing as I was showing it to a classroom full of tenth graders.
4,Just like high school...,I first saw this movie on TV and had to rent it. I could almost relate to Angus in certain parts of the movie. It kind of reminds you of that not so populare kid in your science class that hardly speeks and you see at lunch with only one or two friends. Or if that is a discription of what you're like you have to buy this.
5,-------,"When this movie came out, I was in fourth grade and I kind of related to Angus...I was way too tall for my age and I had passed the ideal weight for five foot six before I was even that tall. But having overweight people credited for being brave gave me the influence to go to school everyday and ""Laugh with them"" so they couldn't laugh at me."
2,a message for fat kids but this movie chews the fat and dies,"this movie sends a good message about geeks and popular kids and the tension between them all. but it sorta makes the movie downfall with all the comedy and the grossness of it all. Scott is funny as Angus' grandpa and it you dont know who that chess player he plays chess with its veteran director Irwin Kershner who directed The Empire Strikes Back. also not that there's a young James Van Der Beek(Varsity Blues, The Rules Of Attraction), Ariana Richards(Spaced Invaders, Jurassic Park) and Chris Owen(Cant Hardly Wait, October Sky, American Pie 1 and 2). fun all around but boring in sections. soundtrack includes Green Day"
1,Terrible--I had to speak up,"This movie was the cause of the worst date I ever went on as a teenager. ""Angus"" was disgusting and predictable. It played up to the worst in human nature. I searched this movie title just to see if I could trust the customer ratings at Amazon. Not that I blame Amazon--people usually rate the movies they like. My advice: avoid this film. Buy something else. Angus is a waste."
1,tHiS mOvIe BiTeZ!,"I recently watched the movie ""Angus"". I compared the movie to the story, I found out that some of the movie that I watched was changed around, like in the story Angus had parents who were separated, and they were gay. The movie, there was only his mother and his grandfather. Angus's grandfather dies on his wedding day. My opinion of the story and the movie, both of them were a waste of time."
5,Swee-eee-eet,"This has got to be the greatest movie of all time. Right up there with Cool Runnings, Back to the Future, Home Alone, and Office Space. This movie is a classic. For every person who ever had a crush on somebody. I would definately recommend this movie to anybody. P.S. And if you've always wanted to see James Vander Beek get pushed around and beat up, this is the movie for you."
4,Well made coming of age film.,"In his last year of High School, a overweight Teenage boy named Angus (Charlie Talbert) has win a date with a attractive Cheerleader (Ariana Richards), who he did had a Crush on. This unexpected thing in his life, will changed forever.Directed by Patrick Read Johnson (Baby`s Day Out) has made a film with full of Genuine Warmth. This film is an Impressive Supporting Cast including:Chris Owen, Oscar-Winner:George C. Scott, Oscar-Winner:Kathy Bates and James Van Der Beek. This film is a gentle rite of Passage. One of the Best Coming of Age Films for Teens ever made. Grade:A-."
4,realistic,"At first, I saw the end of the movie as I was flipping channels. But it came on the next day and I watched. It was so real I felt as if I understood Angus. It is a terrific movie for young teenagers going through Jr. High & High school. It's just really great, I can't think of how to put it!"
5,really good,"This movie was excellent. It didn't go the way of most stupid teen movies, and the ending ('final' ending, that is) was not predictable and was pretty refreshing. I felt like I knew those kids. Great soundtrack, too."
5,Awesome Movie!,"This movie was great for everyone and it never gets old! Especally being a big kid, I understood this movie and how Angus felt sometimes when he was humiliated. Watch this movie, believe me!"
4,Bobby Womack on Valium,"""Help me Understand You"" is beautiful. There are other high points. Overall, this Jimmy Lewis collection has the skunky feel of Memphis and Muscle Shoals, good songs, good playing by the band. Take Bobby Womack down a notch, mix it with Oscar Brown Jr., and you have Jimmy Lewis. Oh, and add a sufficient dose of Ketamine, alcohol and valium."
2,Very Disappointing,"My son earned a pirate ship for good behavior. It took him 6 months of hard work. I wanted to get him something worthy of his hard work and this SEEMED like it would be perfect. I have been so disappointed! It was difficult to assemble because the parts didn't align properly. The ship started breaking daily since we got it. The anchor went first, then all the flags. It didn't come with figures (I thankfully ordered those separately and they have held up beautifully! They were made by a different company.) I wouldn't recommend this toy at all. I am extremely unhappy with it - it shouldn't cost $50 for such a shoddy toy! (My 4 year old son wants to return it as well.)"
1,No working cannon as advertised,I chose this ship over others because the Amazon site description said it had a working cannon with balls. It does not. After opening the box to assemble the ship and it became clear that it was not as advertised I discovered a small white sticker on the side of the box that states the US version does not have a working cannon and balls. This is dishonest advertising that needs to be remedied. Very frustrating.
3,no cannon ball,When ordering this pirate ship for my grandson I loved that it would have a working cannon with balls. Upon recieving the item we discovered that it does not have a working cannon . A small label on the side states that the US version Cannon only (non-firing cannon ballls not included) The discription of the product on amazon did not mention this.Wooden Barbarossa Pirate Ship
4,Pretty good.,My son really wanted this for Christmas but quickly lost interest. It seems well made but was somewhat difficult to assemble.
1,No Life Batteries,I think these batteries should be advertised .10 year life not 10. They do not last ANYWHERE near advertised. Don't waste your money.
3,quick life,Went dead in about 3 days.Not sure why but it bit the dust rather quickly. Had to throw it out!
5,Great battery,The battery lasts 4 times as long as the store shelf brands and only cost twice as much; you do the math!
4,I've had 5 last about 5 years,I got 5 of them for smoke alarms. I just had to change one out 1 week short of 5 years. Time to change them all so I don't have to get up in the middle of the night!I am pretty pleased as I paid less than 5x an alkaline and not having to change them every year is the reason I got them.
1,rip off,"I put these in smoke alarms to take advantage of the 10 year life. They are, at best, no better then standard alkaline battery. Amazon should stop carrying this item since they do notperform as advertised. This is, no doubt, a very profitable product for the company making them and apparently getting away with false advertising that misleads the customers who truststhe claim of 10 years along with trusting Amazon to screen out products like this. Amazon doesn't seem to care as this fradulent product is sold year after year."
1,Does not last as advertised,These batteries claim to last for 10 years so I bought several for smoke alarms.After a year one of my alarms is chirping that the battery needs replacing.AVOID!
1,"Maybe improved, maybe not.","January, 2012 review notes company has switched back to original formulation to give usage life advertised. I began using five in our home smoke detectors in June, 2010. By September, 2011 one had failed and the remainder failed by November, 2011, all in the middle of the night I assume due to lower temperature at that time. I would be leery of buying these until there are more reports confirming at least a five year usage life. I will not be buying any Ultralife batteries until then. Too bad since battery says they are made in USA."
2,"Low life, high cost","Although the manufacturer claims the battery lasts up to 5 years, my batteries ran out in 2 years. I am using these batteries in smoke detectors."
1,"Do not last, poor durability","I bought two of these Ultralife 9V batteries and placed each of them in a different outdoor motion detector. The previous Duracell Alkaline 9V battery lasted 2 years. The first one of these failed after 15 days, the second one lasted 4 months. Others have reported poor durability when used in other types of devices. Bad deal due to unproven claims.I guess we need to wait until a reknown company like Duracell or Energizer comes up with a real working version like they have with the CR 123."
1,gambit?,"A 10-yr. battery that lasts less than one year? Is there some lobbyist thing going on here where a maufacturer gets a law to require the installation of a 10-yr. battery in a smoke detector and then abuses the law with a more expensive 9 volt that lasts as long as any of the other 9 volt batteries?I mistakenly used DURALIFE in my previous complaint...... I do apologise to any company named DURALIFE.Who do you think you are, ULTRALIFE?"
1,50% failure rate for sealed batteries,"I've been using these batteries for over a decade. I usually buy 10 at a time. The last batch I purchased had a 50% failure rate. Opening the sealed package had batteries with leaks, discolored bodies and low voltage.Several attempts at contacting the manufacturer, including filling out the RMA form have been 100% ignored. They even have section on the website dedicated for RMAs for the batteries, so it's clear that they know about the problems.Won't ever touch anything with the Ultralife name on it.There are now other choices such as Energizer for lithium 9V cells. At least they actually honor their warranty."
2,Be careful!,"These batteries are just a bit bigger that conventional alkalines. I installed in two identical smoke alarms and one would not accommodate this product. The smoke alarm seemed to work for a while but then started chirping. The battery tested fine, I just think the fit did not allow the proper contacts to be maintained. I let you know if the other one fails as well!"
1,disappointing,"Arhipelago candles are my favorite. The scents are exotic, clean, and aromatic. This candle smelled great in the box, but when I burn it all I smell is hot wax. I'll stay away from their holiday stuff for now on."
5,One of the Originals,"I first bought this book in 1989, and it has had a prominent place on my bookshelf ever since. I still love this book as much as the first time I opened it, and respect the ground breaking work of the designers whom it is about. The photography alone is outstanding.It opened my eyes to many possibilities and the idea of comfortable elegance in decoration. This in an era where comfort seemed to have lost out to precsion or uneasy experimentation in American design.Being a designer for over 20 years has only strengthened my respect for the magic John Fowler, Sibyl Colefax and Nancy Lancaster brought to interior design. They were the inspiration for many decorators extraordinaire that have since sprung up to hold sway in more recent years: Mario Buatta, Arthur Hadley, Mark Hampton, as well as many others. What the book may lack in technical information, it more than makes up for in inspiration."
5,simplistic,"No handwriting required and no over-the-head scientific explanations. It is clear, simple, and EASY to pull off the shelf and use. I recommend previewing the list of materials for the week to be sure you have the needed items. Substitutions can effect the experiment. I use this with ages 4-10 and they ALL enjoy the experiments. The experiments are simplistic and easy for young children to grasp the idea yet have enough information to get the parents thought process going! A great introduction to chemistry that takes very little time to prep and do. I even use this book as birthday party entertainment! A favorite with us."
5,Excellent compass,"This is a great compass. It's accurate (by comparison to other compasses), it's capsule rotates smoothly and is not loose, and it's set-and-forget declination adjustment works just fine. I bought one of these for myself . . . but my wife saw it and, well, borrowed it. So I had to buy another. 'buff said."
1,Deception,"The concert is amazing, but the video quality is not good.It's a shame because I paid dearly for the product and had great expectations."
1,retirement home rockers,"It didn't help that I had just watched the Queen at Wembly DVD prior to Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyve-The Vicious Cycle Tour. I couldn't make it all the way through. I found myself skipping over some because it was so pitiful to see great rockers not realize that they were too old to do this. They all were flipping their hair around like FOO FIGHTERS and looked rediculous. The band was tired and obviously 'born again' as they all had large Christian Croses on and even sang a song holding the Cross. In the end, ""Free Bird"" was tried and failed. So sorry I wasted my money on this DVD. I'll listen to my old CD and try not to remember the tired old tubs that now make up Lynyrd Skynyrd."
4,Don't Ask Questions. Just Buy It.,If you like good quality rock then this is for you. There are no slackers in this line up. I just loved the drummer.I reckon that even someone with the greatest of willpower would be hard put to stop their feet from tapping. This show is truly electric.I know that this is not the original line up but for obvious reasons this cannot be.The only reason I didn't give this the full five stars was that it was shot in widescreen letterbox and not in 16:9 (I refer to UK edition).
4,Critical assessmet of what makes a good game or simulation.,"Whatever your views are on the validity of games and simulations within a training or education environment, this book helps the reader to vet the game or simulation being examined, to ensure it delivers valid educational outcomes. The author catagorizes games and simulations and then critically discusses the desired outcomes and repercusions. Even if you may disagree with some of the authors findings, it forces the reader to examine the the structure and context of the game or simulation. For authors of games and simulations it provides a reality check of outcomes, answering the question: is the game or simulation delivering what it is designed to?"
4,hand held Ship to Shore radio,I purchased this same unit from a different vendor 6 months prior and was very pleased with it . I was waiting for someone to have this same item on sale at the same price and I got free shipping . I felt it was a very good deal for the price.
5,woodland fresh spray,This product lives up to the reviews I read before I purchased. A great shine. No noxious odor. As I have a lot of wood in my home I ordered 3 more bottles.
1,Waste of money,"Decided to buy Trendnet hub because I was happy with their other products - namely 2 routers and ethernet switch. With TU2-700 they did a bad job, I hooked up 7 USB->serial converters which don't draw more than 50mA each and only 4 devices got recognized by Windows - others were going up and down all the time in Windows device manager, and when I unpugged 3 devices the remaining 4 would stop communicating with a PC within half an hour. I ended up buying D-Link DUB-H7 and never had a problem since, use same setup."
1,Overheated; functioned poorly. Returned....,"I hate to return items. This overheated and did not function properly, so I returned it...."
1,7 port USB Hub,"This product is no good. Did not work correctly, got hot after plugging in and hung up my computer everytime I tried to log on. Do not recommend."
4,Offers Plenty Of Inlets/Outlets for Multiple Hookups.,"If you need a way to connect a lot of cords to one hub, this is a good way to go. The price is right. My only concern (and it may just be the nature of these devices) is that it seems to get warm to the touch. I leave it connected to my computer all the time - even when there are no Input/Output cords attached to it. I do not know if that is the correct way to do things but so far it appears to be doing what it was designed to do."
5,Great price. Works fine. Easy setup.,"I bought this adapter because of the price. (...). I followed the instructions and had it up and running in a few minutes. Have had no problems thus far, but it has only been a day."
1,A real SNOOZER.....,"By the cover, I thought this might be a visual treat....Venice is beautiful.....but all the DVD shows is people walking, and eating, and sitting....no real thrill. I can do that here with my camcorder on the pond out back! It's all played out to classical music, which is pretty, but I have heard this all before played better.The companion cd is just as dull. Even though the cover is stunning...that's where it ends."
2,Cheap Plastic,"The blade on this knife is thick a sharp right out of the box. The back locker is easy on the thumb and doesn't take a lot of pressure to unlock. The nylon sheath is good quality and stylish. BUT, the handle is nothing more than cheap plastic, and they only put a metal liner along half of the handle, so if you give it a little squeeze you can almost feel it cracking in your hand. If you drop this or whack it against something then there is a good chance it will break. I have no confidence that the handle will hold up to even mild abuse. This knife is only good for opening cardboard boxes and pruning roses."
4,Good knife.,I just purchased this knife last week and I do like it alot. I only give a 4 star rating because I have larger hands and although the grip would be great for someone with smaller hands it just doesn't fit perfect for me. I wear an XL glove so if your a large or smaller glove size I think you will love this Buck knife.
5,buck omni hunter/folding 10pt,i bought this knife at acadmy in camo and i love it i take it every were with me the sheath is really cool too it has a belt loop and is made out of nylon thats good because if it was lether after time it would start to dry up and crack its light weight and could easily skin any animal u want
3,Good but not their best,"This is a good effort from this band, but, unless you're a fan who needs all of their recordings, try another cd."
5,Art for arts sake!,"I usually do not take the time to write reviews, but this Moby release is an absolute trend setter for the music industry!A CD at a reasonable price - I paid CAN$ 14.99 or US$11.00 - and it contains a mountain of extras that most other artists releases as supplements and ask their fans to spend even more money on.The quality of both the CD and the Bonus material is first rate and shows that Moby is a true artist in various art forms.I only hope that some music industry execs read this, because in my humble opinion this is the answer to their woes; not law suits! Build it and they will come!Thomas"
4,"Great for reading, especially in the evening","Great for reading, especially in the evenings when normal bulbs make the page look yellow. Not great if you want ambient light - but then again, that's not it's purpose. When sitting under it you'll feel a little like a plant under a grow lamp, but it really is excellent for reading. I probably sit and read for 2-3 hours at a time with no eye strain at all. Nice finish, too. Looks far more expensive that it is."
1,"Extraordinarily sturdy, but very dim light","I wanted a good reading lamp and bought this lamp after doing a bit of research. After taking the very heavy lamp out of the box and assembling it, I turned it on to find that it gives off very little light. I thought it might be something I would need to get used to and sat down that night to read only to find that my eyes were straining under the light. I tried using the lamp during the day/twilight and found that the illumination of the lamp was barely noticable. Though it was quite a feat to put the lamp back into the box it was shipped in, I returned it to Amazon which is something I rarely do."
2,Great light but lamp structure weak,"I agree with the reviews about the quality of lighting. It is a different type of light but is well worth the small amount of effort required to get used to it.The problem is with the build quality on the lamp structure. The lamp looks sturdy, but appearances can be deceiving. We bought two of these lamps three years ago. Periodically, it is necessary to tighten the screw fittings as they do loosen over time. That is not a big deal. On one of our lamps, however, the fitting has worn so it is no longer possible to tighten the lamp at the base, which means the lamp can no longer stand upright. For a lamp this price, a three year life span just does not cut it.Update: I spoke with customer service, who said there is no way to repair and no replacement part. So buyer beware."
2,Light is hard to work by,"My wife bought this because she found it attractive and bought the hype about the ""natural spectrum"" light. Unfortunately, she planned to use it to quilt by. The light from this lamp is kind of strange and not easy to work by; to thread the needle, she needs to go over to her desk and work under the desk lamp. If I could buy a normal CFC bulb for it instead of only the special Verilux bulb, we might be happier with it. As it is, we're stuck. I'd recommend buying a lamp that can at least accept a standard bulb so you have some options if you don't like it."
3,limited adjustments,I like this lamp enough but it has limited adjustments. It needs a flex joint to achieve a more percise adjustment. It also could be brighter.
3,Floor Lamp,Better than the previous lamp product we owned by Verilux which went bad after less than 2 years. Love the natural light. Pole wants to lean a little.
1,Busted,"I am putting this lamp out for the trash tonight. It worked fine for a few months of infrequent, gentle use, then for no reason at all stopped working. A replacement bulb also did not work. The lamp cannot be easily repaired or returned. So it has been a piece of expensive and completely nonfunctional home decor. You take your chances when you purchase this lamp. (Oh, and if yours happens to function, don't plan to use it on a carpeted surface and have it stay stable; I had to put a piece of plywood under mine.)"
4,BULL PROOF LAMP,"My children joke about this lamp after my husband told them that it was ""hundreds of dollars."" You won't laugh at this though. It is high quality, child proof, knock-over proof (meaning it hasn't broken), and a great reading lamp. This is also recommended to treat seasonal depression for the winter blues in gloomy weather. The only downfall is that you can't count on this to light up a room. There is actually kind of a haze created above the lamp. No problem when sitting under it. I worry more about the floor when the kids knock it over, and this only happens when they ""charge like bull."" The lamp hasn't broken, had the bulb go out, dented, etc."
5,Great lamp--bulb hard to put in,"I was very excited to purchase this. Assembly was easy, too (I'm a female, age 65). The light is fantastic! I love it and can't wait to read under it. However, as a word of caution, the four-pronged light fixture that is to snap into place was definitely a hardship. I know this can't be factory-installed, because it wouldn't pack well enough (the packing was exceptional, BTW), but I tried for nearly 20 minutes putting it in, taking it out, reinserting, then plugging the cord into the wall outlet in the hope that it would light up. I was almost to the point of thinking I had to return it, but finally, by some miracle, I held it, I think, at a slight angle, then somehow it snapped into place. Wow! What a relief! My point in writing is only to help someone not give up, in case this happens to them. The light is the best I've ever had. Didn't mind paying this price at all. One's eyes are worth it."
5,Excellent resource for kids,"After reading the original Pilgrim's Progress, I wanted to share the story with my 6 year old son. Christian's Journey is a wonderful adaptation which makes the story much more appealing to today's children.The story is well written, the pictures are big and colorful, and there is a Faith Parenting Guide at the end which gives some ideas for discussion after each chapter. I highly recommend this book!"
3,This was the worst National Lampoon movie ever made!,"If you are really into the sterotypes of highschool,and the students that inhabit it, you will love this movie. However, if you are like me, and believe that most movies put out about HS students are total BS, then don't even bother. Why the three stars then, you ask? Kevin McDonald, one of the Kids in the Hall plays a rather strange treki/crossing gaurd. He was the only thing that made this movie somewhat tolerable. END"
3,Very 90's,"I saw this movie Almost 15 years ago when it first came out, and I was about 13 years old. We all like movies that we enjoyed as children. This was one of mine. My husband watched it with me for the first time and also enjoyed it, even as a grown man. If you like stupid immature humor, then you should definately watch this movie!"
4,I wish I went to this high school.,"Before there were teen movie parodies, there was National Lampoon's. I love comedies, but this has to be one of my favorites. This is the tale of the stuff kids can get into that their parents never find out about. My favorite character in the movie is the flamer, a man who believes that he's Capton Kirk with a blow up doll to boot. The only bad thing about this movie is the ending is under climactic, but that's what all are teen years lead up to."
4,Enojoyable but not a classic.,This movie is one were you do not have to actively watch in order to know what is going on. Good for late high school-college age students.
4,reasonably amusing,"Anyone who appreciates satire will find this movie pretty funny. The irony of the situation is that the movie is ""not sold to persons under 18."" The truth of the matter is, it's mostly people under 18 who will find this amusing. It's not bad to watch once, and it's better to watch it with a group of friends (who can always be trusted to supply funny lines where the dialogue is lacking!)."
1,Don't Waste Your $$,"Although I have liked the National Lampoon flicks and have seen them all (several are in my all-time favorite category), this one, except for Tommy Chong is a total waste of time. Tommy plays a minor role but is the only character who does not overact as a compensation for terrible writing. And that is the great flaw here since it is generally well cast. The writing is horrible and trying to find a laugh is not easy... a few smiles maybe... and I was in the mood for a good laugh. Mind you, I do like most comedies... event those the critics do not like. Save your money."
5,Love this movie,This movie is definitely worth it if you are into crazy school kid humor. It's a bummer that there aren't really any good special features. Oh well. Long live the Dope King!
2,Typical National Lampoon movie,"I just watched this to see Jeremy Renner's first movie. It was a typical ""10 year old boy humor"" National Lampoon movie, but it had some redeeming value."
3,Spiderman 3 Secret Lab Assault Mega Lego Set,"Some of the pieces are quite small and difficult to snap together. Our six-year-old grandson and his grandfather built it together the day after Christmas, with the grandson mostly watching because the pieces were too small for him to snap together securely. Now that it's together, he is enjoying playing with it."
3,Ok but a little bit out of date,"The book is ok. Unfortunately is a little bit old and that could be a problem for people very interested in th field.The approach of the book is quite practical, but lacks more scientific background."
5,"Hey Folks, Infidelity Here!!!!!","I just want to say thank you, for either purchasing, or considering on purchasing this cd. For those who don't know what these songs sound like, you can find a select few on my MySpace Music Page!! - [...]Just copy and paste that link into your web browser.Due to some lack of communication with myself and Sonic Wave International, the cd only comes with lyrics for 1 song. The above link I posted, will have the remaining lyrics for you all.Once again, thank you each and every one of you!! -Lloyd Russell"
2,"Not professional, but not horrible","I am a French teacher and I bought this to show my students (particularly the part about Chenonceaux). I really wish I could have previewed parts of it before buying (good thing it was only $2.99!) This is essentially a very long home video of their vacation to France, much like you find in shorter versions on Youtube. The section on Chenonceaux appears to be shot in the fall and does not make the chateau look particularly attractive. The interior shots are quite dark and full of background noise. Also, the information is not very in-depth. However, I do appreciate the ""hosts"" enthusiasm and their love of France is quite evident. I may use short sections of it to show my students, but I would not subject them to watching the whole thing in one sitting."
1,stick with rick steves and rudy maxa`,"this is a very poor amatuer production, poor sound track, poor camera work, poor theme in general."
3,Kept me curious throughout,"I read this book after readingThe Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grailand was deeply moved by it. Within a short while, the small church of Rennes-le-Chteau in the remote village of southern France had become my primary concern.This book makes no bones about the fact that Mary Magdalenes married Jesus and created a bloodline. It vety clearly attempts to establish that Mary Magdalene was a high priestess whose primary responsibility was to ""initiate"" Jesus, a position taken by several books recently includingThe Rozabal Line.I loved the book even though at times I felt that the pace could have picked up a little. The good thing is that it kept my curiosity level high enough to want to reach the end."
5,Three paths to nirvana,An incredible book analysing the more scientific aspects of meditation. Discusses the underlying basis of meditation from the viewpoint of three major religeons of the world. An insightful and exceptionally thought provoking book. Inpires a desire to delve into deeper realms. I currently share a very old and dog-eared copy with my family and am looking for a new one. Please e-mail me if you can help.
5,Floyd & the guys are great!,"I have listened to Intercept and have seen them live- what a great classic metal band in the making. Soul Collector is a great tune, as are their others. These guys work hard and I firmly believe their hard work will pay off. Anyone who likes good rock(AC/DC,etc),will love this CD. And there is a video for Soul Collector that is screaming ""intensity""! Kudos to the band and all those involved with the making of this great CD. I would like to see bios on the band members- I think others would, too. Women-take a peek when photos are available- these guys are HOT!!"
1,Intercept really has no depth,after seeing them try to hold onto the 80s stage show. and lacking vocals and a sound guy that must be tone deaf i would not suggest this or any intercept cd or live show. 7 string guitars are a prop not to be used on every song. and hey lead singer quit pulling away from the mic and try projecting your voice for a change. or maybe just move over and let the younger generation propell the name intercept while u retire to a old hasbeen rockers home.
2,Why people like this book,"A lot of programmers really love this book. It will arm you with a dozen good juicy quotes that will support your argument that your manager is an idiot.Lets say you are late and another programmer is assigned to help you out - you can simply point to this book and explain how adding more programmers to a late project will just make it later. If that one doesn't fit. you can surely find another one that does.If you liked ""Catcher in the Rye"" or ""The Peter Principle"" you may like this book too.Software management is hard - mostly because there is a great deal of variation in the talent and productivity of computer programmers.This book is a fun read - and food for thought. And in its defense I must admit it has changed the way I think about large software projects.But sadly, beyond the fun quotes and maxims (which often contradict each other) there is not much to help you get the job done."
5,"Philosophical essays on software, projects and purpose","This book is a classic for a reason. Every essay by Frederick P. Brooks Jr. addresses software engineering and proves invaluable for those interested in the history and processes of that field. getAbstract also recommends Brooks' book to anyone who plans or organizes major projects. The collection remains timely due to the clarity of his thought and the educated loveliness of his prose. When Brooks is writing about programming, he's never just writing about programming. He's writing about the complexities of life, and about how best to plan, organize and communicate the concepts you need to overcome those complexities. This 20th-anniversary edition contains new essays in which Brooks reflects on his earlier writing - especially his principles and predications - and responds to his critics. The result showcases a singular, markedly honest mind at work."
5,Time Less,Few books written about software engineering have value a few years after introduction. But Brooks is time less! This is a must read by anyone who craft is computer science. I would also suggest it to anyone who is in technology managment. It is very readable and very usable.
5,Still no silver bullet,"The wonderful thing about Fred's classic book on software engineering is that it is grounded in reality, not theory. Because of this, the advice in this book is truly timeless. While the entire book is great, I especially want to point out the relevance of ""No Silver Bullet"", the final essay added years after the rest of the book was written. This essay tellingly predicted (in 1988) that programming ""Fads"" won't make the business of writing software significantly easier. He named a number of fads that have since either passed into oblivion, or been added into the basic toolbox of today's software engineer -- who still labors just as hard as his counterpart of of 10, 20 and 30 years ago. Writing software is hard. It will never be easy. If only the multi-million dollar Internet startups that thought they could reinvent the world had understood that lesson..."
5,Old lessons that are still valid today,"I first saw this book in a college bookstore in 1976. I did not buy it then, and have seen it referenced several times through the years as a significant computer science text. Well, I finally decided to hunt it down and buy it!After reading it, I am sure glad I did. Even though few might remember the IBM 360, the lessons learned are still valid today -- like ""adding resources to a late project makes it later."" With proof.This particular edition includes a follow up by Dr. Brooks written 20 years after the first edition was published. He is very frank about how he has changed his mind over the years (not much, but some), and the whole chapter shows a glimpse of the mind of one of the great men in the field.Now I wish I had it in hardback..."
4,A insightful book about software project development,"I have been a software project manager for many years. One of the biggest problem that I encountered was what the author called as ""Second System Effect"". Some times, architects were unable to discipline himself to avoid over-designing systems in the second project. Their goals were to build perfect systems that would streamline all processes without considering the costs and patience of business groups. To convince others that they were right, they could come up with various reasons that sounded very reasonable. Unfortunately, they were not aware of the cost, time window for product delivery, and etc.This books provided insightful view about this effect. If our architects could have read this book, they could avoid such problems and became more successful."
5,Timeless advice,"The advice on this book is timeless, it still applies to technology projects today, as it did in the 1970s. It is just human nature that doesn't change."
4,Classic,This book is a classic and rightfully so. It covers the processes and methods of software development rather than the nitty-gritty details of programming. It's interesting to see what lessons were learned while large projects were worked on and it's great as a reference to compare your own projects and work environment to.
5,Sofware Engineering Requirement,The Mythical Man-Month and the Soul of a New Machine should be required reading for sofware engineers. It's unfortunate that computer programmers are still be churned out like word processing operators who know a language syntax and nothing about engineering software.
3,"Good general arguments, difficult to read","A lot of pieces of this book are really great, and maybe every software developer chief need to read this at least one time.I found little difficult read it (as a non-natual english user) and also examples given are 20 years old... a lot of reference to long-dead systems and techniques are passed."
2,Great book; miserable ebook formatting,"A classic book updated with more recent thoughts by the author. I bought the ebook and was greatly disappointed by the formatting, especially of Chapter 18, the recapitulation of the author's original theses. On my Kindle 2, for example, only parts of the propositions from Chapter 2 show. Advancing the page doesn't help. Reducing the font size shows that the ""missing"" material is there but the tiny font makes reading impossible.Buy the paperback, by all means, but Addison-Wesley needs to take this abomination of an ebook.off the market. Professor Brooks deserves far better."
4,"Correct, but...","If you don't already agree with the author, you won't be convinced by this book. If you agree with the author, then there is nothing new in it for you."
5,A must-read for project leads in the software industry,An excellent book and a must-have for all those involved in the software industry. The concepts and problems described in this book are still valid to this day in our modern software development process.I recommend this book to everyone active in the field of software development.
3,While I may take heat for this but...,"I have to admit, I did feel as I was reading that the text was a bit outdated and while I agree to many of the topics in the book there were also a lot of times I found myself thinking about some of the problems he had presented in the book as not being as applicable anymore. Perhaps its the semi-dated stories, the book (or at the least the second edition I had read) is already 15 years old. While I do feel I got some good information out of it, it would not be in the ""if I you only could read one programming book this year"" conversation."
5,The baseline reference.,"You simply can't have an honest argument about software engineering without the background this book provides. The canonical explanation of how adding manpower can make late projects later. The 2nd edition graciously admits some shortsightedness of the 1st, which somehow manages to emphasize how the rest of it has remained true decades later. (For a good counterpoint, I'd suggest the eXtreme Programming series.)"
3,"The Mythical Man-Month, Anniversary Edition","An interesting read, but you have to cut through a lot of yester year talk to get to the important messages. It is a book to shove under the nose of any CEO, executive or management dead weight, who needs a reminder or a wake up call. A book for university reading but a bit old fashioned for modern day project management at web speed. Speed read until it gets to the important messages."
4,"Great book, yet old","This is a great book for software engineering. However, it is not a reference book for you to learn the SE in general, rather it is a book pushing you hard to think the SE in general. The book has a age of more than 20 years, but most conclusions are correct. Being a software architect, how sad I am !"
5,Must read for anyone making a living out of software engineering,"Doesn't matter if you are software engineer or VP of software engineering, you are trying to make money from the software engineering. This book really help you to avoid making mistakes in that software lifecycle. The case studies in the book still hold good for your own project and many times in the book, you will end up saying ""oh, something very similar happened in my project too!!"". While certain section of planning memory requirements of compute resources might be outdated now, but it is still useful."
2,Moldy Oldy,"There was a time when this book rocked. That time has passed. Although there is still useful info here you have to slog through so much old useless references, stories and crap that it seems hardly worth the effort. Particularly when there are other more useful books that I can invest my efforts in."
2,Meh,I understand the need for this book many years ago. I also understand the need to criticize this book now. I just do not like the writing style or the antiquated ideas of Brooks.
3,Not that useful - pretty out-dated,"This book is supposed to be a classic about software project management, maybe because it was the first to actually cover the topic and offer advice and solutions back in the 70s. Even though most principles still apply, the arguments have aged rather badly and do not translate very well in nowadays environment. I have the feeling I haven't learnt anything that I didn't already know, which is somehow frustrating."
2,Watch it for Vincent Spano,"Thrills, suspense, violence...All this with a sweet undertone of an innocent child. Carradine and Hannah played two psychotic killers...a great stretch for their normal roles. They were both convincingly scary, and I wouldn't want to come across them in the middle of the night. Sour story of spree killing. Not recommended for young children. If you love Vincent Spano, he does an excellent job in this movie. I watched this movie because he was in it. He gets 100 stars from me."
2,Disappointing,"I watched it coz it wasfrom the same maker(s) of ""The hand that rocks the cradle"" & I had high expectations. All I can say is it's no near to that movie & this film is such a disappointment."
4,Good film.,"The actor performances were excellent, especially Daryll Hannah and Moira Kelly. The movie is never boring and I feel it is very underrated. The ending is full of fiery action and I think that it is one of the better thrillers(more than Single White Female and Fatal Attraction). I'd reccommend it. The color , pans, and tilts in the cinematography along with the music make the film very intimate and enjoyable."
2,BLU RAY AUDIO HORRIBLE!,"I could not believe what I was hearing from this disc! I thought my ears were messed up, then I thought my tv audio was messed up. Then I did a search online to confirm I was not the only one with this complaint. There is this echoing sound throughout the entire movie that sounds like a jet overhead or underwater whooshing, to an echoing in a cave, or the hissing of a flare. It is the worst audio I have ever heard on any format ever produced by a professional distributor. We should all be refunded for the cost of this item and replaced for free! The sound makes this movie nearly unbearable. This product has just lowered the bar on blu ray expectations."
3,Entertaining thriller,I found this film to be suspenseful even though the plot sometimes seems to be implausable.The main actors did a decent job in their roles.I would recommend the film as being entertaining but sometimes melodramatic.
4,"Shoulda been an American hit, too.","It's sad that this musical never became a hit in the U.S., even though ""The Lambeth Walk"" became fairly big. I don't have the CD (yet), but I found an old vinyl copy in a local Goodwill store; the score is marvelous, Robert Lindsay deserved all the awards he received, and Emma Thompson (before we Yanks heard of her) is a revelation. It's all good, clean musical fun."
4,Incomplete,"Dont get me wrong these are all classic, incredible recordings. But its incomplete,they could have added more tracks from those legendary sun sessions. Other compilations have surfaced through the years including extra tracks. You'll want more, no doubt about it."
1,piece of junk,"I bought this to replace an old flute that I have, thinking that since it was brand new, that it would be better than getting an overhaul on my old one. Several keys would not sound, lousy tone on the notes that would. Really cheap. It was about the same price to overhaul my old flute. Lesson learned: play the instrument before you lay money down."
1,Bad product.,"I had high hopes for this product. Alas, it did not work for me, but the bear thought it added flavor."
2,Can't really suggest this to anyone,"The entire book is very short and can easily be read by anyone in just a couple of days. By the end I was thinking to myself ""that's it?"". In all those pages, this is all they can come up with, after all the years of experience? The book could have been a little more deep and went a little further. To be really honest, I could pretty much describe to you what the entire book tells us in just a few sentences. I guess I don't know what I was expecting. All of this to me is common sense information most everyone already knows. Like, if you want to swim, you've got to just jump in the water. I wouldn't expect anyone to agree with me, but this is just one person's opinion. I'm sure it might be very useful for some people."
3,"Not bad, but not the one to start with","Although this CD certainly has its moments, it's by far the weakest entry in her very impressive discography. Get the others first!"
2,"A Fine First Effort, But....","This album of Marisa's is fine, but it is clear she is trying to work out her musical style. She swings wildly between Mo-town and classic Bossa Nova. Unless you are interested in owning all of MM's albums, I recommend buying any of her other albums first."
3,A sign of things to come...,"I love Marisa, but I don't listen to her first CD much. Not that it's bad--it's actually a sign of a very talented artist destined for great things--but it's not the brilliant direction she ended up taking. All of the songs are good, but my favorite has to be her cover of ""Chocolate"" by the late R&B/soul singer Tim Maia. Good listening, but I'd have to say it's one for the collector."
1,"Marisa fan:""Just plain awful!""","I am one of Marisa's biggest fans-I absolutely love all of her other CDs, but I feel I have the duty to warn any unsuspecting Marisa fans that this album is just plain awful. Even on the first listening of this CD its clear that Marisa is yet to find her voice or her sound. At times on the album she sounds like a female impersonating Louis Armstrong. And the songs in english? Someone should've taught her the songs phonetically-they are so bad, they're humorous!!! This album doesn't even have one song that would merit its purchase. Go buy Rosa e carvao instead!!!"
5,Marisa's essence,"This has got to be the MM album I have listened to the most. I am aware that it incarnates a search for her musical style but I find that the producer had very well targeted the right styles for her wide range of talent. She sings jazz, Motown and Brazilian rock and bossa nova. It reveals, more than her latter albums, the adaptability of her voice to almost any musical situation. I say bravo ! I am a singer too and use this album for training. Very rich."
4,Great gift for kids,"I purchased these and the pirates of the caribbean ones as gifts for my nieces and consins kids and they just loved them, specially when they light up. So, I bought more of them. The reason for giving 4 stars is because the feathers keep falling. Still great gift."
4,Use to wash baby's face,"I use these to wash my daughter's face since unlike the baby wash cloth products, there is no soap. I just wish they were a little softer."
5,Big k's review,"I have listened to the music of the Red Blaze Band and I believe it is among the top's in North Amarican country music. I've seen them play also, they do a good show. I recomend this artist(s) music to everyone who likes good country music."
2,"Elements: series, Desert Light, Quiet Moods, Great Reef","This is not bad for the $ and in the one I purchased you actually get two discs, one a DVD and the other a CD. It is relatively relaxing. The clouds flying by are not that relaxing and can be disturbing at times, they are too fast, but the scenes are exquisite. The Native American flutes are very relaxing. There are what I see, as major flaws in the DVD though, the major one being a long blank screen gap between the chapters, which kills the relaxation experience. It really isn't sold as a relaxation CD or DVD. I purchased my first copy of a series of Elements sets at Borders. I was looking for relaxation DVDs so I thought I would give it a try. The first one was of the Great Barrier Reef. Absolutely beautiful, but the shark scenes and the divers ruined the relaxation response.I guess you get what you pay for. I don't listen to the music very often, I bought them for the scenery."
1,The hardest timer to program I have seen.,"I'm sure this unit functions nicely if one can figure out how to get the programming done. I'm quite technical, and this unit is a mess to program. I ordered the Sylvania unit at the same time. In 20 minutes of messing with the Intermatic, I still did not have it programmed. The Sylvania unit was up, programmed, and working in 5 minutes. Maybe less. I'm not even going to use the Intermatic. It's so inferior to the Sylvania. The Sylvania is VERY intuitive and clear to use. I don't know who devised the Intermatic or the instructions that come with it, but I find it comparatively useless.I'd order this one instead of what you are looking at on this page:Sylvania 15 Amp Digital Lamp Timer #SA130"
2,Expect it to work for one year.,"I bought two of these, they both lasted almost exactly a year, and they both quit within two days of each other! Up until then they worked flawlessly without worry."
2,Short Lifespan,Purchased three of these units and 2 have failed for the same reason. It seems the output relay eventually fails to operate manually or automatically. I am a electrical professional and this is not the first Intermatic product I have used that has failed prematurely. I am now seeking another brand.
2,"OK it's better than the DT-17, but it still stinks","Well, at least you can figure out how to program it, but it willstill drive you crazy. (Hint: Always press 'Day' before entering a time).It's *very* frustrating to advance to the time you want. I mean, did they test this before it went into production?The display is too small, hard to tell if it is on or off."
1,difficult,arrived promptly and in good condition but after a week of ownership they are still not installed. I am not technically challaged but that must be the worst instruction manual ever. i still have not figured out to just have them turn on and off in the evenings at random times. shounds easy? Maybe with another timer....
4,"Great, but....","This Timer is great, but it would be even better if it allowed you to turn it off and on again between sundown and sunup. I use it for my night lights in various parts of the house. I never have to adjust it because of the changing length in spring and fall. It would be even better if it would shut off when the family goes to bed."
4,Works well but can be difficult to program,"Pros: Automatic adjustment for the seasonal changes in sunrise and sunset, convenient switch on front for manual on/off, easy to read display.Cons: Programming instructions are difficult to understand."
2,It's like a floating overworn Roc that wears out FAST...,"I got this looking for a stable floating disc with some distance. It delivered on one of those promises... It floats... I hoped being 178g would keep it from turning over, but no chance. It's extremely flippy... It has the distance of a Roc... And it's beyond broken in after hitting about 2 trees. Lots of gouges very quickly..."
4,Good Vaccum Sealer,"The product works well; though, if you are sealing a lot of bags, it tends to overheat and requires time to cool down before it is operable again. Bags are a little expensive."
5,Works every time,I have been using this Food Saver for years. I love it. Nothing bad to say about it.
4,Food Saver Christmas Present,"We wanted one of these and after reading a lot of reviews, we picked the Food Saver 2440. I tried it on a couple of things from Grapes to a Steak and it worked great."
4,good customer service,"I haven't had this item long enough yet to speak to usage. I bought mine and did not receive the hose. The customer service rep I spoke to was very kind and did not in any way give me a hard time. I just wanted to bring this up because I'd heard bad things about their customer service, and that was not my experience at all.(Using it out of the box was very easy with their quick start instructions, too)"
5,Great product,"My husband wanted to try one of these appliances to save our garden produce, after researching we settled on this one, haven't been disappointed. It's easy to use, does what it says it does, like the upgraded buttons that are sealed so you don't get dirt around them. Quality and features are worth it."
4,Given as Gift,I gave this to my Mother as a gift. She couldn't use her old machine anymore due to not having any strenght in her hands to hold it down. She loves this one because it does everything itself. I have no first hand knowledge of how it works but Mom likes it.
1,Didn't work out of the box,"Just bought this Foodsaver 2240 BS. I see that it is getting great reviews. Not for us. It is not sealing moist food. We have read the instructions: pre freeze the moist food (this was such an ordeal), then put into the bags, make sure you have lots of inches at least 4, we even put a small piece of paper towel down by the food to catch any moisture. THen vacuum and lots of noise from the machine, the light goes off and nothing----it does not vacuum. I hope this review gets printed--to see the other side. Thanks."
5,FoodSaver V2440,"This is a great product. Many things were in the instructions which are not generally known, and make the product even more functional."
5,Food Saver,This is a great item. It helps because you can buy the larger amount of food or meats and freeze them and they keep much longer with no freezer burn or ice build up on. I would recommend this for anyone....easy to use.
1,mine did not work from the start,"Made a lot of noise but very little vaccume. I used the cannister hose to help troubleshoot where the problem might be, that's when I determined there was little vaccume. There was no vaccume at all when a bag was in it, not even at the fast setting. It made quite a racket, I don't think it's supposed to do that. It seems like a relativly simple machine, but since it's a discontinued model maybe it got banged around a lot or something. Who knows. I'm bummed.I still am encouraged by foodsaver owners of differant models, and I sit here with lots of food to freeze, so I am going to go by sams or walmart to find a differant model that might work.edit to add:I got the upright fully model at walmart and it works fine. It sounds nothing like the V2440, it makes a sound but it's not as loud and does not vibrate. It's pretty easy to use, although I would really rather not had a fully automatic one. I'll review it in a couple of weeks."
4,V2440 Food Saver,"This is easy!! The price and automatic features came together in a serenditous combination! Great machine, and a good move up for me. I replaced an older, manual model. This has the features that matched the way I work, without giving me built-in features I have no need for.My one complaint is that it did not come with a set of jar sealers, which I use to store grated cheese or cut onions.Bill"
5,Foodsaver V2440,"I got this item for half off at TGT, open box thing, but have an earlier Foodsaver unit, so have the hose and stuff. It seems to do a harder vacuum on the canisters, and the wider sealer strip is a plus, over the earlier unit. My humble opinion is that this is the Best Yet Vacuum'er sealer. I might add that this unit wastes more bag than the older model,due to the increased space between the vacuum trough and the heat strip, about 1/2 inch.UPDATE: 6/09 Still going strong, no problems. I use it several times every day. I always pre-freeze to avoid liquids entering the system, may help to extend life of the machine."
2,Longevity Not Good,"I expected it to last longer than a year and a half. Considering how much I paid for it, and considering the fact that I really didn't use it all that often, I don't believe I got my money's worth. I'm now going to try one of the cheap hand held models."
1,OMG!!! Do NOT Buy this item!!!!,"I have had a couple different versions of this 'type' of gadget over the past 10 years. 'THIS' particular one is THE WORST one I have EVER owned. It does not easily make bags, but most importantly ... IT DOES NOT SEAL ANYTHING!!! Only 2 times out the past 20 attempts was I able to actual seal something well enough to stick it in the freezer. When you have a problem and want to call the 800-people, better hope it happens during normal business hours ... the do NOT have after-hours help.This unit stinks ... DO NOT BUY IT. Wish I had an alternative solution. This one stinks. Stay away!"
1,No food saver No response from seller,"I attempted twice for the Seller to respond to when the item would ship. Nothing. Today was the last day for them to ship. No shipment. Claim is being filed. I recommend they be withdrawn from Amazon and I encourage everyone not to order from this company. This is the first ""bad"" experience I have had with Amazon.Very unhappy ripped off clientSherry"
4,No test leads & larger size than description,"The meter arrived without test leads in the box so I have to go thru the return/replace process. Description says the Product Dimensions are: 5 x 1.2 x 3.5 inches. The actual size is about 7.5"" long x 1.2"" thick x 3.5"" wide. With the protective boot on it, add another 0.5"" to all 3 dimensions. It is the same size as a Fluke 87. For reference the boot is PVC material and has a funny odor (not pleasant to me and different froma a Fluke 87 boot). The 4 star rating is for the functionality and price. Pretty awesome overall."
2,Bad Keys,"We bought this based on the reviews, but it isn't a very good trumpet. The case scratched easily, the springs on the keys are no good, and no matter how well we oil it, the keys continue to stick. It has a nice sound. We are going to attempt to get the springs replaced at a local shop to see if that fixes the problems we are having."
2,Not happy,"I am not happy with my experience with Austin Bazaar and the trumpet we purchased. We purchased this trumpet for my son's birthday. When we received the trumpet we found it to be defective. There was something wrong with the valves, they would keep sticking. We had to pay to send it back for a replacement. When we received the replacement it still had one valve that would stick. We sent it, through the school, to be fixed by the place that they send their instruments. The valve still sticks, obviously defective. And my son is so discouraged and frustrated. He hates to practice because he can't play right."
4,"Good for the Money, but be careful when using the oil","First let me say this trumpet is great for the price. If your child is a beginner and you want something you don't have to worry about it, this will fit the bill. However, if you are not sure how to oil the pistons, don't do what I did and take them out completely. It took me all night to get them back in the right way. In all fairness the company tells you not to, but I didn't think I was doing it right the way they told me to. My advice is to take it to a music store the first time and let them show you. Dealing with Austin Bazzar was very positive and would not hessitate to recommend them or use them again."
1,Reallly upset!,"I am so upset with this product! I bought this trumpet for my sons first year of band. After the first week of playing the band teacher realized that there was something wrong with my sons trumpet. The second valve was bent on the inside. So my son has missed many lessons due to the condition of this trumpet which will effect his band grade.I am afraid that this will kill his spirit for learning music. He is a straight A student, and now this is going to lower his GPA. All that I have to say is SHAME ON YOU austin bazaar! Oh also the teacher made the statement that the brass on the trumpet of the trumpet was so thin that she felt that I was had by the company! I am so unhappy because now I have to buy another trumpet. I would never recommend this copmany for the purchase of anything. I am so sick of you I don't know what to do!"
3,Not exactly what I expected,The House At The Edge Of the Park was extremely stupid and hard to sit through.The others were so-so. Think I'll give this DVD to a friend of mine for keeps.
2,You get what you pay for.,"These batteries are cheap, in every sense of the word. It isn't about how many batteries you get for your dollar; it's about how long your CD player will run on a dollar's worth of batteries. And in this case, the short battery life cancels out the low price per battery."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I have used 8 of the batteries so far. The first 4 were so weak that they would not power the toy I put them in. I tried 4 more from the opposite end of the bulk pack and they were OK. I don't know if the remaining batteries are OK but based on the initial 50% failure rate, I would definitely not buy this brand again."
2,Disapointed,"These were sent to my Grandchildren for their Christmas toys. My Daughter called to tell me that about 1/3 of them did not work. They wouldn't make the kids toys work. Don't try to save money, buy the more expensive one so the ALL work."
4,Good value for AA batteries,"Since various tests have found that all brands of normal AA batteries last roughly the same amount of time in normal devices, I decided to purchase this bulk pack of Ultralast batteries.They come in a large block of 40, but once you open the package, they're packaged in packs of 4. I have not yet had any problems whatsoever with these batteries. Considering they are significantly cheaper than the 'big brands,' I could probably still come out ahead even if it took two of these batteries to equate one 'big brand' battery.It's cheap and it works. What more could you ask for?"
3,"SILLY...YOU COULD DO THIS TO GORE .BUSH, CLINTON ETC",IF YOU CHOP UP DIALOGE YOU CAN MAKE ANYBODY SOUND STUPID. (NOT TO SAY THAT HE DIDN'T MAKE SOME ZINGER...BUT THEY ALL DO THAT) LOT'S OF QUAYLE QUOTE'S WEREN'T SAID.
5,Cool book!,"Diana is the daughter of wealthy Americans living in New Orleans in the early 1800s. Most of their neighbors are French Creoles. When the United States buys the Louisiana Purchase, New Orleans becomes an American City. Many of Diana's Creole neighbors are angry. But Diana has her own trouble. She must chosse between the two men that love her: a rich Creole and a young man in the Louis and Clark Expedition."
2,lemon,"Needle put out a tinny, hollow sound with flat bassFailed completely within a week of use. Previous needle of same type lasted ten years."
2,disappointed so far,"I just bought this sprayer, hoping it would cut down on hand pain from spraying my 40 rose brushes. It worked great at first, for about 2 minutes, then it stopped spraying and seemed to be unable to get the water to the nozzle. We rinsed and cleaned the parts, and changed to new batteries, but it only worked again for a minute and pooped out again. It may be a poor design or a bad motor. I will try again and see."
4,Good enough to buy again,"I bought one about a year ago and used it daily to spray water on my indoor mounted orchids - about 5 minutes of spraying per day. Sometimes I take it out to the greenhouse and use it for another 10 minutes. It suddenly quit working, but for the price, I don't expect it to last forever. I wish it worked with rechargeable batteries. I am going to order another one right now."
5,"Rob Lacey, great gift to us all","Great book that I ran across many years ago. Bought this copy to give away. As a pastor I'm always looking for new ways to build ""bridges"" to others. Not to change the message whatsoever, but sometimes changing the way it's delivered. End result still the same, more people committing their lives to Christ. A great tool and worth the investment"
3,"Great idea, kind of boring","I love the idea, but I only got about half-way through...lost interest in it quickly."
3,Unique,"Quite a unique paraphrase of the Holy Bible. Rob Lacey does do an excellent job at capturing the minds of post-moderns who may have never read the Bible or young adults who may have never understood the story of God. This gives a clear picture as to the story, just don't rely on it for the details."
4,bible with a small b,"The Word on the Street is a Paraphrase of the Big B. Lacey using lyrics, poems, and the written word, giving new understanding to some of the writings of The Bible. This is a great reference for helping those that are intimidated by the many versions of the Bible. One will laugh, one will cry, one may find new meaning and understanding. Give it a try!"
2,Mixed feelings,"Word on the Street is a big hearted, well meaning effort to make the Bible relevant and easy to understand for people of all walks of life. I give Rob Lacey credit for trying but this is just such a mess. I read five pages and began laughing. In order to simplify the Bible Word on the Street had to water down a lot. To me this Bible was like handing a starving person a bowl of popcorn because you figure that cutting into a steak is too much for him to handle.My bottom line on Word on the Street is this: It's an okay introduction for someone who wouldn't normally pick up a Bible but that's all it is."
1,A Warning to anyone who plans to buy this paraphrase:,"Should people add their thoughts to God's Word and create a paraphrase Bible?What does God's Word say?""Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.""PROVERBS 30:6On the last page of the Bible, from the book of Revelation, you read:18For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:19And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. Revelation 22:18-19God does not want us to mess with his word.Choose your path carefully!In Christ,Erin"
4,gripping,"Even though this work is considered historical fiction, the fictional part which is barely palpable only serves to enhance the originality of the story. Very few people know that Franco saved almost 60,000 Jews from the grip of the Nazis.I recommnmed it to historians as well as to the general reader."
5,"Satisfying, awesome stuff!",This deodorant smells great and functions just as it's supposed to. I think it's my favorite that I've tried so far...
3,Nothing can beat a tour guide,"This book was good as a general introduction to the trail and to get an idea of what to expect. However, while actually in Machu Picchu, nothing can beat a tour guide. More than half the book is dedicated to the trail and preparing for the hike, so if you have done this already or you are going with a group, this entire section will not be very helpful. The remainder of the book gives an average description of the site while leaving some serious gaps. Tour guides are great in this respect. The maps of the trail itself were a bit confusing and lacked detail. I would have preferred to buy another book on the subject. However, after looking at the books both in the states and while I was in Peru, I discovered that this is the best book out there - unfortunately. So if you want advance information on the trail and the ruins before you get there (and can get yourself a tour guide), buy this book. Just don't expect much."
2,Beware for the updates section,"I bought this book because of the maps and the information it gave as to how to be a good independent backpacker. If it were not for the hidden pages at the end of the book, I would give this book 10 stars. Hidden at the back of the book, you have an update section. This section mentions that independent backpacking is no longer allowed. The only thing usefull about the book now is its sections about lima and cuzco but if I wanted a normal guide book, I woul buy the Lonely Planet, not this one"
1,Worst purchase ever,"I frequently order items from Amazon and have never been disappointed--until now. The unit sent was obviously a return or display model. The surface is damaged in several locations, the packaging was taped together, and the bookshelf is barely stable. The return process is too problematic. So, I am stuck with a $100 pile of particle board."
5,I'm afraid (...that they've done it again),"I'm a huge fan of Converge. I own most of their discography that spans a decade. I fell in love with ""When Forever Comes Crashing"". This album, as expected, stunned me just as much.WFCC had a lot more low-end, and was darker. But that isn't to say Jane Doe is just as heavy. High-pitched screeches from singer Jake Bannon, and incredible skill displayed by the rest of the band at it's very best. Converge has changed, but not radically and certainly for the better! Complex guitar grooves, insane drumming, and even the occaisional background singing.Even the cd in it's physical form is beautiful - comes in a digi pack with a tinted jewel case, containing a thick booklet of the singer's artwork and the lyrics which are, as always, oustanding (if you can read the text). BUY THIS ALBUM AT ONCE."
5,A Review of Converge's Album - JANE DOE,"Can brutality be beautiful? Converge doesn't stammer to answer this question. Their response is an insanely fast and intense as hell conglomeration of metal, poetry, spirituality, and splendor. If music could somehow be an infusion of words, notes, and volatility, the end result for this band would seemingly be an incineration of sound. Converge has been together since late 1990 and within months of that, recorded their first demos. Ever since then, they've been putting out unyielding albums and don't show any signs of letting up. Sometimes dark, elegiac, cryptic, and despair-ridden, Converge writes some of the most eloquent tunes in music today. No stranger to addressing contemporary issues as well, they are one of the most underrated bands to grace this industry. Recommended Songs: ""Minnesota,"" ""My Unsaid Everything,"" ""Albatross,"" ""Heaven In Her Arms,"" and ""Concubine."""
5,As You Can See From the Other Reviews...,"This is the real deal. O where to begin. ""Jane Doe"" is easily the most innovative, complex, poetic, brutal, and flat out craziest album in heavy music today. No where will you hear anything similar to Converge's trademark sound.I can't even think of anything to write, it's beyond words you just have to experience it for yourself. If you have a taste for heavy music and/or a very musically open mind you will find yourself absolutely loving Converge. Guarantee it."
5,brilliance,"Greatest band ever here. Petitioning The Empty Sky is much better, but this is good stuff."
5,No words can't discrabe how good converge is,"I love converge's ""Jane doe"" i realy can't explain the feeling that i get when i listing to converge!!! Lets just say that i get inspire to actullie form a band ? Which i did and made my life 100 % better!!! Converge, candiria ,and, mudvayne are basically the main bands im focusing on right now... As i noticy the metal world grow and grow each day !!! rap fans and teeny poppers, step aside because its time for the hardcore/death/thrash/grind/blackmetal people to step in !!!Converge owns !!!"
2,From a Math Rock Perspective,"Intensity, check. Complexity, check. Songwriting. Songwriting come in....come in songwriting.... songwriting do you read me?"
1,You and your kind disgrace music.,All you little sad trend hopping morons call this music? This is noise pure and simple. I repeat this is not music. There is no deep musical complexity to this. There is no poetic meaning. This is filth and proves complete trash can be marketed to mindless drones who love nothing better to accept utter garbage as an art form. Why don't I just record loud static and give it a new age poetic name such as When The Skies Begin To Bleed. You'd probably buy it wouldn't you. Pathetic imbeciles. I hope your little hardcore scene dies an early death. It is molesting music by encouraging noise as an art form when it is just as listed: noise.
5,thaw out yees frickin contes,"nowa days metal seems to go one of two ways. you get your cool matal stretching from people such as tool through to paparoach-kerrang type bands.the other way is far darker-the seething underground.basically speaking if you are a spiritual mentalist then coverge will blow your mind.some compare converge to dillinger and technically the music is similar, but their tunes have a more emotional impact. FORMYSELF tracks 9 through to the secret track are the greatest moments in the world of music, ever. harsh and heavy, yet so thoroughly beautiful."
3,"Too much spiritual discussion, not enough how to's","The book spends too much time discussing, and refuting the stereotypes, and misconceptions relating to the locking process. It did not discuss the practical knowledge of how to start in enough depth. Additionally, the book assumes that anyone interested in locking has ""typical"" African American tightly coiled hair. Consequently it doesn't discuss how long it would take any different than typical hair to lock. This is a good book for anyone who has zero to little knowledge of locks and is exploring that alternative. For people who have already made the decision to lock, and just want practical information, Pamela Ferrell's book Lets Talk Hair, is a much better investment."
2,Don't stop here..,"If you are looking for help working your way through a new loc journey, (what to use, how to do it etc.) this book is not for you. If your doing research on the history of loc'd hair, with lots of personal convictions - this book is for you. If you have made the decision to loc your hair, you probably already have your own convictions - you don't need to buy them from a stranger. . I was so disappointed that with this book, I actually tossed it in the trash - something I almost never do."
1,Decieving title.,"The title of this book is very deceiving. The title says everything you need to know about african, dread and nubian locks. when in reality. it give very little information about the about. it gives mostly her personal beliefs nothing really concrete. I'm a african american Female who's made the decision to go natural for the the past year and half. and wanted to read something to help me make the decision of whether to do locks. this book was of no help to me. this is my personal evaluation. so if you are reading this and in my situation don't bother buying this book. it was of no help."
3,hairlocking everthing you need to know,it was okwanted to see more helpful products to use in my dreadlocsbut the information was helpful to me
3,Dread locks,"The book was okay, it took a couple of weeks to get to me and by that time I was not interested in it anymore"
5,"This book was insightful, inspirational, and up-lifting!","Nekhena Evans is paramount in her ability to communicate her message about not just hair locking, but also the historical, spiritual, and personal meanings as well. This book is a must if you are of African descent. This encourages me to drive on with my aid to increase black awareness in hair by developing AfricanHairCare.com"
4,good information about locks and various stages,I am a woman of African Descent. I really liked this book. I particularly liked the discussion on the different stages of hairlocking and hair growth. I have worn my hair natural for about 18 years and got locks about a year ago (May 2003). I read this book very quickly and refer to it often to remind myself to be patient with the process. I recommend the book.
5,Wow...simply wow,"I had a chance to see these two in visalia at a very small venue, it was extremely intimate, His vocals are hauntingly beautiful and he could really teach some of the up and comers something about meaningful songwriting. Do not pass them up if they come through your town, its quite an experience."
2,more radio edits from Robbins....,"Robbins is one of the leading names in dance music. But, just like their Best of Dance, Trance, and Divas series, this one includes mostly 3-4 minute radio edits with just one or two full length mixes. I actually LIKE that the songs are not segued together, but i think it would be better if Robbins released compilations with maybe a few less tracks, but with all the long versions. Also, note that this is really TRIBAL stuff, and not much in the way of vocals, if that's what you're looking for. So, anyway, the longest versions you get this time around are:Elements (Danny Tenaglia) (7:36) (album version, not the 12"")Feel This (Robbie Rivera) (7:51)Gia (DJ Gregory remix) (7:47)Drums Control (Richie Santana) (8:20)that's it. the rest are short versions."
3,Not as complete as I would have expected,"I am pretty well acquainted with Excel but the Pivot tables are probably THE MOST unexplained function in the prgm. The main problem is a thorough explanation as to the functioning of the 3 areas of the reports and what they actually report. Where to drop what and why without the insidious examples without being able to actually SEE the main worksheet to see where the data is coming from.I have tried 3 different books on Pivot Tables and each one gives some but not all, I usually have to refer to all 3 to finally get an answer.Still, even with all three, trial and error has become the norm."
1,Without examples,A reviewer gives 2 points and that is the maximun for this book. You don't find practicals examples in this book. Search another book.
2,Where's the DATA?,"I just got this book recently and started it today. It seems well written. As soon as I started, I asked ""Doesn't this come with a CD?"" Apparently not. Then the data to work with must be online. Right? I can't find it. How the heck am I supposed to learn this stuff without seeing the effects of my data entry, mouse clicks, errors, etc? Will Amazon take this back after I've started reading it?If there really are worksheets somewhere to work on, somebody please tell me, else I stick with 2 stars which seems kind of generous."
5,Pivot Table Data Crunching,The book arrived in great conditon for a used book. It was actually brand new for a fifth of what a new one cost. I have taken it to work to share. Thanks Lov'in it
5,A long time comin!,"I have been looking for a book on Pivot Tables for along time, and I luckily stumbled across this one. I couldn't be happier. It's got tons of clear and examples that have given me lots of ""ah ha!"" moments. No matter what your level of Excel experience,this stuff is invaluable if you work with lots of data. Although it's specific to one area of Excel, this is my choice for the best Excel book this year."
1,It tastes stale,"We could not eat this product because it tasted really old and outdated. I checked the package for an expiration date, and it had something stamped on the box, but I could not read it. Very disappointed with this product and I will have to throw the remaining boxes away."
4,Let's make some noise!,"""I Make Music,"" by Eloise Greenfield, is illustrated by Jan Spivey Gilchrist. The text is a simple poem, told in the 1st person by a child character. The narrator expresses her joy at making music in a variety of ways: playing a toy xylophone, simply slapping her thigh, and more. Sample text: ""I make good music/ on my drums,/ I make good music/ with my thumbs."" The bright, colorful artwork is effective although not especially outstanding. Overall, a fun book."
2,"Don't know if they work, but they taste awful!","My sister, an elementary school teacher, recommended this product. I thought the tablets sounded better than the nasal mist or swabs, so I opted for these. I can't tell you if they work, because I only took two, actually not even two, because I had to spit the second one out. I thought they were the worst things ever! Plus, you're not supposed to drink or eat for 15 minutes after, so you can't get the taste out of your mouth. Very bitter. I now have the nasal mist, which seems better, and Airborne liquid, which I'm am hoping will help me fight the cold that everyone in my office seems to have!"
5,At last! At last!,"I've been hitting the music sites for years hoping the Holy Modal Rounders would finally surface on cd. I was first infected with their music in college, where they quickly took over my dorm. It's foot-tapping, squeaky and whimsical and soon you'll know all the words (I had 'Euphoria' played at my wedding). My cd classics collection is now complete."
4,"Not exactly addicted to it, but it's strangely amusing","This is the weirdest music you've probably never heard of. Having said that, if you pick this album up, expect to be oddly intrigued by this unlikely duo of bluegrass maestros. They basically take bluegrass standards, apply some LSD to them, and voila! you have acid bluegrass...strange stuff, but fun."
5,Another example of pointless editing,"This is a highly welcome reissue, but who decided to trim off Weber saying ""Long road a-winding to the land of my dreams"" at the beginning of ""Long John."" And for god's sake: WHY?Still a great record, especially HMR 1, with Weber in especially fine form and the song choices primo."
2,Completly messy book without explaining deeply (ie MAPI).,"Being new in the programming in Windows (experience in C++) and looking to the contents of this book I thought it is a good book for beginning programming VC++. After studying parts of this book I can say that I got an idea and nothing more.The first part of the book is explaining the Visual C++ Development System. VERY BAD. The second part is about Windows Architecture. Here I can say that I got an idea about the threats, processes but nothing deep. In the MFC part I was completly lost.In the chapter of MAPI it is explained only the Simple MAPI. (buy ""Inside MAPI"" from Microsoft Press).Viktor Toth (author) could have written in his book fewer topics but with better explanations."
4,Good Reference,"A good Visual C++ reference, covers all mfc classes and vc 5 wizards, but lacks of information regarding to the use of visual components from vc. Not recomended for beginners."
3,"Good book, lousy product","I really like the book, the author has done a great job, but the book was in poor condition (highlighted way more than anticipated...poor product description)"
5,Perfect Value,"These tuners are probably the nicest locking tuners I've ever installed on a guitar. (I've installed Sperzel, Planet Waves Trim-loks, and these bad boys)Not only are they absolutely simple to install, they look classy with the frosted chrome and mirrored chrome accenting each other.In terms of performance, they do exacty what you expect. They make stringing the guitar simple and fast, while providing tuning stability like no other. Don't be afraid of whammy bar use when these guys are installed.Absolutely flawless locking tuners."
5,Drop in replacement on MIM Strats,I ordered a couple of sets of these for 2001 and 2011 MIM Strats that I have and they were a drop in replacement that installed in about 10 minutes. I didn't have tuning problems on either of my Strats but wanted these tuners for the ease of changing strings.The tuners work exactly as they should. I had read that locking tuners will add a lot of weight to the neck and possibly throw off the balance. I weighed the old ones that came out and these tuners and the increase in weight is 7.2 grams (1/4 ounce). That is slightly less than the weight of a quarter and a dime so if you are concerned about the weight you could tape a quarter and a dime to your headstock and see if you even notice the difference. I can't notice it.The 2 sets I got were made in Taiwan.
4,"Good quality, you may need tools and skills","Out of the package the tuners seem to be of a very good quality. Nice and tight, finish was perfect. Be aware 3 of these are shorter for the top three strings. A few things you should be aware of: This is a replacement for Fender guitars. I do believe these to be very good quality tuners. The rest of the review I will explain my experience and perhaps help others make a choice. I was replacing the junky tuners on a 91 peavey predator, and I had to do a lot of drilling. You may need to have some patience and decent skills if you are putting these on another brand of guitar. I found a link on the net for installation tips and it really helped. In the end I had to return them because my headstock was apparently thicker than a Fender headstock, and the shorter tuner axles were so short (1/8"") you couldn't put strings on. So like I say, its a pretty good product, but be aware they may not work on your off brand guitar."
1,Garbage,"I bought these, and although they look very nice, two of them came defective, and that is unacceptable. The string capturing shafts slid out of the base. Not the solid sound I was looking for."
1,"Not at all comparable to Schaller tuners. Cheap, poor build quality!","I bought a set of these hoping to upgrade a tele with tuners that have gotten a bit tight over the years. I own a couple American Deluxe strats with locking tuners on them, the ones made by Schaller. They look very similiar but the build quality is VERY poor. I could actually see the shaft rocking back and forth on one of them. None of them really had a smooth mechanical feel. I am returning my set. I'm sure they work fine for those upgrading a MIM or very cheap tuners, but these are not much of an improvement over budget tuners. I was expecting a pretty decent set of tuners for the price. Dont waste your time with these ... Buy the real Fender Schaller tuners and save yourself some trouble."
5,The solution for tremolo bar equipped guitars.,"My Stratocaster wouldn't stay in tune if I so much as sneezed at the tremolo bar until I installed these. Now, I can recklessly dive-bomb my tremolo and it returns to perfect pitch EVERY time. I can't comment on how they compare to other locking tuners, but I can say that they're of excellent quality."
3,frustrated!?,"I bought these tuners hoping that I would get better tuning stability. I have a MIM strat, so the swap was easy. I just came from a 3hour practice & I was constantly re-tuning my guitar. The tuners I had on there were not that bad. I got these hoping that I would hardly have to re-tune. I think I tuned less w/the tuners already on there. Why did I pay $45 for tuners that are no better than the ones I had on there? Anyone have this same problem?Im still frustrated that I paid for tuners not much better than what I had. Good tuning is all in the way you wrap them. I now wrap them like they were not locking timers, except I still tighten that wheel on the back. They do hold a good tune just not much better than I already had. Save your money and just learn to wrap your strings better(IMO). They do look nice, feel solid, and tune good. Use your money for a nice pedal or cable."
3,"If they're fender, they should fit guitars made by fender",Good quality construction and they look nice. But to fit them to the squier bullet strat i bought them for I would have to drill bigger holes for the posts and two small holes for each tuning machine to stabilize it. Not what I was expecting.
5,Great,"The 1st Maroon 5 single released state-side combines grit, rock, and pop, with an underlying theme that revenge is sweet (""Does it kill? Does it burn? Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control? Does it thrill? Does it sting when you feel what I bring, and you wish that you had me to hold?""). The music itself is fabulous, paired with the lead singer's sultry voice, it's never a miss! Other songs on the full album are great too, check it out!"
3,Romancy Politics,"I bought this book at an antique show because I'd been reading Robert Jordan. ""Messalina"" is the mythic root of one his characters in the Wheel of Time series, Mesaanna, of the Forsaken. This book portrays her as a powerful, vindictive woman in ancient Rome, but ultimately leaves much to be desired. Based on the culture of Rome itself, Messalina didn't have many options open to her, and she is more a tragic heroine shaped by her culture than a true villainess.While the story itself was average, I was pleased with the character insights I gleaned.From the back of the book:""From the moment of her first experience, she used her body uninhibitedly in the game of power politics. Nothing in the realm of passion was beyond her knowledge. She became the most powerful woman in Rome.""Here is her story, the story of one of history's most fascinating females -- of the countless men she destroyed, and the one man she could not destroy."""
5,Very Good BUY,"check it out ~ i'm a combat medic currently deployed to Baghdad IRAQ....i bought this book to further my knowledge in the medical field....its light weight, easy to carry around and very informative! the cd rom also comes with pictures and small video clips of various tasks. all together this is one of the best medical books i've seen! ~91w10 USARMY"
5,An excellent overview of handpaperpmaking -A must-have,"Excellent, information packed, a good reference as well as how-to book, belongs in every collection, lots of images of artists' work. I return to it for moldmaking for casting paper."
5,IT'S HERE! IT'S HERE! Finally,"I have continue to check this site time and time again to see when and where the 5th Season of the Jeffersons were ever coming out. I was starting to worry. I have all four seasons and have enjoyed them so much. People don't understand that these shows are priceless. Thank Goodness they have the 5th season available and once I purchase this, I will be on the lookout for the 6th season. KEEP THEM COMING AMAZON! I love, love , love the Jeffersons!"
5,THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE ON UP... IS TO KEEP MOVING ON UP WITH THE FIFTH SEASON OF THE JEFFERSONS,"WOW... MY FRIENDS. THE JEFFERSONS: THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON. I WAS GETTING WORRIED ABOUT THE FIFTH SEASON RELEASE FOR QUITE AWHILE. BUT NEVER THE LESS, THE JEFFERSONS: THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON WILL BE RELEASED ON August 15th, 2006. AND AS ALWAYS I WILL BE ORDERING IMMEDIATELY."
5,Great Old Times,"What can't you say about the Jefferson's (George & Weezy)? Here we are some 30 years later and this sitcom still makes you laugh just as hard. I love the Jeffersons, I would rather watch old classics like this rather than watch the junk that is now on television. Television has really gone downhill!"
1,"Aside from the maps, this book was worthless.","This could hardly be considered an objective look at Israel's wars over the years and strategies for defense in the future, although that is how it is billed. It is highly subjective, written from an atheistic and far left-wing perspective with constant jabs at actions of the Israeli right as well as Israel's religious Jews.While a few of the ideas presented in the book were worth some consideration, it suffers greatly due to the decided slant in the style of writing. Contrary to the above review, this book has had little, if any, impact on Israeli politics, as very few Israeli politicians could take this book seriously due to the level of moral relativism present throughout the text. To assert that this book had anything to do with the wall along the green line is absurd.For a objective look at Israel's wars and modern Israeli politics written from a moral, yet centrist, perspective, readRight to Exist: A Moral Defense of Israel's Wars."
2,Dubious recommendations,"Van Creveld does point out the problems Israel faces: terror, conventional attacks, and possible long-term hostility and threats no matter what it does. And he has a solution: reduce the threat of terror by getting out of the land that was under Arab occupation in 1966.Unfortunately, the argument for doing this is unconvincing. And there are some strong arguments for doing something else. One is that ethnically cleansing the West Bank of its Jews is already a serious abrogation of human rights. Another is that it may well encourage Arab terror even more if the interim result of it is to gain general acceptance of Arab rights to steal Jewish land. I was not impressed by the author's grasp of such problems. Van Creveld may be correct that a fence separating the Jews and Arabs is a good idea. But there is no good reason to put even the heavily Jewish portions of the West Bank on the Arab side of the fence even when these areas are adjacent to the 1966 Israeli border."
4,Shipping,"The case was broken in several pieces when i received it ,The case is part of the stone holder as you sharpen your knives, they need to to ship this item with more packing ,Now i have to go through the the hassle of sending it back and wait for a new one."
3,Good comprehensive backup; Finicky and Difficult to Learn,"On the surface Retrospect appears very easy to use. Start using it and it is much harder. There are a few different procedures to follow to do a good backup, and while it has a wizard, the wizard does not warn you of certain things. For example, you want to use ""Duplicate"" rather than ""Backup"" because you will get complete files in your backup. It does come with a very comprehensive manual, and I will admit to not reading the whole darn thing. Once you get it going, it will do everything you need it to, and quickly. It's been good for my small business and home use. I recommend it because I have not found anything better. But study it, and call tech support if needed. They were pretty good."
5,Technical but reliable,This company has a great product. The steps you use are unique from others and therefore some feel it should not be used by the majority. I am of the opinion let the manufactuer spend their time making a reliable product and I'll spend my time learning to make it work. File and Directory selection were the most confusing steps for me because Retro does it differently but once I understood it was a breeze. For me the wizard made it hard to understand but when I went to advanced mode then it all became clear.Certainly not for the New Kid on the Block but experienced file manipulators should not shy away from this product.
4,"Retrospect: learning hurdles, yes -- but very reliable once you understand","Reading through these reviews and comments, I have to agree that Retrospect's interface has always marched to it's own drummer. When I first stomped my way through an old Mac version back in 1994, I used it to do basic one-off backups but didn't understand it well.Over time and several versions, on both Macs (desktops and servers) and Windows (desktops and servers), it's a tool that I regularly count on for reliability and redunancy. I have client sites where I can easily roll back to any date in the last 6 months and pull a single misplaced file or an entire disk.Like any backup regimen, it requires that you think about how you want to use the product (number of backup sets and disk sets) and how your users should be protected. A little seasoning (and reading the manual) pays big dividends!--Gary SzaboPrincipal, Mindful Technologies"
3,"OK, with limitations","Needing backup software that would run under windows XP.I looked, & Retrospect seemed the best. There was nothing that approached the convenience of Apple's Time Machine. Nuff said.Installation was easy. Trying to figure out all the options was a bit tiresome. The manual is huge & there are lots of options. I did manage to create a backup OK on my Time Capsule network drive; Rendevous is not sufficient, the solution was to install Apple's ""Airport utility for PCs"" -- A free download. That's no criticism of Retrospect. The only thing I disliked about Retrospect was I couldn't create a disaster CD (the image is too big to fit).I bought some DVD R+ & that worked fine. I haven't tried to do a recovery yet, but I sleep better. They do warn you (me) that recovering a backup after a disaster is difficult from a network drive (there's no driver on the disaster recovery disk). I'll cross that bridge when I have to."
1,Cryptic interface is inflexible,"This software is cryptic and counter-intuitive. When duplicating (syncronizing) my server's data hard drive onto my portable hard drive, I would like to exclude specific folder groups, but this doesn't seem to work. I finally resorted to just copying selected data onto the portable drive, then tried to duplicate the server data again after making some changes to files on my server's drive. This resulted in deletion of the entire contents of my portable hard drive! This software should have a selection window similar to Windows XP Backup where you can select/unselect specific folders. This was a waste of money. I am an engineer, used to working with various software functions. This type of software should have a simple intuitive interface but it doesn't."
1,"Run, don't walk, away from Retrospect Backup","Retrospect is a terrible software application for the ordinary Windows or Mac user. Both versions are complex and difficult to use, and the interfaces are extremely unintuitive. To make matters worse, EMC will want to charge you $69 if you need help with this indecipherable mess. I only hope that the Time Machine backup feature that debuts with Mac's Leopard version of OS X will finally put this product out of business."
1,A Steaming Pile of Dung,"I too used Retrospect on the Mac and expected great things. I could be wrong, I'm using Retrospect Express which was bundled along with a nice NAS drive I bought. The drive is quiet, dependable and lovely. Retrospect Express stinketh. I'm a retired computer professional, and were it not for my expertise I wouldn't have been able to complete the most basic tasks. Stay far away. Any company which would release Retrospect Express on the public should not be trusted, even with this paid for version. Someone must be making something better."
5,agile / LEAN,"this book is well written and presents plenty of reasons why ""Agile"" can be done with an emphasis on managing work in process rather than focusing management of the SDLC on people, time, and sprints."
2,Unimpressed,I found nothing concrete or useful in this book. It is loaded with interesting anecdotes but they're vague with regard to execution and follow through. The success stories generally end with the release date. Never mind the poor slobs who had to maintain whatever was slapped together at the last minute.
5,Excellent Greatest Hits CD!,"This CD is a must for any longtime fan of POOH or if you just want to purchase 1 CD of the band. The selection of songs is fantastic, the CD covers all the #1 hits throughout their career plus the best songs they have ever written. The songs are remastered so they sound incredible and there are 2 new songs ""E Arrivi Tu"" and ""Figli"". A must buy!"
4,What a great band.,"I saw these guys open for Placebo. Since then, they have easily become my favorite band. The CD is also great. They mix crunching guitar riffs with beautiful melodies and a gorgeous angelic voice. I really enjoy this band."
5,Don't Miss Out!,"This is electronic pop at its best. Although the word ""pop"" does not do it justice; ""rock"" is the better word. Imagine GARBAGE with more of an edge. For those of you within driving distance of Metro Detroit I recommend seeing them live. The rest of you should grab the CD. A major label should grab them up quick."
5,Candycane POP,"The name steers you into thinking they are more hardcore than they appear. Deathgirl.com is one of Detroit's hidden gems yet to be discovered. The album is power packed with swift and solid pop cords and lyrics that are familiar to keep humming after a first time listen.... For a debut album this album keeps you wanting to hear tune after tune. Best listens: Pieces, Look at me. Reference to: Poe, Lush, Garbage."
2,Pretty ok,"This self-titled CD offering from Deathgirl is pretty average. Recycled loops and guitars give way to inspiring but sometimes whiney vocals. Good production throughout, although the songwriting leaves much to be desired. Not major label material, but good for an indie act. -Leroy Steinberg"
4,Buck Knife,"Very nice working knife. This is not a show knife, it's a well put together tool that you'll use without fear of scratching it. I bought one for myself and two as gifts."
3,It took 3 reads,It is not very well written. Repetitive. It had some interesting stories and I did re-read it... and will do so again.
2,"Biased, disjointed attempt at non-fiction","Wow! Is LaVigne for real? I have read a couple of his books on the Hells Angels MC and they are nothing more than his personal diatribe on the evils of bikers in general. He really seems to have a particular hatred for the Hells Angels, though-is he jealous?-but he does devote a chapter to each of the ""big four"": the Hells Angels, the Pagans, the Bandidos & the Outlaws. This book is a little fact mixed with a lot of crass fiction. LaVigne obviously thinks talking dirty will make him more believable. Ridiculous stuff!"
3,Yves. Again!,"This is sort of a weird book. Yves starts the book writing in the style of a wannabe Hunter S. Thompson and then decides that he may as well just start ""writing"". I would say that the abrupt transition starts in maybe the first 80 pages.I believe that Yves Lavigne is probably the most knowledgeable author in the world about the major motorcycle clubs, other than insiders like Barger (or even Wethern) or undercovers like Queen or Dobyns (through authors), or in-touch contacts like Thompson.But Yves has some sort of agenda that makes him report every myth and fantasy that has EVER been posited as if it is a FACT. It doesn't take long to tire of this book if you have read everything else, because you have to believe, based upon acquired knowledge, that 30% of what he says is suspect, at best.I respect Lavigne for his obviously superior knowledge of the topic as a whole. But read every other account and determine for yourself if he has some personal agenda, even if it is as simple as money."
1,Is this for real?,"Reading this book is like watching ""Reefer Madness""Most of the paragraphs start with: The Hell's Angels... or The Angels...So many phrases are repeated again and again and again. I am amazed anyone can take this book seriously. Poorly written, poorly researched and a huge waste of time, namely mine for reading this crap."
5,"Buy It, and Read It Today!","A very good read, and I highly recommend it to anyone researching MC's.Riley GInternational PresidentBlood Brothers MC"
2,A biased and distorted view,"The author gets his information from informants and cops who want to justify and glorify themselves at the expense of the number one motorcycle organization in the world. It is full of half truths and lies and slanted viewpoints. If the author had the fortitude to hang out with the people whose names he trashes, he would develop a respect and affection for some really fine and fun people. I know. I did."
5,Excellent!!,The author pulls no punches(just as the subjects of the book would'nt)in describing the inner-workings and lifestyle of the most infamous motorcycle gang in history
4,Good book but very one-sided,A good in-depth look at 1% ers but very one -sided and anti Hells Angels. Most of the information in the book comes from rat informants who committed worse crimes than those discussed and from police who know nothing of the club. If they did the Angels might not still be around. As a Red and White supporter I know that not all Angels are saints but then neither are the police that chase them. Support Your Local 81!!!
1,"When in doubt, knock Yves out.","The only thing this book is good for, is stuffing a piñata for your kids birthday party."
2,Three can read the book if two can stay awake,"This book is poorly written. While the information is interesting, it is dated and extremely hard to follow at times. It reads like a rough draft of ideas. The information in the book is very out of date to say the least. If all one wants to do is look into the history of the club, this might be a good book if it were written with more professionalism. The way that it is written now, it has few redeeming qualities. One would have to read certain pages several times to try and understand what the author was trying to convey. Over all, it is dated and very difficult to follow even for a biker who understands what the author is writing about."
5,One of the best books written about the modern 1% lifestyle!,"If you're interested in outlaw bikers, this is one of the most comprehensive books written since Hunter Thompson's HELLS ANGELS. It provides a clear understanding of what took the outlaw clubs from being about riding, fighting and women to being primarily focused on earning money and fighting the RICO laws. In addition to great background info on the Angels, there's hard to find history on the other three of the ""Big Four"" clubs. Although a lot of the book focuses on Canada, it's a great read and a must have for anyone interested in the outlaw biker subculture."
3,"Crudity aside, a good documentary","Yves Lavigne's unrelenting vulgarity takes away from what is otherwise an informative and well researched first-person account of the growth of the Hell's Angels growth from 50's rebels to 60's cause celebre to modern day mafia. Their ability to enforce omerta (the code of silence)among their members, at least in this account, makes them more effective, and more dangerous, than La Cosa Nostra. How much of this admittedly entertaining tale is truth and how much is fantasy? Only Mr. Lavigne and the Hell's Angels know with any certainty."
1,Repeat?,"If you read Taking Care of Business don't waste your money on this one. There is a little bit of new stuff but in large it is a repeat of TOB. Opinions, everybody has one..."
3,Great for fans of the Aquabats,"If you are a fan of the Aquabats since the early days, you will love this. If not, it might get a little boring."
3,Big let down,"I was excited about getting this dvd because I had heard that the aquabats were really awesome. So when I got it I popped it in and started watching the live show. I was blown away! I couldn't believe that they would put that concert on their bands dvd, the sound quality during the whole show is horrible, the concert is somewhat lame, in part because the kids are stage diving the whole time, even when there is no music and the powdered milk man has some kind of trouble and they don't light him on fire, (though at the end the band partakes in some finger warming fun) and the stage is so small they don't all fit up there.I would recommend this dvd for the special features, which is basically extra performances that are really good. the sound quality is better as the shows are. All in all I wasn't pleased with the live show, but disk two was good. Hope this helps"
5,AMAZING!,"this band is truly the most fun band to see live and if you haven't seen them I highly recommend you do. you can't leave a show of theres unhappy, they are just amazing!"
5,Thrilled,I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She is a superfan and has turned me on to The Aquabats. We watched a lot of this together and it is the ultimate DVD for hardcore fans.
5,A MEMORABLE BOOK,"This exceptional book is well-written with excellent character development. In addition, the unusual plot puts it in the ""I couldn't put it down"" category. kirsten's observations and insights relating to the culture of the black race in Boston and Jamaica and London's off-beat night life are detailed and profound and will interest any reader. I highly recommend it."
1,Compass Wasn't Functional,"I purchased this compass for hiking/mushroom gathering. It was received in good time. However, the compass would not move properly. It would only work if it was turned upside down, then would stick again.I contacted the company and told them the compass did not work, and they never got back to me.Phooey!"
5,The Bible for Forms Design!,"Nygren's book tells how to put together a form from beginning to end. Granted the book is a few decades old, but once you have a grasp of the concepts, it becomes logical to understand.A must have for any form or interface designer."
4,Something else!!,"This was a great book!!i think it is so great that stevie got the assignment on the marraige thing!! the only thing that could have been different was that i think Callie should have a boyfriend -since they say she is so Hot!- and the guy she was paired up with was realy perfect!!To change the subject,i think that George is totaly gross and the perfect NERD!!But i wish that Callie would just tell him off once and for all!!To put it in a nutshell I think bonnie is a real good writer and should keep it up!! ((((and i think Lisa should go out with Scott))))"
2,annoying,"I, too, wish the author would tell us what Carole's PSAT score was. If it's that important to the book, we should at least get a rough number. It was hard to believe, too, especially since Carole scored higher than Lisa. That seemed impossible considering how much effort Lisa puts into her schoolwork.Anyway, Stevie has become a school reporter and is profiling a ""marriage"" project the class is doing. She is going to focus on herself, her friend Callie, and Veronica diAngelo, who isn't happy with either her partner or Stevie interviewing her."
5,Great buy for my HP 695C.,"The printer came professionally packed. It included the power cord. Plugged it in, installed the ink and it worked perfect first time."
4,Hot Spot Foam Worked,This foam reduced the hot spots on my Golden Retriever. She went from constantly scratching to very infrequently scratching the hot spots.
5,Endless fun,"I got this for my friend's 16 year old son and he LOVES it! He is so excited about just knowing how all these things work, even though his mother refuses to let him into a Radio Shack in case he tries to build some of it! I've made him promise not to use any of his evil knowledge against our family and in return, I'll get him book 2 for his birthday! Great fun!"
5,GREAT BOOK!!,Great book most of the projects cost under $30 (which would have been nice to know before I bought the book cuz I'm BROKE :( )also do not buy this book if you do not own a soldering iron or have a bad education with electronics But anyways Great Book and detailed instructions that even I can follow ;)
1,Unhappy,I bought this book thinking I would learn something everything inside this is VERY OUTDATED warning this book is a waste of money. Avoid at all cost.
3,Evil genius spy gaget review,"Some very intresting projects, however be prepared to get sucked in as equipment and background knowledge in electronics is a must. There is a distinct difference between the evil genius books in the way they are written in terms of assumption of knowledge. This particular edition requires the reader to have an In depth understanding of schematics."
5,Thanks for your comments and support,Just a quick thank you from Brad and I for the wonderful contributions many of you have made here and on our Support Forum at www.atomiczombie.com . Glad that you are enjoying this book. It was ALOT of work. Rumor has it another Spy Gadgets book will be out in late 2008. Stay tuned for more details and announcements.
4,"Fun Book, Beware Of Typos","This is a fun book, with lots of great ideas. However, it really needed tighter editing. There are several instances where the text did not agree with the schematics (schematic has 50K ohm pot, text discusses 50 ohm, etc). This is unfortunate, since novice readers may not spot the problems, and end up with circuits which don't work.I'd also recommend a more traditional, left-to-right layout of the schematics. Some are left-right top-down, others are right-left. This makes it more difficult to follow the ""flow"" through the circuits.Regardless of these hiccups, I'd recommend this book to those who'd like to tinker with ""spy gear"" or who are looking for simplier project ideas."
3,O.K - would not buy it again if I lost the CD,"This is a decent album not one you want to hear over and over.The singer has definitely gotten better from the earlier Europe days, and the sound of the band is a lot more metal."
5,"Running against the line, against the time...","Yeah, people... stop bitching about Europe not playing 80's style anymore... this is the new era and their new sound. This album follows START FROM THE DARK and keeps its mood and attitude. John Norum has created a collection of great riffs, Joey Tempest sings from his soul, good lyrics make a solid album. Love the title track, Always the Pretenders, Let the Children Play, The Getaway Plan and Forever Traveling, to name a few. The guys are still rocking, period."
4,always the pretenders....i.e. Europe rocks!,"Great hard rock... Those who criticize this album or give it bad marks are likely from the competition or fooling around. Any band would wish to have this CD under their belt.It is similar to 'Start from the Dark' and as some have said, 'Secret Society' has a different yet modern sound.Compared to other bands from this genre, Europe eats them all for breakfast. A Mothers Son is a wonderful track together with Always the Pretenders.Worth the buck. Rock on Europe!"
5,"What to say, hmmm?","It's fantastic and don't expect any 80's drivel here (hey I love the 80's).This album is so good that I would say it's up there with Wings of Tomorrow (of course nothing can beat WOT).Wow, BUY IT NOW!!!!!! FIVE BIG STARS, can I put 10? :)"
3,Europe or John Norum?,"I have loved Europe for over 20 years, but this new album is less than impressive. It sounds more like a John Norum album with Joey Tempest making a half-hearted attempt at the vocals. Some of the lyrics are awkward and forced. It feels almost unfinished. I expected better."
4,in case you were wondering what the heck this was...,"this is a DVD of Hellogoodbye, recently featured on The Real World. DVD includes music videos, live footage, backstage footage, an acoustic performance, and 'making of' footage from their music videos.haven't seen it yet but plan on getting it. They're a pretty awesome band."
3,A glorious trainwreck,"This review is tough express. I'm not sure of the source tape quality etcso I have heard better mixes and releases of far better quality. Ronnie and Keith did sound ripped, but it was a time of rock and roll excess. Are there missed notes and chords, is it sloppy? YES.But man it rocks it has a certain dirty groove and energy that will make you turn up the volume and stomp.Pure rock and roll sometimes is not pretty and this is a fine example.If you love your rock down and dirty or better stated ""solid garage rock"" This will put a smile on your face. If you love perfection all the way around pass on it. I love the music but to keep it real I give it 3 stars for the flaws....Yes it's glorious trainwreck."
5,Loose and FANTASTIC!!,"These guys rocked the Oakland Coliseum when I saw them swing through the bay area back in the 70s. Keith and Ronnie were so elegantly wasted cool. Sharing a mic on Honky Tonk Women, Ronnie would approach the mic with cigarette in mouth and then quickly take it out and put it at the foot of the mic stand. Keith would sidle up and drop down and in a flash would have that cigarette in his mouth, both of them smiling in agreement that this stage is where it's at. And Stanley Clarke playing an out of this world bass solo with Ziggy pounding out a funky beat! If this double CD set is the only live chronicle of this band having a blast, then it's totally worth owning. Great that this gig is officially released. Ian MacLagan's ""Troublemaker"" CD uses the same musicians in the studio. His voice has that same raspiness of Ronnie's voice. Rock n'Roll!"
2,DON'T - BLEEP! - YOUR MONEY AWAY AS I DID,"Despite just loving the song, ""Stay With Me,"" I only hope that I'm permitted to live long enough to know of someone going up to Ron Wood, taking his guitar away from him (hopefully by force) and saying, ""Now, Woody, you jus' go'n grow some mold or something."" This thing is EL-SUCKO. True, I will purchase most anything that has Keith Richards on it - WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT GUNK W/""U2"" - and, as a pretty decent bass player myself, it is my humble opinion that Stanley Clarke is second ONLY to Jaco. But even THEIR presense makes one opine, ""They don't contribute enuf to this thing t' make it worth it, the effort involved in just drowning out the unmitigated noise that R Wood regurgitates on this thing."" Said it before, and I'll say it again: KEEF NEEDS A >BLONDE< GUITARIST to bounce off of and work with: dig - Brian Jones...Mick Taylor...and ""recently,"" Wino-Waddy Wachtel."
5,Nice fine granules to smoothe your skin.,I really like this product. I have used apricot scrub and a few others that have either huge granules that are too rough or granules that dissolve and don't do much(lancome). I'm happy with this scrub. I have sensitive skin and use this about 3 times a week without any irritation.
2,battery charger,Did not work when received. front panel poorly assembled and loose. I would look at other battery chargers before buying this one.
3,Worked great for a while,"After a couple years of use in weather, it's flaky.Only works if I flip the switches and unplug a couple times."
5,Good Charger,"This charger is a steel cased one and the brand name is well known for quality. It is my second Schumacher over 20 years. My old one still does a good job also, I just needed to have (2) of them. The price is fair also."
4,So far so good,"I have used this charger a couple of times ,and it has worked OK so far.I do prefer the manual setting and my old Schumacher charger which still works has both automatic and manual settings.However the manuals settings to me seem to offer the best options,so I purchased this newer charger as a backup as I have several automobiles and have to charge them up occationally.I will note that a new Schumacher Model SE=2150MA brand new out of the box failed the first time I used it and Schumacher told me that if it was going to cost me $35.00 or more to repair it would not be worth repairing.I will admit that it hurts to see a brand new charger look so imaculate not being able to work,as I still cannot find the heart to throw it away."
1,Poor product,"Won't even charge a 4 wheeler battery much less a car. Was and is totally useless. Don't buy this unless you have a good battery, cause it will do nothing for the battery!"
4,Your basic battery charger,"I picked this charger up for a car that only gets out of the garage five or six times a year. It has been used on a Odyssey red top battery repeatedly on the low/trickle charge setting to get the battery back up after sitting dead for a couple weeks and I had no issues in charging. My two small complaints are I wish the cables were a bit longer and the case was a little better built. The case ""feels"" a bit flimsy, although to date I've had no issues with it."
1,I am very disappointed,"Not only can I not review this product I never even received it!!! I expected better from Amazon & the people it does business with. I am also very unhappy with the lack of recourse to resolve this issue, despite several attempts to contact the seller and Amazon this is the first time I have heard anything."
4,Interesting South Atlantic,"This is not a chart to navigate by, but it provides information that most people never heard of. Schoolers think of Drake, for example, almost always in terms of the colonies and the UK. There's more to it. Great gift for the young historian."
4,The Drake Passage Chart,"The chart is very extensive with much detail. If you are planning a trip out of Ushuaia, Argentina this will be handy to have."
3,okay book,"not sure if there are two editions of the book, being that there appear two different covers... one with the mountain and the other with the flowers. i gave this book a three-stars because in this day and age i was expecting color photos. the kicker was that the color plates of this book was inserted upside down and needed to turn the book upside down to read. the book is more of a reading book than an identification field book."
1,Bad Quality,"A great book on herbal medicine by Michael Moore. However, I returned the book because of pages falling out of a new book. Others have had a similar problem with this book. I purchased a different copy released by different printers."
3,Medicinal Plants of the Desert and Canyon West,"Very descriptive and well illustrated book. Like that it has collection, preperation and side effects information. Only downside is the center photo section is inserted into the book upside-down."
3,toaster oven,"I bought this to replace one that finally wore out. If you are going to use this only as a toaster, I would suggest you just buy a regular toaster as it takes a long time to toast-almost 10 mins. and you have to keep watch it doesn't burn if you use the timer. The same with baking. Also, the directions tell you to unplug after using as it could be a fire hazard. It does the job, but don't rely on the timer."
5,The Gift that keeps on giving!,I gifted Erin's Prenatal Fitness Fix DVD to friends that are expecting.With great thanks for Erin's DVD here what they thought!!!!1st TIME MOM.....I wanted to stay active. However I found my self sitting. My body was changing I felt awkward exercising. Erin's workout what just what I needed to activate myself again!! I feel great!2nd Time MOM...Erin's workout is my golden Mom time...Stress release and energy booster!! I feel great and my friends tell me I look great!4 children and not expecting... Erin's workout rejuvenates me. I need a lot of energy and even more stress release. I find tranquility when I am working out to Erin's workout. My husband tells me how great I look and I know how great I feel!!!Truly the gift that keeps on giving!!!
1,I would NOT recommend this,"Bad lightening, bad audio, I can barely watch this without getting really angry for buying this! I would NOT recommended this DVD!"
5,Great work out,I love this video. I was active before pregnancy so I wanted something that felt like a burn during working out. Also because of major back issues during pregnancy I was unable to use the treadmill. This has helped my back greatly.
5,Terrific Workout for Mommies-to-be,I consider myself an active person and was concerned about finding ways to exercise during pregnancy that would be challenging but not dangerous. I found the DVD to be at a great pace - a challenge but not too difficult. Erin narrates with a smile & humor without being annoying. I recommend this for someone looking for a good workout while pregnant.
5,Just what I need to stay in a good shape at 30 weeks,"I rarely review items, but after having finished this video for the hundredth time during my pregnancy, I decided to leave a very positive feedback. Erin is amazing. She may seem intimidating, super-woman-like, when you watch her doing her routine for the first time. I personally thought she was crazy and wondered what her baby looked like when she delivered. But when I actually did the video, I was pleasantly surprised that she gave me just the right amount of exercise and energy I needed. I've been doing this routine since the first trimester. I'm 30 weeks along and not going to stop. I feel great and in a good shape. Don't be scared by the negative reviews."
4,Like this one,"I like this workout; Erin keeps the workout moving and I feel like I've exercised all parts once I'm done. I work out every day, and did the same pre-pregnancy. The reason why I'm giving four out of five stars is I wish that instead of a 20 minute partner workout with her husband she would have done a 20 minute ""express"" workout for days you don't have much time. I feel like working out with a partner is pretty goofy -- working out is my ""alone"" de-stress time for me."
2,Poor Quality and not interesting,I did not like this video or workout at all. It looks like a homemade video and made up as you go workout. The part that includes the husband is also unmotivating because she bosses him around and he seems very uninterested. There are better videos out there. I recommend Lindsay Brin's Mom's into Fitness.
3,Wow it's a workout!!!,This video is very fast moving and really gets your heart rate up. I had to slow down many times in order to keep my heart rate at a healthy level. If you are enjoy a heavy workout you will love this dvd.
1,Not worth the money ... poorly edited.,"I would not recommend this video for purchase. The quality is sub-par, little time was invested into editing (home video style). The exercises are elementary, nothing original, and could be obtained from free videos uploaded onto YouTube. In my opinion, this video should be priced at $1-2 for purchase. I regret purchasing this video."
2,O'Brien has very little knowledge on this subject!,"Yes, Erin O'Brien may be a personal trainer with is a certification after a number of ""training hours"" and probably would do a great job working at a gym with the general public. Unfortunately she has VERY limited knowlege of the changes that happen physiologically within the body during pregnancy and the precautions that should be taken during this workout at various stages of pregnancy. I am pregnant with my second child and am a physical therapist. If I did not have a broad underatnding of precatutions that shoudl be taken not to damage my pelvis or low back during her numerous squats and one legged activities I would most likely have a significant injury that would cause me pain through the rest of my pregnancy. Look elsewhere for a workout DVD by someone who specializes in womens health and fitness."
2,Hyper-Advanced workout,"My wife thought this would be a useful video after viewing an interview with Erin and her husband on television. I found this to be fast-paced and much more advanced than what we were expecting. If you are a hard-core aerobics junkie then this must be designed for you--I am not pregnant and I found the pace painful to even watch; oh, and the partner portion of the video is perfect for those that need more than their own weight to use during aerobics. Erin's husband provides more resistance by leaning on top of his wife through the exercises, as if being pregnant was not enough.I am sure Erin means well. However, for a normal person, you may need to watch the video at half-speed to keep up. James Denton seemed as bewildered as I, but it was cool to see another puzzled husband accomodating his wife. He did his best going through with the exercises, so kudos to him for supporting his energetic wife in this enterprise."
2,Very poor filming,"This video is terrible. I have turned it on twice to try to do it and just can't. The filming is just terrible. It's filmed in her living room, which is fine. It gives you a sense you can do it at home. However, the lighting is terrible. The sun is in your eyes and just incredibly shadowy. Besides that she uses her furniture for all of the exercises. Again, you think great. You'll be able to do this at home. That is probably the case if you have traditional furniture, sofa, coffee table, and chair. However, I have an automan instead of a coffee table, my couch is against the wall. So? Other than that it is just boring, with elevator music playing in the back ground. A positive is that it does look like a good work out. I do a lot of exercise with videos at home. So I can see that it looks safe and has a good intensity. I just couldn't stand to watch the thing."
3,Pretty good,"I'm only about 6 weeks pregnant but I decided to go ahead and try to find a comparable workout video to what I've already been doing. With my last pregnancy I used Denise Austin and I was really unimpressed; however, this one was pretty decent. She does go from one move to the next somewhat fast and it doesn't give you much time to get your props ready. Once you've gone through the DVD once though you'll be prepared for the next time. The production value isn't very good either. It was definitely just shot in her home, but you still get a really good workout. I would probably give it one more star if it had other women in different stages of their pregnancy. This only has Denise herself doing the entire workout. I would recommend it though in addition to some brisk walking a few times a week."
4,Finally a decent prenatal workout,"I just did the 40 minute workout today. I'm 28 weeks pregnant and I've just had a hard time getting to the gym lately. So I decided to freeze my gym membership and try some home workouts. This one was challenging and I actually felt like I did something worth my while. I love that she added body weight strength training. What I like most is that she's not annoying at all. So far the other prenatal workout DVD's, ramble on and on about connecting to my baby while I'm working out and that really annoys me. I'm working out to try to stay in shape, not to connect with the baby. I'll do that during a more relaxing time. So, I give this DVD 2 thumbs up."
1,Not what I expected,"This was the only pregnancy DVD that was available in my local record store so I picked it up. I'm in my fourth month and haven't been able to do much in my first trimester since I was on Bedrest. I was pretty disappointed with this DVD, the sound, image quality is not the best looks quite amateurish. I think they use her husbands celebrity status to sell this more than the benefit of the workout itself.And to be honest I found her to be quite annoying when she keeps saying, 'Go go go' every second....."
5,Great Workout for All Levels,"I'm a regular at the gym and wanted something to do at home when it was too cold or I was too tired to drive to the gym. No equipment needed and a small space works too. This video is great, not too slow or easy going and the 40 mins is just the right time, then if your partner is around you can always add that part or just modify and do the whole thing yourself. After taking a break from the gym due to exhaustion this was the perfect way to get back into working out."
5,Great for really working your body.,"I am only 5 weeks along and did this video and sweat the first time. I can see when I get into my 3rd trimester it will be tough, but that is the point. I want to keep my muscles toned all through my pregnancy and that takes work. I have a Denise Austin video that was boring compared to this. Also, she does it in a living room setting using a coffee table and couch as props. It is very realistic and shows you, you can do this is a tight space. Also has a great 20 minutes separate workout to do with your husband helping. I like it becasue she changes routine just when you think you can't handle one more of the rep you are in. She even pauses for pee breaks and water breaks. I should add, I just had a baby 6 months ago and even though I lost all my weight, I am not in tip top shape and I was able to do the entire video. She gives instruction on how to make it less hard if you are having trouble."
1,Does not flow well,"This is the strangest workout video I've ever seen. It does not flow well at all and she's very breathy as she's doing the moves. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this video. There are much, much better ones out there!"
4,A great workout!! Actually makes you sweat...,"I was in pretty poor shape before I got pregnant. I was too tired to work out the first 11 weeks, but at 11 weeks I started doing this DVD and it was enough of a workout to make me A) sweat (a lot) and B) SORE! I started doing this 2-3 times a week...by the time it started to get ""easy"" for me, my belly started growing and it was getting to be a real workout again. I am not 27 weeks and do it about once a week. I will probably start using it more often when it gets a little hotter and I can no longer go on walks outside.There are some issues with the sound during the DVD so I gave it four stars (it can be a bit hard to hear, but once you've done it a few times you really don't need ti hear it).I have not tried the partner workout portion of this DVD."
2,Can't make myself sit through it again,"I've done this video 2-3 times, and I can't make myself do it again.She is a cute, fit little lady, and knows her stuff, but I just don't like it. It's not a hard workout, and there's too much non-workout related material and talking to sit through. For example she says: ""If you have to go to the lou, pause me, don't make me work-out alone,"" then a couple minutes later she runs off the set to use the ""lou""."
3,Ehhh... Depends on your workout style,"I am not in fantastic shape, but I am not new to exercise either. From the reviews, I was anxious to try this workout... but, in the end, it is just not for me. There is no fun or entertaining value to this workout, no jazzy or dancey moves. It's just Erin in her living room moving around. She is extremely well versed in prenatal fitness, and for people who just want to go through the motions and get it over with it will probably be an excellent workout. So, if you are looking for something fun and different... this workout is not for you. I've always needed a bit more motivation and dancing to keep me interested."
3,Poorly made,"While the workout itself is challenging and fairly interesting, the quality of the DVD is very poor. It creates a distraction from the workout. She is appears to have her husband recording the video in her living room. I also would have preferred a little more of a cardio aspect to the workout, this DVD tends to focus on more stationary exercises that help work the muscles but not necessarily get the heart-rate up. Overall it is worth doing if you have other DVD's to fall back on, because repeated use of this one would get dull pretty quick."
2,Fitness Fix,"I was so excited to try out this video, but I have to say I was very dissapointed. After the reviews I read I thought this was going to be a good workout. I don't think I broke a sweat once during the entire thing. I could have folded the laundry and had a better workout. I was 17 weeks when I tried this and running has become difficult with all the trips to the bathroom and some round ligament pain. I think this video is meant for people who eiether have never done any type of exercise before or who are in their 7th or 8th month of pregnancy. I am used to running about 20-30 miles a week so if you are expecting a good heart pumping workout from this you are going to be very dissapointed. Go for a fast paced walk instead. The quality of the video was fine and the music did not bother me. I have also purchased the video with Karen S, but have not tried it after I wasted 40 minutes on this one."
2,ANNOYING!!!!,No one else found this woman annoying as hell? Its an ok workout if I put her on mute and use my ipod. By the way who is on the cover? It looks like an entirely different person one you put the dvd on. Her stomach is hanging out and I just found her revolting. She needs James Denton to come on just so people will buy this. I tried to pass it off to a pregnant friend of mine and she gave it back to me cause she couldn't stand her either- ya uh ha your ok your ok. I'll take Denise Austin anyday over this lady.
5,Great for Moms (and Dads) -To-Be!,"I have absolutely no experience with childbirth, but I do know the presenter, Erin O'Brien, to be one of the most knowledgable, friendly and talented instructors on the Los Angeles fitness scene. This is also a beautifully produced DVD that is quite evidently a safe and effective program for expectant parents."
4,This series deserves better,"Triloka had put out the wonderful series ""Trance Planet"", which I had to own all volumes for, but Planet Chant really left alot to be desired. In places it was far too ""techno"" for the subject matter. If you are expecting indigenous chants and slices of life from places around the globe such as the label implies, its best to look elsewhere. It is a good CD, but not one that is memorable in the way that the other Trance Planet series CD's are."
2,i pod and i tunes garage,This book is so outdated its almost comletely uselessGuess I should have known that from its $.25 priceYou get what you pay for
1,Terrible,"Not to go against the curve here, but I must say this book is a complete waste of money. Any idiot can figure out half of the ""secrets"" mentioned in this book. The author also wastes about half of the book explaining how to do such mundane tasks as installing itunes and charging your ipod. DO NOT BUY YOU CAN FIND ALL THESE ANSWERS ONLINE WITHIN MINUTES."
4,Interesting Insight into Cartooning for Real Fans,"Dan Piraro draws Bizarro, a daily nationally syndicated cartoon strip. It is a single panel strip in the same vein as Gary Larson's Far Side. Having said that, he is still an original with a very offbeat but funny sense of humor. This book is part autobiographical and part about his odyssey across the USA during a shoe-string budget book promotional trip. It is quite amusing. He describes his childhood, his erratic climb to his profession, and his current situation with a ironic almost detached bemusement. While many of the observations and insights are very funny, it helps if the reader knows his strip, and follows cartoons. Some of the observations about the habits of cartoonists, and their often sad lives are best appreciated in this light. Short Summary: funny book about a cartoonist life but will be even funnier to those who follow his strip and cartooning in general"
4,"An amusing, light easy read full of quirky humour.","This book catalogues the (mis) adventures of a cartoonist doing a book tour on the cheap by enlisting the aide of his fans. The stories are amusing, spiced up by Dan Piraro's quirky, clever sense of humour, much like his single panel comic. Much self-deprecation abounds, no tangent is left unexplored, no pop culture references are omitted, and much lighthearted fun awaits the reader. In the process you do end up with some sense of who this person is, and what his life has been like to date. Recommended for those who enjoy his comic or like clever, offbeat, and, sometimes, even downright bizarre, humour."
3,Hope you don't need to draw in a hurry.,"My RUger is very hard to draw from this holster. Hopefully it will ""wear in"" and make it an easier draw. I do like the fit of the hip paddle."
5,Uniden Atlantis 250Bk,"I bought one of these for everyday use in the Everglades, and have had no problem with it, it has even been subject to my waterproof and drop tests (been submerged in marsh water and rained on multiple times dropped on cement, gravel, in sand, and mud.) and have had no transmitting or recieving problems. Unfortunately, if you drop it on cement from 8 feet just the right way you can crack the threaded part that the antenna attaches to. I have transmitted and recieved as far as 8 miles with this radio. My line of sight is open and there is no electronic interference where I am, so individual results may vary. Even though I broke mine im buying another, and than I will have a spare battery. For the price, not a bad deal."
1,Uniden Atlantis,"Battery for radio does not last 6 hours, after charging per manufacturers instrucions. Very dissappointed with this product. Radion seems to function, transmitt, and recieve okay...but without a battery its useless!!!"
3,Poor signal,"Maybe I have unrealistic expectations for a marine band radio and maybe it is due to our terrain, but I was expecting clear transmition farther than a mile."
1,"$1,692.00??? Is it made of gold or silver?","It looks like a nice vice, but for a normal price of $1,692.00 it should be. Of course through volume purchasing Amazon managed to get the price down to $651.33 but that is still a bit expensive for a 6"" vice. Instead of spending $651.33 to hold a pipe, I will lay the pipe on my front porch and hold it down with a concrete block which costs $0.98 at Lowes."
1,too dam much,6 in vise cost about 80.00 daller at home depot maybe 100.00 an i cant belive a 6in vise wait is 146 pounds that would be 100.00 a pound hahaha
5,Great!,These were so easy to use and turned out looking so great & very detailed! The dump truck lollipops were a HUGE hit at my nephew's construction birthday party!!
3,.,i have a taurus 66 4 inch barrel 7 shot revolver. fits alright. But i have to get a different holster as this one will take out the blueing on my gun
5,Nice owb holster. Works for S & W 686 .357 mag,This holster works great for my S & W 686 with a 2 in barrel. Fantastic product! Really stays put.
5,"Fits 4"" 686 fine","I like the Fobus holsters for range use. They are inexpensive, fit their targeted application, paddle makes it easy to swap while on the line."
5,GREAT!,a great trade and a truly great book by one of my favorite authors... it came fast and in great shape
3,"Moments of brilliance, some mediocrity","Having seen the Neville Bros. in concert dozens of times, I will admit no recording will every do justice to their live performances. This recording does capture the funky nature of their music, however, it does not reflect the best efforts of the band. If you don't have any of their music, I would suggest ""Yellow Moon"" to begin your collection. If you are adding to your Nevilles bag, this is a solid cd."
2,Another dissapointment,"This book threw me for a loop. It was flooded with misleading information on admissions, school requirements, and what is needed to apply. In one part of the book they tell you that you don't need a high school diploma to get into Harvard of all places. I went back and forth for days trying to figure out if that was a misprint or what. It's almost like you have to go to school to learn how to decipher the information in these books. Don't waste you money!"
4,Clear & Concise,"This is a clear and concise text that covers the necessary fundamentals well. Apparently the previous reviewer is not aware that many top schools accept home-schooled students without the school diploma, hence the ""No high school diploma required."", which is important for those students and parents to know."
2,Dissapointing Remakes; Misleading Packaging,"Shortly before his plane crash, Rick Nelson went into the studio and recorded this album of remakes of many of his best songs. It's become a fad for artists to do remakes of their own work, but I've never been more disappointed with such work as I was here. Not one of the songs is anywhere near as good as the original versions (and ""Garden Party"" was pretty lame to begin with!) It's hard for me to understand, as anyone who's heard the LIVE 1983-1985 album can attest he brought MORE power to his oldies as the years went by, not less-- as here.But the worst thing is that, apart from the cover photo, NOTHING on the outside packaging hints that these are anything other than the ""original"" recordings. For SHAME, Curb Records!!!"
3,Disappointed,I was under the impression that I was getting the original releases( Best of Ricky Nelson ). Instead it was a recut that didn't have the same sound and range in his voice. He sounds dull and lifeless when compared to the original releases. Very disappointing. He sounds like he is on drugs. Do you have a CD of his original releases?
2,Not the original releases,"I can't believe I actually bought this CD twice. These are not Ricky Nelson's original recordings but re-recordings he made later in life. Even Garden Party doesn't have the original ""spunk"". The songs are OK, but the originals are much better."
1,Just ok,"This album consists of later recordings of his earlier songs. These are NOT , I repeat Not his ORIGINAL studio recordings from the '50's. I wish someone had told me that before I bought it. However, Ricky is still Ricky, young or old. He's still great. But be forewarned: These are later recordings."
1,A Late in Life Remake,"A tired depressing remake by Ricky Nelson of some of his best songs. The sound quality is poor, and Ricky lacks any real energy. Not the way I'd like to remember him."
2,"Good selection of songs, poor quality sound",Maybe with a great equalizer and a lot of patience you can make this one sound good. I cranked up the bass a little and the treble a lot and it still sounded flat. No presence. Something is wrong.
4,I like it,"As I said before I like the old music,you can understand the words.The story makes sense.And the melody is usually very nice."
4,Best of ricky,I heard these songs many years ago and decided to give myself a treat. It has great music and thanks.
5,Solo guitar piece a great injection of talent in 3rd track,"While the whole CD resonates with tight vocals to music, I especially enjoyed the guitar solo in Best Christmas Ever. The talented musician, Ian, really added depth to this piece with his dynamic energy driving this solo piece. Great piece of work! Know the music world will be hearing more from this guitarist.CLASact in Canada"
1,The book does not contain enought info or illustrations.,The manual has very litte information concering the instalation and removal of the radio.The same can be said for the installation/removal of the water pump. I found it difficulat to find the capasities for the fluids. I would not recomend buying this book for any Volvo owners.
3,Helped out a Lot,I have never had a manual cover every question I have had on any product.This one does a fair job of meeting the general needs.
1,Need good reference books for 760 Turbo Stationwagon (1990),Anybody have info. on where I can purchase a book on this subject - one that is useful? Having read many of the reviews associated with a lot of the books listed doesn't look too promising! Thank you.
2,Not my kind of reading,"For those who enjoy this genre--well, go for it. Not my cuppa tea. Shallow characters. Interesting plot twist at the end, but...still not my cuppa tea. Sorry, Ms Daily, I really wanted to like it."
3,Could Be Better,"This program has some cute cards you can make. Its not real simple to be creative with it, other than the standard desighns. Most cards you cant c personalize the cover. I copy from this program to Microsoft Home Publishing to have any creative control."
5,Hallmark Comedy Card Studio,"Great program. Just whaat I was looking for, although would have been nice if it were more updated. Thanks, JG"
5,Would love this BUT!!!,"I have windows XP--- Do you have Hallmark Comedy Studio that can be used on XP? Or Hallmark Studio software that contains MAXINE? If so, I would like to purchase it A.S.A.P.THANK YOU!"
2,Overrated,"The toy is too sophisticated for the only age group that will tolerate the lack of graphics, i.e., 3-4 yr olds. We got this for Christmas for our yougner son, because our older son was getting a Nintendo DS. After about a week of carrying it around and not really being able to play with it meaningfully, he got a hold of his older brother's leap frog and has been playing with it ever since. Don't waste your money on this. The keyboard has too much info on it and is too elaborate for little hands."
1,Don't use this book- Errors!!!,"My son was only in the first chapter of this book and found two significant Math errors. I feel that is unacceptable, especially in a review book, which a child is likely to do on his/her own, and will need to rely on the answers in the book rather than having a teacher available to correct any errors."
2,Arrow Flags,"Item arrived promptly but the shipping and handling charge was out of this world, over $9. I will not be ordering anything else from this company again due to their outrageous shipping fees. The item I ordered weighed less than a half ounce."
4,Excellent book!,"Excellent book with a systematic review of all aspect of scout / sniping; it does not just cover the shooting part, but also the tactics, camouflage, egress / ingress, etc... It is mainly aimed at military, not police or civilian use.(...)"
4,Neat,"What can i say? This is the official USMC Scout/sniper training manual. Here you'll find everything you need to be a good sniper, and all the informations you should have if you are interested in this field."
1,Unreadable,Unfortunately the printed letters are too small to read this exellent book. I read it in German. I wanted to give this book to my wife as a present.
3,No es el titulo correcto del libro,"La trama del libro es buena, pero es muy poco de lo se habla sobre la genética es un libro más bien policial, me hubiera gustado más (por el estado de ánimo seguramente) si el título fuera otro, pues cuando uno cree que va a leer algo (genética en este caso) y el libro apenas menciona el tema baja el estado de ánimo hacia el libro."
3,Best polish ever for jewelry,I have used this polish for years on my fine jewelry. Makes your jewelry both 14 kt gold and sterling silver look like it just came out of the show case. Takes out scratches and makes your jewelry look brand new. Just rub in on and polish with a cloth and then wash the piece with soap and water to remove the residual flitz. If necessary use a toothbrush to get into all of the crevices.
2,Great...at the time,"I love vintage Golden books, and I love Jane Werner Watson, but this isn't a good book for modern students of science. It's a survey of scientific professions of the 1960s, illustrated by photographs. Totally great motivation in the immediate post-Sputnik/Space Race world, but no kid of today is going to get anything out of it, and the photos are so hokey it can't even be chopped up for crafts. Just FYI."
3,A Pun-filled Romp,"After reading several of the Callahan's Place books, I decided to try the Lady Sally series. Not as enjoyable or as deep, in my opinion, but still an interesting read. As in many of Callahan's books, the exposition takes forever. And just as typically, there is a huge Deus ex machina at the end. This particular one really insulted my intelligence. The wrap-up was just too easy and convenient.If puns are not your thing, avoid all of Robinson's books!"
4,Good clean fun,"... in a bawdy house. Well, they're supposed to be clean and they're supposed to be fun, right?These are basically feel-good stories, and they work. I mean ""feel-good"" in the emotional sense. Despite a few harsh scenes, all who deserve it (and some who don't) live happily ever after. The entertainers and the clientele certainly feel each other well, too. That, however, is all hidden tastefully off stage or under euphemism. I wouldn't have any qualms about any kid I know reading the book.You may find this book filed with science fiction. That's probably because of the writer's other work and not because of these stories' content. The SF-ish parts appear only briefly, once to get a story started and once to get a story ended. If you're not a SF fan, there's still plenty here for you.It's light, fluffy, and fun. When you're done with deep meanings and grand literature for the day, give this one a try."
3,Fair item VERY POOR COMPANY,"The first one was DOA, but was replaced by Amazon with no hassle. (Thanks). The second one works as advertised with one big problem. I have an older Tritton NAS 120 that has been running 24/7 for over 4 years. This one was going to supplement the smaller 120. Both cannot be on at the same time on the network without jumping through hoops. They have different IP address, Mac codes and names. If both are on when any computer on the network is booted up the older 120 will not respond to the computer, it requests a password but does not think it's correct. If the newer one is off the 120 acts normal, then turn on turn the new one on and both work fine. This has to be done for all computers. Three emails to the company have not been answered this item rated a 3 the company rated a -10"
4,Another entry in my nostagia world book tour,"I re-owned this book as a consequence of having to clean all my books out of my father's house and found myself again in possession of all the books I had hoarded as a pre-teen and teenager. I remembered liking this series a great deal and decided to see how it stood the test of time.Surprisingly well, is the answer. Although _The Tar-Aiym Krang_ remains my favorite in the series, FLOMN is a nice portrait of the hero as a young boy. Particularly well-done is the way that he bonds with Pip and Mother Mastiff. More character than adventure, but that is not such a bad thing.I will be holding on to this one."
3,For Love of Mother-Not,"For Love of Mother-NotThis, the first book in the Pip and Flinx series, sets the stage for the rest of his adventures. It tells of how he came to find Pip, and, how the Meliorare Society came to find him.It was a fairly well written action/adventure story, the character has interesting morals and, there is some bad language. However, I did enjoy reading something where the hero didn't just, ""come to his full power in the nick of time and the evil ones from the universe"" and, also, I liked the fact that the enemy didn't all ""see the evil of their way and turn to the right path"" which, (don't get me wrong) I like, but not to the exclusion of the bad guys getting what they had coming in the end."
4,a good read in a great series,i enjoyed reading the beginning of the story arch how flinx was adopted by mother and met pip and the bad guys wanting to control him... i deducted a star because the descriptive prose did not allow me to envision the places the adventures took place very well and a little because they publisher chose to not allow text to speech reading... i purchased 2 more in the series but wont read them because i cant 'listen' to them... i should have looked closer at the description and will do so in the future.
2,Needs an editor,"This is an ok story, worth a read. However, it was full of spelling and grammatical errors. So much so that even I started noticing (someone who barely passed language classes in college after a second attempt). The author gives away to much of the mysteries before it is relevant in the story to reveal them. This made it hard at times to continue reading."
2,Couldn't finish it,"This is my first novel by Foster. I find it hard to believe he has so many books to his name, because the quality of writing in this one is so poor I couldn't get more than halfway through it. The premise of the book is ok and the plot is no more predictable than many similar books. But the writing -- bad dialogue, weird pacing, badly developed characters, it all gets in the way of enjoying the story. In a few pages, with almost no description, the main character goes from being a scared orphan kid to some kind of vigilante who can hotwire vehicles and break into secure areas. The help he picks up along the way is no more believable. I couldn't finish it, I hope you can."
1,Not For Me!,"I love heels, the higher the better. I also adore shoes by Steven. This shoe however did nothing for me. I tried to wear it several times and always took it off to change into another pair. I don't know if it was the gold color, and I really prefer bronze. Whatever it was, I gave the shoe to charity. It would have set new in the box forever. This way, hopefully someone will get to wear them, and maybe like them!"
2,not the best,"This book was okay,but definitely NOT one of the better Pine Hollow books.The seemed like it was just a longer version of the back cover.The back cover gave the whole book away.And I can't stand Cam.He's SO annoying.Always just randomely showing up where Carole was and all he wanted to do was kiss,kiss,and kiss some more.It was to mushy.I think Bonnie is a great author,but this was definitely one of her worst yet."
5,An Outstanding Book!,"This was Bonnie Bryant's best work yet! It had a great story line to it, and a lot of things were cleared up form the last book. It really startled me to find out what Lisa's decision was about going out. Callie is also having sort of a rough time in this book. George just needs to get on with his life (Not to sound nasty :) and leave Callie alone. All in all, a GREAT read."
5,Waiting for October...,"As soon as I finished this book, I became curious as to what would happen next. Not only does it wrap up loose ends, but it keeps you in suspence as to what will happen in later books. What's going on with Ben? Does he actually like Carole? I am also very happy that Stevie and Veronica are at odds again I was afraid that whole dynamic was gone! I thought I had heard that Stevie, Carole , and Lisa were going out west to the Bar None in a later book. As anyone else heard that? That would be so cool if they did. It would be neat to know how everyone is doing four years later. The Pine Hollow series just keeps getting better, so keep up the great work, Ms. Bryant! *To everyone who thinks this series is actually written for children aged 9-12, like some of the reviews say, then you're wrong. It's really geared more toward young adults.*"
3,An ok book,I thought this was an ok book. It's a little weird with Carol and Cam though. At the beginning of the book they have just met again and at the end they are like an old married couple. The other Pine Hollow books were better but this one was ok.
1,IF YOU LOVE COMMUNITY COOKBOOKS THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU,"I REGRET TO SAY THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DID US NO FAVOR WHEN THEY PUBLISHED THIS BOOK. I WAS EXPECTING A FINE NARRATIVE ON THE HISTORY OF COMMUNITY COOKBOOKS AND INSTEAD PLOWED THROUGH A DISSERTAION ON FEMINISM, PERSONAL CULTURAL ATTITUDES AND DOWN-RIGHT BORING TRIVIA MIXED IN WITH A FEW FACTS THAT WOULD BE WORTH YOUR TIME IF THEY WEREN'T BURIED IN THE THESIS STYLE OF WRITING. WHAT A PITY TO RUIN A GOOD BASIC SUBJECT WITH ACADEMIA DRIBBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. IT WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON A GOOD COMMUNITY COOKBOOK THAT BENEFITS YOUR FAVORITE OGANIZATION."
4,Good but consider 4th edition,"I bought this book a long time ago which is why I'm reviewing this version instead ofMore Math Into LaTeX, 4th Edition. At the time it was published, this was one of the best LaTeX cookbooks for math that you could get. I recommend searching for something else as there are probably better alternatives now."
5,Brilliant and beautiful,"I don't know how this movie got into my Netflix queue, but it took my breath away. Brilliant and deceptively beautiful, and acted by ""real people,"" not professional actors. What a lovely and realistic look at life in China, and what a moving depiction of a loving heart.Not to be missed."
4,As real as it gets,"I lived in China for three years. This film is as real as it gets. The Chinese people that I met find this movie fascinating. It is a very good look into their complex culture. Make no mistake, this is a culture that is very foreign to Western culture. For this reason not everyone will ""get"" this film."
3,Charming feel-good movie,"The back-of-the-box version of this story - a teenage teacher from bumbletown ventures into the big city to find her lost student - really makes a lot more sense than the actual plot, where her motivations are left more or less inexplicable behind the cloak of her reticence. The movie is more valuable for local color and Cultural Understanding than it is for characterization; it's a re-enactment of a true story, and pretty much all the characters are playing what they really are - the adorable little farm kids really are adorable farm kids in real life, etc.Recommended for students of Mandarin as the vocabulary level is pretty simple."
3,Not impressed,It is interesting to see a chinese movie depicting life in rural China. The actors were recruited among the locals and it shows. Actng is poor. The film is slow. My 8 and 10 year old children enjoyed the movie.
2,"when your family may not survive, you must still go to school","this is a story about a teenage teacher: she thought that even in poverty when a kid's whole family may not survive, the kid should not go to work so that the family can live on, but rather, the kid should and must go to school so that he can learn to write some words. so she tried to follow the guidance of the elder teacher who left earlier: ""not one student less"" and she tried to hunt the kid down in the city and dragged him back to school while abandoning all the other students in the school.so this is the movie. it gave us a lecture on what is ""should"" and what is ""must"": a kid should and must go to school even if his family may not be able to survive."
5,Your heart will sing & cry - again!,"I'm originally a Chinese-decent, so maybe that's why Not One Less had made such a significant impact on me. The film is high-spirited; the characters/actors are commonly uncommon, and beautifully rendered - they will move you! See the film, and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
4,Wonderful film....,"It's almost always the case that a director such as Yimou must send a film over here to the States to prove that elegant and yet simple film making still exists. It's almost as if Yimou just turned the camera on the lives of real people, and put microphones on them and just let us in. The result, for me, was a hypnotic curiousity in the lives of people that live in a very different culture and society as me, yet share the human qualities in us all: hope, compassion, love, and so on.While the movie is subtitled, I think many children could understand much of this movie and enjoy it. I think kids could enjoy the movies adventure aspect, especially since children are the main stars here.This is another movie that I hope many people will set aside their reservations, and try something different. It is worth seeking out."
4,Hilarious!,"I loved this movie because they used non-actors and the cast are just so natural and real. When you watch this film, devoid of the slick Hollywood movie magic that we've all gotten so used to, you can't help but be moved by the storyline.Also, because there's really no 'acting' in this movie, it is really funny to watch these people so obviously working to tell this story with little to no acting skills whatsoever. What results is a comical, touching and magical film about a young woman in an impossible situation and her quest to find her young charge in the big city.It ends like a fairy tale. I just loved it."
3,Armoire received damaged,I received this item in good time. However I was distraught when I opened this item the day before my wife's birthday only to find that the bottom draw was broken (the back had come loose from the fascia) and the underside of the lid was very badly scratched. This was very disappointing and I feel that some better quality control would have caught this before it was shipped.
2,Armoire Review,"Unfortunately the product I recieved was defective and had to be returned. The bottom drawer was stuck and wouldn't come out. Not only did this eliminate use of that drawer, it also prohibited the attachment of the legs to the armoire since the screws to attach the legs were located beside the bottom drawer.The Company I purchased the armoire from, VISIONDECOR, was very accomodating and easy to work with. I highly recommend doing business with them."
4,Beautiful,"This item was a gift from myself to myself, and I love it! The dark woods and drawer handle style is lovely. I pondered over what might be improved with this item, and could only find 2 negative drawbacks:1.) The dividers divide the upper few drawers into 4 compartments. If you have a lot of small earrings, they don't each get their own small divider (and can easily get lost).2.)Although the drawer handles are pretty, they often like to stay in the ""up position,"" once you've closed the doors and you have to fix it so they all look uniform.Minute details, I am happy with it."
1,armoire,"it was not as nice as i thought, its cheaply made the wood is good but it looks like a 2 year old put it together."
3,Poor design,"The Fellowes PDA Stylus Pen is just a regular pen, the stylus part is just a pointy thing on the pen barrel. Since the stylus isn't centered on the pen, and the pen is rather thick, you actually need to rotate the pen in your hand so that the pointy part is downwards whenever you want to write on your PDA, otherwise the pen barrel will touch the screen.The plastic of the pen barrel/stylus seems to be made from very soft plastic, it leaves marks on my PDA's screen protector which can be easily wiped off."
2,DVD is unfortunately a reproduction of a TV portrait,Dear AllAfter having seen this one I feel that I have to say that what could have been a great DVD is just not a good one. I have seen Sissel in concert both in Denmark and in Norway so I know that she's good in concert. But unfortunately the producers have cut the concert to pieces and replaced her comments with some portait so it does not give the right impression whatsoever of the kind of person you wil meet if buying a ticket
3,Thought it was a CD,I made the mistake of thinking this was a CD..Bought it for a present and it was opened..now unable to return. All my fault.
5,Sissel In Concert,I first heard Sissel sing on a U Tube video. Awesome! This DVD was better than the U Tube video. I would buy this DVD again!!Buy from Amazon and you won't be dissapointed!
2,"Great music, but far too little of it","Even at the low price for this album, it's not worth the money. While Count Basie's music is great, there is no reason for EMI to offer a CD with less than 35 minutes of music. These are hardly Basie's most popular recordings, either- no ""April in Paris"" for example. A very nice version of ""Lullaby of Birdland"" is a highlight, but there should be much more music on this album."
5,"Tried, tested and true","Finally, a mouthguard for people woth braces! My son (a goalie) said these fit great (from what I could tell, they do indeed seem to fit nicely!) and aren't huge or anything like that to make them get in the way or fit uncomfortably. I'd buy this product again."
2,not such a great fit,these are 2 seperate peices. So you have to mold one then the other. My son has braces and that is why we got these. With the braces they don't mold very well and it is hard to have 2 peices in your mouth and beable to speak at all.
2,Braces,"I wore this mouthpiece a few times for basketball. I then took it to my orthodontist at my next appointment. He immediately said that this is not a good mouthpiece for those with braces. He explained that which braces, your teeth are constantly moving. This mouth piece restricts the movement and becomes a hinderance. Yes, it may be comfortable but it is not good. He then gave me a mouthpiece that resembles a football mouthpiece in the front. It fits inside your mouth completely. It has a piece of rubber that you bite down on in the middle of the mouthpiece and it allows you teeth to move. If you wear braces, ask your orthodontist about a proper mouth guard. Wearing the wrong one could prolong your treatment."
2,disappointing...,"i totally LOVED Pierce's Song of the Lioness, circle of magic, Immortals, and circle opens quartets, but I have to say that this one left me sorely disappointed. Though the style of writing remained the same, the plot and the characters were lacking. The brilliance of the plots of the first couple quartets seem to be wearing off. I dont like the character of Kel at all. It really bothers me that shes just soo lovesick all the time. Shes supposed to be a strong female character, yet all she does is throw herself at different male characters. She is only 12 years old for heaven's sake. After reading this book, ive stopped reading any more of Ms. Pierce's books, yet mayb ill start the next quartet in hopes that Ms. Pierce's writing has improved."
5,Too short,"For an adult reader the book should be read as the first part of the complete quartet. Since it was designed to snag the youthful reader this may be good thing. Readers should be sure to have ""Page"" to continue the begining. My sister and I listen to ""Wolf Speaker"" and the quartet 'in order' every so often and throughly enjoy them. This is recommened for all ages."
5,Still wonderful!,"This is the second book in a series following the adventures of Keladry, a young girl who wants to be a knight. She overcomes all the obstacles put in her path by the conservatives in power who think women shouldn't be knights. There are wonderful relationships with the other pages, fully subplots with her coterie of animal companions, and a real understanding by the author of what it's like to be a square peg in a round hole. Good gift for any young woman struggling with identity issues."
5,Read it again and again,I'm truely glad to have found Tamora Pierce at such an affordable price. I can get more of her books for my daughter. It's all she reads and she reads them quickly too. Thank you for sending them so quickly.
5,I loved this book!,"I love Tamara Pierce's books, they are the best! I have read them all and ""Protecter of the Small"" carries on her strong heriones. If you haven't read ""The Song of the Lioness Quartet""or ""The Immortals"" you should because not only are they good background for ""Protector"" but they are really good books!""Protector"" is about the first known female knight in 100 years it follows her trials and tribulations. Kelardry of Mindelan is very rough-and-tumble you see her make friends and enimies along the way. You read as she fights with her massivie fear of hights Kel comes of very human(not like Brittney Spears) and you can relate to her an she seems like the girl next door. This is a great book by an amazing author."
3,Pricey,"My understanding of ebooks was that they would cost less because they saved paper and ink and such. I believe this ebook is at least a dollar more expensive than a paper copy. Otherwise, great book, wonderful story."
4,Better Than First Test!,"Page is better than First Test. Daine is featured a little more prominently for all you Immortals fans and the pace here is more comfortable than in First Test. Kel is becoming a really interesting character, and I can't wait for the next book!"
4,Another triumph for Pierce!,"This is a fabulous book that is an excellent sequal to First Test! The characters are vivid and exciting, growing and changing just enough as the book continues. The plot, as always, is a perfect mixture of excitement and less exciting events, which make this book a real page turner! As with her other books, it has just enough forshadowing to make to long to read the following book in the series. This is book is wonderful and is a must read for all Tamora Pierce and fantasy fans!"
4,Great Story Line!,"The book was exciting but the character wasn't as pronounced as Alanna was,(Lady Knight). My teen like the fact that she made friends with animals but wanted her to have more humans as friends. Because she likes the series so much she wants to read all of the books in it. Good book for any age, she says."
2,A. Wexler,"This material is a very short {67 pages} from a speech given at the poetry center NY, NY ..back in 1970. It is based on classic 'anarcho-syndicalist' thought, which the author makes no bones about. The likes of Von Humbolt and Rousseau are quoted {or misquoted} from which the author derives his own extrapolations. Unfortunately there are no prescriptions for how this 'perfect' society is to emerge.It is difficult to rate. Since it lacks a logical conclusion I have given it two stars, though it is a well written agitprop."
4,"Not his best work, but compelling nonetheless","Although not his most groundbreaking work, Chomsky's ""Government In The Future"" is a quick and interesting read. An edited transcription of a speech he made in 1970, it's ideas and complaints against capitalism and military economy are still extremely relevent. In addition to his timeless arguments, Chomsky also takes a moment to briefly spell out exactly what he means when he calls himself an anarchist, and then takes time to flesh out the four different kinds of government that we may see in the future, addressing counterarguments to ones he favors with such promptness that even Plato would have to appreciate.The only problem with this pamphlet is his massive reliance on other philosophers. While definately respectable in academic circles, his references to philosophers and thinkers of various stripes and centuries may alienate the casual reader.It's a quick read, though, and relatively easy to understand."
4,clean,great day scent. well worth the cash. very clean and slightly citrus with a hint of powder. sometimes you can find this at TJ Maxx for half price.
5,Rich History!,"""A Negro League Scrapbook"" paired with Sharon Robinson's ""Safe at Home"" would make a great gift for boys ages 10 - 16. Add a baseball glove and other gear and you are sure to score a home run with your loved one!The history in ""Scrapbook"" should be taught to our boys at school or in church -- please don't let this history die! ""Safe at Home"" has great insight into the thought processes of boys dealing with death, moving, peer pressure, bullies, teamwork, hard work, and perseverance. This would also be a great gift for a new teacher looking for high quality history and / or sports books. Enjoy!"
2,Not so water resistant or reliable,"While I liked the features for the price, including the hailer/loudspeaker function. I was dismayed to find that the interior of my display fogged up over about 2 years. After the warranty period had expired (by about a month with no ""grace period""), I found that repair (it lost the receive function on all but channel 16) would easily approach the cost of a new unit."
4,"""Corn"" Meant ""Wheat""!","In Old English ""corn"" meant ""grain"",mainly wheat in England, and oats in Scotland [Hard to grow hay in cool,damp Ireland}."
1,Throw it away!,"I enjoyed this book for a while. Until I read ""Cormac's Cup of Gold"". There I ran across the line ""Out on the plains of his royal meath, the green of the early corn waved to the breeze's patterns across the fields."" This line then made me angry. Why you might ask? Because from every history class I have ever had, corn is a New World crop and would not have been used or available to the Celts.If this mistake was made in a single sentence, what does it say for the scholarship that went into preparing and writing this book?"
2,Had to modify to work with my buckets.,I had to modify this bucket tool to work with the buckets I use. I used a rasp to slant the inner edges to accommodate my buckets. After alterations it works great.
1,Not even close,The piece of plastic won't even come close to taking off a plastic lid. Couldn't even get it under the lip. Very disappointed and sent it back right away.
1,The trees...the trees that died that this should live,I've read worse- wait. What am I saying. JUST WHAT AM I SAYING?!
1,Good Title,The title is the only thing I found in this book that was worth reading. I couldn't finish it.watziznaym@gmail.com
2,Bitter aftertaste makes this a no-go.,"Ive been trying a few different brands and blends of k-cups recently and this one is by far my least favorite. To compare, i have just finished a caribou blend box, a newmans organic dark roast box, etc. I tend to like a medium strength coffee and i find the darker roasts work better for me-i tried the tullys black with sugar, and immediatly got this burnt cigarette aftertaste- long time coffee drinkers know this taste-ugh. I havent gotten this aftertaste with the other brands. I tried the tullys again, with milk and sugar, which is my usual preparation-i thought this might mask that flavor, but i can still taste it. I am dissatisfied with this brand, and i wont buy it again, too much wasted money with the boxes being 10 bucks each."
5,Beyond liberation theology,"A life-changing book in my development as a convert to Catholicism. Few have ever demonstrated the inherent relevance of the Eucharist in the arena of ""worldly"" power politics. Cavanaugh revealed to me how Catholics need not look so much outside of doctrinal orthodoxy for a response to secular evils. Rather the transformative power of the Eucharist and the Liturgy is ever yet to be discovered, not just as succor for the soul but also for the nations."
3,Waaay out of date,"I guess I goofed when I ordered it. I'm a web designer and I should have known that the 1997 publish date would make this book essentially useless. The book, in 1997 terms, is just fine. The problem is, is that it's mainly good as a historical reference in 1999. I'm surprised it's in print. CSS is something we should all learn, but all the references to what might be coming in Internet Explorer 4 made me a little crazy. In 1997 this book should probably have 5 stars. In 1999, 3 is generous. MUCH more useful are the little CSS sections in HTML, The Definitive Guide, 3rd ed. (Musciano & Kennedy, from O'Reilly) and Web Design in a Nutshell (Jennifer Niederst, also O'Reilly). Sorry. I sent this one back to Amazon.com."
4,Great book but...,This is a great book but there is no CD that is advertised and the companion website no longer exsists. I try and make a point to buy computer books that come with one or the other or both. If someone knows of a new URL that accompanies this book please let me know.
5,bonheoffer,It was a very good film. Really enjoyed the background and history of Bonhoeffer. A very interesting person.
3,Worth Viewing -- would have liked broader historical context,"This was definitely worth viewing. However, I feel that it could have benefited from broader historical perspective, with more connections to the world at the time. Bonhoeffer was an important figure and his courage and grace is most appreciated against the backdrop of what the rest of German society in general and the religious community was doing in his time. The beliefs and actions of Bonhoeffer and people like him should be understood by all so that the it is known that even in the face of unimaginable evil there are heros."
4,"Factual account of an important theological figure, but...","Bonhoeffer's life is certainly worthy of popular examination. This DVD provides a factual account of many crossroads in his life, but does so with a feel reminiscent of classroom educational films of old. As a ""movie"" experience, it doesn't exhibit the excellence of, say, Ken Burn's Civil War series. Still, until someone makes a better documentary about Bonhoeffer, this one is the tops and so I give it four stars. I would encourage interested readers to review books by and about Dietrich Bonhoeffer to understand more fully the impact that this man had and why many regard him as a modern saint. And, no, I'm not Lutheran. d:c)"
1,Boring,"Informative but dry and boring.Had some interesting facts but was very slow paced,They sure could have made this a much better piece on an amazing man of that time."
2,Not As Accurate,I found a lot of inconsistencies in the information as I compared it with other study material on the matter. Big disappointment and waste of time and money. [...]
1,"good music, but very poor performance","If you listen to the Six Popular Paintings played by Manos Hadjidakis himself in another CD made by Greek EMI and Lyra records (the CD has a white cover, and includes also the ballet about the Serpent) you will realize that Kara has done a very poor job of interpreting Hadjidakis. Her version is boring and uninteresting, and is not fair to the composer in my opinion."
4,Space-Gard replacement filter easy to install,This product works very well doing just what the ad states. It is so easy to install compared to the older style accordian type. I would definately recommend this product to anyone tired of fighting with the other style filter.
3,Great idea!,"Although this is a great idea, the product doesn't seem particularly stable. I had trouble putting it together and figuring out which was what. Filter material looks uneven."
1,very bad product,"i must say though the product was shipped on time, it is awful using it.Not at all good for professional use, i had thought i will give a try with this new product and was completely dissatisfied. Very , very watery ,does not glide at all .Usually a 1 gallon massage lotion of any good kind would last at least upto 3 months , but the myossage lotion jar is almost empty in just about a months time.Will never buy or recommend it to anyone"
2,Fell short of its claims,"I have tried using the 1-1/2"" attachment several times now and have decided to just put it aside due to its incompetence. It doesn't cut my hair to 1-1/2"" length. I've tried running it thru my hair from various directions but it still wouldn't work. I even ran it thru slowly to give the pines a chance to raise my 3"" long hair to cut, but to no avail. I think it's probably due to the thin and fewer pines. It could probably use at least 2 more pines and stronger plastic to make it sturdier. As of now, it's practically useless. When I use it, it barely cuts any hair, but when I use the 1-1/4"" attachment it works like a charm. The difference between the two is 1/4""!! I hope they'd perfect this before long. The other Wahl attachments work just fine."
1,no good generator,bought a kipor 3000e 4 15 08 guit runing in less than 5 hr they gave me a rebuilt that never was right iam still trying to get something that works no luck
3,"The book is great for poetry lovers, otherwise it's okay.","The Essential Browning is a great book to read if you love poetry. If you don't it might get boring pretty fast. I like poetry enough to where I could keep going on, but it didn't all appeal to me to much. There are alot of poems in the book that I like, like ""Porphyria's Lover"" and ""My Last Duchess."" Those two poems are also two of Robert Browning's more famous poems. I think anybody can get into those two. I would reccomend this book to anybody who is really serious about poetry."
3,Great product but!!!,"Item works, but weapon fits to snug that when you draw it you end up pulling the holster with the weapon. I would prefer a Serpa holster over this for duty but for just a day at the range it works perfectly."
2,Siliver wrapped Cake boards,"I was really disappointed in this product. It was just small squares wrapped in the silver paper, I can wrap 4x4 boards myself. Not anything special for the amount of money I paid, and definitely not what I thought I was getting. The picture is not what you get either.. in my rush I didn't read the description well enough, that was my bad!! If you are looking for small tile size sliver paper cake board paper you can buy at Michaels for 9.00 a roll then you will be happy. I did get it very quickly."
4,Great book to learn the mechanics of Visual C++,"If you need to learn C++, then get a book on C++. If you need to Learn MFC, then Herbert Schildt's ""MFC From The Ground UP"" is an excellent book. This ""Teach Yourself Visual C++ 5 in 21 Days"" book is very good in showing you the mechanics of using the Application and Class Wizards in the Visual C++ compiler from Microsoft. This book is an excellent companion to Herbert Schildt's ""MFC From The Ground Up"". Learning MFC is the way to go, do not waste time with the old way of programming windows (SDK using Windows API)"
1,"What a useless, boring...book...","When I first read this book, I nearly fell asleep. How can it be so boring? Everyday chapter is just a long description for pushing the button in the Wizard. And it was repeated and repeated again. Definitely, you can learn how to use the Wizard instead of how to program with Visual C++. It never tells you why you have to do it. Very little explaination on COM, Database, web program, etc. I regret to waste my time on this book."
2,"So many pages, so little content","I'm an experienced DOS C programmer, and I needed a book to help jumpstart me into Win 95 programming. I skimmed through the contents and thought, ""Great, it contains what I want to learn!"".Until I started reading the damned thing, that is. It's not so much the subject matter, as it is the lack of depth which is the problem. The author spends far too much explaining the same stupid steps (""Click here, and here, and here, etc"") over and over without going into any relevant detail. The examples are painfully primitive, and trying to create apps with any sort of functionality resulted in lots of fishing in the MSDN Library.If you're an absolute beginner to Visual C++, then this book will give you a good feel for the basics. Unfortunately, that's about all it contains."
1,You can find better than this,"When I first saw this book i thought it was great. The begin was easy : Many pictures, all the required steps etc... But when I finished it, I reallised that the best thing I could do was making nice looking windows. I didn 't learn to program in C just draw windows, show MessageBoxes, meaby make a sound (BEEP). The book could be one third in size and give the same amount of info."
2,An alarming lack of information,"This book is great at teaching you the INTERFACE of Visual C++, but explains little about the functions used in the example programs. I have an advantage in that I am a programmer by profession and am familiar with many of the concepts shown (but not explained) in the book. What I was able to reason on my own because of lack of information, someone with less experience might not."
3,"A good book for beginners, without a lot of the technical.","This book is ideal for people who either knowlittle about Visual C++, or for people whoneed to get a program out fast. It is veryeasy to follow, with helpful hints andexamples, along with questions at the end ofeach chapter. However, this book lacks thetechnical side needed by most, and should becomplemented with another book,specificallyof a reference style. Overall, it is a goodbook to own if you want to start to learn VisualC++."
1,Not very informative,All this book does is tell you what to click/type to make a few things that you will never need to do happen. It doesn't even explain basic variables and program control structures until the appendix. The author does not stop to explain the parameters passed to various equations and does not even touch TCP/IP.I can't really think of anything good to say about this book.
2,"Repeating, repeating, repeating...","You will not learn C++ with this book, you will learn what buttons to press in Visual C++ to make different things show up. Nothing wrong with that, becaues the title says it's Visual C++ it's about.However, instead of showing what buttons to press in the ClassWizard once, the same 5-pages guide is everywhere, with EVERY example! Sources codes are repeated over and over again in the book. And even text about certain functions/features are repeated (not just part of it) whenever something similar is used in another example.This book could easily become 1/4 of it's current size if the author didn't pressed copy/paste so many times. It seems that the main goal of the book is to be as large as possible (as many pages as possible). Maybe that's what authors get paid for?"
3,"Taste great, but not so filling.","This is a good book for the person just starting out with VC++ 5, however, it leaves you wanting more. It does not teach you much about programming with C++. It would be nice if the authors had given more explanations for the programs."
2,it didn't help me much,i programming in c++ and i am looking for a book to help me understand this new staff about visual programming with visual c++. This book didn't explain to me anything but just give some example with no practical use .
3,,"the book itself is great. i did not encounter a single mistake from the book. The examples found in the book are also very impressive. BUT, this book does not teach you well on HOW TO PROGRAM. its more of a click-click-click-compile tutor. It does not explain how the language itself works such as MFC(or at least not enough) but rather on how to use the MSVC's environment tools, such as application wizards and etc. I did enjoy reading the book however, I don't think I've learned a whole lot either."
2,"Only ""How"", No ""Why""!","I agree with some readers, this book relies too much on the Wizards,FEW CONCEPTS/PRINCIPLES are explained. I finished all the samples in the book as instructed by this book, but I got nothing after finishing this book.This book should be titled as ""Experence MFC in 21 Days""."
3,Pre-packaged examples,This is a good book if one wants to jump straight into building programs with Visual C++. But one does not really learn to program using Visual C++ (which is a lot more complex than the author makes it out to be) other than the specific examples covered.
2,"Good start, but repetetive and ignores importatn details","While the book is a nice intro to some of the concepts of of VC++5, it relies far too heavily on the wizards and does not focus enough on some very important elements in Windows programming. It will spend three pages explaining the minuatae of attaching code to a check box and then repeat the same exact instructions for EVERY check box on the screen, rather than saying, ""repeat this process for each box on the screen."" It even explains the CONCEPT in full for each check box. However, it will use the word 'pointer' or 'class' with almost no explanation. It would be very helpful to go into greater detail about some of the more basic elements of program design and basic C++ concepts like classes, structures, pointers, etc. After the First day, I found myself turning the pages three or four at a time due the incredible redundancy in simple explanations."
4,"Has taught me quite a bit, but I want to know more.","I have worked through a good deal of this book, and I can recommend it highly. The authors deftly teach the reader how to navigate through the VC++ 5 IDE, and a good deal about the syntax and vocabulary of the VC++ language. Yet, I want to know more about C++ classes; exactly what are they and how do they work, and exaclty what is going on behind the scenes? It could be said that that topic is beyond the scope of a beginner's book, but I believe that knowing more of the real fundamentals would aid in the learning of the rest. Don't get me wrong, I like this book, and if you want to learn MS VC++ 5, this book will be all you need to get started in this complex and fascinating language."
4,A good strting point for novice to beginners,"If you know something about object oriented languages or simple C and C++, this is a good book to start programming in Windows.Since the book tries to cover big ground in short 21 chapters, is not a good reference for those who already know how to use MFC, and want to improve their knowledge on Visual C++."
4,Great Acting - A joy to watch,"This is a great film but I feel the story line could of been a bit stronger. I love the cast which includes Mare Winningham, one of my favorites. The times were hard, it is a rough around the edges type of movie with a great ending. The acting is the best especially the parts played by the children.Diane"
2,Disappointing acting and writing,"I was disappointed in the acting and the writing in this film. The basic story is not bad but it is poorly supported by the acting and, especially, by the writing. It could be a much better film."
4,"Elijah W. is amazing in ""The War""!","Elijah Wood is protraying his best character he has ever done, His emotions are very real and he seems like he real is Stu. I cannot even belive that he is from Iowa and not from Texas. That is one of the reasons why I love EW and I want to marry him.But I think that Kevin Costner could have done a better job. He was as good as Elijah Wood or the actress who did the mom. It would have been better if Mel Gibson did the father.But I belive that Elijah Wood was the biggest and best actor in the entire movie."
5,The War,"I rented this first of all for Kevin Costner, but was surprised after watching why you never heard more about this movie, It was fantastic! Every actor and actress did great jobs, but both Elijah Wood and Kevin Costner stood out. It never really had a certain plot but yet it did in the fact that it focused on war from three sides....The real war Costner went through....The war the children fought to try and fit in.....and the war that everyone of us fight inside ourselves. If you don't walk away from this movie with a twing inside something is missing. I would highly recommend this for the whole family to watch and learn from. And yes I cried at the end."
3,"Entertaining, but Uneven","When I decided to watch ""The War"" when it was on ABC a few months ago, I have to say I had very high hopes for it. With such a talented cast, and a storyline full of dramatic promise, I was expecting something brilliant. I didn't get it. To be fair, ""The War"" does have several things going for it, including a talented cast turning in socko performances, and a handful of truly magical moments. However, on the whole, the film seems to lack a basic message. Is this movie about the evil of war, the need for people to get along, faith in the American dream, the bond between a family, or tolerence of people different from you? The film sort of jumps from one to the other, not really giving any of them enough time to make much of an impact on the audience. While not at all bad, ""The War"" will always be the kind of movie where one will think of what could have been."
1,The War {HD DVD},"I do not have a hd dvd player to play this movie on, could you please swap it for a regular Dvd movie.I will send back the two movies you sent me."
1,The War,I could not play the movie on any of my dvd players because it was HD dvd. I thought it was blue ray.
2,R..... not PG,"This movie is rated PG; yet I was not able to show this movie to my kids. I know that the world is full of aggression, however how can I sit with my family and watch a movie with so much violence between kids. Some will tell me that it is good to expose children to such violence and possibly reality of life and the human beings among each other. I totally disagree.This movie should be rated R and not PG2 stars, only because of the great acting; the story is basic, about a father feeling awful for leaving his best buddy behind during the Vietnam War while his kids are fighting other children over a tree hut. I know I am probably going to bombarded with bad feedbacks however this is my honest opinion about this movie.(Have you ever noticed that when someone writes a review that doesn't give the artist 4 or 5 stars - the reviewer gets slammed in the votes?)"
5,"Great Movie, Overlooked","This is a great movie, with wonderful characters and acting! I've watched it several times and have shared it with many friends and family. It reminds me of my childhood."
5,Super story with lots of humor and interest,This is one of my favorite movies....We watch it over and over and never get tired of it. A great story is told along with some interesting characters and lots of humor. A family favorite.
4,Great!,My wife wanted this so bad since she laughed so hard the first time she watched it. We have since transfered the info to a DVD to save the VHS quality.
2,Not the BEST movie ever but it deserves some credit,"Give this movie a chance. I just saw it yesterday and decided to look up some stuff in the internet and i found that most people out there don't like it. Well, I did like it... Not love it, but liked it. It's one of those movies that you'd want to see when you're bored. Well, our two heroes were'nt that much good actors but they were kinda funny to me. And although the story didn't have much substance, the characters themselves kept you laughing or crying...whatever. Anyway, I suggest you watch it one time but will guarantee no promise that you'd like it as much as I did.Also, I'd like to give a shout-out to my peeps!"
1,Misread,Thought it was in English turns out its in Italian. :( so of course we couldn't watch it. Next time I need to read the info better.
5,A Must Have for My DVD Collection!!!,"I am so happy to hear that I am not insane and other people like this movie as well. This was my favorite movie growing up and still is in my personal top ten! It is a hilarious movie about two barely audible barbarians who fall into the classic fantasy adventure! Being a huge fantasy fan I must say that if you have not seen it, it is deffinately worth the time to watch. I promise you will not regret it!!!"
3,Pinzon Diamond Glasses,The glasses as a whole were beautiful and just as I expected. One of the large glasses was chipped and I had to throw it away.
2,not for me,I love The Firm products so I couldn't resist giving this a try. It was too fast paced for me and would move on to the next move without a moment to realize what was happening. You spend so long catching up that you're not getting the benefits of the workout. I can always keep up with the previous workouts from The Firm so I'm guessing it's not just me.
2,the firm,I'm sure this is a good product.But as a beginner and have been doing many others. I feel this might be a little difficult for beginners. Went at to fast of pace to learn.
1,Not the original firm ! Bought out by sorry Gaiam huge corporation,"I have been doing the Firm workout for 15 years. I ordered one of these express. One!! They sent me nine. When I called, they were stubborn and made me pay postage to send those boxes back that I did not order. Plus they were very use pathetic. I did research and realized the original Firm has nothing to do with the old. It is now owned by Gaaiam. The choreography is not half as good nor are the workouts.If you are ordering Firm workouts you need to get the older ones before Gaiam bought them out. They just use the name. Ideally dislike this corporation and will refuse to purchase anything with their name on it. beware!"
1,Boring!,"I have been working out regularly for 10 years and am in great shape. I work out at the gym and do exercise videos regularly for fun variation. I received this set as a birthday gift. The workouts WILL get your blood pumping and provide a good workout, but this has got to be the most boring workout series EVER! The instructors are annoying and the routines don't capture the interest at all. It is my experience that if a workout is not fun or interesting, it stays on the shelf. That's where The Firm is now. Try Hip Hop Abs or The Biggest Loser series instead...fun, challenging, and effective!"
2,Nice!,"So far so good! I can't say I lost any weight yet,only time will tell,and it's nice for a very good workout!"
2,Needs more direction,You have to be in good shape just to do this video. The movements are quick and the warm up is minimal. Unless you preview the video you will not be able to perform the movements with proper form. I would have liked a written description of the movements to read before viewing and doing the workout.
5,Great workout!,"I get to the gym once a week. I work full time and have two kids. This is GREAT for busy moms. Who cant devote 20 minutes 3 times a week? I do them 3 days in a row, which is not what is recommended but is what works for my schedule. The coordiantion and routines may take a few times to get,but i see and feel results. I have been doing this for over a month now and have lost 2 pounds, and I know the reason I have not lost more is the way I'm eating. There is not a lot of time for warm up or technique, but you will learn it. In 20 minutes, my expectations were not high but they exceeded them! Its a good workout!"
1,The Firm Express - only for prior firm users,I loved the infomercial and was hooked from the first day. I purchased this with great enthusiasm. Too bad there is no way to keep up with these ladies. Week one was ok but after that there is no way to be able to do what they want in the short amount of time. Really dissapointed. Not worth it at all.
1,Not Good,"They jump in too fast with the moves, once you learn it they are already moving in to the next move. It also just starts out way too fast, I feel like there is no warm up which I think is extremely important. I would not recommend this set of work outs for anyone."
1,Disappointing rip-off from Gaiam,"I own a great deal of the Firm DVDs and have generally been happy with the program and company. But when I received the package, despite the box being sealed and Amazon's great packing, the discs had fallen out of the sleeves they were in (they were not properly secured or wrapped) and were scratched. This is the company's poor packaging/design. Even so, approximately 1/2 the discs were the same one's Giaim has packaged and sold as other DVDs (i.e., Turbocharge Weight Loss and Ignite Calorie Burn), which I already have. Definitely NOT worth the $ and VERY disappointed in false advertising and poor packaging!!!! I am returning this!"
1,Not for advanced,"I bought this product thinking it would deliver the results they are saying but nope!! I consider myself an intermediate, advanced and it is not what I expected. They are too short in my opinion plus their 8 second MINI bursts are not enough to get my heart rate up, not even half way., I w/o 6 days a week for around one hour or more and obviously had to stack 3 or 4 in order to get a good sweat. So if you're an advanced, there's no way you'll be satisfied with this pack. Would NOT recommend."
1,No Returns,Buy the Firm Express System only if you never want your money back.....They will take the product back but not return your money and they keep charging your account every month.....
1,No Rating Yet - Just Ordered These,"My set is on the way. I do normally love The Firm products, so I am not worried, except I do needto burn plenty of calories in my workouts.I am wondering if any reviewers have indeed lost 15 pounds in 30 days like the infomercial claims?"
4,Worked Well For Me,I lost 15 lbs the first time I did the program. I will say that I followed the meal plan reasonably closely as well. My main criticism is that you don't have time to learn one move before you're on to something else. My first go 'round the workouts were really 40 minutes as opposed to 20 minutes because I decided to watch the videos 1st then try and follow along. I loved that the actual workouts are short though. Really good for those short on time.
4,So Far So Good,"OK, I completed the IGNITE portion of this series with Emily and boy do I break a sweat. The 3rd Cardio & Sculpt DVD is basically part of the IGNITE CALORIE BURN DVD, so when I get to the ACCELERATE with Rebekah, I'll know what to expect."
5,The Firm express--Well done,"I have always been a big fan of the firm.I started going to classes in Columbia,sc the 80's, and got into great shape.I used the early videos, and they were great. The Firm express is no exception.The workouts are well done,and really work you out.The instructors give clear directions, and are motivating to watch.They enjoy the workouts too. I just finished the series, and have started over.The workouts do move fast,so if you are not used to this,just pause and practice the moves a couple of times to get your form right. /The burst concept does really get your heartrate up, and it feels great when your done. The Fitness guide is informative. I would recommend taking measurements before starting. I have lost only 4lbs,but have shed a at least an inch or so. I would recommend this kit."
4,Now this is a workout!,"I've been working out for more than 20 years, and I have to admit this program kicks my behind! I've done P90 in the recent past, and it was a good workout, but it was an hour long and it got boring to me after a while. But I never got the workout that I get with The Firm Express. I can feel every muscle in my body after I'm done. I like the fact that there are 12 different routines, but I agree with other reviewers that it is a little difficult to follow the first couple of times through each one, and this is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But the 20 minutes are over before I know it, and I can tell I've done something! (I only wish I had gotten it off Amazon instead of late-night TV; I would've saved about $40!)"
1,High expectations for the underfitted,"This product is fast, short and to the point. However if you aren't already in good shape it's very difficult to keep up. It goes so fast that you can't learn the steps before it quickly changes the routine. I did the firm back in the 90's it was wonderful and I wasn't in shape. They should come up with a firm pilates mix that way you build up the core and get fast results with instruction."
4,Great workout!,"Many years ago I did the Firm video workouts with the different steppers and weights. But I just don't have time to workout for an hour anymore, so haven't done them in quite awhile. I decided to check and see if they had anything shorter, and I found these. I was always intrigued because I get so bored when I exercise, so I liked that it was a different video every time you workout for a month. I have just finished week 3, and I have to say these are great workouts! I'm 56 years old and would like to loose about 30 lbs, so I'm not as young as many people who might want to do these. I work as hard as I can, and keep reminding myself that it is only 20 minutes -- I can do anything for 20 minutes, and I just keep going! If you are coordinated and like a fast-paced workout, you will enjoy this!"
5,Buy this now!,"The absolute BEST home workout system I've tried. Doesn't require a bunch of equipment taking up space (just a few dumbells) and only takes 20 minutes! Sounds too good to be true but I swear I get a great workout with this...it really kicks my butt. I was tired of spending over an hour with my other workout DVDs, I was dreading doing them. And I felt like I was wasting time with all the stretching and breathing. Just wanted to get it done and start my day. I lost 10 pounds which was my goal. These are not easy but if you stick with it, it gets a little easier as time goes on. If say if you are more than 50 lbs overweight you may want to try something else first as there is a LOT of jumping involved. Im 120lbs and even i feel like im gonna break through my living room floor. But i really love this workout, totally worth what it costs."
1,This is rubbish!!!!!!!!!,"The Firm gets a complete zero. I could not follow the instructor; no, not even a little. Who on earth did they make this for? If you are a Firm fan do not purchase as you will be greatly disappointed!! I have many of their DVDs on my shelf & have appreciated their style, instruction & most importantly, results ( past)."
2,they should warn you.......,"Because this was a 12-dvd set, I assumed you were eased into this program---which really sounded great on TV. NOT SO! I would NOT recommend this exercise program for women over 50. I injured myself just on the first lesson!Some great exercises, but the intensity was just too much right out of the shoot. I returned the program sore and quite disappointed."
2,Overly choreographed warm ups,"These could be good, I used my HRM during the first 6 videos and on avg burn 200 calories in 20 minutes. That's nice, but not any more impressive than doing Core Rhythms 20 minute video. Moved onto the third week and just cannot master the overly choreographed warm up, she's got you twisting, turning and kicking. And when I couldn't master it before she moved onto some other twisting, turning and kicking move I just got frustrated and turned the dang thing off after 3 minutes. If only the Firm website would allow feedback. They need to put out a tutorial video to go along with these. Even Core Rhythms was smart enough to do that."
2,Not like the Firm used to be,"These videos stick to the 20 minutes, but the workouts are not enough to get ""thin in 30 days."" Nothing like the traditional Firm workouts. Some of the movements are too fast and could cause injury when combined with weights. I would suggest Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30 workouts for a shorter, effective, kick-butt workout."
2,"ok, but not quite suited for me.","This is a great idea, however kinda complex for beginners. I consider myself a moderate exercisor, but high impact is very difficult for me with bad knees. I needed something low to med impact. The set is pretty advanced, lots of footwork to keep it all straight. I do like the way the dvds are set up week by week which is good."
3,The Firm Express,"The concept in itself is good. But the amount of jumping is not for someone who is just beginning to exercise. I realize they put someone in the video who does alternate steps, but there is still quite a bit of aerobic movement. The best advice is to watch each video through since the routines are done at a fast pace."
2,Not the Firm I grew up with,"I've been using Firm tapes and now dvds for years. This set is almost on the verge of ridiculous for anyone over the age of 35. It's too fast, too strenuous, not enough info on how to do something, and I must say, unsafe. I'm 54. Not grandmom 54, work out daily 54. Even I can't use these anymore. I kept them too long, trying my best to enjoy at least 1 of the set, or I'd have returned them sooner and gotten my money back. I""m sorry to say that's the last Firm dvd I'll buy. You've missed the mark. The age people you're tailoring this to don't have to work out on a regular basis. My age person does. I lent them to younger and older than me, and others my age. No one enjoyed these. I'm disappointed and wanted you to know."
2,Not worth the high dollar tag,"I purchased The Firm- Express after spending a month doing Jillian Michael's Ripped in 30.(that dvd cost $9.99)I actually enjoyed Jillian much better and felt that I got a better workout. The Firm has too many choreographed moves coming at you too fast. Sure, it looks pretty but the average person can't keep up and get the moves correct to maximize the workout and prevent injury. I pulled something in my knees twice trying to copy their 90 mile an hour moves. A lot of the time, I had to just march in place. Since you only use each dvd once, you can't learn the move. And their diet info is very standard. This info is everywhere. The program would be better if it was less expensive, had fewer dvds that you could repeat and learn the routines, and the routines don't have to be this complicated! Jillian's dvd has 4 routines on one. Want to buy my copy?"
3,Not quite what I expected,"I just finished the Firm Express workout program. I was really excited about doing it. I had seen the infomercials about it and it looked fun and fast. This is a four week program that's supposed to get you in shape in that time.The best thing about the program is that every workout is only 20 minutes. So, if you don't have a lot of time, it will work for you.The bad part about it is that each workout is only done once. So, you never get comfortable with a workout. You do it once and then move on. I struggled with the moves because of this.Other than that, I enjoyed the fast pace of the program. But, I felt that the 20 minutes and the fact that you only did each workout once actually reduced my fitness level. I'm going to give it another shot and redo the program to see if it works out better for me the second time around because I'll know the moves better."
4,Good results in 20 minutes,"It's pretty motivating to work out when you only have to do it 20 minutes 3 times a week. I paired the Firm Express with weight watchers and lost 10 pounds in 3 months (now at my goal weight). I followed the recommended weekly workout plan and added the 10 minute kickstart workout 2/3 times during the week. After I finished the first month of workouts, I did the Flat Belly workout which is 4 days of 40-60 minute workouts. I definitely saw results with that. As mentioned by others, the moves can be a little tricky but it made me pay attention and work harder. I think I enjoyed the cardio workouts the most which is unusual for me. In the past, I've been a fan of the Firm sculpting workouts. My only complaint about this workout is that there are so many DVDs, seems like they could have put more than one workout on a DVD. I would recommend this workout to anyone who is crunched for time, I think it's worth the money."
5,THIS WORKS!!!!!,"I have way too many workout DVDs. Some are really good, and some are too long. I talk myself out of doing it if it's too long. This program is the most amazing one I've ever bought in 15 years of a hamster wheel. I played around with the 13 workouts for a few weeks, and then settled on my own system. I do the cardio plus sculpt DVD's one day (40 mins), and the cardio-sculpt DVD the next day (20 mins). In other words, every other day I do 40 and 20 mins. So it takes 8 days to get through the whole cycle. The results are insane. I've lost 12 pounds in three weeks. But I've also used the recipes in the booklet that comes with the program. And I love the music and the instructors. I love this product."
1,Frustrating!,"I am very disappointed with this program. Ok I don't have much co-ordination, but I found even the first DVD in the series to be impossible to follow! I watched the DVD a few times before attempting it but I still couldn't keep up and I ended up doing 'half moves', which felt like they were having no effect. I also felt that I could easily pull or strain something. In the instructions they stress that form is very important, but you are not given any time to check it.Also, the way the program works is that you only do each DVD once in 30 days, which doesn't give you any chance to learn the routines.I'm going back to my other fitness DVDs"
4,Great for exercise ADD,"I am a stay at home mom of little ones and the fact that each workout is only twenty minutes is perfect for me. I also say that I have exercise ADD and can't do the same workout over and over again, so the fact that there are 13 dvds each with a different workout is awesome. I don't like one of the coaches, but that is my ONLY complaint. All in all a good purchase for me."
2,Buy a different workout,"I read these reviews before I purchased this kit, but I thought the other reviews were probably from people who weren't in good shape. Well, now, I know why these workouts are free on hulu and the infomercial isn't on TV anymore. They lack sufficient warm-up, provide very little form instruction which could easily lead to injury, and are just generally ill-conceived. I was very disappointed. Save your money and buy something else."
3,"OK, but not the best that the Firm has to offer","I've been using the Firm workouts since 1999 and have loved them, both because they work for me, and because they are safe and use good form. Because Express uses these short bursts that are supposed to maximize fat burning and save time, there isn't enough time to learn the sequences. Form is sacrificed for speed. The workouts have been a bit hard on my back and knees. I would caution beginners to think twice before purchasing this set. Although more time consuming, I find the Transfirmer system to be excellent, as well as Hi Def Sculpt, Cardio Dance Fusion, and Cardio Overdrive."
3,Good attempt,One of the reasons I gave this a try was I thought their had to be something besides MS Office. My main complaint is the email handler seems to be an after thought. Tried to use it with my cable modem and it gets very confused on both the desktop PC and the notebook (doesn't work). I'd have to say the best bang for the buck is still StarOffice.
2,Wordperfect 10 (Office 2002),"Although it fixes several of the problems from 6.1, it has 2 major flaws:1. The file open, save, etc. dialogs take an interminable amount of time to open.2. For some bizarre reason, Corel dropped the Quicklist feature for the file open, save, etc. dialogs. The option of using the ""favorites"" folder is stupid--to make it work, I would have to delete all of my IE 5.0 web sites."
1,WordPerfect Office 2002,"Although WP Office 2002 probably represents a significant upgrade with many new features and added stability, potential users should consider before purchase that WP Office may not be uniformly compatible with Windows 2000, depending on operating suystem and hardware configuration. After successfuly installing, the WordPerfect component of Office 2002 might not run.Corel is expected to release a patch or solution."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is the worst WordPerfect I have ever owned. I have used 5 previous versions of WordPerfect, none of which were as slow or as troublesome as this version. I spent an hour on the phone with a tech rep in Canada, after which the system ran worse than ever. Corel does not have an 800 number so you must foot the bill yourself. I have just ordered Microsoft Office XP and when it arrives, I will un-install WordPerfect 2002."
3,deserves consideration: not knee-jerk liberal reaction,"the research in this book might be flawed: but consider the premise- if cultural and technological progress happens in spurts of growth-then why shouldn't 1400-1900 Europe just happen to have the greatest concentration of accomplishment? This is not a racist thesis. If accomplishment in arts and science is unevenly distributed, some places and times will see greater concentrations. I find it refreshing that he doesn't make some argument for the US as the center of cultural advancement. Deserves serious thought."
5,Beautiful Poems,"Whispers of Poetry: Light and Easy Poetry for Everyday People About Everyday Adventures.I liked this book because it has poems for all kinds of moods, they are easy reading and the English language is beautifully written.I specially enjoy ""Ageless"" and ""The Greatest Adventure"""
5,Awesome,"I really liked the poems. We were assigned to read two for a class project and I ended up buying the book. Theres a poem in the book for everyone, something everyone can relate to."
3,Veiws on Poetry,"I loved the poem ""Poetry"". It's a short rhyming poem about how poetry doesn't have to conform to any sort of format or style. The fact is that any writing in verse can be considered poetry, and that everyones ideas on poetry differ slighty.""Because You're You"" is an amazing work that makes me think of people that I hold dear. I think about my girlfriend and how she always makes me feel better with just the simplist things."
1,Simple poetry for the Simple person,This book is full of simple poetry that anyone can read. It doesn't really interest me in any way. I am not an avid poetry reader but this book does not interest me.
4,Whispers of Poetry by Fay Hope Cusick,"Whispers of Poetry, by Fay Hope Cusick; Is an enjoyable book. I purchased this book of Poetry for projects at school, after reading some of the poems in this book, I realized I do like poetry. One paricular poem, "" I Wonder,"" talks about when someone's loved one fell out of love and she wonders when it happened. I relatedto this poem. ""The Not To Be Queen,"" was about Princess Diana and where she is Queen of an Island. I've always enjoyed reading about Princess Diana."
1,Lifeless as a dead tree.,"Photos are uninspiring, if not misleading. All the trees pictured resemble twigs thrown between undefined rocks with no thought to shape, movement, intent or design.Content wise, misdirection and vagueness are the only quality offered. The reader will learn very little, and what they may learn isn't correct.You will find much better, thorough, and true information online visiting Bonsai Forums.Walk away from the monitor. Do NOT buy this book."
3,Serves purpose--needs better battery/cord compartment design,"The iBoom has acceptable sound--good enough for a hotel room or a camper. The volume can be fairly loud but it sounds poor when turned to the maximum volume.Reception of FM stations in my area is quite good.I agree with a prior reviewer about the battery/electrical cord compartment design. It's the biggest drawback of this unit. The electrical cord will not detach and it must be tucked tightly into the back of the battery compartment before you can insert the batteries. If you need to use the electrical cord, the batteries must be removed to access it."
2,Not well developed,I was very excited when I ordered the iboom for Christmas but disappointed when it arrived.My main problem is the power cable and battery area. The power cable should be detachable and there shoud be a car adapter available. The power cable gets in the way when you decide to use batteries. This IS a BIG problem. The cable should either tuck away neetly or be removeable.The iboom doesn't take advantage of the dock connector! When docked. the iPod shoud be controlled be the iBoom's controls but isn't.
3,Worth the price.....,"If you get it for 60 bucks like I did. I bought mine at Target on the clearance rack for 59.99 & for that price I am quite happy. The machine is cheaply made but it gets the job done, it lets me listen to my 5g 30gb Ipod on the go. I could not imagine paying 150 dollars for this but at 60 dollars I could not pass it up. I paid 35 dollars for my Ipod case & 50 dollars for the Apple Remote so 60 is quite good......If you can get it for 70 dollars or lower go for it, anything over that is too steep. The product is just not that well crafted to justify paying any more than 70 bucks."
3,"DLO iBoom, Great for on the go tunes!","It is not the greatest stereo, but it has okay sound. The best part is its portability, and the fact it acts as a charger for the iPOD. Not a bad purchase for a $100 boombox."
2,Not for Office Use,"Like many other reviewers, I bought this unit with the intent of being able to play my ipod softly while working. However, there is not ""soft"" volume on this at all. If you're in a quiet office, it is much too loud to even turn on.Everything else about the iBoom is good. I am happy with it and will be able to use it in my bathroom while getting ready for work.But if you're looking only for something for the office, do not buy this, look for alternatives."
2,Not quite what I thought,"I thought this would be great to have in my office and to take with me when I travel, however the volume on the iBoom does not work properly. If you try and turn it down you get nothing, you try to turn it up just a little, it's loud. I returned one thinking the volume control was defective but the second one was the same way. If you don't need to have the volume on low, you would be happy with it, if you do, you won't be that pleased."
4,iBoom Crazy!!,i really like the iboom alot it gets really loud and i love how it recharges my ipod while im listening to my music on it!
2,Looks better than it is,"Got this so I could use my iPod at the office. Was looking for speakers but also something that charged the unit. This appealed to me because it also have a radio built in. Dragged it into work today and the volume control stinks. It seems to have have 2 settings, a little too loud or just too soft. Perhaps it would be better in a home setting where volume levels aren't as important.You'd be better off with a nice pair of speakers and a docking station to keep your iPod charged.I'm probably sending this back. If you are going to invest in something, check it out in a store first and pay the extra money for a better system."
1,"What a "" RIPPOFF"" for the $$$$","This "" BOOM BOX "" Can hardly plug in less Play Music ! ~ This Junk~in a ~Box, Boom Box Sounds Like you have a Bag over your Head and Ear Plug's In !! Go with the (BOSE SOUNDDOCK), If you payed for an IPOD~You Love GOOD Sound & GOOD MUSIC ~ So the Bose SoundDock is a bit $ But LOOK ! It's, BOSE and it will KICK out the Sound & Base you Wont for the Size !!! You wont need to buy a New One for YEAR's !!!! ""Buy The Best, Buy BOSE""."
3,boombox,its nice for carrying around and moving frequently but it doesnt have the best sound quality.
2,Not a good product,"I purchased this to have a stereo for my iPod for primary use in my office, but to take with me other places. I have the 30 gig Video ipod - it fits loosly. The entire system seems cheaply made. As I mentioned, I wanted to use it in my office - well, at the lowest volume control, it is not very quite, so I would annoy my co-workers if I turned it on. Bottom line - Save your money!!!"
1,Beware -- can't be used with iPod photo,"Beware with this iBoom box -- even though the vendor says it ""works with all 3G, 4G, iPod mini and iPod+HP with dock connector"" -- not true. The iPod photo does not fit in this unit. For me, back to the store it went. Also, for $150.00, it seemed kind of flimsy and cheaply manufactured."
3,A $35 Boom Box for $85,Has anyone noticed that EVERYTHING for IPOD is overpriced? I bought the Iboom to play while I'm at the skate park. So I was concerned that it play the music loud enough. It's true that the sound goes from off to loud quickly. Don't buy this for office use. And that annoying hum (probably the amplifier) is there. But the Iboom delivered 100 decibels of music before it began to distort. I don't think the Altec Lansing inMotion can compete with its meager 4 watts of power vs. the Iboom's 20 watts per speaker. So for me the Iboom is an OK buy.
4,Happy,The I-Boom has great sound for the price and size. My only complaint is that there is not good resolution at low volume levels.
1,returned for something better (avoid),"you get what you pay for... even less in this case. Ipods(of all sizes) don't fit correctly without shimming one side in order to get speaker output from both sides. Also, the fm reciever is weak and there is no antenna to fine tune reception.Please avoid... this product is not worth the money"
5,I recomend this book to many people,This a incredible fun filled book and is one of the many great books that I have read in the last few months and I was suprised that no one had reviewed such a great book and I highly recommend this book to any reader . This is a book about a group of sea creaturess a lobster a crab a fish and a star fish and all their friends who help them in the many encounters they have trying to scavenge materials for their under water garden .
4,Enjoyable,"I saw this show years ago on PBS and remembered enjoying it very much. Theodore Bikel is one of my favorite actor/singers. He acts as host, telling the story of Passover as well as singing a few songs. As with most holidays, there aren't a great many different songs for the holiday, but the various ways in which ""Dayenu"" is presented, are wonderful. The modern take on ""Dayenu"" sung in the style of Paul Anka's ""Diana"" was great. There were also some Ladino songs, not as well known to most Ashkenazim. The older woman giving a cooking lesson on matzo balls is a kick.This show is pretty much a companion piece to PBS's ""A Taste of Chanukah."" In that one you get songs and a latke cooking lesson.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was just a little slow moving. Entertaining, but slow. By the way, I am not Jewish. You don't have to be to enjoy a concert."
1,HORRIBLE,"Sent this as a gift.. can't hear ANY water sound, size was NOT the size listed(12x12x11)is was 7x6 1/4! Looks like something sent from a dollar store.Waited over 2 weeks for this!Would Not suggest to anyone."
1,FunkyMonkey,"I'm sorry...I wanted so much to love this raw, vegan snack bar and give it a positive review. I do love all its ingredients but this concoction tastes just like soap to me. Maybe the other flavors are more palatable and I may venture to try them if I ever get through this case of cacao cookie. Maybe Chef Ani just needs to tweak this particular recipe."
3,"Unless you weigh 90 lbs, expect to have to cut off the end seams.","The tights are thick and stretchy, perfect for a dance piece, but too much like a plastic bag for daily wear. The sizing of the tights was not accurately described, Max weight is more 90 lbs. rather than the 160 lbs. is says on the package, and forget it if you wear anything but a size S or XS in underpants.I cut off the end seams, which I expected to have to do since I am quite tall, and I they will look great in my ballet part."
2,Disappointing,"I searched quite awhile before selecting this toaster, based on appearance and brand. It is cute, and looks nice on the counter, but it is a lousy toaster!! The bread has to be turned halfway through or it will burn on the lower part while barely browning the upper part. Also, it does not raise the bread high enough to remove without lifting the lever manually. Overall I am very disappointed and would return it if I had not thrown out the box already."
3,Not the quality I was expecting,Works fine but has a cheap feel about it. Isn't the quality I was expecting from a T-fal product.
1,Horrible,"Let me sum this up for you in one word: bootleg. The quality is so poor it is virtually unwatchable. I am mainly talking about the audio portion. It sounds like you are listening to an old cassette player. There is hardly any sound coming out of the left channel and the right channel sounds horrid. The video quality is slightly below average. I am mainly pissed off because of the audio. Even if you are a diehard F&J; fan, I'm not sure it's worth buying this.Audio: 1 out of 5Video: 2.5 out of 5"
