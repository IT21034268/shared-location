4,YOU GO ALICIA!!,"THIS ALBUM IS GREAT, ALICIA HAS A BUEATIFUL STRONG VOICE, AND AWESOME PAINO SKILLS. NOT ONLY DOES SHE SING AND PLAY HER OWN INSTRAMENT SHE WRITES THE SONGS TOO!! ALICIA IS VERY TALENTED AND SHE SHINES IN THIS DEBUT ALBUM."
5,Fallin for this CD,"I recently got this CD and this girl is SO talented!! From the piano to the vocals, she is definitely on point. When I first heard Fallin, I was looking forward to the release of her CD. And I was not dissapointed. Unlike her other peers in the music scene (i.e. Britney Spears, Mandy Moore), Alicia has actual talent and has something to say. The situations that are depicted in each song are things that almost every female will end up going through if she hasn't already. She is a little younger than I am and I admire her for her talent. If you don't have this CD, GET IT NOW. You won't be let down. Notable songs are ""Troubles"", ""Why Do I Feel So Sad"", ""A Woman's Worth"", and ""Butterflies"". This CD is beautiful and she has talent beyond her years."
3,"The ""A"" is for average","Alicia Key's is a super talented singer and songwriter but SONGS IN A MINOR isn't all that great. When I heard ""fallin"" I was blown away. It's such a powerful love song. When I listened to the entire album, I realized how average the rest of the songs were. Most of the beats on SONGS IN A MINOR are flat. Even Alicia's lyrics and piano playing can't save it. The album as a whole doesn't flow. The first 3 songs will grab your attentention and hold it but the rest are forgettable. Alicia does a great job of covering Prince's classic ""how come you don't call me"" and ""never felt this way"" is an excellent acoustic ballad/inderlude. She really shows some emotion on those songs... espically on ""fallin"". It seem like Alicia's talent got squashed on most of SONGS IN A MINOR with it's bland production."
2,"Yep, it IS hype. What a disappointment.","Guess I should have heeded the warnings of the other ""real people"" reviews I read that said this was yet another flash-in-the-pan, one hit wonder. Frankly, outside two songs (Fallin' being one, however trite the lyrics), this is ALL B-side drivel. At my first listening, I started out hopeful, but it went downhill from there. Not worth the money. Only reason I gave it two stars is that the woman COULD sing if she had a mature producer to guide her to the right material. Too bad. Damn, I hate being disappointed this way!"
2,Disappointed,"I must say that I am highly disappointed in what the producers decided to do with this talented artist. I was highly anticipating the release of this album since Men in Black Soundtrack. Then the single ""Fallen"" dropped and I knew this project was going to just blow up. Well, it blew up. I am shocked that the producers of this album masked the talent of this young aspiring artist. Her piano and vocal skills are never really given the light of day on this effort. Instead it's watered down with bad drum tracks and hip hop styles to attempt to give it appeal to a larger audience. Believe me, I'm not saying that Alicia Keys does not have talent. I'm saying that the producers opted not to showcase her true talent in attempts to sell a record. I truly hope that this does not turn out to be the first and last CD for Alicia and that her talent is not overlooked the next time out."
3,not quite there....,"...an honest effort from a young woman with potential, but...the production effort is just lazy! maybe that was the intent, but it hurts more than it succeeds. probably just a 2-star rating, but i like the fact that she is trying to do something unique and that alone makes her rare. my piano-playing daughter loves this immensely, so what do i know?"
2,The Music Is Pretty...But...,"I tried to like this CD! I really did. I gave it a fair chance. But I'm afraid that I do not like it that much. I Love the idea of using the piano and adding a bit of soul/R&B to it. However, LYRICS count for something too!!!! All the songs are talking about the same thing, and they are poorly written. I'm sorry, but in my opinion the fact that she wrote every song on the album does not say all that much for her. I really really like the piano playing though. She is very gifted at that. But she really needs to learn how to write good LYRICS! I guess Jill Scott has spoiled me with having wonderful lyrics. Now, I expect more than the typical, same-ol-same-ol that Alicia Keys delivers. Sorry, but I had to be honest!!"
5,alicia keyes do you thing girl,The first thing i hear alicia keys singing it was so touching to my heart to hear hear singing have to go to get her album i hope looking for another album soon
1,"C'mon now, get real!","I'm sorry, but I can't let this one slide. Firstly, I'll admit I haven't listened to this CD in its entirety; I didn't need to see the hustle going down. Anyone with any real knowledge of Soul/R&B music would notice that 'Fallin' blatantly bites off James Brown's 'This is a Man's World'. This music is juvenile and naive at best. Yes, Ms. Keys is physically attractive, has an 'adequate' voice, and can play a little piano. Wow! But no way does her record warrant the hype and accolades its received. If anybody deserves any real credit, its the marketing genius of Clive Davis. He did it for artists like Whitney & Santana, now he's doing it for Alicia Keys. Imagine if he did for an artist who's music has some real meaning, imagination, originality, and depth?(No offense, Carlos.) I say and I'll say it again: Folks, don't get hoodwinked by the hype and PR! Listen closely and the truth will reveal itself."
2,I find myself skipping over too many tracks.....,"Alicia Keys is a wonderful talented singer and piano player, but that's where I have to draw the line. I have over 11 hundred CDs and she just sounds too much like artist I alreday have. A little of Mary J., a little of Faith Evans, a small taste of Amel Larriuex, and a big batch of everything else. I read in article of hers that she was inspired by a lot of singers and song writers. My question to her is, did she get inspired or just plain flat out copied. ""Mr. Man"" (featuring Jimmy Cozier) is my favorite jam on this CD along with ""Rock Wit U"". PLEASE don't think I'm hating this CD, I listen to it often....... I have to, I paid 16 bucks for it. I think she could've let someone else do some of the writting and production"
3,The Girl has talent but ...,"Alicia is a stunningly beautiful girl and she can sing but would she even have gotten a play in the music industry if she looked like Missy Eliot. Don't get me wrong, beauty is subjective and Missy is beautiful to me but the industry looks to a different standard than real folk. I hope that Alicia continues to develop her writing skills and works on her vocals to deepen them. Life is a good teacher though and she will learn. Fallin' is a cool song because it is different that what radio usually plays and should open some doors for some other artists. There is a lot to say about the new crop of artists out today my picks, Alicia Keys, Diana Krall (for some chilled out jazz vocals), Rodney Jones - Soul Manifesto, the funkiest cd of the year and anything Luther!"
2,Off Key,"I purchased this album, sucked in by the hype. Now call me a sucka. Clearly the most overblown R&B album of the year. ""Fallin'"" is fine, or at least it was the 15th time I heard it; as of the 347th time, I've about heard it enough - though it will probably be nominated by the tired Grammy people. And the video is nonsensical. The Jermaine Dupri song ""Girlfriend"" is the only highlight. Hopefully her 2nd album will be of more substance. Dont waste your hard earned money on this one - buy India.Arie instead - a much better production."
4,Something special... but you knew that already,"Alicia Keys is talented - both as a vocalist and as a pianist. It's exciting to hear someone so young put her skills to good use on solid, largely self-created material (take THAT, Mariah!). There are many stand-out tracks, not a bad one in the bunch. Pop/hip-hop ""Girlfriend"" is a personal favorite."
1,HOW AWFULLLLLLLL,ALICA KEYS IS AN EXTREMELY GOOD PIANA PLAYER BUT SHE SHOULD LEAVE THE SINGING TO SOMEONE ELSE. I THINK SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO SING BUT FOR SOME REASON IS NOT. I GUESS SHE IS TRYING TO FIT IN WITH TODAY'S ARTIST. IT IS A SHAME TO SEE THIS TALENT GO TO WASTE
1,Overrated,India Arie was robbed. Sure Alicia keys can play a piano and sure she pretty but she didn't deserve 5 grammies that is just Ludacris.
2,SONGS ARE MINOR ON DEBUT ALBUM,"Alicia Keys is a beautiful lady with a lot of talent, unfortunately her debut ""Songs in A Minor"" does not hold up to that.Amazingly this CD went all the way to No.1 on Billboard Hot 100 Album chart, a feat that doesn't happen much for a debut artist.But my question is why?, when you have India.Arie and Jill Scott.Minor in the title of this effort is a perfect description of how this CD falls. The production is middle of the road, the songs just lack flavor or splash, and Alicias vocals seem down played....and she needs percussion in her songs, oh does she need PERCUSSION!....where is it?I am sorry to say with all the hype this CD is just another been there and done that scenario with no special touch.Now excuse me while I put my Jill Scott CD on and get dressed to go to the used CD/Record store to trade my Alicia Keys in for something else."
3,So So,"Alicia Keys is seriously talented but when will she release a soul album I mean Fallin' is great as is A Women's Worth but whats's with all the hip hop beats? and she keeps ad libbing and going ah yea come on yo what e.c.t like she is about to spit.Please just stick to the soul the other stuff does not suit her if she did an album full of tracks like Fallin she would release a classic, as it stands this is very hit and miss."
4,Butterflyz,"I haven't listened to this CD much. Only a few songs like fallin',how come you don't call me and a womans worth but my absolute FAVORITE song on this CD is Butterflyz! Its such a beautiful love song. Her voice sounds great, its great! Its the kind of song you sing along to hope someday to feel that way about someone. A lot of the songs on the CD are like that."
5,WOW!...,"One day, I was at work. The radio was on. I heard the song ""Fallin'"" for the first time. After only one minute of listening, I knew I had to get the CD immediately after I got off work. I put ""Songs In A Minor"" in my CD player when I got home, and I found it to be the best R&B; album I've ever listened to! Later, I read a magazine article about her and learned that most of her album tracks were recorded when she was a teenager. I was shocked! Someone who sings with that much heart and soul is typically a lot older (think Aretha Franklin). I immediately became a bigger fan after that article. By this time, I'd listened to the CD too many times to count, but she was playing more often afterward.This album proves that Alicia Keys will indeed be around for many more years. I can't wait to hear how her next album will sound."
1,proof that music is dead,"I was really hoping Alicia would be the next great talent to save the name of good music. Wrong. I was starting to like ""Fallin'"" then I couldn't help but wonder.....is the piano part ""borrowed"" from James Brown's ""It's A Man's Man's Man's World"" ??? It was also pointed out that the chorus to ""Woman's Worth"" is a lifted vocal phrase of Ray Charles. So the music trend of stealing others music continues.The Prince cover is nothing to get giddy about and the rest of the album showcases the more superior talents of her background singers over her own singing talent. In short there was much hype over nothing. I figured with all the hype I was putting in the next Stevie Wonder."
1,A minor in songs.,"Alicia still has a lot of growing up to do. This album doesn't strike me as a soul album. It's sort of soul, sort of pop. Alicia doesn't know whether to showcase her classical piano playing, her teenage angst, her pop voice or her soul positioning. It's too confused to have some real soul. I didn't see the fuss about ""Fallin'"" What was that all about?I think India Arie should have won the Grammys."
3,Not Very Impressed,"Don't get me wrong, the girl is talented but I actually like her ability to play the piano more than her singing. I'm at home right now watching the Grammy's and this girl is cleaning up, but I am so not impressed with this album. I bought it a while back, but I've only listened to it twice. It stays on the shelf in the case. My favorite song on this recording is ""A Woman's Worth"". The song that became so famous, ""Fallin"" is just not doing it for me. The down-trodden, low self-esteem message behind the song turns me off. She gets my congratulations for racking up on the awards, but the CD will remain in the case on my shelf catching dust. Although she's not getting the awards that she deserves, I like India Arie much better."
3,"It was GREAT, but not FANTASTIC...","There were some songs that I liked in it and listaned to over and over, but others I listen to once and then just never listen again.This is a nice and fun up beat jazzy CD. Good for Dancing. Fallin, Woman's Worth, Jane Doe, lovin U, and How Come You Don't Call Me have catchy tunes and are the ones to pay attention to. On a couple of the songs there was some spikes in the backround; not to disturbing but a little distracting."
2,Ummm,"Alicia Keys is talented, a decent songwriter and has a smooth soulful voice. Fallin' was a good track with her smooth lyrics!The problem is that she is FAR too OVERRATED...She will always only have been the 'minor' one hit wonder in the UK."
2,so what!,I will add my disappointment to the hundreds of others. This album is Ok but it is a very sad reflection on the music industry when something so banal is made to seem original and special. The awards for this album at the Grammies convinced me that they must be fixed.
4,Heartwrenching and inspired,"This CD has to be one of the best I've heard in a long time. Alicia Keys has proved that a young musician with good looks can actually make classic and respectable music efforts. The CD contains the definite talent showcases ""Girlfriend"" ""Fallin'"" ""A Woman's Worth"" and, my favorite song on the album, ""Troubles."" Unfortunately, I only give the CD 4 stars because while the second half of the CD is pleasant enough, it just isn't full of the inspiration the other tracks are, and they are also much more forgettable."
3,Good - but over rated,"I agree with many of the above reviewers that this cd is good - but way too much hype attached to this project. Part of me wonders if it is because she is so young. If this same cd was released by a 30 year old, would everybody be falling over themselves? Probably not. I borrowed this from a friend and glad I didn't buy it.For somebody worth more hype - try India Arie"
2,Keys should stick to the ivories,"This album was a disappointment. Alicia Keys has weak vocals and mediocre musical style. Although she may have so-so talent with piano chords, she's not overly impressive with her vocal chords. Don't get me wrong, I really tried to give it a chance because some CDs require a few 'listens' before they grab you, but the only song that really moved me was Fallin', and I LOVED that one. The rest of the tracks just don't do it for me. I think she'd make a cute background singer, but there's not enough depth to be a lead act. If you want to be impressed by female musicians who are also actual singers as well as thought provocing song-writers, try Me'Shell N'degeocello or India.Arie."
5,"Amazing, Talented, and Lovely","Alicia Keys is like the second coming of Etta James, Anita Baker, or Billie Holiday. The album is as beautiful as the artist. Lately, we have witnessed a Renaissance in R&B. The Real singers are coming back. Jill, India, Erykah, Mary, and Now Alicia. Sisters who sing from the soul, who let you feel them when they hit the mic. Alicia is truly talented. She doesnt need to shake her moneymaker to sell this album.This is music from the soul, not the flesh. I miss music from the soul. Music that makes you weep, makes you want to make love three or four times a day. I miss sincereity. I'm tired of the Fake Stuff and you should be too. May the Ancestors bless Alicia Keys."
2,another phony r&b queen,"this girl's voice is thin as paper, but like clive davis recent discoveries he is always going for that colorblind b.s. she does not have the voice of an angel maybe one she will grow into her talent but now she reminds me of mariah carey biracial, looks like an everywoman ( familiar) no talent."
2,I must be missing something...,"I just don't see what the big deal is with Miss Keys. She's not breaking new ground or doing anything interesting (in my book)> To me it's all hype, no substance, no juice."
1,"A great singer, but....","So far, Alicia Keys is all about hype. She has a great voice, and can become a great female vocalists. But.............She needs to get someone else to write material for her. Her CD has, in my opinion, only two good songs: Fallin' and How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore (A Woman's Worth, the other song you hear her sing in appearances, is really pretty awful).Notice how few songs she ever sings. That's because she only has two, maybe three worth singing. Five Grammys? Shows how bad the voting is. I guess if she shows up next year still sining Fallin' they'll give her two more. A third should go to her PR operation.I really like her singing. She has great potential. But in this CD, she is just too full of herself. Annoying chit chat between tracks.She can sing a five star production. But this is not it. I tried to learn to like the CD, but in the end just burned two of the selections onto another CD and happy to ditch the rest."
3,ehhhhh...,"for someone who is supposed to be a bright new musical genius, she sure uses a lot of samples and includes a lot of remakes. Remakes, I might add, that are best left alone. Even if she does have some legendary folks playing on her album, those all-too-familiar beats and songs really detract from the album's originality. I mean, some songs are cool (Troubles, Mr. Man), but this sounds like just another r&b album. If you want to compare anyone to Prince in terms of musical ability and creative songwriting, I'd pick Fiona Apple in a heartbeat before I picked Alicia."
1,A True Disappointment,"I was one of the many people that rushed out and purchased this cd after hearing Fallin on the radio. Once i got home i heard the remainder of the cd and was really disappointed. There isn't really that much true piano playing on the cd and the songs just aren't good, except for maybe How Come You Dont Call Me Anymore, which is purely a Prince song and Never Felt This Way/Butterflies which is just her version of the Brian Mc Knight song. Save yourself the 14 bucks. I am a true neo-classic soul fan and found this album a big waste of time and money."
3,Should have been more,"I thought this cd would have been remastered with originals and add a little twist to the songs. I was highly disappointed with this. Having many unplugged and live songs I thought this would have been on here. After listening to this cd 10 years later which I always loved this cd makes me thing that her music is not in the classic stage yet. Some people music is an instant classic,but not this cd. Maybe she should have waited for the 20 year remastered release. Just my opinion.."
3,Missing in Action,"I agree with the previous reviewer - whoever made the choices on this disk obviously didn't LIVE during WWII or they would have known that ""Apple Blossom Time"" and ""White Cliffs of Dover"" were the REAL classics of WWII!"
1,Obvious Omissions,"I can not believe an album of songs regarding the World War II era not including ""The White Cliffs of Dover"" and ""Apple Blossom Time."" I'm sure there are more, but they are glaring omissions!"
1,Not a history of Chile or of Chilean economics,"I rarely give a book 1 star, but this book merits it.Except for literally the first and last chapters, precious little is said about Chile or the economy of Chile.The entire book is about how the economics department of the University of Chicago allied with Universidad Catolica de Chile to place Chilean foreign exchange students in positions of authority in Pinochet's government.I guess that the title of the book should have been a clue, but I had no idea the entire book would be on this one limited theme, spelled out in nausiating detail, blow-by-blow, year-by-year. And yes, the author is leftist and does seem to strain to see a conspiracy behind every tree.A terrible book. Perhaps good as a Ph.D thesis, but not a book."
2,Upside down,This book focus on a fascinating subject: the story of how a bunch of Chilean free market economists transformed a dictatorship into a model democracy and a prosperous economy. Valdes describes the team and its origin with skill and knowledge. But then his partisan socialist background betrays him and he begins to see conspiracies and imperialist designs. A wasted opportunity.
3,Great stuff but there are alternatives,This is indeed the classic SE Asia book and it keeps getting better. But I agree with the previous reviewer that Indonesia is virtually a different continent adding too much extra weight. However there is a 'mainland SE Asia' book which is very light and easy to carry: Trailblazer's Southeast Asia by Mark Elliott. It's a bit strange at first glance but is packed with maps and when you get used to all the icons (and discover just how easy it is to travel in SE Asia anyway) it may prove all you need. Best of all it's very portable. There are helpful reviews on Amazon.co.uk including mine! Worth thinking about if you want something different.
4,typical shoestring guide,"This guide is really good value, although you notice easily that it covers a lot of countries. South East Asia is big, the book is limited in size and therefore detail is missing. I bought seperate guides for Laos and Cambodia and this benifited my trip greatly.Also, the part about Bangkok doesn't show the best bits and doesn't quite warn you for the worst(sex tourism), either."
1,lonely Planet- south east asia on a shoe string,this book cost almost $40 and yet the product description failed to mention that the book was a 2004 edition. it is now pointless as we are now in the year 2012. all potential information regarding the books contence could have changed during the past 8 years making this purchase useless and a waste of money
1,Banal liberalism from a failed police chief,"Former Chief Bouza led his city in a denial of the serious crime problems that it was facing. He denied that the city had a gang problem until gang violence skyrocketed--eventually to the point where Minneapolis was labeled ""Murderapolis"" on the front page of the Sunday Times. He was succeeeded by two chiefs who turned around the police department and who have succeeded at reducing crime.The difference in leadership is thatBouza advocates holding society accountable for the actions of criminals, and effective police leaders hold criminals accountable for criminal behavior."
5,A good grip,Marineland canopy handle is a great product. Easy to peel paper on the self adhesive surface makes for quick installation. I think more people would buy these if they knew they were avaiable.
2,Not too happy with them,"I am not to happy with these. I liked the clear look much better for my tank vs the brown handles, but I wish I would have went with old faithful. These look very nice, but I have dropped my lids several times due to them. They are simply flush, without a groove or lip. So when your hands are wet and you grab this handle ""whoops"""
4,"Re Akai 120,Daytek DVRP30, Liteon5001 And Kin","I Can Only Speak For The Daytek Version Of This Unit. Good Basic Machine. Slim Lines, Fairly Elegant. Blue Light At Top Can Be Toned Down With A Dark Felt Tip Pen. Have Used Memorex+R,Fuji+R,Verbatim+RW. All Successful And Play In My Two Year Old Toshiba Player.Seldom Use RF For Recording, AV And S VidAppear Somewhat Better. Good Results At EP Mode. On The DVRP30 There Is A Hidden Menu.On Setup Highlight Exit But Do Not Press Enter.On Remote Key In 2960 Then Press Enter.A Menu Comes Up Which Makes The Unit Region Free And Macrovision Free.This Is Worth Another Star At Least."
1,"Great price, but doesn't work....","What more can I say....except do not waste your money. I tried using various media and eight times out of ten it would not format. I tried using the timer, it recorded for 8 minutes and then gave me a 'failed' message, resulting in my missing my favorite show.Either invest in a Pioneer, or keep your VCR until the cheaper models become more reliable."
1,"Not recommend it, returned mine","Not a good, easy to use, reliable and quality product (Yes still has a good price, but for me it doesn't worth it, I pay a little more to get a keeper not something for 2 weeks of Olympics). Look elsewhere since there is a good bunch of new and better DVD-recorders out there."
5,IT WORKS!,"After doing much research on inexpensive DVD recorders I bought this one. I am transferring all my old home movies from VHS tapes to DVD. The Memorex +RW media works great and plays in all players I tried, including the DVD Rom on the computer. The +R media only seems to play in the Akai unit that recorded it. I also wanted to edit raw footage from my Hi8 camcorder using authoring software on my computer. I had tried capturing it with a capture card straight to the computer but had major trouble with audio sync. Now I record it to DVD, rip it on to my hard drive, edit it, and send it back to the unit with the firewire to burn it. A great solution for all my needs for $199!"
2,tempramental,"lets start with the positives.Price, easy to use on screen menu, good quality recordings.pal and ntsc playback is a feature that i use but have not found on any other dvd at this price. The bad news was that it stopped working 4 weeks after i bought it. the disc would keep spinning while the machine kept displaying ""load disc"". sent it in for repair. I paid for the shipping. (only has a 90 day warranty, not 1 year). works fine now (most of the time) but also will not finalize some discs after spending 2 hours recording which is very fustrating because if you cannot finalise you cannot play the disc on any dvd player."
3,Uncertain,"I am still uncertain about this Recorder. The unit is the least expensive I found and it looks good. Does it work? ... well, sometimes ...I couldn't use any of the 5 Memorex DVD+R I bought initially.Based on recommendation here, I then bought a 50 pack Fuji DVD+R disks. I transfered 5, 6 VHS tapes to them, the unit worked wonderfully. Then it stopped working. This past week, I tried about 10 blank disks, the unit either could not read it, could not format it, or had a write failure after a few minutes.I am going to try different brands of media next week. I do hate to throw good money after bad though ...."
2,Not the best choice,I had this DVD recorder for two weeks. Initially it worked fine but later it started having trouble playing any DVD. The DVDs would get stuck frequently while playing (the DVD play fine in the Sony DVD player). So maybe a problem with this unit but I just returned it. Will buy a Sony DVD recorder once they are little cheaper.
3,Good Picture.,"I have had mine for a little less then a year. The recorded picture quality is very good both on EP and SP. Like the previous reviewer, I also am having problems with the drive not opening and closing. When I do manage to get it open, it will not read the DVD unless I open and shut it a few times. This must be a defect in this model. Buyer beware."
2,"""La Vie en Rose"" is in English!!!","Besides the fact that ""La Vie en Rose"" is sung in English it's a good CD."
3,Preference for french,"If you are looking for the La Vie En Rose in french you will be very disappointed in this CD, as I was. Otherwise the sound is exceptional, except one song, and the music is really beautiful, and definitely worth the price."
2,Received wrong size,"I received the wrong size. Contacted seller who said he would check the warehouse. Have not heard back from him. Product is great, but I would have liked to have received the size I ordered."
4,Great source of antique country furniture ideas,This book has an excellent assortment of photographs of antique country furniture. The pictures are very colorful and clear. They are great resource for those interested in recreating antiques. The projects were not that detail oriented. I would recommend this book for the ideas it presents through pictures.
5,Great book for how little I paid for it.,"The book was shipped and arrived quickly. The book was super cheap so I did not have high expectations, but it came in much better shape than I expected it to. I would definitely recommend to other students. I will use them again"
4,"Slow start, great middle, good finish.","I've been doing some research into film making and I picked this book up from the bookstore because it looked okay. At first I was a bit let down, but after getting into it I found it truly great! The author gives an amazing amount of examples, and even though they're a little outdated, he gives them in such ways that you don't have to have seen the movies to learn from his examples."
5,Highly Recommended! Very Helpful! Thanks!,"I'm so glad to find this well written, practical book that go beyond the 101 stuff.If you've been meditating and know about energy this book's a wonderful addition to your magickal library. It has clean, clear high energy. Thanks D. Cunningham, Ellwood and Wagener! I LOVE it! Blessings :)"
4,can anyone out there help me out?,is there any way to get in touch with any of the authors?I tried to email them but they fell off the face of the earth. I tried to email egregore publishing. im not buying lottery tickets anytime soon.thanksbobjr508@yahoo.comthanks
3,"Good and direct, but incomplete","The title of this review says all. The book is very informative, gives an introduction to entity creation, but I realized that there's some things that are missed. A good example of this ""lack"" of information is HOW I KNOW THAT I CREATE AN ENTITY?I think I created an entity because I did everything that the book asked to, but I'm not sure...What should I do now? Wait bindly for the expected results? But if the entity was not created? Should I wait for expected the results and die waiting for them?"
3,"Good information, lousy production values","Lots of good practical information, nicely sequenced, with a few innovative ideas, once you get past the introductory mishmash. About a third of the book is appendices.Many of the pages, though, were faint like a 7th generation photocopy. That and a couple of wrong words used (""some"" when they meant ""sum,"" ""council"" for ""counsel"") mar an otherwise pretty good effort."
1,New age at its best,"Depending on your magickal preferences you might actually like this book, but be warned that all of it is based on a new age approach. In other words, you won't be actually summoning any entities or creating them per se', but rather imagining, visualizing and then using your selective perception to attribute ""outcomes"" to your mental construct. Of course, if the events will tend to unfold in a non-desirable manner, you can always blame it on entity doing a ""bad job"" and mentally dismantle and dismiss it. All in all, the whole system presented reminds child's play with an imaginary friend: if that's your cup of coffee, go for it -- you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, stay wary of the promises presented."
4,Good for beginners,"This book is great for people starting to learn how to create spirits, tuplas, and the like. Of course, it is not geared for the person who just started to learn magick.Creating Magickal Entities walks you through the steps it takes to create your own entity. It goes on to explain how to work with your spirit to get things that you want. There is an interesting section on ethics that is refreshing to see in a book like this (it's not the typical three-fold law warning).The book is written in a simple, down-to-earth way that kind of makes you feel that Mr. Cunningham is talking to you. This book is also written in such a way that just about anyone from any tradition could use some or all of the methods described in Creating Magickal Entities.This is definitely a book to add to any magickal collection and to use as a lesson book."
3,A primer in the basics,"This small text, while by no means great, accomplishes the desired end, and does have some excellent parts. Being a survey of the art of entity creation, the book manages to cover all of the essentials and basics that are tried and true, and has an excellent chapter on creating the varied appearance of the entity on the basis of its intended purpose (which has excellent direct relation to talismanic magic - a created entity being a talisman, essentially). I thoroughly enjoyed this chapter, as it presented info I had not come into contact with before, and, though only 3 pages (the chapter, that is, not the book), I'd think it useful to any practicing student of esoterics.I feel the book went a bit wrong in its appendices, one author's ""real life"" example in particular. While entities (and talismans) can be used to exact revenge, it's best not to highlight those."
4,The good and the bad!,"The faucet is beautiful but it came damaged. It did not work (leaked at the bottom) and I had to order another one. Once you do get one that works though, you'll be in heaven, they are wonderful."
5,Very nice faucet at a reasonable price,Bought and installed this faucet with the Inello tempered glass vessel sink. We're extremely satisfied with the quality and the price of both items. The fauced creates a nice waterfall effect and seems solid and built to last. Recommend.
1,It's a Leaker,This thing leaked internally from day one. I fixed the leak myself with great effort to avoid the hassle of shipping it back. This was to no avail anyway because the chrome/paint? pealed off the top by the knob. We finally tossed it.
2,Good photographs,"Nice book to see with colourful, big and original pictures, but not enough or accurate information for an aviation reader"
1,Just plain wrong . . .,"Nice pictures, but totally inaccurate. On p.122 Mr. Rabinowitz shows a great, full-page picture of the Navy's Blue Angels flying in close formation. They are, as any aviation buff knows, flying F/A-18 aircraft. Problem is, the chapter is devoted to the F-15. Maybe it's a generic picture paying tribute to all high-performance fighters? I looked, but found no such reference. What I did find was the caption of the picture extolling the virtues of the F-15 and, as evidence, pointed to the ""fact"" that the Blue Angels fly them. HAH! An aviation book that does not know the difference between the F-15 and F-18 is not worth the paper its printed on."
1,"Nice pics, but he's got his facts wrong..","Nice big shiny pictures, and if that's all you want, fine. If you want *accuracy* however, look elsewhere. On p.122 Mr. Rabinowitz shows a great, full-page picture of the Navy's Blue Angels flying in close formation. They are, as any aviation buff knows, flying F/A-18 aircraft. Problem is, the chapter is devoted to the F-15. Maybe it's a generic picture paying tribute to all high-performance fighters? I looked, but found no such reference.

An aviation book that does not know the difference between the F-15 and F-18 is not worth the paper its printed on. Can't wait to read Mr. Rabinowitz's book on the ""Chevrolet"" Edsel. ;)"
4,worth its money,"A well functioning little machine, maybe for some people some what slow, but I can work it.For the money it is quite good. Every thing is functioning and working okay.Thanks for upgrading it for me.Barbara"
3,Apple Laptop Review,The overall condition was not what I expected for a refurbished laptop; it had several deep scratches on the outside and there were some loose keys and one function key that completely fell off. The overall functionality of the laptop is good as all programs run correctly and it does connect with Wi-Fi.
4,IBook,"This is a great deal for a fully function Mac. I am impressed with the condition of the computer and have had no problems. Like any other Mac I have to get the Microsoft Office so I can do Word, but that is expected. It runs a little slow sometimes, but seems to be working great!"
4,Unique laptop!,"This Ibook is not the most powerful machine but it operates so well. Not good for video game or watch internet tv but for surfing the internet or using itune, watch video stuff will be great. Also when you use apple laptop you never gets virus (that's my opinion but most people who use apple would agree with me)which great to have peace of mind. Solid machine and I love it!"
1,Very DISAPPOINTED,"I can not say im unhappy eith the product, because my children can not use it. I bought two of these ibooks for my kids for christmas. they came with someone else's information on them instead of having the factory specs on it. they both have a password on them that I can not get unlocked. My children were very excited when they seen them, but very disappointed after seeing they could not use them because of the password."
2,Password protected!!!!!!!??????!!!!!!!,"There is no password required to start the computer but the computer needs eight updates and I cannot perform this function. The previous owner's password has not been removed so I can update and load required updates. The previous owner's password is required, however, it was not provided. I have tried to contact Discount Mac Depot with no prevail with their number which was provided on the slip of paper within the laptop. I am most likely going to send this computer back if I cannot obtain the password to change the profile and make the required updates. I will most likely never buy another refurbished Apple again. Overall, I am not happy."
1,False information,"So i purchased this an ibook from this seller and was excited, because it was suppose to be a gift for my fiance. However, when the item did arrived, my fiance took a good look at it and tried to go on the web. The sad thing is it took forever juswt for the web page to load. AFter that, he tried youtube and youtube cannot even load. He tried transferring all his items from his old laptop to this one (the ibook), however it would not read. So he did some research and turns out that this ibook ran at a 133 MHz. He tried downloading the latest version but found out that the ibook could not handle it because it ran way too slow. I remembered that the description said 800MHz too. So we returned the item due to failure and false advertisement. sad..."
3,Misunderstood,"I love Mac and have my own Macbook so when it came to buying a laptop for my 10 year old daughter, I went to used Macs. The G4 seemed like a good buy. What I did not understand was that the computer was not going to play Adobe Flash Player, anything above 10 really. This does not enable the playing of videos. This may be good for some parents but for my daughter, it was not what we were looking for unfortunately. I will be returning the computer regretfully, but mainly due to the fact that I do not understand all the computer logistics, etc, so I thought I would make this review for others. It is a great computer otherwise though which is why I still gave it a 3 star."
1,Ugh,"Save yourself the headaches and buy a MacBook. I purchased my iBook G4 from betaMacs and the experience was horrible. At first I was super excited to have a Mac again, because Macs are known for their stability, reliability, and resistance to viruses. However, by the second day, yesterday, the hard drive was making noises after repeated hangs or freezes. I will be returning this and purchasing a pC until such time as I can afford a new Mac. Terrible experience!"
2,OH GOG,so i got this cpu cuz i was tired of constanly useing my moms. and i connnected to the internet and stuff so i went on youtube and it shut down the browser so i went and updated the mac OS X stuff and it restarted as said but it kept turning on and off . my advice: dont buy computers online. Im going to get it fixed for around 100 bucks. =.= jeez Im stareing at it right now thinking about how stoopid i was and how i should of just listened to my dad and bought one at walmart or somthing.
5,Good machine,"I've got friends with this (I personally have a 15"" PowerBook) machine, and it's great. With OS X I recommend at least 512mb of ram, but for the casual user, 256 would work.And a side note...multiple users posted reviews about how old and outdated an 800mhz processor is; one thing these people don't know is that it's not x86. Anything non-x86 (POWER, PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, Alpha, etc) is much better than anything x86. One number I've heard is that in the days of 100mhz, anything non-x86 was 2 to 2.5 times the speed (100mhz Alpha = 200, 250mhz x86)."
2,It's nice but,"I got a 12 in used today and already want to sell it. The 1 gb memory is so small, that you can't even do the updates the computer needed if you have downloaded anything. The computer is nice, it's a great size, and graphic are good. But this is a HUGE problem for me. I did not realize how fast 1 gb goes, until I got this computer.I will probably get a Mac again I will just need something with WAY more memory."
2,Defective keyboard,"Not Good !! The Laptop looked very nice from the outside but some of the keys didn't work. I purchased it on May 20, 2009 and still have not received a replacement or refund. Still waiting......"
3,Happy I guess,"I guess I am happy with this computer, I am not happy about the lenght of time it took to get to me."
2,Disappointed,"Computer is as described cosmetically, however it is missing the X key and I have no idea how to find a replacement. I bought this computer for my daughter and she is unable to use it until I can A) Purchase a new charger and B) Find a replacement X key. Also wasn't aware from product description that we would not be able to access the internet without a airport card which was not included."
2,battery does not take a charge,I expected this laptop to have scratches or some cosmetic issues. However that is not the case. The battery will not take/hold a charge. Being the fact it was a Christmas gift to a child I would have told the buyer.
2,"Slow and a small screen, what is there to like?","Well it's worth 2 stars because it's fine for reading email. Perhaps writing a Word document. And only if you do those things for less than 30 minutes a day (eye strain builds up after a while).It is useless for games, video, music or long term computer use. And since the CPU was slow and outdated 2 years ago, it's pratically useless now for any new software.I would say the price is great, but why spend money on something you really can't use?So unless you have almost no computing needs, buy a fast G5 or Centrino, or don't bother."
3,Overpriced TOY ! ! !,The laptop is OLD and OVERPRICED !!! Get yourself a real laptop (check out latest Compaq models)!!
1,Not good for 98% of people,"Why be the tiny 2% of all PC users and use an OS that's outdated and SLOOOOOW and sold by a company whose CEO thinks he's god? You can think you look cool or ""unique"" but carrying an Apple product just marks you a freak, an elitist. Take this iBook for example. It has a very slow processor, reports of motherboard problems, and a screen that's dark and bluish (esp. right next to Sony's notebooks). Battery life gets pretty bad (<2 hours) after the first few weeks. The entire package feels cheap, even though you are paying a lot. And face it, to make it into a useful computer, you will still end up buying lots of M$ software. So might as well admit it upfront and go with the flow. It's dangerous to think you are smart by being in the 2% while 98% of the world is stupid and wrong."
1,Terrible Internet functionality,"This computer is good for two types of users: 1) hard-core Mac fanatics who were raised on these machines and know them inside-out; and 2) people with special computer needs (e.g., photo editing).For everyone else, stay away. The basic functionality on these computers simply doesn't stack up to comparable (or even slightly cheaper) PC laptops. Most importantly, browsing the Internet on this computer feels like 1997 on a PC. It crashes, freezes, takes forever to load pages, can't interact with video or sound, etc.I used to be a big Mac fan, but they have totally lost the edge. Unless you really know what you're getting into, stick with a PC. (You'll also get a lot more for your money.)"
5,Bat Boy makes Urintown look like yesterday's leftovers,"Talk about fresh, honest, pure, unadulterated joy! While this show is destined to be done again and again, this original cast is one of the finest ensembles assembled in New York in years. Their ultimate tribute will come in the form of future company productions in which actors will be unable to create any interpretation other than that presented by the amazing talents of the original cast. There is not a false move here. Look for each of the leading actors to be ""discovered"" as future stars. Where did they come from? They were all together on a single stage performing a brilliant score together while New Yorkers flocked to Urinetown to glean humor from spoofing famous musicals of the past. Thankfully, Bat Boy takes a risk and takes us into a future full of comfort and joy!"
4,Whatcha Wanna Listen to Tonight?,"Hopefully you picked Bat Boy. After recently listening to a few songs online and reading some reviews I decided I had to buy it. The cd is great, and it is a must have for any musical lover. The opener is great, and there are many catchy songs, great voices, and funny moments in the show. GET THIS CD!"
1,I have to be frank,"This off-broadway (US version) of the Bat Boy Musical as SOME good qualities to it, but it makes me sad when I can't listen to my favorite tracks without cringing to the off-key notes and sounds that somehow let these people basically trek through the songs.If anyone is out there, please PLEASE sell the UK version of the Bat Boy musical, trust me, if you like Bat Boy the musical, you will really love the UK version."
1,Ugh,"AS enjoyable as the screeching, whining, and random apearence of Pan to teach the two leads all about the birds and the bees is.. or is not.. in this case.. if you like campy, silly, and very little talent youll love batboy. if you have a musical ear.. leave this one to those who arent looking for good quality voices, music, and scores."
5,Best musical score in years.,"This is the funniest, most tuneful show I've come across since Little Shop. The perfect blend of comedy and pathos. Soaring melodies you can't get out of your head (particularly ""Hold Me, Bat Boy,"" ""A Home for You,"" and my personal favorite ""Show You a Thing or Two"") Clever lyrics that make you laugh even in the most serious of the show's moments. And overall the performances are spot on. An unqualified delight."
3,Eh...,"Not particularly well-written music. The orchestration's not bad. Some of the voices are okay, some are pretty bad, and some are on a teeter-totter."
5,Genius!,"The wittiest show in NYC, by far. Even if you don't like musicals (especially bloated, self-important Broadway musicals), you may love ""Bat Boy""--it skewers the empty conventions of the genre but at the same time isn't cynical at all. The story is compelling (although you don't experience much of the very funny book on this album) and the songs are sublime. You'll be humming these tunes for a long time. I have no doubt that ""Bat Boy"" will take its place in history alongside ""Little Shop."""
5,This Bat Boy can fly!,"My first exposure to this musical was actually performing it at Portsmouth, NHs' Seacoast Repertory Theater. I was playing (drums) for a production of theirs (42nd Street) and was asked if I'd like to play Bat Boy. Not knowing what to expect, I picked up the CD and was blown away by the music therein. Needless to say, I accepted right away! O'Keefe runs the gamut of musical styles, and the play has never a dull moment. Oh, *ping* ""nevermindplease"" - Deven May was a great Bat Boy, but Billy Butler, who played him at the Rep, was BORN for the role and IMHO is better than May, which IS hard to do...;-) BUY THIS CD!!!!!!! Better yet, see the show and buy the CD!!!!!!"
4,Strangest musical I've ever seen...,"Some friends of mine brought me to a performance of this musical in New Orleans last week. After I saw it, I had to log on to Amazon and order the soundtrack, because this was the strangest, craziest, most bizarre play I've seen in a good long time.""Bat Boy"" follows the ""Little Shop of Horrors"" school of musical comedy, turning the grotesque into the goofy. The songs range from 50s-style pop to rap to a sort of Barry White love theme near the end, with every style being done equally well. If you aren't careful, you'll laugh too hard to realize how good a musical this really is.Some of the lyrics go beyond goofy to actually corny, and when that happens you get pulled out of the show for a moment... but only for a moment. This is a soundtrack that will please any fan of musical theatre that's looking for something new and a little... or a lot... different."
4,"For some reason, I love this musical.","I don't know what it is about it, but I love this album. The music here is really swell! Though it is an ""adult"" musical, I still find I'm able to enjoy the dark comedy and get into the characters.This album features a very talented cast and the great songs found in the musical. I love all the songs, but ""Children, Children"" has always confused me. However, ""Three Bedroom House,"" ""I'll Show You A Thing or Two,"" and the lullaby always bring a smile to my face. Of course, ""Comfort and Joy"" is my favorite as Act One finales always seem to be especially strong (I love stage montages that take you everywhere).I really don't know what else to say, but if you loved this musical, you'll want this CD."
5,I LOVE BATBOY!!!!!!!!!,"I am doing this show right now and when I first heard the songs I fell in love!!! This musical has some rock-ish songs,rap,gospel, and hillbilly songs.It also has your classic Broadway-style songs. I must say, some numbers are goofy, but everything is so darn catchy you can't help but fall in love with it. The best song is ""I Imagine Your Upset"" because it is a mix of the previous songs in the musical and it is so sad!You will love Batboy!!!!!!"
4,Should Have Made It To Broadway!,"Better than most productions opening on Broadway these days, ""Bat Boy"" was a smart musical, with an upbeat score & fun cast. Sure the premise is hokey, but it's fun!Best Tracks:Hold Me, Bat BoyShow You A Thing Or TwoComfort And JoyInside Your HeartHopefully, this show will reappear someday soon!"
3,Solid Show With Good Music,"Bat Boy is the best of the wildly irreverant Off-Broadway shows to come about in the past 5-6 years. It has several laugh-out-loud moments, some fantastic music, and a solid cast.I would hesitate to recommend this to all listeners, though. This musical gets more and more outrageous as its story progresses, until it is pushing disturbing near the end. If you want a cute show, this is definitely not for you.But, if you're a fan of the more edgy stuff like Hedwig or Urinetown, you'll enjoy this show."
2,"Not Much Wisdom in ""The Beginning of Wisdom""","The Beginning of Wisdom: Reading Genesis by Leon Kass is an unnecessarily complex and ponderous text on the very lively biblical book of Genesis. It can greatly benefit from a good editor. Also just published this past summer is the Genius of Genesis by Dennis Shulman. Shulman's book is more compelling and much better written than Kass'. If you are looking for a contemporary perspective on the first book of the Bible, I recommend Shulman's book."
3,well done muzak,"Does the idea of a collection of orchestral covers of Simon and Garfunkel songs appeal to you? (And if so, why?) If this concept sounds good to you, then you will probably enjoy this CD.I picked up this CD very inexpensively, at least partially in order to determine what exactly a synphonic orchestra is. I still do not know, the liner notes of the CD tell you absolutely nothing about the origin of this music or who, if anyone, might be involved in playing it. Does it sound like a real symphony? No. But it is pretty close. I have heard this sound described as polyphonic, which makes it seem like it might be generated by a cell phone, and this is not the case...it is a fully orchestrated, well transcribed, simulated orchestra."
3,Pretty decent '80s album,"""Heartland"" by Real Life is an album that contains ten songs, including their big 1983 hit ""Send Me An Angel."" I still remember the MTV video for this song (back when MTV actually played videos). It was a great video with kind of a spooky atmosphere and a hot chick in it. There was a wolfman also as I recall. This band has a couple of hits (""Catch Me I'm Falling"" is the other hit). You can find the ORIGINAL 1983 version of ""Send Me An Angel"" on this album. There have been re-recordings of this song by Real Life throughout the years, most notably in 1989. In my opinion, the 1989 version of this song isn't as good as the original 1983 version.I give ""Heartland"" three stars. Do I recommend this album? Well, if you want the ORIGINAL 1983 version of ""Send Me An Angel"" then get this album. The other songs are fair to pretty decent, including the title track. Overall, a pretty decent album."
2,Great Ideas........,"I am a huge CW Fan, own everything he has done. SO it is so hard to say this- not his best effort. There are hints of his greatness in this CD but in most cases not realized. In most cases the songs appear to be little more than interesting ideas The exception is ""Joy"" and ""Radar"" Very impressive. For the newbies I suggest ""dirt floor"", ""living wih the law"", and ""Din"""
5,An amazing musician,"Chris Whitley's music was one of a kind. Rocket House is one of the best. Rest in peace, brother."
5,Rocket House: a precious work of genius,"Words cannot explain the musical phenomenon that is Chris Whitley. When purchasing a Chris Whitley album, one can always do so knowing that the are acquiring a song collection that can and most likely will be life changing... This album is most certainly a prime example of what an outstanding and gifted creator Chris Whitley is. There are a variety of styles showcased on this record... When listening to this I cannot help but be taken away into his amazing world... Every aspect of songwriting and production is so fabulous it is truly eye opening. Every song on this record is beautiful, but I must say, Vertical Desert sends shivers up my spine.This album is a treasure... I highly recommend it to the true music lovers our there..."
3,Nice atmospheric,"This is a nice album. The visionary and atmospheric aspects of Chris Whitley still come through his work. He ain't the singer here he was at his start but who wants to hear a second Living With The Law? He still is the awesome guitarplayer and poetic songwriter. Sometimes otherworldly, sometimes strong romantic as in radar, a beautiful song, sometimes creatively extended in combination with dj Logic as in Rocket House, or with a dark edge as in the hidden track. There's always that sparkle in it that elevates him above others."
5,Amazing,"This record is an amazing musically record. It has been in my cd player in my car for weeks, I just listen straight through. With appearences by Dave Matthews which only brought even more texture to ""Radar,"" the rest of the tracks are well mixed and a joy to listen to. I recommend this cd to anyone, its a great break from the pop world which is all you get if you turn on the radio."
3,Unrealized potential,"Professor Kistemaker fails to live up to his potential in this volume. Oh, the reader will get help. However, the reader will not get the help he deserves from Simon Kistemaker.The volume reaches about 30% of Kistemaker's potential. So the volume is a disappointment. As such it is grossly overpriced. It should be a slender paperback, selling for about $9.95.Hopefully, the good professor will take some time to sit down, add some real quality, and produce the substance of which he is capable."
4,A Brief and Interesting Primer,"The title of Stephen Haycox' book is slightly misleading, as the first half of the work details imperial Russia's ""discovery,"" exploration and exploitation of Alaska before selling the massive territory to America in 1867 for $7.2 million (about two cents an acre). The book is a brief and interesting primer on Alaskan history from the middle of the 18th century to the dawn of the 21st. Haycox concentrates on sociocultural conflicts between natives and incomers; interminable discord between environmentalists and industrialists; and since statehood in 1959, strife between competing native, state, and federal sovereignty claims over land and resources. Particularly in the first half of the book, Haycox occasionally obsesses with minutia better left to a lengthier examination. Nonetheless, this is a good and well-written introduction to Alaskan history, including an ample bibliography for readers interested in learning more about America's ""Last Frontier."""
3,Not very well written,"The book contains more of a history of the Russian occupation as opposed to Alaska's history as a territory and State. In that sense, the title is misleading. also, it is not very ""readable"" either. The writing style does not grab me and I have a hard time making it through the chapters."
5,Engrossing,"You hear of so many movies referred to as cult classics, or lost gems, only to find the movies merely mediocre or underserving of their cult status. Trapped, also known as Baker County USA, is a great movie, plain and simple. What makes it so great? Well, while there's all the elements one might anticipe from a film that falls into the sub-genre of Hicksploitation (backwoods justice, nekkid white trash hotties, chases through the woods, beartraps etc) and Henry Silva on all time top form as top dog in a small hill town where nobody dares question his authority, its the insight into the hierachy of said town that makes the movie exceptional. That plus those good one fashioned things like story and well developed, believable characters, goshdarnit."
3,outback movie,"ok outback movie. kind of reminded me of movies like the forest, just before dawn and anything else with crazy rednecks. worth a look"
5,Great Read!,The book starts off a little slow but let me tell you after the first pages I couldn't put it down. I finished reading it while I was at work...OOps!
3,okay,"but not the best thing I've ever read by Ms Michaels, I felt it fell a bit flat. A cute read, but not much of a reread (which is crazy for me, since I reread almost everything)."
2,great series but beware about dvd fail lecture,"Dallas is a great serie, but beware in this season (number 6) because some dvd are not well, you can not see some chapters because the dvd can not read them, the image froze and still that way forever. and another thing this season is NOT CC in english only in portuguese.thank you.raul rodriguez abud"
2,Kraptastic,"Show is toats loosing momentum, cliffhanger was weak, and for this reason this season has very little to start on. Sue Ellen's confused, Bobby's back in charge, and JR is plotting... Uh durrrrrrr&#128513;"
5,Dallas still rocked in Season 6!,"What could be better than a battle for Ewing Oil between Bobby and JR? What could be more glamorous than Sue Ellen's 2nd Wedding to JR? What could be more entertaining than JR's expected fall from grace and Sue Ellen's drunken revolt? Fist fights, bottle breaking, car crashes, and inferno on Southfork....what could be better than that?"
1,no more spanish subtitles?,I can't understand why? launching five seasons with Spanish subtitles and suddenly release the sixth season with Portuguese subtitles only?? Completely unfair for loyal customers and fans!!!
1,"No english subs? oh, please!","Why, why, why there are not english subs?Only Portugues!My God, I spent my dollars for nothing....."
2,Rehash of the same old stuff...,"save your money, and buy one of the older editions of this book.very little new information was added to this book, and the site descriptions are too vague for my tastes. to boot, the book is filled with typos and typeset problems. the crash stories sound like they are lifted directly from newspaper articles, and I simply was not impressed by the book.again, if this is your tea of cup, save your money, and buy one of the older editions of this book."
1,no detail at all,"I was very excited to get this book - after all, the byline is ""a guidebook to LOCATING historical aircraft crash sites in california."" However, the book contains hundreds of listings that have no more than the date and city of the crash. no maps, directions, or gps coordinates. I found only 2 hand drawn maps - so out of the hundreds or thousands of crash sites listed, only 2 can actually be found.The only good part of the book are the few in-depth analysis of the crashes."
5,Muy práctico,"Siempre he recomendado este diccionario a mis estudiantes en los últimos años. Es de buen tamaño, buen precio y fácil de usar. Han sido muy, pero muy pocas, las veces que no he encontrado la palabra deseada. Eso sí, debe tratarse con cuidado pues se le despega muy fácilmente la portada."
5,"finally, some silver ones - and they use LESS INK!","anyone who gets printable cd's knows you CAN'T get the silver ones except online. i'm very pleased with these. printing only words or a high-resolution picture on the whole surface they look BEAUTIFUL.silver is better reason #1they just look nicer. anything in a picture that's white is instead silver & i think classier looking.silver is better reason #2these DON'T eat up as much ink as the white ones do! the surface of the white printables is a layer of something, while these have a roughed up surface. i've used the white ones many times & how they just love to drink up the ink. i replaced my ink before going on this burning binge & i'd guess that these use HALF as much ink. with the cost of inkjet cartridges, this was a wonderful little bonus.i burned several of these & not one coaster. the cd's themselves play/burn nicely. but of course you're not getting them for that. it's so they'll be shiny & pretty. trust me, they are. :)"
4,Very cute,"This is a really cute book. Kind of simple, even for a picture book, but a cute one none the less."
5,New story with the character of a timeless classic...,Was introduced to this book by another mom from my daughter's preschool class. The classic illustrations and uniquely written chatter brought back memories of the children's stories I remember growing up. Hope Wyatt Walker Turbo Talker turns into a series of stories! So hard to find great books like these anymore...I would highly recommend it for any preschool or elementary library.
2,Cumbersome and strangely designed,"This is one of the most bizarre appliances I've ever used! I thought from looking at photos that it would be a hinged device that would open so one could pour in crepe mix and then close to cook them. Instead, I learn that it's huge, but doesn't open at all (making me wonder why on earth it's so big!) but rather cooks crepes on top after being dipped into the batter (a feat I've not come close to perfecting by any means--my batter won't stick!). It's heavy and gets horribly messy. Not recommended at all--it seems it would be easier to go back to making crepes on the stove."
3,excellent quality but overpriced,It's a shame that I can't find couscous at a regular grocery store...I love couscous so I had to get some...As soon as you open the jar the delicate aroma of this fine product fills your nostrils...at a very hefty price!
2,yogurt lids melt,The yogurt lids are not dishwasher safe. They melt out of shape in the silverware area and are too small for the top rack.
1,Don't waste your money on specialized jars,"You can use ANY glass jar that fits into the euro cuisine yogurt maker.If you want to buy a jar, usePyrex Storage 7-Cup Round Dish with Dark Blue Plastic Cover, ClearorPyrex No Leak Lids 7 Cup Round Baking Dish with Plastic Lid. At least you can use those for other things, plus the lids are better, AND they are easier to clean than the little cups.If you don't want to spend any money, then just use some small drink glasses, or old honey jars, or spaghetti jars.Remember, this thing only gets up to 110 degrees max.. any glass container that can stand up to a dishwasher or even a hot summer day will do."
3,Lids,"I have them and I would purchase them again, since I own the Euro Cuisine Yogurt Maker, but I wish the lids had a tighter seal. The lids leak when the yougurt is upended."
3,"Small jars are great, but lids leak","these little jars are about the size of large baby food jars. they are solidly made, and actually rather pretty.They are easy to clean. the lids will leak if you turn them over or tip them. I am new at making my own yogurt. I have found that home made yogurt is much more satisfying for me than store bought - meaning that I eat less. One of these small jars satisfies my appetite. I used to always eat much more of Dannon (my favorite). The yogurt looks more attractive in glass jars that in plastic jars."
2,Lids Leak - Too Small to add Anything Else,"These are certainly handy, but the lids leak. They are tight enough to keep the yogurt fresh, but don't expect to toss one in a bag for lunch.Also, these jars are fairly small. About the size of a store bought yogurt. The problem is there isn't room to add a flavor after the yogurt is made. So no adding fruit!Other wise these do cleanup easily."
2,Size specifications are inaccurate,"I was excited to get glass jars with screw tops for my Donvier yogurt maker. I know these jars were not specifically designed for the Donvier, but the specifications suggested they would fit. The jars were described as having a 2 inch diameter. Even if the interior (vs. exterior) diameter was 2 inches, the jars would easily have fit in my maker. However, the jars are significantly wider (about 2.5 inch interior diameter) making them too large for my yogurt maker. Bummer!"
3,Don't boil,I made the mistake of trying to steralize the lids by putting them in boiling water. Good for the jars but not the lids! I now have six jars without lids! Too clean? Wash in hot soapy water and save steralization techniques for the jars!
3,necessary but too expensive,"My Eurocuisine yogurt maker holds 7 jars, so since I eat a jar daily and since I ferment my yogurt for 24 hours, I needed to buy extra jars. Before I run out of my 7-day supply, I can use the extra jars to make another batch. Also, if I need more yogurt to make some seperate recipe (i.e., cheesecake), the jars come in handy so I can make another batch before I finish my 7-day supply. The only problem is that I thought these jars were TOO expensive and it would have been nice to have the option to purchase 4 jars instead of eight. If I really did not need more jars, I would not have paid this price for an extra set of jars. I am glad to have the option to buy more jars, but at the same time, I feel cheated due to the high price."
3,A bit bigger would be better,"I am sure the size is accurately listed in the description. However, since I am not a numbers person, I just assumed a size in my mind. These jars are probably great if you have the yogurt maker, but quite frankly, I eat 4 of these as one serving. I wish the jars were about twice as big. I'm a small person, and only get a few bites out of each jar."
5,True...,"I am surprised after reading the previous reviews...two mentioned Hemingway. I just finished the book and that was my very thought. Although I would temper that by saying it is very Hemingwayesque with overtones of Dostoevsky. By far the most insightful, best written books I read all year. Note...I am a huge Hemingway fan, therefore my bias. As to the lack of punctuation...I barely noticed. I think it only matters if you can't stomach the book's content...not to say that it's terribly graphic. Simply, some folk won't sit well with scenes depicting the dog fights. While this is the title, scenes involving the actual dog fighting actually take up very little of the book. One thing I don't get, and this isn't the author's fault, why is there a white kid on the cover pointing what looks like a toy gun?"
4,"A beautiful debut novel, a masterpiece.","I have read this several times, and I never fail to be moved.To this day the story remains with me. The author has done a beautiful job of building up the reader's sympathy and empathy for the dog fighter, who in the end -- well - we can't have a spoiler here -- can we?It is masterly from the first sentence on.I look forward to reading much more from Mark Bojanowski.K.M.Kaung"
5,Wow,What an amazing writer this Marc Bojanowski.!!!!I cannot wait for his next masterpiece.Thank you for daring to write such a different book in such a GREAT style.
5,Great Resource,"I would like to review this book again after I actually use it to build a home. But that is a couple years in the future, so I thought I'd go ahead and just review it as a reader.This book is my favorite of the three I've read so far. It gives advice on designing and contracting your own home. Even if you don't plan on designing your own home, it's very useful to understand the basics of sound design. It could help you pick out blueprints, or even analyze the design of a house that's already built. The layout and design of your home is such a huge part of what makes it pleasant to live in.The book also gives useful advice on how to general contract your own home. A good read.For further information on a well-designed home, the author recommends the books A Pattern Language and The Timeless Way of Building, both by Christopher Alexander. A Pattern Language is definitely next on my reading list."
4,Insightful,Madison's thoughts of many subjects from democracy to religion are insightful because it shows what the father of our Constitution believed. I would recommend it for anybody who loves Madison.
4,Hells Yea!,I picked this book up at the Margaret Mitchell Museum in Atlanta. Being a southern woman I found the title and the subject matter interesting. Boy am I ever glad I read this little book! It was pretty intriguing to read 2-3 page summaries about historical and current southern women who've made an impact or just made there presence known. I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's a quick and enlightening read.
5,This is the first book I ever read,"What a long journey it has been since I read this in the 3rd grade. This is what sparked my love of reading. I still have it in a protected cover and I plan on keeping it forever. My copy looks just like that picture. Faded, blue and worn. Perfect."
5,Great gift for kids 10+,"I read this book when I was in 6th Grade and I still remember it - it obviously made an impression. I even wrote a book report on it! The style of writing is appealing, and this book definitely cannot bore anyone. Adults and kids will enjoy it."
3,good but small,"Obviously Benchmade is a well manufactured knife but when I received the ""Benchmade Pardue Design Griptillian Combo Edge Knife with BK1 Coated Blade and Black Glass Fill Handle,"" I failed to take into account the size of it. I assumed it would be drastically larger than the ""mini"" but didn't realize it would be that small. I selected ""OK"" for a rating because I think they should have made the mini a ""mini"" and the regular one ""normal"" size. When I say normal, I mean a blade that is 4-inchs(or near that). I ordered the Benchmade H&K one instead and LOVE it!!! SEMPER FI!!!"
3,Not as pictured,The glasses are not at all the color as shown in the picture. Cheaper looking in person. Prob better for the motorcycle ten a constructionsite.
2,Hip safety glasses,"I thought the look was cool,b ut they fit a little too snug on the sides of my head. Little stiff feeling on the nose and around the eyes."
1,"Dull, plodding, not worth the time.","Is there another book as dull as The Burning City? The characters are passionless, flat and not the least bit engaging. The plot is plodding and floundering. When there is a glimmer of an interesting concept or plot twist it is dropped almost immediately. I forced my way halfway through this book and have absolutely no interest in finding out what will happen next, either to the characters or to the city. Dozens of other Niven books have kept me up nights because I couldn't put them down but The Burning City has all the charm of a term paper written by a bored student on a subject he cares nothing about."
2,Zzzzzz - so what,"I made a real effort to get through this book, and after 250 pages I just gave up.It is not the writing. The writing, dialogue, character development are great, but the story leads no where.They hint at Atlantis from time to time. There is something going on with the plants. There is a caste system of sorts, and maybe just maybe some magic. But it never seems to get going.I really looked forward to this book. These are the guys who gave us Lucifer's Hammer, The Mote in God's Eye, Footfall and so many other great books.And maybe that's part of the problem. I wanted another science fiction book with aliens, wierd ecologies, space invaders and calamity."
1,More rehash from Niven,"Niven was my first favorite author, but he always had a tendency to write as though you missed something. I just finished reading Destiny's Road, which was just awful and boring. This book is pretty much exactly the same, but has fading magic in it instead of fading technology. He also knocks off one of his old short stories about were people. It is so sad to see a once great author nose dive like this, but all of his work in the last 10 years has been terrible. Avoid this book"
1,Slogging misuse of an interesting universe,"It could be that the warlock universe doesn't support a novel. The original warlock stories were fun, usually featuring a clever logical twist. Niven and Pournelle really pull off a stinker here. None of the characters are compelling. Nothing much interesting happens. The book doesn't so much end as creak to a close. Looks like Niven's used up his creative mana.If you're like me, and will read anything Niven publishes, wait for the paperback. You won't feel quite so disappointed."
3,Fantasy NOT Sci-fi,"The writing in ""The Burning City"" is quite good and almost up to the standards I expect from a Niven/Pournelle collaboration, but frankly not quite there.If you like Fantasy as opposed to Sci-fi you'll probably like this book, but if you're looking for straight sci-fi pass it by. All this talk of wizards, magic, and ""wild gold"" stretches reality too far for me. I'll finish the last 50 pages because I always finish a book I start, but it really isn't bringing me a lot of pleasure.To give you a context for my review I think Niven and Pournelles best collaboration was ""Lucifer's Hammer"" which I think would also be their most reality based work."
1,Wake up Jerry!,"I read books based on author and I picked this one up because Jerry Pournelle, in large part, wrote it. I loved his Janissaires series, which he never finished (grrr!), but this one I just can't get into. Vacuous and disjointed are the best descriptive words I could come up with.Mr. Pournelle, and I'm sure his pubisher feels the same way, needs to FOCUS more on his book writing and less on such frivolous use of his time prattling on about the mundane on his web site. And finish Janissaires! I could have written the damn thing myself by now..."
2,Much too long & pretty dry stuff,Not recommended. The book is too long and there is not much of a plot. I found the plot elements hard to follow based on the characters' dialogue. It was like the authors knew what they were talking about but could not successfully communicate the concepts to the reader. The ending was not at all satisfactory. There was no build up to anything important!
2,Well below Niven & Pournelle average,"This is not a good book. I was tempted to stop reading it. On the positive side:+ N & P do know how to tell a story.+ There are some interesting elements in this fantasy world, like the social organization of the city and the magic system.On the negative side:- The plot is too disconnected to grab your interest.- The characters are rather shallow.The ending is part ingenious (fighting the elemental), part nonsensical (burning the contract)."
1,The book had a great start,I am both a SF and a Fantasy fan. I love their earlier science fiction works. This book had me very excited for the first 300+ pages. Then it jumps 23 years into the future and I just couldn't get back into it. I treid like a 100 more pages and I put it down and started a different book.
1,Was his car payment due?,"First, I am a long time fan of just about everything Jerry Pournelle has done. I finished this book, but I didn't enjoy it.If Jerry needs money this bad, he should finish the Janissariesseries and not force loyal fans to buy stuff like this."
4,FULL BLOWN TENOR,Yusef recorded many times for many labels from 1957-1970 but this one must have the best sound quality of them all. It's even better than that sideman date he did for Grant Green for Blue Note- GRANTSTAND. This is a Hard Bop session complete with a slow blues and original ballad. Nat Adderley is on trumpet and the rythem section is lead by Barry Harris on piano. Yusef plays only Tenor Sax on this session.
2,fit,The Putco Element chrome window visor does NOT fit a 2012 toyota camry. They are 2-3 inches short. A big waste of time and money.
5,Best Translation of Quran to date,"This translation is the best quran translation to date. The only thing that it needs to work on is a better index and a little more commentary. Other than that, a great work."
3,FUN CD,"This is a fun cd and the songs are good, but don't be fooled like I was into thinking these songs will be the originals that we've all heard on the radio all these years. One of them is,""Haunted House"". The others come very close and this is a very good album despite that flaw the songs come very close."
4,Wonderful muzak-like interpretations,"Remember how you used to make fun of Muzak tunes in elevators and shopping malls? Well Ray Conniff brings every big hit from 1969 and 1970 to you via the musical magic that only he (and Percy Faith) can muster. Perky singers and flashy brass doing the Beatles, Tom Jones, John Lennon, Cher and more. Listening to this, you fill find yourself wondering why your foot is tapping and why you occasionally sing along in vocal characterizations that belong on the Lawrence Welk show. Rarely, the music can be repetitive. Usually it is inspired in a sort of mutton-chop, leisure suit kinda way. It had its crowd in the late 60s and early 70s and has one here as well. Great funky poarty music as well...turn this on and every head will turn! Grab this one because it is Ray's best two albums ever released in my opinion."
5,Another Surprise!,"This was one of those LPs that sort of scared me off when I first saw it, and had a lot to do with some biases of the time. I saw a lot of titles of the pop music of the sixties, which I spent most of in Southeast Asia. But as a loyal Conniff fan of the highest order, I dutifully accomplished the obligatory ""listen."" Another surprise! Ray's treatment of these songs is extraordinary, and made me forget about the terrible initial renditions of some really good songs by some really mediocre singers from the sixties. I am so glad I made the initial purchase, and even happier when this ""two-fer"" came out on CD."
3,In The Arms of Angels,"As I mature, the existance of angels in my life and my awarenes of their impact on my life, has renewed my interest in them. This book relates stories of others who also have been impacted by them also and how it affected their lives. It is interesting to find out how active angels are and the various ways they make their existance known. In The Arms OF Angels does exactly that!"
3,IN THE ARMS OF ANGELS,THIS WAS JUST OK. THE STORIES WERE SELECTED WITH SOME THOUGHT BUT COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BETTERAND INCLUDED SOME FOLLOW UP ALONG WITH SPECULATION AS TO WHY THE INDIVIDUALS WERE SAVED BYANGELS AND HOW IT CHANGED THEIR LIVES.
3,Not as good as I'd expected,"Since I AM a believer of ""angels"" (in human form,too)I thought I would find this book GREAT. Well, I am disappointed. It delivered what it was supposed to deliver, but somehow for me, the stories were OK. I AM glad I have the book though, as I occasionally refer back to a story that may have really enchanted me. Thanks."
3,Not the greatest,Was very excited to receive this book but not what I thought it would be. True there are some inspiring stories but not a great read on the whole for me. I was hoping for something more............not sure what but I did not find it in this book.
4,In The Arms of Angels,"In The Arms of Angels - True Stories of Heavenly Guardians is a comforting affirmation of God's unconditional love for all of us. It is a reassuring reminder that we are being watched over, guided and protected by His heavenly messengers. It left me with a feeling of peace and the resolve to become more aware of and attuned to those around me whose lives I touch and/or who have touched and made a positive difference in mine. I walk away from this book with a sense of gratitude."
4,In the Arms of Angels,It was just what I wanted and expected. I am reading a lot of books about Angels and I just wanted some short stories to read before I went to sleep. The stories are interesting and leave you with a warm feeling.
5,Uplifting Angel Stories,"At a time when more than 75% of all Americans publicly admit a belief in angels, IN THE ARMS OF ANGELS whets our appetite for angel information as it delivers a feast of wonderful stories about amazing and mysterious angel encounters. From tales of very young children saved from death by watchful guardians to stories about helpful men and women who have warned, protected and reassured those in need... these stories will make you want to laugh, cry, and get goose bumps of amazement. IN THE ARMS OF ANGELS is a perfect book to read at bed time every night, to remind us that we are never alone, and that there is always help at hand when we most need it. I give this book my very highest recommendation!-- Cynthia Sue Larson, author of ""Aura Advantage: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success"""
3,it was ok.,"The book was short, but very concise with the stories. Not a whole lot of detail about what the people who saw/had contact with angels saw. And, not a whole lot about what was said by the angels."
5,Excellent book!,"What a spell-binder! From start to end this is an excellent read that has you on the edge of your seat wondering what the hey will happen next. It reminded me a bit of Llosa which means Household really did get into the spirit of South America. It deserves to be among the all-time best horror stories, but like much of Household remains undiscovered by much of today's readership. Buy it!"
3,"Fine book, but not the least bit scary","This book was a major letdown because I thought it was supposed to be a horror story. I stumbled across this book, and this author, by searching for lists of the scariest novels ever written. While the book was interesting, and there were plenty of details which hinted at future mysteries and terror, they never arrived. Even the other reviews here talk about how scary this book is...it's no scarier than an old Hardy Boy mystery.If you read this book, don't read it expecting to enjoy a scary story, and you'll probably be satisfied."
5,My First Time trying Yoga,"Great products. It is a five set piece work out VHS set that covers every type of excercise involving Yogo, from abdominal work out, relieving stress, upper body, lower body, and stretching. All the workouts takes place in a peaceful and beautiful location in Maui, Hawaii. The instructors are great, and the works outs are between 30 to 45 minutes long. This product was a steal! It cost me $1.00 plus shipping and handling, which came to about $5.00 total."
4,For what I wanted,"I wanted a small inexpensive stand as I don't have much room in my studio. I don't need to move it around and I don't do fine woodwork so keep that in mind. It is easy to set up the stand and mount the saw. (I have a DeWalt sliding saw). The support extensions are easy to use. One downside at least with the big sliding saw is that the stand bends as you move the blade. Takes some getting used to the wobble as you cut. This is not the stand for someone who really enjoys finely made tools. It is cheap, small and usable which is what I needed. I just need to cut some 2 X's. If you need it for more precise work I don't think you will be happy with it."
1,Debotchka de Shtinko,"I heard a lot of hoopla about this band that they call the Devotchka, and went to see them with Crooked Fingers in Denver. Man, what a contrast between a creative, genuine band and a uninspiring lot of wieners. All of Devotchka's songs sounded basically the same, with the lead singer howling like a sick coyote over it. Despite the unusual instruments used and outward show you have a few musicians who aren't really doing anything exciting. The tuba gets the one star."
4,Classic Ventures,"If you're reading this, you're probably already a Ventures fan. This album is a good selection of some of their most popular tunes, so you won't be disappointed. You can, however, probably find all these songs on another of their many albums. If you're like me, you might just listen to one of these songs (Hawaii Five-O) and have it stuck in your head for days, so beware! And enjoy!"
4,Fra-gi-lee Funny,"What fun! The father's three phrases: ""It's a clinker..."" ""Fra-gi-lee, it must be Italian"" & ""It's a major award"" work without a hitch. Both pieces are well-constructed & easily stand up. The only thing that would make it better is if the tiny bulb in the lamp actually lit up. But why not get the working 20"" version of the leg lamp as well."
5,My Youth,"Ok, after you have gone back stage at a local arts college when Orleans was an Ithaca band just starting out, and you even went back stage and had beverage with the drummer, you are bringing something to the listening. So this is not an objective music critic opinion. Hearing them live in a small venue back in the sixties with the smell if incense in the air, no one inhaled, and appreciating their virtuosity expressed in hard to resist music, was simply great. And regardless of how many times I hear ""You're still the one"" I still want to sing.... Whoa, TMI?"
2,too harsh,"My favorite (and only) CD that I have, by the Young Dubliners, is ""Red"". I like that one because of the amount of violin which is interwoven into the melodies. When I got this CD, Real World, I was disappointed, because I expected more of the same. Instead, it seemed too harsh, and had less real violin in it, just some very short little sections. If you like rock, you might find this CD ""edgy"" and ""energetic"", but for me, I did not like it that much."
5,Great book!,"I am giving this book as a gift, and it looks really great! It has fun pages that teach different drawing techniques, which are great for any level of artist, or someone that wants a fun book. Very happy with product!"
5,Amazing!,"I'm a psychology professor and this DVD is a great addition to my class. Not only does it discuss the Milgram experiment (and re-create it), but it discusses the Zimbardo prison study (complete with video excerpts from the original experiment). It also discusses the Abu Graib prison situation in comparison to Zimbardo's study and has a brief interview with Zimbardo.Another interesting fact is that the re-creation of Milgram's study differentiates between male and female subjects. It also interviews subjects afterward and questions them about their behavior. Truly great for an hour video and for the price.Also explanatory enough to be fascinating for a ""layperson"" - my husband loved it!"
5,Excellent Resource,"This is not a commentary, but an excellent topical outline of Proverbs with the complete verses listed out in KJV throughout the outline. My Dad found ""Wellsprings of Life"" helpful and used it in our family devotions many years ago. Later, I recieved a copy of it from my 6th grade teacher and have used it for studying, preaching, and teaching Proverbs ever since. I also hope to use it one day when my little son is old enough to recieve his father's instruction. May God continue to use this resource, and especially His inspired words of Proverbs to guide many into the way of true wisdom and the fear of the LORD."
3,not what i expected,"i was hoping for a breakdown of the book of proverbs,but i am sure i will enjoy just the same."
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"""I purchased a steering wheel cover for a gift & was very disappointed that it did not appear to be a brand new item. It arrived in a partially torn manila-type envelope & sent without any celophane or other packaging. The product itself appeared to be previously used or as if it had been displayed as a demonstration model. It had a musty automotive smell & did not appear clean. This was to be a gift & it was not presentable to be given as such. A big disappointment! I will never order from this vendor again."
5,sheepskin steering wheel cover,I absolutely love the Genuine Sheepskin Fur Leather Steering Wheel Cover (blue)! It is so soft! It makes driving so much better!
5,I love these things!,"I have always had covers on my steering wheels. I especially like the sheepskin ones offered here. There are many colors to choose from. The seller provided the extra service of discussing color options available to me over the phone. The product is certainly high quality, and I plan on purchasing several for holiday gifts."
4,Warm steering wheel cover,"Geniune Leather Steering Wheel Cover - BlackThe one we bought was from Gem Co. Warm, Easy application, comfortable."
3,Not what I thought,"Though the company responded to my question, this item is not thick sheepskin--it is very thin---it did fit my steering wheel--I kept it because I need a cover"
4,Hand Pleaser,"I needed something to protect my hands from extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) due to my arthritis. This not only looks wonderful in my car, but it accomplishes exactly what I was hoping for. No more fumbling with those big plastic things to cover the car windows!"
2,"""sheep hair"" keeps coming off...","Generally, the touch feeling is good. However, the ""sheep hair"" keeps coming off and makes my car dirty...what is worse, you might ""make the fur fly"" in your cabin because the detached fur is so light...if you unconsciously intake some of those fur when you breath, I guess it is not good for your health...anyway, my experience might not be representative (maybe I got the worst sample) but I truthfully state what I have observed.I would still give this product an average 3 stars due to its nice grab feeling and look until one of the customer service representatives really displeased me . Considering customer service is one important component of the customer's experience, I deducted one star."
3,"Material is good, fit for my steering wheel is bad",I purchased this in hope to get something not really cold in winter before car cabin will warm and comfortable with good grip and nice feeling. When I put this cover on steering wheel of my 05 Toyota Camry it was really loose and not comfortable to hold steering wheel.
3,Better than a cold steering wheel,"Pros: The cover keeps the steering wheel warm on a cold dayCons: My family thinks it is ugly. I also find that my hands (on the smaller side) get tired because it makes the circumference of the wheel larger. It doesn't look like real sheepskin fur to me, but this doesn't bother me as I have had other products with real sheepskin that didn't wear well."
1,Bridge CD from ARTWORX,"This is a terrible product. It might have been good in 1985, but is horribly obsolete. Graphics are pre historicly bad, there are no options to speak of. I was looking to replace the Bicycle Bridge with a better version...THIS IS NOT IT !"
1,ARTWORX BRIDGE 8.0,This product is misadvertised as being usable for Windows/Mac. I point out that it will only work with old Macs which have a 9 operating system. The company does not have a Bridge game which will operate on a 10.0 system. My ratings are based on the fact that it would not work on my computer.
3,A reasonably good summer hiking shoe,I do a lot of hiking and have a real problem with my feet getting hot and then developing blisters. I was looking for a shoe that had some ventilation that would help my feet stay cool. The Keen Arroyo solves that problem. The shoe does have a few short comings though. First the sole is made of a harder rubber than my traditional hiking shoes. As a result they did not seem to grip as well. I did not feel as secure crossing wet logs and rocks as I have in my other shoes. Also the holes which allow for ventilation allow more debris to enter the shoe. I had to stop and empty my shoes several times. Finally the elastic laces don't hold as tight as standard laces. This was especially noticeable going down steep inclines. A reasonably good shoe for summer hikes over known terrain.
2,Okay in small doses,"I use this for high schoolers who are learning to do research papers. DON'T try to play this is chunks longer than 20 minutes. The ""humor"" is purely cornpone and the kids found it to be very goofy. The information, however, is pretty solid and is best used to reinforce a previous lesson. Not a substitute for real teaching."
3,Fun album with poor sound quality,"This is a fun album with great songs but the quality of the recording is very low. The sounds is muddy. ""I feel like funkin' it up"" is a great song but this isn't the best recording. ""Big Chief"" sounds a bit better for some reason and this is a fun version of this song. It is strange that songs on the same album don't all have the same sound quality."
4,This rules,My friend turned me on to Rebirth a few months ago and I couldn't be happier for that recommendation. Just saw them for the second time last week in NYC and they are ridiculous live. This album is a great intro to their sound even though it's almost 20 years old.
2,Bulky,"I was mildly disappointed with the weight and bulkiness of this case. Admittedly, it is well padded and very protective of its contents, has a lot of room. I bought it because I had surgery and carrying my laptop and accessories was a problem. Now I find that the wheels alone don't make up for its weight. However, I don't have the experience to compare this to other rolling cases, just carry bags."
1,Awful,This is just a terrible rolling case. The laptop is secured by velcro flaps in the back and are definately not secure. The pockets are minimal and basically you can only fit in one or two thin folders. The pounch for electronic devices is laughable because who really has a cell phone that small? This is a horrible item and I was happy to return it.
4,Love it!,"I wanted a rolling laptop carry case to store my laptop in along with a few other computer products. When I received the case, I was thrilled to see how many pockets and how much storage room there is in it. The wide distribution of the wheels is true to its purpose preventing the bag from tipping from one side to the other while transporting. It's basically what I asked for with a few extra surprises. The price is reasonable for this product. Drawbacks? The only one I have is that it was a tiny bit larger than what I was expecting. It still rocks!"
3,rated pg,"a nice recording of assorted national anthems, not to mention the rather tiresome kiwi ""haka."" those looking for ""barnacle bill"", ""who killed cock robin"" or ""four and twenty virgins"" will be disappointed, but here at last is an album of rugby songs that you could play for your grandmother."
3,kind of dumb,"no disrespect but this book was not what I thought it would be. had to pick it up for a Training & Development class project. My group picked it based entirely on its cover. Turns out it's only 96 pages or so which was a plus but it's not chapters. It's three sections (begging, middle and end of a presentation) and a bunch of tips. I read it straight through so I could do my class project but it says to just open the pages and take random tips. It kind of all revolved around the same sort of things to keep the audience entertained. If any presenter I saw tried any of these tips I'd resent them for the rest of my life."
3,Pretty decent,"It's nice round, sweet blueberry flavor. It's a smidge sweeter/more syrupy than I like so went online to see if it had sugar added. No sugar, but the licorice powder does explain it. I normally HATE licorice, so I'm suprised that I still think this is a decent tea. I don't think it overwhelms the flavor as much as the other reviewer does, but the sweet slightly syrupyness of it does have a lingering aftertaste.I liked it enough, was actually going to give this 4 stars until I realized that I probably wouldn't buy it again, and am unlikely to drink it again except when I need something warm and decaf. If I'm not excited to drink it again, then I probably didn't like it that much."
2,If you are obsessed with Rob Estes then watch this movie...,"I love Rob Estes and think he is super hot which is why I like this movie. If you aren't a fan of his, then skip it because you probably won't like it. The plot is not that good and the writing is worse."
2,Cheap,"Not good for modern slang/vernacular. I preferred the Langensheidt dictionary, but mainly because it has a more durable plastic cover. Of course, this paperback is cheaper."
3,A decent dictionary,I do think that there could have been more time put into the definitions in portuguese to help you with understanding the word. It is still a good dictionary.
4,Portuguese Dictionary,"This book is okay, but not much different than a lot of condensed dictionaries. I bought this hoping that it contained the actual phonetic spellings for the Portuguese words but instead it uses the phonetic symbols. This isn't much help unless you know all the meanings of the phonetic symbols which is like learning a new alphabet."
4,Best of Jan & Dean Remixed,"This compact disk was issued just after the double cd ""Surf City to Drag City - All the Hits"" in 1996. Most of the songs on this cd are pulled from that wonderfully remixed digitally mastered package. The audio quality is excellent. However, there are a few songs on this disk that were not on the ""All the Hits"" package. Those songs, such as ""Tell Em' I'm Surfin'"", are not remixed. It dosen't really make a differece all of the classic songs, like ""Surf City"", are there to please the listener. This is great compact disk for first and long time Jan & Dean fans. The price is also attaractive (and low). Capitol Records special products has issued this disc with a low price point in mind. I highly recommend this Jan & Dean compact disk."
4,Shallow Waters,"I enjoyed watching this tape as much as the first time I saw it on TV, however, the quality of the tape was not the best. Parts of it was very, very dark to almost black. I wish that someone would restore the quality of this program and re-release it on a DVD."
1,The Mouse and Maxim,"As I was reading this book, I was caught by how the voice of Mrs. DeWinter was so flat. No emotion. Then, I remembered it was indeed the style of Daphe de Maurier in Rebecca. She also had a flat, monotone way of narrating the story.Rebecca came to the big screen, and was the movie of the year. Hitchcock definitley would have passed on making this sequel.The only thing that made the book bearable, was casting Olivier, George Sanders, and Joan Fontaine into the parts. Even trying to summon any hateful feelings for Mrs. Danvers fell flat.Page after page of Mousey Mrs. DeWinter never opening up to Maxim. Page after page of a haunted Maxim DeWinter, always standing in melodramatic silence. The polite non-communication for them would have been something for the 19th Century, but NOT after WWII! No wife would have been that deferential and mousy to her hubby!Root canal surgery would have been over faster, and with a better end result!"
3,A good book... until the end.,"I enjoyed Hill's sequel to Rebecca, that is, until the last few pages. Although she is more wordy than Du Maurier, I think that Hill captured the essence of the personalities of the narrator, Maxim, Favell, and Mrs. Danvers. I like how she incorporated lines from Rebecca into the sequel in order to tie the two together. But the ending disappointed me. Hill should have left it ambiguous, as Du Maurier did, instead of making it so definitive. But the book did interest me from beginning to end."
2,Not that good,"The story was ok. It wasn't that great like I hoped it would be. Susan Hill did an average job, in my opinion. In the story, Maxim De Winter is an arrogant, and selfish, and thoughtless man, sometimes. And thats not true. The ending in my opinion was pretty much predictable. Maybe they should write another sequel, this time a different theme. More with Daphne's style, and plot..."
1,HATED IT!,"I thought this book was absolutely awful! I loved reading Rebecca and I also enjoyed the movie tremendously. However, here there was to many long monologues and the ending was terrible. Maxim would have never ended things as in this sequel. As far as sequels, I will never read another one. I debated reading the sequel to Gone with the Wind, but after this, I definitely won't. I have to now re-read Rebecca in order to imagine my own sequel which will end with some happiness for Mr. and Mrs. de Winter. (I rated it 1 star because I had to enter something, otherwise it would have been a ""0"".)"
1,Let's just pretend it never happened!,"I found this book at a library sale and spent a whole fifty cents on it, thank goodness. I was leary of reading it, because Rebecca, to me, is a classic and one of my all-time favorite books. But, alas, I did read it. I can say one good thing about it--the descriptive prose was very good. Susan Hill did a great job of describing the English countryside, the places abroad, and the house. I found the main character annoying and the end ridiculous. I'm glad this is a sequel by another writer and we can just pretend the story ended where duMaurier intended it to!"
3,A Great Read,"If you get it out of your head that this is a different author and has a different writing style and plot you can get into the book. However if you think this is going to be just like ""Rebecca"", and severely compare it, you will miss out on a great book.This book flows with more of a description type of writing style, more than dialog. The characters drift about until they find their final destination to rest. I love the way she describes things in almost a Zen like way. It was a great read, I did not like the ending but the rest of the book was nice."
1,I wish that I had never picked it up!,"My mother introduced me to Rebecca when I was twelve. I've adored the book ever since. I never wanted the book to end, and longed to know what happened to the characters after the tragic fire at Manderly. I was so excited to pick up Mrs. DeWinter. Two chapters into the book, I knew that I had made a dreadful mistake. I felt an obligation to finish the book, and I did. Ms. Hill causes readers to loathe Maxim, to think of him as a boorish lout. The second Mrs. DeWinter reads as flat, neurotic and weak. If I could erase this book from my memory I would. It is a disgrace to the original."
1,INSULT to the original Rebecca novel,"I couldn't wait for Mrs. De Winter to be available and was not only disappointed, but angered that it was allowed to be published. I have had the pleasure of reading Rebecca at least five times in the past twenty years and was always impressed with the main character's strength and maturity when she finally made her stand. In Mrs. De Winter, the author totally lost sight of this strength of character and expected the reader to accept a weak and frightened child bride again. For anyone who has read the original Rebecca, it is clear that this book (Mrs. De Winter) was published to make money on it's success. Shame on the publisher and the estate of Du Maurier for allowing this. Rebecca is probably one of the best gothic novels this century, it even is pivital in a fairly recent Ken Follett novel of the same title, Rebecca, which I thoroughly enjoyed."
1,Hill is no Du Maurier,"The BBC World Service is serialising this book in its ""Off The Bookshelf"" programme. The second episode was tonight, and I was so appalled by Susan Hill's style (or lack thereof), that I thought I'd take a look in here and see what other people thought of the book. I'm not even going to bother to listen to the rest of it. ""Rebecca"" has been a favourite of mine for many years, and all the questions ""what-ifs?"" and mystery woven in the original are tantalisingly left un-answered, providing much food for thought. Susan Hill has not added one worthwhile idea, or sentence or word to Daphne Du Maurier's masterpiece. So the question is, why the hell did she write it? Money, I suppose..."
1,Dreadful,"Since Rebecca has always been a favorite of mine, I was eager to read a sequel. I found Mrs. DeWinter to be extremely disappointing, however. The characterization was all wrong, and the descriptive passages were flowery and overdone. It felt like Ms. Hill was trying to impress her readers with technical skill, showing off her ability to write du Maurier-esque prose, at the expense of the plot. The storyline was trite and predictable and she seemed to have no grasp of the true nature of the characters in the story. The ending was simply awful and seemed tacked on. In short, while Ms. Hill is a capable writer, she should have studied Rebecca a little more closely before attempting to write a sequel. If you're a fan of the classic du Maurier novel, don't waste your money on this flimsy imitation."
2,Do not read this book!!,"The book started out alright, but as the novel wore on I found myself wanting to rip the pages out. No doubt, the author is talented...her talent simply isn't shown in this work. First, the book needed another two trips to the editor. Entire paragraphs were held together by comma splices. I wanted to take a red pen to the pages the entire time I was reading it.The material was interesting enough, but I think Rebecca should have been left to stand on its own."
1,What A Bore!,There was no reason to write this book. It is painfully obvious that the author is striving to write in Ms. du Maurier's style and the result is stilted and comes off as a parody. The character of the current Mrs. Dewinter has not matured or grown in any way despite all her traumatic experiences and this is so unrealistic. Maxim is also one dimensional and his character seems to have been frozen in time. The appearances of both Jack Favell and Mrs. Danvers are so contrived as to be ridiculous. I agree with the earlier writer who found the ending both predictable and depressing. I loved the original book Rebecca and am only glad that I borrowed this sequel from the library and did not spend good money on it. Rebecca fans be warned!!!
1,A huge disappointment,It is rare when another author can take the characters from a classic book and engage the reader. This is not one of those authors nor one of those books. The author only suceeded in making me angry that I had wasted time reading this book.
1,Blah,"Hill should have left a perfectly good story alone. The mystery and just the thought of what happens after the book is the most delicious part. But no, here comes along an author who TRIES to write a sequel. If the names were different, you would have no idea that this was a ""sequel"" to Rebecca."
1,It was awful!,"Although Rebecca is my favorite book, I have to admit that after reading Susan Hill's sequel, Rebecca was almost ruined for me. Du Maurier ended the novel the way it should have ended -- with a sense of conclusion, but with enough left to the reader's imagination that he could imagine what happens next. We certainly didn't need Hill's novel to ruin our images of what the future held for Maxim and his new wife. Also, Du Maurier implied throughout Rebecca that after the couple finally escapes from Manderly and its secrets, they would live contently. Hill completely altered DuMaurier's characters and her message from the ending of Rebecca. I honestly wish that I had never read this book."
1,BORING,"Hill is a good descriptive writer, but in this case the audience is not looking for description, the audience is interested in the plot and what happens after Manderley burns down. The ending shocked me...Maxim comitting suicide!! My goodness. Mrs Danvers should have been left alone. I think Mrs De Winter would have thrown her out of the house and refused to have anything to do with her, the same with Jack Favell. It was just really really really boring. The part of her not being able to have children was very unresolved. I liked the original ending."
5,A must-read for any Rebecca fan,"In Mrs. De Winter, Susan Hill successfully reproduces the style and tone of Rebecca. In the sequel, the reader is able to witness the heroine grow emotionally and become her own person. It is impossible for the reader not to emphathize with her every bit as much as in Rebecca. The intrigue which the characters of Mrs. Danvers and Jack Favell provide in the first novel is wonderfully and chillingly familiar in the second. Anyone willing to accept a sequel to Rebecca wil not find Mrs. De Winter disappointing. Susan Hill is to be commended for undertaking and meeting such a challenge."
3,Not quite as bad as all that,"This book was, as the previous reviewers mentioned, not DuMaurier quality. Yet the book was well written. Its characters were clearly the same people with the same personalities, and the book kept one turning pages almost as effectively as the original. It began slowly, working slowly faster and faster, with quiet interludes in between. There are also many plot twists that make the book and effective page-turner. Fortunately (or unfortunately?) it effectively closes the story, preventing future sequels. A fine book for all that, but not nearly as good as the first. Not for die-hard DuMaurier fans."
3,True to Du Maurier,"In reading both books subsequently close together, I must admit like many of the reviewers I too was dissapointed. Not because the book itself was bad but because I wanted a cookie-cutter story with a perfect ending, and did not get it. Still I believe if Du Maurier had wanted a ""perfect"" ending she would have written it in Rebecca, and *that* is what tantalized me into reading Mrs. De Winter. I found the book's characters true to their original form, even though I was muchly frustrated with the narrator's lack of self-assuredness. Yet, this was also true to form. I enjoyed being taken back into the lives of the De Winters and would recommend this book to anyone who loved Rebecca."
2,A tedious read,"Having read Rebecca numerous times, I excitedly began this book, however, shortly found it to be a tedious read, with Susan Hill's style ""not quite getting it."" Her wordiness did not add to the story (as did du Maurier's), but instead seemed geared only to add pages to the book; at times I was astounded at the number of paragraphs devoted to description. Not being one to leave a book unfinished, I plodded through the entire novel, finding the ending to be unsatisfying. I would have been better to have left well enough alone -- letting my imagination create its own sequel."
3,More of the same,"Although this novel was very well written and Hill managed to emulate Du Maurier's tone/style extremely closely, there was just more of the same thing. The couple come out of exile, buy a place in Britain, try to start a new life, it doesn't work out, too much guilt and old ghosts that won't let lie. Yes, it was a lovely story. Yes, it led us further into the wiles and woes of the De Winter family. No, there wasn't really a new direction or move to the story. The new Mrs De Winter remains nameless and slightly insipid, hiding behind her husband and unable to cope with the slightest hint of challenge or difficulty, apart from selected sparks where she demonstrates some character. I did love the description, such as that of their new place, Cobbet's Brake, and the wisdom contained within the story as the new Mrs De W. learns a few lessons of her own."
2,What was that??,"I loved Rebecca, so I decided to buy Mrs. DeWinter and Rebecca's Tale. Both were a disappointment. The book seemed to ramble on and never get to the point; later I realized that the book really didn't have a point. I guess that'll teach me not to buy a sequel to a book that's not written by the same author. I should have paid attention when DuMaurier said at the intro of Chapter two, ""We can never go back again,..."". I kept hoping that the ending would make up for everything else, but it never happened. It was filled with quotes from Rebecca, however there are numerous inaccuracies throughout the book. If you are determined to get this or Rebecca's Tale, I suggest you either just check them out of the library, that way you won't waste both time and money, or buy it as cheap as you can."
1,Not for ardent admirers of the original,"I don't think ill of Ms. Hill's writing style and I must confess I admire her bravery in tackling this sequel. I am one of those readers, however, who fell in love with the world of the original novel and feel that I should warn like minded souls that they may be shocked at the paths these well-known characters are made to travel in MRS. DE WINTER. I was so saddened by the last chapter, in fact, that I could not bear to pick up REBECCA and re-read my favorite passages for some time.I believe that this is the bottom line: If you are looking for something to pass the time and like Ms. Hill's other novels, this may be for you. But if you are a true fan of Maxim or the second Mrs. De Winter, this book may sour your memories."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"This is such a boring book. Hill needs a lot more creativity. She's basically writing about nothing in this book. Everything is so redundant and the heroine becomes VERY irritable and annoying in this book. She panics over stupid little situations and loses every bit of her likeableness from the prequel Rebecca in this book. Those who read Rebecca, remember how we all felt some sort of pity for the girl? Or at least we didn't dislike her. But in this book, you just want to jump right into the book and slap her for her stupidity. And the ending, I don't know what else to say besides that its just plain STUPID. I can't believe I used so many ""stupids"" in a review, I've never done that before. Don't even think about buying this book. Use the money to buy any other book."
1,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would!",Anyone who like Rebecca should not waste the effort on this..... It's poorly writen and NEVER should have been published. Isn't the ending of Rebecca good enough? Isn't Mrs.DeWinter smart enough to stay away from Rebecca's cousin? A waste of money! Don't buy it.
3,"Eh, it was okay.","I felt that Rebecca that should have been left the way it ended. I was sincerly depressed by the ending. I enjoyed it, Susan Hill is a profound writer but Rebecca should have been left alone."
1,"boring, awful, a disappointing sequel","A good book should never have a sequel, end of statement. In this one, the majority of the pages are spent talking and thinking about things the reader either could care less about or already knows about from Rebecca. The ending was stupid and not how you want it to end after reading Rebecca. Overall, it was one of the most boring and pointless books that I have ever read."
1,This sequel should never have been written,"Rebecca is a classic. Classics should not have sequels. Just as there should never have been a sequel to Gone with the Wind, there should not be a sequel to Rebecca."
3,Not what I expected,"I felt that the style was very true of something that Du Maurier would write, but the end greatly disappointed me. I feel that Maxim de Winter was too strong a person to kill himself, he didn't give in before so why would he now."
1,Pointless,"I absolutely loved Rebecca and Susan Hill could just not 'do' Du Maurier. The whole first two tapes (or about the first half of the book) is utterly pointless! The are just wandering around Europe and being Completely paranoid. The only reason I'm giving any stars is because she does write descriptions of things well, I enjoyed the last 3 sentences of the book, and the narrator was good. Other than that I was really disapointed. If you haven't read this sequel yet, I would suggest you not and keep the ending as Daphne Du Maurier left it. Beleive me a flaming Manderly is a better end than this novel disastor."
1,Terrible,Don't waste your time. I am trying very hard to forget I ever read it. It can ruin the original Rebecca for you if you let it.
1,Terrible sequel,"I love Du Maurier's Rebecca book, but this sequel is just terrible. The writing style is good with its gothic mood. However, the story is pale, the characters are all mad. Why does Mrs de Winter never grow up? It has been years since Mandaley was burnt, and she has overcome the most terrible experience and fear. Moreover, she has travelled around the globe, and still she remains a terribly nervous child. I wish I have never read this book."
4,Rebecca... Mrs. DeWinter,"Very much enjoyed this book as a sequel to ""Rebecca."" Susan Hill did an excellent job picking up where Daphne left off with the original. Couldn't put it down!"
1,Biggest disappointment,"This book wasn't terrible, but I'd been hoping for a lot more. As a huge fan of Rebecca, I was disappointed that the book seemed to take the first couple hundred pages to even form a plot, and the plot that formed was weak at best. The characters are not developed. Basically, who the characters were in Rebecca is all they are now...or at least you assume that because they are not really described in any way. The dialoge is extremely wooden, which is disturbing to me because I loved how dialoge flowed in Rebecca. Du Maurier's writing style is somewhat captured, but weakly.The ending left me wondering why I bothered to finish the book. I was hugely disappointed because what I hoped to learn from a ""sequel"" wasn't touched. Instead, this is a weak immitation of Rebecca."
1,"""And Still They Swing on Wires"" is more like it...","How anyone can still believe this BS is beyond me. Even a cursory look at the films show the ""spacecraft"" to be obviously swinging back and forth on wires. The axes of the ""flying"" objects always remain aligned with a hidden point out of frame which just happens to be the same as the center of the pendulum arc of their path. Voila, swinging.The fact that nearly all of his followers have fled (including his wife, as the book admits) should say something as well. For me, the videos are enough."
4,A Gift for Mom,"Because she loves Ms. Randle's Mountain CD, I bought this on a no-reason whim -- along with the Mahalia Jackson tribute CD -- for my shut-in Mom. She was surprised and delighted with it. So, while the very capable Ms. Randle may not approach the level of gospel greats such as Mahalia, Mom's reaction was reward enough for me."
5,Easy to install,Easy to install. Brakes feel a lot firmer and these brake lines are great for use in auto x.
2,"This upper ball joint was listed as one that fit my vehicle. It did not fit, and was forced to buy one locally.","Moog makes a superior product and that is the reason for my preference when replacing OE parts with Moog. The trouble with this particular part was that when ordered it showed this would fit my vehicle. It did not fit, and I had to return it for a refund. I had to purchase one locally at considerable increase in price since I already had the old part out and ready to go in with the new."
4,Not quite the correct sized ends,"I bought this replace the strap on an old polar pacer. This is supposed to be the proper replacement, but the plastic ends are smaller than the originals and the fitment is sloppy. I simply replaced the new ends with the old ones by sewing them on and it works well now."
1,NOT EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED,"I can't rate this video since it was not what I had thought it was. Just want to let everyone know that just in case you were trying to order ""Two Brothers"" (the story of the two tiger cubs...) THIS IS NOT IT! It is actually a video with three stories about gay life."
3,Ya shoulda stopped halfway...,"I love Hawaii, I live here, I study Hawaiiana, and this is a considerable contribution by Davenport, and a good, rich, throbbing story too. And well-written. But why didn't her editor insist that she stop at the halfway point? It's vastly too long, many too many generations. From the great reading at the beginning, it degenerates to repetitiveness and errors and extreme politicism. A lesson to all of us: stop when you're ahead."
4,great read,"I got this to read while traveling in Hawaii which made it even more enjoyable. Isabel Allende's praise on the cover was all I needed to trust it would be well written and captivating. Didn't realize there was a glossary for the Hawaiian words until I finished the book, definitely utilize that!"
2,"Well writen, but incorrect Hawaiian history",This book has some beautiful writing and a decent plot. As someone who grew up in Hawaii during the times when this story takes place I resent that this fiction book presents Hawaiian history in such a biased manner. It was hard for me to enjoy the book knowing that many of the situations were in fact not true and that many readers would believe them to be true Hawaiian history. Remenber the book is fiction!!
4,Full of rich history and spellbinding storyline!,"When I first read the first chapter of this book, I didn't know what to think. As I read on, the more I got engrossed in the novel. Usually novel that constained a lot of historical background turned me off, but Davenport did a wonderful job of incorporating history with fiction. I could relate to a lot of the identities presented in the novel. This novel was easy to read and it's a fun read...but if you don't understand the vocabulary, it might be a little difficult. There is a small glossary in the back and as long as you use it as a reference, there should be no problem. Not much fiction is written about the Pacific region, and this is a wonderful contribution to the rim. This book was a bit long, but it was a wonderful book. You should read this. You'll enjoy!"
2,Got Bored,"I live in Hawaii, have studied Hawaiian history, love all things Hawaiian, loved the beginning of this book... but by the middle I got so bored with it (I thought it was very repetitive) that I just stopped reading it, and then had no desire to continue on. I tried going back to it two times -- it just wasn't what everyone made it to be."
4,Gabriel Garcia Marquez does the Sandwich Islands,"This book was in the ""Hawaii"" section of a Border's in Kaui. While most of it takes place on the big island of Hawaii, I read it in Kaui, which has some pretty heavy spirits of its own. It is a great story, which you can experience at the plot or spirit level. The book runs a bit long, and could use a bit more editing (I think we hear about the drive up the Kona hills with the long village names more than once). I am not sure if I would read this in Cleveland in the winter --- the thoughts of tropical islands might drive you beyond the reaches of even Proza"
5,Shark Dialaogues,"I am reading it now. For those of us who live in the islands, it is very informative. I think it might be hard for those who are not familiar with the Hawaiian terminology, but there is a glossary in back."
2,poorly written!,"While I can understand the reviews that call it poetry, she loves flowery words. The first half was interesting, I have read many books on Hawaiian history, so it was nice to see her use it in the book, but the second half is just plain painful! She seems to forget what she wrote previously, Pono can't be pure blooded because she has started the book with her grandfather being a white man! Even the description on the back cover contradicts itself. By the end I hated every character in the book. It's very poorly written. I got so sick of the every other paragraph sex descriptions, usually with people they hated.. it was disgusting. Don't bother! If you want Hawaiian history there are much, much, better."
2,not what you expect...,"If you're looking for a book about people and life in Hawaii, this is NOT it. The author tried to do too much in one novel. The story covers too many generations, often falls into a narrative history of the islands, and contains passages of reminiscent thought that are irritating. I admire the authors efforts to produce a book about her heritage, but she romaticizes and hides the truth of the islands and I was very disappointed. Sadly, people from the mainland will believe this is how Hawaiians are-- exotic, tragic and submissive to sexual desires. I expected a lot more, but I could not even finish the book."
1,"Depressing, negative, and gross","I had to write because I am amazed that no one yet has commented on how graphic and gruesome this book is! Four women in my book club couldn't finish this book because they were so grossed out by the gratuitous scenes in it. Yes, you will learn a bit about the loss of Hawaiian culture and what the Hawaiians have suffered at the hand of foreigners, but every minute detail of this book is negative and depressing. There is definitely a lot of doom and gloom in this book. Horrible, graphic things continue to happen to all of the characters throughout the story. Yet, the characters do not seem to overcome their shortcomings and misfortunes; instead, they succumb to them. I thought this was going to be a book about strong triumphant women, but instead felt it was a depressing lesson in Hawaiian history that missed an opportunity to garner the respect it should have."
1,Half a step away from being a Hawaiian Harlequin romance.,"This book is an enormous disappointment! It is especially disappointing because it has the potential to be a really good read. But, Kiana Davenport is way over her head with this novel. The characters are one-dimensional types rather than real people. The chapters are so short and abrupt and shift from character to character so quickly that it is impossible to spend enough time with any one character to get to know them. The imagery and use of language are flat and unimaginative. Most of the time I felt like I was reading a Harlequin romance about Hawaii. The only saving grace in this novel is the truly interesting information about the history of Hawaii. But, if you're interested in Hawaiin history I recommend finding a good history book and avoiding the painful experience of reading Shark Dialogues. I felt obligated to finish this book because my book club selected it. Of the 6 women in my book club, all but 1 hated it as much as I did."
1,Inauthentic voices,"I cannot believe that anyone could pass off a work as authentic when it's content and context are so clearly inaccurate. I acknowledge the fact that Shark Dialogues is a work of fiction and that Davenport, as do all writers, has a certain amount of ""artistic license."" However, the glossary alone is incredibly misleading where it is not outright wrong according to everyone I know in Hawai'i who has seen it. This is the worst novel I've ever read about Hawai'i."
3,Passionate But Flawed,"I loved a lot of this book and found some of the passages almost poetic. I loved all the history and mythology of her family and her beloved islands. The writing is beyond erotic; It is total sensory immersion. Unfortunately Davenport repeats her own gems over and over as if she cannnot believe her own cleverness. To make matters worse, her research is horrendous. By the time she gets to Australia she makes gross, inexcusible errors - such as declaring that Darwin is the capital city of Australia - sorry Kiana, that belongs to Canberra!! I quickly lost interest and belief in the material. The book is sloppily edited and typos abound, but her heart is in the right place. A brief study of the REAL history of Australia - perhaps with an actual visit there, a great editor with a working knowledge of grammar and about 150 pages less, this would have been a work of genius."
5,This Hawaii could not be found as a tourist,"Having made three trips to Hawaii and knowing how this book would certainly want me to longingly return it has sat on my shelf for some time. I am sorry now I waited and could not put it down. The Polynesian people are written about with the kind of writing which is so rare these days. My heart broke over and over as I read the history of these magnificent people who were to typically cast aside in favor of the white race and what they wanted. Find the ""soul"" of Hawaii here and the respect the Polynesian people deserve. I am honored to have read it."
1,Bad Experience,"This picture of the box is very misleading. It shows the previous product which was very good. Instead you get the newer version which is very different and not good for the same purposes. Now I am out $5.00 for returning it. And I have been charged $35 late charged to my account. And no refund so far since I returned it. And Amazon could care less, just want to be able to charge more fees than even the original price. Nothing on earth can stop you from charging these fees. This is an extreme disincentive to buy anything from Amazon."
3,Hours of boredom---Minutes of brilliance,"I bought this book due to the rave reviews I had seen. I was largely disappointed. At times the writing is brilliant, but most of the time Moorcock is just coasting. I'm not objecting to the largely idiotic plots, that is part of the charm in fact, it's just that they really don't ever go anywhere.I think this is the kind of book that probably seemed wonderful when you were 17 and stoned half the time. It does not, however, age very well. I kept coming back to these stories over a six month time span, but never could get more than mildly involved with them. I enjoy experimental writing and stretching the limits of credulity, but these stories just pick at the fringes."
1,disappointing,"I did not finish reading the first book in this compilation or any further, I did not wish to waste any more time on what seemed to be books written mostly for shock value in the '60's. I would give this zero stars if I could. However, most of Moorcock's other work is fantastic fantasy that is quite enjoyable."
2,Darned if I get the point here,"I've read Moorcock before and usually like his writing, but I'll be darned if I can 'get' Jerry Cornelius. Between stories, he seems to morph into a completely different person who happens to have the same name. The stories aren't great, although it very obvious that they were written in the 60s and defined a trippy lifestyle.Nah, pass. I read 3 of the 4 stories in this book already and was ready to give up by the end of the first. I was just too stubborn to stop..."
3,Looks Over Functionality,"A very attractive watch. The problem is the so-called chronograph - it's almost worthless, as it merely ticks off one-second intervals. Also, the chronograph hand moves slightly, depending on the angle of your arm as you wear it, so it almost never lines-up exactly with the markings on the watch dial. I've had mine in the Jacques Lemans repair center twice to try to remedy that and have been told that it can't be ""tightened"" any more to prevent the slight movement, as to do so would begin to interfere with the functioning of the hour and minute dials. The dial face seems kind of rushed and cheap, although it does keep accurate time, and has a substantial case, rubber strap and metal clasp that are of high quality, and a cool industrial, racing look. If the chronograph is important to you at all, I definitely do not recommend this watch."
4,Introduction to Shirley.,"This is a good introduction to Shirley Bassey. The album has nothing new for old fans, but new fans will sure enjoy the grandeur. The CD includes only 10 tracks (rather condensed) but all songs are best of... recordings. 'Goldfinger' had to be included."
2,What the....?,"What happened? This used to be such a great series! Now, it's like they're just slapping it together without a second thought. Too bad they're getting lazy. There's some truly amazing chill floating around and it would be nice if they'd pay attention. My major peeve is that they've started repeating some songs, most notably the one by Sarah McLachlan. Why do they always have to include one of her remixes anyway? If they're going to do the ""repeat thing"" why not Starsailor, BT or Thievery Corporation? Anyhow, I'll forgive and forget(this time!) and hope that future compilations will be up to snuff."
2,disappointing.,"i was very disappointed in this cd. i've loved other cd's from this compilation series - chillout 02 and 03, especially. i only liked a couple tracks from this cd at all, and others i really didn't like at all. some tracks i didn't even consider chill out music at all. the worst one, in my opinion, was the postal service remix of phil collins's song, ""against all odds."" it was TERRIBLE."
1,ultimate garbage 06,"I just finished listening to this album for the third time and it still just won't sit right with me. I tried hard to find what the producers were trying to get at with this compilation.Too many up-beat songs! This is supposed to be a chillout album but it's mostly just junk laying around on the studio floor that an escaped drunken chimpanzee put in order.Track 11 was the best one for me and the first one is awesome, but that's a given with Delirium. Piss poor all around. I owne 02-06 and this one was slapped together and not well thought out.Shame on the producers!!!! What were they thinking?!!Skip this one if your looking to get the complete set. Learn from others mistakes. That's the point of the review system right?"
2,Good photos BUT...,"... I was expecting a lot more from it. I think it is a shame that Portugal's anti-terrorist wars in Africa (Independence movements?? B.S!) where badly studied. And being portuguese, I could also sense some ""white kaffir"" mentality surfacing.But the photos are quite good.The book itself is little more of a colection of photos and some stories joined together without method."
5,Very Cool!,"My 11 year old is a huge Harry Potter Fan and I surprised him with this last Christmas.. He went nuts! He didn't even know this action figure existed and carried it around showing everybody. 3 headed dog is pretty cool to other 10 and 11 year old boys!! Very durable, thick, strong, not flimsy plastic like other action figures that can break easily. He has had it a year, still together and he still plays with it!!"
3,not bad,"When this book says it's from Novice to Pro, I expected some advanced notions. It covers many topics, but very briefly. It is not a bad book, and is a very good read for someone who needs to get basic introduction and coverage on .Net topics. It covers basic Objects and Classes designs, encapsulation, inheritance, namespaces, webforms and web services. I reckon the price I paid (CAN $37 ) is way too high for this book, but I gave it to some people who needed an introduction for ASP w/.Net and they found it useful. Basically, if you need to do some advanced projects forget this, on the other hand if you need to learn some simple concepts go for it, but wait for the price to drop."
2,Emphasis on the 'Beginning',"If you are not an introductory user then this book is a quick read and overpriced. The subject matter was well selected but the depth of content, writing style, and cookbook mentality was disappointing."
1,This book is useless,"This book is like a brochure, it doesn't teach you anything, every topic is only covered in a few pages with literally no example. What a joke, I am returning this book."
4,Great Show,"Eps 19, 21,22,2319. Duchess's Day Off21. A True Reflection22. Eternal Dreams23. A New Nightmare"
2,Can I get a refund?,"It was not what I expected, at all. I do want to send it back for a full refund. I was showing it to some friends so we can learn and dance and enjoy it but we didn't even want to finish the first DVD."
3,Good on its own,I enjoyed it but not as much as the movies. When you watch you expect it to follow the movies. Same characters but I was annoyed with the changes. I thought it would be more of a continuation or other adventures that happened in between the three movies. If they made it into a series then they might be able to fix this. It was fun though.
4,Very good pellet,"For my indoor shooting it is a very good pellet. Acurate an with good power, I am using it on all of my guns, no problems except Target Pro 953 - problem chembering."
2,end over end,"These lead-free pellets hit the target and often leave a hole that shows the pellet is flying end over end rather than flying point first. They are not as accurate as lead Crosman wadcutters, with a spread 2-3 as wide from the same gun. Not all airguns like all pellets, so your gun may like these pellets, and the spread may be gun specific. However, the end over end flight pattern seems a problem in my Bronco. The Crosman wadcutters leave a nice round hole."
4,"Well Done, Daisy","I am shocked and pleased to say that this is the first pellet container I have ever encountered that had zero warped pellets inside! They were all uniform and fired perfectly.Now, accuracy is definitely another matter. If you are a bit more serious than plinking for fun, I wouldn't recommend these; they simply aren't as accurate as most lead pellets I've used. It is for this reason I removed one star. I'm only a plinker for fun with friends, and these fit the bill perfectly for me, they were lead-free and gave a good few hours of fun. It really is close enough for bottles and cans, which makes it great for me. Be warned: once you are more than 30 feet away the accuracy really reaches a new low. They are best with 25' and under.I recommend purchasing a container to see if they fit your needs, then stocking up on a few if you like them because I guarantee if you get a few buddies over you'll burn through these in about 3 hours, maximum. :) Overall, I was happy with these pellets."
4,What's with the gloves?,"This is really a small gripe but the toy depicts Jason wearing yellow gloves, just as he had in Jason Lives.In The New Blood he wasn't wearing gloves. They had rotted off. This Jason is supposed to have rotted dark hands with exposed bones. They got it right on the 10 inch doll, but thats over 200 bucks."
4,A place to begin,"I'm a wandering Jew looking to get back to my Jewish roots and make my peace with the religion of my birth. I have some emotional issues from my Jewish secular upbringing that I need to work on before focusing on any classical texts. Upon discussing my personal situation with a Rabbi from [...], he suggested that I study 'Opening the Tanya' as an initial stepping stone. Most likely I will be studying the other books in this series and then moving on to the Tanya itself.I'm presently reading 'Toward a Meaningful Life' which is great."
3,not for sansa clip,"this charger is too strong for the small sansa clip, plug it in my car and it made a scary noise thru the speakers i unplug it right away and my clip was ok. i think it might be good for bigger mp3s."
1,Loud Static Noise,"I cannot use this while my Sansa MP3 is playing music on auxiliary in the car. If I plug in the car charger, the music stops playing and there is static noise. So I can only charge the player while I listen to music from my cd player or the radio. SanDisk says I should be able to listen to the MP# player at the same time as it is charging. They sell the Macally brand charger on their own website. My car is a 2007 and I've had no problem using my cigarette lighter to charge my phone."
4,yes and no,"i love the doll but i hate the dress! I am a my scene and bratz fan, i mean come on people can`t you like them both? stop the fighting it is soooooooo annoying! if you want to fight over it then go to a chat room! if you have any comments on my review than please post it on this website."
5,Sooooooo gorgeous!!,"I love her! She is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo pretty!Madison looks great in purple and blue. I have a ton of Bratz dolls so i thought i would try a myscene, and i love her!Madison is my fave! Soon i am going to get the myscene party pad that in canada comes with a myscene MM madison and i cant wait! I am going to pretend that the myscene and bratz are best friends and theyre all hanging out at the party pad. go girls!Sarah"
1,wow copycats!!,this is such a copy of bratz formal funk! and another thing wat in da world is 'dress to impress'?? eww myscene are sluts
1,We don't have to like them both,"We don't have to like both Bratz and My Scene dolls if we don't want to. You know if it wasn't for Mattel, everyone would have liked them both if it wasn't for Mattel copying whatever the Bratz dolls do. That is why not many people like My Scene dolls because they always copy everthing Bratz do. We would have liked them all if it wasn't for Mattel copying Bratz. So, Bratz are better. And this doll is ugly and so is the clothes. She is stupid."
1,"I love Madison,But not this one.",This doll is realy ugly.Her clothes are not that beautiful.(...)She is the best Madison doll ever made.
2,R-rated version too short,"This appears to be an edited version of a very spicy soft-core flick. This DVD only appears to be 73 minutes long, while the version I saw on Cinemax was 88 minutes long.Needless to say, I haven't picked this up and am still waiting for an unrated version to come out at the proper film length.Very nice and lengthy scenes, with the popular Susan Featherly, who goes under the name Jen Dike here and looks like supermodel Elle Macpherson. A couple of other hardcore stars appear here, such as Lauren Montgomery and April Flowers, who goes under the name Diana Espen for her softcore appearances.If you want the full, unedited cut, avoid this DVD version."
1,parts missing,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas and a box came to my house ""1 of 1"" and it is only the coil springs. I am waiting to see if the rest of the items come later or what. I have not been able to find anything out. I will change my rating if the rest shows up. Please help me clear this up. I saw it being a ""kit"" not just springs and the photo with write up clearly support the fact of a ""kit"" with listed items. I am the second person with this problem and I copied his complaint."
3,Read This Review,"So #1 good job to suzanne and edwin for buying FABTECH FTS44001BK and thinking it was an entire lift kit. Thats a part number ladies... To anyone interested in this kit, just look up the Fabtech part number and you can easily find this lift kit. Ranges in 350-450$ if I recall"
3,These are NOT their greatest hits....,"PLEASE don't buy this as a curious music lover just starting to explore their career. Their greatest hits album contains ACOUSTIC live versions of Radar Love and When The Lady Smiles, NOT the originals. What were they thinking? It also includes some painfully mediocre tracks from their cover album, Love Sweat. And if you're going to pick the best songs off of Face It, WHY would you choose Angel and Johnny Make Believe? What about Legalize Telepathy?? Bah. Gotta See Jane is a great cover, though."
4,history of pop music on 1 cd,"Formed in 1960 and still rollin' strong in 2002.this cd gives an excellent overview of their career and is particularly interesting 'cos you can see how the group's music style evovlves and changes over the years always setting a trend or trying to follow it. from mersey beat to acid rock to psychedelic songs,even sometimes jazzy ones,loads of straightforward hardrock:their No1 sellingpoint. including ""When the Lady smiles"" [...]Even the other dinosaur band from the '60 ,Rolling Stones dig the Eaaring,you know?They sometimes soundcheck by playing""Radar Love"" Thumbs up for this living legend group, who unfortunately are so succesfull back home (their acoustic theatretour sells out since 1993!)that they don't yet feel like touring the US They were asked to open for Deep Purple in 1996 but refused,we can only guess why.So visit Amsterdam, The Netherlands and see a show of one of the best livebands around.hearing is believing"
2,Only worked good the first time,I loaded this into my comptuer as soon as I got it and it worked for one printing job only. I tried to reloaded it and it is not working at all. Will not buy again.
3,"A good guide, but falls short","On the plus side, the Eyewitness guide is easy to read and gives you a more accurate idea of what to expect at the various attractions across Ireland, and has a decent section on Northern Ireland, which is often noticeably lacking in many other guides. However, it is VERY limited in terms of its listings of lodgings, restaurants and pubs. I bought the guide while living in my husband's native Northern Ireland on the recommendation of a friend, but found I had to continually refer to other guide books to find hotels, B&B and restaurants that normal people (those of us with incomes under $100,000/year) can afford. Also, the listing of hotels, etc., at the back of the book is rather frustrating, as you have to flip back and forth many times to determine if there's an accommodation, etc. near where you want to travel. Basically, it's a good companion guide, but not very effective on its own."
5,The indispensible guide to Ireland.,"I bought 5 tour books before I left on vacation and THIS was the book I refered to the most - it never left my bag. It is comprehensive and broad in scope - I would never have visted some of the sights I DID see in Ireland without the promptings of this author and the stunning photos, and I would have missed wonderful things. I even used a few of the dining and pub recommendations and was consistantly pleased with what I found. I used another, excellent book to locate B&B's but for touring Ireland, NOTHING surpassed this book. Also, the pictures are so wonderful that it makes a great ""keepsake"" after the trip. Highly Recommend."
4,Nice photos.,"Really a great guide to help you sort out what type of attractions you want to explore since it included so many nice photos of the various attractions. I agree with other reviewers that you certainly need a detailed road map to travel across Ireland, but this book was used to plot out our travel plans from start to finish. The survival section was a nice primer to read before the trip, since it discussed what to expect in terms of basic needs. Really a great guide."
4,Must have for first time traveler,"I bought this book in preparation for a trip to Ireland, not only our first time there, but our first time in Europe. I had heard the Eyewitness travel books were wonderful, which is why I selected this one. I was not disappointed. It was incredibly helpful; pictures and text."
1,A Waste of Money,"I bought this book together with Rick Steves' book in order to plot out a trip to Ireland. Rick Steves' book was very helpful but when I finished I had a feeling there has to be more and hoped that Eyewitness Travel ""Ireland"" would fill in the holes. Well, was I disappointed ! I don't know who would find this book useful other than perhaps an archaeologist or geologist. It is jammed packed with details of all the items I don't care to see and very little of what I'm interested in, like what are the interesting regions to visit, what are the interesting towns to visit, where is the good lodging and dining. So weird, they give you lovely photos of the things you might want to see and then all they have to say is a sentence or less about it, and even then it's focused on the objects historic or pre-historic value. A great book for gathering dust in the back corner of some giant library.Ireland (EYEWITNESS TRAVEL GUIDE)."
3,Not Impressed,"Product arrived in good condition, took entirely too long. Sorry, but no book takes over 3 weeks to ship....."
5,Excellent Guide!,"Our family moved to Germany almost 2 years ago. Before coming here I purchased the Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany (also highly recommended). Since then, I have tried a few other books to use during our European travels. NONE of them come close to Eyewitness books. These travel guides are easy to use. They have awesome pictures. I am one who likes to look at pictures to see what is interesting and then read the info. so the pictures are a huge help. The guide for Ireland is just as great as I had expected it to be. The guide is broken into sections and regions. We did purchase a map in addition but for over-all ease and basic facts, the DK books are tops! I will always look to the Eyewitness books first when considering travel destinations."
3,Falling Short,"I thought I had my trip to Ireland all planned out, including all the right guides to get me around without any problems. I purchased this guide along with the detailed version of Dublin and reviewed the books before I left. I was surprised to find just how many holes there were with the maps. It repeatedly seemed like what I was trying to find wasn't listed in the book or it wasn't on the map. The maps, I was really dissapointed to find, only cover small sections of the towns. I would not recommend them to people who are using them as a source for directions. It had a plenty ideas for the kinds of places you would want to see in Ireland, but I found there was much more out there compared to what actually made it into the book. I recomend it as a guide for the big tourist spots and to give an idea about what to expect, but I wouldn't use it for details."
3,Eyewitness Travel Guides,"The pictures of attractions is the major advantage of this guide, but it's not as comprehensive I would like, esp w/ re: to practicalities & loding & dining listings. I used it in conjunction w/ the Rick Steves guide to Ireland, & the 2 together were useful, but neither would've been sufficient along."
5,Gift,"I bought this title as a gift for two friends who were travelling to Ireland for a second honeymoon. I like DK books, so I thought they would too."
4,Great Book; great pictures,"This was a great help in planning my trip to Ireland. It was not the only travel book I used, because it has a lot more pictures than text and history. I suggest using this as a supplement to a book rich in history and text. It's very helpful in actually SHOWING the highlights of Ireland."
5,Travel-tested and simply the best!,"When a long-awaited trip to Ireland was finally scheduled, I went shopping for travel guides. Having never been on an airplane before, let alone out of the country, I was understandably unsure of what I would encounter on our tour. I purchased 2 guidebooks that day and took both to Ireland with me. The other one stayed in the suitcase the entire trip. This guide proved to be absolutely indispensable, not only giving us maps so we didn't get lost on the Dublin streets, but also some of the most gorgeous photographs, bested only by the actual scenery itself. I still have all of our stops bookmarked with sticky tabs. The final proof that I chose wisely --- everyone else on the tour bus had the same guide in their hands the entire trip!"
4,A good response to the decline of public worship,"As an active member in two synagogues, I see the problems that Mr. Hoffman illustrates within his book. I see first hand the decline of membership in the shuls throughout the local area. But, at the same time, I also see a rebirth of some sorts of worship. Mr. Hoffman speaks about how to alter the service, and make it more interesting. Yet, I feel the most important way to get people into these houses of worship is not to exactly change the format, but to change one's family life. Mr. Hoffman does have very valid points, although if you infuse a spiritually traditional home with a warm loving home, you'll automatically solve some of the many problems as Hoffman illustrates in this book."
3,he should be very thankful to Miss Kittin.,"I picked this up a while back because I love Miss Kittin. Unfortunately, the tracks without her vocals are rather bland and do not hold my attention. ""Rippin Kittin"" is amazingly good, as is ""After 8,"" but Golden Boy's instrumentals aren't catchy or original enough to warrant repeated listens. Miss Kittin's work with the Hacker and Felix da Housecat are much more satifying."
4,Golden Boy With Miss Kittin - Or,"Cheeky Swiss electro from everyone's favorite electroclash babe, Miss Kittin, and her collaborator, Golden Boy. OR is appropriately peppy, starting from the futuristic automobile ""Autopilot,"" and even into the icier tones of ""It's Good For You to Meet People"" or the cute stop-start reggae off-beat of ""Campari Soda."" The self-referential lyrics on ""1234"" is clever, but the instrumental tracks seem to lack that spark that Miss Kittin brings. Just listen to the creepy serial killer lyrics of ""Rippin Kittin"" or the toothache-and-giggle-inducing ""After 8,"" and you'll hear the difference. The instrumental ""Kopfstand,"" in particular, seems to go on too long. The additional mix of ""Rippin Kittin"" makes what's disturbing danceable. Which is disturbing in itself."
1,No ball included,"Very disappointed with the product and should have read the product description more carefully. No bowling ball included.I purchased the product 12/05/06, have made 3+ calls to the company and still no assistance with obtaining an authorization number (which is needed to return item). Disappointed with product and company."
1,"Simple, Rustic, Plain with Some Paint & Prints","After reading the great reviews, it was shocking to see all the photos and ideas are actually very ordinary, simple and rustic, with a bit of bold paint here, a bit of fabric with prints there, nothing new or interesting. There's 57 pages of recipes that didn't look too original either. Why are so many books filled with mostly ordinary, simple ideas? They deem us to not already know them ourselves??"
2,Distant Regions,"The great anticipation with which I waited for the arrival of Rethinking the Region was matched only by my disappointment at its focus and take. Readers hoping for the defining treatise on New Regionalism will, like me, be sadly disappointed in this expensive collection of essays on southeastern England. Sure, there are some important jewels amidst the thick jargon and back patting, but those thirsting of the how's and why's of regionalism, particularly in the American tradition, will need to continue to look elsewhere for refreshment."
3,"Good, inexpensive HTPC enclosure","This is a good, no frills SFF enclosure. I installed an nforce 6100 based mini ATX board without issue, and the box looks handsome in a AV rack.When I got the enclosure, it was rattling inside- the power LED was hot glued to a clear plastic section and came apart. I reglued it in place and had no trouble since, but thats a bit low class...before buying this board, understand that it does NOT TAKE FULL HEIGHT PCI CARDS! I had to get a low profile TV tuner card and machine the bracket. As long as you're comfortable with that, this enclosure is for you."
4,GREAT Kid's Game,"This was one of my favorite games as a kid! I cannot tell you how many times I played, and replayed, and replayed again. The educational value is great; I remember knowing about the Conquistadors and tapirs before anyone else in my second grade class. It was fascinating how I could go back in time to visit Henry Ford's rubber plantation or talk to a biologist about the kudzu infestation. The graphics may be low for a kid used to hi-def precision and god-mode simulators, but the game has great entertainment and education value. I really recommend it."
2,"Good info, bad game.","This game contains interesting and accurate information about the history of the Amazon region. However, this is the only good thing that I can find to say about it. It is almost devoid of the stategic elements that make Oregon Trail enjoyable, and it's buggy to boot. It's good it's availible for under five dollars from the marketplace sellers, because any more than that would be highway robbery."
3,"Still a good game, but","Had a little problem loading the game, but I finally got it to work. Gave it 3 stars because you only get a small box in the middle of the screen which shows the game. Would love it if the game played on the whole screen."
1,doesn't work,This product should get zero stars. The claim that it works on Windows 98 is untrue. Now I have to waste my time to box and send it which I won't do because it isn't worth my time. You guys know that few return defective products so you don't care.
1,Amazon Trail 3rd disaster,"This game kept crashing. The grandchildren were not happy. When it did run, they enjoyed finding the animals and food. They need to update this game."
3,More Educational than Fun,"The Amazon Trail 3rd editionInstallation was quick and easy. Works fine with Windows Vista. A wealth of educational information! Not as exciting as The Oregon Trail, but perhaps playing a higher level of difficultly would get us to the adventurous decision making, problem solving, and assignments."
1,lousy buy,"have owned this game before with no problems to speak of..but this purchase is faulty. The disc freezes up, keeps slowing down, skips and then closes itself out. Wish I hadn't bought it."
4,EDUCATIONAL,MY SON REALLY ENJOYS AMAZON TRAIL. IT IS A VERY EDUCATIONAL PRODUCT. I AM PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE.
2,Hmm....,This game is fun at first but it gets boring after a while. I don't really understand how to play! It doesn't come with any instruction manual or anything.
2,I don't know!!,"I really don't know how I would rate this item! I can't use it, on my new computer, which has Windows 7, and needs to have a game compatible with 64-bits. I hope you have some new games like this, out soon!!"
5,BEST GAME EVER,I LOVE THIS GAME! The dialogue is ingenious! They do brazilian accents so well! AND THERE IS SO MUCH ACTION! The literary qualities rival that of Gustave Flaubert. They have a realistic depiction of the geopolitical struggles that underly Latin America as well as the historical routes.
1,Amazon trial 3rd edition,"I was obsessed with this game as a child, recently I found it from amazon and purchased it.. I was so excited to receive it in the mail.. About a week later I get an email saying they misplaced or couldnt find the game.. Which really upset me because I was looking forward to it.. Normally amazon.com does really good at getting my purchase to me safely and quickly! Just this once I had some problems.."
2,Who's Not on First,"This could have been a nice tribute to some cherished comedians, but it fails to live up to its billing. The jacket blurb claims it shows the famous ""Who's On First"" routine in its entirety. Not only is this false, the part they do show has canned laughter dubbed over it. This was, unfortunately, the way you probably saw Abbott & Costello movies on the old movie channel when you were growing up. But the unnecessary and joy-killing laugh track could have been removed for this documentary tribute. No other routine is shown for anymore than a few seconds. I pine for the Susquehanna Hat routine or Niagra Falls, but I'll have to find them in their original films (if I can find them without the obnoxious laugh track). Seinfeld's commentary is sadly unfunny and one wonders why he did such obviously weak material."
5,Not Your Average Thriller,"Under the Beetle's Cellar could have been so run of the mill but with Mary Willis Walker behind the wheel (no pun intended) it was eerie. She was really able to write from the mind set of someone in a cult.Walker writes of a fanatical cult leader so real that it could have been a story ripped from the headlines of any paper in the USA. Molly Cates is back and better than ever.Hopefully, Walker will write another one soon!"
3,Not a fan of the style,"I read the book because of all the positive comments made about it. But, I found the characters to be predictable. Also, I definitely don't like the style of writing where MWW tries to convince us that something definitely won't happen - and then it does (e.g., Cates knew it was a dead end, what could this drunk remember after 30 years) and miraculously he remembers plenty! I found several of these instances."
4,I thought the book was a great read!,"I thought the book was a great read! I was looking for a book set in Austin and someone recommended this author to me. This is the first Mary Willis Walker book I've read, but I'll definitely read more. A couple of the plotlines were predictable, but, being from Austin, I enjoyed her use of the city in the book. I enjoyed the character development and the writing style. If you're interested in Austin, I say read her."
5,WOW!,what a ride. this book was an emotional rollercoster of tension. what great suspense! it was fascinating to see into the world of a religious cult from all sides. the characters were amazingly well defined and emotionally compelling. i was so relieved by the time the book ended because it was so draining just to read it you could really feel what was going on inside the bus and outside the compound. enjoy!
5,Like Tomorrow' Headlines!,This book was even better that The Red Scream. I felt as though I were reading true crime instead of fiction. Wonderful
3,Haunting,"As a previous reviewer said, it has been a while since I first read Under the Beetle's Cellar, yet images from the book continue to dance unbidden in my thoughts. I can't explain it, because, though the story is excellent and the writing is adequate, I felt at the time that Under the Beetle's Cellar lacked soul. Maybe it was the fact that I never truly felt for the characters, particularly the main character, a bus driver who, along with 50 children, is held hostage by a religious cult. One of the threads of the story is that the bus driver tells stories to calm the children. I felt that these story-telling sessions lasted far too long. A page or two at a time would have been sufficient. The story was powerful enough to overcome my many misgivings but, in the hands of Stephen King or a host of other top writers, it would undoubtedly have been a bestseller. Yet still chunks of the story still keep floating back into my head. Funny that!"
5,the best book i've read in a while,This is one the best book i've read since reading Caleb Carr's Alienist. I thought that this one out those Red Scream and Zero to the Bone which I thought was also pretty good.
4,more than the average page turner,"I was really into all the characters, here. The author seems to have a sensitivity to human emotions and produces some really touching, as well as devastatingly exciting moments. There are interludes of tenderness and completely unexpected compassion between the bus drivier and the children, as well as Molly and a rather controversial dog who wins her affection. The plot complexity requires some sophisticated reading with allusions to Emily Dickenson and other mind twisting inventions. The allusions to Vietnam and the improbable but understandable humanity of two returning veterans, their love for children and elderly as well as just plain goodness is extremely touching. The author treats ALL her characters with enormous respect and benefit of doubt (where have we seen FBI guys portrayed as human beings?) And the suspense is unstoppable - I read this on a vacation on the Maine coast and nearly missed the lobster!"
5,Riveting. Great ending.,"This story features a Texas charismatic cult leader whokidnaps a bus full of children. The bus driver, forced intothe situation, inventively cares for his charges during their captivity. This cult leader's views are fascinating and disturbing. One knows a scenario such as this could happen, and there are some post-Waco allusions in the plot. I've been reading Patricia Cornwall's books, and I was surprised to find this book better than any of Cornwall's. Don't be put off by the jacket's Hannibal Lecter comparison; it is not gory. Check out this book!"
4,One of the best in the series,"Morris does a great job of integrating the new Winslow family line into this story, and while some spots in the plot are weak, I really loved the characters of Stuart and Leah. This book has a lot to say about forgiveness and hard hearts. The Christian theme in this book isn't as preachy as in the last few, and the powerful message that God can change anyone is emphasized over and over. The only disappointment was that the bad guys didn't ""get theirs"", but I guess that is true to life. Great love story, strong characters, enjoyable plot."
2,Acrylic Wall Mount,"A 1-gallon half-bowl is, general, a convenient and lovely home for a small fish. I have several half-bowls for my bettas.I do not like the design of this half-bowl because the mounting portion is inconvenient. In order to clean the bowl, the mount has to be disassembled. Petco offers similar bowls with a better mount. Those bowls can be lifted on and off of the wall screw, without any need for disassembling the entire mount."
5,Love it!!,I bought this for my son!! He loves it. We get so many complements on it. We have had it for a while now and have had no problems with it.
1,disappointed,"I originally ordered fish bowl with hole for nail on the inside. The 2 I purchased are clearly on the outside with a tab. The reason I ordered those with hole on inside is because I have 8 at home I wanted them to match. Since I received wrong ones, I may opt to buy somewhere else."
2,Too Small,"Too Small,Feels Like A Prison Cell.What Did The Fish Do To Deserve This?I Don't Like It,Sorry.Buy A Bigger Fish Bowl."
1,this is cruel for any fish,This is cruel for any fish to live in. if you want fish on your wall buy a wall aquarium they have five gallon ones made by biorb. And they come in many fashionable colors. have a heart
1,Too Small!!!,"First of all, bettas JUMP. I don't see good outcomes. My female jumps ALL the time. My males are nutorious for jumping at the wrong times (ex: While I'm changing their tank)The size is WAY too small for even bettas. The bare minimum for bettas is a gallon and even then if you can upgrade please do!I would invest in at least a gallon size tank. Please don't be cruel! Look around the internet for REAL instructions on how to take care of your betta. Your betta well thank you for it!!!"
2,Paperport from nuisance,That should be the name of the company. I first started using Pagis Pro. When a new version of Windows came along Scansoft (nuisance). I bought PaperPort 9 and along comes Windows XP and the trouble started. I was able to use it as long as I did so as administrator. With Vista I can still use it but at times it locks up and I have to shut it down. it did not have print drivers and guess what? It isn't going to be supported either. A good way to make customers buy new software isn't it. After reading all of your posts on version 11 I'm thankful I didn't buy again. I think I'll stay with the free software CutePDF. Jim
1,Wow. This product is terrible.,Used the older version. Ran well. Upgraded for 200.00 and it made my system unstable. The program crashes constantly....and they make you pay for Tech support...even to email them. Don't touch this software with a 10 foot pole.
1,Nuance Garbage,"We have used PaperPort for years. I agree with the reviews that say this is the worst release yet. We have at least one crash a day. It crashes all the time when viewing and rearranging pages on PDF's. Half the time the TWAIN scanner interface locks up. This never happens with PhotoShop or even MS Word 2000. We have paid for tech support on three occasions and received foreign based extremely courteous and incompetent advice (seems all too common these days) The problems have never been solved. We upgraded to the Vista version of PP 11 Pro, No improvement. PLEASE Adobe buy PaperPort from Nuance and make it work."
1,The worst software ever,Paperport 11 is one of the worst software programs i have ever used.I would never buy another product from the company ever.
2,slow and tech support is awful,"I have been using Paperport software for about 8 years. The software has always been easy to use and usually problem free. Tipically if you run into a problem it will be at initial install. They you uninstall, run the removal program from their web site, and reinstall. All should go well.Software has always done well for me until Version 11. Maybe they will fix it.I have Version 11 for Vista on my Vista home premium comuter and it is slow, very slow. It also locks up frequently on older files that I have created in the past with Paperport. Such as two or three year old files. This should not be.Tech support is about the worse I have seen anywhere. You get one, only one free tech support call, then they cost. Even email is $9.95 per incident.I would wait a while on version 11, maybe they will fix it, I am using it right now out of necessity."
3,"Fast, but has flaws also.","I have been using paperport for years. I was very happy with paperport 9.0 except that it's slow when opening a folder with a lot of docs.For this only reason, I give it a try with paperport 11. I am very impressed and very happy with the speed improvement in paperport 11. There are other improvements and new features in paperport 11 (compared with paperport 9), but speed is the key that I care most.Here is the downside...paperport 11 does not work with my 4-year-old scanner. After several trials, driver installings/uninstallings, it just does not work with my scanner.So, I end up using scanner on one PC running with paperport 9 and transfer the scanned files to another PC running with paperport 11."
2,Not worth upgrading for,I have used Paperport since 1996 and version 2 so when this software was owned by Visoneer. Don't listen to the hyperbole it is a lot slower than version 9. (my sytem is a p4 running at 4G with 2G of ram SCSI320 RAID 5)Also no longer scans directly to PDF. It scans to .Max and you need to copy the file to PDF. Not a problem if you have a couple of scans but I do hundreds and this slows the process by 50%. The software no longer supports early versions of Vision Paperport and it a pain with the 200/300 series paperports. Take my advise and purchase version 9 and stay with it.
1,Upgrade Was A Downgrade,"I was satisfied with the version of PaperPort I was using for about 10 years; 6.1 Deluxe; but since I purchased a new HP All-in-one with scanner capabilities I thought it would be a good time to upgrade to the latest edition of PaperPort. PaperPort 6.1 Deluxe worked without a glitch using the All-in-one as the TWAIN device, but when I installed PaperPort 11, all I experienced was trouble. I spent greater than 12 cumulative hours troubleshooting the bugs in the software with Nuance technical support via email and they kept wanting to blame the problem on HP. I explained how the older version of PaperPort worked just fine with the All-in-one. After so many hours and headaches, I decided it was time to contact Nuance customer support about returning the software for a refund. At least they have a 30 day return if you are disatisfied with the product policy. I have reinstalled PaperPort 6.1 Deluxe and am happy once again."
1,Incompatibility With Scanners,I purchased PaperPort 11 for my wife to use with her PaperPort Stobe Pro but it will not work (after visiting Nuance's website and Visioneer's website I find out it does not support the Strobe Pro and a lot of older scanners). I have seent an email to Nuance tech support but they have not bothered to respond-I will not purchase any more of their products!
1,"Worse than ever, buggy, resource hog","I gave up on Paperport and Scansoft/Nuance products after version 9 when it was still owned by Scansoft.Presto! PageManager is a much better program and it works with Windows including Vista and it works on MAC.Nothing has changed. The company is still floundering to provide something useful. Even the many magazine reviews I have read are not kind in their assessment. This is not a complicated or demanding task being asked to perform here. Scan my documents, all me to tweak them a bit, then save it to the folder of my choice. Why Nuance cannot provide a product that works after getting you to spend $100 I cannot figure out.I was lucky, I did not have to pay. I got a copy for free. I have worked with computers and networks and fixing them for years. With Vista this program was terrible. Even the most recent updates and help found on the website did not improve the situation.I tried and bought Presto! PageManager instead and have been very happy."
1,Aweful Aweful Aweful product,"This product, once installed, causes your system to become almost unusable. Driver errors occur, the system won't shut down, horrible product. Buy Adobe Acrobat Professional and you will be much happier. I've had over 5 years experience using this product on multiple computers - causes problems on EVERY computer i have ever used it on an with EVERY version I have used."
2,HELP ME,"I am currently a new user to this program. I have found that when I scan reports, even though it is ledigble, the words are misinterpreted by the computer. I'm trying to create a searchable database using this program and the All-in-One search feature. Due to the discrempincies in the text, I cannot do this. Has anyone encountered this issue before, or knows how this problem could possibly be fixed? Any help would be greatly appreciated."
3,Good but not great,"I purchased this product to keep track of the many internet receipts as well as written warranties, bills, etc. I receive. I found that direct web capture will not work with Vista. There is a work-around but it requires a few more steps. Also, it works with only a limited number of scanners. I am satisfied with it but do not think it is worth the high cost."
1,Didn't Work with Vista 64,"After many hours of customer support, the software didn't work with Vista 64. The different Tech Support staff kept repeating the same steps the previous one had given me with no success. Finally in frustration I used the Warrannty Return Policy and returned the software to the manufacturer.Still has bugs with Vista 64."
1,Will never buy Nuance again,"Absolutely no free support even when problem is with the product, not your use thereof. Would give it no stars if allowed.,"
1,Doesn't work with network drives or scanners!,By Nuance's own admission on their website this product will not work with networked scanners. I recently purchased a Canon MX860 (networked) and THEN found out that Paperport won't work with it. Unbelieveable. Their software and support on their website is the worst I've dealt with in a long time. They will NOT get anymore of my money (I purchased full copies of Omnipage Pro 16 and Paperport 11).
2,Why No Vista?,"Do NOT get this if you are one of the hundreds of thousands of people out there who had little or no choice than to get a Vista PC. What a waste of money, time, and patience!"
1,Worst Customer Service of any Software,"ScanSoft PaperPort has the worst customer service of any software I have ever purchased. In addition, the user forums are weak and provide little help. I have also found this software to be particularly buggy and prone to developing problems, so the lack of support is especially aggravating."
1,"Very, Very slooooowwwww","The idea of the product is great, only if it worked as it is supposed to?It is extremely slow, it locks up my scanner most of the time and never remembers my settings; the worst problem is their Technical Support policy, you get one free one, that is usually used up during the installation, after that it is $10 per incident, regardless of if this is their products problem or something you're doing wrong. I don't think I'd ever by another product from these guys."
2,Not Recommneded,"I have used PaperPort 6 and 9 and decided to try version 11. This version is slow as molasses! If you have more than 30-40 scans in a folder it takes a long time to open the folder and if you switch between folders with a large number of scans you just wait and wait for the thumbnails to reload! A huge waste of time. Switching from a file in desktop view to thumbnail view also very slow. The current image stays, then fades away as all the thumbnails RELOAD.I am going back to version 9. I do not have time to sit and wait for version 11 to decide to respond."
1,"Great User Interface, Totally Useless Software","I love the user interface on Paperport, but the software is so buggy it is useless.We have V11 and V12 and they both stink.I wouldn't go there."
1,"Slow, buggy, awkward","I use PaperPort (with XP Professional) primarily to scan documents from my HP d145 all-in-one printer, to pdf files for emailing. I have PaperPort 11, and previously PaperPort 9. Often I have to restart the program due to an unspecified failure which closes it. Version 9 used to scan a stack of documents through the printer's ADF non-stop. Version 11 requires I click a key after every single page. I would love to find something else."
3,student 101,"Although the book came extremely fast, I was a little annoyed that I wasn't notified that some pages were missing(about 10)...other than that the experience was good..."
1,Outmoded,"How sad to find yet another book filled with outmoded notions about breathing, articulation, and other subjects. There has been so much research in the past 20 years about voice, and it's disappointing to think that the uninformed reader may be misled."
5,Ray Vander Laan Early Church,This and all of Vander Laan's DVD's have been amazing Bible Study helps. He puts so much of the history in his teaching that more of the scriptures come into focus.
2,Not built for the long haul,"After two years, this product stopped warming the water to the appropriate temperature and does not force the water through the ground at the proper speed, resulting in crappy coffee. We liked the package and the price and it made good coffee in the past but after two years, we are looking elsewhere from Hamilton-Beach products.We never had any problems with the carafe which performed well."
4,great product if you're careful,"This is actually a very decent, acceptable and useful carafe-based coffee maker. It's true, due to the minimization of moving parts, it has no valve and you can find yourself in trouble if you take the receptacle out while the thing is brewing. Patience.We've only experienced the water-on-the-counter problem once... and it is very easy to protect against. You just have to make sure that the filter basket is securely positioned in it's holder. If it is not, it is very easy for the outlet hole to get blocked and for the water in the filter to overflow.However, once you get past these wrinkles... this is a damn fine, cheap carafe-based coffee maker. With a little attention to detail, you can have great coffee in either one cup, two cups or a whole pot. I really think this coffee maker is worthy of four stars... it is very simple, which is why other reviewers with particularly high standards, give it such a low rating."
1,Defective,"I received this coffeemaker for Christmas. After two months of use, it quit working. I contacted Hamilton Beach and they sent me something to clean my coffeemaker. It still did not work so I contacted Hamilton Beach again. Now I have to cut off my appliance cord and send it back to them along with $6 to get a new cord. Since it wasn't my fault, why should it cost me anything to get my coffeemaker restored. Stay away from Hamilton Beach products."
1,Good Morning Vietnam Review,This CD set was very disappointing. The tracks listed are not necessarily by the original artists. There are one or two good tracks per CD. But as a whole this set leaves much to be desired.
3,A bit dissapointed,"I don't usually purchase things sight unseen, but this camera was an exception. I had only my past experiences with Canon to go by, which I had been satisfied with.I wanted something compact, so the size is perfect for me. I like the widescreen mode. And the camera is fairly intuitive, although I've had to reference the manual on a couple occasions.The boxey shape reminded me of an elph still camera I purchased sometime back, so I naturally assumed it was encased in metal as well. Nope. Cheap plastic feel that I'm concerned I'll end up breaking.But my biggest gripe is the video quality when shot indoors. Even with the light on the picture is really grainy. I'm going to put it up against my old Sony Video8 camera as a test, but I swear the old camera took a brighter picture.We purchased this to take shots of our new baby girl. I've been really dissapointed with the indoor shooting since that's where new parents spend a great deal of time."
2,NOT 100% cashmere !,"The product description clearly states ""100% cashmere"". It is NOT. The label on the shawl states that it is a product of clubpashmina.com and it is ""80% cashmere, 20% silk"" ! For this combination, it is overpriced.....alot ! It looks average and there are far better shawls available in this 80/20 combo for far less money. I know, I ordered some and they are fabulous. I just wanted a pure cashmere shawl for a dear friend. This will be returned."
3,pricey banner,I had difficulty finding any Nemo decorations so when I saw this banner I couldn't resist from purchasing it. It was expensive but helped with the theme of my son's birthday party. The banner is great but not sure I would pay that much again for an item I may never use again.
1,It's bland,"I've listened to thousands of songs, mostly trance if I recall right, and there is only tiny portion of this CD that sounds very good, and it lasts for about a minute or two. The good part is around 73-73:45 then starts to go back to bland."
4,Past and Future!,"Hey -- if David Michelinie and Bob Layton are doing Iron Man, you can rarely go wrong! This TPB features IM and Doc Doom being transported to the past -- King Arthur's time -- and then to the future of the year 2093. (The original comics were Iron Man #149-150, and then #249-250.) The tales are wonderfully woven, script and art both.You may also want to check out a Marvel ""What If?"" that detailed Iron Man's adventures if he was *stuck* in the King Arthur past."
5,I'm on my second,Got this from my wife about 3 years ago. It is quite stunning with the gold 2-tone. The clip broke last month (just after a 10 day trip through Ireland). I have never had a clip last three years before because my number of bills varies from just one or two to several dozen and the clip gets streched and squeezed. I immediately bought the same clip because I liked both the look and durability.
5,Irish Moneyclip,The moneyclip is beautiful and arrived on time. The only thing is I was promised no shipping fee and I was charged anyway.
5,Life Altering and Amazing,"Marge Cuddeback's Vanishing Veil is a life altering book. Not only do you read fasinating stories, but it is garunteed to help you out with some aspect of your life."
4,What an adventure!,"J. R. Lankford's second thriller starts out of the gate with a bang! What a subject! Stealing the DNA from a holy relic & setting about the controversial process of finding a surrogate mother & cloning one of the most revered historical figures.THE JESUS THIEF romps across time & oceans, from sacred sites & cows to secret hideaways & tortured love, dragging converts & killers, skeptics & heroes along in its wake.Suspend your disapproval & get set for a fine adventure! I couldn't put it down!"
2,Disappointed with sexual content,"The Jesus ThiefThe plot was so current and facts seemed to be in line with ongoing investigations. Was really getting into the book-29% on the Kindle. Then blindsided by descriptive sexual content. TMI Too much information. What a waste! As adults some of us don't need smut to enhance our reading pleasure. I deleted it off all of my devises. So sorry there was not an alert, before I got caught up in the tale."
2,"Started Slow, Stayed Slow",The book started slowly - and stayed that way. The characters weren't developed in a way that bound me to them.I couldn't finish the book even though I came back to it a second time to attempt to finish.
2,Predictable,"The concept of cloning and Second Coming's which author Lankford attempts to explore with her novel The Jesus Thief is one of interest; however, like many stories now endlessly focussing on this subject matter, this book too, falls short due to an easily predictable storyline. The character development is good, especially Lankford's 'Felix'. Nevertheless, I feel as if the author could have gone deeper with the storyline, and her intended meaning or basis for which she wrote this book."
1,"Poorly written, waaaaay too predictable.","Lankford needs to admit that this was a story she wrote in high school, no, jr. high school! The plot, attempting to clone Jesus from DNA found on threads stolen from the Shroud of Turin, could make for a great novel. But this one isn't it. The characters are too shallow and unbelievable, and the ""twists"" and ""turns"" that make a book so interesting are totally absent. They're replaced instead by incredible ""coincidences"" that read like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. I finished reading the book only to see if the end possibly could make it all worthwhile. It didn't!Don't waste your time on ""The Jesus Thief."""
4,Great story but unsatisfying ending,"JR Langford wrote a great story about cloning Jesus Christ, I was first worried it would get to preaching and be too religious, but she pulled it off and really made it a good story and really developed some interesting characters. Dr Felix Rossi, his sister, the maid and particularily Sam was well done. The story plot is some blood is recovered (stolen) from the Shroud of Turin and Dr. Rossi works on making a clone of Christ. Of course some people do not want that to occur and the press wants front page coverage. The story moves on at a good pace and is an interesting read. However to me, the book's ending fell flat; I think it needed about 20 or more pages and with more resolution. I doubt if there will be a sequal because there is not enough story left for a sequal without it becoming a religious book."
2,Okay . . . at times.,"Lankford's technical approach to sharing with the reader the detail of human cloning is detailed, however, descriptives of science alone do not make a strong fiction story. The writing itself is mid-level, though there are times Lankford's Felix has you interested in a specific plot movement . . . only to have Lankford's many subplots take you away from what what may be a main theme. Did anyone say FOCUS?"
5,Subtle and Subversive,"Someone passed a dog-eared copy of this on to me and I admit that I wasn't much interested. Religionisn't my thing and science fiction even less so. But I was looking for a way to avoid reading my bookclub's selection, so I gave it a try.It turns out that underneathe the pell-mell flood of action, there's a very subtle deconstruction ofhow we believe what we believe. You could read this just for the great plotline and the suspense,but you'd be missing something."
4,Great book in the style of Jurassic Park,"This book explores the political, and social ramifications of a successful bid to clone Jesus Christ. It's far more than just a thriller trying to get in on the cloning fad, it's a deeply felt study of what would this really mean. A great book and one I can heartily recommend."
5,Outstanding!,"If you have ANY desire to learn JavaScript, then THIS is the book to buy! Incredibly detailed, easy to read (can't say that for most computer books), and your pages will come alive instantly! This IS the Bible for JavaScript programmers... Very appropriately titled"
3,Okay but not really great!,"The book was an okay treatment of JavaScript, but I learned tons more with Netscpape ONE Developer's Guide, which covers both client-side and server-side JavaScript. Goodman's book doesn't cover server-side JavaScript at all. The book also doesn't cover much advanced stuff...The proof is in the pudding. See for yourself"
5,"CD Movie Soundtrack ""Far From the Madding Crowd""","The CD was advertised as used but in excellent condition. When I received the CD, it appeared to be brand new as all the packaging was intact, even the sticky label with the name of the CD on it (the sticky label that you have to peel off before you can open the case). Whenever I remove those labels, they always tear into many small pieces. When I looked at the CD, it looked perfect. When I played the CD, it played perfectly. I am a very pleased customer and would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again."
4,meets the course needs,The text is easy to read. I purchased it as required reading for a doctoral course I am taking. The text covers a sufficient amount of information to complement the course. Would have preferred a softback version as I frequently flip through the text and would like to be able to lay the book flat.
2,ECW S WORST DVD,"YES CLASSIC MATCH UPS BUT TOO SHORT ,NOT ENOUGH TO FILL IN FOR THE PRICE TAG ....PAUL HEYMAN NEEDS TO RELEASE SOME OF THE 3HR PPVS LIKE HARDCORE HEAVEN 2000 .GUILTY AS CHARGED 2000 ,NOVEMEBER TO REMEMBER 2000..THOSE WOULD BE WORTH BUYING MR.HEYMAN"
4,A memorable wrestling card,"This card was memorable for a few reasons. First off, it has the ""Final Battle"" between Tommy Dreamer and Raven, who have been feuding for a lifetime. A very good match, which also has Jerry Lawler, Rob Van Dam, and Sabu appear following it, starting the infamous ECW-WWF interpromotional war. They destroy the entire locker room, until Taz clears the ring. That brings us to the next memorable match, Taz vs Shane Douglas for the TV Title. A great last minute match. Finally, the main event has The Eliminators defending the Tag Titles against The Dudleys. Good match, but its really memorable for Perry Saturn's elbow drop off the top rope. That's memorable because Saturn is in a leg brace, due to having a torn ACL. The rest of the card is good, but these are the main reasons to see it."
5,Vikki Carr it must be him/for once in my life,"This is one of her best,especially the live section...has great connection with people there like at the Greek and I was there"
5,Love Vickki!,Great album! All the super songs and she is perfection! I love Vikki and these songs are some of her best.
3,Bigger and heavier than some men's watches,"Very beautiful watch, but it is huge and very heavy.I wore it for 3 hours and could not get used to the weight. I like big watches, but the weight on this was so distracting that I'm returning it.Also, not all of the crystals are straight on my watch, even though it is brand new."
1,Arrived Scratched,I ordered this watch as a gift saving about $20 buying it from Amazon rather than Macy's. After receiving it poorly packaged and scratched I returned it and went to Macy's and paid the extra money for a NON SCRATCHED WATCH. I WOULD NEVER BUY A WATCH FROM THE INTERNET AGAIN.
1,Not what I expected!,"I selected this watch for Christmas and received it from my husband. It is a great looking watch if it was half the size. The face is huge, the links are huge and it weighs a ton! It also came all scratched, so that leads me to believe it will continue to get worse. I'm sending back..."
5,Organizational Ingredients,"The ability to stick to a core set of values and at the same time be sufficiently adaptable to meeting changing situations is the secret to success for any organization. To discover the ingredients of this secret, read this fine book by Ackerman."
2,Tabs are small and it didnt last long in the bathroom,"I tried using these to tape a fogless mirror (plastic) on the shower. Covered the whole back with tabs. Only lasted a week or so. I see these being usefull with paper and posters, but thats about it. I am searching for better adhesive products."
2,bad advertising,i am normally much too busy to read the fine print --- the advertised photo showed a rather large square mounting tab that i took to be its size --- i received it today and found out that the photo really shows 9 tabs instead of the one --- each tab is tiny --- i did think to myself how they could pack 60 into one package --- well now i know that each tab consists of 9 smaller ones --- i was thinking to receive large tabs for mounting purposes --- but it turns out that i should have been more aware and read the fine print instead of simply looking at the photo...
4,Worked as planned,We used the mounting tabs to affix a sign to a podium. It worked perfectly. But I am glad we got it right the first time because the sign could not be repositioned once affixed.
2,Weak,"The adhesive is terribly weak, the foam is extremely lightweight and deformable (maybe good in some applications but not for hanging posters or items having any weight), and it's very hard to cut with normal scissors. I'll stick it in the back of a drawer and will probably never use again."
5,amazing,"they dont look like much, but they work extremely well.very impressed with those, they are ideal for posters but also heavier stuff."
1,Terrible,The only way they'll work is if you use all of it. Wouldn't even hold one of my posters for more than a couple weeks.
1,Weak,"These are supposed to be relatively strong? They can't even hold up my ~virtually weightless~ foam pads that I've spent hours hanging. Now I'm just watching as they all fall down one by one... slowly but surely. Not to mention that the tabs almost come apart when you're trying to pull the cover paper off of them. These are just awful.I'm not normally one to write a bad review, but I just hate these a ridiculous amount."
2,Strong Glue. but poor material for taking it out.,"Strong glue but the material is of poor quality.It is getting peeled off and the rest stays in wall I am having hard time getting it off from wall, Which is not good for me. I may need some solvent to remove the leftover to cleanup. I would have recommended this one if the quality of the tape was better."
2,Painful to wear!!!,"""I gave these earrings 2 stars because although they are very beautiful and look expensive, they are difficult to wear. The earrings are incredibly tight on the earlobes. My earlobes are average, so its not a question of having thin earlobes. Granted, they will never fall off, but they are painful to wear. I will try to stretch them a bit, because as I said, they are truly beautiful earrings. """
4,really nice,really nice and original earrings with beautiful stones . They have more expensive look than the funny 15 euro I paid for them
2,Disappointed - requires expensive subscription,"My kids love this program. I was very happy that I purchased it - but I did not realize that it only comes with the first two levels. So for $20 you get your kids hooked and they very quickly master the games in the beginner levels and they can't go to any new ""worlds"" unless I pay $8 per level. Very Disappointing!! I thought I was buying a package. I would have gladly paid a flat $39 -$49 for an all-inclusive package. But $20 plus $65 (that's the bundled rate) is too expensive!!! (I have a kindergartner and a second grader so I'm in for $170 for both ""worlds"".) I'm sorry that I bought it. My kids find so many excellent educational websites for free!!!!"
3,"It's all true, or mostly true . . .","My 6 year old loves it, and for entertainment and educational value I would have given the product 4 stars. However, I was a bit shocked to realize I had to fork over more money so my child could continue past the first two sessions. Maybe it did say that on the box, but I missed that part. I paid the additional dues, and my son loves it. When I buy a child's software, though, I don't want to have to connect to the Internet to use it, or pay monthly fees to use it. I haven't yet experienced customer service like the others have."
1,Will never buy another Jump Start game,"As others have mentioned I feel absolutely duped in shelling out $20 dollars for 2 levels. While it does mention on the front of the box that additional lessons available with membership fee I really feel that having only 2 included is not at all worth $20. I absolutely refuse to sign up for the monthly service charge as if this was a MMORPG or somthing similar for kids. For kids I expect the entire game upfront and no BS monthly charge to complete the game. Horrible, horrible company that I will never do business with again."
1,DIRTY! and caused a huge fight! DONT BUY!,"The box makes the game sound like you have unlimited access and that is partially true. You have access for only the first two lessons! True your child can continually play the same mundane games over and over, but all messages to your child are to keep going. My daughter was heartbroken when I told her that I was not going to keep paying a monthly fee.You are basically paying a premium price for a TRIAL. It's dirty and I will not buy anymore Jumpstart games.Buyer beware."
1,Horrid Scheme,"This is a terrible childrens product. You have to register online just to install the software. When registering, you must give them many personal details, such as address, birth-date, etc.. (not optional). You add photos to your account (presumably of your child), which likely are uploaded to their servers. After installing, the software won't even run unless you know how to configure your windows firewall for the product. There is really no need for them to have access to all that information, and grant them unlimited access to your computer to be able to send files in the background to their servers. All I want is for my kid to be able to play the game that we paid for."
2,only 2 levels included,"the 2 levels included are fun and GREAT for learning. my child advanced quickly through them and now, we are prompted every game to buy more levels. i have had problems in the past with cancelling subscriptions so i am very wary. think i will stick with the original 2 levels and call it a loss. too bad, i would have purchased more jumpstart product..."
1,Waste of time,"My 5 yo daughter and I are both dissapointed. We've tried installing this game on 4 different computers, and even had our neighbors try, and it just keeps shutting down. I'm surprised a product like this came from Jump Start."
2,"Good teaching material, but awfully buggy software","My 3-year old likes to play with this software. I think its educational contents are great. Unfortunately, it is full of bugs that stop it from running. I have to reinstall it every 2 weeks."
4,good product - terrible support,"my daughter loves the game. it's very educactional. She's only been able to play the first level, even thought the box clearly read you get two levels. The software companies support is terrible, I've been trying to get help from them for almost a month. They continue to tell me I'll be contacted, I'm still waiting."
2,Beware of Subscriptions,"I liked the product; my daughter learned a lot. Now I am trying to cancel, because every time she uses it, our credit card gets charged $7.99. I had to search for how to cancel; the website says cancel by calling a long distance number (not an 800 number). The number has a long, long wait on it. I have better things to do with my time.Buyer, beware."
1,Jumpstart blackmailing parents to buy a subscripton.,"All of the Jumstart World 3D Adventures require you to purchase either a yearly[...]or monthly subscription[...]to have access to the other levels that are not included in the original CD purchase. Please note that I said it gives you ""access"" to the other levels of the game. Once you quit Subscribing your child can NO LONGER PLAY any parts of the game that they previously downloaded & played during the subscription period. After you unsubcribe your child only has access to the first 2 levels again that came on the CD. You have to have high speed internet access available at all times in order to play these games. You can't use them on the laptop in the car or on the plane. You can't play them while your internet connection is down for pete's sake. Why would anybody pay that much money for something you WILL NEVER ACTUALLY OWN?"
3,Smaller than expected,Worked fine - daughter's 8th birthday with a hula theme. But they were smaller than I was thinking. Probably if I'd read the description with a ruler in my hand my expectations would have been more on target!
4,SS Turkey Fryer Kit,"Bought this unit primarily for brewing beer; the turkey fryer parts are a bonus for me. The burner delivers a lot of heat to the pot, and there is plenty of regulation available for the burner. However, I'm disappointed in the thinness of the pot material as I hoped for a more sturdy pot. Some apparent tousling during shipment caused a significant dent in the pot, but I was able to pop it out. Bottom line, though, this is a terrific value, about 40% lower than if I had purchased all components separately."
4,Visible & tangible seam in pot,Just received this product and there is a visible & tangible seam in the pot from top to bottom. I have never seen a stainless steel pot like this.
3,Flaw in pot,"Fryer seems to work fine. However, pot arrived with a small crack near the bottom that I only noticed while trying to heat oil and watching the pot leak onto the burner!Amazon taking over 2 months to ship new one."
2,7 series sampler reveiw,this is the track list1.nothing on my back2.fat lip3.rhythms4.motivation5.in too deep6. handle this7.pain for pleasure
3,King Britt,"I was looking for a certain song that was on this cd. It was not the version that I wanted, but after listening to the entire cd I found some other songs on it that I liked."
1,totally overrated,"The Leonidas chocolates being peddled in the USA bear little/no resemblance to those available in Europe. After enjoying Leonidas in Germany (Aachen and Munich) for many years I placed an order here in New York State. What I received was (a) crudely presented boxes of (b) thick, hard-shelled (c) anonymous flavoured cream centres. With the exception of the coffee creams (which were more or less as I remember them from Europe) the rest of the box seemed to consist of two undefinable centres. Extremely disappointed with this order. The Godiva selection my mother received for Christmas was FAR superior in every respect -- packaging, presentation, appearance, texture, taste. I won't buy Leonidas in the USA again."
5,Leonidas- TOP NOTCH CUSTOMER SERVICE,"This company not only has a great product, but they have top notch customer service. They made a mistake on my order (which happens!), but THEY found it (they didn't wait for me to find it), and THEY fixed it over and above my satisfaction. They communicated with me as well as the receipient of the gift and they were great. I would recommend them if you plan to give chocolates as a gift."
1,Bad Decision to use this company,Chocolates arrived at my mothers house with ashen sheen on them. I was horrified they received expired chocolates....This proves you don't always get what you pay for...
3,"Very good, but not fantastic","O,K. Leonidas is one of the best Belgian chocolate makers. Alas the ""pralines"" they make in Belgium are not for export (too much whipped cream and perishable ingredients). What they sell in America is the not so perishable stuff (hence the nuts and chocolate cream). That may be why so many reviewers evoke Nutella. I sent a box to my brother who spent time in Belgium as a teenager. He was very happy, but pointed out that there is more to Leonidas: white marzipan with a wanut on top, strawberry marzipan and, of course the pistacchio whipped cream, etc..Leonidas remains a good option if you like chocoalte.Somehow my previous review was taken off. Hope this one stays."
3,"eh, just ok","I purchased the Leonidas Chocolates from Amazon about a month ago. My wife and I love chocolate. After reading the raving reviews I felt this would be a great gift. The shipping was very quick, so no complaints there. The chocolate had a nice flavor, but we were not impressed with the fillings. If we had to choose, the hazelnut was the best in the box, followed by a white chocolate that was good. For the price, you can find better chocolate elsewhere."
4,Very delicious!,"I ordered these chocolates for my girlfriend a few weeks ago. The only problem I had was that Amazon said it would take 3-5 days to deliver, which was great because I could receive the chocolates and give them to my girlfriend and surprise her, but they delivered them the very next day.Other than that, great product. Beautiful packaging and great taste. I would recommend these for sure but be aware of the shipping time and expect them faster than 3-5 business days."
4,robotic rock,"I got into Buffalo Daughter after hearing ""Great Five Lakes"" a few years back. I hadn't brought anything until I brought ""I"" the other day. I was blown away by their sound. As a big fan of Cornelius and Cibo Matto (artists who have collaberated with BD), I'm now a fan of theirs. An amazing album."
3,El cuaderno de Noah,"Buena novela muy entretenida te fácil lectura y muy interesante, se las recomiendo comprenla, no se van arrepentir, a me gusto.!!"
5,"El Cuaderno de Noah, by Nicholas Sparks (Spanish Edition)","I think this is a wonderful book, because, in spite of being written by a man, it expresses so much feeling. The book is all about feelings - a wonderful love story. It made me cry."
2,Poco hilado,"La idea del autor era buena, pero me quedaron muchas lagunas y dudas regerente a la historia, me falto un poco mas en el relato."
4,Unpredictable!,"Very touching, human. You want to keep reading and at the same time don't want to finish it. A good companion.Del suelo al cielo (Spanish Edition)"
4,Fun product,"Used this on the beach. Didn't find a darn thing that was worth anything, but was fun trying. tested it on several metals and it detected all of them with the proper settings. Easy to use and reasonably prices."
4,I can't believe i'm the first to review this!!!!,"Its hard to believe no one has reviewed this fine peice of death metal yet. Decapitated are one of the best metal bands to come out of Poland(I like them more than Vader or Behemoth) and one of the better bands in the entire scene. They came on to the scene very young and ""Nihility"" is their second release. In my opinion it is there best. The production is not as strong as some of their other works, but the songs are a lot tighter. ""Spheres of Madness"" is my favorite Decapitated song. The double bass part together with the technical gutiar is furious and brutal. All of the songs are very technical in nature with lots of fast balst beats and great riffs. Sometimes the songs roll together a little, but not too bad. The vocals are pure death metal. Sarun(who is no longer with the band) has a great gutteral low. He never really leaves that style, but it works with the music. All together a solid technical death metal album!"
1,Not Really Useful at All,"I bought these to go on my Pack n Play changing table. However, they're very small - the cover only the middle section (the padded part) of the changing table! I returned them and I'm going to use disposable changing pads and a waterproof pad, which works just as well instead. These are cotton, not waterproof. They do have holes for the changing pad's buckles but my PNP does not have them! I wouldn't spend the money on these again."
1,Cheap - don't waste your money,"I bought these for our Windsor pack-n-play - not only are they small and not waterproof, but after 1 wash they are falling apart! Spend your money on actual waterproof pads!"
2,Not intended for a regular size changing table,"The item title is misleading this is not a ""changing table pad cover"" but a ""pack 'n play changing table pad cover"" intended for some type of portable changing table. It will not fit a regular sized changing table."
2,Would be better if water resistent,"These are nice and soft but would be much better if they were water resistant. Had to keep another pad on top of this to absorb the accidents, which pretty much made this product unnecessary for us."
2,"Sorry, I was sleeping, what did you say?","I guess if you are a hippie from the 60's, or enjoy music even more mellow than John Denver, then you may like this CD. However, if you are looking for some good rocking music, or at least some mellow music with lyrical substance, than this album is not for you. I assumed this was going to be a bluesy folk album, but Lullaby was so boring I almost fell asleep. I suppose if that is what a lullaby is supposed to do, it did the job. Don't waste your time and money on this album. If you want this music, just go down to your local coffee shop. There, you only need to buy a cup of coffee vs. the 15 bucks for an attractive yet expensive frisbee."
3,if norah jones was less asinine and more richly tectured...,she'd sound a bit like pieta brown. this is a slow rainy day record that will grow on you. not an all time classic but still well worth checking out. somehow she's both smokey-sultry and earthy-folky. thats pretty cool.
4,Uniquely contemporary,"For minimilist folk music, this record feels uniquely contemporary. It feels like the still strong, steady heartbeat of the ""rest"" of America, away from the cacaphony of television, news cycles, and other things disposable. These songs do not fill the lulls but create them, giving us the break we have been deserving of and promised to for as long as we can remember. Some places won't show their charms to a visitor. After going through the cycles for a while you start to feel the pull. A few ups and downs and the beauty is revealed. You probably won't like every single song on this record, but you will love a few and you might find yourself making appointments to listen to them. America needs this music now, and so here it is."
5,Bluesy and beautiful,"This is a breathtaking introduction to what I hope will be Pieta's long and fruitful career. Her charmingly mellow and stunning voice is so full of heart and life in combination with Bo, there are moments I could almost cry... the whole album makes me feel at home; and at peace with the precious little quirks of time. I love it."
1,a Musical Disgrace,"I heard this opera live in Boston. The composer may well be a computer genius, but as a composer he lacks the most basic skills. I suggest he studies counterpoint, harmony, and real orchestration (not fixing up afterwards with computers) from scratch. After the exhaustingly unimaginative pseudo-barroque, nuddle-soup-as-counterpoint openning, in some sort of a D minor, I was already ready to leave the theater. Also as a person with a Russian background I was seriously offended to see Russian peasants singing and dancing to a Celtic-Elizabethan gigue. The opera abounds with mispronounced Russian names (Ignorance begets ignorance!), the vocal writing is awefully boring and cliche at the same time being bland and unmemorable. A singer friend of mine who was one of the soloists complained how poorly the vocal lines were written. If you think Andrew Lloyd Weber is great then you may like this guy too. I think they are both pretty aweful."
1,You are tested.,"Once Isaac Asimov said; ""Gentle Reader, give me the chance to pick and choose among the findings of science, accepting this and rejecting that according to my lordly whim, and I will undertake to prove anything you wish proven."" (The Stars in their Courses)By this book, the author did it!It's full of wrong quotations!!Please try check out them.For example, let's compare this book's account about Mr. Maurice Chatelain and his own in his ""Our Ancestors Came from Outer Space."""
5,From Cow to Store,"Shows milk production starting with a cow eating grass. Focuses on the transporting, processing, and packaging milk goes through to prepare it for sale in stores. Simple sentences are on the left page and each right page is a color photo. Includes a three word glossary and eight word index. Karen Woodworth Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
1,Web Description is Wrong,"The web description of this product has the following bullet under Technical Information:Includes M300(sic)handmasker, FB12 film blade, and tack-down tape dispenser attachmentThe product description section says ""This kit includes one M300 hand masker, one FB12 film blade, and one tack down tape dispenser attachment.""When my purchase arrived it only contained the M3000 Hand Masker. Amazon told me to send it back and they would replace it via free overnight shipping. Second one arrived, and again no blade, just the M3000. Sent both back for refund, which I got with no problem."
3,A Professional Masker,"I returned this product along with rolls of their masking tape. There is nothing wrong with this Product, but its a little over-kill for a home do it yourself painter! I could certainly see the advantage of this for a Professional Painter!"
1,bad paint,all of the paint balls were lop sided or broken the paint didn't fly well at all I didn't expect to get paint like this please let me know what you can do about this
1,Worst Paintballs,%50 of the paintballs were broken during shipping and the balls that werent broke shot like badShot 10 balls and 3 were choped terrible PaintballsSpend the extra $13 and buy some good RPS paintballs
2,ehh...,"First off the balls do not look like the picture given. Im pretty sure there just wal mart strikers. That is a little shady to me. Next they are not premium paintballs, belive me, I know the difference as an enthusiastic paintballer. However, they did not come broken and they do work, so 2 stars seems sufficient"
2,color discription is misleading,"I ordered 2 boxes of 2000 ""assorted colors"" and received 2000 grey balls and 2000 orange balls. The price was good and the shipping was great but the discription was bad. I called their customer service (which was good service) and was told that assorted colors meant what's available at the time. I mean really, would I want 2000 grey paintballs instead of green, yellow, red, blue, orange, pink, assorted colors??? I thought this was really bad business practice. Very disappointing."
5,you get more than what you pay for,I give these paintballs 5 stars not because they are the best paintballs ever but because of the price and because they came in perfect condition. And about performance these ball are decent.
4,Very impressed.,I honestly wasn't expecting anything good from this. I decided I couldn't beat the price so I gave them a try. I guess I just got lucky. The ones I got were teal/orange with white fill. They were just as good as the ones we got from the local store and we got them for half the price. I actually think they shoot a little straighter... but that could just be my imagination. I spent $50 so I got free shipping from the seller and they arrived two days after I ordered them. Overall a great buy!
1,Broken Paint-balls,I received this item on time but I was very disappointed by the quality of the paint balls when I got them. They were not packaged very well to begin with so when I received them 3 out of the 4 bags had paint balls exploded inside of the bags so they were not able to be used I winded up throwing them away.
2,I wouldn't buy these again.,i bought 3 cases i didn't like them they didn't shoot straight and blew 3 or 4.
4,Great and Cheap,"great balls, came really fast so i could actually use them this weekend (hopefully, if i get enough guys together) actually aren't ""assorted"" colors. don't know if they screwed up my order or what but i got 2000 shrapnel brand paintballs. seem fine to me, don't see any dents and looked like only 1 broken ball out of the bunch. can't ask much more for less than $30 hope they shoot alright but i got a 98C so it wouldn't matter even if they did suck 8)p.s. don't know if this is the sellers fault or amazon's: the day i was notified that the paintballs had even shipped, i received them later the same day and i don't live anywhere near these guys.also once i shoot some of these i'll adjust my rating. (they get 4 out of 5 due to fast shipping and the balls look good so far)"
5,SecondPaintballs Are good !,this paintballs are good to play with friends the quality is Ok for normal games !
1,Useless Garbage,"Maybe my first review was not to amazons likes, because it has not been published again. This company sold me good paintballs in the past. Not this time, they are garbage. Or should i say came out of the garbage. What good is a marker ball if there is no color in them. They are sold as seconds, meanings assorted leftovers from overruns. Well this time they had a production mess-up and forgot to put color in the balls. So they pass them off to us people that are trying to save a dollar. Instead we get ripped off. SHAME ON YOU!and shame on Amazon for dealing with them. Ill go to walmart tomorrow and just pay a few dollars more . At least i will get what i paid for."
4,"they're seconds, but theyre great for the price","Hey, theyre seconds...What can anyone expect? Its like an irregular pair of socks, or jeans, not perfect but not awful. Ive gotten seconds from Actionvillage before, once it was monsoon paint and then another time it was shrapnel. Both times i got it though it was good knockaround paint. Nothing i would bring to a tournament, but its great to use for the weekend."
2,Not good at all,"The case arrived inside another cardboard box with minimal packaging padding. When we opened the box to play yesterday, we found that every, single, bag had numerous broken balls inside which had coated every single bag and ball with the paint. On top of that, the balls were filled with a nasty milky white paint, which was barely visible at all when it hit. The price was nice, but you obviously get what you pay for. Will just go to the store next time and get premium rounds and not deal with this level of mess."
3,paintball,"Good stuff. A bit overpackaged (I hate to add to landfills.) But that allowed only nominal breakage, which is always a paintball paint issue with shipping."
1,SUCK!!!,THESE PAINTBALLS ARE HORRIBLE!!! I HONESTLY DONT KNOW WHY I WROTE A GOOD REVIEW FOR THESE BALLS BEFORE....NOT 1 BUT 20 BALLS BROKE ON THE WAY HERE!! NONE OF THESE PAINTBALLS WERE ROUND...THERE WAS EVEN ONE THAT JUST HAD THE SKIN OF THE BALL WRAPPED AROUND ITSELF A BUNCH OF TIMES WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PAINT INSIDE! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE BALLS...THEY ARE A WASTE OF $20
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"These were the worst paintballs I've ever used. Period. When I got them in the mail, all the bags were wet inside and cramped up, bad news. I tried to dry them up with a towel and package them in individual ziplock bags, I thought for a second that I probably just saved them and everything was ok....WRONG. When I used them to go play, what a huge disappointment I got. The bloody things would not break on contact, I tried to break them by squeezing them and they would just stretch indefinitely, they would of worked just fine as testicular implants on my yorkshire. Do yourself a favor and just buy your paintballs locally or buy a sealed box from a reputable manufacture, and all the paintballs were brown for christ's sake!"
1,paintballs,this paintballs sucks they are like gellatine i recommend you not to buy this product you better spend on a $30 bucks paintball box
1,Not worth the risk,"You are better off spending 10 more dollars on normal paintballs. None of mine were broke when I received them, but half of them had knots with soft spots. Basically half of them shoot out okay (not accurate) and the other half break in the barrel. Don't take the chance, just spend a tad more for the real stuff."
3,Nice tunes but . . .,there isn't a list of performers or instrumentation. I like that there are some obscure tunes included. Since no track listing on Amazon as of 7/14/06 here it is:1. An Rince - Craftsman2. Jennie Stevin3. The Level Path - Reeling in the Reel4. Henri's War5. Hills of Tralee6. Old Fitzgerald - Reel Cavanaugh - Kerry's Jig7. Stephen's Cup of Tea - The Clumsy Coalman - Jenkin's Fancy8. Fairy Dance9. Greens Norton10. The Fox in the Valley - Merry John - The Gala Queen11. Speyside Waltz - Waltz for Anne12. The Hooley
1,You gotta be effin' kidding me!,They are going to split up THIS series into two volumes?!?! I may be done buying television show DVD sets. Greedy a-holes....
3,Kinda lame,"I watched 30 Rock again from the beginning. I LOVE it ! Don't understand why I wrote a ho-hum review the first time around. It is smart and funny and sarcastic. Love Love LOVE it. Buy it, NOW. 5 stars !!"
4,Italian vs Spanish version,What can I say? I have 3 of this guys cd's from being in Italy...including this one in Italian. But when a friend of mine got the spanish version...it sounds almost the same. I personally like the Italian better due to the smoother language of italian. Even though they are both a latin lanuage...I give 2 thumbs up for both versions!! Quando non ci sei has to be my favorite!!
1,Misleading book title,"This book is not about architectural design. I bought this to gain knowledge about how to design my house. There is nothing to be learned about floor plan design. Also the author talks a lot about the need of getting a good feng shui consultant(herself I suppose)and is VERY stingy about giving out usefull information. Try Kartar Diamond's books if you want to know more about feng-shui, she is very candid in her writing and generous with her information. By the way, I used Eva Wong's books to help with the floor plan design of my house; it's easy to understand and she has a clear example of her own floor plan design."
3,Not that good,The author spends alot of time saying how much she knows about the subject. But in the end there is little delivered that you can put into practical use. And certainly almost nothing if you are an architect. If you have an existing structure there is nothing in here for you. Suggest you start with books by Eva Wong instead. And if you are looking for some real understanding of how chi flows through structures in a harmonic way one of the best books in English isFeng Shui: Environments of Power - A Study of Chinese Architecture. In that book you will at least find some diagrams of temple design and some hints about why certain joinery or architecture technique can produce beneficial results.
3,You really have to have long hair,"Anything you put in your ears is noticeable. The front still looks somewhat like a blank earing laying on the earlobe suface, especially at 0g where it doesn't sit flush in some places of the earlobe. And the back looks like you have some sort of prosthetic plug stuck in your earlobe. Long hair is key..."
3,LISA! LISA! LISA!,Ok the film is pretty bad (a waste of a talented cast) but you have to see Lisa Bonet in her finest erotic performance ever. I have the NC-17 version (taped from pay-per-view) and its incredible. The sex scenes are so real it looks like it wasn't simulated. If you LOVE Lisa Bonet you gotta see this!!The version thats in video stores is rated R
5,Two Jubs up!,This book is absolutely Juberific! Very help to men so that they can find there true self...
4,...tHe WhEeLs aRe oFF...,"Pure literary greatness. This book exemplifies why Gordon Keith (shock-value!) has become the premiere radio personality in the metroplex area. He has taken the medium and moved it to a higher (seattle sleuth) broadcasting level than where it existed before. It has become quite clear ... that Keith is the talent that drives and keeps the station moving. He is often the main reason the content of the radio show is kept at pace that makes it more interesting ... to listen to.As I sit here in my leather chair, wearing my silk robe, smoking my pipe reading this book, I often think about Gordon and his comedic contributions (gordo's corner) to the airwaves of dfw radio. It will only be a matter of time before the whole nation recognizes the genius (ribby) that is Gordon Keith. Good morning to ya."
4,"Buff gets ""Cranked Up"" in Wise County","This book is great! I ain't laughed so hard since the time I taught ol' Cousin Greggo to tuck his thingy between his legs so that he would look like a girl! Everybody at the feed store, fireworks stand and gypsy methamphedmine lab said that this was some very educational reading for anyone who needed a little direction in life. Gotta go, the baby is chewin' on the extension cord for the old space heater. Don't want to short it out and trip a breaker, now do we? I am cccuuunnntttrrreeeeeeee!"
5,buff book -Gordo,"After reading this book I truely believe that the answers to the questions that secretly plague every man exist within these pages.(oh Jeez)I intend on recommending Buff Tanner to all of my friends that know how to read.(OK Carol)I found after reading it myself that I could now tell where I am from where I was and where I will be from where I wont.Anyway,I really enjoyed the book and Im looking forward to the next piece of Gordon Keith literrary work.(maybe not)"
1,"Everybody heave to, trice up, the smoking lamp is lighted...",I will take this book under advisement.WHAT ELSE?
1,Get out of the cave,"Has anyone outside of Dallas ever read this book? I have nothing against Buff Tanner. I met him in person and he is a really nice guy. However, I don't think anyone other than people that constantly listen to one radio station in Dallas would enjoy this book. It's amusing at the most. It was a chore getting through it. Gordon Keith (the co author, and reason most of these books were purchased) works for ""The Ticket"" , a sports radio station in Dallas. He does little voices and characters for the morning show, and sometimes plays a shock jock. In my opinion, the station targets the white american male born and raised in the south. If you are one of those hardcore Ticket listners that go around quoting ""drops"" in your office and at happy hour then this would be a good purchase for you, otherwise steer clear."
1,ONEOF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ,I bought this book because i listin to the ticket and a friend suggested this book to me but once i read the first chapter of this book i was done i listin to the ticket and am a big fan of Davey Lane but this guy Gordon Keith is just not funny and needs to strongley consider giving up comedy
3,A nice highlight album,"This album is a nice highlight album. The singers are not as good as the Original Broadway Cast or the movie soundtrack. If you are a Phantom phanatic as I am and love to hear different versions and some alternate lyrics this is a good buy. You can't beat the price (only 6 dollars). However, if you are just being introduced to the magical world of the Phantom, I would recommend beginning with one of the others."
5,Better than original cast,"As a singer, I would like to say that the people on this CD are technically better than the original cast recording, and have Kira Bronte has a much better voice with a nice tone and vibrato, and much more open vowels than Sara Brightman. Also, the Phantom is much less breathy on this CD than on the original cast recording. The singers aren't technically perfect, however, but a few allowances can be made because this is musical theatre and not an actual opera. Overall, I liked this recording much better, but I still own both."
1,Received Broken,"I ordered 4 of these items for our company's truck drivers. 2 of the 4 items came back broken. The base on one of the items was broken in half. Another was cracked down the middle. The item design is great.. the holder snugly holds the handset in place, and you can either screw the phone down, or use a sticky pad provided with the phone. However, what does all the matter if the product breaks so easily, right? What a bummer!"
5,The best cell phone car holder ever made !!!,"I have two of this holders for over a year and I love it. I use it in Infinity FX35 '06 and NIssan Maxima '04 with Samsung T-809 and my wife uses Samsung A900, the holder is universal and will fit almost any phone out there ( not pda). I tried many holders before and they were junk , original Motorola holder made with quality , you will not be disapointed. I strongly disagree with prev reviewer, but everyone is intitled to personal opinion."
5,Wonderful book - and the play is so similar,This book is facinating with it's history of American pioneer women. It contains real quotes from real people about the lives that they lived. If you have seen or been in the play you will be delighted to see that some of the show's monologues are word-for-word from this book! I't's a moving book and a moving play.
1,waste of money,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!! It contains NO Sex Pistols music only pathetic synth elevator music. it has an old music journalist who obviously doesn't like the Sex Pistols & belittles their music & place in music history. It also has interviews with 2 fans who were too young to even see them play live - they say interesting things but nothing new or essential. The Sex Pistols footage that plays (without the sound!) can be seen on the DVDs that you MUST buy -Filth & The Fury, Never Mind the Bollocks (Classic Albums) & Great Rocknroll Swindle. Ignore this atrocious overpriced cringe-inducing waste of time."
1,A complete waste of time,"Don't buy, rent or even steal this DVD. It's a terrible waste of time and money. No Sex Pistols music, interviews or even new footage. Get the Great Rock and Roll Swindle or the Filth and the Fury instead"
1,One star is actually too kind,"The graphic design of the cover is several million times more professional than what's on the DVD, which really is just two British guys with no real connection to the Sex Pistols telling you random anecdotes about the sex pistols. Seems like just a cynical attempt to get fans to buy or rent the DVD- they needed to stuff something in the case and this is what they came up with. Looks like they shot it in the morning, edited it at lunchtime, and shipped it in time for an early afternoon nap. Sid Vicious could have done better work in a heroin-induced haze. I made it about five minutes before nausea made me stop and stare at the wall (the white paint was more interesting)."
5,ben gibbard for president,"this is benjamin gibbard of long touted ""best band in the nrthwest"" death cab for cutie singing by himself and with others, playing songs that come from the heart, the mind, and the little child in all of us...love redemption faith and other emotions so key in life are played here in broad terms and easily digested tidbits....this was orginally released a very very long time ago and was out of print since...but the cool kids at barsuk have decided to give all another crack at it, with the bonus footage being nearly as essential as the older disc....their are two unheard songs and a mini movie that will warm the cockles of any heart....very highly reccomended for those that love the indiepop front and even those who are in love with singer-songwriters with guts and pinnache (john vanderslice, bright eyes, neil halstead, etc)...get this record to mend and to be....whole."
3,A Young Gibbord...,Cool low-fi album. Had it and lost it. Bought it again cheap for track 8 and nostalgia's sake.
2,Ben Gibbard has grown a lot as a songwriter.,"There are 2 really good songs on here. The first is ""Untitled,"" which sounds like Gibbard was listening to a lot of Brian Wilson at the time he wrote it. The percussion sounds like it could have been on pet sounds. ""Underwater"" is a pretty good song...but the real jewel on the album is ""Send Packing."" It really is a beautiful, well-written song. The rest of the album sounds kind of thrown together and most of the songs would have been much better if they had been recorded with real instruments. Basically, the novelty of the kid instrument thing wears off really quickly. All in all, I wouldn't spend 10 bucks on it, but a couple tracks are pretty good."
2,NOT AGAIN ANOTHER OVER PRICED ECW DVD,YES THIS DVD IS OVER PRICED BOTTOM LINE ECW CYBERSLAM 99 WASNT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED FROM PAUL E. HEYMAN ....
3,ECW-ECW-ECW,"A lot of matches that occured at this show probably won't be on the DVD, but the ones that have to be are a great six man cage match with Balls Mahoney, Axl Rotten, and New JAck, up against Mustafa, and the Dudley Boyz. A lot of blood and a great jump by New Jack. Also Shane Douglas against Justin Credible, Tommy Dreamer pouring urine on Lance Storm, Rob Van Dam against a returning 2 Cold Scorpio, and Taz vs Chris Candido, there were a lot of matches with jobbers and little known wrestlers (at the time) which probably wont be on this DVD, but should be, this is a good show for anyone who has never seen ECW!"
3,ECW CYBERSLAM 99,"Some really good matches on here. I bought it for the value, and because I still have the ancient VHS format. But like always there are some minor flaws to this low priced tape.----No replays-No original music-buffed out completeley sometimes. No interviews with wrestlers hardly at all. Very cut down, but action packed. Pluses and minuses to this, but I would get it if your an ECW fan."
2,Just Milking It,"The music here is good. The need here is none. ""The Very Best of 10cc"" was released in 1997, covering most of the music on this CD, and yet someone decided this narrower collection still needed to be released. The only two songs on here not on the more comprehensive collection are covers of ""Across the Universe"" and ""Silly Love Songs.""Another in a series of CD releases for 10cc that offer less than ""The Very Best of,"" and were ultimately unnecessary. Pass this one by in favor of the more comprehensive collection."
1,Is There Anything Less Than 1 Star?,"Freemasonry is so religion-neutral that it always fails to measure up against the ""Is-This-A-Religion-Or-Just-A-Cult Test."" It's is neither. It's just a society of men attempting to live life by the Golden Rule. Living a moral life according to the code of any religion should qualify a man to be a member. Masons do not attend lodge to worship; they are there because their values make that type of activity a natural extension of their life. Luckily, I never paid to read this drivel."
1,"1 Star is too kind, what drivel, save your money.","Here is other example of someone attacking an instution that they know nothing of first hand. The author is clearly out to make a quick buck, hoping to capture the public's interest with fear tatics and not facts. I am glad I borrowed the book, as to not lose any money, but I am upset about the time I wasted. P.S. Not to forget the book itself is poorly written and leaves the reader wondering how did they get this published. If you have troubler sleeping get yourself a copy, otherwise have a tooth pulled its more enjoyable. Sorry I can not reccomend this book."
2,Leaves much to be desired.,"This book is basically good for top surface learning of the Masonic cult. If you desire to learn the deep secrets and doctrines of the Masons I suggest other reading. The author did a nice job of pointing out the Lodge as a religion, prayer in the Lodge and doctrinal comparison. The sub-title is how to respond the author terribly failed to give adequate information to respond and witnessing weaknesses and strong points. However it's not a waste of time, any information learned is valuable for correction.Bless Your Spirit, Rev. Matt Yarbrough, Jr."
5,This DVD is excellent. I learned from the video. I will watch it again. It is not boring.,Excellent learning material. I highly recommend this video. I will watch againto make sure I have mastered this subject.
1,Ctp Convergence Technologies Professional Study Guide,This book doesn't exist. It was cancelled by the publisher before publication. But it makes for easy reading! There are no plans by the publisher for any future CTP study guides.
2,food coloring!,"This tastes very good - but has A LOT of un-needed food coloring in it, so I won't be buying it again."
4,A little fragile but lots of fun,"I bought Lofty and some other vehicles along with the Shelter and expansion set of click bricks for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He is a big Bob fan and loves to play with them, but I have had to reassemble the crane for him a few times. For this reason I would not recommend this toy to a child younger than 3; the toy would get bashed by a 2-year-old pretty quickly. I would recommend getting the click bricks expansion pack; it makes playtime with the vehicles more interesting and fun. It holds his attention longer since there are more lifting and hauling options."
4,One of Whitney's best balads ever!,"Taken from her good but short but excelent album Just Whitney... On my Own is a emotive balad produced by the always great Babyface, with an incredible arrangement! With Whitney's voice in an good type this is the best of Whitney's best balads since her last album mY love is your love(98).it got me thinkin 'in i will always love you. a good song, that i hope it got sucess to make a ignition to lastest wHitney's work , cause she deserve."
2,Could I have some cheeze on my white bread!,"This song was designed to be an anthem of some sort like I Will Survive, but falls short about a thousand paces. It's like a bologna & cheese sandwitch on white bread! I would like to know exactly what Whitney is ""trying"" on her own? lolThe remix is more tollerable musically, but still the ... same, corny lyric. Next slice from Just Whitney should be One Of Them Days."
2,"Shallow, fragmented and dated.","The book's back cover claims that ""Researchers and postgraduates in the fields of digital signal processing, statistical data analysis and telecommunications will also benefit from this extensive reference."" I find this book very disappointing. Its signal processing development is unusually inexact even for beginning graduate students. Its exposition is often verbally vague and mathematically unrigorous, with rather shallow technical depth even for engineering students. Its theoretical framework seems fragmented. Its bibliography is dated and anecdotal. As an active researcher in this field, I would not recommend my colleagues to use this book."
4,Da Bulls,"Since I bought a Blackhawks' Stanley Cup compilation DVD, I thought I should at least get a comparable DVD of the first NBA championship by the Bulls."
4,Almost Perfect,"This is when I became a fan of Michael Jordan: The Chicago Bulls first NBA Championship run. Michael is the greatest player to ever play the game, and his first NBA final with the young and hungry Bulls was nothing short of ""spectacular"". The only reason I give this set 4 stars instead of the full 5: clearly missing is the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals between the Bulls and Detroit Pistons (who knocked the Bulls out of the playoffs for three straight years: in the 1988 Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, and both the 1989 and 1990 Eastern Conference Finals...a true rivalry in every sense). The Detroit Pistons 1988-89 Championship DVD set has all six games of the Eastern Conference Finals with the Chicago Bulls, and the Pistons' four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. Regardless, this is a must-have for any Bulls/Jordan fan."
4,Good NBA matchup,"The dvd set itself is good for the price, but it has inaccuracies regarding the locations. Seeing Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen in the beginning of the domination of the Bulls is impressive. The series itself was a tough series for the Bulls because eventhough it was just before Magic Johnson retired he was still very competitive at that time in his career."
1,This DVD is missing 2 whole sections as advertised,The DVD here skips the Library and on-line research section and goes straight to outlining. This is why it is only 26 minutes. Do not buy this if you need the Researching part of the DVD.
3,Color notice: This fan is really purple!,"In my opinion, this fan is clearly violet or purple. It is not blue. If you are trying to match it with other shades of blue, forget it."
3,Baltimore Ravens,"If you are creating like a baltimore ravens themed,room this is the perfect color fan for it because the fan blades are PURPLE/VIOLET they are not blue. Think Baltimore ravens. Anyway, I ended up going to wal-mart to buy blue spray paint, about two cans about $5 bucks. Took about 30 minutes to spray paint but it but if finally looked Blue when i was done. The light bulbs look purple under Soft white light But under daylight ,which i plan to use. I just installed the fan 5 minutes ago. It running now, very quiet no vibrations. my next step will be finding Daylight intermediate bulbs for this fan. I have a feeling ill be looking for a long time. If I could go back in time, I'd keep the chrome fan with white blades that i bought with standard light bulbs for like $35-40 bucks at lowes and paint the blades blue. :-D at least standard light bulbs are common and cheap."
1,Ceiling Fan,The color was deceptive in the picture.The color was blue but it was more of a purple color. It looked cheap for a Westinghouse product. We did not even put it up. It is still in the box and it probably will end up in a garage sale.
2,Great looking - odd light size/motor hum,"This unit looks great - my daughter liked the silver blades(other side is blue) and purple/blue lights. I put it up - no harder than any other fan and turned it on. The motor has a loud hum which is worse at low speeds. We do not have any external remote control or anyhting else wgich could cause this. We are calling Westinghouse to ask for a replacement motor.And now for the lights. It uses an intermediate base light bulb. Not standard, not the small one often found. In the local Home Depot there was a choice of exactly one type of light with this base - a 40w spot. This is a real pain. ALso the lights are fixed - no aiming as far as we can tell.Having said all this, the unit looks so good in my daughters room we are going to keep it."
1,Too bad you don't have minus stars!,"I don't suggest buying this fan if you need light in the room. It has three ""mini lights"" the truth is they it is very very hard to find the kind of light bulbs you HAVE to have. They are a horribly bad for any room light. I had to special order and pay almost $4. per bulb. I have the fan in my kitchen, over the table, there isn't enough lightto even read the newpaper! IF YOU'RE LOOKING...KEEP LOOKING, this is a bad buy for light."
4,Great Fab,"I really love this fan, but the lights that fit them are extremely hard to find. I have had the fan over a month now and still no lights."
2,a lot weird.,"this one is a little weird.no, a lot weird.i;d say, only get this if you have EVERY other recordboozoo made.it;s not the modern sound.there are a lot of reasons why.but see my other reviews..wle"
4,works well for the price,"It's pretty decent. It doesn't stay on the flash too well, however. I'll need to rig up something (with velcro, probably) to keep it on."
3,Limited Use,"When fitting this unit on a SB-600 Nikon flash, you get little benefit beyond the diffuser built in the flash unit. With Bounce flash it helps some, but does nothing when used directly towards subject. Limited overall added value."
3,Sawright,"It doesnt stay on very well. Good construction but it doesnt seem to help diffuse too much. The built in diffuser does just as good a job. A nice little accessory for someone who has to own everything, but most users could avoid it."
1,Disappointing,A true Barry Manilow fan will be totally disappointed and disgusted with this item. I wish I never ordered this.
4,You have to be crazy to enjoy this book,"I have started three companies and there are still many days that I find myself wondering if I am nuts to be an entrepreneur. This book is entertaining and reminds me that, yes I am certifiably nuts, like most other entrepreneurs. Very little ""how to"", but very easy to relate to for an experienced entrepreneur (for instance, the sections on the emotional roller-coaster ride of starting up or partnering, or the little Buddhist sayings that get you through the tough days). If you are about to start a your first business this is a good primer, but its sort of like reading books about being a parent before you have your first child - you really won`t appreciate most of it until much later on."
2,Painful and very negative,"I just want to be generous so I gave this two stars. I tried to like this but found that it is very negative. It's like it almost doesn't want you to put up a business. I just thought when you want to start a business, you should have considered the ramifications already."
5,Meet and greet,The only thing better than reading Barry's book is hearing him speak. Check out his web site for his tour schedule and go see him when you get the chance.
5,The first one is worth the double feature!,"I bought this for my father, because he wanted the black and white silent version with Lillian Gish. We watched it together. Lillian Gish is absolutely mesmerizing. She is so beautiful and the photography and editing is amazing (not to mention the acting). When it was over, I felt that I had really been touched by the story and kept thinking about her face (and haunting eyes) for days afterwards.I could have done without the second movie in this set. It is the remake of White Sister with Helen Hayes and Clark Gable. Somehow, in color, with sound, the power of the story was removed. The magic and tension was missing. I do recommend this set, the quality is good, and it certainly is a piece of cinematography history, but I think you will find, as I did, that the original (with Lillian Gish) is much more powerful and touching."
5,Magic Sword/Sword of Lancelot,These were movies I had seen as a child and was happy to find that I could purchase them online through amazon.com. I received them promptly and have enjoyed watching them am looking forward to sharing them with other relatives!
2,Another early 80's slasher,This is a standard stalk n'slash type film from the early 80's but what I liked about it is the fact that instead of having a female college student as per the course the main character is a young kid. Peter Billingsley is refreshing to watch as the boy who encounters a maniac while on holiday in Arizona. In one scene his overweight and continually hungry babysitter goes out for some ice cream not knowing that the killer is lurking nearby. Having a desert location made a nice change of scenery too.
5,works great,"before changing the flapper, pressing the flush was hard. Now, no effort to flush. Feels like a brand new toilet. Great improvement after changing"
5,Home repair,"I needed to repair my toilet and wanted to do it myself. I searched the Amazon listings until I could match the color and shape of my rotted flapper ball. The new ball arrived quickly. Within 5 minutes, I had made the repair and everything worked perfectly. I saved the $60 charge of a plumber and, even though I walk with a cane, I did it myself! Thanks, Amazon."
4,An able chronicle of one person's approach to Buddhist practice,"Sometimes the usefulness of a book is evident by the number of short but potent sentences that stay with me long after I've finished reading it. By this standard Larkin's book is a real jewel. I've been encouraged and sustained many times by remembering some of the simple, profound truths I found in this book, such as ""It's never a straight line (p. vii)."" ""At worst, we face a day of conscious spiritual practice (p. 140)."" ""The trick is to just keep going (p.182)."" It's a deeply personal account of the author's own journey, and although it drags a little in places it does a fine job of bridging the gap betwen American sensibilities and Buddhist precepts."
4,Good Book for someone who does not know much about Buddhism.,I am only half way through this book but I look forward to reading it every night. It is offering a non-invasive approach to incorporating spirituality into your life with a bit of humor.
1,Not much substance,"I really wnated to like this book--it has a great title, cover, premise... and I took it to read on my way to a meditation retreat. But I found it repetitive and overly simplistic--perhaps if this is the very first book one is reading about Buddhism or working on a spiritual path, it would be sufficient...otherwise take a look at books by Pema Chodron, Philip Kapleau, S. Suzuki."
2,there are much better books out there...,"I just didn't think this book had a lot of value to it.She is probably a nice woman and she's doing her best to follow her path.But she really doesn't have a lot to offer anyone on a Buddhist path.There was nothing ""wrong"" with the book, really, I just really didn't find it that inspiring or useful.Half way through I felt like I was wasting my time and in the end I confirmed that I had indeed pretty much wasted my time.That said, okay, there are a few worthwhile stories in it."
4,Robert A. Heinlein meets Raymond Chandler,"This novel is set in that science fictional rarity, a libertarian dystopia. Despite the grim setting, it's a lot of fun, combining all the elements of film noir-- a tough and beautiful damsel in distress, narration by a wisecracking private detective, and complex conspiracies-- with an effortless flow of sf invention: Infinite Pockets, copbots, werewolfing, Crittertown, and much more. The style may owe a lot to Chandler and Hammett, but the overall feel is reminiscent of early Heinlein or John Varley.This is a big departure from Will Shetterly's last novel, that evocative memoir-as-fantasy ""Dogland."" That one snuck up on you; this one grabs you by the shirt-front and won't let go until you've finished reading. It's witty, fast-paced, and reminded me of the thrill of discovery I felt a long time ago, when I was a teenager first discovering science fiction, reading about all those amazing things."
3,An okay read,"Chimera was a very exciting book that dealt with a lot of interesting ideas and concepts concerning artificial intelligence and genetic manipulation. The problem with the book though, is that there is too many concepts that the reader has to grasp. There seems to be so many things occuring at one time in this book (a mere 288 pages) that it is hard to follow the plot. On the other hand, Zoe was a very real to life character and it was easy to identify with her problems. If you are into Shetterly, read this book. If you are not, you may wan't to pass it by."
5,Double Pleasure,I love this band and I love this album. A friend recommended them to me a few years ago and I checked out a couple of their live shows via archive.org and I immediately downloaded. Some time passed before I realized I need to hear how they sound in the studio as well as what other songs of theirs I need to hear.One way I have of evaluating a new acquisition is whether of not I'll listen to it over again before removing from the player and moving on to something else. The next level is how long I will keep in rotation before finding its place in my library of music. This album has passed both with the proverbial flying colors. It'll be some time before I file it.The guest steel guitar player gives it a real nice country feel
3,Review from Bra Abe GP in South Africa,"Positive points about DVD are that the songs and music are of an excellent quality. The entire show in its right, is fabulous. TP and his compliment of musicians, are exceptional. Despite all this, what I found to be negative and very annoying especially after the ""high-rating"" of quality that is given to products from USA and Europe, is that the DVD does not cater for ""full-screen"" viewing. Also, when I select the 5.1 ch audio option, the sound from the speaker is not in synch with what is actually being viewed on the screen. The sound is a few seconds ahead of TP and the other musicians. The TP DVD is my 12th buy of music DVD and all other 11 DVD I have, do not have such defects despite being manufactured/pressed here in South Africa. Therefore I am Proudly South African."
1,PAPER IS NOT WORTH THE PAPER IT'S PRINTED ON.,"IF YOU THINK OLD DRAG QUEENS ARE COOL AND BUY CLOTHING MADE BY SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF RICH PARENTS WHO CAN'T DESIGN THEIR WAY OUT OF PAPER BAG, BUT HAVE DECIDED TO CALL THEMSELVES DESIGNERS ANYWAY AFTER THE FUN OF CALLING THEMSELVES ARTISTS, OR ACTORS, OR WRITERS HAS WORN OF THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU.THIS IS A MAGAZINE THAT BRAGS ABOUT HAVING ""ANN MAGNUSON"" ON THEIR COVERS MORE THAN ONCE...WHO IS ""ANN MAGNUSON"" YOU SAY?...MY POINT EXACTLY.WHAT A BUNCH OF SELF GRATIFYING WANNABEES.THANKGODTHEERAOFTHESEPURVEYORSOFPOOPISJUSTABOUTUP.I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER MAGAZINE THAT WILL BE LESS MISSED.BYE LOSERS."
1,Fishbone??,"I'm glad Norwood, Angelo and Walter are still playing live shows. They are fun to watch and are truly talented. Unfortunately, without the rest of the original line-up, they don't really compare to the Fishbone I once knew and loved. It's sad that they are playing at heavy metal dives nowadays but go check them out if you want to have fun. Or just buy their first four albums and listen to them at home."
2,"Sorry, Pateman's prose is horrible","Written in difficult prose, Pateman's message appears to give the impression that women are the victims of the original political theorists. However, I must say one thing: Why is this book still noteworthy? I've met Pateman on many occasions, and I think it's important to know about her other (strange) political views. For instance, she believes in the ""minimum income,"" which means that someone will be paid regardless of whether they work or not (that's a great incentive to work--not!); she also appears to believe that women are suffering incredible discrimination in today's workplace, which does not appear to be true. I'm not sure why she's considered such a great theorist. Great theorists, in my views, revolutionize how we think about society and promote productive policies that create economic growth, prosperity, optimism. That is not the case here. Sorry!"
5,Simply the Best Catering Book on the Market!,"I have been in the business for over 15 years and have not seen a better written book for caterers. Do you want to learn how to sell, market and run a profitable catering company? Then this is the book for you. I have added ($) to my bottom line this year and I just got the book in March 2001! If your a caterer or thinking of becoming one.......THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE!"
5,Love them.,We bought these for our kitchen window. They are a perfect fit for the outdoor Alaskan look we were trying to have...
3,"Good, well balanced coverage of the region","This book proved helpful on my recent biycle tour of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. It's one of Lonely Planet's better guidebooks, however some sights suffer from rushed research. For example, the fort at Gingee--one of India's best--has three sections, but the authors failed to mention the most spectacular of the three. The authors should have mentioned Suchindram Temple, just north of Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu; the beautiful stone temple is famous for its musical columns and 6-meter-tall statue of the monkey god Hanuman. I found the book weak on off-the-beaten-path destinations. I would have liked more information on culture--places to visit and background; if this is your main interest, I recommend that you also check out the Rough Guide edition on South India."
4,Wouldn't go to South India without it,"In a couple of days, I'm again off to Bangalore and a month wandering South India. I'm assembling my stuff which includes the latest version of Lonely Planet's guide to South India. Could I get along without it? Sure, I'm experienced enough, but why make life and travel more difficult than necessary?There will be late arrivals to places I've never been but a room will be waiting at price and condition okay with me because a telephone number in the Lonely Planet guidebook worked and the review was close enough for my needs."
4,Angel Falls,The most varity in one country from huge snake hunts and alligators and paranas to beautuiful Angel Falls at the end.
5,Great introduction,"I'm a beginning student of Kabbalah but I, and the class using this book with me, are finding this to be a clear and well presented introduction and overview. Would recommend highly to others in a similar situation."
5,Love Conquers All,"I'm not much of a reader but a dear friend recommended this book. He said that Chapman is an amazing talent, and that we are fortunate to be alive at a time when such books are being written. I was skeptical but I have to admit that within 10 pages I was won over. This is a book about love - love that truly springs eternal, love that truly does conquer all. there is a reason that people write so many songs about love. I like the way the book deals with death. I lost my wife last year, and had I read this book before that happened, I might have embarked on a similar journey.. a farewell tour for my belove anna. I also read a review on this site that mentioned the movie weekend at bernie's. I love that movie but I think that review was very negative and mean-spirited, perhaps written by one who can not love."
1,NECRONASTYNESS,"I guess a book about people who refuse to bury their dead beloved and instead take them (the corpses) on a cross-country roadtrip isn't necessarily terrible but this one is.I am surprised the writer, Clay Chapman, could talk a (quasi-)legitimate publisher into putting out what is really a middle-brow defense of necrophilia, not a novel. At any rate it fails on both levels."
5,Miss Corpus,"Chapman is unafraid to delve into the human psyche after the moment of trauma. His beautiful and haunting writing proves that the human brain just might be the most delicate organ we have. Chapman's first novel is absolutely 2 thumbs up. Filled with tremendous irony and humor, his mastery and understanding of our language brings to life what is is to be human. A definite must read."
2,WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S: THE BOOK.,"I often imagine the producers of the beloved Weekend At Bernie's [or WAB] films pacing madly in some plush Tribeca office. ""How can we move forward with these beloved films while retaining our reputation for wit and originality?"" they'd ask.Luckily Miss Corpus has been written. Now it's not quite at the WAB level. The jokes too often fall flat, the situations strain credulity and the characters never amount to more than cardboard but in the right screenwriter's hands and with the benefit of Andrew McCarthy and Johnathan Silverman [not to mention the guy who plays Bernie!] to breathe life into the characters, Miss Corpus could be the most chilling installment of the WAB franchise, marking a turn toward true black comedy and reinvigorating the careers of some top notch actors. I understand the writer works by day for Bacardi and I think that this is the Bacardi of writing. Which is a good thing."
1,It all adds up...,"1 unbelievable premise+ 4 gratuitously gross subplots+ unlimited, pretentious wordplay+ 3 stereotypical narrators_______________________________an overblown, tedious example of overkill,destined for the remainder binSouthern Gothic? Flannery O'Connor must be rolling in her grave.**not that I want to give the author any ideas for the next book"
4,Road trip,"A stunning book that reads like the semi-conscious haze one enters after a long, long haul on the road. I've only gotten through half of the book so far, and I think it's brilliant. Will Colby's tale flits back and forth from memories to present day, much like the busy flies that amass in the coolers in his back seat. The addition of snips from the radio.. traffic reports, weather, advertisements, etc., add a soundtrack to the tale of madness. The scene where Colby plays baseball with the corncob armed boy is weird. The writing is great; it's easy to picture what is happening, but also how it feels. I can feel the gritty, hot day, the whisking of a car as it speeds through. The vulnerability of the apple that Colby pitches to the cob boy. The red clay haze of the afternoon. It's all there. I appreciate Chapman's talent and thank him for sharing his work with us."
5,joy ride through the little shop of horrors,"Incredible. That is the first word that came to my mind when I finished this book. I spent every spare moment I had engrossed in the words on its pages. It's twisted metaphors and similes make so much sense, but at the same time don't make any sense. Only someone with as much talent as Chapman's can make the comparison of roadkill and flowers completely click.I am an avid book reader. I have read every genre of literature out there. But I must say that Chapman has created his own genre...he has broken down a barrier that will never exist again, as long as he is writing. I often have 'vocal' reactions or facial reactions to books that I read, but nothing more than the standard ""No way"" or ""Oh my god."" But I'd read this book in front of my friends, and they'd have to check to make sure I was okay. I would go from expressions of horror to suprise to curiosity to empathy all in one page. It is truly an amazing ride...a definite must read!!!"

Flannery O'Connor must be rolling in her grave. (not that I want to read a book about it)"
1,DONT BUY JUST RENT,just let me say that rouge ops is no halo the plot typical graphics not worthy of the xbox the ai are idiots you could be right next to them and they would not even see you are you could be and the perfect hideing spot and your caught if you buy this game be pepared to die many deaths or get a game over because if you do one little thing wrong you will have to start over and the combat system sucks you repeat the three same moves over and over and over again everything about this game is a let down dont buy it
1,nowhere near splinter cell,"If you loved splinter cell like I did, you may feel tempted to get this game. It promises interesting stealth gameplay, yet it hardly delivers. First off, the gameplay control is very frustrating. Nikki walks around as if she were drunk; try to simply walk forward and she'll veere left and right. Also, there is practically zero freedom to do anything on the fly. Sure you can grapple and hang from ledges, but only when the ""magic cursor"" allows you to. Here's another example: you have a bomb with which to destroy a car; but you can't just put it anywhere on the car, oh no, it has to be near the little blinking ""bomb goes here"" light / prompt. This takes away from the feeling of freedom and relegates it to more of a game on rails feel. Secondly, the graphics are pretty lame by x box standards. Definitely rent this game first if you have any interest in it. Or hold off completely until Pandora Tomorrow is out..."
5,King-Smith has done it again!,"This book is soooooooooooo great! Dick King-Smith is my fave author. In this book Mr. Ape meets a family of gypsies and uses his giant house to keep many animals. When his house catches on fire everything he owns, his pets included, are in great danger. What will happen??? Read this book to find out the rest of this story. Karen"
3,Song Titles,"This 3 CD set of Jay and The Americans has tweeked my interest but before I'd even consider buying it, I'd like to know all the song titles and if the songs are originals or covers. Also, could each of the songs be available for a 30 second listen?"
2,Not as described on the website,"Where's the overlay? There was no opaque overlay to hold notes as described by Amazon. Unfortunately, I wanted to have this feature."
4,Good CD,"I bought this CD for my daughter - 4 months old and she loves the beats and I love listening to it as well. However, be aware that some of the words to the music are a little strange and some parents might worry if you child is old enough to understand what is being said. But this is a great CD if you are tired of listening to rock-a-bye baby all day long!"
3,OK album -- kid on cover the best part.,"This is a nice record. Nothing brilliant, but nothing awful either. I have to say, though, the cover is just plain swell and the kid pictured has a future in acting. He's all attitude at a very early age."
4,fun and unique album for toddlers and their adults,"This is a fun album. The music is a mix of well-known and new songs sung energetically and with the emphasis on making them fun. The first track, Rosie Flores' Red, Red Robin is terrific, and many others -- Hinky Dinky Dee, Camptown races, On Top of Spaghetti -- will have you cheerfully singing along and teaching your kids the words....Listening to the samples will give you a good idea of the album's style."
4,Great CD,"We really enjoy this CD, as does our 3-year-old daughter. Classics like ""On Top of Spaghetti"" are mixed with new songs like ""Don't Wipe Your Face On Your Shirt,"" a particular favorite of mine. In my opinion, Robbie Fulks' song ""Godfrey"" does work on more than one level -- nothing I think a kid would ever, ever get, but the lyrics did cause me to raise an eyebrow slightly (I mean, this is Robbie Fulks we're talking about... he's got a pretty edgy sense of humor, and let me be clear that I know this because I own several of his discs). I probably wouldn't give this CD as a gift unless I knew the parents well and felt confident they wouldn't have a negative reaction to ""Godfrey"" in particular.That said, this is a highly entertaining compilation, and one of the better kids' CDs I've come across."
4,Simple toy but high quality.,I bought this as a gift for my nephew who loves sea creatures. I still think it is high priced for a single rubbery toy but it is durable and was just what he wanted.
4,Item Very Small,"The product is nice, but small. I was hoping for a larger one. The measurements are described, but, my mind invisioned larger."
1,Bulldog 2030 is junk!,"Installed my bulldog 2030! It's is a total piece of junk.It only works when you tap on the hood. You can pound on the back of the car and nothing. Put the sensor at max, still nothing! This is more of a novelty not an alarm.Its a freaking joke! Don't waste your money!"
2,get what you pay 4,It works fine sometimes...other times it just goes off any time of day or not for no apperent reason.
2,Christmas muzak ...,"With Boney M.'s big selling Christmas album from 1981, producer Frank Farian recorded six new Christmas songs with Liz Mitchell and Reggie Tsiboe (who'd replaced dancer Bobby Farrell in 1982) in the summer of 1984; they were, however, only released at the time on a South African LP, but when Boney M. had split up in 1986, Farian wanted to keep the kettle boiling and dug out these disappointingly mediocre recordings, remixed the whole 1981 album but two songs, and released the whole mess in November 1986. And the result is awful! In 1992, this album was re-issued, and apart from ""Mary's Boy Child"" being treated with an unoriginal remix, ""Silent Night"" is also featured with a previously unreleased verse; this is also the only reason that this CD would be worth getting (if you're a fan like I am). I can strongly recommand you to get the original ""Christmas Album"" instead (it is available on CD) when you want to get in a Christmas mood, this CD sounds as supermarket muzak."
1,Makes my head spin,"I am very interested in reading about the Charlotte Mason method for supplementing at home with my preschoolers. I fortunately checked this book out at the library because had there been any reviews on this I might not have bothered.The book has a Christian slant to it which is fine, I understand that the subject was a deeply devout person, though it was a little heavy for me not being raised in that environment. But what really made my head spin was the authors use of exclamation points. Every other sentence has an exclamation point. I feel like Elaine's boss from a Seinfeld episode regarding her report and her ""inordinate number of exclamation points."" The author was clearly excited about homeschooling her family with this particular philosophy. I also did not like that the book was not ""polished"" it was more like the author's notes of her thoughts in a binder.I will not be able to finish this book and I am hoping the other one that I checked out is better."
1,Jesus,I really don't think that jesus was either conservative or liberal i think he was more focused on saving humanity from sin.But that is just my opinion.
1,Like heck he was!,"When I get mad, boy you better steer clear. I actually saw some knucklehead with this sticker on his car, and I was sure to give him the finger. Of all the wrongheaded claims ever made, this one takes the cake. Jesus, son of God, was most definitely a conservative Republican."
3,A disappointment,At the outset let me say that I am a great fan of James Booker and wish he had left more recorded material for us to enjoy. It is therefore really disappointing when the talent is overshadowed by the poor quality piano Booker was given for this (and other) series. They must have thought he was a honky tonk player. The left hand of the piano is almost non existent. Just compare the sound here with that on the 'New Orleans Piano Wizard: Live!' Tracks such as Minute Waltz and Gitanarias which showcase his chops and classical background sound amateurish. That he can make a bad piano sound as good as he does is a reflection of the man's genius.
5,very very good,"This is a live club recording of the great James Booker.The first thing to say about this is that the sound quality is varied and its not a top notch Piano either. These recordings weren't supposed to come out at all.Booker is erratic, and evidence of this can be found in ""All By Myself"" which they have had to edit because he probably stopped mid song, being distracted by something or someone. That said ""All By Myself"" is my favourite track, its a barnstorming performance capturing everything thats great about James Booker.If you have any interest in New Orleans Piano players, this CD and its sister (Spiders...) are essential purchases. This is what Booker was like when he was just left to play on his own without the constraints of a Band. Nearly all of it is worth having, and quite a lot of it is utterly brilliant."
5,Miracle at the Maple Leaf,A night in the life of a certified genius (touched with a healthy dose of insanity).
2,its ok,This cd does not have the orginal artist and thus the quality is poor but this does have the great love songs and is a good bargin at 5 dollars so if you need to listen to love songs at a great price purchase this cd
3,headphone cable slips out sometimes,"These are mostly good for keeping track of your headphone cable. However the silicone around the holes area is soft and so the cables slip out sometimes, especially if it gets caught on your arm or clothing."
2,needs improvement,"It's a good idea, however the rubber is too soft and the cords don't stay in the notches. I have to wrap the whole bundle with a rubber band and now it looks bulky, well, because it is bulky."
2,Probably the worst Science Fiction I have ever watched,"Fooled by a few positive recommendations from friends and a few good reviews on Amazon I decided to give this series a shot. With the exception of the episode introductions which are decent, even fun there is absolutely nothing redeemable in this show.I have watched bad Science Fiction in my time the last three seasons of X-Files leap to mind; its not that the series is bad because there are some good parts but the production values suck. You ever walked over broken glass? Like that.I've seen better special effects in a movie in an MST 3000 showcase. This spoiled the first three episodes for me and I did not continue. I do not recommend this series to anyone."
1,Starhunter - The Complete Series,"Very much a ""C"" or ""D"" series - not as good as I had hoped it to be"
4,Love these cheesy scifi series,"Being a sci fi nerd or fan, this is another of those series that you need to watch and have with your sets. In a way, all of these old shows tie together, which is odd but cool."
1,Worst show ever made,"I love sci-fi, and without a doubt, this is the worse show ever made. I got the series for Christmas and I tried to watch it, I made through the 1st show, barely and within 5 minutes of the second one, I stopped it. You know how you keep watching and hoping it will get better......well it doesn't. Save your money. I'm not sure what to do with mine, I feel like I'd have to pay someone to take it. LOL!!"
4,Older TV show.....,I had hoped this to be a little more realistic futureistic but it lacks something. I am not able to put my finger on exactly what.
3,Yawn Series,"This series is okay and worth watching, but the lead actor Michael Pare comes across as yawn and poor little me. It is the rest of the cast that makes it salvagable. Have not watched the Starhunter 2300 sequal series yet."
3,Surpassed by Starhunter 2300,"This is the original series that spawned Starhunter 2300. The production values are nowhere close to Starhunter 2300 and the special effects are necessarily far short of the subsequent series. However, the stories are reasonably well scripted and the characters interesting. It's not up to the standards of ""Farscape"" but it does have its moments.There is a huge discontinuity between Starhunter and Starhunter 2300 and there is little done to explain the breaks in the storyline. But it's still superior to most ""made for tv"" films that you say on *ahem* tv stations dedicated to sci-fi.Don't expect too much, enjoy the quirky characters and you'll be ready for a better experience with Starhunter 2300.The disks have zero ""extras"" and no interviews with the cast or production crew. Which is a shame because anyone buying this set is probably a fan and would've appreciated the extra effort. The studios are getting lazy."
2,You have to be kidding,I can't believe that this show ran 2 seasons and Odyssey 5 was cancelled after only one season. Starhunter has the worst stories and worst acting I have seen in years. The niece is always doing the wrong thing because she thinks with her genitalia. Sorry I had to clean that up. I couldn't even finish the first disc. Nice that I paid only $11 for it.
2,Great condition but the show itself was not great,show was very disappointing couldn't get past episode 2 before i couldn't stand the bad acting amazon delivery great as usual on time and in great condition!
1,Horrible,"I really can't figure out how this program lasted even one season. I am a Sci Fi fan but this is absolutely the worst thing I have ever seen. Put your money into a set of Firefly, Space Above & Beyond, Andromeda etc. I think I am going to donate this thing to the local Library so other people won't have to buy this thing to see how bad it is."
1,Can't rate anything that you don't get,I I would have gotten someting then I could have put up a rating. It was cancled by the shipper.
3,There are other Sci-Fy shows which are better,"I did watch through the whole series, once you get started you feel you need to finish it. It was OK, not very good or great. Below Firefly and Farscape by a long ways and no where close to Battlestar Galactica. Would I ever watch this again, probably not since I have so many other sets I still have not watched once. And then with so many other shows available on Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus . . ."
1,not what I remember,"I enjoy the old sci fi movies as one needs to use their imagination. This one is not any good an dont remember it being this bad. but being so long ago that I have watched it , its photo may have looked familiar an mixed it up with another one. Others may enjoy it but alas not me."
1,Awful Show,This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. I am a huge sci fi fan and this caught my eye at the local used book store. I was hoping for something reminiscent of Firefly but was seriously disappointed. I couldn't even get through the first episode the acting and story line were so awful. I know sci fi can be a little cheesy sometimes but this was way beyond that. Luckily I was able to get my money back.
1,"I'm a bounty hunter, it's just something that I do","""I'm a bounty hunter, it's just something that I do,"" who wrote that? The writing is bad, the plot is stupid, the acting is bad. The special effects aren't too bad.... Just trying to think of something positive... I'm on the third disk. Okay, I love Sci-Fi and will tolerate all sort of silly stuff to escape reality. I'm trying to get through this series since I paid for the DVDs. It's got to be the hardest series I've ever had to watch and I've watch a lot. Thank God that this series was canceled so that I don't have to watch it much longer. Then I will try to give it away, they may try to burn it though to keep others from this misery."
1,Beware Pan and Scan,"This show was filmed in widescreen but has been cropped for DVD. If you search for this product by title, you can get find it on Region 2 from Germany. Granted, you have to buy two sets to get both seasons, which individually are more expensive than this set that collects the show in its entirety, and they require a non- or multi-region player. But it's probably only fair to judge the series as it was intended.The show itself is very cheesy. I guess if you can watch something like Sliders, you can watch this. Depends on your tolerance level. Not a complex, imaginative or original show. But if you just need a sci-fi fix, you might enjoy it."
3,A bold experiment.,"Starhunter was someone's attempt to create a completely new scifi series, it failed, but it was a very good try. The stories tended to be a tad dry sometimes and the acting wasn't the best. Effects were cheap and the settings tended to all look the same.But, if you used your imagination and focused on the story ideas, it was a very entertaining show. You have mankind spread out across the solar sytem, earth is in ruins and the various planets and moons have their own soveriegn goverments. The only real law capable of moving back and forth are freelance bounty hunters and our three heroes are a bounty hunting team, working for some guy who you see give a narration at the beginning of each episode.The show tended to be more cerebral then the average scifi fan might like, but it was a good first try. If you're a die hrad fan who is always looking for the new and unusual, like I am, you'll enjoy it."
2,"Firefly, it ain't","I bought this set based on the reviews I read here, but for once, that led me astray. Michael Pare delivers every line in a monotone, every scene's shot in the dark, the plot is murky and slow, there's no chemistry among the cast... It's just plain bad."
1,Disappointment,"I'm a sci-fi fan and when amazon showed me this title among the recommendations I thought, well could be a nice series.I'm very ""easy"" to please when it comes to sci-fi, probably because lateley there is not so much of it. The DVD cover looked good.Sadly the episodes did not! I've just seen 7 episodes of it, don't think I will watch the rest of it. The acting is bad, stories are bad and the special effects aren't great either.Even Michael Pare's acting is a disappointment just as the rest of the cast with the exeption maybe of Murray Melvin.All and all a disappointment, I know, it is a risk to buy a series which you did not see yet and this time it was a bad choice."
3,Naples & Amalfi Coast Pocket Guide,"This book is very small, but contains some solid information about the area and the sites. If your looking for a book that is going to give you places to stay, eat and hang out then this is not the book for you."
2,Staccato badinage en masse turned me off...,"Overwritten, the story gets lost in the irritating machine gunjokey-ness that passes as ""wit."" Don't they edit theseso-called ""best-selling"" writers? I really wanted to get intoa juicy story...stuck it out for a few chapters...but was utterly defeated by the neverending ""shtick."" Sometimes it works.Here it does not. The author is carried away with her""style,"" which is, basically, just a smartass stand-uproutine which, unfortunately, does not stand up. Yawn."
3,Long Time No Good,"In this sequel to ""Compromising Positions,"" Judith Singer is once more looking into a murder in her small suburban Long Island town. Around page 200 she complains frustratedly that she's spinning her wheels, that the case is going nowhere. I could relate. ""When is something going to happen, here?"" I was thinking. Finally Judith comes across some information that turns things around, and from then on the book flies by fairly quickly. (With a great jolt of a twist on page 298!) But, honestly, the first 200 pages are trying, especially when you realize (I hope I'm not giving away too much here) that they have NOTHING to do with the outcome of the mystery. Still, the 3 stars are for Isaacs deft writing, her wry one-liners. I won't say ""Long Time No See"" is a waste of time, but if there's a Number Three, I won't be buying the hard cover. That's what libraries are for, you know?"
3,Needs a Bit More Ooomph,"Long Time No See is a witty murder mystery narrated by Judith Singer, who we first met in Compromising Positions. I read that one ages ago, and I remember liking it a bit more than Long Time No See. LTNS, while funny, has a bit of a pacing problem. It starts off fairly well, but then, as soon as Judith gets involved in solving the murder mystery, the story drags. She interviews what seemed to be countless people who could tell her nothing. And then, in a whirlwind, the story is wrapped up. Not bad, just not great either."
2,"Slow, Slower and Slowest!","This tale never really takes off. If you're looking for something to help you sleep at night, this book is it! I kept waiting for it to get better because I have enjoyed Ms.Isaacs previous works, but this one left me snoozing. Can't believe all these ""friends and acquaintances"" of the deceased would agree to meet and entertain in their homes a complete stranger who is interested in who murdered rich, little, perfect Courtney Logan. The storyline is as inane as the characters. Better luck next time, Susan."
1,"Book OK, audio edition terrible","This is the first Susan Isaacs book I have read. I listened to the abridged audio CD version of the book. Ms. Isaacs is the narrator herself. It is terrible. I am unable to concentrate on the story - I am so distracted by her voice. She tries to do ""accents"" of some of the characters - all the accents turn out to be caricatures - of southern accents, of Eastern European, of Brooklyn, etc. It is almost unlistenable. Do yourself a favor, Ms. Isaacs - save the narration for the professionals!"
1,"Boring, annoying and trying to make it to the end!","I always want to finish reading a book once I start but I don't know if I can make it with this one - there is just one idiot comment after another that is supposed to be funny. Maybe you are supposed to be over the age of 50 to get the humor. The story line is slow and just goes downhill as I continue to read. I am 3/4 of the way through and could really care less ""whodunnit""."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I found the story line to be sluggish and uncaptivating in the begining. When it did finally weave into a plot, it fizzled. Besides not caring for the plot, I found the many over zelous metaphores annoying. The book is a light read if that's what you are looking for, but nothing more."
3,Susan Isaacs has been one of my favorite authors for a long time.,I was disappointed in this book. I am not a big mystery fan and didn't realize this was a mystery novel until I started reading it. I didn't look at other reviews of the book because I have loved all of her other books. My mistake.
1,Don't believe everything you read....,"I have not read this book. However, I did have an interest in buying it, which is why I read the review from ""An Avid Reader.""It turns out that our avid reader has reviewed dozens of Kessinger Publishing books all with the same rating: 5 stars. How wonderful that these books are all uniformly excellent! This is one of the unfortunate downsides of public reviews - not all of them are legitimate.Buyer beware."
4,Regis likes to RANT!,"OK, I'm an all-out Who Wants To Be a Millionaire fan, so I expected to like this book. (Hey, don't expect to like a biography, and certainly not an autobiography, if you don't like the person it's about and you don't like their style.)Judging by the style of the writing, I believe this book was written by Regis sitting down with a tape recorder and telling stories. If you like his stories on Live! you'll like this book. He tells of travel frustrations, chainsaw envy, celebrity troubles, and Millionaire success. The style of the writing is just like his speaking style: ""I wanted a CHAINSAW! And no one took me SERIOUSLY!""The book includes plenty of comments from Joy and the two Philbin daughters, excerpts from the Live! show, David Letterman Top Ten lists, etc. This is no War and Peace, but it's a good, fun read. Here's hoping it will give me some subjects to bounce off of Regis when I make it to that Millionaire seat."
2,Who Want's to be Me?,"This book is fair. If you are a Regis follower and watch his LIVE show this book will be boring. He has told many of these stories on the air.I like Regis, but I wanted to read something different from what we hear on his daily show."
1,I mean...,"I heard this dude was arrogant and a diva. Then I remembered one show where the plugged this book from the hot seat on Millionaire. I mean, take a look at the cover of this book and tell me you don't believe this man thinks he's all that and a bag of chips. Of, course I've read the book front to back..."
4,Just the basics...,"If you're looking for information on how to frame a wall, and the basics of how a house is framed, this book will tell you that. There's sections on floor framing, sub floors, walls, and a bit about roof framing. If you need a book to help you frame a whole house, this may be a good place to start, but it leaves out a lot of the details necessary for framing a large job (floor and roof framing).If you just want to move/add/remove a couple of walls inside your home, put up some drywall and the like this is the book for you. It's clear, has good descriptions of the basic process, and and uses a step by step approach. There's even info on how to use some of the basic tools, and how to handle odd situations. There's even step by steps for things like doing demolition, using metal studs, and adding built-ins.In all I'd say it's good for a beginner, but not helpful for an experienced DIY type."
4,A very good start,"This starts the Dread Empire series simply, introducing the characters who will grow and change in the following books. It is enjoyable, but the rest are more so. Still, it is necessary to read it, to make sense of the whole."
3,no show,ordered this book 2 September and it's 18 October and I have no book yet! Read the black company and it was good. Looking forward to the dread empire and was disappointed in not recieving it.
4,Great Book for Career Bookshelf,"This text provides great general information about the various theories of ethics. It is a great text to keep on your bookshelf at work. In an organization that is beginning to develop an ethics program, it provides some insightful information."
4,Amazing Waffles,"The waffles are delicious...the taste and texture are far more superior than those cooked in a non-stick electric waffle maker. I am happy with the purchase. I rated it with 4 stars because the handles are too short, making turning the waffle a major challenge. Additionally, it took a few batches of trashed waffle mix to find the right time and temperature to cook the perfect waffle.... I tried a few of the tips and techniques found on this website...thanks to all who contributed."
2,can't get waffles to unstick,"I am a long time cast iron cook--it's all we use in our kitchen, and we use them every day. I love cast iron's nonstick properties, even heating, and ease of cleaning.That said, I cannot get this product to produce waffles that don't stick. I've seasoned it twice, made waffles about five times (maybe more), and it has yet to work for me. I end up with a mess that takes a good 15 minutes to pick burned waffles out of the waffle iron. I would return it if I could. I would love to find out if there is something I am doing incorrectly, as I really want it to work for me, but I'm running out of patience."
5,works with practice,This waffle maker makes big waffles. I am still learning to flip and get both sides of the waffle formed/ toated even. The waffles taste better than ones cooked on teflon. This item is small and easy to store and clean.
3,Not up to standaeds,Had forge residue on inside body of plate. Will have to be (hopefully this will do it) wire brushed to remove before use.
4,Mostly what I wanted,"Makes great, small waffles. Minus one star for Chinese build quality and manufacturing filth that must be scoured out before using as mentioned by other reviewers, and for the size being smaller than I would like (I would prefer 8"" instead of 6""). Sadly, you can't find an American made cast iron stove top waffle pan, so this is about your only choice for cast iron. Good price, though.As for reviews that claim waffles stick, you really must brush the iron with cooking oil on every use. Just get a small bristle brush and dish of oil. Stuff doesn't stick at all, then."
4,"BEWARE: Good for what it is, but not exactly what you expect","This is a pretty high quality piece of metal. If you season it correctly, and grease it before each use, you're going to be able to get waffles out without sticking, and once you get your cook time and temperature settings figured out, you'll get pretty consistent results.That said, this waffle iron wasn't what I expected so beware of the following:It's really small. It makes 6"" diameter waffles, not the 10 or so inch ones you're probably used to from your modern electric non-stick model.The waffles are really thin. The pockets of the device are shallow, and it's iron so its really heavy. Waffles are dense and thin, and often very crispy, so if you like the fluffy belgian kind, steer clear.Overall, this product works well for what it's designed to do, just make sure it's what you want before you buy it."
5,Well made piece,"Best option I've found for anyone trying to go simple (and teflon free!) with their waffles. Preheating and cooking is actually faster than with an electric iron, and it just takes a few tries to get a feel for heat and readiness. Compact and looks great. Do understand that you you have to season this, like any cast iron product, by coating in vegetable oil and backing for an hour or two before using for the first time (instructions for this are included)."
1,What a disappointment,I've bought a lot of goods from Amazon over the years and would have to rate this as one of the worst purchases I've made. The waffle iron is very small (only one waffle at a time) and the quality is poor. I had three different single waffles turn out disastrous (and I make waffles every weekend). Don't waste your money on this product.
1,Save your money.,There was a very thick wax coating that I could never get off. I tossed it without ever using. Save your money. It's not worth it.
2,Not your typical waffle,"Believe what these reviewers are telling you. These waffles are thin--not ""un doughy""--they're thin, like an Eggo. I got off the wax easily outside in my grill but I've had no luck seasoning the pan. I have seasoned this thing twice already, got a ton of smoke in my kitchen both times and still have issues with sticking, and I followed the manufacturer's instructions (first time) and reviewers' (second time). Maybe I'm expecting it to be like my Lodge products and I should just plan on having lots of waffles stick?Crispy fried waffles--if that's what you like and you can figure out how to season it, you'll love it. I love that it's Teflon free but I seem unable to use it. Why can't Lodge Logic sell this? This is the only Amazon product I've ever bought that I'm considering returning."
4,"holey eenny teeny, batman",order more than one if you plan to feed a famished family. from now on i'll pay closer attention to descriptions and measurements!
4,Works Great.. Wish the handles were a little longer.,"Once seasoned, this is absolutely a great waffle iron. Use it at home regularly and will add to the camping gear this summer.Took a little bit of practice to figure out how much batter to add and how long cook times were (less on the first side as it is on the heat cooking while you are adding the batter).Watch out for HOT handles!!!!"
2,Waffling in International Trade,"This iron produced very nice waffles. You do need to know how to heat the irons prior to baking the waffles. You might want to review what Mrs. Dull has to say in her classic ""Southern Cooking"" for tips on this--having followed her directions helped produce a perfect waffle the first time. My biggest problem with the product is that no where is the country of origin listed on the Amazon site and it is marketed by Rome, an American company, which has chosen to manufacture these things in China. If I'd known that I would not have bought it."
5,"Cast iron, does not mean ""Non-stick""","This is a GREAT waffle iron. It is true cast iron, this means it's not non-stick, you have to treat it before using it to get the non-stick behavior. You put grease or cook spray or oil, etc. on it and cook something unimportant until the waffle iron is BLACK. THEN it will be non-stick. This is how it is with all cast iron. It's a great product."
4,"Good, simple cookware","Once seasoned and properly pre-heated, produces good waffles. Note that its a little work to get the protective wax off when you first get it and that patience is required if you are making a large batch with only one iron. The iron has worked well for me so far. Proper use and care probably requires familiarizing oneself with caring for cast iron cookware (not a complex process)."
2,NOT GOOD FOR SMOOTHTOP ELECTRIC RANGES,"This product doesn't work well for smoothtops, because the handles are so low to the rangetop surface that you won't be able to grab them with oven mits on. And the handles, being cast iron, do get hot. I really wanted this to work, but after one try, it's too ungainly and too messy to bother with.Also, it's a complete pain in the @** to remove the paraffin coating and then cure the cast iron. You're going to smoke up your kitchen and create a long-lasting, acrid burnt smell. No idea why they couldn't just pre-cure it like the skillets you can buy at Williams Sonoma.It's probably fine for outdoor cooking or possibly on an indoor gas range.FYI, it's also made in China.Attention, manufacturers: There is a HUGE market out there for a cast-iron or enamel electric waffle iron that is free of teflon and of a decent size!"
2,not as expected,"received this as a gift and was looking forward to crisp waffles. i took off the wax in the oven-bad move-house still smells. then seasoned in oven-bad move-since that created more smell but not as bad. it is hard to use with a mitt but i heated it up on both parts-maybe not enough?-tried a waffle which steamed-not crisp and stuck even though i used plenty of pam. tried a second one with top off to prevent steaming but then put it on, flipped it & cooked more. it still stuck. it is too heavy for a camping tool unless no hiking is involved. would give it 1 star but will experiment more before that. buy a chef's choice 840b electric maker unless it is for car camping."
2,Rusted after first use :(,"I'm giving this product 2 stars because it functioned as advertised. But when I received it, it did not come with an instruction manual so I did not notice the wax until I was washing it before first use. Then after making really yummy waffles, I went to wash waffle iron and it rusted! I used it over a gas stove, was it the high flame? I saw pictures of folks cooking it over a fire. Well I'm pass my return and exchange window, so now my waffle iron has become a decorative piece. Mocking me everyday. Hey guys what can I do about the rust? I really want to use it again."
1,Might make good waffles if it didn't stick so bad,"In our family we know how to season cast iron stuff, but this NEVER got to the point where we were able to use it except to make waffle crumbles.The waffles stuck EVERY time. Even when we added a HUGE pat of butter before each waffle.We've tried a few different batter recipes thinking that might be the problem, but it isn't. This iron just isn't good.I might try to give it another shot sometime, but only if our other waffle iron (bought after we gave up on this one) breaks."
1,did not like this at all,"Arrival of product was better than expected, but kudo's from me end there. Product is very tiny, and seasoning per instructions and before use did not work for me. If it is so difficult to season- beyond what product advises- then it isn't worth buying, imo. Waffles stuck, even after three tries. Any company selling this should change instructions for seasoning and list limitations for use. I wasn't expecting it to be so small. I suppose if someone tries to break in my house, I can use it for defense. It's small enough not to be easily grabbed, and hard enough to knock someone out. But would I use it for making waffles? no. Even if it had worked, this is so tiny and handle is pretty short. It was a waste of money imo."
5,Great waffles for the price,"I ordered this waffle iron because I didn't want an electric one and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something I only crave occasionally. I seasoned the pan according to the mfg directions, heated on med heat for a few minutes, poured in the batter, flipped it over after about 4 minutes, cooked another 2-3 minutes, and voila! Perfect waffles! It also makes great cornbread waffles. I like it a lot and would recommend it to anyone without hesitation."
5,Great Product,This cd compliation has some good oldies on it. And it was in good condition I'm sure to order more.
4,An Elseworld Joy Ride,"I really enjoyed this Elseworld tale. What a great setting and great narration of story through one of the classic Superman supporting characters. The story was not as breathtaking as Superman: Red Son or Superman:War of the Worlds, but if you're looking for a good time in a medival setting I highly recommend checking it out."
5,don't understand why everybody doesn't have these.,"an excellent investment. had a pair of these that lasted for over five years before i finally had to replace them. excellent for people who carry their laptop daily or travel, as it provides surge protection without the bulky wall adapters. just plug it into the cord and forget about it."
5,Mini Surge Protector's,These are two great surge protectors that will travel on trips with me for my portable DVD player and laptop. They work good and are very small for travel.
3,I must have misunderstood,"Either I didn't read the description properly or I just misunderstood, but I thought this was two surge protectors for laptops. Turns out one is for a laptop and one is for an MP3 player or something similar. That's fine as I can use a surge protector for that, but I wanted two surge protectors for the two laptops we own.my mistake I'm sure, but if that's how you're reading it too, then this isn't what you're looking for."
1,Inconsistent quality,"I have bought 4 pairs of these (only needed 4 but they come in pairs). Two have worked for over a year, 2 failed within a month. Two connected well to cable-power supply; 2 had problems connecting properly. All computers are Toshiba. They have been used in same places and conditions. Hence, I assume failures are due to poor manufacturing and not to protection from a surge."
1,Garbage,"I used this for a couple months. Then one day, while using my laptop, I heard a popping noise. I unplugged my computer immediately. I picked up my adapter, with the connected surge protector, and didn't see anything wrong, but heard popping again. I unplugged the whole thing from the wall, and still heard a bit of popping/hissing noise. I then unplugged all the cords from each other. I smelled a terrible, burning smell. It wasn't my adapter. It was the surge protector. The smell was like burnt copper.It's a good thing that I was at my computer at the time this happened, or it could have been destroyed, or worse, something could have caught fire.I am now in need of a good, small, surge protector, but will be staying away from Targus products."
4,"Not bad, only a couple of small shortcomings","The item seems to work well, however the three pronged suppressor is a really tight fit when fitting it into the laptop cable's power converter (HP model). It needs to be pushed in fairly aggressively to make contact. Other than that, it seems to work great. It's nice not having to carry around a larger surge suppressor when traveling from one place to another.Regarding the two prong version, I don't know if I will have any use for this, but I'm holding onto it. It would have been better if Targus sold each suppressor separately, and sold each one for a few bucks less versus selling both for a higher price in the same package."
3,Good Solution for Laptops,I've always had good luck with Targus products and the price as of 02/05/2013 was great $5.86.Now it's $29.00 - WOW.We don't need the two prong adapters. I now have a drawer with about a dozen in there that may never get used. Isn't pretty much everything grounded today especially electronic devices.Cyberguys sells these devices separately the three pronged one (the one I want) for $15.79.I didn't mind buying both for $5.86 but the price increase makes it crazy to buy both.
4,Would Love to Hear Author Speak on Topic,"Millions of people have or will find themselves in the dangerous situations Louise Laurel describes: single-income families struggling to survive and get ahead, parents pressured to accept society's slipping values, anyone out of work with nowhere to go, children who are tempted by peers, and combinations of all these. Where many books might list ""steps to recovery"" in a more academic method, Louise Laurel shows by true examples how to overcome life's many obstacles.It must have taken a ton of courage to reveal Louise Laurel's (Daphne Clarke's) whole life to a world of strangers, but the people who read this book will be thankful the author chose to do it. As I finished the book, I kept thinking how wonderful it would be if the author would give talks to groups of people who might be facing the predicaments she discussed. From her writing style, it is obvious she would be an excellent public speaker."
2,Dont Watch,"Terrible, the movie is nothing but a political statement about how humans are destroying the planet. I couldn't eve ln finish the movie."
1,Anti-human Propaganda Film,"A disgusting abuse of decent animation to bash humans for destroying the planet. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a movie you should see. It is pure garbage, and is especially unfit for young children, whom I think it would scare to death. The animation could have been used in a way to convey the importance of being good stewards of the environment. Instead it is a very negative message."
1,This movie is ridiculous...,"We bought this movie thinking, for some reason, that it had something to do with the wonderful Madagascar movies. Don't be fooled by the ripped of cover design. Mankind is evil and will destroy the Earth unless the animals of the world stop them? It is full of extreme environmental propaganda from start to finish. We have separated the disc and paper sleeve from the plastic case and neatly placed each piece in our recycle bin for proper disposal."
3,Nice hooks.,"These are some nice hooks, however it was unclear what weight of line was snelled onto them until I got the package. Could have been more clear."
5,Hinsons,"I wore this project out when it first came out on record,,,LP... then no record player.. and now finally on CD,,, it doesnt get any better than this."
4,Bird Talk Review,"The Bird Talk CD was a very mellow, but had rather sad under tones to the background of the CD. The loons sounds were very clear and outstanding sounds, and broke out from the rest of the quietness of the CD. The loon sounds were almost distressing compared to the background sounds."
2,Owner,"The box was very dirty. When I assembled I found some minor scratches at several locations on the glass. Even the delivery person was amazed, how dirty the box was.I should have returned this unit, but unfortunately it is a large item and would have cost me a lot."
3,Ok Mirror,"The mirror itself is very nice looking and looks good in either the bedroom or the bathroom. The light, however, is not bright enough to be useful. It might make a decent night light. It operates on batteries or AC. The AC adapter is large and will cover another outlet, so another minus. Don't waste your money if you're buying it for a lighted makeup mirror."
1,This is worthless!!,"Bought this thinking it would at least be usable, but I have seen toy makeup mirrors that are better. I really don't understand how Revlon would think this was something that people would want. A Total waste of money for me."
3,If you want light it's no good,"The mirror itself looks good but the light is really poor. Yes, it's soft but it's soft as a candle-light. Can you imagine doing make up by candle-light? So, if you need just a mirror this one is not bad, but if you need a GOOD LIGHTED mirror choose another one."
2,It's OK for the price,"It's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror, I suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification. The light is not great at all. It's very dim. One of the good qualities of the mirror is that it's cordless and comes with an adapter if you don't have batteries handy."
1,Inadequate Lighting and Magnification,This mirror is unsatisfactory becasue the light is negligible and the magnification (5x) is not sufficient.
1,Revlon RV970 Lighted Magnifying Mirror,"This is a very lousy product; the lighting around the mirror is absolutely useless; when you turn the light on, it seems like you're still looking at the mirror with no light; awful product; eventhough it's cheap but it doesn't even worth a dime."
1,mirror,"It was not as good as I expected. I felt the quality of this item was cheap. Therefore, I returned it."
2,Light Is Useless,I took this mirror back. It was just useless as far as the lighting goes. I am better off putting my makeup on with bathroom or window light. Mirror is too small! I do not recommend.
2,Yuck!,"don't like it - the mirror is heavy and the magnification good, but that light!!! Or lack thereof! Won't do that again. Where do I return it?"
2,Disappointed,This bag is absolutely tiny. It has no room for anything. The description and 1st review lead me to believe that it has ample room. The segmented main compartment makes no sense. If you use it might be able to squeeze a battery charger on one side and a couple of digital tapes on the other. Don't waste your money. All this bag might offer you is a handle for your camera.
2,ok cd,this cd is a little cheesy but still good. kind of eighties synthesizer. There are better cd's out there but if you love the sounds of loons i think you would still enjoy it.
3,Twilight...,"Breaking Dawn Part 1 is probably the better of the Twilight movies. Although Bella's Wedding Edition is not really that exciting. I wish I realized that the only difference between the regular Blu-Ray and this, is the fabric poster... I assumed there would be extra interviews or bloopers but there wasn't. I'd say, if you'd like to own it, don't spend the extra money on this version."
1,Really????,"To start off, I already hate this Saga..But that is not the reason I gave it a 1 star. I bought this for my wife, who is a huge fan of the book series and subsequently of the movies as well. I had seen the same edition of this movie with the DVD package and it looked really pretty. So I bought this one thinking it would be a blu-ray case White wedding... To my disappointment(same feeling from my wife) it was just a box that was white containing just a regular blu-ray with a single disc and not even any relevant special features.... Well I wouldn't expect anything good from these guys since all of this is purely commercial ( I know almost everything has that commercial angle, but there are those who would at least try to give you your money's worth of goods, and not just get your money and run leaving with a hafl baked product).I'm sure there are better version of this movie but surely this ain't it... But my wife just was happy with the movie so she didn't really fuss."
1,Not a good purchase,I bought 2 of them and both leaks air. I was at Walmart and found the same snake for $5.47. You will end up sending them back.
2,Doesn't stay inflated for long!,"When I blew it up, it looked great. However, it deflated within a day. It's a pain to blow this thing up all the time."
1,Didn't work,"This was the latest in my never-ending effort to keep ducks away from my pool. It failed. I even tied it to the pool cleaner so that it would move around. The ducks ignored it. Like they ignored the owl decoys, swan decoys, alligator decoys, and the shiny tape."
2,Neat idea,"So we ordered 3 of these for the garden because we were having trouble with squirrels stealing tomatoes. We kept moving them around, but the squirrels got wise within a week and they are more decoration than a functional deterrant. One did have a little bit of trouble sealing the fill plug shut, but it's a decoy not a pool float and if it's not inflated to the point of popping its not an issue.Neat idea, just didn't work for us. No bird issues, but the squirrels kept taking tomatoes so early the birds didn't really have a chance. I was concerned they'd blow away but they stay put nicely due to the S-shape that they make (a snake-like squiggle)."
2,"Flat snake, anyone?!","I bought this snake to hopefully discourage the songbirds from hanging around our (fenced-in) front yard so our cats would have less chance of catching them!Anyway, don't bother, however inexpensive it is. It lasted like three days, if that, before it somehow got punctured - it IS meant to be placed outdoors, after all! Dumb. Also, while it's a good large size, the markings are very fake-looking. Next one I look for will NOT be an inflatable snake!"
3,NOT REALISTIC,"it doesn't look realistic at all, you can tell it's fake from a mile away :/ I'm kind of disappointed"
5,Works,"We use this in the garden over the tomato plants. The birds don't like it. They do tend to deflate, so we keep refilling them. You do need to place them early in the game. Don't wait till you have a lot of trouble. (One day had a bird above that loves our tomatoes. I picked up the snake to move it & didn't realize I was squeezing it, which made it move like a snake. The bird above started sending out danger-alert calls to the other birds. Found that was a good one. So I tend to do that when I re-inflate them.)"
1,snake that doesn't bite,The Giant 6ft snake we purchased has made for comments from family and friends but has done nothing for the birds that keep nesting in our trees at night messing on our deck. Worth the price for peoples curiosity but for what it was intended. Possibly it would work in a garden setting.
4,snake,Had a wood pecker outside my bedroom window. Bought this and he was gone the first day and never came back. left outdoors and found it to be of good quality and always inflated up no problems. Birds hate snakes.
3,Religions of the World,"When I purchased this I believed it was another book that I had seen which was quite outstanding. This had some interesting information, but was not what I thought it was and didn't impart the sort of detail I was looking for."
5,Great for kids age 9 and older!,"This was perfect for my 4th grader! It's a basic review of how our Government works and it's at their level. Also, it arrived quickly!"
2,Boring,"Bought this for my homeschooler, and although it is written ""okay,"" it is boring. We found better, easier to follow material online for free."
4,Review,The book is old (1960) but a good one. I lost my original copy in the 1994 Northridge CA earthquake and have finally replaced it. Good combination of analytic geometry and calculus.
4,Works just as it's supposed to,"The converter works just fine, just like it's supposed to. I've been using it with my laptop for the past two months of being in France and it hasn't given me any problems. Just remember, 2.5 pounds is quite heavy when you have to carry it around with you all the time."
2,Kind of bulky,"I purchased this for a recent trip to France and Spain. Due to luggage and weight limitations, I decided to travel light. This unit is quite bulky and on the heavy side, so I left it at home. Maybe I can use it on another trip to Europe."
2,Voltage Converter,"Product worked perfectly for 1 day. Second day, the product no longer worked and something was loose in it. Would not recommend. Defective product returned."
1,Bad choice,"Needed a small knob for cutting board.......Feel like a big knob for choosing this one, finish is not like my other satin nickel hardware? Pricey I thought, but could not find a small one like this localy. Bad choice. It's IN my drawer, not ON it!"
4,Tracks,"New Age sounds mixed with Nature Sounds. Different from the normal ""nature"" sounds.1. Deep Blue2. Beneath The Waves3. Watercolors4. Aquatic Poetry5. Moonlight6. Graceful Diver7. Dolphin Dreams8. Peaceful Mariner9. Poseidon's Realm10. Are Of The Dolphin"
4,aberdeen not aberdeen,"i'm going to be obvious about this: i am writing my own review. only to say that the other aberdeen albums listed with this title: ""SUBURBAN"" and ""ABERDEEN"" are not by the same aberdeen. if you are looking for other music by us, these are not it.sorry about the 4 stars. but it's better than putting 5 right?"
1,Strawberry Shortcake Tricycle,I have purchased this tricycle for my granddaughter twice--I have received a different tricycle each time. I really don't think that this company actually stocks this bike..............I am very frustrated that a large company cannot send the correct merchandise. I have been assured that I will be notifed when trike is available--I have not heard from any one since my last contact....Good luck if you think yor are getting this model of tricycle...............
2,an amateur,"This book describes good filtration systems, some may be considered as old, others too bulky, but what surprised me the most was to find in page 6 referring to nitrite as NO3 and nitrate NO2 (it is nitrite NO2 and nitrate NO3)! After that I took all information with care and check in other book for confirmation. How is it possible for the author to miss this? If you want to see nice photos, fine, but be ware some pages stick together and seem they are going to break, so be careful."
2,Needs more info.,"I wish now that I did not buy this book, the information is just too general. Basic design and filter sizing are topics that I expected to find in this book."
4,Great!,"Really like this little piece. It's not THE highest quality thing available, but it's lovely and will protect your memento. If you're sentimental and want something utterly romantic to remember your wedding with, this is definitely a good way to go!"
4,Reliable Restores - Run UNIX 'cuz NT is brain dead,No problems with the HP DAT drive on my UNIX system....
4,Youth and Mortality,"This episode is centered with unusually serious subject, the consideration of our mortality. Poignantly, Joseph Kearns, who played Mr Wilson, died just a week after this episode was aired on February 17, 1962. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage."
4,"What is that, I haven't a Clue to what that is?","I like this this Television Show "" Dennis The Menace, Season # 3. The one { 1 } thing that I Don't like to much is that they had Replaced Mr. Wilson with his brother { the Character, NOT in Real Life }, and there Wasn't anything explaining why he was Replaced, they just all of a sudden had Written Out the Original Mr. Wilson and in his place they had brought into the show his brother { in Character that is, NOT in Real Life }. Why didn't they say that he was leaving the show because of illness, going to be with a Dying Family Member, or a Very Good and Close Friend or something like that? At least that would make allot more sense then deciding to Drop him for the Remainder of the Season { if NOT for the Remainder of the Series }.But other then that, I really like the Show as well as the 3rd Season."
5,Great nostalgic tv series,"This show really captured the comic strip. The earlier episodes with Joseph Kearns were better than the later ones, but Jay North still carried the show and provided enough laughs to keep it interesting."
5,Excellent,This is an excellent meditation book for recovery from sex addiction.Highly recommended! Deals with most aspects of sex addiction......Awesome book.
1,Items backordered-not informed when ordered,16 items were ordered and only three were shipped. Not informed when ordering that only 3 were available. Would have ordered from another site if informed. Had to have the books for a conference on September 9 and original order said all would ship in 5 to 7 days. Very disappointed!!!
2,mmm,"I guess this dictionary is OK for elementary school students. The entries are too naive, almost childish. I felt that it was by far too unpractical, often not useful at all. They don't include significantly used slang or informal language. I you are a native spanish speaker (like me) planning to read a book in english and look for the words you don't understand, definitely don't buy this one."
4,Basic dictionary,"Excellent book for people working together that do not speak the same language but need to understand each other. Beware that Spanish varies by the geography of the region from which the person is from--Mexico, central America, Chile, and Argentina each have their own type or style of Spanish."
4,Hablo espanol un poco,"I dont speak much spanish but really found this book to be a helpful reference when I needed to find out a strange word. If you dont yet have a spanish-english dictionary this is the one I would recommend, except for higher level speakers."
2,..not the best,I am in my second semester of college spanish and find this dictionary very lacking! When I write my essays often la profesora will tell me I have selected the wrong word in translation. It only has a few pages of verb tenses so I have to go the verb book to find the tense (Barron's 501 Spanish verbs- which I highly recommend!) I am going to try the Barron's dictionary. I like that it comes with a download version so I don't always have to lug around the book.
4,if you want a challenge,OMG you have to be rocket scientist to figure out how to open and close the clasp on this watch. i bought for my husband and we had to go online to figure out how to secure the claspthe face is large but the watch is beautiful so it is worth it!
4,A Great Game That Simulates Owning Your Own Monster!!,"This was a great game that I enjoyed playing a lot. The point of the game is to raise a monster. You start with a low leveled monster, your goal is to make them learn different attacks and win money against other trainers in battles. This game is very similiar to Pokemon. The only thing I didn't like was after you raise a macho battle-ready monster that took hours to train, it dies. Anyway this game is a great game!!"
4,My Mochi ate my homework,"If you like to train and battle monsters, you will love this! You create, raise, train, battle, and love your monster. I had a c-level Gibberer (Ape\Hare) named Ogno, but it died. :("
4,An ironic conterversy,"An excellent game, but lacking a straight forward plot. Great variety and open-ended gameplay is what intrigued me. A certain improvement to me was that I now have an English version of MR2. I have basically all japanesse versions of games before they come out here but I finally have a MR game I can understand. Although this game is an improvement from the MR1, the gameplay doesn't quite differ much. I hope their next sequel is better..."
3,"Mocchi's not monotonous, but some things are.","The game all together is a good game, but there could have been so much more done with it. The only interaction you have with your monster is when it asks YOU to play games with it. Otherwise, you can only tell it how to fight, and you can't play with it. All you can do is give it things to do an watch it. interaction is limited to giving. You have to battle to get the money your monster needs for food, or you can sell them to get money. Also, many people get this confused. You can't get thousands of different monsters, you are limited to the 418 (I think) in the game that you can make, and you can't unlock all of them until you perform certain tasks. So, playing the game can get monotounous, but they have a good base, they just need to work on it. I give it 3 out of 5 stars."
3,If you like the feeling of finding something new?,"MR2 is great for people with patience and who are willing to go through hundreds of compact discs to find a rare or new monster to raise. But first you must go through adventures and battles within the game to release these rare monsters. A few upgrades from the first Monster Rancher, such as the drills and errantries. It gets really repetitive once you find all the secrets and goodies. Overall its a game to pass the time, if you have nothing else better to do."
4,Strange Game,"This game is strange indeed. But give it a chance, you will find it is very addicting. It's wierdness is very alluring. You may find you are repulsed by your own monster. Until he begins to enter tournaments, then something awakens within you. This game has a high replay value."
1,Did not work in our machine,"It was easy to buy this with Amazon Marketplace and the seller was great, but we have a playstation 2 and even though it is supposed to play all playstation 1 games it did not play this game. So we had no fun with it whatsoever and had to return it. It was easy to return and we got our money back. All I was out was the money it cost to ship it back."
1,I've been in car sales 2 months and this book bores me.,"I think I learned more in a weeks worth of ""go get 'em"" meetings in the morning than this book offered me. I'd kind of like to have the three days that it took to read this book back. I am new to the car business. I will say that I just finished and found very useful a book called ""Cars and People: How to Put the Two Together."" I've read a few others and they all seem to be like Mr Radosevichs book, simple, cookie-cutter. Sorry."
2,Pretty Good One,"This book and ""Automobile Sales Training and Tips From The Pros by Douglas Hensley and any books by Bob Cohen or Stucker should be packaged together. Between them one can learn a lot if you want to sell cars."
1,Reviews by S. Douglas Scotty and Hardluck Stink,"Why is S Douglas ""Scotty"" slamming every car sales book on Amazon but Zig Zigler's? Do you work for Ziggy or maybe a friend and pushing this book for him. Take a look at all of S. Douglas ""Scotty"" reviews concerning car sales. He puts almost everyone of them down but praises Zigler's book. What's up with that?And then if you look at reviews from HARDLUCK It makes one wonder if he is selling a competitor's book on here because he is attacking books written by Douglas Hensley who is a really good writer. It makes me wonder if (S. Douglas Scotty and Hardluck) are the same person or are possibly in cohoots together pushing people away from pretty good books. Something stinks here. I wish I had time to play on the web all day and put bogus reviews on people. Something stinks in Denmark!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,All hail the second coming of 80s alternative rock,"This is fantastic Joy Division influenced pop from NYC, moody with high emotional drama and some really good songs. A few years ago a band a sound steeped in 80s melodic postpunk would not have been taken seriously (e.g., Stretch Princess). But with the emergence of bands such as The Strokes, The White Stripes, The Hives, and The Mooney Suzuki, the grunge/indie/emo logjam has finally been shattered. I eagerly look forward to the full-length in August!"
5,Essential for any Interpol fan,"The ""Interpol EP"" was originally issued in June, 2002 as a ""preview' of their debut album ""Turn on the Bright Lights"". Even though 2 of the 3 tracks on the EP would wound up on the album, it nevertheless is an essential CD for any Interpol fan.""PDA"" is one of the best songs from the ""Bright Lights"" album. It comes with a hard-driven, yet mesmorising beat, and the last 2 min. ""outro"" is genius. ""NYC"" is the most inward looking song (don't call it a ballad!) from the album, and the one that would give the album its title. ""Specialist"" is the last track, and the one that makes this EP, er, ""special"". The song is completely in line with the dark atmosphere of the album, and similar in energy to tracks like ""PDA"" and ""Obstacle 1"". (It is also a staple on Interpol's current set list. If you have a chance to see them live, don't hesitate!) Buy all means, BUY IT!"
3,H-town holla,"Good cd, the new one is better and has better beats though. City of houston is a sweet ass song, its all about houston but the melody of Red Hot Chilli Peppers - Under the bridge, but more gangsta rap style. For all you lone star ridaz lovas, check out swishahouse, the are off the hook... holla"
3,Playing the percentages,"I bought this book after a recommendation taken from a 10 page WEB tutorial on creating 2D sprites and tiles for computer games. A couple of weeks later a pretty hefty book arrived on my doorstep. Unfortunately, the majority of the pages could have been thrown away.30% of the information is no longer valid especially in the first 5 chapters where DOS seems to have made a comeback.30% of the information seems to be either 'waffle' (another reviewer use the term 'filler' which is very accurate) or highly suspect.30% was very useful10% might become usefulMost of the utilities included on the CD are either old, rubbish,peculiar or can be downloaded anyway.I really wanted to like this book but I find myself going back to that 10 page WEB tutorial when actually creating any 2D graphics."
4,The Main Event,"Is the book worth it? Or is it not?Today's Main EventGood v.s BadFirst lets get on with the facts.It does teach about sprites, and small graphics. It does a awesome job in teaching with in thoses subject. If you are new to the game, I would say this book is for you. If not, don't waist your time. Will it help you make a 4.56 Million dollar game? Hell No! But it's a great start.Winner, of this bout by Pinfall - GOOD!"
1,incompatible,will not play on windows 7 - tried all kinds of ways to get it to run - not installing a jaguar emulator - boo!
1,Does not work for XBOX,Although advertised as a replacement power cord for the original XBox it does not work - cannot recommend it sorry
5,Good for people who are thinking of getting into telecommuting,"I was looking for a book on how to manage telecommuters, but this had a great checklist for when I interview someone thinking of telecommuting. Quite a few items taken from the book will come in handy."
5,Timeless,"I was hanging out in a Village coffee house one afternoon in 1962 when someone played the juke box and the voices of King Pleasure and Annie Ross stopped me in my tracks. Wow. I bought the album and decades later the CD. I consider the music (Pleasure's ""Red Top"" and Ross' ""Twisted"") classic. Ross' vocalizations (of almost 50 years ago) are still very fresh and innovative...even for today. Get this album!"
5,Blackaby's Devotional - Experiencing God,This devotional is a gem. I thought all devotionals were about the same. This one is invaluable for me. He hits the target every time. He chooses a scripture and expounds on it so eloquently and wisely. I am blessed each time I read it. I hate to start my day without it.
5,Great Devotional,The selections are really thought provoking. It is an excellent devotional. The only negative is that the print is sometimes hard to read for those with eye problems.
4,"Thought provoking, insightful","I am very glad I purchased this little devotional. Even though each devotional is very brief, they are always very thought provoking and challenge me in at least one area in which I need to be challenged. Each one is scripture based and not just an inspirational story from someone's life and I like that. My only problem with it is that the print is quite small and not as easy to read as I would like; however, I llike the compact size of the book so that is the trade-off."
5,Exceptional!,"What an awesome study. You can't help but strengthen your walk with God as you ""exprience"" what he is doing around and through you. He is always as work around you, desires a loving, intimate, personal relationship with you and invites you to participate in his work to bring about his plan for your and the world. All of this and more is outlined in this study and teaches you to hear God speak to you through his Word, holy spirit, prayer, circumstances, and the church. Highly recommend!"
5,Experiencing God- Daily devotional,I love this little book and use it daily in my personal devotions. It seems that each lesson has direct application to me and or events I encounter during my day. Praise the Lord!
3,Has no journaling space,"I had a copy of this that was a larger-sized book with journaling lines in the margins. While the book itself is absolutely phenomenal and changed my life, I really appreciated having the space to write in the book, but this one does not have that. I wish I would've known that before purchasing this copy for a friend."
1,waste of time,"Ordered one of these, would not charge. Returned it, reordered, would not charge. Do not waste your time and Amazon's. Amazon was great about the returns but the product is junk."
2,"Ummmm, ok","I don't remember buying this so the music must not have been that good. I love reggae and ska and calypso, so I don't know what went wrong here."
5,Evil Never Dies,"Usually I would complain about 'Another Live Album' but I've been a fan 'Killfan for years and I will take em anyway I can. And besides all of that, this album features songs that were not included on the previous live albums. In fact, if I'm not mistaken ... none of these songs were on the others. In a few months the full length show is going to be released on DVD. I can't wait to snag up that one as well. So, do yourself a favor.. pick this one up. You will not be dissapointed."
4,Good to get second hand,"I bought this CD for a particularly hard to find song: ""Love of My Life"" by the Winans. There are some other good tracks on there that make the song worth the purchase price ""Let's Get It On"" and ""You Are My Lady.""As compilation CDs go, this one is a bit above average. It's not worth more than the price of a used CD."
1,Beware! copy-protected CD!,"This CD is copy protected, and will not play on Apple's iTunes and many other players. Beware!I loved the Gurus and I love the ""Mr Tripped"" EP. This one won't even play on my equipment, however!"
4,Comprehensive and Useful,"This is a thorough book explaining the law school application process in detail. Includes checklists and timetables, as well as suggestions as to how to minimize the damage of grade fluctuations in a college record and the effect of medicre LSAT scores. It also provides strategies to employ in applying to law school for those of us without stellar LSATs and high grades. A section on a Texas case that laid bare the mysterious methods of law school admission committees was especially helpful. It is a little clipped in places and sometimes too glib, but is a good source of information."
3,"Somewhat informative, but nothing amazing.","Weaver's book may give insight into the law school application process, but it lacks as to what pre-law students must do to adequately prepare themselves for the experience. For example, while he mentions that students should major in a challenging field, he does nothing to offer reasons that go beyond the common sense that applicants must try to distinguish themselves from others. Further, this guide is somewhat outdated. His stance against web sites loses out when we realize that updates have been made to the LSDAS. I would recommend that students would do better to spend their money on a LSAT preparation book than to get information from ""Game Plan."""
2,"Lots of theory, little programming","This book has a good amount of info on how MTS works and some of the things to keep in mind when developing for MTS in C++. However, it has vary little programming! There are few applicable examples. This book has lots of theory with little practice. You will not learn how to develop C++ for MTS with this book, but you will understand how MTS works."
2,Another poorly written book from Grimes,"This badly written book goes into various details without explaining concepts. It does not talk about desgining transactional applications. It is random collection of thoughts on narrow issues. This style is typical of the author.This is definetly not in the class of ""Essential COM"" as some other reviews would have you believe.Note to Grimes: Please read books by Box, Petzold, RIchter, Scott Meyers,Lippman, Rockind to get an idea on how to communicate technical information."
2,Very diluted knowledge,"The author tries to span the universe in just one dance - the results are well known: the book is not an ultimate reference for developer. Nor it is a simple and concise reading. It contains too many silly screen shots with MTS Console of other GUI screen or table of MTS event codes - stuff for beginners. The book is really hard to read although it contains the knowledge. The downloadable code samples are disappoining. As a product it is somewhat raw/inmature (like all appservers themselves!). If Don Box's ""Essential COM"" is five stars, this one, with its current ambitious title is two or less."
1,Very hard to understand,After spending a few weeks reading this book I really can tell you that you should not buy this book. First of all nothing is in order and he tries to work thinking that you know everything. This book does not cover a lot on programming it is very bored the author doesn't know how to attract the reader.
3,Boyfriend's Hat,Hat ran small in size. Next time I would order one size up. It fits him a little on the snug side.
5,Fabulous! Get your Grumpy Voice out!,This is my favorite halloween story! The illustrations are hysterical! We play find the fork! The last picture of the book is a Hoot! You have to read this with you grumpy old man voice. It's simply fabulous!
5,MORE PUMPKIN PIE!,"After reading a review of this marvelous book in a parenting magazine, I looked for it at our local public library. All 3 of my kids absolutely LOVE this book. We have checked it out over 10 times so I thought I should just buy it. My kids are ages 7, 5 and 3 and it is one of our all time family favorite books hands down! It is so fun to read and the kids can't get enough. I hope Mr. Cazet writes a sequel!"
5,This book is so clever and so funny!,"My entire family loved ""The Perfect Pumkin Pie."" The ghost of Old Man Wilkerson comes back to haunt his old house in search of a perfect pie. Grandmother and Jack are the recipients of his ghostly and ghastly visit. It moves fast and the art is like the pie - ""perfect."" Anyone who doesn't think this book is hilarious is as dead as Old Man Wilkerson."
1,Don't be fooled by the cover...,"...because this is a regency compilation. For those of you who don't know, that means no sexual tension, no terribly complex characters, and generally no consummation, shall we say, of the relationship except maybe for a kiss at the end. I stopped reading regencies when I was sixteen, so I wasn't thrilled with this book.Like its predecessor, Lords of the Night, His Eternal Kiss doesn't deliver on the promise of dark, sensual power most of us associate with vampires. If you are expecting something along the lines of Anne Rice, Laurel Hamilton or Christine Feehan, you will be sorely disappointed.However, those of you who enjoy regencies may well like this book."
2,Not To My Taste,"I really hesitate knocking a group of stories because they don't contain what I hoped to read, but in this case I feel it is necessary and justified. A Vampire story that is listed as a romance should include both action and romance. Well the first is not very exciting and the second is completely non-existent - a kiss, a touch perhaps, but don't expect anything else in the way of love play. The stories were so boring that I skipped around till I found something interesting. They all had great potential and since they were linked even more could have been done with that theme. I was very disappointed and will not purchase any others in these series until I'm sure the content will satisfy what I expect to find in a vampire romance novel."
1,Not Impressed,"The pins don't hold in the least unless I am using them wrong, but how do you know when there aren't any directions?? The rollers are very hot and curls come out frizzy and crimped. Adds volume, but then again, what rollers don't? Not impressed. There must be better products on the market."
4,Great!!,I love the product it works great. My only problem is with the clips for the ceramic roller they don't always stay in place. But other then that it works great.
5,Great live performance,"This is one of the few ""live in concert"" recordings that really lives up to its name. Usually, the sound quality is extremely poor, or the artist gives short shrift to their old material, instead choosing to showcase whatever newer material they're promoting at the time. On this CD, the sound quality's very good, and Irma performs lots of her older songs that her fans love."
3,Huge disappointment.,"Lousy sound quality. Irma has strained her voice beyond recognition. Irma should give her voice a rest and recover her famous timbre. Musically Irma is wonderful, but she is going the way of Maria Callas."
3,A Good Start,"This video is pretty informative and good for people just starting out,but if you have been vegan it dosnt really give too much new advice, most of its common sense (ie dont eat a lot of junk food even if it is vegan) I also think Tonya while well meaning is sort of a stereotype a lot of people have about vegans (nomad-hippies etc) and this image makes a lot of people unwilling to try veganism......all in all this film is pretty much for people who arejust starting out"
3,Very Unstable If Used With Extension Legs,"Don't use the extension legs or your cooking will end up on the groud. Happened to me. Other than that, the stove works the way as advertised."
3,Perfect for men.,"Packaging did not come with the all of the necessary nuts for assembly, nor the assembly instructions for this model. This shouldn't be a problem for you, however, as you are buying a dual turkey fryer. You are a man among men. You have plenty of nuts to spare. And you wouldn't read instructions anymore than you read the articles in the nudie magazines collected on the back of your toilet. So duct tape this thing together and get to frying. Two turkeys at once. Or, if you are into home brewing, make 10 gallons of beer in one go. Because 5 gallons just isn't enough to sate your thirst.What a marvelous age we live in."
1,Totally waste of money,"We purchased this, thinking it has acceptable STARS level and offered by AMAZON. This was for my daughter's birthday party during 4th July long week end. We have some 28 guests in the park, and it was a total fiasco. The burner would not generate enough flame to cook anything....Total useless...another chinese product with issue...I am unable to understand as why AMAZON even offers such garbage...."
3,Love the necklace...,"... but unfortunately, the string broke within two weeks and the pewter bends much more easily than I'd like. Search the web and find a better one. I wish I had done a better search."
1,Not made in US as advertise !!!,"I bought this product because I want to buy Made-In-USA even though is more expensive.This product is made in:1) the emblem was made in Mexico.2) at the bottom of the mug there is a rubber base that says ""MADE IN CHINA""The only thing done in US was the packing and the design of the logo."
1,unable to use,This game will NOT play on WindowsXP despite the minimum requirements listed.Technical support is unavailable so I was never able to play the game--total waste of money.
3,A scary easy puzzle game,"Amber is another first person puzzle game that is also a bit strange , and for some people scary. The graphics are not bad, even though it is a frame by frame view. The puzzles are not really challenging at all, so if your looking for another Myst type game, this is not the game for you. If your looking for an easy going, non-gory, scare type of game, then you have found the right game for you. Some parts of game play are a little confusing, like trying to move around and that sort, but over time you will get use to it. I also was able to finish the game in two days, so it is a bit short, and the ending is kind of dumm. I would also not recommend this game for younger children, it may frighten them to much."
4,One of the better ghost stories ever told,"The title grabbed my attention. Everything about Amber:Journeys Beyond is haunting. The game starts out with a lonely drive to a secluded mansion. This sets the mood perfectly for the rest of the game. Your job is to 'exorcise' three restless spirits that haunt the deserted mansion. You are given many unique tools to help you in your quest.The game manages to scare the player without using blood or gore. Amber successfully captivated my imagination and used that to frighten me. This game is not for the weak at heart.The only negative about the game is its brevity. I found myself wanting more stories at the end. The puzzles are well integrated and not too difficult. If you are looking for a good scare, try Amber: Journeys Beyond."
3,"great game, but ending was a dissapointment","great game, but ending was a dissapointment. I enjoyed it quite a bit, spooky stuff, great realist graphics, but the story just drops all of a sudden, and then its all over. I think it could have been a little bit harder to complete and should have lasted a little longer, I also think the ending was not so great, I feel that the creators should have had a more exciting ending to go with all the excitment throughout the game. Overall I liked it, not a bad game to buy."
2,Not the greatest game...,"For the price, it may be worth your time. The graphics are great, but the actual play is slow. When they say you have to pay attention to detail, they mean it...I would not hav ebeen able to get through this one without hints. It did not take very long at all to get through, and the story is just lame. If this cost more, I would say IT'S NOT WORTH IT!"
4,Journys beyond the usual games into the paranormal,"This game is actually quite fun, and for the price, its worth trying if your interested in the paranormal. Poltergeists and ghosts, this game has it all. My only qualm is the navigation of the game, and some of the places to visit are confusing, such as the under the lake scenes. I has a difficult time figuring our which direction to take, but overall, this game is fun and exciting."
2,Poor Storyline,"I thought the game was dull. It wasn't even scary! The storyline was weak and really didn't have a point to it. The playing screen was also small but the graphics were good. It needs more excitement and adventure. Overall, I was disapointed."
3,Lightly creepy but not great,"I found that the game was interesting, but I wasn't pleased with the ending. I'm a person who likes multiple endings and Amber doesn't have it. Besides that, your co-worker, Roxy, is a very ""perky"" person who tends to become annoying while watching her on the videotape and at the finale. Edwin's story was heart wrenching, and Margaret and Brice's stories were tragic as well. The only thing I have to complain about was how shallow the stories were. Margaret, for instance, touched lightly on World War II but her story never gets any farther than a few rooms with a radio. The graphics were great, as well as the music and techno babble of the paranormal. I just wanted some multiple endings and a new co-worker, but besides that, it was a good buy, but not great."
1,Boo Windows 95,I couldn't even get the game to play (Win 2000) .Script errors: handler not defined. I sent an email to the company and got a response saying it ONLY works on windows 95 (but isn't Win 200 supposed to be backward compatible so what's up with this?). Pretty lame is you ask me. Otherwise was looking forward to playing it.I did peek at the movie in the movie folder and they look fairly lame. Small screen and very pixulated but I guess for when the game was put out that wasn't so bad. Storyline intrigued me so if I ever get to play it I may post again
4,I rather enjoyed this game,"Amber is the first game I ever completely made it through. I bought it and completed it in about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. I used a walk thru to help or else I wouldve been totally lost. Kudos to Hugh Forest on their choice for the actress who played Roxy (Verrrry nice). Also, I found Brice's world to be the most disturbing of the three stories due to his obviously sad state of mind. The first story was great in that it was very environmental and in made you feel you were back in the 40's, especially with the radio announcer in the background. I recommend this game for everyone. It is creepy but not to the point where your kids cant watch you play. Only a couple of scenes really gave me a cause to pause and feel sad for the victims. Well done on an emotionally charged game. I look forward to another from this company."
4,Need more hints,"The game is very enjoyable. nice graphics, but it needs more hints throughout the game for game challenged players like myself. The ""Hints>WRI"" file on the cd only gets you started and is very limited."
3,Not The Best Game Produced,"I got Amber from a freind and was so excited to play it. When I started playing, I thought it was an awesome. But, after a few days, I was starting to get bored. The game took too long to load, was very hard to play, got boring, and, after you get into the garden, you get vary vary lost vary vary fast. I am not saying that the game isn't awesome, but it is very boring and very hard to find exits after you get into the core of the game. There is one nice part of the game and that is the under water roller coaster. That was the big highlight for me."
3,customer,"Amber was a tidy little adventure. Not an epic on the scale of Riven or Myst, but definitely entertaining, and a great bargain. Consistently encountered problems in the 3rd story: alwyas extremely slow running and occasionally the program would freeze. Not the kind of game to keep you thinking about it when away from the computer, but nice graphics and occasionally pretty creepy (even scary). At 10 bucks you can't go wrong if you are looking for some light entertainment."
1,Can't play it,"I was suprised to read that other people have played this game. I have windows XP and I cannot get it to play. If someone can tell me how you got this to play, I would very much appreciate it."
1,lameass game,"Absolutely the lamest adventure game I've ever played. Almost no gameplay in it at all. Extremely annoying sequence in which you're stuck with nothing to explore, but you have to keep poking around aimlessly until you get a line of dialogue from your ghost. Two places in which the game hung completely and my machine had to be rebooted. (Do not touch locked doorknob until you have key!! Do not touch trapped clown!!!!)Game is comprised of simple inventory manipulations, with lots of moving around between each step. Only minor puzzles, and few of them at that. Movement is annoying, sight angles are unclear in most of the scenes; very confusing to figure out where you are standing and what you can look at.If you liked Obsidian, or Neverhood, or Rama, or Curse of Monkey Island, DO NOT BUY AMBER: Journeys Beyond!!! It will be a complete waste of your money and time."
4,"Cool, spooky game","I really enjoyed this game. I was turned on to it by some friends who witnessed my frustration with Myst and Riven. They knew my interest in the paranormal and passed this one along. I've had it for several years now and have solved it umpteen times, it's just fun to revisit it once in awhile. The only problem is that I'm running XP now and I've tried changing the compatibility in the computer, but I can't play it anymore. I suppose that the company is out of business or something because their website is non-existant and there is no contact number. Good luck to those running a newer version of Windows who want to play this- it's a great game though!!"
4,Henry Paul Band - Grey Ghost,"1978Atlantic RecordsSongs Include :""So Long""""Crossfire""""Foolin""""Wood Wind""""Grey Ghost""""I Don't Need You No More""""Lonely Dreamer""""One Night Stands""""You Really Know What I Mean""""All I Need"""
5,A Terrific Continuation Of The Outlaws Sound,"On the Henry Paul Band's debut album, GREY GHOST, Paul takes on the task of continuing the sound of the first three Outlaws albums, with incredible results. The title song and ""So Long"" both deal with the subjects of loss and loneliness, the former being a tribute to such lost Southern rockers as Duane Allman, Berry Oakley, Ronnie Van Zant, and Steve and Cassie Gaines. Everything here is a perfect blend of acoustic and electric, just as the Outlaws were, and are, and the surviving members' support for efforts to free Americans jailed in Iran and North Korea on false charges makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
5,Henry Paul Band.....very tasty!,"Real fine stuff by HP and friends. If you liked ""Lady in Waiting"" by the Outlaws, this disc will more than satisfy your appetite for clean, crisp guitar licks and sweet harmonies. Enjoy!"
1,Case Logic Neoprene DVD Player Shuttle,Requested a return authorization the day received. It was not what we thought we ordered. It has been 5 weeks and still no authorization code.
5,Teenage Angst,"Waiting Games is a sequel to the popular book Sooner Or Later. I first read both books when I was 14, and re-read them until they were tattered. Jessie's struggle with first love is both funny and touching. The author's insight into the mind of a teenager, who is both worldly and childlike, is magical."
3,Picks up where sooner or later left off...,"When I first purchased this book, I was expecting a little more insight into Jessie and Michael's relationship after they declared their love for one another in the sooner or later book. I felt that this book did not go into enough detail about the ups and downs of Michael and Jessies realtionship, nor did we really read enough about Michael's feelings at all. The big ""love scene"" was disappointing to say the least and from there Michael's transformation from a great guy to a wafflingjerk took place. The Michael I love from the movie SOL is not in this book nor will you find him in the third installment, Now or Never. I think the movie version has really spoiled me because Rex Smith's portrayal of Michael is totally different. He is maturer, sexier and you could really believe in the love he feels for Jessie."
5,Can't help myself....,"OK -- I probably paid way too much for Now or Never... everybody wants to criticize it, but I think it kind of encapsulates the fumblings and inadequacies of early relationships. Geez do I wish I could have that particular one again - wow! I plan on sharing these w/ my goddaughter when she's ready. Oh boy... I think I'd do it before I was ""ready"" for Michael Skye!!! But really, it's about a simpler time, different place, different kind of people. I was 11 when I saw this - had to hide from my mom! ;-) But oddly never forgot it. Simply Jessie makes me want to learn guitar!"
2,still WAITING for a happy ending,"For fans of the book and movie Sooner or Later, this may be a letdown. I just could NOT see Michael and Jess in these characters. Nor could I see Jessie's parents or Grandma. I get the lesson here. Your first love and lover may not withstand the test of time. But there are other novels that tell that story extremely well, such as Forever by Judy Blume. As a pre-teen, I LOVED the movie and Rex Smith, this was not the happy ending that you hope for. I still LOVE the movie and Rex. I know that life doesn't always have happy endings, believe me I do. But I think a lot of fans of Sooner or Later will wish that it had ended better. I'm waiting for Now or Never, and will read it with an open mind. I think that the book is very good, but not for those hardcore Sooner or Later fans. I had to watch the DVD, just to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
1,Soooooo disappointed,"I can not believe that the Harts did this to Michael and Jessie. They said the only reason that they even made a sequel to Sooner or Later was because the fans ""demanded"" it. I don't think, no I know this is not what they/we wanted. I have ordered the third book ""Now or Never"" and I am hoping it will be better but I'm worried it's not. I haven't heard many good things about it either. And to be honest, I'm almost afraid to read it. What have the Harts done to them now? They say there is room for a 4th book, if so, Bruce and Carole, please write it and make Michael and Jessie live happily ever after. There is a site called ""He's all that"" and they have written their own conclusions to the ""Michael and Jessie"" saga. Maybe Bruce and Carole should take a look at those. ""They"" show how it really should end. Happily!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not What I'd Hoped For,"While the plot is somewhat believable, the changes made to Michael's character just don't make sense with what was set up in the original. It's dragged out and unsatisfying. The ""first time"" scene was a huge disappointment. I really only kept reading because I needed to know what happens to the characters. I guess that's a plus. That I still cared."
2,Very Disappointing Sequel,"Waiting Games is sad when compared to Sooner or Later. Michael and Jessie try to make it work, but fate is against them. I found the ending disappointing, to say the least. It was a complete let down The third book, Now or Never, gives a more satisfying conclusion to the Michael and Jessie story."
4,Good fryer with small complaint,"When you screw on the legs, they have some wobble to them that makes it awkward picking up. Other than that, this thing cranks and gets the job done well!"
4,Great classics!,"This CD was a rare and great find with some of the best R&B and jazzy classics. It took me back, and I have enjoyed the journey! This is a must have for all real music collectors, and most of the songs can not be found on itunes, either!"
5,A great investment!!!,"I have the first three volumes, but this is by far the best. I have had it in my car since the first day, and it has been in my cd player every day since then!!! I can not get enough of this cd, it is well worth the money."
2,"Too much research, not enough insight","I bought this book hoping that it would give me some insights into Latino culture. I teach ESL to Mexican children and I am always looking for better ways to reach these families. This book did not help me. For starters, it is the dryest, most boring, most unreadable book I have ever purchased. Also, it didn't have any information in it that I could really use (for example, Chapter 5 is entitled ""Puerto Rican Elders and Botanical Shops: A Community Resource or Liability?"") This kind of information is not relevant or useful to people who are trying to relate to actual human beings. It has way too much information on how the studies were conducted and raw data from the studies and not enough explanation of how all this data could actually help service people reach the Latino community. I'm sure the research was quite good, for people who like reading that kind of thing, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
3,Not For Me,Bought this remote for a new TV so my wife could have her own remote with larger buttons. The remote works well but it was a learning experience about remotes in general and the complexity of a television's on screen menu's that an inexpensive remote must work with.The problem I did have using this remote was I may hit a menu controlling button on the remote by accident when I only wanted to change channels. This mistake would take me into the TV's menu with no way to control or back out of the menu with this remote. Again it's not this remote but the complexity of the new TV menus and having all of these buttons on a remote that does not have all of the manufactures function programmed into it.May solution was to buy a remote with just the basic buttons large enough for my wife to see.The other thing I learned is I need to get a extra remote from the manufacturer that function properly incase I break the one that came with the TV. A more expensive learning remote may also be a solution.
2,Worked for a while....,"I purchased the Quantum Fx REM-115 remote this year and it worked great for a while. Today I went to use the remote and it has unprogrammed itself. I have tried to find the programming codes via the internet, but have been unable to. Can anyone help me? Without these, the remote is useless.I have a Sanyo TV if anyone could help me!"
1,only lasted 1 day,this product broke the day we received it as well. I believe part of that was because of the shipping but the quality is so low it wouldn't had made a difference anyways. I would recommend getting something else if you want to use it more than one day.
1,8 Functions Jumbo Universal Remote Control TV VCR Cable DVD Satellite,"I could not get it to recognize my tv or dvd player though both are mainstream brands. Sharp and Samsung . It would recognize them partly and would turn off the device when in the auto search mode but would not turn it on again or recognize it for any functions. Quite useless in my opinion,"
2,"Broken, already","I dropped it twice(only off of my bed about two feet high) , and it won't work anymore. Smaller remotes are way more durable than this. It was fun while it lasted, but it died way to quickly. I would NOT buy this product again. Unless they want to send me a new one. So annoying.But it never did get lost, and it was really easy to set (even on my super old TV). It got here on time, and was wrapped really neatly."
2,Jumbo Universal Remote Control,"The first remote control I received didn't work at all. I was sent another one, free of charge, but that one only partially worked. It would turn on the t.v., and the dvd player, but would never program to the Dish Network. I got this for my aging father for fathers day for his poor eyesight. I am quite disappointed in the product, and feel my money was wasted on it."
2,broke after programming the first device,"The product is just what I expected, but it broke after programming the first device. I'll try again with the replacement."
5,Great diapers,I find these diapers work very well for controlling leaks and keeping the poo in. I also really like the Seasame Street characters. They also don't seem to be as stiff as the Huggies Supreme diapers.
5,Henry Paul Goes All-Electric For This One,"For FEEL THE HEAT, the Henry Paul Band's second album, the band cranked up the electric guitars with the battle cry ""Let's ROCK!!!!!!!!"" The result is an incredible album that rocks harder than even Molly Hatchet's work of this period. There are many great songs here, so it's hard to point out highlights. The sound is like the Outlaws hanging out with Ted Nugent. The fact that surviving former members have supported efforts to free Americans jailed in Iran and North Korea on false charges makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
3,Battery For Panasonic KX-TG5110M,I have on base with 4 cordles phones and one battery always seems to be on its way out!!! It could be 1.5 years since I last ordered one. Not many other solutions available for this at any better price.
2,poor,ok thought this item would be good but found out otherwise. the cup is soo small that I can't fit my goodies in to it. and that makes it useless.
3,Edgy averageness,"Alt-country or indie-folk act has been gaining hipster momentum throughout the past half-decade with a simple enough concoction of bruised Americana. Far from being a standout act, OR manages to inject enough gritty integrity into fairly generic compositions to stay afloat."
4,the kind of great that creeps up on you slowly,"okkervil river listens like reading someone's diary: embarassinly personal, full of all the things you never wanted found out, tearing away your pervious conceptions until you are almost sick from too much truth. will sheff's voice catches you off-guard, sometimes almost like a male chan marshall in it's tentitive quavering and at other moments worthy of a tennessee williams play in it's intensity. my personal favorites are ""the war criminal rises and speaks"" and ""the velocity of saul at the time of his conversion."" i don't see the point in comparing these guys to anything. if you do, they're bound to come up short for something like pretentions to uniqueness. okkervil river can stand alone."
5,The President's Dead +4 tracks,"This little EP is really nice. It's the only way to get ""The President's Dead"" on CD. It's currently only available as a digital download or on LP.Track listing is as follows:The President's DeadThe Room I'm Hiding InO, DanaLove To A MonsterWestfall (Live)The live version of Westfall is good, and very diffrent from other live versions/album version."
1,More than a little dissapointed.,"As with the previous review (that I didnt read prroir to ordering), The pad is quite thin compared to other products. It certainly is a pad, but thats about it. There is no foam cushion on the underside which makes the pad very slick on the desk. I have only a laptop and docking station on top and the pad is always sliding around on the desk. Hind-sight being 20/20, I should have spent the extra money as you always get what you pay for and in this case I certainly got a $10 desk pad."
1,disappointed,"I was very excited and couldn't wait for the desk pads to arrive. It was a disappointment with the material as is not very thick compared to other low cost products. The desk pad does not feel good on forearms and although I have speakers, monitor, mouse and keyboard it slides with minimal force. I recommend to spend the extra $10-$15 bucks for a better quality."
3,Give me a break!,"This book was written adequetly, but let me refer to a certain runaway ride. Ashleigh is chasing Caroline and Neptune, and there is a rock in their way. It is a three foot jump, and Ranger clears it with 'feet to spare'! Give me a break! Ashleigh doesn't lose her seating in any way when he jumps oh, six or seven feet and lands badly. I don't believe that she could ride that well."
2,Why?,"I heard that Joanna Campbell was going to write #28 & 29, but when I went into the bookstore to get the new books I found out that a third person wrote another book in the seires. I want racing. I wish that the books were a little more about the horses like in the beinging of the seires unlike it is now when it's about the people who raise the horses. The books are for little kids. and not for fifth graders."
2,Soo boring,"I think if someone starts to read this book in fifth grade and likes the Thoroughbred series the books should get harded and harded so the people that love the books they can read them when they are in high school. And another thing, what happened to all the other people? I miss them. I don't mind that you add more people to the story but forgeting the others is just stupid. Why isn't Joanna Campbell writing the series she started? The other writers don't remember what happend in the books before it. If you can't make the series long with what you started with then you shound stop it short. I think It's O.K. to add jumping to the books but you started out with racing and the books should stay with racing."
5,I loved it!!!!!!!!!!,"How can you not love ""Ashleigh's Hope""? I thought it was a great book. If you don't think it's a good book, then you're crazy. I couldn't put it down. I've loved EVERY Thoroughbred book. I thought it was one of the best. It had humor, suspense, and drama. I laughed, held my breath, and cried right along with the book. For those of you who just dump on the book, get some respect! I truly love every book Joanna Campbell has written and I dearly wish she write more! She is the greatest author!"
5,I was wondering,"I have read all the thoroughbred series books and I like them all, but I've read the comments of other customers and I do have to agree with something. Alot of the characters dissapeared. I love jumping and I do it myself but I also love racing and alot of the old characters are gone. The books don't even tell about the new race horses that are being trained and how Ashleigh's riding her famous race horses. I was wondering where are Cindy, Mandy, Tor, Samantha, Pride, Champion, Glory, Honor ? They have all dissapeared. I have to admit that I'm looking forward to more of the books, but I really wish there was more racing and the old characters come back into the series here, because the books really aren't the same without them. PLEASE BRING THEM BACK !!!!"
2,Wonderfully Odd,"I love the Thoroughbred Series, and I love the characters, but stick to racing. Jumping just doesn't fit! I could never put down one Thoroughbred racing book, with Champion, and Cindy! But please, no more jumping!"
4,"Good book, but not the best in the series.","I think that Ashleigh's Hope is an excellent book. But, I can see why lots of people don't think it's the best in the series. It's definitely a couple of steps down from Ashleigh's Diary and Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle, but I love all the adjectives in it. Joanna Campbell is definitely the best author!"
5,A necessity for telescope builders and fans,"A marvelous little book, and completely unique so far as I can tell. Manly's book is a tour of unusual telescopes. What's an unusual telescope? Well, I suppose it's something you just don't see discussed anywhere else. He discusses unusual mirror and lens materials- obsidian, aluminum foam, mylar, spun mercury and even heated air. Mounts get quite a bit of discussion, sorted by degrees of freedom. There are fixed telescopes, one axis telescopes, and on up to multi-axis sattelite tracking telescopes.This is an expensive little book, but at the same time I think Manly has written a modern classic of the sort people will be consulting well into the next century. Not that this is a dry reference; it's a wonderfully entertaining tour of the world of the possible. I'm very glad I bought my copy."
5,Masterly and fascinating,"I re-read this book from time to time. It is so full of detail, beautifully constructed - and fascinating from the first to the last page.During my most recent re-read of this wonderful book, page-by-page I played the works mentioned from a complete Mozart Edition of CDs - and so got to know some outstanding Masonic Music I'd not heard before.A masterly text - I will read it yet again, soon."
2,Nothing New,"This book didn't cover anything new. A pre-placement parenting class was required for our homestudy for our adoption, and reading this book was like re-taking that class. The same issues (generic) were discussed. Maybe if I hadn't heard all the information before, I would have found this book more valuable."
3,Too Clinical,"I ordered this book & returned it after glancing through it. It seems too clinical & dry. It seemed like reading a college child development book. I'm sure there's lots of good information in there, but I want something that is easier to apply to my life. I also ordered ""Keys to Parenting an Adopted Child"" by Kathy Lancaster, and that seems like a better book to start with for me. Obviously, other people have enjoyed this book though - but it wasn't for me at this point in time (we're in the process of adopting an infant from Russia & don't have kids yet)."
4,Golden Christmas,Thank you for a wonderful Christmas Video that will warm the heart of any dog lover. This video was delightful and very entertaining.
2,Golden Christmas is better!!,"Golden Christmas 2: The Second TailI fell asleep a couple of times during the movie. The first one rocked! I wanted to see Andrea Roth, and Nicholas Brendon in part two. I was so disappointed! I figured the director would create a wedding, and a story revolving around them instead of the parents moving to Florida. Perhaps, another sequel will come out with the entire family included. The Golden Retriever was the best part of the movie, and Chasity Dotson is a poor actress in my opinion."
3,Not Believable,"I'm not a very good critic, not sure to blame the director or the script. There was some good acting, some great acting, and some not so good acting. The main problem I had with the film, was that it just wasn't believable. The dog knocks over an engagement ring in a closed case, and the ring falls out and falls down the sink.... The director had a chance to really end up with a bang, but the final engagement scene was a real dud. But...the dogs were cute, so I gave it three stars instead of the two it deserved."
1,Misleading title and cover,"I am very discouraged with this video. We bought it thinking out children would like to watch for Christmas. Upon walking into the room I found a couple on the video having a sexual encounter in bed and when interrupted the man abruptly says ""damn!"". This is not appropriate for children and we will make certain that a review of future movies is conducted prior to introducing to our children and home."
2,Not nearly as good as the original.,"A Golden Christmas 2 is really not a very good movie. Its only connection to the original are the parents and the golden retriever they own. My wife and I both fell asleep during our first two attempts to watch the film. The story is a best choppy and doesn't flow very well. The puppies are cute and the little girl who plays Lisa's niece does an admirable job in a dull movie. I am being generous by giving this film two stars. I cannot recommend the purchase of this DVD. I really wanted to like this film as much as I did the original, but now I'm sorry I bought it. It is much cheaper than a sleeping pill, but just as effective."
3,Cover is misleading,Funny and good but a drawn-out romance. Based on the cover it looks like a good kid movie about dogs but we were surprised at the long romance scenes.
4,Lighthearted story with very cute goldens,"The story is a typical predictable lighthearted plot of two former lovers getting back together after one is going to get married to someone else while the other enters the picture to change the course of things. The golden retrievers are all very cute! What I also really liked was at about 11:30 into the DVD, there are a couple young ladies walking in bikinis, and the one wearing the pink/purple one has a very nice wiggle to her walk! Wow! The movie was filmed in southern California, so that is very expected. No complaints here! Both the goldens and the bikini backside made me rate this movie a 4-star instead of a 3-star."
5,"Wow, what a fun DVD","My 2 year old loves this DVD. If you have a little boy/girl that's really into numbers, I would highly recommend this product! Don't be surprised if they start counting to 20 the very next day!!! :) Thanks Amazon / Brainy Baby!!"
2,"Hear 1-2-3-4-5 to 20 a hundred times! Very repetitive, boring, but straight forward","I am not sure how should I rate this item. I was searching for a disc that teaches numbers and counting. This does the job very well. It's simple, straight forward, but super boring. Almost put me to sleep when I was watching it with my 19 month old toddler. You hear ONE, and see the number ""1"", and one object appear. This is repeated with different object 3-4 times. Then it goes to TWO. And you hear the count...One, Two....again with a different object, 3-4 times. By the time you get to 20, you have already heard ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE.......a hundred time.There is no pause in between to ""wake up"" the sleepyhead with songs at all. I have to say it's boring. I wish the maker put some songs to entertain the viewer."
5,Nice Tribute to the Original Queen of Disco,All covers/tributes on this artist compilation are led by Divas and Legends' within themselves. Just wish that instrumental or remixes were available for all using original House Mixer of the 80's.
2,Curtis as a constructor of ABorignal Identity,"Although some of Curtis's photgraphs may be pleasing to the eye, he was defintely not an ""ethnographer"" in the strictest or loosest terms! Based on Curtis's onw ""preception"" of Aborignal peoples and Nations, he not only erased evidence of ""modernity"" from his pictures but traveled with a box of ""props"" he used to construct the ""authentic"" and ""real"" ""Indian.""Perhaps if one is interested in Foucualtian discourse/power analysis, this book could provide a fascinating glimpse in the process of colonization and racism that worked and still does, to build the Canadian and American Nation!"
4,"I was suspicious, but this version really is great...","I am a longtime Paperport user who clung to version 9 after a horrible experience with version 10 (see my review of that disaster) and after reading all the negative reviews of version 11. Then we hired a new IT consultant and he asked me why I was still using version 9. I told him and he said his firm had been using and recommending version 11 for a year with no problems.So, with great trepidation, I took the leap about six months ago and I'm very pleased with the program and the new features. I completely agree with Quantumgravity's 5/3/07 review. Since I bashed version 10, I thought it only fair that I set the record straight on this version."
1,Product doesn't perform as advertised,"After having used this product since version 4, each version had its problems. The latest version 11 has improved document indexing and searching - a LITTLE bit - over version 10. It does NOT scan both sides of pages as it did in version 10. The ""Capture Assistant"" crashes the program. If you need support due to bugs in the program, you have to pay, and pay, and pay."
1,Wish I could give a ZERO- BUYER BEWARE,"If only I could get the hours I spent, trying to resolve all the issues that came up with this software. This is a VERY poor product. I am a small business owner and this software program has been very costly from downtime. I spent two weeks of computer tech hell. The only way I was finally able to clear all the problems this software caused was to reformat my computer.(by the way my computer is only 3 month old and I still run on xp) I can not believe that they can sell this software with so may bugs and get away with it.I can not express how bad this problems is. If you want to lose hours of your life and be stuck in some bizarre tech staff hell than this is the product for you!!"
2,customer service IS the issue,"I have used and loved PaperPort for years - just got version 11 and it has bugs. The knowledge base is useless and you can't email a question without paying $10!!! this is crazy. First phone call is free, but $20 each after that. Crazy! How does this company expect to survive? I've left them a message by phone and hope they step up and resolve my issues. If they do, I'll gladly follow this with a positive comment. But till then, I'd hold off buying this product."
1,Was great.....in the past.,No Support. You have to pay $9.95 to send an email support question. Still cannot print annotations in PDF files that you create. There is a workaround. Nuance should change their name to Nuisance. I hope that someone comes up with an alternative.
1,This version is terrible,"I used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it. Boy are they right. This thing is terrible.After installing on Windows XP SP2, as soon as I started the program it crashed. Now every time I try to scan using my Canon Scanner, it crashes every time.Product is useless. Wish I had of never bought it!DO NOT BUY!!"
1,Do not upgrade if you have version 9,"I had version 9 which I found stable and very helpful. I fell for Nuance claims Paperport 11 Professional had better indexing and other better features. Very big mistake. This is awful awful software. The indexing doesn't work, what others say about it crashing constantly is correct. The PDFs created somehow are hard to read. This software is a joke. No patches on the horizon. It must be because of Nuance buying the software. If you have a Pre-Nuance version 9, by all means stick with that. The people who wrote reviews praising this software must be out of their minds."
1,Stay far far away,"I have been a Paperport user for many years. Version 11 is full of bugs, frequently hangs running under Vista, and there is noooooooo help from Tech Support unless you are willing to part with $9.95 per call. Emails to Tech Support are answered with stock replies, if at all. Save yourself a lot of frustration, don't buy or upgrade to Version 11 if you running Vista."
1,I am stupid,"My only conclusion, after reading numerous reviews, mostly negative, and purchasing this software (as an upgrade) anyway, is that I must be totally stupid. I suppose I was overly optimistic - version 8 worked pretty well, this had to be an improvement, right? Wrong. This is a totally unreliable piece of software. Despite installations on three different machines with different scanner configurations, the software crashes, freezes up, and/or suddenly rejects the scanner at some arbitrary point during scanning. There should be a law against marketing this kind of stuff and making the kind of promises Nuance does. Criminal!"
1,"Didn't work, didn't start, nada","I installed the ""free 15 day trial"" version of PP Pro 11 from a website download. The install was slow but successful.Something did start - an indexing program appeared on my system tray. My first ditch to drive into was to tell it to index the PDF files on My Documents. It indexed every single file there.Next, I clicked on the friendly ""paperport"" shortcut on my desktop. Nothing happened. I rebooted. Clicked on the not-so-friendly-now shortcut, again. Nothing happened, again.Found out I would have to pay $9.95 to report this problem via email.My next stop was the uninstaller and a visit to Nuance's website to cancel the ""free trial"" which would have cost me $199.99 in 15 days.Whew! Close one, Eddie. Such bogus stuff. How did they get to version 11.0? Do they multiple their internal alpha releases by 10 and start from there?"
1,"Bugs, Crashes, and Junk","This software really is a stinker. While it does do some things right, like making PDF files and giving some scanner profile options, the thing just crashes too much. I'm too scared to uninstall and reinstall it because the software will deactivate and I will have to probably pay for a support incident via email (no phone support available). What a really bad company. I am currently shopping for something else after having thrown 200 bucks down the pit."
1,WHY PAY FOR HELP?,PAPER PORT HELP USED TO BE FOR FREE...NOW TO ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION THEY WANT TO CHARGE YOU...........I HAVE USED THIS FOR 20 YRS..AND NOW NO FREE HELP? THEY CAN TAKE THERE PROGRAM AND SHOVE IT
2,Disappointed with the big price tag,"I have been using Paperport since it came from my visioneer scanner for about 9/10 years and since then upgraded a few versions. After reading hyped-up product features of version 11 from Nuance website, I cannot justify upgrading my paperport software to PRO given its current cost. I am pretty sure that a lot more people (especially loyal users like me) would snap it up if it was little cheaper. I will probably wait for some time for price to go down.... It will also need time to stabilize ( no patches yet !!!) and become compatible with Vista. For those of you who got lotsa money (please send me some), I would recommend Paperport as a decent doc managment s/w."
1,Doesn't work for me,"I have been a user of PaperPort since it came bundled with Visioneer. With each successive upgrade the product became worse - more bloated, slower, and buggier. Simple things like remembering default scan settings don't work. Now this version 11 crashes every time I scan. I have to force quit using Task Manager. And to report this to them I have to pay them. Totally unacceptable. I will never buy another version of this software again. Stay away. Be warned."
2,This Paperport version is slower than 9!,"Nuance touts that there is a major speed improvement from the previous versions, but my personal experience shows that it is even slower. The new features are not that great either. I wish I did not upgraded to this version."
2,"Tech Support, Customer Service-Terrible","BEWARE-Tech Support is expensive. Their online ""knowledge"" base has not answered any question so far. Must pay to email a question. Poorly documented and poorly designed program (from a users perspective). I am guessing it is well designed from a corporate perspective, design badly and then charge for help to figure out how to use it. A good scam if you can run it. The idea of paperport is good but the implementation is flawed. Decent tech support would go a long way, but as it is, look at alternatives. I wish a good company would buy the software and do something with it."
1,Never gets fixed,"I have tried everything to get this product working. I have tried three scanners, three different computers, made sure that the USB cable was not ""too long"", used the $9.99 support, downloaded the latest drivers 7 times, hired a software PC expert that fixes problems on PCs for a living and gone to a blog where Paperport is discussed.All to no avail. If I try to scan in a stack of paper, it might work for one week after which it will only scan in one sheet before complaining that the device could not be initialized. When it works, it is quite neat. One keeps thinking that sooner or later they will fix the problems and the product would not be getting so many bad one-star reviews.For now, it remains one star.Perhaps there is someone who has everything working and they could tell us which scanner and computer they are using."
1,Nothing but crashes and freezes,"This product is an abomination. The concept is grand, the execution pitiful. It freezes constantly doing a basic operation - after you scan a document, click on the PDF file to open it. Try to scroll or select a page in the document without every page completely loaded (you won't know this if the document has more than 5 pages because the loading thumbnails are off-screen) and the computer freezes. Every time. This is 2009. No patches to fix this have been released in the years since release.I have Windows XP Professional."
5,very useful,"This book has a number of discussions of useful imagery, for specific problems. I would compare it toAmazing Secrets of Psychic Healing, and say that the drawings here are better. The visualizations are more detailed. The discussion on mind-body connection is good. This book would be a good adjunct toYou the Healer: The World-Famous Silva Method on How to Heal Yourself and Others, on the energy side, andThere Are No Incurable Diseases: Dr. Schulze's 30-Day Cleansing & Detoxification Program, for the physical side. The pointers for developing your own imagery are very useful."
5,Revealing!,"I recently bought three books of this author and loved them all, to say the least. In Healing Visualizations, Dr. Epstein's oldest book still in print, I very much liked the concise and easy to understand introduction to visualisation. His explanation of the relationship between emotions, images and sensations was a true revelation to me: ""An image is the mental form of a feeling. But there is also a physical form - sensation."" You can't put it plainer and this realisation alone to me is worth the purchase. Also, the advice at the end of the book on how to develop my own imagery proved very valuable.I found the image exercises clearly worded, easy to perform and convincing. Of course, I tried out only a few. So far I have experienced no physical healing but things look much ""brighter and clearer"". And thanks, Dr Epstein, for all the encouragement along the way!"
2,Questionable use,"I got sick for the first time in years shortly after getting this book. I did the visualization over and over, but it still took a long time to get well. It did help pass the time I guess."
3,Does it work?,"The treatment is explained very well in the book, but more examples and cases from patients and the results obtained with the treatment should be needed to convince the reader that the treatment really works. It is clear that to have success with the treatment, it is required high doses of faith in it. Therefore the author should explain cases of people cured with such treatment to make easy the reader to believe in it, an as a result increase the likelyhood his curation."
4,yo-yo party,"The yo'yos are very responsive. The inserts for the sides are a little tricky, but the kids enjoyed decorating them."
5,Our wedding song was on this,"I heard a song from this album (You're The One) on our videographer's sample and I had to get the album. It is the best. My wife walked in to ""The One He Kept for Me"" and a friend of ours was singing it live. The darn song made me cry! In any case, I highly recommend it. ""You're The One"" is hot!"
5,Truly a Godsend,"This album is perfect for weddings, anniversaries, and the marriage in between. I was looking for a non-traditional wedding song that reinforced my belief that a marriage takes three (husband, wife, and God), I came across the perfect song for my wedding on this album. GO GET THIS ALBUM!!!"
4,Wedding Music help!,"The hardest part of the planning is finding the right music. The songs on this CD are beautiful - I really like the song ""Still In Love With You"". I also like ""I Will Be Here"" from the O'Neill Brothers' three CD's ""A DAY TO REMEMBER"" - I found their CDs to be perfect and absolutely beautiful wedding music!"
5,BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!IT'S ONLY ... AND IT'S PURE FUN ;),"I DON'T LISTEN TO REVIEWS!I MYSELF HAVE TO RATE IT!IT'S SO GREAT!WHERE DO I START!GAMEPLAY-10/10EVERYTHING IS GREAT FROM COMBO ATTACKS TO PICKPOCKETING GUARDS.

3,weedeater clipstick,I love my weedeater clipstick...It's lightweight and handy . It's battery makes it have cordless convenience without using gas.However I need a new battery...as i've had it for years and don't know where to get one...
2,About the Weedeater Cordless Clipstik Trimmer,The Weedeater Cordless Clipstik Trimmer is a very convient trimmer as you do not have to carry an electrical cord around but is very difficult to find the Clipstik replacement line which without makes it useless. So for that reason I won't buy another one. Product parts availability is a must.
5,Moving and fascinating memoir,"A poignant and well-written memoir filled with humor and pathos. A young man's struggle with the philosophical and social conflicts of being a German fighting on the side of his adopted home, America. Frazier describes some interesting pre-war times in Berlin and then describes his wartime experiences with intelligence and passion. I highly recommend it."
2,Non-Performer,The Antenna was no better than my stock antenna. Did not perform that great. Would return but for price of return it was not worth the price.
1,worthless,"I bought this some time ago but never really used it until the last couple of days after I purchased the Sangean HDT-1X. The antenna that came with it wasn't very good so I dug out the Terk Tower. The tower was completely worthless, actually worse than the simple diapole that came with the tuner."
2,Works but not much better than a hanger!,"I thought I would receive at least the local stations, but I only get two station in clear, that was the only improvement from not having an antenna!"
1,Marginaly better than nothing,"This unit will probably work just as well as the basic wire antenna kit that came with the stereo. If you have nothing at all, this may work, but it's really not worth the money"
1,Piece of wire is better,"Actually, $5 passive antenna from other company makes it possible to receive FM station located 50 miles away from my place. This one gives only static"
5,Great Antenna!!!,I bought the amplified Terk tower antenna in 1978 for my new Pioneer SX850 receiver. I just a bought another vintage receiver for my woodshop in the garage. I took the old SX850 out to replace the burned out lamps. I used the Terk antenna on my Kenwood in my woodshop and was amazed how well it works. I finished up the Pioneer and put her back in the cabinet along with the Terk tower antenna. The antenna did what it is supposed to do. My weak signals are strong and the stereo quality is excellent. You have to realize that there has to be a signal for this antenna to work. It won't pull a signal out of nowhere. I restore vintage stereo receivers and shortwave radios as a hobby and this antenna is a keeper as far as I am concerned. As a matter of fact I just ordered a new Terk amplified antenna for my woodshop stereo. I also have the Terk AM/FM antenna thats not amplified. Not happy with that one. Have to move it all over the place when I change the station.
2,no better than wire antenna provide with radio,"Terk provides a much neater situation using the Tower, but there is no enhanced reception for the money spent. The device was returned. A waste of money in my case"
1,Doesn't work at all,"Terrible. Tried several positions (flat and upright), nothing seemed to improve reception. May as well not have been plugged in at all. Let's say the 1 star is for the lighted green dial on the front, since I can't give it zero stars..."
1,Works almost as good as not having any antenna at all,"I had this thing connected to my radio for quite a while, then one day my reception improved noticeably. I looked behind and the terk tower cable had fallen loose from the radio. So my radio worked better with NO antenna than with the Terk Tower.I can only imagine that my issues are multi-path type problems and not signal strength. Whatever, this gadget didn't work for me. And it had that green light too!"
1,Do not waste your time or money.,This FM antenna is a complete failure. I live 18 miles from Philadelphia antenna farms. Nothing but static and weak signals everywhere in the house with this thing on quality receivers. I get better reception with the wired antenna packaged with my receivers. Still searching for a company that can produce a decent FM antenna after two tries. Terk clearly cannot do this!
1,Pure Junk !!,bought 2 of them for 2 different stereo's in the houise and a long piece of speaker wire got better reception than this piece of junk
2,TERK TECHNOLOGY AF 9330 AM/FM ANTENNA TOWER,"I HAVE AN OLDER MODEL OF THIS SAME STYLE OF ANTENNA THAT HAS ALWAYS WORKED GREAT. I BOUGHT THE TERK TECHNOLOGY AF 9330 AM/FM ANTENNA TOWER THINKING IT WOULD WORK THE SAME, IT DOES NOT RECIEVE STATIONS VERY GOOD."
1,Product Review,POS!!! A FM Dipole antenna out performs this amplified antenna ten fold. A tuned antenna is the key. Not recommended!!! This is just my opinion and I'm writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review. Really!!! AYFKM. Jusy Saying.
1,The Terk Technology Antenna Tower simply doesn't work in my apartment.,"Cannot seem to get it to work. Perhaps it is because I live on high floor of concrete and metal building. I suspect that I will have to rearrange my furniture to get antenna in place where it would receive FM signals. It is now on window sill of window construct of metal. Wires are not long enough to accommodate it elsewhere. Strikes me as strange that a > 50 year old table radio with no visible antenna (perhaps it is in power cord) picks up signals virtually anyplace. I'll keep trying, as I would appreciate gettng the AF9330 working. Owing to recent death in my immediate family, I did not have the energy to return it to Amazon, so it is probably too late to do so now."
3,AM/FM Antenna Tower,The antenna was easy to install and the signal was improved but not as much as I had hoped.......it works just not strong enough for me
4,Great Item for the price,"Works great. The ony drawback is that the cord connecting it to your Amp/Am/Fm receiver is not quite long enough to place it properly. If your Amp/Am/Fm is not placed near a window your antenna needs to be placed near the window and the cord is not always long enough to do that. With it, I can pull in radio stations that before I could only hope to hear. Definately a good buy."
1,Too Good To Be True,This antenna did not help my problem whatsoever.Didn't return it because it may make a good doorstop someday.
3,It has a nice green light.,"This powered antenna picked up less than half the stations my unpowered wire dipole picked up. It's ok if you don't want to tack a dipole to your wall. The tricky part is that you have to turn it counter-clockwise to increase gain. Mine is several years old, so I don't know if they've changed that part of the design. I was able to confirm this as my Sangean HD radio has a signal strength meter on the FM and HD signals. Signal strength was REDUCED by turning the gain knob ""up."" A very confusing, silly design. It's better than nothing, but a properly mounted wire dipole is way better and way cheaper."
2,Weak Amplification,"I am dissappointed with this product. I live roughly 30 miles from a DC, but only 20 miles from a radio tower. This antenna is not strong enough to pick up FM stations. I am able to pick up stations, but they all have static. It doesn't matter how I move or tweak the antenna, there is still too much static. I do not listen to the radio, because of the antenna."
4,Terk = NPR,"I bought the Terk on the advice of friends so that I could reach the closest NPR station, 65 miles away, on the ocean. It's the ""on the ocean"" that has been the problem.Terk needed an adaptor for the plug-in which Radio Shack supplied in 10 seconds. Works great."
4,Nice spreader,"Nice spreader for those areas where a wheel based spreader doesnt work right.It definately could use something to prevent it from turning over if picked up by the straps...and be prepared to be stained by whatever you are spreading as it hits your arms, stomach and lower body. Be sure to wear long sleeves and long pants..and it'd be best to wear a facemask.I'm pleased with the product and the service. Definately recommended."
4,Good Reference,"I just passed the CCA 4.0 test using This book as my study guide. Other than a couple of glaring errors it was well written:Page 42 incorrectly states that the farm will continue to function for ""up to 48 hours"" following a datastore failure. It's actually 96 hours.Pg 248 incorrectly states that there are only 14 anonymous user accounts - There are actually 15If I were a betting man, I'd bet that all three of those things would make good test questions."
5,Great as a Reference Book,This book has all the language syntax listed in concise format. It is great for learning and memorizing the CFMX tag and function syntax quickly and thoroughly.
4,Understandible & Straight Forward,"I purchased this book not only as a study guide but as a desk top reference when programming since I lost my copy of MX7 ""WACK""Macromedia ColdFusion MX 7 Web Application Construction Kitto a friend who borrowed it. Though not necessarily for the beginner, someone already programming in CF is who I'd recommend this book for but even a newbie would benefit as it has clear chapters, so you can find exactly what you're looking for. You should have another programming background so you don't feel like it's talking over your head. Definitely worth the price (especially here on Amazon) to have it added to your collection of reference books because of it's small size and no filler pages. There are a few code typo's but you should always double check code anyways and not rely on copying code verbatim, else how will you learn?"
1,Missing 50 critical pages,"The book would be invaluable if it weren't for the fact that 50 critical pages are missing. I had the first book replaced, and what do you know, there was the same 50 pages missing in the replaced book. Seems it might be a publishing error."
2,Not for beginners,"I'm not an etymologist by any means, but have an interest in understanding the poetry of the pictographs. There is a lot here to digest, and it would help if there were no doubts about its accuracy. How else would a beginner learn the correct things? The publisher has a responsibility to get a new revision.In additon, there should be an update to hanyu pinyin, which is the official mainland China romanizaton. Wade-Giles is really out of date (I was brought up on this) and not helpful when trying to make sense of the new literature in China which may use HanyuPinyin together with the new attenuated pictographs."
4,"Good, old fashioned adventure","CVIE vol IIIGold and Iron play no more than a metaphorical role in this early Vance story. The original title, Slaves of the Klau, while considerably less poetic, is more accurate. The story concerns an Earthman and a woman from another, more advanced race, who are taken captive by the Klau.This is a very John Campbell-esque story, in that it's apparently early that only Earthmen, despite their low level of civilization, have the strength and dynamism to keep going in the face of adversity. There's little of the usual Vance wordplay and aloof would-be sophisticates come in only via the aliens. Instead, it's a straightforward adventure story. That said, it's still well-written, and worth reading.Not a good introduction to Vance, but if you're looking for good old fashioned space opera, when men were men (and women were unfortunately mostly decorative), this fits the bill."
1,"This book gets a ""no pass""","I bought this book for $1.78 used from Amazon. I am afraid that is about what it is worth. Remarkably lacking in practical knowledge. Some information so out of date, twice I went back to the copyright page to be sure I hadn't misread the 2006 publishing date."
1,Disappointed! Ruined an $1800 guitar's finish!,I used this EXACTLY according to the instructions and now I have a quarter sized water spot on the back of my guitar. I am sick at my stomach over this. I soaked it. I rung it out for 5 freaking minutes and dried it off. Three days later the wood under the finish is ruined. I couldn't be more disappointed in a product at this point.
2,What I got is not what is pictured,"The picture shows a sound hold cover of some dark material which I hoped would be more flexible than the brittle clear material that the last one I bought was made of. That one cracked and split. I couldn't be sure what that dark material was, but I hoped it would be better - it couldn't be worse.I was bummed when I got another clear, brittle plastic cover, just like the last one.Also, there is no clip on the tube like in the picture. You have to make do with putting the loop of string around the end of the tube.this is the first time this has happened to me buying from Amazon."
4,Dampit Guitar Humidifier,This device appears to work. Of course the real test is in time. If the guitar doesn't dry out in a couple of years. Hopefully this device will prevent that from happening. The only draw back I experience with this device is it seems like I have to keep putting water in it every couple of days. I'm thinking about buying a room humidifier.
3,it does the work.,"be careful when inserting it into the sound hole, it could make permanent marks on the finish of the guitar and make sure to wipe off excessive water from the tube."
4,I think it's working?,"I've used this for a few months now and I believe it's working, but similar to multi-vitamins, there really is no way to tell. You just have to trust it. My guitar sounds great and seems to not be dried out. I bought the Dampit because it gets very dry here in the winter and I thought this would help. A little TLC for my guitar, if you will. Definitely wring it out after soaking it in distilled water because it will drip inside your guitar, which could obviously create a much larger issue. I don't bother with the plastic piece either. Seems to be fine without it."
2,Hard to use constantly in the long run,"Maybe I'm not using it correctly, but it seems like it's hard to maintain and use this consistently because you need to wet it, and it dries out fairly quickly (on the order of day to days). Every time I open my case, the damp-it is completely dry (and I assume not useful anymore). And it takes some effort to wet it since you need to make sure it's not dripping wet and dry it off a tad. After awhile, I just stopped using it. I'm sure it's effective, but it seems impractical to use on a daily basis."
3,Missing part,"Having used the sponge-in-a-traveling-soapbox trick for decades, I decided to move up. I have no idea how the Dampit works as I just got it today, but most people say they work well.I am just writing this review because I never got the little clip that holds it to the guitar. It isn't worth sending back and it isn't worth my time to make a clip, so the thing will probably lay around til I get tired of looking at it and throw it out."
4,Simple and it works!,Works well - easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers I've had.
4,"Good product, bad instructions","The Dampit Super works good, nice larger size, but the instructions leave much to be desired for detail oriented people. Taylor guitars has a good write-up about using humidifiers and gives simple advice with illustrations. Check it out:[...]"
1,"DONT get NEW one, GET OLD one","do NOT get the NEW design... the tube/cover is the same but the only difference is that the INDICATOR comes in 3 circles design on a separate card. IT'S INCONVENIENTLY separate from the clear plastic soundhole cover... this is not ideal when consistently opening and checking the guitar...the old one was good, but this NEW one is CRAP... try to find the Old one if you can because the old one had an indicator strip of 5 bars and it was attached to the soundhole cover"
3,It works sorta,"I really don't have any basis for comparison as I am new to the guitar and thus new to guitar humidifiers. This thing did raise the humidity in my case but it did not get it up to the ""safe zone."" So, either I live in a really dry apartment or I need to buy a few of these to get it humid enough. If it takes more than one of these things to work, that could get expensive real quick..."
1,Spend more wisely.,"This book compiles information readily available for free.This book is not for beginning genealogists. An advanced genealogist will already have attained the details this book provides. SAVE YOUR Money and spend it on ""The Everything Family Tree Book"" by William G. Hartley or some other suitable reference manual."
4,whar was I thinking?,"whar was I thinking? I didnt realize this was the single. oh well, I still like it. The b side is good."
1,poorly designed,"Two problems and solutions:1. The paint where your pot sits burnt off creating a nasty paint burn on pots and pans (reported by other reviews). I finally just sanded off the paint. This will result in rust which will happen either way!2. The burner is too low from the cooking surface. Due to this, even light wind will blow off flame (reported by other reviews as well). Also waste of propane as you have to turn it up in order to achieve adequate heat. Solution: I cut a !.5 in hole/notch on the wind screen, got a longer screw (metric), and put enough washer under the burner to elevate it about 1.5 inches. Cost of parts: drill bit, metric screw, washes ~$20!Called Bayou and Mike essentially said ""I'm the only one with this problem and it's too bad""!"
4,Incomplete air valve assembly,The first one Amazon sent me did not have the air valve assembly and I returned it. The second one had the air valve plate but not the spring required to use it. Bought it aftermarket. If you buy one of these you need the air valve assembly and the spring.[...]
1,WARNING!,"WARNING! I made a purchase from this seller who shipped me something I didn't want (the description said ""bracelet"" but that was *not* what they sent). Upon returning the item I was not refunded any shipping costs, despite the fact that the ad said the item was a ""bracelet"" and that is *not* what they sent me.Do they made a profit from the $2.50 shipping charge for sending me some tiny little piece of metal? (it cost me only $0.83 to send it back). I will NEVER buy from these people again, please make a better choice than I did!"
3,Good songs and not good songs,"This is an alright cd. It has some good songs and some songs that arent. Songs like Epitaph, The Nomad, Wolftribe, and Revalation Of A Black Mosses are incredible but songs like Whisper, When Darkness Calls, Torch Of War, The Code, and Lukewarm Race i just cannot listen to the beat gets boring the solos are boring, the bad songs sound the same, But the rest is good. I wouldnt Buy unless your a HUGE Vader fan. It was Really Dissapointing:("
2,Nothing New. Very Disappointing.,"Same tired riffs, only I had to wait 'till the third track to hear blast beats!? And the production is a bit weak compared to some of their past albums. Well, at least Doc's faster than ever!For quality Vader, get De Profundis."
4,Sweet Bear,"I purchased this for my [...]daughter because she loves to do the buttons and zippers on my clothing. This is an adorable bear, worthy of the Gund name. The white ribbon tie is on the back of her hat. The buckle is on the back of her jacket. The ribbon tie is fastened with a small white stitch that must be cut to undo the tie. I guess this is to prevent people in the store from undoing it before it is purchased. The reason I gave this bear 4 stars is because the fabric for the buckle is not long enough for little hands to properly fasten. It's hard enough for me as an adult, and not appropriate for a child's small motor skills. In addition to the ""teach me"" aspects, the materials are variable patterns and textures. My daughter and I are very happy with her new friend!"
5,I loved it,"This book is excellent and beautifully written. Prior to reading it, I didn't know too much about Ralph Abernathy, but after reading this book, I know realize how important he was to not only Dr. Martin Luther King but the civil rights movement itself. A truly remarkable human being who defines what courage really is. Highly recommended."
5,MLK Exposed,"MLK was ""caught in the act"" by MLK closest friend Ralph Abernathy, King's hand-picked successor as president of S.C.L.C. from 1968 to 1976Because Mr. Abernathy ""was there from beginning to end, from the Montgomery bus boycott in the late autumn of 1955 to Memphis in the spring of 1968"", this man was an eye witness to the real MLK.A false impression has been exposed by MLK's closest friend Ralph Abernathy. The impression MLK was honorable.Mr Abernathy also has given us insight into some of the mass media's coverup of the ""civil rights"" movement.A book that everyone should read."
3,Ma Made forvDiabetics? replaced real sugar for Stevia ?,"I knew this product for a long time in Europe, now I made this with replacement sugar "" Stevia "" and instead of 4 lbs sugar I used 3 lbs of Stevia . It id't pass the setting test, cooked it extra time and then decided to fill the jars .I got 4 little jars out of this can ! I think the faux sugar Stevia might be the reason . I will make this again with real sugar and see how much jam I get out o this can. As marked 6 Lbs I doubt that is a reality .Will taste mine tomorrow."
3,too expensive - it costs only two pounds in Britain!,wish I could find this cheaper - 400% markup is steep just to import it! Makes the best marmalade after fresh oranges which are hard to find!
2,A Different Sound,"""Henry Paul"", the last relase from the Henry Paul Band, is not as good as the first 3 CDs from the band. While this CD is not terrible in its own right, it does suffer in comparison to the first 3 HPB CDs. Seems to me the band was going for a more country pop sound on this CD. The tracks that don't fit under the country pop label are more like...rock numbers, I suppose. If you are a Henry Paul Band fan, then you should have this CD to complete your set. As I said, it is not terrible, just different. If you are just getting into the Henry Paul Band, get the other 3 CDs first."
1,Inaccurate info,"This CD keeps popping up on my sign in page @ Amazon. I strongly disagree with the first two statements, they're absolutely false. Henry was Not a founding member of the Outlaws, maybe he was in the first iteration that recorded, but he wasn't there in '68 when Hughie Thomasson and others formed the band. Secondly, the Outlaws didn't ""break up"" when he left. They went on to bigger arena's. Far from breaking up, they went on to reach greater success.Henry himself is a niche player. Now that HT has passed, RIP, he has come back for the 4th time to try to take control of the Outlaws. I didn't like any HPB CD but the first, ""Grey Ghost"", when he thought he might replace Ronnie Van Zandt. All downhill from there, IMHO. If you enjoy the HPB, you may need this, but only if you truly LOVE the HPB. Otherwise, ""Grey Ghost"" is the only one worth buying. Be sure to look for the new Outlaws release at the end of the summer, ""Once an Outlaw"". HT's swan song. It's a great work.Pete"
4,Excellent CD,"The MS Mass Choir delivers once again. ""A Widow's Love"" is a must hear. It brought tears to my eyes."
4,Kal Xylitol,"Great Xylitol product. It is powdery and dissolves very quickly as compared to some of the competition, which takes forever to dissolve and sits at the bottom of your drinks"
3,stevia not,if your looking for a natural sweetner get kal stevia or now stevia.the sweetness in stevia is much better and only a small amount is needed.
1,Car Selling 101: The Basics,"This book is privately published and has not had the benefit of an editor or anyone who can use a dictionary for that matter. It is sprinkled with fancy words that invariably fall out of context, and is poorly punctuated - to put it generously. The language of the moderately literate, trying unsuccessfully to sound otherwise.Writing ability aside, this book fails to deliver much valuable information to the reader about the automotive sales business. You would be much better off with a good general sales book. The last part of the book is unrelated to sales, becoming a narration of the author's experiences with discrimination against minorities in the workforce and a political rant."
3,Beware ... some tracks sourced from mp3 files,"'26 Mixes' is a decent collection that could have been better. Several of the tracks are edited (At The Heart Of It All, Mindstream, and others) and at least two tracks - 'Philip Glass - Heroes (Aphex Twin Remix)' and 'Saint Etienne - Your Head My Voice (Voix Revirement)' were sourced from mp3 instead of the original masters! There are some really great tracks on this disc but you are better off with the original releases if you can find them.My advice ... stay away and save your money."
5,Raising the Titanic,"Worth the price of entry alone for his 'Big Drum' mix of Gavin Bryars' 'Raising the Titanic'. Absolutely beautiful, perhaps the best thing he's ever done in my opinion.The Heroes mix is especially good too.Doesn't sound remotely like Drukqs, so don't be put off if you weren't a fan.Well lush."
2,Bleeps. Bloops. Kinda blah.,"I bought this after hearing the remix of Gavin Bryars' ""Sinking of the Titanic,"" (the original is a beautiful piece of music; the remix is cool, too). The rest of 26 Mixes, well....Disc 1 is ok, but most of the tracks make their points early and then go on for too long. Disc 2 is, however, pretty lousy. Apparently, taking a tune, dicing it up and making it sound like basically a hard drive crashing is of interest to some folks. It's of interest to me, too .... briefly."
1,WTF?!?!,I don't know why in the world this weirdo would make this noisey machine-fart of an album for country great Johnny Cash.where as Mr Cash is mainly acoustic guitars this Apex Twin guy is a lot of weird noise. I don't like this album and I don't think Johnny Cash does either considering he's hasn't talked about it in any of his recent interviews.
4,worth the cash,"it's amazing that alot of this work here on this 2 cd set was done over the period of many many years but still sounds quite coherent. it just goes to show the staying power of aphex twin. there are some great tracks here: the Nobukazu Takemura remix is excellent as is the Saint Etienne workup. i'm closer to all the ambient pieces here rather than the dancefloor workouts; but it's all quite well done so i can't complain. well...maybe one little complaint...the Phillip Glass track, ""Heroes"" sounds horrible to me and i have to skip it everytime i listen to disc one. i know alot of people love that track...but Bowie's vocals bug me to no end on that one. ahh well...."
5,aphex twin delievers,"Aphex Twin can never really make a bad CD. He's too good at experimentation for that. 26 Mixes is a good blend of the sounds that have been come to be known as Aphex Twin. Blending together a wide range of sounds on these remixes, you really see how Richard can not only make wonderfully lucid beats on his own, but improve other beats as well. I don't suggest this cd for new-comers to the world of Aphex, but to those who've come to enjoy his sounds, I highly suggest this CD."
4,"APHEX TWIN = UNIQUE, GROUNDBREAKING, AND ORIGINAL","Once again he has done it. He shocks and aww's us every time he comes up with an album. This one is composed of many remixed tracks, but they seem like completely different tracks because they are so different from the originals. The two disks are well composed.They work well with eachother. If you like APHEX TWIN you will like this double disk set! The way he puts the noise together is very unusual and highly stimulating, which makes it very attractive! This is a must have for music enthusiasts! CHECK IT OUT AND ENJOY AN EAR RIDE!"
4,you've heard these and you'll like 90% of them,"um, that was pretty much it...you know the twin, he can rock it out and this spans over his whole career which is great! I have heard all of these songs before except for 2 so I knew what I was getting but it is still good!"
5,Astonishing.I am amazed/wordless.,"My brother gave me this cd as a gift from his recent trip to Florida, as he already knows Im an avant garde modern listener.I was actually trying to avoid listening to it, but I hold just for a while , this is the sound of the future.This is disturbed mind healing, may God bless Richard James.Deep emotional music.Maybe only compared to Pink Floyd, Sigur Rós and Mogwai."
2,BUYER BEWARE: Don't buy until you know what you are getting.,"Amazon's product description is very misleading. Although the description indicates that this is a CD/DVD Burner & Printer, it is a PRINER ONLY. The full-featured version of this product is $1100 more. In Amazon's defense, they probably have not physicly reviewed the product, and the manufacturer's website and those of other vendors are similarly misleading."
1,DONE WITH PANASONIC!!!,"I paid $300.00 for this when it first came out. The dvd part is fine, but the vhs part stinks. Wouldn't accept half my tapes (lighter tapes). Would put the tape in, would spit it back out for no reason. Tried all different types, came to realize it wouldn't accept light tapes, such as children's videos, shorter movies, etc. And if the tape wasn't rewound, forget it. My fault on not bringing it back in after buying it (did it from day one). But when you spend that kind of money for something brand new, it should work perfect and it should last a long time. Now the vcr part is completely broken. Nothing but problems with my panasonic phone too. I do not recommend buying this brand, until they can fix all their problems with their electronics. I know I won't be buying their products anymore, because every panasonic item I have owned has had to be replaced."
2,Incompatibilty Problem,"Okay, this is a nice unit in most aspects. It works great in the areas people have mentioned...BUTIt does not display time elapsed on the display during DVD play, all it says is ...PLAY. Not huge but annoying. Chapter indication at least would be nice.Worst of all, this deck is very dicey about playing home-burned DVD's. Most of my -R's work fine but only one of the dual layer disks I burned work on this machine. They work perfectly on a Toshiba DVD player in another room. I consider this a major problem and had I discovered it soon after I bought it I'd have returned the unit.It also hasn't been very good at playing RW DVD's but that doesn't surprise me."
1,Stay away!,"This worked fine for about a year. Then it stopped delivering a video signal for both the DVD and VCR. You can hear the audio of whatever you're playing, but all you can see on the screen is the logo for the player. It's not worth the $75 repair fee because refurb'd units are now selling for $70. Stay away from this one. It's not worth it."
1,DVD Stopped working,"The DVD portion stopped working... I've had a Sony and now a panasonic, both DVDs died in less than two years, with the Panasonic dying in 5 days past the warranty period, figures!I have a cheap APEX, I think I piad $40 two years back and it still works!I use Panasonic phones and tv. I'm done with their DVD players."
4,Enjoyable Book.,"New Lease On Love is a good book and even involves an adventure in a hot air balloon and has likeable characters a guy, Nick Tanner, and a lady, Chelsea Lawton."
2,good product for value,"This set has one good pot and one pan that can be used very often and it good quality also. the the bigger pan doesn't look that good its thickness also seems to be not 18/10. i have bought 18/10 grade steel from jcpenny before and even though this set is 18/10 steel as per its description. I think its not. the steel is thinner than i thought that makes food stick in the bottom some times.but for its price its worth buying. i got it for even cheaper because i opened visa card with amazon. if you are buying as primary cooking utensils , i dont suggest but its good for add on."
2,They are not even non-sticky,"I have to say I overestimated their use before placing an order. Yes this set is astonishingly cheap, but I got my ""reward"" for opportunism."
4,not really,"this bug is too big to be hidden easily. and also after a couple of uses, even with new batteries, it just stopped working. when it did work, and was hidden somewhat visible, i had a great time with it."
4,Good Toy,I needed to figure it out first but then it realy worked. It is durable and fun. You may hear a fint beep but thats normal.Good toy.
3,Does Not Turn Off,The whole family had a great deal of fun with this toy. It seemed to work okay as a toy would. We have to unscrew the battery compartment and take the battery in and out everytime we use it because we cannot get it close all the way to turn it off.
1,disappointed,"My 8 yr old received this gift for his birthday, it worked for the first 10 minutes, then the listening device would not close, which meant it would not turn off, we had to remove the battery.My son was very frustrated and so were we."
4,Excellent starter,"In my opinion, this is one of the best starter book for raising a puppy, I wish I know about this book 3 months ago when we get our first ever puppy. I now know that we have spoiled the little guy and will need a much longer training to bring him back to true family pet.The reason it does not get a 5 stars is the book missing detail on some of the training technique or process. But overall, I recommand this to all new dog owners."
5,great starter book,this is a good book when you first get your puppy and i really like her techniques but i was looking for more tricks.
5,Great!,Great little button for all Coheed and Cambria fans! Item shipped on time and item was just as described! I
4,Free Your Mind,"The Danielson Famile provides perhaps the most innovative, unique approach to song-writing and execution in the last 20 years. With the fervor of the Oblivans, they run head-first into songs without the pretense of production or market appeal.Make no mistake, this is religious music in the truest sense.While ""A Prayer..."" is the least refined of their recordings, it doesn't lack what makes their music infectious and joyful.Listen once... then promise to listen 10 more times before giving up on them."
5,This is a great Item and supplier,This is a great item for a staff member who need a ergonomic keyboard to make his job easier. Supplies was great to work with.
3,Ok product.,"Nice that this is battery operated. It does takes twice as long to use, than other products of it kind. Does not cut the best. Was happy to have it while fly fishing in the rocky mountains."
3,not bad at all,quite a good piece. the nylon around the hilt and the sheath are rather flimsy but the main sword in particular is very well constructed. i recomend it to any sword collector.
1,Do fish sneeze?,"This article is fish food. One has to wonder if this reporting is true. Contrary to the usual image of journalists as cantankerous, obstinate, and ubiquitous in their search for truth and defense of justice, in their actual practice they defend the economic, social, and political agendas of the elite groups that dominate domestic society, the state, and the global order. This article systematically fails to provide the kind of information that people need to make sense of government security agencies.Calabresi was paid to change the subject and to frighten us instead of really exploring venality and corruption in government."
4,Sparkle,If you want to see were EnVogue got their moves from...definitely watch this movie. This is one of Irene Cara's best performance besides FAME.
3,Sparkle (1976) had a few dull spots.,"This was a pretty good movie, for 1976, I guess.I was glad that I was able to find it on amazon.com to watch on my Roku box.I was also glad that I didn't pay more for it.It pales in comparison to the 2012 remake--if only for the gaps in the storyline that are filled.I'm not saying it's a bad movie, just that the remake was better."
4,Sparkle,"For me, the original Sparkle was more enjoyable than the new Sparkle, the first version had more of a story, most of the people viewing the movie with me had the same opinion."
4,An Original that Never Gets Old,"I purchased the original Sparkle because I wanted to see it before the new Sparkle hit the movies. I thoroughly enjoyed both and I'm really glad that I saw the original first. Both were great, but the new Sparkle was phenomenal. They did an excellent job modernizing the story without loosing the original's glory."
1,Really Bad,"The packaging was Ok. The movie stops and goes,,mutters! The words dont match,,its like trying to watch an old Kong Foo movie..how do I return it fast! My advice, DONT BUY IT!"
5,LOVE IT,"I WAS GLAD TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THIS MOVIE, NOW I HAVE BOTH THE ORIGINAL AND THE ONE THAT HAS JUST RECENTLY COME OUT."
4,I didn't know...,"I don't know how I missed it...! I LOVE old black films; however, I didn't know about the original Sparkle! I enjoyed the 2012 version, but didn't know there was one before until a friend mentioned that I needed to see the original. ""WHAT ORIGINAL...????"" I looked it up on Amazon and had to have it. I enjoyed the movie and I think you will too."
5,QUESTION!,"Is this a DVD or a VHS? I loved the second Sparkle but I've never seen the first one so before I buy it, I want to know if it's in DVD format because I've seen comments that say that it's VHS. Thank-you. :)"
3,Sparkle,It was a good price. I thought it was the new movie but I was wrong. But that is okay. Still worth the price I paid
5,so good,This movie is a classic and great. So happy that they made it for dvd finally. It's wonderful.Would recommend.
2,Interesting Story - NOT PG,"The story was bittersweet, the singing was good but this is not family entertainment. I would not recommend - I thought there was too much negativity and immorality to be redeemed by a ""happy ending."" Lots of sex, drugs and some cursing...the PG rating needs to go up."
4,How I got my name!!!!!!!,This is a classic!!!!! I must say that I'm a little bias because I'm named after the title character. Too bad I can't sing like her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Good to see once...,"The movie is worth seeing, but not necessarily worth buying. It is a classic ""moving up"" story about three sisters and their two boyfriends trying to make it big. It is sad and happy, but they end it too soon and it doesn't break away from the obvious and predictable."
2,The singing is awful....acting medicocre,"Really? Why all the rave reviews? Much of the singing (more like lip singing) was awful. Pitchy, off-key, lame choreography. It's a movie you would catch a glimpes of while channel surfing, watch a minute or two, then change the channel. This is a pass."
1,THIS IS NOT THE 2 DISC SET!!!,"This is NOT the version with the 2 Disc seteven though the ad says it is, trust me it's NOT. There is NO second disc with Aretha Franklin. If that is what you are looking for do NOT buy this. I unfortunately did and I'm VERY disappointed!!"
3,Sparkle,Have no problem with the order and getting the DVD movie.The cost was reasonable Like the movie all right.
5,SPARKLE--THE DVD,This is my favorite movie of all time. Let's try to get it in DVD. Please click on http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and Let's tell Warner that we want the DVD! I even hear Beyonce loves this movie so use her name--it might be enough to get us want we want--the DVD! We want the DVD! We want the DVD!
5,Sparkle,"I Really Loved This Movie, I Must Have Watched It About Fifty Times, And Everytime It Makes Me Want To See It Again. Please Can Somebody Put This Movie On DVD."
3,Comparsion,"I never saw this movie, so after the most recent one I had to go back and compare the older one. It too arrived in a timely fashion, the package was undamaged....This is the one case in which the newer version is better than the older one!!!"
2,Not worth the money.,Not the same as the orginal movie. The actors did not playthe roll to real movie standards. Suggest we won't remake this movie.
4,Thee Original,One of the greatest kept secrets. This movie of course is getting better recognized for its more recent version. But this version is still best.
3,"Whitney, you gave a horrilbe performance...But still miss you","all i have to say about this movie,, it was kind of weak. Don't know if iwant to buy it or not."
3,Sparkle Dated Film,"Dated, problems with video, picture fuzzy, several breaks in movie due to connect problems. Surprized that a second version made of this movie."
2,Disappointed with this order,"DVD/CD COMBO PACK - The description stated that I would get the DVD movie and the CD soundtrack together. I only received the DVD. I did not receive the CD, that was suppose to be in the case with the DVD."
5,Great Movie,Although there is a new movie out with the same name. The new one is only loosely based on this one. Great original.
3,Sparkle,It was okay because it was old movie it was a little dark. Very good message story line . I will order other more up to date movies and music
2,Sparkle was unmemorable,"I was disappointed with this movie. It certainly showed the seedier side of trying to make the ""big time"" in early rock and roll, however the performances were unconvincing and rather shallow. The music was repetitive; I would have liked shorter versions and different songs. Irene Cara was probably the best actor of the lot and even she struggled with the material. Two weeks after viewing the movie, I am left with a vague impression of the story-line. So, in essence, forgettable and not worth buying."
1,WORST MOVIE STICK WITH DREAMGIRLS!!!!,"I just bought this movie and was excited to see it, and by the time it ended (which was very abruptly) I was mad and highly dissapointed. I couldn't believe how God-awful this movie was. I'm thinking that it's about ""Sister"" who is the lead singer and it's not, I found out that ""Sparkle"" isn't the group's name, but it's one of the singer's name, not only that but they hardly showed the character ""Sparkle"" until after her sister died, and after that you get maybe 30 minutes of her before the movie ends. It's terrible. They only showed some of her fame which was maybe 10-15 minutes long. If you LOVE high energy classy, sassy, sex appeal, glitz and glam of show business stick with Dreamgirls, if you love drama and backstabbing manager of show business stick with Dreamgirls, if you love beautiful voices, stick with Dreamgirls, if you want to waste time and think you have it bad, watch ""Sparkle."""
3,something missing,hi the ad for the dvd of sparkle said movie on 1 disc ans a short cd soundtrack with aretha franklin singing the songs on another i received the movie but no cd i reread the ad and it says cd so im confused please help me understand thanks bogieme2@aol.com
2,Piano,"This movie is not as good as the new Whitney Houston ""Sparkle"" movie. The story is better told in the new Whitney one and also the music."
4,better than the new one,It was better than the new one. I would have given a higher rating if it was in high def.
3,Too dark viewing,"I love the movie Sparkle. I am glad I had seen it years ago because the quality of the playback on my Roku device on a 37"" TV was poor. It was too dark."
4,Sparkle w/Irene Cara,I've seen the older version of this movie with Irene Cara several times and loved it. I decided to buy the older version after seeing the new Sparkle movie with Jordon Sparks.
2,"Don't waste your money on this older version of ""Sparkle""","After having seen the 2012 version with Whitney Houston and Jordin Sparks...who both did an AMAZING job...I was curious about this older version of the story. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. This story is poorly told and the editing was done extremely poorly. To be honest, after watching this movie, I had a hard time piecing together what I had just seen."
4,At the show,"I was pleased with the DVD, but disappointed that there were no behind-the or deleted scenes included in the special features. It is still one of my all time favorites."
4,Sparkle,"The ""original"" Sparkle! Wow! What a movie. The music is simply fantastic. The overall theme of the movie was great. The actors portrayed their characters extremely well. I'd recommend seeing the original before seeing the remake. I loved it! It was thought-provoking and touching."
3,Good Saturday Afternoon Flick.,"Sparkle was a pretty good movie. Not for the acting, which was unspectacular, but for the amazing soundtrack which will keep you involved even as some of the acting and dialogue pushes you away.Particularly good was Lonetta McKee as the older sister gone bad. Typical movie fare, but done with the soundtrack, it wasn't so bad.I recommend this movie if you are relaxing on a Saturday Afternoon and want something to watch that isn't too dark or too funny. But at the same time, it would probably be best to just by the soundtrack."
5,DVD,"This movie is in the top 5 list of my all-time favorite movies. Why isn't this on DVD? Why do ""we"" have to wait extra long for our classic movies to be released on DVD."
1,Dissapointing,"I was more angry than dissapointed when my favorite song played ""I finally found someone"". The songs are not sang by the original artists. I was looking forward to Barabara Streisand's voice. All the songs are being sang by who knows?. I dind't like they're voices and I was shocked to see that nowhere on the CD it tells you that."
3,Fairly good,"THese boots are good quality. I haven't worn much - just around town (busy wearing them in).However, please note, they are heavier than the similar boots with ""panama style"" sole. and These boots are thicker/higher profile.So i prefer the panama style soled boots to these 3-layer style boots - because the panama style are lighter and lower profile.But...these are still good quality boots, comfortable, and easy to wear. Very nice buy."
2,Too crinkly loud from the unlined tongue,"I really like the light brown Altama desert mil spec boot for hiking, and ordered a black boot for work. They fit just as well as the desert Altamas. The desert Altamas are quiet. The black jungle mil spec Altamas are very loud with a crinkly sound coming from the stiff tongue. Took a look at the desert Altamas and the inner part of the tongue, the part that contacts the sock has a soft lining with nylon mesh for the outer part of the tongue. On the black Altamas, they ditched the soft lining, making it just the nylon mesh, with no sound cushioning from the soft lining. The black Altamas are comfortable, but couldn't deal with the sound in a work environment so sent them back."
4,"This might catch from flak from all you ugly organists, but...","Honestly, I skipped over the Cursive tracks each and every time I listen to this ""split""; after splitting then regrouping sans Pedersen, I feel as though Cursive truly lost a sound that would then reemerge in Pederson's other groups after Cursive, the White Octave and Criteria. Cursive's energy feels sapped from the group and their effort on this split comes across rather ad hoc. Yet in Eastern Youth one feels an explosion of such beautiful energy, and the group truly brings to the listener what is lacking through the first-half of this split. Pick this up if only for the Eastern Youth portion."
3,a varied release,"Okay, all I have to say is that Cursive is only a rather okay (not spectacular) band compared to Eastern Youth who are like perpetual GODS of music to me. Although all of their lyrics are in Japanese, Yoshino and co. play... well just GREAT music. I'm not good at describing or criticizing music, so just check out this page for their independent label ..."
3,Works OK,"I like the Tamiya paints in that you can use alcohol as a solvent.A little trickier to use in a good paint gun than lacquer thinned paints; doesn't seem to stick as well once you get it thin enough to go through the gun. So finding the balance between sticky enough, and too thin is a little more difficult.This particular paint precipitates out the silver color into a tough to mix layer on the bottom of the jar; if you don't notice it you'll be paint BROWN."
3,It is ok but......,"It is ok...... but there is no deference in the electronics with the progression 6 or 7, sorry ltj I now you can do better.............. like in your tokyo cd"
1,Broken in an hour!,"This toy was not built for children to play with it. The back-hoe piece broke off within the first hour of my 2 1/2 year old playing with it and he isn't any tougher on toys than any other kid. I was very disappointed. We tried several times to fix it, but it was so poorly built that it repeatedly broke. Unfortunately, it was a gift and the gift-giver was very disappointed to see how fast it broke."
2,Breaks easily,I got this toy for my son. He loves it but it is not built well at all. the arm scoop keeps falling off he got it today and I have had to put the arm back on atleast 6 times already. Get muck instead.
3,Poorly made but my son loves it,"My 2 1/2 year old got this as a christmas present. It is one of his favorites, but the scoop arm keeps falling off. The tree thing uses magnets to be held in the bulldozer part, but they seem to have broken loose within the piece, so they don;t stay in the loader part. The tree also broke into two pieces. I have to admit I didn't see what the tree looked like until I got here, so maybe they aren't supposed to go in the loader, but since they fit perfectly, I'm guessing they do. He loves it, but I'm sad it's so poorly made."
