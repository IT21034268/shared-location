2,Ape Lover - literally,"I love apes, simply love them - I love their ample heaving chests, peircing blue green eyes, and scat throwing ability. With this in mind I bought the shirt, unbeknownst to me this is really an iron on tattoo of some sort. I cannot take the shirt off, woman find me extraordinary and approach me often - here's the downside every time a woman approaches I can't resist the urge to throw scat at them. I rate this shirt a number 2.Pro - womanCon - Scat"
2,More Work than it is Worth,"I was so excited to buy this product and prevent my eyes from tearing when chopping onions.However, I found the product not to be that useful. The width often does not fit my onions, the blades are not that sharp to cut through the layers of onions (don't even bother to try it on basil), and it is sooooo hard to clean. How do you get bits of onion off the blades that are sharp and retract into the base of the Zyliss?I recommend a knife or a mini-cuisinart instead."
4,"A for utility, C+ for durability","This was my favorite kitchen gadget when I got it. I used it almost every day. It is terrific for chopping small quantities of things like onions, garlic, carrots, and celery. It doesn't work so well for soft or leafy things (like herbs). It's a little tricky to clean, but I found it more than worth the effort. Unfortunately, it broke after about a year and a half. I tried another brand which mashed (rather than chopped) and broke within 3 months.Despite its fairly short life-span, I will probably buy another one. I found my first useful enough that it's worth replacing (even if I end up having to replace it every few years)."
2,Are you sure this is a quality product?,The one I had was basically the same as this one. We had the plastic blade guard replaced because it would crack horizontally and the tabs that lock it into place would brake off. I found it hard to clean between the blades. Also the blades bent. I have seen a different model where the center opens to make cleaning easier. I would suggest that model over this one. It definitely did not live up to the Zylis reputation.
4,You get what you pay for,"I was looking for an inexpensive chopper to chop nuts (mostly walnuts). I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and looked at some other choppers that were even less expensive than this one. However, when I looked at them (I forget the name brands), the quality was quite obviously poorer. So I decided to try this one out.I think that it's good for the price. It chops Walnuts quite well. Yes, the cup is small, but you don't have to use the cup. You can use this chopper directly on a cutting board.I did try cutting onions and it didn't do a great job. Wasn't so bad, but the pieces were quite uneven (some large pieces had to be cut up again) and the smaller pieces would get stuck in the blades.But for the price, I wasn't expecting much, and I got what I expected! I'm happy that it chops nuts well and so I'm not returning it. For me, it was overall a good buy."
3,Dishwasher Safe,The chopper is easy to use and well made. But they need to come up with a material that's dishwasher safe.
2,"Spendy; works ""OK"".","Just today, I saw something very similar on TV. They are selling them 2 for $... and that includes 2 flexible, counter protectors. It's an ""OK"" chopper...cleans up easily, but at the Amazon price, a bit spendy ($...)."
3,Almost made it,This product was wonderful for just a short time during holiday baking for chopping nuts but the plastic container soon cracked. I would like to get a replacement part rather than a new one.
1,HMV/Amazon get on the ball!!!!,"well i just went through the same thing where i ordered this dvd and waited and waited and waited and was then told that ""we can no longer get this item"". i emailed amazon to tell them that they should remove it and it's still listed as available. guys it is ""out of stock""!!!"
1,Pre-Order?,"The same thing happened to me last November. I ordered through Amazon.ca because two other sites (Amazon.com and Chapters.ca) said the DVD wouldn't be released until January 2010 - at the time, I thought it was just a typo. Now Chapters says you can pre-order it...six years in advance, apparently."
4,some scary sharks,these are some nasty great white sharks. oh my gosh everyone in the movie was getting eaten so fast without a chance to swim away to safety. this is a great shark movie. buy this if you liked jaws or are a shark lover.
3,SHARK BUFFET,"This movie certainly gave the sharks plenty to eat. While an out and out B movie, SHARK ZONE manages to scare up a few thrills and Dean Cochran is a pleasant, sensitively masculine hero. One big problem however is this: why would a Spanish ship be in the Pacific ocean? Would they have been sailing that way to get to the new world? Hmmm..no one seemed to question this very large plot hole.Oh, well, one shouldn't expect Oscar caliber features from Nu Image, who obviously used footage from other shark movies, and was filmed in Bulgaria. But I enjoyed myself while watching the film, since I didn't have high expectations anyway.Diverting if derivative."
1,good for a laugh,its just really bad. the shark attack series is low budget but their much better flicks. speaking of shark attack. shark zone has the same exact scenes as in shark attack 2. and they are replayed over and over again. who ever made this movie probly taped off the discovery channel and shark attack 2 and reused the clips over and over again. at least thats what it seems like. go for something else
2,Interesting Adventure Poorly Done,"This is another straight-to-video shark attack horror movie, with the same lame acting and poor special effects you would expect from a movie with a low budget. They do attempt to do a few things differently, such as having a school of sharks, as opposed to one shark. There is also a subplot involving the Russian Mafia searching for diamonds on a sunken pirate ship which I found to be pretty well-done. If you can get past the stiff acting by some of the stars and sit back to enjoy the movie, you might enjoy it. However, with no extras, it's hardly worth the cost to purchase it. I'd recommend rental instead."
1,Jaws Wannabe,"The movie was pretty awful especially as far as acting is concerned. I don't think it would have helped even if they put famous actors in it. They used the same scenes over and over again for each attack and you saw the same seagull several times...It looked extremely fake...visual effects were terrible....just plain awful, don't waste your money renting, wait until it comes out on cable."
4,Hilarious!!,"This movie was soooooo funny!!! OMG I was laughing like the whole time! I love shark movies especially the really bad graphics! This wasn't nearly as good as the Jaws movies, but at least it has a plot! It's better than Shark Hunter thats for sure...."
5,JURASSIC SHARK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"deffinetly bloody,this movie is really packed with carnage shark zone is also great with the sharks,the sharks are footage and rubbery,my kind of movie.if you're looking for bloody shark movies this is for you.that is why i gave it five stars,i recommend thos movie for all you shark lovers.and another reason i like it because the great white has survived for 100 million years!deffinetly jurassic shark,any way rent it or buy it either way you will love shark zone."
2,Pretty Bad,"Another movie using actresses seemingly straight out of soft porn. It's fun to watch them die onscreen sure, but it's redundant. I'm not surprised to read it's by the Shark Attack people. They're terrible too, but of course if they make a #4, I will rent it knowing it will be stupid. <sigh>"
2,Another lame Shark Movie,"Bad acting and bad effects make this movie awful.This movie was a little intresting,but could have been WAY WAY better.They coppied the same scenes from Shark Attack 2 and showed them over and over.When lots of great white sharks are killing tons of people at a beach resort ,its up to Wagner to kill them.It got pretty borring and made me want to go to sleep.Im warning you,do not see this movie!"
5,Essential reading,"This book was given to me many years ago by a dear friend. I did not, nor do I, have cancer but rather other health issues. At first I was reluctant to read it thinking it would not be applicable for my situation. I was definately wrong. This is one of the best books I have ever read. As such, I have given this book to many people over the years who are suffering from cancer amongst other illnesses. This is a MUST READ!"
1,Not your fault!,"When I was diagnosed with Non Hodgkins Lymphoma, I read a wide variety of ""inspirational"" cancer survivor books. The Bloch's Foundation's ""Fighting Cancer"" (free just contact them) and Norman Cousin's ""Anatomy of an Illness"" really resonated for me, made sense and reinforced my focus. Bernie Siegel's books on the other hand made me feel that the disease was my fault for having the ""wrong"" personality and that if I allowed any negative thoughts into my mind, I was putting my recovery in doubt. Heck most of my thoughts during treatment were negative, real negative! I literally threw his books in the trash, probably more of a symbolic gesture, but it felt good. BTW I am cancer free for the last 16 years, fathered a child and getting a kick out every day."
5,Gave me a new look on life after quadruple by-pass surgery,"One of the most uplifting books I have ever read.Gave me a whole new outlook on life. I Have a cousin who is termenially ill with cancer, I bought him the book also. It to gave him a different look on life."
5,For 20 years it has been the gift of love to those I care about,"I have given this book to friends and families for over 20 years when I was at a loss as to what to say, do, or give to express my empathy for their road ahead. This book has great ""mojo"" and gives credence to ""miracles"" do happen as every person I've given this book to is still here to give it to others facing the same challenges. I'm writing this as I'm ordering it for the adult son of someone who has been given 6 months to live---they have their issues (don't we all with our fathers?) and I sincerely hope Dr. Siegel's words will bring comfort to him and his wife during his father's process of leaving this life for the next."
4,A must read for persons living with cancer,"A brilliant read for any person living with cancer. It is also a highly recommended read for family members frustrated by the lack of compassion with which oncologolists treat their patients. It accurately protrays the arrogance with which the majority of oncologists deal with their patients and the sense of hopelessness they instill in their patients through their attitude and fixation with treating patients as statistics, playing God and placing a timeframe on their time left on earth.This book should be a must read for oncologists before qualifying."
4,"Four Stars, Not Five--Here's Why:","I'm a Hodgkin's patient who's almost finished reading this book. I found it to be an easy, quick read that felt good since it validated everything I feel about illness and life in general already. My guess is most of the reviewers who gave this book five stars are the same.However, I have to agree with the two spotlighted reviewers and not give this book five stars. We're not all born with the same ""toolbox"" and turning a negative, passive personality into the positive, proactive one that Dr. Siegel claims is necessary to overcome disease doesn't happen very quickly (if at all) . . . it takes years, and a lot more resources than just this book."
4,Nice,The pendant is very pretty and is reasonable for that price.However I think the chain is too thin for the pendant.
3,A very good book advertised to a limited audience.,"A Tzaddik in Our Times is a biography of of a man that few people outside the Jewish world would know about. This is an absolute travesty, because this man's life should be an inspiration to everyone, regardless of religious affiliation. These days, heroes are hard to come by, and role models seem to have died off with the last generation. Reb Aryeh is that hero, that role model, and his life is not just an interesting story. It is a guide to anyone who would lead a meaningful life, a roadmap to the soul."
5,This remarkable work should be known far more than it is,"This is a remarkable story of a remarkable person. Aryeh Levin was a very humble, and righteous person, one who dedicated his life to helping others. He was a legend in the Jerusalem of his time, a faithful student of the great first Chief Rabbi of Israel Rabbi Abraham Yitzhak Ha- Kohen Kook. He was also a legend for his help to the Jewish prisoners who the British held at the time of the Mandate. Above all he was known for his remarkable kindness to every person he met. He was truly a person who fulfilled the Biblical injunction of the prophet Micah, who ' loved justice, did mercy and walked humbly with his G-d""This book is filled with wonderful stories about him, and is recommended to anyone who wishes to be inspired and learn from this tsaddik ( righteous man) in our time."
5,The Wide Blue Road,"Best known for the recently restored ""Battle of Algiers"", ""Road"", director Pontecorvo's first feature, remains a stunning achievement. In this lyrical depiction of life's ambiguities, we feel no contempt for Montand's character, though he goes against the greater good by breaking the law: We simply see a man trapped in humble circumstances who breaks the rules to create a better life for his family. ""The Wide Blue Road"" is made indelible by its rich color cinematography and a nuanced, charismatic performance by Montand, one of the finest of his career."
2,"Sounds good, but...","I'm ,always convinced I'm going to grate my knuckles into the cheddar (although I never have) and the fear of it prompted me to buy this. But the truth is that it doesn't really do such a good job. You have to cut the cheese into quite small blocks to fit into the machine, and I found it tended to clog up. It's also a menace to clean. In the end, I put it away and went back to my old (traditional) grater which does a perfectly good job. And I still haven't lost any skin to it..."
2,Avg Cheese Grater,"Several years ago we purchased this grater from an in home kitchen show and found that it wouldn't grate a lot of cheese at a time. Later we bought a larger grater from a different company at a similar show and were much more impressed with the amount of cheese we could grate at one time. However, I must say that I prefer this style of grater w/it's european design because my knuckles aren't in jeopardy of getting shredded."
2,This grater isn't great.,"Granted, this grater is advertised as a grater for hard cheese, nuts, and chocolate, but it didn't specify only cold chocolate! Trying to grate room temperature chocolate in this utensil only results in globs that have to be pushed through.And, wouldn't one think most nuts are hard? Not so. Walnuts are smashed rather than grated as are Macadamia nuts,After the fiascos with chocolate and nuts we didn't even try for the cheese!"
4,Soft cheese need not apply...,"This tool is well-designed and handles comfortably, grating fine swirls of cheese with a quick crank of the handle. Note that this item works well ONLY with hard items like Parmesan and other European hard cheeses, but not with the cheeses commonly found in supermarkets, which have been processed to the point of being like rubber (including US-made Swiss, Edam, Cheddar etc.) These softer cheeses choke up the grate barrel and become glued to the internal structure, making it increasingly difficult to dispense cheese and impossible to clean."
3,All the Prayers of the Bible,"It is good, but would be a more useful tool if the prayers were ""topically"" indexed so you could find a biblical prayer under a specific need you might be going through at the time."
5,Great Reference Book,This was purchased for our adult fellowship groups to help them pray biblical prayers. It's a great reference tool for anyone who wishes to pray biblically.
5,warm and kind,"I work in the area of Alzheimer's research and have often been asked to help family members with caregiving ideas. I will wholeheartedly recommend this book as it is written with amazing compassion and warmth. In fact, you don't have to be a person caring for someone with dementia. The lessons in this book are valuable for everyone (D-don't argue; A-accept; N-nurture yourself; C-create novel solutions; E-enjoy the moment). However when dealing with a dementia, these reminders are even more important."
1,This has no smell...,"I do not recommend this product at all. There is no scent to it, so it's just a waste of space (and money)."
2,Smells great.....up close,"I expected more scent from this thing, and I have had it in my car for 2 months, and I can barely smell this thing. And now the oil or something at the bottom is changing colors... like it's dirty. It was a waste of money!"
5,The BEST/needs to be on DVD,I STRONGLE agree that this has to made available on DVD. My VHS tape of this is deteriorated and I am sick about it. I am not interested in another VHS version. If this were in DVD format I would definitely get it right away. It is my favorite version of all of them.
5,About the dvd ( hope this helps),"title: Super Mario Bros. "" King Koopa Katastrophe""features: The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3episodes include:- REPTILES IN THE ROSE GARDEN- SNEAKY LYING CHEATING GIANT NINJA KOOPAS- THE BEAUTY OF KOOTIE- TODDLER TERRORS OF TIME TRAVEL- REIGN STORMAND- NEVER KOOP A KOOPAPLUS A BONUS EPISODE OF "" SONIC UNDERGROUND""This dvd is great for those who want to get thier hands on some of the old episodes from this show since they are so rare. Most of these episodes for the exception of NEVER KOOP A KOOPA have never been released previously. This was a nice treat."
1,smb,"when i purchased this, i thought it was something else. i made my 3 year old watch it, and that was it."
3,AN AVERAGE CARTOON,"This dvd contains 6 episodes of super mario bros3 cartoon.The animation look more like a videogame than a cartoon.Although its nice it still remain second best to the original super mario cartoon but if you like it,then buy it"
1,Some movies just don't make you care.,"I cannot understand why this movie has so many positive reviews. My partner and I bought this for a discounted price mostly because we love Jennifer C. But on watching this.....there were times where I burst out laughing so hard at the movie that we had to pause it! And not because it was funny.....because I just wish the guys at MST3K could get a hold of it. Horrible acting, boring and odd dialogue and a very boring story line. It felt like an overdrawn episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" but without the cool music."
1,You Have Got To Be Kidding Me,I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It is so bad that it's funny.
4,Awaken....,Beautiful film. Billy Crudup gives a performance of his carrer. Connelly is great to watch and strong. Well played film. Don't blink or you'll miss Ed Harris appear on a TV screen. The movie tuggs at heart strings. Not the best but great. Not too original but is satisfying. Song at the ends along with Crudup is reason enough to watch.
3,It WAS terribly depressing...,"I have to agree that the presentation of this film ... the direction, the acting, and the cinematographic presentation of emotion and mood ... were high quality. BUT, the movie was a true wrist-slasher despite the effort it makes in the last lines to deliver some impression of hope. There are two kinds of sad stories: one that gives the viewers the cathartic release of tears ... and those that won't allow the viewer that catharsis. This is definitely the latter. No release, no closure, just a lingering aching loneliness one can't help but feel for the protagonist, Fielding.If you enjoy that kind of tale ... have at it. It elicits those emotions quite effectively through its odd plot and surreal style. The effect that the stories events have on Fielding are well-projected; I couldn't help empathizing with the mounting sorrow and madness that Fielding was obviously experiencing."
1,Haunting and really excellet,"I would ave given it 5 stars but Billy puts Ketchup on his hotdog. ""nobody, I mean know body puts Ketchup on a hot dog!"" -Dirty HarryThat aside 5 stars!Real authentic personalities on film. I hadnt seen this for a long time but just watched it again and it is really great. Full of longing and sadness and joy."
5,Best Film of the Year,"I am an avid movie-goer, and I am here to say that ""Waking the Dead"" was easily the best film this year. Billy Crudup as Fielding gives a beautifully honest portrayal, of a young politician trying to hold on to his beliefs and the beliefs of his deceased true love as he enters the ""machine."" The dialogue is pure literature, yet not beyond everyman. The cinematography is absolutely haunting. You must own this film. The DVD conatains 45 minutes of cut footage as well as a featurette. I have yet to watch the film with Keith Gordon's commentary. Warning: have kleenex or a dry sleeve available."
4,transcending romantic love,this movie deserves more play...powerful...can be seen as documenting the painful process of *transcending* personal/romantic love that all souls will have to go through before or after death...
4,Soundtrack help for Kristi,"I saw this film on Sundance earlier this summer, and absolutely loved it -- hope to pick up the DVD ASAP. To Kristi, the last reviewer, I don't remember which song was playing over the final credits, but it may have been a reprise of the pivotal song played towards the end of the movie -- check out Lori Carson's ""Snow Fall Down"" on her ""Everything I Touch Runs Wild"" CD. It's easily the best use of a song in a movie that I've seen in years."
5,"Wow, what a film...","I heard so many great things about this film, so I actually bought the DVD without ever seeing it. And man, did it blow me away. Wonderful performances from Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly along with a great script and superb directing make ""Waking the Dead"" a joyful, haunting film about lost love, sanity, politics, and doing what you can to stay alive and get what you want in the modern world."
5,The ultimate love,"I acknowledge the objectiveness that people can have to say that this story is not a love story. It addresses so many things that are not love, but they are all contingent on it. ""Waking the Dead"" is one of the greatest love stories I have ever seen, and I have seen many. I have never seen two actors, Crudup and Connelly, so entirely enveloped in each other. They played off of each pther amazingly. With respect to the story, I feel that it speaks of the kind of love that many of us can only dream. That one love that loves us despite our conflicting ideals, ideas, and desires. The final scene of the movie is probably what haunted me the most. Crudup pleading for reasons. Reasons for why his love had to leave him, and leave him the way she did. It also inspired me. It showed me that with the kind of love that they shared, life can go on."
4,where is your heart?,"I don't understand why some people (such as the reviewer that didn't like this movie) can't just allow themselves to feel the sincerity and beauty of films like this. They have to sit there and pick it apart, and completely miss the point of the film. Sure, there are plenty of bad films that are badly witten, directed, and acted(""Here On Earth,"" for an example). These bad films try in pathetic attempts to jerk some tears from the audience, while showing no sincerity, conviction, or real understanding of the human heart. Waking The Dead is NOT one of those films. It is one of the rare gems that you just have to open your heart and feel the powerful emotions expressed by the people that were involved in front of, and behind the camera. Any film could be picked apart if you try, but you'd have to be heartless and jaded to pick on a film like this."
3,"Brain dead, but artsy...",Yup... and the color and music owes its share from Disney`s Fantasia 1940...Some scenes compell and it really is like a wonderful gay dream.... But that`s all.... It`s like going through a wonderful book... so what I`m trying to suggest is that its virtues are mostly literate/and/or like a videocollage and not always cinematic...
1,Pointless gay movie,"This movie is a collection of ""erotic"" clips with no argument, no narrative, no taste nor point. Be warned about it. Although, chances are personally interested viewers (gay people) might find it enjoyable."
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed. Got as Christmas gift for 5 year old son. He loves monster trucks and has other videos. This one could not hold his attention. It spends most of it's time on boring commentary and interviews. Too much talking and not enough action.
2,Not what I expected..,"I found this boring and repetitive, poor quality. But to be fair I'm not a long time Monster Truck fan."
2,Slightly disappointed,"This set is somewhat ""outdated"". However my small grandson enjoyed the action. He wasn't aware of the actual timing of the events."
5,Great DVD set!,"Man, I had these tapes when they originally came out, I watched them all the time when I was a kid, these are the first 3 original Monster Truck shows, alot of history here, these were the real days of monster trucks, now I can watch them again, bottom line, GET THIS WHILE YOU CAN!"
4,"Perfect Size, Very Cuddly","My daughter was going through her dinosaur phase, so I purchased this for her as a Christmas gift. The size is perfect at 12in. for cuddling in bed or just carrying around and it's VERY soft. Softer than I thought it would be."
2,Not Important,"This isn't that important to have in your music collection, and chances are the only reason you are looking here is because this was Sully Erna's original band. Well here is the track list.1. Jingle My Bells. (Album Verson)2. O Tannenbaum (Sludge version)3. O Christmas Tree (Sludge Version)4. O Tannenbaum (Punk Version)5. O Christmas Tree (Punk Version)Well here's the thing. You are hearing the same Christmas and Tannenbaum songs twice, the only difference is that 2 and 3 are slower and 4 and 5 are faster. Technically they are all played very well, but at the end, I'm left with an ""Ok, what can I listen to next?"" kind of feeling. I'm left with an unsatisfied feeling, especially when I kind of hear the same song twice. Well one thing is for sure, this is a cool thing to play at a Christmas party or something. It will definitely take some people by surprise, but remember, this group broke up so taking a hard look at this band will lead nowhere. Well hoped this helped."
3,"Silver on the Tree, ages 9-11 or 11-14?","Silver on the Tree, written by Susan Cooper, has a wonderful amount of description to it.Although I enjoyed some of the books from the series, I must say that many others from the series seemed to have no value to read. My class of 21 students read this, and only about 2 people out of this class actually enjoyed this book. I myself can say I would not rate this book as 9-12, but 11-14 due to the way susan cooper will carry away from the excitement of the story with the description.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed these books, and hope to see more of the age group I think is appropriate will read it."
5,Worth reading again and again and again....,"I recieved this book as a gift many years ago and continue to enjoy it everytime I read it. Susan Cooper has what it takes to draw you into the book and make it seem like you are there. If I had to choose between her books and the works of J.R.R. Tolken, I would drive myself crazy trying to decide."
4,Definitely Bittersweet!,"The world gets saved from the Dark here, but there is a very heavy human cost to the victory. This is not surprising, since this is a series that takes myth and legend very seriously and does not sugar coat the battle between good and evil.One of the things that seems exquisitely sad to me is that the human characters who have been so heroic and important in this series not longer remember the epic battle they have been such a great part in when the story is over. While I understand this in the context of the story, it seems so very sad.I really loved this series of books."
3,"Predictable, and very slow in the middle","I almost didn't get through this book, because the not-very-exciting quest for the crystal sword in the middle of the book was so incredibly tedious. It was nice to bring all of the major characters together for the finale, but ""Silver on the Tree"" lacks any real feeling of suspense or even urgency. And the contrived nature of the way that the Dark will finally be defeated: whoever cuts the mystical mistletoe at precisely the right instant wins? So the Light has been getting ready for this for a thousand years, and it all comes down to a random moment's action? Everything happens exactly as you'd expect it to, the Drew children have almost nothing to do except show up, and there's way too much gratuitous Welsh. It feels a lot like Cooper was phoning this one in.If you've made it this far in the series, you might as well finish this last book so you can say you've read them all."
2,Good series goes bad,Sorry to say but the last book is terrible. I read The Grey King as a child and then read the entire series as an adult. The last book poorly conjures unimaginable images and overall the book is boring. The problem with the series in general is to elevate King Arthur to a mythological level when he is just a human.
4,"Silver on the Tree was really good, but I expected more","Everything in the Dark is Rising Series was really great, eapecially The Dark is Rising. Everything up to The Grey King built up tremendously. When I finally read Silver on the Tree I was somewhat disappointed. I was really happy the the major characters got together, but they weren't together long enough. I expected all five of the kids to do the journey together, and I also thought that the Drews didn't get to participate enough in the story, and Merriman was bearly in it! But I was really disappointed at the ending. I really didn't see the point of what all of them went through if only they were going to forget it in the end! It would have meant MORE to them and the story if they would have been able to remember. But all in all, the book was good. And I thank Susan Cooper for bringing us this excellent series."
4,Good,I bought this book for my younger brother. It is a perfectly fine read for those ten years and older.
1,outdated book,"research has shown stretching weakens muscles and does nothing to prevent or help speed up injury or recovery times. this book was made for kids, great if you want to teach them how to read, the information is awful though"
3,Not Anaglyph!,"I kept it because it was too inexpensive to bother with sending it back. The movie is both in 3D and 2D. I have no complaints with the movie itself but I am disappointed that it was sold as anaglyphic but is not. When the package was opened the enclosed leaflet stated that a 3D, I believe you call them shutter system was needed and available for purchase. I tried to watch it with my anaglyph (red/blue lens) glasses, just in case but the leaflet was inserted into the wrong product but no, it was not.Please change your description."
3,A Curiosity from the Corman Stable,"Filmed at Ardmore Studios, Ireland, DEMENTIA 13 is notable mostly for being the debut film of Francis Ford Coppola. A grisly tale of murder, greed, and the power of the past, it is most notable for the performance of Luan Anders as an avaricious wife determined to lay her hands on the family fortune. Unfortunately she comes to a sticky end, as she is hacked to death by an ax-murderer. The film focuses on the dead hand of the past, that comes to haunt most of the main characters cooped up in the dusty corridors of Halloran Hall. Patrick Magee plays a sinister doctor, who finally understands the family's guilty secrets. The film is only 72 minutes long, and packs in a fair share of gory moments. Worth a look."
4,"Not so subtle, but sticks with you!","I remember seeing this film as a young child, and the murders stick in your mind. There's one scene on a lake that you'll hark back to when you wake up panting at 2am on a dark and stormy nite :) For today's youth it's probably too campy, and not enough blood and guts- if you're used to the Freddy movies- but it's a classic. As the main review said- it has a surprising amount of blood for the time period. I'd recommend it as an eclectic addition to a horror film library."
4,3.5 Stars!,"This film is rather poorly made, but for the 2nd slasher, it is pretty good. Don't know why nobody speaks about this film. The effects are pretty good, and There is gore. Buy or rent today, and remember watch it alone in the dark"
3,Solid Horror Entertainment,"This early horror effort by famed directed Francis Ford Coppola about an axe murderer stalking an Irish castle contained some pretty meaty violence for its day, but by todays standards, it is obviously very tame. That said, this film is more about atmosphere and style than gore, and if that's what your looking for, then you can't go much wrong with Demetia 13. Shame the killers identity is so easy to predict. A deserved classic of the genre, sadly this DVD doesn't do the film justice: the extras are skimpy and the the image is in full screen. Even worse, during the last 10 minutes, the screen would briefly break up and go all over the place. You thought they would have taken more care transferring a film like this to DVD, considering it's cult following. Even so, highly reccomended."
3,gory thriller,An all star cast reinforce a beutiful script and of course one of the best directors in the world....A gory but clever grotesque horror/thriller. Not the best movie Ive ever seen but by FAR not the worst.
1,Feature from the bottom of the barrel!,"Pathetic! Creature from the Haunted Sea is supposed to be funny-it's not. If it was supposed to be scary(i.e. Giant Gila Monster) it would be pretty funny! Instead of being a cheesy film that would be fun to watch and make fun of, it is a cheesy film that tries to make fun of other films and fails miserably to do so! Get it? Niether do I! I just hope that Dementia 13 is worth the cost of this tape because the only thing thing good about Creature From The Haunted Sea is there will be no Creature From The Haunted Sea 2!"
2,Just okay,"I only paid $0.50 for this copy and that's about what it's worth. I am not going to complain too much because I do have a copy for my collection. But, the picture is not very clear and the film skips, no joke. Also, the pictures on the back of the DVD do not match the movie, the pictures are in color and are not actual pictures of the movie. Only get this if you only want to pay $0.50 for it."
1,I suppose everyone has to start somewhere,"In light of his filmography, I don't think Coppola will lose any sleep over a little honesty here. In short, this is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever bought (and I own more than a handful). I bought for obvious reasons, and while I suppose it may be impressive as a first film, it lacks any other merits. I've only fallen asleep twice in my life watching a movie, and for this one I was sober."
1,Francis Ford Crapola,"Interesting only for being the director's first film. otherwise, objectively viewed, fit fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000. Illustrates the dangers of letting students make films, even gifted students."
3,"Decent, Not As Good As I'd Like It To Be Though","While this Blu-ray edition of Dementia 13 looks way better than any previously available version I've seen, it doesn't look any better than a well-made standard DVD release. The picture is quite soft looking, for the most part, with some pretty bad ghosting in many of the night-time scenes. It's hard to tell whether this is the result of a bad print or a substandard high-definition transfer, as the crispness of the image varies, sometimes within the same scene.For a while now, I'd been hoping that the negatives to this were safely tucked away in the Metro Goldwyn Mayer film vault, waiting to be released in it's full pristine glory. However, with this release, MGM will most likely be scared off (yet again) by it's competition, as was the case with the American International cuts of Mario Bava's Black Sunday and Black Sabbath (a real disappointment) and a handful of other public-domain Roger Corman productions."
3,Interesting but flawed,"This is certainly an achievement for a $20,000 budget, even in1963. And the direction is often striking, showing much promisefor Coppola's future but in no way anticipating the ""Godfather""epics. However, the original story by the director is prettyderivative and doesn't really go anywhere, and most of theacting is mediocre at best. I'd advise any horror fan to buy abudget dvd of this as it is a cult item, as well as any fan ofFrancis Ford Coppola. Just don't expect a whole lot and you willbe entertained for about 78 minutes.The print on the dvd is flat out lousy; audio dropouts andoften such poor visual quality as to annoy the viewer. But theprice is low and the film is worth adding to your collection."
1,Couldn't even use it,"When the psp fist came out, I bought a screen protector and it lasted for 6 years along with my original psp. Well, I ended up buying a new psp, and this screen protector. It came with one protector, and I could not put it on without getting bubbles. Not just one, but so many it was impossible to get it on. The first psp I bought, I had NO problems getting the screen on, and it was easy, and simple. This was clumsy, and impossible to put on. I just threw it away, because once you get it on, it's done. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
2,lots of bubbles,Placed it on my psp 3000 and could not get the bubbles out. Had to throw it away because it had too many bubbles.
4,Works for me,"Considering I paid less then a dollar including shipping I didn't expect anything amazing. It does increase the glare which is not to big a deal. I managed to get it on with few air bubbles but you really only get one attempt or it doesn't stick as well. Definitely will not leave any residue on your screen if you don't like it. As for protecting the screen it does its job perfectly so far. I have a psp 3000 and it covers about 97% of the screen. If you want an inexpensive protector this is not a bad one, just know its not going to be perfect."
4,Above Average Screen Protector,Nothing special in this one except the screen protector is a good bit thicker and more durable than the more common screen protectors you see.
3,screen flim,it got mailed to me quickly. but it was hard to put on. Also i'm not s good at putting that kind thing.
1,It's not a game. O.o,"First of all, I don't know why it's called a game in the review when it's not, so I gave both only one star because it didn't apply to the item. Second of all, I am very pleased with this product. I had a little trouble getting in on perfectly, but who doesn't? But after that, I am worry free about getting finger prints and scratchs all over my screen"
2,History or Practice ???,"My husband and I bought this book to help a friend with her ceremony. We were looking for practical advise with some historical context. We got history with some practical advise. Sorely disappointing, that's all. Otherwise it's good book, just not for planning a handfasting or wedding.Jess"
5,Anything By Kelly Howell Is Amazing,Love all Kelly Howell Cd's...they help me so much! You can't go wrong in purchasing her material and I highly recommend anything by her.
1,POOR PRODUCT!,"This product did not deliver it's function!, it produced a distorted picture in s-video mode. Seller doesn't cover return shipping cost & does not give an appropriate time frame for returns. I waisted my hard earned money! I purchased a SONY SBV40S for $50.00 & it works perfectly."
4,Interesting documentary!,"This documentary covers the boxing event of Ali Vs. Foreman. This even was huge because it is between two of the best boxing fighters in the world at that time. Mohammed Ali was the experienced one, however Foreman was the younger and faster one. Many people expected Foreman to win this fight.Even though this documentary is focused on one event in Ali's lifetime, however it explains to you why Ali is such a legend.It will teach you a lot on Ali's character and personal values, which contributed a lot to his legacy."
3,This left me for interested in George Forman than Ali,"I liked this if nothing else to see Ali, Foreman, James Brown, Don King and every black celebrity who was anybody young. I know the back story on this and there was so much material that the filmmaker was afraid to cut anything so just kept everything for nearly 30 years. I would have liked to see the entire fight but I really enjoyed it and have shown it to several people.I was actually more interested in George Foreman after this and would like to see another documentary focusing more on him. I had the good fortune to meet Mr. Foreman in Houston a few years ago and he was very charming and articulate. It's nice to NOT be disappointed in a celebrity athlete for once."
4,Gotta love it,This is one of the greatest documentarys of all time. It belongs in boxing history. That is pretty unique that the two fighters had to wait six weeks in Africa to fight eachother. Rumble in the jungle is in my top ten for the greatest boxing matches of all time. The director directed this one with determination. The dvd was more like a vhs though. That is the only flaw. Buy it and you will not be dissapointed. God bless you and God Bless America.
3,"Good, but should have examined the fight further.","'When We Were Kings' is a fantastic documentary about one of the most famous fights in boxing history; the epic battle between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, nicknamed ""Rumble in the Jungle"" in Zaire. Die-hard boxing fans may be disappointed though. The films studies the hype and preparation before the match. One big problem. It doesn't examine the actual fight in that much detail. It should have studied each round with depth and really explained how Foreman lost so abruptly."
3,"come to bongo congo, meet the hypesters & the hipsters ...","released more than 20 years after it was filmed, this documentary follows the 1974 heavyweight championship bout between muhammad ali and george foreman. staged in a circus atmosphere in the nation of zaire, the fight took on all sorts of political implications. whats obvious now is that it was replete with hype, on the part of ali, on the part of the zaire government, and mostly on the part of promoter don king. and the oblivious sad sack is foreman, who learned all about hype himself. the movie is probably too long, but i liked it."
4,"Great film, crap DVD","This DVD does NOT contain the entire film seen in the theaters. The Beatles scenes are entirely gone, and my favorite song from the movie is also missing, as it also is from the soundtrack. The DVD also has no special features at all.If you loved the movie, you have to buy it, but you don't have to be happy about it."
4,great background on Rumble in the Jungle 1974 event,"The thing that leaped out at me:1) BB King's singing and playing guitar in 1974 in Africa was at the top of his game.2) Norman Mailer's analysis and insight when interviewed 1974 is like a sample from his book, ""Fight"", which is now featured, in part, on Muhammad Ali's web site now.3) Ali seemed like a smartalec to me in 1974, but now in 2004 looking at the old footage of him talking, he seems charismatic and funny .If you want lots of Rumble in the Jungle fight footage, this is not the DVD for you, but if you want insight in to the event and what contributed to Ali's upset of Foreman, this is a must have."
5,Richly deserving of the Oscar it received,"I recall attending a closed circuit telecast of the Ali-Foreman fight in Miami in '74, and when ""The Greatest"" actually pulled it off - regaining his title after the enforced exile - most of the audience went nuts. Rarely have I been in an environment of such absolute joy. This first rate documentary of the ""Rumble In The Jungle"" makes me wish I had been in Zaire to experience that emotion ""live"". This is marvelous film making about one of the most complicated and extraordinary heroes of the twentieth century - and is clearly deserving of the Academy Award it received."
3,Foreman-Ali and Plimpton-Mailer,"Recollections of the 1974 George Foreman-Muhammad Ali heavyweight championship fight from George Plimpton and Norman Mailer provide the most interesting moments in the film WHEN WE WERE KINGS. The two famous writers were close enough (front row!) to the event but with no stake in the outcome, and their objective comments stand out. If you like WHEN WE WERE KINGS, look for a video entitled CHAMPIONS (or something like that), a group interview with Ali, Foreman, Joe Frazier and other prominent 1960s-70s heavyweight boxers. That video offers even more old clips and its storytelling is from the athletes' own memories, George Foreman's thoughts most compelling."
3,Rhino Logo Watch,"As this watch is a gift, I can only rate the excellent shipping service and comment on the appearence of the watch. It is as advertised, handsome watch."
2,not even close,Belt size is one of the most important things you can do to make a snowmobile run well or not. This thing is not even close to what the belt charts said it should be. Get it right or dont sell it.
2,Play the French: Review in Brief,"Pros:- Covers the mainlines in great depthCons:- Heavy on variations and light on explaining the ideas behind the moves- Very biased towards black. If you are looking for a good response to the French as white then don't bother with this book, as apparently there isn't one! (All mainlines end in at least equality for Black, according to Watson.)- Doesn't mention anything about the La Bourdonnais variation (1 e4 e6 2 f4). Not a mainline i know, but it seems strange to me that Watson doesn't even mention it. I have been experimenting with it and from my own games it seems like a decent try for white."
4,"Best repertoire on French, but I miss the Rubinstein variation.","The Rubinstein should have been included in this book, because 3.Nc3/Nd2 3..dxe4 will indeed reduce your workload when studying the French opening."
4,This book is a good way to pick up the French,"One problem that many of us face when playing the French against under 1800s is that our opponents don't play into main line Winawer or Tarrasch systems, but instead head into odd exchange, Labourdonnais, advance, and Qe2 systems. Watson offers solid lines against all the major/minor systems, and sharp yet solid lines in the Winawer and Tarrasch lines. The French is a fascinating,if demanding, opening--a dynamic sharp defense rather than either a passive response or a mere counterattack. If you've always thought it might be for you, John Watson's book will get you started."
1,Ultimate inaccuracies,"This book has great pictures and what appears to be good information, until you get to pages 80-81. The inaccuracies on these pages are blatant enough to make me question the accuracies of the whole book.The listing of the final year of the hemi in racing is wrong. They also show a picture of a ""429 ci Hemi"". The picture is of a ""wedge"" engine, not a hemi, and Chrysler did not make a 429 ci motor. It was 426 ci.The book would be good, if it was accurate."
4,Ripped from the pages of the Gulf War...,"Charles Jaco, former CNN reporter, has written a dynamite, fast-paced book which grabs a reader and puts them next to the title characters as they chase a chemical weapons conspiracy through Haiti and the Middle East. Once you pick up this book, you will be hard pressed to put it down!"
1,"Dead Air??? I say ""Dead Book""","I found myself dying to get through this book so I could move on to something else. The book was hard to follow and corny at best. The writing was so ho hum that I wasn't sure if the characters cared to ""save the world"" or not.Definitely pass on this book for the next bargain buy."
1,substance without style - Jaco should stick to reporting,"When most two-bit hacks write an adventure story, they write themselves as the dashing rogue, and live vicariously through their characters, submitting themselves to the intrigue and danger that they - in real life - have never faced. It's much the same for Jaco with ""Dead Air,"" except here it's the other way around. He's lived through the excitement and now he wants to try his hand at being an author. As a result, he ends up just as much a hack; in his case, the facts are there, but the writing's not. The characters come off as stilted stereotypes instead of breathing, passionate people. Next time, Mr. Jaco, snag a ghost writer and let him or her put your experiences into a more appealing story."
2,error in kindle version,"I am reviewing the kindle version of this product. I happen to also own the hard copy version of this book which is phenomenal and a must have. I purchased the kindle version of the book, which looks great at first but has one very simple but catastrophic error. --The answers for the cases precede the case images and case questions! (You can download the sample before you purchase to confirm this). The whole point of the case review series is to be able to take the cases as unknowns, the answers are revealed after your best efforts at reaching the most likely diagnosis. The reversed arrangement of the kindle version, where you see the answer first defeats that purpose, and makes it unusable. This is not a mistake on Amazon's part, its just how the publishers arranged it. If the arrangement is changed, then this will be an equally phenomenal purchase, in which case I will be first in line to buy it again."
5,service,Excellent.I am happy that I purchased the book and it was in great shape as it was promised.Ilike to have this book in my possesion.Thank you
5,As good as any thriller gets.,"My father bought this book off Amazon.co.uk and gave it to me to read on the plane when I recently went on holiday to Tenerife for a week.Well! I got so engrossed in it that the flight just seemed to 'fly' by!Please excuse the pun.I read quite a lot of romance as well as thriller books, and the one thing I look for is a well constructed storyline. Leslie J. Weddell has acheived this in Sleeping With Dragons, for it is a terrific read.There is suspense,action,thrills,fun,good descriptive dialogue and the author has skilfully blended them altogther to keep the reader wanting to see what happens on the next page.I really enjoyed 'Sleeping With Dragons' and think you will too."
2,Choppy and unfocused,"I was annoyed by the shortness of each chapter, with very little progress being made in each one. I have lived in Japan for 11 years. Kumiko doesnt seem Japanese (or half Japanese), she seems autistic. All descriptions of anything Japanese were mistaken, over done or just weird."
2,Too weird for my taste.,"The technoworld that Gibson creates is very sharp, very precise and very strange. What do all this people want and why? The cyberspace sequences are totally unreal. I finished the book without figuring out what the hell had happened"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Second girl cyberpunk mystery.Count Zero, or Bobby Newmark appears in this book, as does Molly, the Street Samurai, and the odd other bit player, as the Neuromancer 'trilogy' continues.A young girl that doesn't seem to quite belong in this society is of interest to many people, and Molly is a protector. She also happens to look somewhat like a famous actress, who becomes another important character, and has connections to the strange online voodoo worldSome more of the same from Gibson, but another good novel."
2,Needs to be on Kindle,Come on publisher. This novel needs to be available on the Kindle. I don't buy novels any more unless I can get them in Kindle format so I will not be starting this trilogy until I can get them all on the Kindle. How can you have 2 of the 3 available in digital format.
5,My favorite of the Sprawl novels,"Like other reviewers, I was happy to see Molly again-- can I be an over-thirty razorgirl? Even though all the books were great reads, somehow _Mona Lisa Overdrive_ managed to flow together with every click perfect. The other two were heartbreakingly close to perfect, but for me this one just did everything right. Excellent."
4,"Excellent conclusion to the ""Sprawl"" series","I enjoyed ""Mona Lisa Overdrive"" and ""Count Zero"" more than ""Neuromancer"" but the reason is that I read ""Neuromancer"" before ""Burning Chrome"" (Gibson's collection of short stories) and the other two after ""BC"". It makes a big difference because ""BC"" gives you a lot of necessary background. ""MLO"" is almost better than ""CZ"". The introduction of some new characters to go with the story of Angela Mitchell and The Count worked well, I thought. I liked the relationship bewteen Molly and Kumiko too. I think it's time I re-read ""Neuromancer"" to get a second perspective on it."
3,Picture this...,"I had never seen Count Zero in the stores, so I thought this one was the sequel to Neuromancer instead of the 3rd. I followed it okay, and enjoyed it too, but definitely felt like I was on the outside looking in, always playing catch up. So, read the first two first, then this one, and enjoy! Much more of this one takes place in the real world than Neuromancer, so I found it much easier to ""see"" what was going on. And since it's not so caught up in the gadgetry, the characters come through more fully."
5,Whata Watch!,If you get this watch you won't be disappointed. Retail stores are charging full price. Looks great in person and the blue is not as overwhelming as is pictured here. Had it for a week and have received a lot of complements. Awesome watch at a great price!
1,Where did the bible come from?,"Many self-described Bible Christians must believe that a leather-bond gilt edged English version of the bible fell from the sky and landed in the hands of King James. Since the Canon of the bible (The New Testament) was compiled by the Catholic Church, it's a Catholic publication. So to say that Catholics don't believe in the bible is akin to arguing that a mother doesn't believe in the existence of her own child. McCarthy, like Boettner, the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan is simply anti- Catholic. He takes half-truths and history out of context to support his own prejudices. Bible Christians lack the history, the physical presence during the time of Christ and the Tradition of the Catholic Church so they have to make up lies to denounce it. This book is a foundation for those lies."
1,When you want to know something....really know something...,"If you want to know about the Roman Catholic Church, ask a practicing Roman Catholic parishioner or a nun, seminarian, or Priest. If that is too uncomfortable, watch Catholic television (you know the channel) silently in your own home. Why not go to the source? A thorough, open, and truly objective inquiry would help to prevent the publishing of pamphlets and books filled with misconceptions and misunderstandings or at least offer a well-balanced, well informed document. I was baptized Catholic as a 2-day old baby, raised Evangelical Protestant and am now a devout practicing Catholic. I did not jump into the faith, but rather educated myself; asked questions, sought answers and I find these types of books so severely uninformed. This and other types of similar publications are propagandaism and rhetoric in the purest form."
1,Reliable but Invalid Measurement,The device appears to be highly reliable but the measurement is not calibrated properly and is invalid. I happen to know my PEF from two sources - another peak flow meter and a professional measurement provided by my allergist. They are similar and the difference between those values and what PIKO-1 provides is in the range of 50 liters/minute. This makes the devide entirely useless to me.
1,Regret I bought this,"This oximeter eats batteries. I can't even go 24 hours without changing batteries. If I take them out after everu use, and then reinstall them, I can get about 3 days from a set of batteries. The batteries care going to cost more than the meter in another week. Don't buy this one."
2,Did I actually pay money for this?,"I do have to give it to these guys that they sound like they are having fun, however most of the songs sound thrown together at best. If you are looking for something a little goofy that does not take itself too seriously, then this is for you."
1,Couldn't finish this one.,"Rarely do I not watch a movie to the end to at least give it a chance. This one was so bad I couldn't justify wasting my time. I did go to the scene selections and chose the final scene to see if maybe the end was okay. Not really. I am not sure what was in between, but I can't think of much that would interest me on this one. I guess I should have had an idea when I looked it up here on Amazon and see the lack of any description at all. I guess that's why I went ahead with this review. Maybe it will help someone who wonders about it too. I would venture a guess and say there is no description because there is not much to describe. Sometimes even the best ideas need work. Too bad this one was left ""in construction""."
5,Spirit from heaven,Very spiritually helpful and encouraging. Bring God closer to you and reduce the difficulties of lives.
3,"PETER BERG, OPUS 1","*** 1998. Written and directed by Peter Berg. A black comedy about how to avoid to be arrested for murder when you are about to get married. No morality here, just a good little movie with funny actors. The last scene is a little jewel of pure madness. Check it !"
3,Cute yet sweet but as was expected very funny.,"I enjoyed some of the off color humor others of it should be left to the imagination or better so the bedroom.The characters did an exceptional job of playing their parts an deserved an award, but more than likely that's out of the question. For those who like to laugh though,check it out an then come back an reveiw it your self. Don't just take my word."
1,There are advantages to watching this movie,"The best advantage to watching Very Bad Things is that every movie watched afterwards will look good by comparison. While watching it, I kept on wanting to push the FF button to see if I could find a good part. It wouldn't have mattered. Berg should have given the actors the dignity of wearing paper bags over their heads while being in this movie. In fact, they should do a gimmick movie out of this, remake it, using the exact same script (like the new Psycho), call it Very Bad Movie, and give out written apologies to everyone who buys a ticket, signed by the director."
1,Irresponsible,"I'm beginning to think that ""black comedy"" of the sort in this film can only be enjoyed by male adolescents. I also find it interested that nobody mentions the hidden racism and misogyny in this film. Am I missing something? I feel sick from watching this movie and Cameron Diaz is so utterly annoying. She really can't act."
1,Very bad movie.,"Very Bad Things is the worst supposed ""dark comedy"" ever! Geez the cast is annoying and the characters are so unsympathetic, and Cameron Diaz is compelety miscast, she derserved so much better. Christian Slater thinks he is the best actor that ever lived and just wanted to punch Daniel Stern's face, talk about a drama queen! And I am not sure which is worse, the crime the guys committed or the bizarre ending, what the hell was that about anyway? This film tries so hard to be edgy, unique, and funny but it just isn't. Do me a favor and stay clear from this mess, it's awful, ugh!"
2,"audio, video not matched",The movie arrived quickly and was in good condition. The problem is the audio is about a second behind the video. It appears to be a genuine dvd so it is a mystery why this is.
3,Very much a surprise!,"This black comedy took me 2 sittings to get through it, however I am glad that I did - it is SO sick that it is funny. The high testosterone level of the movie was irritating, ever for this male viewer, but heck - they were in DEEP and didn't really handle it all that well. Saying that, there were some classic scenes of weirdness that I have just never seen before, making it worth the price of admission.If you want something to shake you up and you are not upset by tasteless humor, this movie should be on your rental list. Diaz is great, and all the 'bachelors' in the party-gone-bad are pretty good when their time comes, some better than others... Slater was the big name, but he was just simply the scumbucket that all the others worked off of - and I enjoyed the 'other' performances a lot more.Give it a run through the VCR when this kind of urge hits ya..."
5,Only a 3 * average?...,"This movie is the funniest thing I have ever seen. See, some guy whacks (kills) a prostitute...Okay, grim start, but wait until you see everything they go through to try to cover it up!DO NOT let the kids watch it, it contains the sickest humor, blood, gore, sex, nudity, and they use 'the ""F-"" word' more than they say ""a, an"" or ""the"" combined, and kids wouldn't get why 99% of it is so funny anyway. But if you are 18+, this movie is so outrageously hilarious, you'll be laughing well after it's over."
1,What were they thinking???,All of those actors have such great reputations... How can they do this to themselves? I just got done watching the movie (we rented it) and I was so disgusted that I had to come straight here and warn the world
2,Dark comedy still needs to have comedy,"I love a dark comedy more than the next person, and laugh at things that I probably really shouldn't. So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley. Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, ""Very Bad Things"" simply fails as a comedy. And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic. That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them. I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times. You could do worse, but this is strictly a rental at best."
4,Very good things,"A lot of people might call this movie dumb, yet this is very different from your There's Something About Marys. The comedy is as black as you can get, and even though at times it is incredibly stupid, it's at the same time enjoyable. This is silly humour, but silly humour aimed at adults, unlike Farrelly Brothers movies and the like, where teenagers are the target. Oh, and it's VERY funny, but only if you have a twisted sense of humour. Some people will no doubt find it deeply offensive, but it's nothing more than a hilariously over the top movie with some wonderfully inventive scenes, including a human jigsaw puzzle (very funny...) Also, Christian Slater is fantastic in his role, and the direction is nice and fast, perfect for this type of film. It's nice to see a film that doesn't discriminate in its absolute hate for everything - it's not against women, black people or homosexuals. Just the human race. Brings a tear to the eye..."
2,and to think i was looking forward to this....,I have been looking forward to this movie for a while now. I missed it when it was in theatres and I just got the chance to rent it on video. Boy was I ever dissapointed. I usually like black comedies but this one just wasn't funny. Every character made me mad and I couldn't have cared less what happened to them. I'll admit this movie had its funny moments but there just weren't enough of them. This is definatly the blackest comedy (or maybe even movie) I've ever seen.
1,"Don't waste your time, money or health.","Don't waste your time or money baying this movie. It is not a Comedy, I didn't laugh seeing it. Violent films with no don't offend me, but this is nothing but random violence. This movie is truly very bad. the movie should be named ""Very Bad Movie"" ZERO STAR MOVIE"
5,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"This is my favorite dark comedy of them all. Up until Very Bad Things came out, Heathers used to be one of my favorite dark comedies. Very Bad Things beats it. I admit I'm a huge fanatic of this movie. I bought the poster, buying the DVD, but I want the soundtrack bad. Very Bad Things is a dark comedy for those to the extreme. If you liked Heathers, you'll probably like this one."
1,Very Bad Things is a Very Bad Movie,"The poster says ""If you didn't like There's Something About Mary, you'll hate Very Bad Things"". I did like There's Something About Mary, and I still hated Very Bad Things. This is without a doubt, THE worst movie I have ever seen (even worse than Van Damme's Streetfighter). Christian Slater was annoying in Robin Hood, brilliant in True Romance, and quite good in Broken Arrow and Hard Rain, but this is his worst performance ever! Cameron Diaz is a pathetic drip in this movie (who I think I was supposed to feel sorry for, but didn't). Doesn't give you anyone to go for, but gives you too many people to hate. Complete garbage!"
1,Words can't describe how bad it is!,"Some movies are bad because they weren't made very well. But very few movies are bad because they were designed to be this way. This is one of them. This movie is so bad. SO BAD. ... . The horror, the horror. Why, you ask? Well, the movie tells the story of several friends who go on a bachelor's party to Las Vegas. Then one of them accidentally kills the stripper they've invited... from this point things just get worse and worse... more and more innocents are being killed. It's a festival of misery, pain and death. I understand the term ""black comedy"", but this is certainly far, far from comedy. All I saw are bad things happening, people trying to cover it up, and then more bad things. When the movie was over I hated the characters so much.. Last, the movie was executed well. The actors play well. It was just *designed* to be bad on purpose... ... ."
1,Not just a clever title,"""Very Bad Things"" sums up the movie as a whole, in plot and in overall quality. Everyone is describing it as a ""dark comedy,"" a genre I really enjoy. I got the ""dark"" part but there was not one thing funny about this film. It's a sick, spiralling melodrama of truly shameful acts that didn't deserve my time to watch it. The filmakers and stars owe their audience an apology."
1,CRAZY,I DON'T HAVE ANY WORD TO EXPLAIN FOR IT. IT'S REALLY HATEFUL AND CRAZY. YOU BETTER STOP SELLING IT.
1,Pure Rot!,Absolutely one of the worst films ever made! I was so angry after being tricked into watching this film at a theater that I wanted to beat up the director and everyone else who took part in it! I wanted to yell at the theater manager and the parents of little children that were allowed to watch this so called piece of entertainment. It's not humor. It's sadistic and cruel to make actors and actresses take such parts. Like the innocent black man who comes to the door as an investigator and ends up getting cut to little pieces by a chain saw in a bathroom hotel. Imagine the auditions! I watch films to be entertained. This is bloody trash. I am concerned about reviewers who rated this film highly. It represents the lowest form of entertainment and portrays American film makers at their absolute worst.
2,I know it is a VERY BAD MOVIE,"Before clicking the link on this page for this film I knew that someone would say VERY BAD MOVIE, OR VERY BAD FILM, it is awful, but me and my friend use to laugh when we'd mention the title of this film and at the end when he's spinning around in a wheelchair. How can some of the best actors be in such a film, great cast, bad script, bad movie, it's stupid, and very violent, there are parts that are funny though like when Daniel Stern says ""Have you done this before""? when he knew what to do with the body. Yes it is awful, it really is. The darkest ""comedy"" ever, they went way too far. It's almost as sick as the movie FREEWAY another movie with great actors in such a terrible film. Atrocious films."
1,Very bad flick,"Writer/director Peter Berg's bio on the DVD states: ""Peter Berg is a member of a small, elite group of performers and filmmakers who are creating vehicles for their multiple talents"". It seems to logically follow that satisfied viewers must likewise be a member of a ""small, elite"" group of viewers who think that disgusting trash is an art form. As you can see from the huge number of negative reviews here at Amazon.com, most viewers of this movie were not part of that ""small, elite"" group. If you are not sure, your best bet is to rent before buying (and bring your barf bag)."
5,The title does NOT kid around.............,"First of all I, myself, loved the movie. On the other hand, it was the DARKEST of dark comedies. At one point I thought that it was a suspense/horror flick in a couple parts, and then found myself laughing out loud in others. All around, I thought it was VERY good, but, Be sure you have some aspirin to pop during the movie because the suspense gave me a stress headache ( and I LOVE suspense movies). Ha Ha, enjoy!!!!!!!!"
4,"Sick, Slick & Very Funny!","Maybe I have the strange and famous ""British Sense Of Humour"", or maybe I'm just plain sick. I thought VBT was the darkest and funniest film I've seen in ages. I long for more political correctness bashing like this - and excuse me if I'm missing the point here, but Robert Boyd (Slater) wasn't all bad. His heart was in the right place, what with wanting to protect his friends from the consequences of what was quintessentially, an accident.The chainsaw scene was a little too much, even for me, but the ending was fabulous. Diaz' character severely got on my nerves throughout the film with her miniature seating plans and hysterical bride-to-be tantrums etc. but she certainly got her just desserts at the end. Slater's done a few ""on the edge"" roles now and should do a few more - he plays a psycho SO well.I haven't laughed so much for ages, but I must apologise to the other people in the cinema who probably thought they were sat with a maniac in the midst."
1,No Redeeming Values,"Those who believe that Picasso was truly an artist rather than someone in serious need of an optometrist may find something good in this movie. For everyone else, this is pure garbage! Do NOT waste your money or time."
3,"""Stag"" updated","This was a good movie. Not great, but well worth watching... when your mom is not around. The cast is perfect and the comedy ensues as the errors compound, erupting in a final ""happy"" ending. See this movie at least once."
4,This movie pushes you to your ethical limits!,"Kyle (Jon Favreau of Swingers) is escorted off to Vegas by hisbuddies for a bachelor party that will have him in therapy for therest of his life. When the drinking, drugs, and overall debauchery of Sin City kick in, a hooker and a security guard wind up dead. The downward spiral rapidly increases and their troubles follow them back to Los Angeles, where more havoc ensues. Leave your morals at the door for this one, folks. This is a belligerent, modern-day Woody Allen-on-crack movie, a comedy version of Reservoir Dogs that your parents would probably shut off in disgust after 15 minutes. But those of us with a seriously sick sense of humor will find the good in this blacker-than-black comedy. This movie pushes you to your ethical limits until you just give in to the badness. Don't fall too much in love with any of these characters-there's a good chance they'll be pushin' up daisies by the time the credits roll ..."
1,Disgusting,This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I felt so disgusted and disturbed afterwards that it completely ruined my entire evening. I don't understand why people make garbage like this.
2,NOTHING HILARIOUS ABOUT MURDERING PEOPLE,"This movie would have been better if from the beginning they were not trying to make the situations they were in funny. There is nothing funny at all about murdering people whether it be prostitutes, security guards that take bribes, or your best friends. THe time I guess I was supposed to laugh I was more appaled by the moral aspects, then even find it a little funny. I was dissipointed to see Cameron Diaz in that rather bitchy role that was preety stupid if one thinks about it."
1,Complete idiocy.,"This is the worst kind of movie; It wants us to think that it is deep and philisophical, but it is complete garbage. Peter Berg has no understanding of the human thought process and needs to stick to directing (i'll say why later). There was nothing funny about this so-called ""black comedy."" If you think I am saying this because I can't handle violence and such, you are mistaken (I can be pretty twisted). If this was played out as a suspense, and the script revised a bit to fit normal people, it could have been a cool movie. On the positive side, the acting was almost great (besides Cameron Diaz's generic psyco) and the shots and angles were near perfect. Christian Slater scared the **** out of me! Without a grasp of reality and an ability to find *real* funny material, Peter Berg will be reduced to making well acted pieces of trash. P.S. Two seperate times people who should be dead were kept alive longer than humanly possible. This made the movie even more of a joke."
3,"""Controversial"" in some very cheap ways...","On the subject of this intensely love-it-or-hate-it movie, I am torn between absolute revulsion at the most disgusting, morbid movie I have ever seen and the fact that I laughed for about ten minutes straight at the end. When the guy stabs the security officer and they shove him into the bathroom and we have to listen to his screams for mercy as he bleeds to death, we must wonder: are we supposed to be laughing or ralphing our guts out? Nevertheless, chances are you will laugh. But it probably won't be when the whore gets a spike shoved through her head or when the boys get out their power tools and separate the dead bodies into easily transported cubes."
2,A Very Bad Thing,"I was drawn to this movie because it was billed as a ""dark comedy"" I thought that meant that it was supposed to be funny, at least on some level. But, it wasn't funny (darkly or in any other way). It was not suspensful because it was predictable. It did however feature a very hip cast... except for Daniel Stern and Leland Orser who provided us with the extremities of acting (overacting and no acting). This movie reminded me of the late HBO series Tales From the Crypt, minus the cryptkeeper."
4,Addictively Sick and Definately Insane,"The opening scene at a very wild bachelor party in a Vegas hotel room is the movies hook. After being shocked into submission by this scene you will not be able to turn the movie off (try as you might) The remaining scenes are less interesting and pointlessly violent yet increasingly insane. Cameron Diaz also throws some extra ""spice"" into the movie and over-all it makes an excellent movie for someone who lives in a boring suburb to watch. But prepare to be shock to a degree that you will remember every scene the next day. Especially shocking to women."
2,Pretty Lame,"""Very Bad Things"" does contain all of the necessary elements of a dark comedy. Unfortunately, the mark of a truly great dark comedy is how effectively it drives its satirical point home, and this is where ""Very Bad Things"" lacks. It takes pokes at a variety of topics, but never leaves you with a feeling that you've affirmed or uncovered some great universal truth. Well acted, but not even close to being the best dark comedy ever (Dr. Strangelove gets my vote). Get this movie ONLY if you have to choose between it and ""Ishtar."""
4,The Darkest of Dark Comedies Ever!!!,"Not for the light-hearted, ""Very Bad Things"" is full of just that. The understated title gives you a clue that the viewer is not to take the events too seriously, but to enjoy tragedy (of nearly Shakespearean proportions) with the idea that sometimes things get so bad you have to laugh. Cameron Diaz waltzes a wonderful line between sweet and psychotic. You really feel the horror of the spectrum of distasterous events and losses that occur, something other similar films haven't dared to try. A film with a moral, no one is innocent and everyone gets what the deserve in the end. It should have been billed as a ""Comedy/Thriller"" as this ""comedy"" gave me nightmares."
5,INSTANT FAVORITE!!,"This movie is one of the best, wittiest, most surprising movies I have ever seen! Parents exercise caution; however, its definitely adult subject matter and maybe a lot demented, but a must see for anyone that appreciates good movies. Swingers fans- dont worry Jon Favreau will not disappoint you. Great cast! Warning- this film is not for the simple minded."
1,Are you trying to make people attend therapy??,"I thought this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Just when it started to get bad (the first 10 minutes) it got worse. This movie has little to no plot and leaves the audience with a feeling of disgust and resentment of spending their time see such a horrible film! Movie buffs, spend your time and money somewhere else, unless you are ""Very Depressed Already""."
1,SCARY!!,"i am hardly ever shocked, but freak out!! this movie shocked the heck outta me!! its like they took every shocking and bloody thing that could happen and threw it all into this one movie!! i had to cover my eyes sometimes cause i couldn't believe how morbid it was!! it was disgusting and not very funny. pretty sad. i don't care if its black comedy. too black to be comedy. dont' waste your time."
1,sick and twisted,"I am amazed at how many people liked this movie. But then again the movie review in the papers were all ""must see."" Also surprising is the fact that it got released at all. It is demeaning to the intelligent and sophisticated mind, and demoralizing to view. With movies like this out there it is not a wonder at all that we have the problems in this world that we do. Forgo this movie for almost anything else."
1,"Why can't I pick ""0 stars""?","After reading some of the reviews in this list, I thought I'd give the movie a try. News Break: This movie is NOTHING like ""Shallow Grave"", ""Heathers"" or any of the other black comedies I enjoy. Slater's character is a F-ing psycho, Cameron Diaz is a whiny brat (which was refreshing, though still annoying) and most everyone else was just sort of there to be used as props to either be killed or verbally abused. Everything seemed strained, as though the filmakers just wanted to push the envelope as opposed to doing something with real originality. Probably the most annoying film since ""Eight Heads in a Duffle Bag""."
5,"""Pulp Fiction"" meets ""Shallow Grave"" .... in better !","Terrific, Funny, cynic, a great punch to the american dream and to Las Vegas city . Christian Slater in his best part : simply diabolic ! And Cameron Diaz is here a kind of a anti-Cameron Diaz able to do everything to get married,... everything.... Wonderful!"
1,Very Bad Things = Even Worse Movie,"About as much comedy here as you'll find in an ingrown toe nail. The film relies on guts, gore, stupidity and a lot of shouting between the characters rather than an intelligent script. I can't help but compare this with the somewhat similar ""good plan goes awry"" plot of A Simple Plan. The latter film develops emotion for the characters - even the not so nice ones. There's not a single main character in VBT that causes one to even care what happens to them. VBT does not work as a comedy - even black comedy (try Fargo if you want to see a textbook example). It doesn't work as drama. There's practically no character development. This thing just plain does not work! The only saving grace to this movie is the incredibly gorgeous young Asian lady who plays the prostitute! The director should have kept her character alive and killed off all the rest!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Definitely one of the top ten worst movies of all time. The description of this movie sounded like it could be funny, but it is instead a painfully unfunny attempt at dark humor.The characters are not realistic, and the bad acting only made them worse. Cameron Diaz's character has no point in the movie, and Christian Slater was so horrible that I kept wishing his character would get killed off. Most of the movie consists of several people screaming at the same time, very annoying and hard to sit through. The story line starts out with a plot, and then goes nowhere. People just keep getting killed off and it just gets repetitive and predictable. I was hoping that this movie would get better at the end, but it just kept getting painfully worse. Don't waste your time."
2,"One death leads to another, to another, to another....","How dissapointed am I? I love dark comedy, but this one missed the mark entirely for me. I really thought with a cast like this that this was an underrated gem that slipped through the cracks. Well, I can honestly say (and I know every previous reviewer has said it) that it lives up to its title.Basically Favreau is getting married and so its off to Vegas with his best friends for the bachelor party. The stripper is killed by accident and then the blood bath continues as covering up one accidental death is not as easy as they planned. I'm sure each cast member that gets killed off was relieved when it was their time to go to escape this pointless mess. I have never wanted to punch Cameron Diaz more than everytime she opens her mouth in this movie. Not to mention Daniel Stern and his non-stop freak outs. The whole cast deserved better. Save yourself the trouble."
3,Wow.....,"I am a Christian Slater fan, and thought this movie would be funny. Well, it was...sort of...but I wasn't expecting a dark comedy and, because it's really not my thing, I probably wouldn't have chosen to watch it had I anticipated it. However, if that is your cup of tea, I would have to recommend it as it is a well done movie with a good cast, good acting...but somewhat disturbing..."
3,Great acting....not funny though...,"As many other reviewers have stated, I would definitely not call this a comedy (not even a dark comedy). This was much more of a dark drama. However, I will have to disagree with everyone who has said that the acting is poor. I think that Christian Slater did a fantastic job in his role, and the other big name actors and actresses were surprisingly good with what they had to work with. I think the plot was interesting, but not fantastic.All in all, if this movie was marketed as a Drama, it would have gotten 4 stars from me. I just don't think it lived up to its reputation as a comedy. The movie itself is good if you let yourself get over the initial shock over the lack of humor, and I will definitely watch it again (and will probably enjoy it more now that I know what I am getting into). Still a good buy, just be prepared for what it is."
1,"Very, very, very bad society we live in","that could condone the production and marketing of a film like this. I'm convinced that eveyone who gave this film 4 stars or above also ordered Time Life Books ""Serial Killers"" for some reading enjoyment on a rainy day. Lets face it, this movie represents a very sick scenario that when it actually does happen in real life, the perpetrators get the death penalty or life in prison. I would like to see the people who laughed through this movie, or proclaimed it as brilliant do the same after it actually happened to a member of their family. You people have way to much time on your hands."
5,Excellent Filters at an Excellent Price,These doe the job and the 6 pack was very convenient and cost affordable. No complaints here. Pretty straight forward product.
4,Better that apartment default,It works much better that the default filter my apartment uses. Plus more dust and dirt out of the air. And I have less day where my allergy are acting up
4,Finding home A/C filters,"These filters are just the ones I was looking for and they do the job.But there are SO MANY different types of filters - it was hard to find them. It would be great if Amazon could provide some type of ""buying guide"" for selecting the right filters."
4,"Whew, they fit!","I don't even know how well and if these work, but I was finally able to find filters that fit! It's the HVAC company who has me upset that I have to look so hard to find such a non-standard size filter."
1,Bent badly at ends,The bottom of the filters were all badly bent. I could not tell if it's the packaging or it came this way. I know for sure it will not fit snug in my unit due to the bends
1,Not Impressed,"These don't even last a month. I had purchased the 3M Filtrete 1500 MPR before and was very impressed. I was hoping these would be close to the other ones, but not even. I will have to save my penny's next time and get the 3M Filtrete 1500 MPR."
3,Low air flow,"I installed this filter (1000 MPR) and my air handler could not handle it. The filter restricted so much air flow going into my unit that to coils completely froze. Luckily it wasn't too late when I noticed so I replaced the filter with a less restrictive one and the A/C kept working fine. I'm not saying it's a bad filter, just that it was too much filtration for my specific unit which is about 8 years old. A filter rated at 600 MPR or less works better for me. Recomment trying it if your A/C can handle it. Otherwise go with less filtration. I returned mine for a full refund with no problems from Amazon."
4,Bad deal on a decent filter,"These filters strike a good balance between cost and performance. I've been using them for years. They protect your respiratory tract and your HVAC equipment. People with extreme sensitivity should consider something like the Filtrete ""Ultra Allergen"" line, but the rest of us will be fine with this model. Always, always always, change them at least every three months. Check it monthly the first few changes; it's pretty easy to tell if you need to change it more frequently.However, these exact filters (same manufacturer's part number) are available at my local big-box home improvement store for 33% less than this price. And that their one-off price vs. Amazon's 4-pack price. I'm surprised and disappointed, since Amazon's usually able to beat out the clunky supply chains of the brick-and-mortar-o-saurs."
4,"A good deal, long life for furnace and AC","Ordering in bulk, online, is a great way to get these filters, especially if you are going to the trouble of purchasing high quality filters. This model is a 'mid range high quality' filter -- you can go for more expensive/higher quality, but we have found them to work very well. You can watch for amazon to discount these more or less at different times, depending upon how many they have in stock in the event that you can wait."
2,Got reprimanded for buying,"I bought some of these since I have allergies, thinking I was doing a good thing. Got reprimanded by my AC repair guy for using these. He said never to use these type filters because they reduce air flow too much and cause the unit to ice over. He said go buy the cheap ones. Oh well. Good idea that didn't work."
2,"Overpriced 6 pack, save $20+ at the store","Convenient yes, and I hate going to the store for these things but when I compare the price of these 3M filters (the same ones) sold in 2 packs for $18 at the big box hardware stores which is $54 for 6 these seem very overpriced on amazon.com at $76 (today's price). Which is a shame, amazon normally has the best prices, but not in this case"
4,"It looks like if filters more, but no significant allergy reductions.","I purchased these filters due to my son's allergy problems. When you visually inpect the filters they appear to hove collected significantly more dust in a shorter time then standard filters. However, there has been only a slight reduction in his allergy symptoms. He have been using the filter for about 45 days."
5,Good Filters,"These filters are as described and fit nicely in my opening. They are quite, and a much better deal than I've been able to find in our local stores."
4,Good but pricy,"They work well, but having to change them every few months at the price they are marked, probably better off getting a lower priced generic brand."
4,Very happy,"Great filters, have been using them for some time in our home for cleaner air. A bit cheaper at filters-now.com though."
4,Furnace filter review,"This filter is the same filter I usually buy. I bought it at a less expensive price. This filter works very well with my heating/cooling system.3M Filtrete 1000 MPR, 6-Pack, Micro Allergen Reduction Filter, 16 x 25 x 1"
2,"Description says 6-pack, Only 1","Filters this size are hard to find. When i saw a 6-pack, I was VERY happy to purchase - and the price was GREAT! but only 1 filter was in the box. i wanted to return it but the shipping cost, etc... Plus i really needed the filter. I am VERY disappointed in the false advertising. :("
4,"Travel, Adventure, and Smuggling","This is a great, possibly true, autobiography of a man who smuggled hashish in the Red Sea region during the early 1900's. Lot's of interesting detail about the politics and people of that area during that time. Lot's of adventure while sailing in the Red Sea from port to port. More honor among smugglers than the government officials (of course)."
4,Sharing faith only helps towards peace,"I am a former seminarian and am a student of Catholic Theology. The story is well written and easy to read. I can certainly relate to the seminary life and to the unanswerable & unasked questions. Judaism is an attractive religion and perhaps Catholicism can still learn something from the Jews (John 4:22), e.g. passing on our story to our children at home within a ritual. If all peoples shared their personal conversion stories rather then defending one's own to the exclusion of others, then perhaps we can have peace in our world. I am not convinced that he ever had a religious conversion of the heart with Christianity; only when he encountered Judaism."
5,"This is not another ""Romance Novel.""","I don't normally read romance novels but I was marooned (so to speak) on an island and the only book available in English was ""Passion's Tempest."" I was pleasantly surprised by the well written and seemingly historical accurracy (I am a history major) of this novel. It was also an interesting and exciting story which I could not put down. The characters were very real, interesting & memorable. I would compare this novel to ""The Thornbirds."" I have tried to find other books by this author but have been unsuccessful. I highly recommend this book even to those who feel they are intellectually above reading so-called ""romance novels."" This is definitely not your usual romance novel."
2,maddening,I re-read this book to see if I could find anything about it to like. I know the EB had issues from his childhood but what he did to Leah really was unforgivable. I wanted so much for her to have had at least one good love affair afterward and to have found some mild success in LA. The story just went on and on. He had so many chances to find her....after all he worked for the CIA so the excuse that he thought she had found love or success just did not make sense. I wanted so much to like this book. It started with what read like a true love story but he was just a jackass and nothing he did changed how badly he wounded her.
1,Can I express how bad this is?,"If you are looking for a book with a loveable hero who adores the heroine, this is NOT the book for you. I have never been so disgusted with a book in my life. The hero dumped the heroine early on and then decided years later he wanted her back. He supposedly loved her but he kept dating other women while they were trying to work things out. When she expressed her hurt, this jackazz got angry at her! This was the absolute worst book I have ever read. I need to find something worth reading to wash the thought of this terrible book out of my mind."
2,Can't stand the characters!,"Would've given this book 4 stars b/c of the good writing, pacing, wit, & sensuality. BUT I didn't like the hero & heroine. Michael is portrayed as an externally confident but internally insecure guy who is supposedly so in love with Leah, remembers everything about her, and has thought about her everyday in their 5 years separation yet he flirts with & has sex with multiple women globally. Yeeeaah...Leah, on the otherhand, is portrayed as a vapid, shallow, & emotionally weak woman who uses denial to deal with her problems. Michael & Leah together are plain toxic! It seems like their relationship is built more on lust than deep, abiding love. I don't see them having a solid future together.Read with caution: Good writing but unlikeable characters & unhealthy romance."
3,Extreme Bachelor,"I just finished reading Extreme Bachelor by Julia London and must say that I am a liitle bit disappointed. Her previous novels were filled with wit, charm and at least a modicum of believablilty, but this novel was not. For me the problem with the book was plot, not character. The beginning was so WOW I expected the rest to follow suit. It did, but after one hundred pages veered off into the sunset. Seriously, by the end I was searching for redeeming values. The end matched perfectly with the beginning, but what about the middle? Can two such people actually make it work (let alone end it) like that? I guess that's why it's called fiction. Oh well, Julia London has a talent to sculpt a story beautifully, but I suppose every once-in-a-while even a great writer has a story that should sit a dance out."
1,Pathetic,"Is Ms. London a native speaker of English? If so, her editor should clue her in on the use of colloquial language. Some of the dialogue between Leah and Michael is so stilted as to not be believed, viz., ""I do not think I can do this."" ""I am sure that you can."" Et cetera. Real people just don't talk like that. And how many times can a reader take watching the silly break-ups between two supposedly adult people? Sorry to be so negative, but this author needs to take a creative writing course or something. I think I'll pass on any of her other titles."
1,!@#$ this,I hate this i hate soina i hate manic i hate ever !@#$ing episode in the sires sonic isnt a rock band hes a hero i hate this i cant balive dic whould do something to sonic this well ive got one thing to say to dic F**k you
3,It was okay...,"Maybe, dear, you should spend a little more time reading and a little less time in front of the TV. You really need to learn to spell; you're making a fool of yourself."
2,Better premise then SATAM worse everything else,"Positives: It has better premise that makes sense relating to Robotnik. He takes over Mobitropolis and brings a new law and order. Those who violate it are roboticized instead of him trying to roboticize the entire world like in the Stam version. At least ten times better then ""Adventures of Sonic""Negatives: Horrible charecters being cramed down your throught as Sonic's brother and sister, who are searching for their mom who for some reason is hiding. Even worse, hard rock music numbers near the end or during every episode. I wonder how thses three find time to coriograph a song when they are trying to thwart an evil dictator.Tails is nonexistent which was the third thing that got me going.At least ten times worse then SonicSATAM and no where near the american comic."
4,Sonic Underground rulez,"i think its a pity they didnt have tails and the voices werent great but still i enjoy watching sonic, manic and sonia in their quests. also, manic is my fave sonic underground character and i think its funny in some places."
3,"Barren disk, but nice show.","I loved Sonic Underground since I first saw it. The show may not be Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog or the held-in-much-higer-regard Sonic the Hedgehog, but I find it to be a great show in it's own right. But we're reviewing the DVD here, aren't we?Well, let's see... There are 3 episodes: Beginnings, A Hedgehog's Home is her Castle, and Mobodoon. Of course, most TV show DVDs like this only have 3 or 4 episodes. The thing that bugs me is that there's a bonus episode, but instead of Sonic Underground, it's an episode of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show. Why not include a bonus SU episode on this DVD instead of on the Mario Bros. DVD? You can also watch all 4 episodes in Spanish.So that's it. 3 SU episodes, 1 Mario Bros. episode, and optional Spanish audio track. I suggest picking it up only if you're a major fan of the show. You can just as easily catch SU currently on your local UPN station (check your local listings)."
4,"Sonic, Manic and Sonia are back!","My video of Sonic Underground came on 2nd April 2004, and also it has 3 episodes: Beginnings,A Hedgehog's Home Is Her Castle, and Mobodoon. The good guys are Sonic, Manicand Sonia. and The Bad guys are: Sleet and Dingo, Dr Robotnik.My 7-year-old Thomas Higham watches it sometimes.By Michael HighamPS: Maybe you should watch it."
2,OH wHAT COULD HAVE BEEN!,"I love Terry Gilliam. I like matt damon. I love the production design, the acting and the concept , but he execution of this movie is horendous. There are patches of gILLIAMS'S genius here, but to many cooks in trhe kitchen, year smot intresting failure."
1,How Grimm indeed!,"This movie is a really dark mess; total waste of time.I once read a bio of the real Bros Grimm which said they were linguists who collectored the stories told by persons they encountered while traveling for research. Many European tales are scary indeed, but we have the brothers to thank for preserving the folk heritage.Too bad they didn't make a film about the real story. Maybe someone will yet."
1,Super Turkey,"It has been years since I have so hated a film. Rent it and cringe if you must, but don't even think of buying it unseen.When the film did not simply drift from one act of random violence to the next, it meandered into scenes of astonishing sadism performed by absolutely repellent characters with bad accents.There was little to no plot, the effects are choppy when not gorey, and the story was minimal and composed of scenes stolen from dozens of much better films. The only bit of Gilliam genius in the film were the dozens of little fairy tale quotes that punctuate the action.An absolute waste of time on par with Munchausen. My advice to producers: For god's sakes please stop giving Gilliam big checks. He makes excellent films when reined in on a tight budget, but monsterous piles of celuloid excrement when given tonnes of cash."
2,Grim allright,I love this director but this movie is a dud. Some of the visuals are interesting but it fails to keep the interest. Hopefully JUJU will create a list of movies that should have never been made- this might be on there.
3,Brother slash?!,Good movie but I felt that something was missing. Maybe if the two guys had really kissed at the end. *g*-ksha2222
3,It lost 2 stars because...,"This was a very interesting and entertaining movie. It could have used some subtitles when the French characters were on screen and the reason it lost 2 stars is because of a nauseating and unnecessary scene involving a cat. I won't go into detail about that so as not to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it, but it didn't add anything to the plot and should've been left on the cutting room floor. Still, this movie was alright and a good way to spend a few hrs of your time."
3,GOOD!!,"If you think thst this one is good for a child, then think again. it's not! The cast members fit the part so varry well, and there wes a plot but it wes weak. I had to take a star off because I just thought that they could do more with Little Red rideing Hood, the Gingerbread Man and Honsle snd Grettel. i wood like to see 7 harts in it and the 3 bears too. I love how the storys tied in together. now for everyone fravert cat sceen, grow up it just a movie people."
2,Skip it...,"I had moderately high hopes for this film going in, but was sadly disappointed. At first I thought it would be pretty good because the film opens well and it seemed to have an interesting premise. But it quickly turned into a silly movie with characters that I just could not bring myself to care about. I suggest skipping this one; it's a rental at best."
2,I'm being generous,This movie could have been better. A lot better. I'm being generous with two stars because I love the main actors.
3,This movie's big problem...,"Monica Bellucci is the main villain in this movie, and she is thwarted before she even comes to power, and so the protagonists of the movie don't acheive a decent ending since they are not fighting a decent villain. They would have been in no real danger from her unless she was fully capable. This story could have taken lessons from the more successful villans of Disney, or perhaps Jean Marsh in Willow as well as Return to Oz. A hero and story seem only as good as the opposing force. This movie has none, with the exception of the French against the village. This movie isn't about the French it is about fairy tales come to life. There is not much of a tale here without a villan."
2,"""or maybe not""","Fractured, spastic, jerky; a make-it-up-as-you-go series of special-effects sight-and-sound skits without wit or humor or drama, though the result is usually startling since you have no idea what's coming next.This show will doubtless please fans of Terry Gilliam. Others, don't even think of buying this."
2,Could've Been So Much Better,"A movie or television show is really only as good as what the writer(s) create. While the visual sets and special effects were awesome on this film, the storyline was so bad that I felt sorry for the actors in the film. An excellent cast, great director and even better special effects were all wasted because the writing itself was so stupid. You're almost better off reading the original stories themselves and avoiding this dumb film."
4,Don't be fooled by the naysaying critics,"The critics have given this movie a bad review, but I and my pre-teen boy enjoyed it very much. Apparently, the critics were hung up by comparing this movie to others directed by Gilliam, but since I had not seen those, I was able to evaluate the movie on its own terms. The action moved quickly and was easy enough to follow. Of course, the plot was not deep, but who in their right mind was expecting it would be? Just a simple, fun, action movie that will entertain, if approached without preconceived notions."
2,waste of time,this movie was a waste of time to see...it lacked a plot and was confusing whether it was supposed to be funny or scary...it was just a wierd random genre. don't be mislead by the big names like matt damon...this movie sucked...the only reason it gets 2 stars is because it was slightly funny and in that way it was entertaining.
3,THE BROTHERS ..... NOT SO GRIMM BUT NOT SO GOOD EITHER,"What can I tell you about this movie? Well, lets see.... upon leaving the theatre the one thought on my mind was ""It could have been so much better."" It really had everything going for it, good actors, very good special effects and lets face it wonderful materal to work with. I really think that was part of the problem. Just too much material to work with. If the writers had just focused on fewer fairytales I think the movie would have flowed better than it did. The Brothers just tired to do too much and the movie ended up lost.Now all that being said, I am talking about paying 9.00 to see it at the movies or buying it for 18. If you're going to rent this movie you should enjoy it very much."
2,Good reason it left theaters so quickly...,"I was really disappointed with this movie.The atmosphere, makeup, set decorations were all fantasic! But, unfortunately the script and the director never matched thier quality.First off, if you are expecting any Grimm tales in this movie, you will be disappointed. The Grimm tales are just brief snips scatered through the movie, none of them shown at any length.Also, the director can't seem to make up his mind if this is supposed to be a funny movie or a scary one, the result being that it's neither.Great potential in set decoration and scene design that are wasted in a poorly written and directed story."
1,cat cruelty warning,I watched Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm. I am sickened and appalled at the use of animal cruelty as humor. The scene where a fluffy kitten gets chopped up in a machine is totally unacceptable. It does not add anything to the story and is clearly added as a sick attempt for humor. I am familiar with Terry Gilliam's previous work and feel this is a new and disturbing low. Animal cruelty is not funny. I recommend a boycott of this movie and all of Gilliam's work. Animal right's groups have worked too long and hard to stop animal abuse to allow this kind of warped humor to be used. We need to show that we will not stand for this kind of treatment of animals in films. It is simply not acceptable.
4,Funny and scary,We thought it was hilarious although our son thought it was a little scary. Loved both main characters in the movie. Tragic loss....
3,Not enough spring in the boards,"The Brothers Grimm struggles beneath the weight of a clumsy and leaden script peppered with self-conscious humour. There's the seed of an interesting film here but it never really germinates due to the poorly developed ideas. The first two acts are ponderous but the momentum picks up towards the end and the final act comes closest to realising the film's potential. Some of the manoeuvres used to shoehorn the brothers' fairy tales into the plot are less successful than others (the Ginger Bread Man in particular feels awkward), and at times the CGI is a letdown, while at others it's quite stunning. As with many of Gilliam's films one can envision what he intended here, even though he fails to pull it off. Definitely a curate's egg."
3,Get it only if you have kids,"So-so fantasy movie. Neither the story, nor the acting, nor the visual effects are high caliber. Heath Ledger's performance is definitely forced, Matt Damon is a bit better. At least Lena Headey is gorgeous and acts better than both her male co-stars."
2,don't believe all reviews.,"The Brothers Grimmas with some movies this one does not quite live up to what the studios presented it to be. It is well done, but is more of a comedy then a great thriller. The main characters are a bunch of con artist that have been forced to solve a real magical curse and a mystery. They do however it showed great courage and the special effects were well done. This one is worth the price and will most likely be watched more than once."
4,The Brothers Grimm,"This movie was Good, i thought it was Pretty good. The special effects were Very good. if you like fantasy and adventure films this ones for you."
4,Not So Grim,"In my opinion, people just need to lighten up. This movie is not meant to be taken seriously!! You should see this movie when you are in the mood for silly/corny humor, bumbling characters and strangly interesting portrayals of classic fairytales. I would not recommend this movie for children under 13 because, as we all know, The Brother's Grimm are not known for their sugar and spice stories (unlike Disney)and some scenes may be too intense. Otherwise, enjoy!!!"
1,Movie:) Streaming:(,"We were VERY disappointed with the quality of the streaming video!!! We have used other services without problems so I know my TV is capable of good quality. I contacted Amazon about it through email twice and never got a response, very disappointing. We will never use streaming video service from here again!"
3,fairytale with a sting,It's amazing how writers keep coming up with new variations of those good old fairy stories
2,One time was enough,"My friend and I saw this movie in theaters. I figured that being it was directed by Terry Gilliam it should be a really good movie. I was wrong. I personally feel the movie is too long and drug out. For only being about 2 hours long, I felt more like it was 3 and a half. Towards the end I was thinking to myself ""Can we just get this over with already?"" I was so bored with it all."
1,What a waste,"What a waste - a waste of the $8 for the ticket. A waste of the actors, who are much, much better than this material. A waste of the many special effects. A waste of the location and sets.It's not the worst movie ever. But then, I haven't seen every movie."
2,I've Seen Worse Films.....,"Hmmmm, disappointing movie for the likes of major film stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger.I like the premise of the movie being that of the Grimm Brothers and how they may have come up with the fairy tales they wrote! But other than really good special effects, I can't say the movie was really worth watching! Pass on this film."
2,What a mess! - Miss it!,"I was initially intrigued by the possibilities of a plot combining an action movie with the tales of the Bros Grimm, but also had my reservations. Unfortunately, I did not listen to that little voice in my head and went to see this film. What a big mistake and what a huge waste of time! I was moved at several points to get up and leave the theater - in the end I wish I had. A cohesive well laid out plot and compelling story line would really have been nice things to have!! And the sputtery, awkward acting was most likely a result of not really having anyone at the helm on this ship. Save your money on this one folks....Miss it!"
1,Bad movie,"I watched this movie on New Years Eve and thought it was just terrible. It was a boring, stupid, colorless movie. It could have been a good movie given the actors it had but was so disappointing."
3,rich clasic waste,this movie was suppost to be made 2003 but it had to come out 2 years later of taking out scenes thatdidsnt work and still didn work afterwards but maybe if they cut into 2hours to 1hr cause theres really not that much to be explained you know aboutsaving a girl from a villian an just ende much nearly that it did surprkising operformances by jonathan pryce peter Stormare and heath ledger but still couldnt make it better
2,Grimm film,"This film reminded me in a way of Tim Burton's 're-imaginings'; Terry Gilliam has taken the story of the Brothers Grimm and come up with a novel twist - but one that fails - this one has the Brothers as some kind of 'Ghost-busters' who go around solving ghostly problems for customers.This is quite profitable for them until they are engaged by Jonathan Pryce to do a job, and it turns out there's a real super-natural crisis going on.And Jonathan Pryce kept popping up in the most annoying sub-plot of the entire film!"
4,Enjoyable movie,"This is a really cool look at fairy tales presented in a realistic setting, and I rather like how it was carried off. The idea was rather creative, and kept me engaged, especially as I learned more and more about it, and the actors did a really nice job in their roles. Overall a fun movie, and if you like fairy tales, you will enjoy this retelling, especially as it combines various elements of different familiar fairytales."
2,"I like Gilliam, but ...","I like Terry Gilliam's stuff. Brazil is wonderful and Twelve Monkeys is the best time traveling movie ever, but this movie does not click. It starts off really slow, I gave up once. The second time I fast-forwarded through sections I saw before and was able to make it all the way through. There are some good moments and it does tie some loose ends together, but it is just too weird. The non-fantasical world is stranger than the enchanted forest. The happy ending works, but it was a very convoluted and nonsensical path to get there. I can't recommend this movie. It is Gilliam's worse movie."
3,Not horrible... but not that good either...,"The idea of the movie has great promise. But the story needs more work. It wasn't until a while into the movie, that it actually got good, at the story of the vain queen. But it quickly becomes boring again... and then it picks up again. A lot of starts and stops, til the very end! Only get this movie, if you have extra money to burn."
1,Why was this made?,"I will keep this simple.Disapointing, horrible, waste of time and money.A previous reviewer stated that you need to knock back a few drinks to get through this movie. I agree...knock back enough to pass out..."
1,"Unexpectedly gory, predictable with a really bad ending","The Brothers Grimm was generally without plot, cruel to children and small animals, gory without cause and just plain stupid. The acting from the main charaters was fine, but the rest of the cast was terrible. In the end, neither of them get the girl and the evil queen doesn't die. Please don't take your children to see this movie!!!!!"
2,A light hearted horror story,"As a person who often enjoys horror stories its disappointing.There is nothing particular gripping in this story. The special effects are just okay as is the acting is on the poor side.The story seems to owe almost nothing to the Brother's Grimm. TheBrothers themselves seemed out of place, American style con men in occupied Germany. The French soldiers acted quite stupid."
2,I thought it would be a lot better,"When I went to see ""The Brothers Grimm"" last weekend I was expecting a great film because Terry Gilliam,(The Monty Python Series) directed the movie. I was very very wrong. Indeed The Brothers Grimm had cool special effects and it was fairly funny, but that was not the problem. This movie did not have a good story, it had poor acting, and very dumb humor.The major problem I had with this movie was it was like a puzzle, Gilliam took bits and peices out of other movies, storys, and fairy tales that didnt fit but he still put those scenes in there anyway. Which in the end, the final product looked horrible.Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful."
2,Not the worst movie I've ever seen.,But close.I was stuck in a snow storm in the mountains of eastern California and was able to get to a movie store. Bad choice. I liked shovelling snow quite a bit better actually.
2,Cinematic insanity,"Take the frantic, scene-jumping weirdness of Time Bandits, a few of the more absurd elements of Shrek (you'll know them when you see them), and a great deal more of the 1990's remake of The Mummy than you might expect, put them in a food processer and blend them to a paste, then smear it on celluloid in a haphazard manner and you get a fair representation of The Brothers Grimm. It is a hyperactive, disjointed movie that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up.That being said, there are (few) moments of real humor, and even a vague suggestion of something that was almost brilliant, but missed by a wide margin.Watch it, if you must, for a truly remarkable performance from Heath Ledger."
3,Entretaining,"Its the kind of movie you want to see after lunch, sitting down in the sofa. Its an entertaining movie which helps you pass the time."
1,Disappointment,Whoever came up with this movie has one really messed up mind. I really did not care for it at all.
2,Ugghhhh.. Horrible,"We have decided to only rate Amazon movies from now on that are either GREAT on one extreme or HORRIBLE on the other.Brothers Grimm had a great premise, great sets, etc...The ingredients seemed right but the movie was OH SO PAINFUL AND ANNOYING TO WATCH..... very deadpan humor, stiff acting, silly Jerry Lewis slapstick comedy..... just overall a dreadfully painful movie experience to sit thru.My wife and the guests we had over for movie night all agreed this movie got a ""D"" on the normal grading scale."
1,This is NOT the real-life story of The Brothers Grimm!,"Being a fan of Grimm's Fairy Tales and the Grimm Brothers, I originally thought this movie was going to be the life story of the Brothers Grimm and how they got their inspirations for their re-telling of old, classic tales (in a similar style to the movie Finding Neverland). It WASN'T! The movie made the Grimm Brothers out to be like they're idiotic con-men turned action heroes, not to mention that it shifted WAY too much into the fantasy spectrum (in which they come upon a real magical forest with moving trees and such). This movie was way too unrealistic for me and I didn't stick around to see the rest of it because I was so disappointed. So if those of you are under the impression that this movie is based on the true-life story of the Grimm Brothers (like I was), it is NOT. Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
1,Tripe: Something of no value; rubbish,"Acting = annoying.Story = silly and insulting to one's sensibilities.Typical hollywood idiocy.Complete with degrading pretensions.""The Christians cut down the forest"".How childishly stupid.Don't waste time or effort with it."
2,"Waste of time and money, mislead by Ad trailers and promos","The movie begins as did most of its promotional advertising showing the Grimm Brothers being heroes. Alas, they're frauds, charlatans who bilk money out of local people while the Grimms pretend to vanquish witches and anything the villages live in fear of. As just desserts the brothers are nabbed by a French General (Jonathan Pryce), but instead of punishing them, he uses them for his own designs. At this point my interest in the film waned considerably as Damon & Ledger appear to be nothing more than frightened mice (even appearing dressed as scullery maids while they are forced to scrub floors by the french soldiers). The ending does have a pay-off as Ledger eventually musters up the courage to save the day, but it took so long to get there, it was a waste time and my money and these days that's saying a lot!"
2,Only mildly amusing.,"The main reason why this film is important is that its presence on the shelves of (mostly used) video stores with serve to raise the question,""Why does the much better film released in the 1960s'The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm' continue to remain criminally unavailable on DVD?""The answer can only be that the contemporary American film industryis only interested in making as much money on as much mediochre ""product"" as it can,and is abyssmally ignorant of the rich treasure trove of folklore that COULD be suitable for cinematic interpretation existing internationally:especially in this case from that rich vein of storytelling gold and gemsthat the brothers Grimm mined in the mysterious environs surrounding Thuringer Wald."
1,Tick tick tick goes the DVD counter...,"This is a really horrible movie. There is absolutely nothing going for it. I had to turn it off after an hour and I can't remember the last movie I didn't bother to finish watching.Terry Gilliam, aside from his legendary work with Monty Python, is probably the most overrated director there is. Jabberwocky and Time Bandits were horrible. Brazil and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas were hit and miss. His last good film was Twelve Monkeys...from 1995...11 years ago; and it doesn't look like he'll ever make another one.So skip this one...or at least skip the first hour...who knows, maybe the last half was pure genius."
1,A Truly Awful Movie,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. We turned it off halfway through and I have no desire to ever know what happened in the end. It's not funny. It's gross, disgusting and repulsive and has not one redeeming quality that I can think of. Do yourself a favor and skip it.If you want a good fairy tale based movie with some intelligence, tryThe Company of Wolves."
2,Two hours of my life wasted,"I gave this movie two stars simply because of the special affects, which I was happy to see were kept to a minimum, and for the costumes. Other than that it was actually a waste of time. If you spend two hours doing something in your life you should do something that you can look back and and say, ""hey, remember when we--?"" But The Brothers Grimm is not one of those times. I actually fast forwarded it about 90 minutes into the film to watch the rest go jogging to the end. You can't blame the actors as some on the review board did, it's really not their fault. Blame the script writers and the lousy lines these people have to read."
1,Not everybody can be Tim Burton Or Spielberg....,"So if you saw it in a theater like I did you lost 2 hours...so imagine owing it in a dvd and watching it all day!!! The stupidity we have to watch nowadays...My only comment in reviewing this movie is that it has nothing -no story, not fun, not dialogues, not characters but had to be done for some people to make their money. So don't feed them damn it!!"
1,"Awful, incoherent mess.","This movie's only redeeming quality is the visual effects... as an artist, I have to admire their efforts. But other than that, the movie is just unwatchably bad.There just isn't a coherent plot. The movie jumps from place to place, throwing in random events that leave you staring in confusion at the screen. Every time you think the story has settled down from its bizarre wandering, another case of poor editing shows up to shatter that illusion.Add in bad acting, awful ""humor"", and you'll be looking at your clock wondering how much more you have to sit through."
1,The Brothers Very Grimm,"This movie is a disaster from start to finish. It has no charm, no character development, the dialogue is hard to understand, the actors are sleepwalking and on and on and on... For what audience was this film intended? Although based on fairytales, it is far too graphically violent for children. It is also full of several nauseating scences of insects and the skinning of a cat. The film is far too boring and lacking any story development to interest the average adult. A complete bomb and a real black mark on the resume of Terry Gilliam. Avoid at all costs."
1,HERE IS A HELPFUL PIECE OF ADVICE,Do NOT watch this movie. All of the other people in the room and I agreed to stop it. We did not see the end. We could not discern what the movie was quite about. We could not discern exactly what the Brothers' characters were. We could not discern why there was a web-spitting horse.
2,"Visually beautiful, otherwise terrible","Terry Gilliam just can't get past the visual, much like Tim Burton. Sometimes the visuals don't thwart the rest of the film, sometimes they do.In Brothers Grimm, the visuals overwhelm a film that would have very little going for it anyway. Terrible dialogue, confused plot, poor acting (by excellent actors) -- all under really poor direction.Why are so many characters -- Heath Ledger, Jonathan Pryce, Peter Stormare, among others -- given pointless, thick, accents which, when coupled with painfully confused dialogue, make them all but incomprehensible? Why in the remote village setting, are so many different accents piled on top of one another? Just an example of revoltingly bad scripting.To his credit, Gilliam manages to hold the film together through to its conclusion, but that's about all. It amounts to getting most of the passengers off the ship before it sinks."
5,Another masterpiece by Gilliam,Once again Terry Gilliam delivers well above the heads and beyond the intellect of most viewers.Maybe if he suffered a lobotomy he'd be accessible to the masses and have a commercial hit.
2,Cute idea poorly executed,"The Brothers Grimm seems to have started with the germ of an idea ""What if fairy tales had a real basis?"" That's a good start, but the movie went off the rails after that.The story line was muddled, somehow including the French/German political landscape of 1810 in the plot. The characters are uneven.For example, there is this truly horrible Italian torture specialist who goes from being a terrible and annoying character to a sympathetic character towards the end of the movie with little explanation as to why. The same happens with the ""Trapper"" girl who loses her skins partway through the movie and starts wearing pretty dresses.The conflict between the brothers in unclear and seems to center on one's dreamy nature and the others cynical realism. But the conflict is poorly managed and doesn't play out well.The ending makes little or no sense. Overall, a disappointing effort. Perhaps they ran out of time to hone the script."
2,Real brothers Grimm flipping in their grave!,"The script was clumsy, and the special effects were unprofessional. The letters and signs were in English, even though the action takes place in Germany. I won't even mention the attrocious acting. In Matt Damon's defense, it's really hard even for a good actor to perform well on screen when he has a bad script."
1,A flop from beginning to end,"In 60 years, this could be the worst movie ever made. There was nothing redeeming, whatsoever, about this movie. The story was confusing, uninteresting and sloppy, with no plot at all/ The acting was abysmal. I can't tell you about the very end because after, I don't know how long (seemed like days), all 4 of us finally walked out with about 3 minutes remaining."
2,Over-rated and WAY too many props,"Nelleke ""Nell"" says: """"YOU WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE IF YOU LIKE... Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci), King Arthur (with Clive Owen and Keira Knightley), Pirates of the Caribbean (with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom).""""Ummm, I've never seen King Arthur, but I love those other 2 movies and I would have been fine to not see this one. I'm a total Matt Damon fan and while I wanted to see this back when it came out, it was because I thought the trailer looked really interesting. Sadly, the trailer showed all the good parts, even when they weren't too great. The trailer made the movie seem exciting, even though it wasn't.The movie was borderline comical, so unless thats what they meant...but I thought it was supposed to be kinda suspenseful. The props and costumes were ridiculous. Unlike."
1,Dissapointment,Ima big fan of Damn and Ledger but this movie was well below them. Ledger was good in it but the story was just awful. Bad movie.
3,"""....and I am responsible for 'some' of this.""","That is more or less how Gilliam opens his director commentary track. I just don't know when studios are going to get it. If you hire Terry Gilliam to direct your film, then let him direct your film. It's like hiring someone to paint your house, then painting radom parts of the house yourself in a completely differnt color. That being said........The movie was entertaing. All the cast did a good job. The sets and locations were nice to look at. But, I wouldn't know who to actually recommend the movie to. Your casual viewer, expecting more of a high adventure studio film, might get stumped with some of those Gilliam touches, while a Gilliam fan could just get irritated that there arn't enough of them. All and all it's worth a watch."
5,great entertainment,"As a avid Heeath Ledger and Matt damon fan, I totally enjoyed this movie. The effects were also good. Worth watching."
2,Huh?,"This movie has a worse plot than Monty Python's Holy Grail! Like most of the other reviewers I think that the sets are wonderful, the design, and time era are perfect but... Really, what's the point? There was simply too much to work with, and the writer(s) tried to use all of it, apparently. This movie did have a lot of potential, too! And then they went off and tried to use every fairy tale ever written. This would've made a great Monty Python-style sketch comedy, it really would have. Making them be serious about it was just too... eh. Heath Ledger's character saves the movie to some degree, but the best acting in the world couldn't have made it work."
4,The Brothers Grimm experience,"My daughters and I watched this film together and found it most entertaining. It has a great mix of different fairy tales, comedy and horror which we all enjoyed. It also has Heath Ledger who is very cute! Would recommend it for older children (mine are 12 and 15) as younger ones would find some scenes too scary."
2,Relies too much on special effects,"This was not a particularly good movie. I really had trouble believing that Terry Gilliam actually signed his name to it, he would probably have done better by letting Alan Smithee take the credit, if Mr. Smithee were still around. And I guess Matt Damon just needed the money.There was something resembling a plot, disjointed as it was. So it was better than ""Van Helsing"" which had no plot and was exclusively about the special effects. But ""The Brothers Grimm"" stands as yet another testament that you cannot make a good movie out of a bad one by throwing money at it in the form of an endless barrage of special effects. Especially when the rest of the production is done on the cheap in eastern Europe using glorified extras with unpronouncable names masquerading as actors. This would be a good movie to watch after Thanksgiving dinner, because it's also a turkey and you are going to fall asleep anyway."
2,Could be better,"The movie was not what was expected, I was seeking more stories from the Grimm Fairy Tales"
4,Beautiful time piece,"I had to return this watch due to my now ex-girlfriend didn't deserve such a classy and elegant woman's watch. It definitely looks more expensive than the purchase price but buying the watch through amazon you really get a deal. The one thing I didn't like and maybe I'm wrong, but you can't adjust the size of the watch. I didn't see any links you can take out like I read in a previous review. Gorgeous watch none the less and my ex lost out on wearing a beautiful time piece."
5,Great Watch! Great Price!,I shopped around several weeks before I purchased from Amazon. I was really happy with the service and the product. It was a gift for my wife. I compared the same watch to ones sold at the Movado Outlet and the Movado store and found that Amazon's price was much more affordable with the same high Movado quality.My wife loves her watch and wears it everyday.
4,"My ""Girlfriend"" Loved It","Got it for a girl I've been dating for just a short while so I didn't want to go overboard on price. She'd never heard of ""Movado,"" but she absolutely loved it. With the two-tone design, she can wear it with anything and, being a Movado, it's stylish (without being over-wrought) and keeps excellent time.BTW - You will NOT find this watch ANYWHERE for this price. Believe me, I looked for weeks and noone could touch $257. If you like this time-piece, BUY IT HERE!!!!"
5,satisfied with the purchase,"The product was sent in the estimated time, I arrive in good condition. I sent the requested product. I recommend to the store 100%"
1,"Beautiful watch, but not resistant @ all!","This watch was given to me as a gift. My grandmother bought it at Zales, and it was pre-owned, 1st of all, they didn't tell her it was pre-owned. I checked the ticket because the steel around the sphere was scratched. When we went back to the store to exchange it, she bought me a new one, I wore it right then, and at the end of that very same day (I wore it for like 2 hours), it already had two scratches! And all ""physical action"" I did was drive (if you can call that a ""physical action""). I really do take good care of it, I wanted it to last years because it is a gift; now I don't know if maybe it'd be better to return it! When I went to exchange it, I couldn't exchange it for another model because I just fell in love with the Amorosa model, but what's the point of having a beautiful watch if you know that in tops, 1 year, all of its stainless steel will be scratched and unshiny..."
2,"buyer beware, this watch is not water resistant","I purchased this watch for my wife for christmas.It is supposed to be water resistant.I already is getting moisture under the crystal if it gets wet at all,she does not swim with it.Now it has to be sent off to be repaired.I am hoping the moisture will not affect the watch in the future.movado would warrenty for life,amazon's is 5 years."
4,excellent tool for the kitchen,I use a popular vegetable wash for salads and had a hard time removing suds from greens this device is so good and removes all suds and drys greens perfectly its better than any other spinner I have tried. It has never come apart and sprayed all the contents over the room and I can use the outer bowl as my server I rarely recommend products but this spinner is great by the way I bought mine through a catalog and paid a lot more than the price listed here.
1,A SINGLE USE CAUSED 4 MONTHS OF PAIN,"BUYER BEWARE. SOMETIMES SMALLER IS BETTER. Especially if you want to continue swimming...After having traveled the world for two months, primarily in areas where I did a mile or more each day of ocean swimming using fins + mask/snorkel, I returned to California and bought the Red colored hand paddles. After all, I'm an adult female of average size who is in relatively good shape and had been doing a lot of recent swimming.According to TYR's size guide the red paddles should have been the correct size for me, right? WRONG. I used these paddles ONCE, for an hour, in a lap pool.... with no sudden injury occurring that I'm aware of... but as of the very next morning --- and still 4 months later -- my right shoulder still aches and I still can't swim.Being a good swimmer isn't enough to use these rock-hard, unyielding paddles safely in accordance with TYR's size guidelines. Unless your form is impeccable these paddles are a recipe for disaster.Tyr Catalyst Paddles"
3,This has a pirate flag all over,"This is one of the worst item I have bought over the internet. Not of because of the artist, but because of the quality. This DVD is not, I repeat it is NOT in WIDESCREEN nor in DOLBY 5.1 surround sound. The picture is horrible, it looks like the fith generation of a bad copy on VHS!!!!!, the sound is bad also. I doubt Mr. Blades is aware of this product being in the market because I'm sure he would not put this kind of stuff out. I saw this concert with EDITUS here in the U.S. and I'm giving it three stars for the quality of the musicianship and Mr. Blades' music only. Do not buy this item unless you are a collector and true fan, otherwise you will be very dissapointed."
2,Best thing is the song selections,"In the day of digital re-mastering, there is nothing in more need of work than this. The sound quality is equal to a loud roar. Instead of being able to hear the subtle sounds and textures of the many percussive instruments, you get a blur of poorly recorded sound.I hope he comes out of retirement and display his superb quality of an artist."
1,Very bad quality!!!,Just received this DVD - very bad quality and is a pirated copy. I bought two DVDs from this seller. One called Live! In Concert Ruben Blades and and another called Ruben Blades Cali concert - they are exactly the same !!! but the first is a pirated copy!Waste of maney...do not buy it!I am not bothered to return it as it took over a month to get here and not worth my time and effort to send from sydney australia to the US.
2,Great Music,I love Ruben Blades but the quality on this sucks. SOund and Video are poor but the songs are worth it just to hear them played by someone who is a monster talent. This group ETERE (got it wrong) was one of his best backup groups since seis de solar..
5,A great books for kids of all ages,"As a research scientist, I am frequently annoyed with children's books as they are tend to be cute but incredibly inaccurate. Children are inquisitive and have minds that willingly soak in information. I feel that feeding them erroneous information does much more harm than good.Although this is a kid's book, Diane does a great job of making it accurate while keeping it entertaining and easy to understand. She even touches on current research areas such as play and learning in a fun and easy to read manner. The book is well illustrated with large color images, including a few of mine, which children of all ages will enjoy.This is the first children's book I have recommended on my web page on cephalopods"
1,just wondering...,"The title bothers me. I thought the plural to octopus was Octopi, not octopuses. I guess it can go either way, octopuses or octopi, but it just seems really odd seeing anything but the latter."
2,A dead battery with no replacement from Amazon?,"You spend $500 on a watch and it comes with a dead battery? What is with that? I suggest you do not have this gift wrapped and check. Luckily I got this as a birthday present for my wife and checked it prior to giving it to her. Might be a little disappointing on Christmas morning to open this up and have a non runner.Otherwise nicely, but heavily made. Might be too much for a small woman's wrist. My wife, who is 5'3"" with a delicate build, may return it for another. We both think it is a little big for her. The band is over 1/2 inch wide.Update: Sent back, it was a hassle to get the battery changed, a jeweler said it would scratch the case and we didn't know if it was a dead battery or dead watch. Now I do live out in the country but for the price it should be a working watch IMO. Amazon said refund only so I have $500 tied up until they do a refund. Hassle."
4,"Great watch, poor delivery","The watch came within a few days of purchasing it. It was a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it as well. However, the watch came with a dead battery and instead of returning it to Amazon to have it fixed (and wait to deliver it back Amazon to have delivered back) was not worth the headache. It was a birthday gift and there was no time for that. A bittersweet purchase since it's such a beautiful watch, but what good is watch if the battery is dead."
2,Misleading???,Doesn't come with tail gate piece as pictured in the ad. I am disappointed in that it shows it in ad but does not come? Don't get it?
5,Great Songs,"I love this album. It has a lot of really great songs on it. Some I already had, but most I didn't. It's a lot of fun"
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO WILLIE COLON?,"The most dissappointng part of this psuedo documentary is the way he has glossed over the most important person in his career, Willie Colon. It is inexcusable to revise history in such a blatant cavalier manner. I feel the title is inappropriate. It implies action, almost cowboy style. But there is not a lot of music. Mr. Blades also neglected to subtitle the disk. Not a very thoughful gesture to his core constituency. Save your money"
1,Skip This One,"Timothy Leary wrote a number of stellar books, and also a few embarrassingly silly ones. This one falls into the latter category. Like the other embarrassing ones, this one was written to fulfill a contract upon his release from prison. Given his dire circumstances at the time, he is to be forgiven. Let us remember a great man by his best creations, not his worst."
4,The premiere book on Leary's Eight Neural Circuit Model of consciousness,The eight neural circuits of human development are described in an unusual way as Leary's prose is scattered over various parts of the page. It's the best available introduction on his system. The interested magician may trace her/his own development by the neural circuits understand as general stages of consciousness evolution.
3,A little dissapointing.,"This book is nothing compared to the earlier works of Leary. It almost seems as if Leary, no longer a reputable doctor, is trying to pass off his important message as rebellious drivel. The underlying messages are important and insightful. But why disguise and hide it?"
3,etoiles,"This is well-done, and 'a voyeur's look' at the Paris Opera Ballet, as promised. You do get a good behind the scenes look at this great company, how dancers are trained, how they work in both rehersal and performance, even how they make-up for a performance. My big criticism, though, is that the subtitles get cut off at the bottom. Usually the line, or the second line if there are 2 lines of text, is cut so that you only see the top half (or less) of the letters. This is a huge distraction as its hard to follow. The camera shots then seem too fast and chaotic, probably because it takes so much more time to decipher the subtitles that by the time you get it the picture's changing again. I'm not sure if it was meant for the wide screen, and they never edited the frames for a television, but I think this could have been avoided. It doesn't exactly ruin it, but it definitely detracts."
5,A look into the french ballet style,"This dvd is beautifully done and very up to date. It provides a very interesting look into the life of ballet dancers in France. It has those wonderful segments of classroom rehersals that students of ballet ( such as myself ) long to see in documentaries ( for example, a very intersting classroom performance of the male solo adagio at the end of act one of Swan Lake is provided ). This dvd is a ""must have"" addition to any serious dance video collection."
4,Another brilliant one,"This one is pretty much just the basic quartet of Wynn, Linda Pitmon on drums, Jason Victor on rhythm, Dave deCastro on bass-- so no Chris Cacavas on keyboards. That means fewer 'symphonic textures.' But still SW's interesting 'noir' guitar rock exursions, & in a way a bit closer to the feel of Dream Syndicate. I think there's a little bit of folk rock feel a la Richard Thompson too on songs like ""Bruises,"" but of course Wynn & co. approach it differently. I think the other two albums in the 'desert trilogy' [""Here Come the Miracles"" & ""Static Transmission""] are even more stunning, but I might reconsider after listening to this for awhile. In any case, it's brilliant guitar based roots rock, and maybe just might appeal to Dream Syndicate fans a lot, as some stuff here evokes them I think. Whatever-- Wynn & this band are great."
4,Just fine,"Some reviewers complain that it's milky. It's actually quite clear, about what you'd expect from thick plastic. Not clear as glass, but certainly what I would call clear and what I would expect."
2,ADORABLE!,Only one complaint-the music and lyrics are hard to understand. But the 'butt' shaking is more than worth it.
3,Good album,"1989's AFTER THE WAR was Gary Moore's last hard / metal album, before he was ""Born again"" in blues and released his most succesfull album ever, STILL GOT THE BLUES.And this album, altough a little bit overproduced by Peter Collins, is a very solid record, with the exception of the awful instrumental track ""The Messiah Will Come Again"", that is almost the same song as ""The Loner"", from his previous 1987 album WILD FRoNTIERS. It's boring as hell.The line-up is top of the game, with Bob Daisley on bass, the late Cozy Powell on drums and Neil Carter on keyboards, but you will never know who plays what on each track because, on the ""guest stars"" list, we have also Simon Phillips and Charlie Morgan on drums, Don Airey on keyboards and a few more musicians."
3,A little over the top,"The item arrived in sealed plastic and in a new case along with the security strip. There were no captions available, subtitles were English and Spanish. The subtitles were consistent through out the movie and displayed properly. The story line followed in a squeal like fashion and were in keeping with the first movie. The acting was believable and in keeping with the movie. The scene with statham and the fight at the electric power company was over the top. Though it was no doubt that it was meant to invoke Godzilla type movies. The acting on the whole was good but it did lean to the over the top drama type settings. It did leave an opening for a third installment, I am not really expecting one. This was action adventure but just a bit much."
2,Bad Movie,"I though the first move was over the top, and I somewhat enjoyed it, but the sequel goes so far into unreality that it becomes a mostly horrible and laughable experience. I could barely finish the movie and its extremely rare for me to say that about any movie so I would warn you to skip this and move on to something much better. Jason Statham should find better roles and not settle for trash like this."
5,This movie was great!,"I really liked this movie. It was exactly the type of movie I wanted to see when I saw it. I found it funnier than Observe and Report which is mainly supposed to be a comedy that came out around the same time. This was just an all out crazy, hysterical, fun movie that makes you say ""DAAAANNGGG that's crazy"" over and over."
1,Did not work,DVD would not play in multiple blue ray players. I threw it out. Didn't pay enough for it to return it.
1,Not happy! :(,"dont work on my sony blu-ray player. It came from blockbuster or some other rental store. Case was bigger then my other blu-ray cases, but u get what u pay for I can't be mad."
1,don't buy on blu-ray!,"Don't buy this movie on blu-ray, buy regular DVD version instead. Movie can only be watched if your have connected your blu-ray machine to the internet with an $80. router. My opinion, production company are trying to force the public to spend more money needlessly. Regular DVD is only option."
1,Won't play no matter what on Samsung bdp-1500,"As others have noted, there is a problem with this disk. Others have found a work around for their particular player (memory card,internet connection). All of these ""solutions"" failed to work on my Samsung bdp-1500. This is not the first release that will not work on this player. I ordered a sony player which should remedy this. If the blu ray format is going to gain acceptance,a disc should just play. Why should a consumer have to ""hack"" his player just to watch a movie? Very frustrating and disappointing. Shame on Lionsgate for releasing a disc like this. NO STARS"
1,Almost as bad as a B Rated Cult film,"The movie starts out with instant action and from there slides downhill. There are constant overtures of sex and insane stunts that even a 5 year old wouldn't believe (I wouldn't let anyone under 17 watch this). Jason is an awesome actor and this was the only reason I bought the movie. I really enjoyed the first ""Crank"", but this one is a real let down and I hope that Jason can move towards being in a better film than ""Crank 2""."
1,CRANK 2 IS JUNK!,THIS IS TOTALLY JUNK DO NOT WAISTE YOUR MONEY NOR TIME TRUST ME I AM MUSIC AND MOVIE EXPERT OVER 20YRS EXPERIENCE.
1,Crank2 -Blah,"Crank 2 is a total bomb of a movie. While the original was fresh, and exciting, this sequel is stale, vulgar, boring and borders on the pornographic. The plot wanders and strains to find a storyline amid the mindless set pieces. I could only watch half way before loosing my lunch and turning it off. No, I don't care how it ends. Save your money unless you want to see Amy Smart naked and performing graphic simulated sex ( very demeaning for this actress ). All and all this movie is garbage."
1,Worst movie ever,"I think it is absolutely the worse movie Jason Statham has ever done. Basically whoever wrote it, loves strippers, whores and nudity and sick violence. The better movies he's done are The Italian Job, Transporter, and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. To me, Crank 2 is worst than the first one and it has no plot. He is capable of much better movies like the ones Bruce Willis does. I don't recommend this movie."
1,worst movie i've seen in years,"terrible film. some entertaining bits. i'm even a fan of films like raimi's ""evil dead"" -- e.g. completely bizarre camp. this was just lots of bizarre scenes punctuated by decent chase scenes. (i should also say that i enjoyed the first crank film.)"
2,Shouldn't have been made.,"There was no reason for this movie to have been made. Crank was a nice closed ended movie, then they ressurrected the series by beating the dead horse with an even more improbable storyline. Chev Chelios has, you guessed it, one hour to do something again or he dies. This time, he has get his heart back or he dies, and has to live longer than the one hour, so he keeps having to shock himself to keep his artificial heart pumping. The skin exposure is more, vulgarity is more, the gore is higher, the action is still present, but the flow is aweful. Plus they keep throwing in jokes that are not funny. Jason Statham must have really needed the money. I really liked the first film, but this one could have sat on the shelf. Definately not recommended."
1,What Was This?,"I have seen several of his movies, and enjoyed his self-defense skills. However, with this movie it was disjointed; and didn't make sense to me - low budgeted. I only looked at this movie once, and now it rests at the bottom of my shredder. With decent movies I would share with others, but not this one. Didn't want it in my house. Sorry Jason, I didn't like this one. I think you can do better quality work. Please hold out for more decent action pictures."
1,Totally senseless movie!!,"This is a totally senseless movie! So filthy, unlimited foul words, too much naked. It's the worst movie for Actor Jason Statham. I love his movies but this one, I said ""Huh ?"".I strongly urge you not to buy or rent this movie. Not worth of money to spend."
1,Crank 2: Low Wattage,"I enjoyed the first Crank movie. It was silly and fresh, and it had a good sense of humor about itself.Since it begins with the resurrection of a dead protagonist who survived poisoning and a helicopter plummet, Crank 2: High Voltage obviously needs to be even more tongue-in-cheek, and it is. It's as knowingly silly as a movie about a action-hero with a faulty mechanical heart can be. HOWEVER, it is extremely vulgar and gross...the violence, language and nudity is all excessive. You may find it entertaining, I just fast-forwarded to the ridiculous end. I expect Crank 3: Hypoglycemia to come next spring."
5,Great Action,"This movie was so intense I was on the edge of my seat.Jason Stratham is a super actor,I love the way it started, but surprised the way it ended, can't wait for Crank 3 to come out, I am sure it will happen.Loved it was in blu ray, Action was fantastic, violence was extreme but exciting."
3,Review for the movie not blu-ray,"While the movie plays well on my PS3 (firmware 3.01) and picture quality is outstanding, sound as good as it gets I think they have gone too far with this sequel.Yes, the movie is crazy with lots of funny cuts but in my opinion they have added too many gory scenes to it: cut nipples, cut elbows, guts etc.I only gave this movie credit because of Jason who's one of my favorite actors."
1,Did anyone read the script?,"With good reason, the critics have not been very kind to Crank 2: High Voltage. I must ask: Jason Statham did you read the script? (No.) Did your agent read the script? (No.) Did your manager read the script? (No.) Did anyone read the script? (No). Didn't think so. This movie is horrible on many levels. Its caliber is so low that it called for an amateur actor, not a mid-career or veteran actor. In addition, it could not pass for a made-for-tv film. Final analysis: mindless script filled with filth, soft porn, and little action (in comparison to Statham's other films), remotely entertaining, contributes virtually nothing to Jason Statham's body of work or the film industry. ...FAIL."
1,unbelievable,one of the worst statham movie ive ever watched. poor decision making on his part when he accepted this role
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"Okay maybe not the worst ever-there have been some truly terrible movies made-but it certainly was a disappointment & deserves at least honorable mention for the Worst Movie Ever title.I liked the first Crank and loved other Jason Stratham movies. I was expecting this to be a good movie and took a friend to see it. Unfortunately it went from silly to stupid in a hurry. I was embarrassed to have recommended it to anyone. We almost left.I would definitely recommend renting, borrowing, watching it on TV, or downloading before buying. If you're into ridiculous over-the-top off-color humor it may be your movie, but I still wouldn't recommend buying before you see it."
1,"Nothing like Original Crank, A Total Disappointment!!","I absolutely loved the first Crank. It was full of action and humor. It kept you on the seat of your pants the whole time. The second one? Horrible. If you're looking for a second Crank like the first, don't watch this one. It was horrible with the ""special effects"" they added. It was cheesy. I was so excited to see this movie, and it ended up a waste of time. I just wanted to shut off the movie. Why would you go and take a great first movie and ruin it. I'm so glad I did not spend money to see this in a theater. I sincerely hope they don't make another Crank. If they do, they need to revert it back to the original movie. If it's anything like the second movie, I see a box office bomb waiting to happen. I can't even begin to describe how unhappy I am with this movie."
1,This movie is BAD!,"I wathed Crank 2 last night. I thought Crank was bad, but this is even worse. I can't believe that Jason Statham would actually appear in this movie. I thought ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devils Rejects"" were bad, but this may top event those! Jason, how could you even make this movie? Please, no Crank 3!!!!!!!!"
1,"Mud, blood, brainless porno butcher movie","This movie is porno in mud! Do not let children watch it. Nude bodies appear through whole movie, Crank f*g some prostitute in the middle of the day in thousand eye witnesses in the middle of stadium. They even had to blur some parts of their bodies but not all the time. Lots of blood, gangs, brutality. Movie made in trashed gang like streets. Its look like butcher movie. I almost through up.....[Cancel] [Delete post]Guidelines"
2,garbage,"All these guys reviewed this movie as if this is the best guy flick ever....Really?? This movie was crap .. But I guess if you like asians as prostitutes , overdone sex scenes , david carradine ...yeah the one who died in Bangkok doing terrible things with minors , and poor grindhouse wannabe filming along with a plot that matches .....then enjoy. Statham should go up in class with his action films not down.Amy Smart she kept declinig after butterfly effect ."
3,Crank,"This was a okay movie, it arrived in plenty of time, and was in great shape, I would recommend this sell to others."
2,Terrible Movie... First One Was Great,"I highly recommend the first of these, but the 2nd was a disappointment. It was too much of the same thing and seemed forced."
3,Strange!,I know this is supposed to be a really good movie but I just didn't get it. Too strange for my tastes!
1,DVD Does Not Work!!!,"I wish that I would of read the other reviews about this blu-ray. I tried it in two different Blu-ray players and it would not work. I tried it connected to the internet and by itself. It did finally work in my computer blu-ray player but their extra ""live"" stuff did not function properly and caused it to be unviewable. Do not buy the BluRay version of this movie."
3,How to actually watch the movie if you have problems doing so,"When I first inserted this disc into my Sony Blu-Ray Player, I was greeted with a tiny window into the actual previews and movie. Nothing I did helped. I wrote in to Amazon, and got a replacement disc, which presented the same problem.Only then, after consulting the wonderful internet, did I realise that Crank 2 plays hell on a number of blu-ray players, and some either need to get their firmware updated, or some, like mine, simply needed an external memory device plugged in.I inserted a thumbdrive into the rear of my player and viola, the movie worked. So for all of you who are having problems, do try that."
1,Did not work with Samsung BDP1500,"Latest firmware update and Lionsgate update, have SD card and internet connection. Trailers play, menu loads after four to six minutes, movie begins with audio and no video. If you return to menu, the background plays in a loop but menu functions (and any way to exit) are gone. Tried rebooting ten times, never worked. All other blu-ray discs play without problem."
4,Great sequel!!!,"I enjoyed ""Crank"" and this IMO was better. This movie was over the top, it's supposed to be that way. It's a movie and a very entertaining and crazy one. There are moments in the film where I was blown away by the action, and there were moments in the film where I had to look away due to a few disturbing scenes. Overall, I highly recommend this movie and it was fun to watch.This movie in 1080p is unbelievable. Crisp, clear picture and audio quality. Wow, Amy Smart is fine!!!"
5,Proceed With Caution!!,"Crank: High Voltage is the superior of the two films not because it knows it's a second helping of something that is all empty calories, but because it's simply more than the other oneYou're liable to watch the whole thing with an expression of bafflement on your face, surprised, delighted, and alarmed by what you're seeing.The result, an eye-popping strobe of flesh and blood, is as visually stunning as it is absurdly offensive, sure to thrill some while leaving others in a state of outrage-induced catatonia.If someone was charged with creating a graphic, bizarre cartoon for adults, that someone might conceive of 'Crank 2: High Voltage,' one of the most insanely outrageous movies ever made"
3,"Not bad, once I got it to play","The movie itself was OK, but it took two days and several web searches to get it to play on my Sony BDP-S350. I did not have a flash drive installed, so the movie would not load. Once I discovered the problem, none of the flash drives that I owned were small enough to fit into the Sony's opening. If you are not going to be able to play the movie without installing extra memory, it should be noted SOMEWHERE. It is my understanding that Netflix stopped shipping the Blu-Ray version because of the issue."
3,Hmmm... way over the top,"First, if you are having trouble loading this disk, please try inserting external memory (SD card into SD card slot or ""jump drive"" to USB port). This did the trick for me (Pany BD60).I did enjoy the first Crank - a rather good guilty pleasure flick.This second movie recycles tons of gags from the first one - it got a bit tedious toward the end.The movie has its moments, though."
1,F.U. Chelios,"If you've seen crank one this is the same movie basically. Really fast, really crazy, unbelievable, perverted, and strange. There's even a weird Godzilla like fight. Can't recommend it."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS I HAD HOPED,"I guess this is one of those movies you have to be in the right mood to watch. Gory, gross, stupid, sometimes exciting, sometimes humorous...it is all these things, but the dark charm that was in the first film is missing here. I was really looking forward to seeing this since I enjoyed the first CRANK film so much: it was smartly directed, funny, shockingly violent, and just plain fun. This one I did not find fun. I found it very disappointing. Jason Statham is good as always and his character is still immensely likeable. Too bad I can't say as much for the film itself. Oh, it has its moments of manic inspiration to be sure, but overall it's just a bad trip. The DVD arrived quickly from Amazon and in excellent condition."
1,Major letdown,"The first crank had a good story line and good action, but the sequel is full of corny action, camera views and was just painful to watch. I love Jason statham movies but this movie definatly is his worst."
1,Biggest Disappointment!!!!......,"I am one of the biggest fans of Jason Statham. I have seen all of his movies and I actually own all of his movies. But Crank2 is not only his worst movie ever, but also one of the worst movies of all times. You would expect a really cool action movie, like Crank 1, but instead, what you get is a freak show and stupidity. I am very disappointed with Crank 2!!!! Come on Jason, what happened to you??"
4,An excellent basis for a series of lab exercises,"An excellent book on using Linix to build routers. It provides a very through description of how to use ipchains in conjunction with forwarding, masquarading, accounting, etc.The book is organized around chapters which describe how to build: a LAN router,an extranet router, a frame relay router, an internet router, a satellite office router, and an internet services router.The book would make an excellent basis for a series of lab exercises.Another excellent feature is appendix C, which describes how one can use VMware to experiment with virtual network configurations.Students (and instructors) should be aware that there are some minor typos in the text and diagrams - for example figure C.1 has two subnets labelled ""A"", the righthand one should be ""B""."
3,Gap Band Hits,"At least 4 (or more) of the tunes on this are not worth listening to; but, the most known RB/Funk hits are here, especially 'Outstanding'. It's best to use this for dubbing."
5,A refreshing and enlightening book.,"I found Pride and Joy a welcome oasis in the desert of mainstream thought reguarding parenthood. Terri Casey pulls down the facade of conventional wisedom to reveal another point of view considering women and motherhood. The stories of these child free women were touching and inspirational. The interviews gave a striking retort to the banal dogma of woman as the powerless functionary of human reproduction. That a woman can be happy, live a creative, full and meaningful life without being a mother is an important concept which we all must come to accept if we hope to have a more civil society and healthy planet."
3,"Insightful, interesting, and well-written but a little bland","Terri Casey's subject matter is important and should help provide support and affirmation to women who have chosen to remain childfree. Still, after randomly reading about half of the stories, I found myself uninterested in the remainder and overall, a little disappointed in the book as a whole. It lacks something - I'm not quite sure what."
2,Women Without Children...,"I really enjoyed reading books like this one. I chose not to have kids when I was a teenager. I prefer to be independent and have a more spontaneous lifestyle, than one that is planned all the time when you have children.I chose, because it just how I feel. I couldn't see myself with a large stomach anyway...UGGHHH!! I was fat before and don't want to have to ever see that again. I can work, go to school, and still have time for a social life. If I had a kid, no social life and work too damn long and hard. Wouldn't have time for nothing for myself.I saw how my mom was when she had me and my 2 brothers. No social life, gain too much weight, and work too damn long and hard. No time for us, hardly. So, those are my reasons for not having kids. I'm glad too. I'm a free-spirited...Leana"
4,"It's Hillerman, but it's not the best...","No one likes Tony Hillerman more than I do, but The Skeleton Man -- while worth reading -- is basically a 120-page narrative pumped up to twice the length.It's like the old idea about giving a speech: ""tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em, tell 'em, and tell 'em what you told 'em."" That's the principle here. There's an unprecedented prologue, where Joe Leaphorn recaps the plot, then there are several places during the narrative when the events are recapped, and it gets distracting.Even Jim Chee's romantic life is reviewed in some detail. I hope Tony Hillerman is well, and that we have more to look forward to..."
3,A disappointment,"Like many of the reviews here, I have to agree that the latest entry by Tony Hillerman is a disappointment. His series has been so strong and my fervent wish is that his next entry returns to his strengths.This book suffers mostly from the lack of his two strong characters. Both Leaphorn and Chee are somewhat in the story line but their participation is lackluster and particularly for Leaphorn, very peripheral. The plot is hard to believe and the story is carried along by the actors in that same unrealistic plot. He brings some of his old magic to the description of the landscape of the Southwest but ultimately, the book is a disappointment.I'll wait and hope for the next Hillerman and the return of his magic touch!"
3,Why weren't we invited to the wedding?,"I found the story entertaining, but after suffering through all of Jim Chee's unsuccessful forays into Love, why weren't we invited to the wedding when he finally found his girl? This book was rather sparse on indian folklore, and missed an excellent opportunity to give us more of that at Jim and Bernie's wedding. We got only ONE SENTENCE about the wedding. I think the faithful Hillerman readers deserve more!"
3,Skeleton Man,Got every thing just fine. Have not had time to lisen to tapes so don't know how they are.
2,Best Seller List--oops,"I'm about half-way through this hard-to-read, discombobulated mystery. I think it has to do with a diamond, or is it a bag full of diamonds? Are the words filling the pages or is it just pages full of words. I have begun speed reading in order to locate some meaningful passage. I fear I may have missed a few of those also. So much for Best Seller Lists."
1,The second worst Hillerman Novel,"Early Hillerman books in this series are wonderfully evocative of the four corners area, one can smell, taste and feel the locale. The characters were carefully delineated, as well, the personalities distinct. This novel feels like it was cranked out to make money, the characters have turned into simplistic cartoon forms. Anyone could fit into the various roles, Hillerman characters or anyone else's. The plot is interesting but that's it. I've always eagerly awaited the newest of the books in this series but I won't spend money on any more until the writing improves. One wonders if someone else has written this for Hillerman"
1,Skeleton Man,"I never thought I'd ever give a Hillerman only one star. This book is a mess. Plot points appear never to reappear, items are brought up and never elaborated on, such as a pollen pouch with a strange design. Lt. Leaphorn (ret) asks his lady friend for assistance in understanding part of the story, we never hear of her again. Supai indian belief is brought up intermingled with Hopi belief and Navajo belief and none are clear. I have the feeling Mr. Hillerman had a contractural obligation and put his word processor on auto pilot."
2,I wish it was better.....,"I've been a huge Tony Hillerman fan for years; but his last three books haven't been up to par. ""Skeleton Man"" should be very good but isn't. The action gets progressively harder to follow as the story goes along. Characters seem to be mixed up in time and place once they start arriving at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Part of the confusion could have been avoided if the book had been edited better. Being a fan, I would have bought the book even if I had known it was a difficult read. I hurts to say it, but perhaps it is time for Mr. Hillerman to enjoy a well earned retirement"
4,Getting There,"I had been a bit disappointed by the last couple of Tony Hillerman's books. This one was much more like the 'old' Hillerman. I am enchanted by how Hillerman moves Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn along the road of life, gives interesting insight into Navajo and Hopi culture, and still presents good solid mysteries. Hillerman is an outstanding writer with a relaxed and easy style. Like all of the earlier Chee/Leaphorn novels this one leaves you a bit breathless and with a smile on your face. Really good stuff.Why the four stars instead of five? Well, the resolution of the mystery was a bit abrupt. Hillerman could have written an entire chapter to take up the loose ends, but he elected to do so in a couple of paragraphs. It left me feeling a bit left out, that's all."
2,dissappointing trip to the Grand Canyon,"The Leaphorn mysteries have always sparkled with desert indian myth and mysticism. Many of the novels maintain a mystic tension to the very end. This novel collapses half way through. The Skeleton Man never appears and his presence is never explained. Subplots that look interesting never develop. An character shoots an investigator point blank with a heavy calibre handgun. The potential for a noir player develops. Then, the victim mysteriously recovers because Hillerman is unable to bring the subplot back into focus. Very weak for Hillerman."
5,Tony Hillerman does more very artful Navajo Weaving,"This was one of Tony's last novels. In it, he carefuly weaves together a story involving input from various people and events that help Joe (and Jim) solve what ordinarily would be so complex a mystery, even the FBI would simply overlook most of the real story that exists in layers under the wind-swept playas south of Shiprock. It's a very enjoyable story, because of Tony's well-developed characters as well as the well-developed story. Tony gives us the bonus of rich relating of cultural tidbits involving several cultures, but mainly those of the Diné and Hopi, also educating us on how well these two supposed-""enemies"" actually get along quite well."
4,another winner,"""Skeleton Man"" is another in a long line of engrossing Tony Hillerman mysteries. Tony's ability to bring alive the exotic locales in the Four Corners country is legendary. This time he makes the Grand Canyon itself a character, along with our old friends Jim Chee, Joe Leaphorn and Cowboy Dashee. Hillerman weaves a vivid, absorbing tale derived from a real airline disaster over the canyon that occurred more than half a century ago.Roger L. Conlee (author of ""Counterclockwise"" and ""Every Shape, Every Shadow"""
5,another Hillerman classic,"Skelton man is one of my favs by hillier man. The story flows smoothly.Tony Hillerman has a way of immersing you in a culture that you as a non-native american will ever be able to do. He takes the traditional Sherlock Holmes kind of character and morphs him into a Navajo cop. I have always found all of his books to be interesting, thrilling, and informative. My older brother gave me my first Hillerman novel many years ago. At one time I owned all of his works either in paperback or hardback. When my eyesight began to go at the age of 56 I thought I never again could thrill to his stories. Now that they are all in the Kindle format I am one happy camper. Try one of his books. I think you will become addicted to him just like me."
3,Hope We're Not Seeing Tony Over-the-Hillerman,"Like his most recent novels, this one doesn't sing like the earlier ones did. Just a mediocre Hillerman novel -- maybe he's tired. This novel didn't need Leaphorn at all -- he merely serves as a weak narrative tool. The premise of the novel -- the diamonds falling from the sky over the Grand Canyon -- was a good one, but I don't think Hillerman developed it very well. As others have pointed out, it looks like it was written on automatic pilot. And, like someone said, there are more than a few plot points that just dead end. I'll always buy and read Hillerman's books but they seem to have lost a certain magic. On the other hand, his descriptions of the Navajo/Hopi country are superb, even unsurpassed. Everytime I read a Hillerman novel, this Easterner wants to jump in the car and head west."
2,Tony...You Can Do Better,"I have read everything Hillerman has written and will continue as long as we are gifted with his earthly presence, however, Skeleton Man is a big let down. This novel is very cerebral, as if he has crafted a puzzle that he wants to share and writes it all down without flair or style. The plot is exciting, but unravels into a confusing and mediocre ending. Keep writing, Tony, but get a better editor."
2,Too much plot,"This latest Chee/Leaphorn novel does not do enough to distinguish itself. What sets Hillerman apart from other mystery writers is the rich evocation of Southwestern landscape interwoven with Native American cultural and lifestyle descriptions. The plots are usually more or less interesting foils for this cultural/landscape portrait. When overly complex plots about corrupt Belagona behavior dominate the books the ""real"" Hillerman is diminished. Such is the case with Skeleton Man which does not really get interesting until Chee et al descend into the Grand Canyon near the end of the book.Unfortunately, this is the case with most of the later Hillerman books. I long for the good old days of ""The Blessing Way"", ""Thief of Time"", ""Listening Woman"" and ""The Dark Wind""."
2,A real letdown,"I've read all of Tony Hillerman's Leaphorn/Chee novels and looked forward to this one eagerly. Disappointing is the only word to describe my feelings about it. The narrative point of view jumps all over the place, and the reader never maintains an identification with any of them. The plot is not very interesting. We don't see enough of Chee and Manuelito to care much about them. But perhaps the biggest difference between this novel and the previous works is in the atmosphere. No one created a sense of place better than Hillerman. But like the narrative technique, the atmosphere here is diluted. Grand Canyon in a rainstorm just isn't as interesting as the off-road desert of New Mexico.Perhaps as readers we don't want writers to try something new. I hope that is not why I didn't enjoy this. I try to imagine that this is the first Hillerman book I read--would I read another? Honestly--no. I can only hope for better next time."
2,Skeleton Plot,"I've long been a big fan of Tony Hillerman but I have to say I'm disappointed in his latest novel. The plot is thin and Hillerman constantly interrupts his narrative and obscures the storyline with asides about Navajo and Hopi culture. He's always been commendably sensitive about native American traditions, but he's lost much of the suspense his earlier novels featured with his extraneous references."
1,Skeleton Man Skeleton Man Skeleton Man ...........,Not one of Hillerman's best. The story line is thin and obvious. But most aggravating is the repeating of story facts....over and over and over and over again. Leaphorn has basically a cameo appearance. Not a bad effort if this was Mystery/Adventure 101.
1,Bury it,"Skeleton Man is not one of Hillerman's best. Details of the story were needlessly repeated--how many times do we need to know why Joanna Clarke was looking for the diamonds and the bones of her father? Even the plot was weak with a miraculous appearance of the Indian woman to guide Bernadette to the hidden diamonds. Though the landscape descriptions and details of Indian lore are interesting, they are not enough to carry the reader through the story. I hope Leaphorn and Chee have more compelling adventures in the future."
5,A MEATY BOOK FOR SUCH A BONY TITLE!,"SKELETON MAN, the latest from Best Selling Author, Tony Hillerman, is a literary feast. Oh, I know, fiction of this sort is supposed to be as flat as pancakes. But now and again an author comes along who changes the stereotype.In SKELETON MAN, Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn team up once again to solve a mystery that's steeped in the lore of the West. From downed airliners over the Grand Canyon to corrupt businessmen to missing diamonds worth millions, the book is a page-turner and continues Hillerman's masterful mystery making ways. And, as usual, the tapestry (or should I say Navajo rug) is woven neatly with all sorts of references to the colorful culture of the Native people of the Southwest.A must read for all Tony Hillerman aficionados or those picking him up for the first time!THE HORSEMAN"
1,The true about Alexandre Pires,"To the people that don't know Alexandre Pires, because you don't live in Brazil...: some time ago he was drunk and with his imported car Alexandre killed a person. He wasn't arrested, because he is famous...If you understood my message... One more thing: does he write all his lovely songs (I'm not talking about his samba songs)?"
1,Warning! Tiny print masks gross verbosity,"I've read lots of academic books in the course of studying for several degrees, but this has to be one of the most impenetrable. It's almost impossible to read because of the typeface which seems to be 9.5 font size - even with my glasses this is very tiring, and brings up the question why so small?There is only one answer, and that's to keep the book of manageable length, which then leads to the question why is the book so long? Why indeed. The author is far too prolix - the text should have been edited down by at least a third - perhaps then it may have been possible to persevere with the turgid prose.But, probably not as the author doesn't seem to have much original to say, rather just surveying what has already been said and criticising that. Oh, for something cogent and readable on the subject of religion and feminism."
3,a bit of a disapointment,"This book for young girls started out well, but had a lousy ending that left me hanging.Abigail tries to reinvent herself at summer camp. She does a decent job of tackling challenges, but unfortunately starts to care more about pleasing her peers than herself. She accepts a terrible dare at the end that has bad consequences. The ending was too vague in my opinion. I think the author should have written a couple more chapters letting us know what happened to Abby and her loved ones.If you want to read a terrific camp story that has a more satisfying ending, try Hail, Hail Camp Timberwood by Conford or I Want To Go Home by Korman."
4,Abigail wants her camp friends to think she is brave,"11-year old Abigail enters summer camp with a confidence she has never had before. She wants everyone to think she is brave, so tells them she will never say no to a dare. The dares get worse, and soon Abigail starts bending the rules. Se shaves her legs, and pees in her friend's mouthwash. The one thing Abigail doesn't want them to know is, she is a coward at home!"
4,Creative ideas for camping,"This really is a cool book, with all sorts of ideas for cooking in the outdoors, many that I had never thought of, (like cooking eggs and bacon in a bag stuck on a stick over the fire). The first part of the book talks about outdoor cooking at home, and has some neat frugal ideas for outdoor parties, then the book delves into camping for a chapter or so. (Dian has some really good organizational ideas for large and small groups.) The last 3/4 of the book is devoted to camp cooking. The ideas for cooking over the fire are really cool, and for someone who has done only a bit of camping and car camping at that, really unusual. However, if you like your food fresh and not from a can or packet, the recipes are pretty useless. Here are your cakes made from cake mix and canned fruit, casseroles with cream of whatever soup and all sorts of seasoning packets. If this sort of thing does'nt bother you, then the book should be perfect, if you're a health nut like me, it will."
3,some innovative ideas,This book had many neat ideas to try with the kids while camping. I learned much about cooking actually in the coals and also using the dutch oven. I would reccomend this book to anyone new to camping or to intermediate campers who want to try new ideas.
5,A must have book,Book is excellent source for emergency preparedness. Skills and methods are well shown (drawings and photos) and well described. My dad came across the US in 1932 and spoke about many of the skills shown in this book (and some of the recipes). I am amazed how many ways to get along with a minimum of kit. A must have book.
4,Roughing It Easy: A Unique Ideabook for Campping and Cooking,"I rely on this book for information regarding outdoor activities with my Girl Scout Troop, whether it be cooking, teaching knots or planning an outdoor event."
3,mixed feelings,"What i recieved was a common flower stick set , not what is pictured, which was dissappointing but on good side its the most colorful one i got. Id recommend a place that handles their screw ups themselves, not passes u to the next"
3,They work,Kinda of cheap compared to the other set my son had but they were also 1/3 the price. He likes them though and that is all that counts.
2,Looks like a standard 6 volt power supply,This charger looks like a standard 6 volt power supply with alligator clips on the end .I highly recommend purchasing a multi stage charger instead. Unlike this item it will fully charge your battery and prevent it from over-charging.
4,Good Charger,I bought the charger to recharge my son's ride on toys. Recharges fisher price and other batteries without a problem.
3,Ok,It worked for a while and then it quick charging after several more charges. Ended up with a cheapie from walmart that works better.
1,Don't be swindled,The item I received from eComElectronics was not a Moultrie but a knock-off immitation. I did not open the box until after the return window had expired otherwise the piece of crap I received would be back on its way to China.
3,Very cheap charger....,"The charger does work as a 6 or 12 volt charger. This is the only positive thing I can say. The design is very cheap, no charge indicator light, no way of telling when the battery is fully charged. I had an actual charger from Moultrie that says ""Moultrie"" on it along with a charge indicator light. This one is Universal brand.View the Moultrie website to confirm what I'm saying: [...]Link for Moultrie charging instructions: [...]"
5,Awesome watch.,"This watch is so awesome. I love it and recommend it. It's really sharp. Amazon has unbelievable prices on the Movados. And to say another good word about Amazon -- I ordered this watch and it apparently got lost in the mail. The USPS told me it was delivered, but it never actually was. I contacted Amazon about this, and they immediately sent me another one, which arrived a couple days later. That is GREAT service. Thanks Amazon!"
5,Movado loyalist,"I've always liked the style and quality of the Movado brand, and the Amarosa did not disappoint me. I purchased the Amarosa for my girlfriend's birthday, and she is very happy with her birthday present. She needs to get it re-sized for her wrist, but other than that, it's a Movado."
5,"Beautiful watch, no signature","I echo the previous comments. This is a beautiful watch, very elegant, and the wife loves it. It's a bit big -- we had all of the links taken out, and it still fits a bit loose (though it is a bracelet watch). The price here is great. The warranty card is enclosed in the box, though not signed."
4,Best Price,Amazon had this for lower price than even the factory store of movada. I gave this as a gift my mom and she loved it! This is an awesome piece!
2,misrepresentation?,This watch is NOTHING like the picture whenI ordered it. The packaging is poor and the return address is distorted! I want to return it but do not know the entire address. What should I do?
4,"Pretty good, but not perfect.","I really like the look of it and it was fairly easy to get onto the phone following the instructions. There are a couple of minor annoyances. The external buttons are covered. You can still press them as long as you remember where they're at so I've gotten used to it. Also, a strip of screen is covered by the skin. Again, since I remember what it's covering up it hasn't hurt so far but still annoying. It gives you a much better grip on your phone so you don't drop it."
2,11 year old didn't like this book,"i didnt perticuarly like this book.vermeer is a great artist and they didnt put many illustrations of his work.it was very informative yet not a very good book, it was boring."
1,Item would have been good if ever recieved,I dont know what this perfume is like because I ordered it for my wife and have been waiting for weeks on end to receive it. But I was charged though.
1,Griffin Direct Deck Universal,Must be a problem with this purchase....The sound only comes through the right channel. I've tried it in two different cars with the same result. Cheap though.
4,Very good compared to an audio AUX,I was really pleased with the product and don't have much of a negative review towards it. Slight audio adjustment is required since every audio system in cars are different but overall satisfied with the purchase and will continue in the future to make purchase from this company.
3,Its Ok!,"This is the only cassette adapter that works in my car, However, the particular one that i bought did not last long!"
2,It works ...,"... but thats about it.It was loud and noisy while in my car player, and eventually I had to contort the wires (near where it plugs into my mp3 player) to get the bass to play at all.Replaced it with a belkin yesterday that seems waaaay quieter (about the same sound quality) but its too soon to tell."
1,Unusable,"I had the same experience as the reviewer who said the DirectDeck only played out of one side of the speakers. I bought TWO and both had the same problem. Normal volume on the left side, whisper quiet on the right."
1,Worst audio accessory I've every owned,Music playback is distorted with low volume level. Cassette often makes a horrible noise that creates an unbearable listening experience. This cassette adapter has no redeeming qualities.
2,Distorted Sound,"I picked this up at Walmart for fairly cheap since my original cassette adapter was starting to break down. I was impressed at how quiet it was in the tape deck but then when I started listening to music, I noticed that everything sounded distorted. It has to do with the resistor values in the adapter, so I am going to swap out the resistors with the ones from my old tape deck and hopefully that should fix the distortion problem. I would recommend looking for a better tape adapter."
1,destroyed my tape deck,"This thing destroyed my delco car stereo. It went in, and the stereo went on an endless rewind which made functioning impossible. It also wouldn't eject. To get it out, I had to destroy both the item, and damage the (no longer functioning anyway) car stereo. Cost me $100 for a new stereo. It would be more fun to inject beer into your stereo. The ensuing electrical fire might be fun to watch, and you won't be cursing ""griffin"" (whoever that is) for two hours, trying to get beer out of your radio."
1,terrible,This product had so much static i could not even listen to the music. Was very disappointed in it. will never buy again.
1,it was free and still not worth it.,"I ordered a Coby cassette adapter and they sent me this Griffin model instead. When I wrote the merchant back they told me to keep it and they would refund my money...Huh?.. I just want them to send me the model I ordered. The Coby has a replaceable cord and from past experience, it is always the cord or the jack that goes out. Anyway, until they send me what I ordered or refund my money, I figured I'd try out the Griffin anyway. I knew from the reviews that this thing was not going to work well. I was getting sound only from one side of my stereo and so I wiggled the jack and the sound started cutting in and out. I could never get a good clean sound from it. Junk for sure."
1,Wire comes apart and connector fails!,"This didn't last long, it shouldn't be hard to make a cable that can withstand riding around in a car... Not sure if there is a better way to play music from an iPhone to a 2002 Volvo, I wish they had a mini-stereo plug built in."
2,Music to you ears...kind of.,"I had a Griffin Cassette Adapter from 2007 that needed to be replaced. The cord and the jack had been smashed in my car's ashtray one too many times. I went to Target and they were priced at around $20. I only paid around $5 for it back in the day. I came to Amazon and found this product for $.01, that's a lot more appealing. The old adage ""You get what you pay for"" couldn't be more true in this situation. While it will still allow me to listen to my iPod in my car, the sound quality just isn't the same. On my previous Griffin Adapter you could hear all the different layers of the music tracks; this new adapter makes the music sound pretty ""blah"". I'm not sure if I have a defunct product or if the quality of Griffin's adapters has changed. Regardless, it's not bad for a penny - but I wouldn't pay much more for this particular product."
1,"Junk, not even worth a penny",I am ashamed to say that I was enough of a sucker to have gone through three of these cassette adapters. The sound quality was terrible and for some odd reason the cables split exposing frayed wiring that eventually breaks and severing the connections also the tape mechanisms constantly make clicking and snapping sounds while in operation. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Try Sony's adapters.
3,Not the best,"Thing finally broke on me. The wire coming off the jack split then severed. Cheap chinese proeuct. Buy the monster adapter casset, much better. Got a years work out of it though..."
1,Ejection Issues,"Bought this item from the Apple Store in the mall. Inserted it into my 2005 Toyota RAV4 L cassette deck. After about 7 seconds of noise, it ejected itself. Since the weather was cold that day, I waited until the heater kicked-in a little and inserted the cassette again. After about 7 seconds of noise, it ejected itself. Forty minutes later, almost at work now, I inserted the cassette again. After about 7 seconds of noise, it ejected itself. Can't recommend. Will return this to the Apple store."
3,MP3 Deck,The item came fast and secure but the sound quality on it really sucked i was hopeing it would of been better then what i thought but i would not buy it again but try a different way to stream my mp3s. Thanks
1,"Noisy, distorted, cheaply built","This is far from ideal for listening to your MP3s in a casette player at moderate volume levels, because the device is very noisy. It makes a very loud noise from its plastic gear system inside the casette. On top of that the sound quality is not converted over perfectly, and when the noise got excessively loud I removed the five small screws to try to clean things up inside the casette, but I quickly realized the problem is there is no internal architecture holding the gears in place--it's all based on a very weak level of tension when the casette is assembled. Kind of a joke, I'll be trying something else shortly."
4,Not too bad,"This is a good 1950's era monster movie. Like others have said, it does drag in a few places. It's from Republic Pictures, which you don't see many horror films from this company, usually war or westerns with John Wayne and such. It does have a scary breathing and loud heart beat when ever the monster is around. This film for me, was a lesser known of the genre so it intrigued me to get it. Good to get for the collection. Later"
1,Where have the good producers and directors gone?,"This is another example of the new penthouse video team emulating the old penthouse video team (with the good ones being between the two ""bad"" versions.)The look is definitely modern and sleek but it doesn't give you what you buy ""softcore"" for. I think a woman may have directed it.....or edited it.This would barely qualify for an ""R"" rating in theatres."
2,Abridged knock-off version,"This version is 221 minutes long. The version sold in the U.K. is 282 minutes long. (I confirmed the difference between the U.K. and U.S. versions by looking up the DVDs on the websites of the respective DVD production companies.) The U.K. version (i.e., the complete version) retails for about $20 on the U.K. Amazon website, so I suppose you get what you pay for."
3,It's How You Look At It???,"If you are a commerical R&B radio fan, this is not for you at all. This is for an open minded neo-soul, deep house, experimental crowd. It's a project of old school soul hits that is re-done by nu-soul artists and deep house producers. You can feel the spirit of expermentation on this complication. I personally really, really dig about three of the songs. To me it was what I was looking for at the price."
2,"SUCH POTENTIAL, SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT...","Although I'm a big fan of remix CDs and have many in my collection, this one's probably the worst I've ever come across. Of the few hits that are here, all of them have been stripped of whatever magic they had that made them hits in the first place. A smokin' funk instrumental jam such as ""Pick Up The Pieces"" deserves better than to be chopped up and re-assembled as one of the most annoying remixes you'll ever hear - chances are that you won't be able to stand more than a minute of the repetitive loop before you move on to the next track.If you really want a great remix CD, check out ""What Is Hip?"", a collection of classic Warner Brothers hits reworked by contemporary DJs who did an amazing job - unlike this buzzkill."
4,best in everything,"initially purchased for my toddler-maybe a little too advanced for him but he can grow with it.the colors,graphics and content are superb-my 4 yr old loves it and what a value-we can all share and play with-good family fun"
3,its ok not great,it is ok did not keep my sons attention. delivery was good . needs to be more fun & user friendly
4,A feast for the ears.,"Carboni does, indeed, make one feel as though one were living in Italy. This album places you right in the heart of Milano, bustling old-yet-new city that it is. Mondo is probably the best introduction to Carboni a listener can get--it's got a wide-range of styles and moods. There's probably a little something for everyone--and the multi-lingual lyric sheet can make the humor, anger, love and joy more personal to those who don't know Italian. Carboni is truly a wonderful musician, songwriter and singer."
5,Well my dog owns me!,Each page I turned in this book made me giggle because it perfectly described me. It is such a cute book. If your dog is your best friend you will completely recognize yourself on these humorous pages. This is a great book!
4,Good stuff,"Nice intense black mascara. It does dry out pretty fast, so you will only get about 3 months at the most."
1,SOUNDS LIKE THE LAST CD RELEASE JUST LOUDER AND MUDDIER,I just don't get it with all the technology man has now we can't get a simple Analog to Digital transfer right.If they don't have a great source tape then leave it alone with dignity.This sounds like they took the last exact CD release and just made it louder making it sound worse.As far as the remixes go they are really bad it sounds like Barry did some bad crack from beyond.I don't know if the original master tape even exits anymore if it does I'm hoping someone does it right. The original LP sounded better than the last two CD releases what a shame.
3,Size Chart Incorrect!,"The size chart on this page shows:Size: Medium (9-11), Large (10-13), XL (13-15)This is incorrect! I ordered Medium socks only to find the chart on the sock package to read that Medium is really (~4-8.5). I should have ordered large (9-11)! Fabric looks nice, but I will need to exchange."
4,good with my work boots,socks are awesome and good for your work boots. 4pairs for 20 bucks seems like a deal to me. upgrade your socks. these crew socks dont fall down around your ankles like cheap ones.
5,under armour socks,Thank you so much. They were perfect! We have already used them for games. They were exactly what he wanted.
5,Great for travel,"I have been looking for some crew socks that dry quickly so I can pack lightly. Cotton cushion or crew socks never dry in a hotel room. These socks dry within a day just hanging in the hotel bathroom. Combined with my other travel underwear, shirts and pants I only need to bring a three day supply for unlimited travel."
1,Tourniquet Tops,The lower portion of the sock is fairly comfortable. The ankle top is extremely tight. First use for a few hours (bike ride) left feet a mottled blue color with an indentation in the lower leg (I have no circulation/edema issues normally). Making a 3 inch cut in the top helped but may limit the life span of the sock. Designers losing touch?
3,A little too snug,"Although the socks are very well made, my husband finds them to be a little restrictive and tight in the leg."
5,Heatgear socks,"Great price on a great product. I work as a paramedic, so I have my work boots on for 12 hours at a clip. These heatgear socks keep my feet dry and fresh, and they are very comfy as well!"
4,Four and a half stars,"This short history of American colonialism was published posthumously by the author's sons and wife. It is an entertaining account about the lives of American people. The subjects covered include educational advancements, political and cultural relations with England, social consciousness, and religion. Besides dealing with the life or ordinary people, Schlesinger makes a point of relating interesting details about famous Americans. In particular, the author is attentive to Benjamin Franklin's productive life and John Adams' political ideas. While the length of the book does not allow for an indepth analysis of any of these subjects, Schlesinger paints a vivid portait of American colonial life."
2,AdSubtract ver 3 is Junk-ware!,"Pros: Previous versions of AdSubtract were great, performing as advertised.Cons: After purchase, the trail version of AdSubtract will not activate, remaining on trail status and then going dead after 30 days. (Online buyers have to download trail versions...which supposedly can be 'activated' after purchase...but won't activate.)Tech support is very poor: only emails that provide 'form' answers that do not solve the problem.After purchasing AdSubtract OVER 30 DAYS AGO, the product still will not activate. And the manufacturer will NOT issue a refund.WARNING...Intermute turned a great product into Junk-ware!"
5,SO Freakin' HOT!,This watch is ace. My boyfriend had a gold one and this one beats it. The two tone effect makes this watch really POP. He LOVED it for Valentine's Day.
5,heavy bowl,Really like this measuring bowl. I used it to bake cake for one year old birthday. Made a monkey head & baked nicely. Only negative it is very heavy. I am getting on in age & kind of hard for old lady to pick up when full.
3,Good for IT Tech who like to use the Web Admin Approach,"Only a 3. This book has some interesting topics about it, most has to do with Administering a Samba Server from the Web. Not from a Prompt. I was looking for more of a ""Tricks of the Trade"" kind of book. But this one does have some good points to it about web administering. But, what happens when the web is broke?You are going to SSH into the box and fix it from a prompt not from a Web Page. Otherwise this book IS GOOD but not GREAT!"
1,Totalmente Decepcionado,"Compre este libro e inmediatamente me dedique a su lectura, realmente es una decepción, las paginas que se pueden leer en la web para promocionar el libro no permiten visualizar realmente lo escaso de su contenido y de su profundidad.En una revisión previa alguien decia que si se era un comprador con estudios avanzados no deberia comprar este libro, sino mas bien una persona que esté trabajando en el tema. No estoy de acuerdo, este libro quizas sirva para una introducción brevissima del tema.Lo mas decepcionante son los apendices, excesivos en cantidad y pobres en contenido"
1,Misguided,"I bought this book because I thought that it would help me in my business. I was hoplessly wrong. This book offers nothing new and is completely worthless especially for readers bases outside the USA. I'm sure that Mr. Stroh is good at Transport and Logistics, but he is terrible at explaining them comprehensively."
3,some useful,"It gives information on the brokering business.It also appears that parts of the book are well behind the times, the latest copyright was in 2006. Some parts show a great deal of detail while others just seemingly are glanced over. The figures are difficult to read and understand, they are also at the end of each chapter and it's difficult to read the text and look at the figures (which are hard to read themselves)."
4,A readable guide to Eastern meditation,"Based on lectures at an extended Buddhist Meditation retreat, the book is very readable and suggests discipline easily applied even in today's busy world."
4,Insightful meditation book for several levels of practice,"The author covers many basic points and instructions on insight (Vipashyana) meditation. This type is employed in many different sects/schools of Buddhism. His instruction is practical, and the book includes questions/answers that can be helpful to the practitioner. It's nicely done too. He also provided a very fine and useful quote for my collection: ""People are attached to their own way of looking at things. As soon as you say something that in any way threatens it, they become defensive. So the way is not to threaten, just to be the way you are, letting the Dharma unfold. A peaceful mind has its effect on its surroundings. It takes time and it takes patience, and a lot of love."" Thus, the author blends warmth and practicality. Not an easy task."
5,A classic guide to insight meditation,"This classic by Joseph Goldstein has been the the book that launched a thousand meditators in this particular style of meditation -vipassana meditation, which is central to the Buddhist path of purification of the mind and heart. In many ways this book heralds the beginning of the Mindfulness Movement in America, which is an exciting development in modern non-dogmatic spiritual development. To learn more about mindfulness, I recommend ASIN:1432736884 The Path of Mindfulness Meditation."
2,Great idea--poor execution,"This book is definitely needed in the field of historic preservation; however, this edition is so poorly executed that I would advise against purchasing it, particularly at the full retail price... The Figures are sometimes mislabelled, and the descriptions of them within the body of the text often do not match what is actually diagrammed. The photographs are all black and white, and are frequently too dark to demonstrate the architectural feature being described. I found the errors very distracting, not to mention disconcerting in what purports to be ""the most complete and expert resource you can find."" I believe Mr. Irwin has written a valuable book, but I wish I had waited for the second edition."
1,I liked her when she was country....,"The country songs on here are great. Her first two albums were awesome, traditional, country masterpieces.Then, she changed her image with ""I Hope You Dance"", got rid of the twang and the country, and went for a pop sound and a sleazy, Brittany Spears floozy look. Unfortunately, that song was a big hit. But, fortunately, the follow up didn't sell well at all. Give the Dixie Chicks credit, they restored interest in a more-traditional sound, and nobody was interested in a country singer trying to imitate a pop singer anymore. Maybe LeAnn will go back to country now.Anyway, she looks like a bona fide psycho on the cover. What happened to that cute, country girl on the first two album covers? She looks like she's about to kill someone on this album cover. Yuck.Bottom line: By the first two Womack albums and save your money on this one."
4,4.5 stars for one of the better country stars out there,"I'm not a big fan of modern country. I'd rather listen to Willie Nelson, Cash, and Merle anyday. However, I really enjoy this DualDisc. Take a listen to her voice and sample the tracks to this album and you'll see for yourself.Like other Dualdiscs, the video portion of this DualDisc is somewhat limited. It's not a concert DVD. But if you have a DVD-Audio capable player, you'll get to enjoy high resolution audio. And that's what it is meant for. As long as you have a surround sound system, this album will provide you with much enjoyment for years to come."
4,Good country,"This album has a good assortment of Lee Ann Womack's hits. She is a smooth as ever with just enough twang to remind you it's country music. The dual disc offers the wonderful option of seeing a few of her videos. This one actually has several music videos. It's almost as good as getting a music DVD. If you're a fan or just like some of her songs, this is a good choice."
2,A Little Lost,"""Scared to Live"" is the seventh in a series of crime novels by Steven Booth, following detectives Diane Fry and Ben Cooper. This is my first time reading the series and I found Sergeant Fry and Cooper to be an enjoyable team to follow. The story however falls flat with an overabundance of imagery, creating page after page of detail on something you don't even care about. The story itself is far fetched, and with each page the story becomes more absurd. I wanted to like this book, the characters were interesting and I found myself intrigued with their development. Booths desire, however, to add unnecessary words and develop dubious ideas lost me somewhere in the middle of this five hundred page summer read."
3,Wait... You can buy ALL episodes for the same money!!!,This is an OLD release. WHY buy it when you can buy the COMPLETE collection for only $30 more???
5,Terrific from start to finish!,"My child is now two. He gets up and interacts with this video by making the various shapes with his hands, as Puppy Dog in the video instructs. This video is highly participatory, encouraging children to be active not passive. Very good. I highly recommend getting this video."
3,Noisy pump,"I purchased this pump to in hopes that it would be quieter than the one I had already, plus I needed a bit more power. This pump delivered the power as advertised but it is very noisy. I wrote to the company and got a prompt reply. They tried hard to help me and sent me a new impeller to try. The new impeller didn't fix the problem. I switched to a pump made by Lifegard called ""Quiet One."""
3,Has soul - but no cigar,"The content of the book is great, only a little short and condensed. I wish more examples were available. Also I wish sometimes author would approach a topic from different angles, instead of leaving us behind after plowing through something...Very poor print quality and layout, the colored pages are FALLING OUT from the book. Definitions are not always apparent and it is difficult to discern important parts in the book. Graphs are ""grayscale"" and are also of very poor quality.I guess this is all due to the book being old, and it is printed on-demand, as shows in the font/typeface - which looks like it's been ""xeroxed""."
5,Zungguzunagazeng Catch !t !!!!,I just bought this album right after purchasing 'Mister YellowMan' this album is off the charts this YellowMan guy is a serious bad@ss all I can say is buy this if you don't to bad for you 'this album along with 'Mister YellowMan' need to be heard from PA system with bass heavy or in your car full blast with bass heavy if you dont know how to dance you will have learned midway through this album haha!! I like how YellowMan say Zungguzenggugguzung Cacth !t like if it is something physical you can reach and grab awesome stuff !!!
4,Some of the best of American Hippie Cooking,"I love American Hippie food. I don't at all mean that as an insult. It's homey, nutricious, delicious and often surprising and fun cuisine.Some of my favorite recipes are here: Vegetable Lo Mein, the enchilada recipes, and lentil soup.Definitely an addition to your cookbook shelf, health and happiness."
4,Los espejos de America,"La inmigracion a los Estados Unidos es el fenomeno demografico mas contundente de la historia. El camino de Sur a Norte que emprenden diariamente multitudes colmadas de frustraciones y de esperanzas esta cambiando el rostro de America. Debemos decir por ello que el tema abordado por Jorge Ramos es el tema mas apasionante de nuestro tiempo.Con sencillez de periodista y con la honestidad de quien es tambien un inmigrante, nos entrega una vision que muchos desconocian. No hay una pretension literaria sino puramente periodistica, y por eso creo que para tener una vision completa yo recomendaria leer junto a este libro ese fenomeno editorial que es ""Los suenos de America"" de Gonzalez Viana, que aqui en NYC es el segundo o tercer libro mas leido en espanol."
1,RAMOS ruins his own credibility as a journalist,"Jorge's defense of Spanglish is very backwards and I find it strange that a respected journalist such as himself would give in to defending the inability to speak correct Spanish and at the same time, putting down the Real Academia.This certainly not the view of the majority who view Spanglish as a contamination of Spanish through English.Spanglish is basically the language of impoverished Hispanics, many of them who are almost illiterate in their own mother tongue and the reason for Spanglish's rise within the EE.UU. is beacause they lack a proper vocabulary and education in Spanish and the ability to adapt to the changing culture that surrounds them in the EE.UU.Fortunately what saves this book is Ramos's defense of undocumented workers."
5,Yum!,"I love most of Kernel Seasons popcorn toppings. This one is great, it tastes just like you would expect. It is really good by itself or,if you want, mix it with caramel on popcorn. It is also good on apples."
4,A little odd but good,"Not everyone thinks of popcorn as a sweet spice product. This was really odd for me. I think the flavor is very good. I prefer this sprinkled on apples. I can see this on oatmeal and other foods, not just popcorn.If you have a hard time with cinnamon on popcorn then try other food items with this shaker. I think you will agree that the overall flavor is really good, even if popcorn is not your food of choice."
5,Cuts dwn on cleaning,Im a franchisee with 7-11. We recently had new floors installed and they are the worst. My employees spent more time cleaning the floors then with customers. This product works great. HUGE front mopping surface and it makes the work time cut in half.
4,Works for me...,"I installed this vent on a pickup fiberglass topper which I converted into a simple camping setup. It has handled a few years and several trail/camping trips so far pretty well. I have been careful to keep it closed when around tree branches.I do need to be sure it is closed with some tension on it...other wise it will open up and cause a lot of air drag on the highway. I used some foam under the back of the lid to keep it open about 1/2"" all the time to allow some ventilation while it was closed down with tension on the foam."
3,Detailed but odious work,"This isn't a thriller and it can be very dry and tiresome at times. However, from the academic standpoint , this is an interesting work on the CIA.Good or bad, this book was a product of its times, and I understand that. It wasn't fashionable in the 1970s to spy, and there were some controls needed on CIA.However, I think Agee goes too far in releasing secrets.Agee takes the reader through recruitment, training and CIA life. If he had stopped there and left out designations, cover and agent names it would be a sort of dry but informative work.He didn't.Aldrich Ames sold names and operations for money to the Soviet Union. Phil Agee sold them to a book publisher. I see little difference."
5,fascinante,"Fascinante relato de un joven en su viaje por el mundo en una epoca de vias precarias; con carencia de dinero; impulsado por su espiritu aventurero, con afan de conocer, experimentar y aprender de otros pueblos y culturas. Con una narracion amena, y con las experiencias vividas, deja ensenanzas y consejos y a su vez, capta la atencion del lector mas exijente. Quiero resaltar, la forma positiva de referirse a cada pais, aun de aquellos en donde tuvo dificultades. Este libro ensena que nada es imposible cuando se persevera en su busqueda."
5,Un Nuevo Martin Fierro by Carlos A. Caggiani,"This book is very well written; I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a book that can be read over and over again and still feel that I am reading it for the first time but with a renewed spirit of exhilaration about the worldly exploits that it depicts. It is an account told in poetry format of travel adventures as they relate to life experiences during these travels. I would further say that if someone is thinking of traveling, this book should be put on the list of recommended travel books. It really brings the reader to a higher plateau; I can say this with all certainty because it brought me to this plateau. Thank you so much for the quick delivery as well. Cordially, Olga Bean"
1,don't waste your money,"i regret even renting this game. it is NOT an rpg. it is NOT entertaining. this is a third rate fighting game with lame moves and an even lamer ""character upgrade"" system. the fighting system is boring as are the fights you get into. even the graphics are substandard. this game should have been released for the super nes"
1,not a rpg by any means,"a classic fighter along the lines of fur fughters etc. The onle rpg quality i found was in the narration, Its slow and a dud and thats its good quality"
2,Not worth it,"Ok here's the game in short and sweet terms. WEAK! I don't even begin to understand how some people say its another classic game like Baldurs Gate or Gauntlet. its NOTHING like them, and for Titus to market it as an RPG is just plain rediculous. This has no adventuring of ANY kind although you can customize and power up your guy along the way, but the repetetive and boring combat just doesnt make up for it in the least. IF you rent this game play it with a friend or two, that is the ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one. Otherwise don't waste your time with it."
2,"Fun to rent, not to buy","This is a fun game for the first day or so. It had a lame story line. The graphics were okay, but I think they could have done a lot better job. The fighting system is what brought it's rating down. It was kind of boring, and it was the same thing every time you fought, and don't be mistaken for it's miss advertising. IT IS NOT AN RPG. It is far from one, too. I guess if you like games like tekken, then this would be a good game for you, but like I say, ""fun to rent, not to buy."""
1,A terrible game,"This game is HORRIBLE.There is no story really,no interaction with NPC's.Actually ther are NO NPC's in this damned game.Their is no world to explore,no adventure to go on,just Really Insanely hard battles that you can't win.I HATE this game."
1,Not RPG Game,"Very disappointing! I was expecting to get an RPG game in the vein of FFX when I purchased this game, but that is not the case. This is a fighting game (alot like Tekken series) with a bit of story telling before each fight sequence. Horrible, horrible!!!"
5,Touches the Heart,"An excellent film by Anand Tucker, Hillary and Jackie takes the viewers in an emotional and musical journey into the lives of the Du Pre sisters. It shows the story from two perspectives, making the characters three-dimensional and it really helps the viewers understand the motivations for each of the main characters' actions. Excellent acting by Emily Watson as well as her co-actors. The writer and editor deserve praises too."
4,"It's hard being the ""good kid""","Coming from a family of musicians, I know that sometimes creative people can think that they are above conventional morals, that general rules (like marital fidelity) don't apply to them.Isn't it sad how the stable, the level-headed kid in the family is expected to be compassionate and understanding? This is the cross that Hilary takes upon herself when her sister Jackie develops psychological problems. When Jackie starts sleeping with Hilary's husband, Hilary makes no attempt to confront either one of them. Because Hilary is no longer performing, being a wife and a mother, she thinks of herself as inferior to her famous sister. She just swallows the hurt and crawls into her children's bed. That act was very symbolic. She was denouncing her womanhood and devoting herself 100% to motherhood."
1,this movie is all wrong,"I'm sorry to all of you people who feel like this is a good movie. It's not. This is an absolutely terrible movie. I'm a cellist myself studying at a conservatory of music and Jackie is my cello idol. This movie portrays her terribly and Emily Watson, who is attempting to imitate Jackie playing, does a terrible job. If you really want to see what Jacquelin du Pre was like, then go buy an actual biographical video of her that they have here at amazon.com or you can go to sharmusic.com. I'm sorry, but this was an absolutely terrible movie and any cellist that knows anything about Jackie will agree."
1,Gravely disappointing,"I just didn't buy the premise of this movie, painting Hilary as long-suffering and Jackie as capricious. There was very little indication of what made her the great musician that she was. The whole family was a little sick, but I think Hilary was the really certifiable one. I have always loved Emily Watson, but this performance was not among her best. The mimed cello playing was unconvincing. The fox-like Rachel Griffiths had some moving scenes, but this seemed like a self-serving attempt of an ordinary soul to ""set the record straight"" about her brilliant sister. The movie also suffered from inept concert sequences and the usual misguided cinematic attempts to portray the life of classical musicians. The whole thing left a profoundly sour taste in my mouth. Why not look at a video of Du Pre performing to cleanse the palate?"
2,dissapointed,for years I have been using Amazon for books and videos and have never beem dissapointed but this time I was.The DVD was advertised as only being used once. That gives the impression that it was in perfect con dition when actually it was covered with scratches and the case was split around the edges.I only give it two stars because it at least did arrive on time.Ray Hartland
5,Great Movie!,"I wanted to see this movie for a long time just because of the title. I had no idea who Jacqueline Du Pre was until I saw this film and now I am totally enthralled in her life. This film was brilliantly filmed telling each of their lives separately. The strongest love of all can be the love of two sisters and this movie showed us just that. If you want to see an excellent drama, see this."
5,beautiful and evocative,"This is an outstanding portrayal of two sisters who share a love of music and each other. The bond between them was brilliantly portrayed by Emily and Rachel and they should both have won Oscars.I did not know very much about Jaqueline's real life prior to this movie so I cannot comment on any factual discrepancies. All I can say is that the movie moved me and the story told is easily as tragic as that in Shine. The pressure put upon young musicians who show extraordinary talents is well displayed, and the scenes where Jackie is playing away from home to huge audiences but has no-one to support her, tear at the heartstrings almost as much as the brilliant Cello playing.I would recommend this movie to all musicians or anyone who loves music. It demonstrates that the truly great musicians do not just appear, they give their whole lives over to the art"
4,Functional as a calendar and teaches me new knitting stitches,"Perfect, not a book that will languish somewhere in my home: a functional product that doubles up as a calendar and it will force me to look at the stitches. I have borrowed plenty of books thinking I would look at the stitches and actually try some out: the books get returned to the library and I may have only looked at it once. This is just the perfect kinda forum for me to learn a new stitch! I am self taught knitter, so at first glance, some stitches look doable, but therer is a reference section for all the short hand if you need it (and. I will need it).One less star is that I wish somehow one could put the day of the week on it! Harsh request, but otherwise a perfect product and much cheaper than a vogue hardback stitch dictionary!"
5,Wonderful item to purchase!!!,"I love this calendar, you learn a stitch a day, and you can make different patterns. I enjoys looking at different stitches thinking of what I can make using the different stitches. It also show you how to do certain stitches."
3,Errata page for the first two editions,"I don't have this book (yet!) but someone in a knitting community that I'm part of posted this link <http://www2.martingale-pub.com/Information/Corrections/C108_cor.htm> to an errata page for the first and second editions. Apparently there are quite a few mistakes in the patterns for serveral of the days, so if you have the first or second edition, you may want to check the link out."
2,frustrating,"Half of all the patterns I've tried in this book have errors. Some are obvious, and you can easily see that the pattern won't work. Some are not, and you spend time ripping out and trying again only to finally realize it's not you, it's the book. One reviewer says there is an errata page. I've got to find it. Love the idea of the book, because I like to do little samples to pass the time rather than invest major commitment to a big project. But this book is so frustrating with all its errors, that it's ruining my fun."
5,Great for new projects,I am enjoying this calendar. It keeps me knitting. I even bought two more for fiends.
2,january 1 basket rib,hard to understand for me when it says multiple of 2 + 1. how do I know how many to cast on?
5,365 knit patterns,"We all need a calendar to keep our days straight. What better way than with one that also gives you a different knitting stitches each and every day?This 6"" x 5"" stand-up desk calendar begins with a list of abbreviation definitions. You know, things like K = Knit and yf = yarn forward. It continues with a list of Special Instructions such as the definition of Cable 3 left and Cross 2 right.Now you actually begin the year. Each day has a color photo of a knitted swatch and a knit pattern. January 1st is Basket Rib. It gives you the directions for creating the Basket Rib pattern. You can use this calendar again and again as there are no days of the week given, just the month and day.If you work it right, you can make several Afghans out of just trying your hand at each stitch by creating squares of the same size. Then just whip stitch them together into an afghan. With 365 different squares, you will be able to have several ready to give by next Christmas!"
3,"Great content, frustrating construction","I love the idea of this calendar and the content. The pictures make me want to pick up my needles and start creating. I've used countless patterns from it.The only reason I gave it such a low rating is because I've owned two and both have fallen apart. The way the wire rings (more of a C shape really)are designed you have to balance it just right so pages don't start falling off the wire. And then the next day when you turn the page you do it all over again - pages fall off, you finagle them back on and then try to get it to stand up without losing more pages. If the company could make a better ring design I'd give it 5 stars."
2,"great photos of pattern, but don't buy it.","I bought this book because I loved the photos of the different stitch patterns and all my other knitting are packed away for moving. After trying several patterns, I got frustrated. Even at the initial part of a pattern, you can see the direction will not work out. I am so disappointed with this book."
2,Somewhat dissapointed!,"I found this group under the Scotlands celtic category. So I bought it! Wheres the Celtic? Other then the lead song (Urlar), they sounded more like a part russian part french pop rock band. I wasn't completly dissapointed though. ""Only the brave"" and ""Alba"" get my nod but make me cringe to think ""This band considers themselves Celtic?"""
3,never got it to pair up,waste of time and money ended up spending $450.00 for an alarmwant to send it back wonder if it is too late
1,Did not work!!!,"This item did not work, I tried did not get it to work. I took it to a shop and no one there could get it to work either."
1,Do not buy !!,"I tried and tried to get the thing to work to no avail ! I looked online for more instructions , put new batteries , the fob just dosent work . I'm going to return it ."
1,doesn't work,"Ordered 2 units, one works fine the other (identical) doesn't. Changed battery etc, still nothing, price was great but considering one of two doesn't work it cost twice as much"
2,"Sad, Pitiful, Bill Bellamy could have done much better......","If you want to see how the average young black man gets as much a** as he can in one day, get this film. Bill Bellamy could not have went to Rutgers University to put out Bulls**t like this. Bernie Mac is the only one in this film that's funny. This should be popular with the BET crowd."
1,"This is so not funny, the only good thing is the women","This movie has got to be the least funny movie ever!Hey even Master P's ""I GOT THE HOOK-UP"" was 10 times as funny.The thing is there exist no plot, they have pretty much stolen the story from Martin Lawrence's ""A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE & HATE"" but then taken out the part that the female is a psycho so Nothing happens!The only good part is the women but u can see that elsewhere u don't need to buy this to see that!I rate it 0/5"
1,A disgrace.,"I can't believe that someone actually made a movie about how many women a guy could sleep with and get away with it. This movie is absolutley awful, and it should be thrown off all of the video shelves. There is so much cussing that anyone should be embarassed to watch it. There is zero substance to this movie."
2,he aint a Playa,"This film promises to be good but only when you see it at the video store. First of all Bill Bellamy aint no playa!! The guy is ugly. Secondly he hasnt got the playa characteristics, the role does not suit him. They need a real playa like me, but as I wasnt asked they shouldve got Martin Lawrence. Wouldve been better if the the Playa was someone else. But I gotta say the babes are sexy!"
4,fun when you have friends around,"yeah this movie is one of those movies you watch when you have friends over that think they relate to such behavior. i watched it more than once and i'll watch it again. funny,chicks are nice!! nothing much if your looking for a plot, but a fun flick to watch."
5,The Kettles in the Ozarks,The movie came in great condition and got it quicker then I thought I would. I'm glad I can go to Amazon for all my classic movies
4,good read,"I did not know if I would like this book after reading the negative reviews. However, I am glad I did. Wicca is a new religion that is a reconstruction of various traditions and ideas. The strength of Wicca is one of perspective. By being able to look back across time, one can draw conclussions and build concepts that draws a line of deaper truth. This book seems to do just that. While there are historical inaccuracies in this book, I am sure, there is also deep wisdom. What I enjoyed about this book was the way it discussed the faery. It elevated them from the rediculous new age role of plant pixy and place them in broader spiritual context. Those who did not like this book I suspect were non wiccan pagans or those looking for historical references to the Celtic world. If you are not a Wiccan, then this book is probably not for you. If you are looking for a way to relate to Faery world, this is not a bad start."
2,New Age Witchcraft poorly rooted in history.,"Sound ideology for a New Age, but this and the second volume present romantisized views of the past as researched history. If you remove all the false historical claims, this is an ok book, but they do serve to hinder anyone with more than a highschool education."
1,Little less than kin,"This is a sweet, large-type, teen-age book. It does not deal with the hard-core issues of the magical traditions. If you are in need of some soul searching quiet time, the meditations contained within are just right. It will pinch your intrest in finding out more about the traditions of the faery, yet it lacks a firm grounding in truth and the art of magick"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Don't waste your money on this incredible waste of paper, filled with regurgitated and garbled bits and pieces of older, more reputable works on Faery, Druidry and Wicca. In addition, it's an excruciating task to actually READ this book - wading through all the spelling, grammatical and word usage errors. Was the Publisher's editorial staff all on strike or something when this book was being processed? Save Money, Save Trees, Don't Bother!"
1,New world foods in an old world craft?,"Well, it doesn't take much to realize that these books (I'm including volume 2) aren't worth the paper they're printed on. If this is an authentic old world tradition, as Stepanich claims, then why does it include crops like potatoes, pumpkins, and corn in the rituals, crops that were not even discovered by Europeans until 1492."
2,The extremes ...,"If you notice the reviews they fall in either the five star (inspired word of the goddess herself) or the one star (this stuff is complete trash). It almost seems like either her best friends or worst enemies are posting them. I, myself, found the work more imaginative than informed or inspired. I think the works of R.J. Stewart and John and Caitlin Matthews are better presented and more interesting."
5,Just wonderful,"I have both Faery Wicca books and the tarot cards. I LOVE them. I have found them inspiring and personal. Every question I have is answered chapter by chapter. For critics I ask - which Faery Faith are you talking about, which aspect of Wicca are you talking about? The Celtic countries stretched from Ireland to the old Eastern block countries (eg. Czech Republic). Kisma does well to extract from a wide source of information (ALL referenced mind you!)information most relevant to Irish Celtic Paganism. I am saddened by the harsh words and the attacks. As with anything, take a look at these books and see for yourself, if they speak to you, you will find them intense and full of passion. I have found them life changing."
3,pretty good,"I didn't find it to be as easy a read as some other books on Wicca that I've read, but it's still packed with information."
3,A magical text,Screw all u jerks and your critical reviews.This book is poetry.Write your own damm book .
1,Shameless,"I've never seen how this writer can attract so many attention with these books. Her teachings can be everything less irish faery oral tradition. The celts never used pentacles, they didn't commemorate eight festivals only the four solar ones. But what is more strange the author doesn't accept solitary practice. It is ridiculous since most of the druids were solitary ones. This book is no more than a wicca book, if you want to know more about the celtic and druid magic there's one called Sacred Fire of Ian Corrigan that's a good one."
1,Oh my... another flake......,"Don't even waste your money on this book or its companion volume. Poorly researched, more fantasy fiction than Craft, and it can lead a true seeker of the Ancient Arts on a wild goose chase for the Goddess and the Ancient Ones. The lore is at best grade school level, and it is written for the lowest common denominator of buyer.... do you really want to sink that low. You would do much better to save your money and buy a reputable book on the Craft and the Wiccan faith."
3,On the Fence With This One,"The first thing anyone considering this book should know is that most (though not all) of the historical claims in this book are either poorly researched or just plain made up. This is important. The ancient Irish people did not practice the religion ""revealed"" in this book (though they certainly had a religion). This book is certainly not about any ancient religion.That being said, it can be used as a guide to a spiritual path. It's just important that everyone understand it's shortcomings. I really believe that the author would have been better off saying, ""Hey, I created this from a varity of sources, it works for me, and maybe you'll enjoy it too."" If she'd done this, it really might have had a chance."
1,Metal? Hardly.,"Looking high and low for real brass handheld, thought I found it (Material: Metal), but alas, it is plastic. It may include some metal, but this is plastic and it is being returned."
2,Not compatible with Rubbermaid Fasttrack rails.,"I just received this today and it doesn't fit on the Rubbermaid Fasttrack garage storage system. It actually appears to be for the Rubbermaid garage system 300x - the predecessor to Fasttrack. I suppose I can still affix it directly to the wall, but its rather disappointing. I didn't realize Rubbermaid had different, incompatible garage organization systems."
5,4 port USB slot adapter,"Plugs right into the extra USB connectors on the motherboard.4 more useful USB connectors.Rectangle, 5 pins on one side 4 on the other, one is plugged so you can't plug it in wrong."
3,"Excellent seller, good product but better modified","Received two days after order, with regular shipping. Product is good but I had to replace one round head screw with a flat head in order for it to fit my Antec case."
4,Works but have one wish,The product works as described but I wish someone made these in a color other than beige. All of the other wires in my case that can be seen through the side window blend in except these. How about making these in black at least?
2,Too long for slot,The actual metal plate that mates with the back of the chassis was much too long for my case (Silverstone TJ08-E). I had to do major surgery and mate it with another PCI slot cover to get it to fit in the slot. So far it is working now that it is mounted. If it had fit in my case without modification I would have given it five stars.
2,kinda flaky,Not that impressed with this. The pin header seems too short to make a good connection with the pins on the motherboard and the connection drops out occasionally. I found a different product which works better.
2,"Ports quality seems good, one screw on the plate is a blocker.","One of the (inner-most) screw prevents the slot plate from sliding into position perfectly. I was able to gently put the screw in place but could not turn it all the way in. It leaves a small gap between the cabinet and the plate. Hopefully the plate does not slide out of position while attaching/detaching the usb cable.The port quality is good, connecting the pins to the board was fine."
3,Works well and affordable but bracket is too long and screws stick out,The StarTech.com 4 Port USB A Female Slot Plate Adapter (USBPLATE4) does what it's supposed to do. Cables were long enough for my motherboard and case but might not be for everyone. I was disappointed that the bracket is a bit longer than I expected and that (at least in my case) the lower round head screw interferes with installing it cleanly. Another reviewer replaced the screw with a flat head screw but I just forced it into place. Even though it took 5 min to install that was 4 minutes longer than expected than something like this that should be as simple and as straightforward as installing a slot cover.
3,Large cover but color is not white,"I needed this cover plate to cover a dead outlet. The one I got from my electrician did not cover the entire gang box and it just looks bad with paint chips around it.So I figured I will try a Leviton one, since all of my outlets are Leviton.This cover is large enough to cover the hole, larger than the one the electrician put on, but there is one problem with it - it is NOT white!The bag has a sticker on it that says white, but it is almond color. It's annoying, because everything else in the house is white. However, if you don't mind that, it does the trick."
5,Bitchin' Party Album,"Autoamerican is the one album with Deborah Harry that brings back exciting memories of the good ol' party days in Hermosa Beach. My roommate Stacey Flett always loved to party with this album turned up LOUD. Favorite track: Rapture with Lenny Pickett and the Tower of Power horn section. Two versions of Rapture. One is called the disco mix, the other is the original. Stacey if you're reading this get in touch. I hope the yayo didn't get ya."
3,"Movie is ok, DVD is not as promising...","If you are deciding to buy this... the advice I can give you is buy it if you are truly a fan of Hugh Laurie, it's a nice movie to add to your collection. Despite the fact that this movie is not Ben Elton's best work, but, I think you will get the kicks out of seeing Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson, and not to mention, Rowan Atkinson, because these people are the reason why the movie is so alive and entertaining. Otherwise, the movie is so-so. Now to the DVD itself; this DVD version is highly-edited, I know that some scenes in the beginning of the movie are left out. I'm, somewhat disappointed with it. I guess you buyers can decide for yourself if it's worth buying, I hope this helps"
1,Barely funny at all,"Okay, I like British rom-coms as much as the next person, but this one was just tasteless and stupid. I like Joelly Richardson, but she was just annoying here. I like Hugh Laurie, but he couldn't save it. And if I ever walked into a clinic that contained such scary staff as Rowan Atkinson's gyneacologist or Dawn French's deranged nurse, I would walk right out again immediately.We are not spared the tiniest detail of Hugh and Joelly's bid for a baby, and in some cases, a little information goes a long way. Besides, Joelly's character would make a horrible mother; she's so paranoid and possesive. Also, she constantly whines to her husband that he'd rather be having sex with Cameran Diaz, which is a stupid thing to say given that she has more than a passing resemblance to Diaz herself. The best thing about this lame and squirmy movie is the ever-watchable Tom Hollander, who hams it up nicely with a preposterous Scottish accent as Ewan Proclaimer, a hilarious director."
4,"Not at all like House, but great for old fans of Laurie's real accent","A mostly-forgotten Hugh Laurie movie from a decade ago, which I missed then like everyone else in the world. (Even though I'd been trying to catch his stuff sincePeter's Friends, if notBlack Adder Goes Forth.) Laurie plays a screenwriter for not-the-BBC, and secretly turns his own wife's fertility drama into a comedy -- the ending runs off the rails for a while, but otherwise it's so good that you'll wonder why it was so forgotten."
2,Inconsistent and politically correct,"The first half of this movie starts out promising; the 2nd half is not so good.It becomes slowly predictable and stereotypical, whereas it started out charming and promising.Of particular annoyance is the ending, where we find the hackneyed politically-correct stereotype of the husband having to admit culpability for all the wrongs of the couple's separation, and the woman never having to admit her half of the bargain, despite the fact that she was clearly as poor a communicator as he.Indeed, the wife's character is strikingly uneven in this movie: her personality appears to be one thing in the first half of the movie, but she seems to become a whole different person by the second half. Quite inconsistent."
1,An Abomination,"I adore Hugh Laurie. House is one of my favorite TV shows and I loved his portrayal of Bertie Wooster. So I ordered this sight unseen. HL's in it, it's gotta be great, right? Wrong. The ""humor"" is grotesque and unfunny and the story is totally unsatisfying. What a waste of Emma Thompson, too. I think this is the worst British movie I've ever seen."
2,Not quite as expected,"I did not expect any underlines in this book but there are quite a few. Had I known, I wouldn't have purchased this book because I need to make my own underlines for my own purposes. I think the book was misrepresented."
4,A cult classic that remains both interesting and groundbreaking.,"Originally released in 1979, ""Walking On Sunshine"" was the album that brought Eddy Grant the closest to mainstream success at this point in his career. His unique blend of Reggae, R&B, Funk, Soca and indigenous African rhythms was truly on point here and Grant's visionary genius shines through on all nine tracks. Although no one could have guessed (back then) that Eddy Grant would become a superstar just four years down the line ""Walking On Sunshine"" set the stage for what was to come."
5,"If fiction intimidates you, use this book to light your way.","Good sense of humor on serious subjects. The author describes what fiction does and why we should care about it. Maybe he's a critic, but he's really just someone who thinks and writes clearly about literature. Really articulate. Lots of verbal flourish. The Woolf and Sebald essays are keepers, sort of like Fiction 101."
5,repetitive to say...but brilliant,"Criticism for people who want to read something smart and insightful about books. It's a book for those who appreciate thinking long and deep about literature, who appreciate being introduced to aspects of language and content they may never have previously considered, who take literature seriously and feel no need to apologize for it. There simply is no critic writing today as consistently well about literature as Mr. Wood and this book is a perfect introduction to why he has acquired such a reputation at such a comparatively young age. You may find yourself disagreeing but you will be forced to think hard as to why."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"Ordinary Sinner, was not a bad film nor did it meet its potential. The production quality was good as was the sound quality. The acting was actually OK, Martinez stood out as the priest and was the most connected with the viewer. The issue with this film was that it was a bit slow and forced. The other leads had no connection with the viewer and when they tried to be dramatic, you could see it but not feel it. The script was good but did not get you drawn in to the story as well as it should have. The coming out scene of the priest was the finest moment in the film, it was the most powerful and at that piont you did feel involved but it lost me shortly after that scene. Overall it was not bad but also not a movie you would invite your friends over to see. I would suggest renting it if you can and see if you like it enough to spend the money to buy.This was not a great investment but is worth a look. You may want to see the movie "" Priest""."
1,Sad Bad and Not good to know...or see.,"Not so ordinary. It is FREAKIN BAD. Where is the gay twist? A Matinez is a priest - he is gay, but he is not the main character. He has a 'friend' - cool. Also not the focus. Peter is a former divinity student who comes to rural Vermont to sort out crisis of faith and gets involved in a triangle with pal Alex and Rachel. Sounds cool...sounds sexy...is NOT. There IS no real triangle...Alex wants there to be but Peter doesn't know that...until Alex tries in a wishy-washy, why-even-bother way. A Martinez, the priest, gets more action...and we don't see that either. Then Alex tries to ensure he gets Peter by getting rid of the main competition...who is not who you would think really. Could have been good - wasn't. What it was? Slow, bad, disappointing. Not a first rate thriller as the cover purports - maybe a first rate coaster for your coffee. This is like crap on a stick, you shouldn't touch it...it STINKS."
4,Small treasure for those who love Solid Pleasure,The second of the two Ralph albums is more mild than Solid-P but just as far out there. The quality of the recording isn't as good as the others but you will find their most creative moments here.
5,"Try it, buy it!","In this album Yello goes back to the roots. The style of the album is quite minimalistic (these are really ""songs"", not ""tunes""), but I find it fascinating. Some of my all-time-favourite electronic music is on this record. Just listen to ""She's got a gun"" and ""Pinball Cha Cha""! By the way, there is a tremendous remix of ""She's got a gun"" on ""Eccentrix""."
4,"no benton, good thing","Too bad some people think Mr. Benton is on this, he's not here, thats why this is one of the good Vital Remains releases.This is the closest to the recent stuff, the really fast tempos and angry vocals, but the better Vital Remains are the other ones featuring Jeff Gruslin on vocals and Forever Underground with Joe Lewis on vocals, and then Thorn singing on this one. Lots more groove and variations in the music, The Benton stuff is just relentless pummelin'..If you like these guys start with Horrors Of Hell, than Let Us Pray and Into Cold Darkness....Important Death Metal, from masters of the genre...Kneel..!!"
1,wrong sizing,"I liked the looks of the watch, but i found the face too large for my wrist, therefore i returned it."
3,trying again.,Decided to brush up on my math. Nice like the book easy to use. Print is so small though.
4,Practical Algebra,The content is good and easy to pickup. I only wish they didn't have the answers to the problems printed right below the problems in the chapter.
4,Algebra again....,"It has been many years since I took Algebra in school and for a college level math course I needed to brush up those skills. This book, although I am not all the way through it, is excellent. It starts out slow and uses examples along with complete explanations of the problems."
4,Practical Algebra,Practical Algebra offers a easy-to-take approach to exploring algebra. It actually makes learning fun! The authors take the subject seriously not not themselves. I would recomment this book to anyone wanting to improve their skills in algebra.
4,A very practical guide.,"I am a returning student. I haven't studied Algebra in quite a few years, so I was looking for something that wasn't as large as a normal Algebra handbook, and yet was good enough to fill my need for a refresher. Practical Algebra did it. The book is laid out in a wonderful order that allows you to flow through the book given you allow yourself enough time to grasp the concept in your current chapter. There is a good solid set of questions, and self-tests throughout the book. If you haven't ever studied Algebra, or are returning to it after years in hiatus, you can stop your search here.The only thing I wish this book contained though it was skipped, was a good review/introduction of how imaginary numbers fit into Algebra."
2,Beware,"This book does not explain things well enough, I did algebra years ago and forogt seps and formulas how to do things. This books does not help you relearn those formulas what so ever! all it does is create false confidence"
4,"Where's my $10,000?","Let me begin by saying that this book is wonderful. It is helping me prepare for my return to college in a way I thought impossible. I now have confidence in my abilities rather than fear.I have a beef.On page 3 the author boldly claims ""Even we're not perfect. But we're close - so close that we've authorized our publisher $10,000 to any reader who can find a mistake in this book."" It goes on to say that the publisher said. NO WAY.Smart move.Directly above this statement in PRETEST #1, Section 4, Question (d) there is a mistake! The line 1364 should be 1384. Please do the math and prove me wrong. Or, better, send me my imaginary check for $10,000. (You can find this page on the amazon site as excerpt 3)While this is no major mistake it is worthy of the prize, no?"
3,Education,This helped me in my Algebra class! I recommend you get a tutor to help with Algebra the book helped but I did not know that much about algebra so the combination of the both of them helped me pass my class.Ronna C.
4,A very useful book,"I recently decided to upgrade/refresh my math skills. Having been away from any higher function math for about 35 years, I decided to start with algebra and work up from there. This book is the one I chose based on previous customer reviews, and I am extremely pleased with it. While it can be a little dry, it is straight forward, easily understood, and a great review of the basics. Best of all are the exercises to reinforce what has been learned, and the self tests. There is a logical progression to the text, a building block approach which works well for reinforcing concepts.Highly recommended for those of us who've been away for a while and want to brush up on our skills!"
3,"Good for general algebra, not advanced..","This book is good for the basics. Not so good for advanced algebra, or intermediate. It covers square roots and a little on exponents, but doesn't seem to touch on negative exponents. You won't find very complex problems in this book, but it is good for a refresher on much of the basics."
1,Bad Explanations,"They give you a short explanation of the problem, then some examples for you to try. But they don't explain everything they should before hand. So you are left looking at the answer to try and decipher how they came to that conclusion. I would recommend getting another book."
2,"Petery Selby & Steve Slavin, great @ math, bad @ teaching","I normally only review a book if it is either completely outstanding, or frustratingly awful. This book is the latter and I am shocked at the 5 star reviews. Much like the author's other book ""all the math you need"", this one is lacking in so many places. If the author were a swimming instructor, he would briefly explain to you how to do the backstroke, then immediately grab you by the belt loop and throw you in the deep end fully expecting you to swim. The practice problems at the end of each explanation go googles beyond anything that was explained. This leaves you frustrated and confused at ever turn. I've fortunately found some excellent resources on the web that fully explains every concept covered in this book. There's no doubt that the author knows the subject and it was a noble effort to attempt a book, but some people have no business attempting to cross over into the teaching business and this is a prime example of just that."
3,I have the 1991ed. version,"I revisited this book when I decided to return to school for my doctorate and actually was required to take my GRE AGAIN, as a decade had passed! I love geometry, trigonometry, all sorts of puzzles, and abstractions. I find algebra rules to be contrived and not at all intuitive, so algebra is difficult for my mind to integrate. I need an algebra book written by someone who either thinks more as I think or who understands the challenges algebra presents to one such as I. This is a regurgitation of the SOS for me. No better than my 9th grade text.Also- on page 3 the author offers a challenge to the reader. He claims that he would pay, were it not for his publisher's objections, $10,000 to anyone finding an error. I found an error on page 2 (Pretest #1, 2c) and then another error on page 9,(answer 9a). This belies the author's credibility- to say the least."
4,Algebra,This book is more of a high school training book. I did find that the book gave clear and concise information on how to solve basic algebra problems.
4,Good but could be better,"This is a great book, but it could be better. I skipped some parts that I could solve at a glance. The last third of the book did not hold my attention. I liked seeing how to factor polynomials, long division of polynomials and square roots."
5,Practical Algebra,This is a great book. Very Well Done. Over 300 pages. A Great Review WITH NO ERRORS. Highly recommend it!!!
4,It's good,"The book is what it claims to be, a self study guide, it worked well and effeciently for me. By getting about 1/2 of the way through the text I was able to increase my algebra score enough to move up an entire quarter of math. If you haven't consciously done algebra for years and need to enter the classroom this is an excellent review and will definately show you where you need help and more instruction. It was also in good repair as promised, all interior writing was in pencil."
5,An absolute must for reviewing or learning algebra,"This book is absolutely excellent. Well written, step-by-step learning with excellent examples and format. Easy to learn. I didn't find one typo mistake. A rarity today. With forty years of training under my belt, you could not get a better source for learning algebra."
5,A Delight!,"If Math gives you pleasure, you'll love this book. Over the years I've either forgotten some of the basics of algebra, or can't recall how they're derived. Since algebra is the foundation of so much in the great field of mathematics, this book is invaluable. The authors not only know their subject perfectly, they also know how to teach it through the written word. The text is not long-winded, and examples are given in the form of frequent small challenges to the reader to work problems for her or himself. The problems selected have a way of bringing enlightenment. For example, if you arrive at a solution other than the one given later in the text, your mistake will probably reveal to you the logic you should have used. These problems, then are a continuing form of instruction.This is no novel, or light reading. It's absolutely wonderful. I can't recommend it highly enough. And what a bargain!"
3,practical algebra,they give you the problem and the answer but not how to get there. i needed someone to show me how to get there. good book but make sure you have help
5,Glad I choose this one...,If you're like me and haven't done any Algebra since leaving highschool (for me that was 15 years ago) this book is a excellent refresher course. The authors have use a conversational style in presenting the concepts of Algebra. Reinstalling your basic knowledge of math before you became tied to a calculator and guiding you through Algebraic methods and then backing those up with lots of examples and problems which really helps illustrate each concept. There is also a self-test at the end of every chapter.I'd forgotten most if not all the Algebra I was taught at school but this book has re-awaking the geek in me and made Algebra (dare I say it) enjoyable and not a not a teeth renching experince I'd invisioned.
1,Unnecessarily Confusing,I bought this book to help teach my fiance algebra before he starts school in the fall. It does cover everything BUT it the author seems to go out of his way to make everything more complicated than it really is. I wouldn't recommend it unless you already know algebra and are just looking for a review.
5,Excellent!!!!!,"This book is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I am getting ready to start college, and I wanted to major in theoretical physics but all I had ever taken was basic math through school. This book helped me learn more in one week than a high school teacher could in a month. If you want to learn algebra, and are good in arithmitic buy this book and see for yourself."
3,"Good, but too detailed for quick reference","This is a good book if you have time to sift through the 1000 pages. I was hoping for more of a quick-reference or pocket-size style of a book. Other than that it has everything you need about recommendations for tests, guidelines and risks regarding any aspect of healthcare including counseling in prevention of several diseases. The book also goes beyond the realm of medicine to include violence, and motor vehicle injury prevention. I would purchase this book for a graduate level prevention course or anyone enrolled in a MPH degree curriculum."
5,Is it enough?,"As a history teacher I'm often asked by my students, why we continue studying the horrors of Holocust. And i tell them because we owe it to the people who suffered so much and died to learn about their story, and to learn about why a whole people could be led astray to such an insane degree - by one man to commit such atrocities - and because history has repeated itself so many times since proving that we need to be on guard against demagogues tempting people to heed the call of the inner cave man.I think Spielberg and the Shoa foundation has made a very valuable and thought provoking contribution to the knowledge of the atrocities that took place during and after the Seconc World War."
5,Excellent Holocaust Documentary,"Like most other things bearing Speilberg's name, this documentary is top notch. It gives a wonderful perspective on the holocaust, following a group of survivors from the holocaust from all different walks of life. My high school students loved it, and I highly recommend it to teachers for use as an accompanying piece with Elie Wiesel's Night or any other holocaust literature."
5,Powerful and compelling,"This documentary is incredibly moving and gives a face--five faces--to the suffering of the holocaust. What this documentary offers that many others do not is the story of these individuals since: the trials and triumphs of re-creating a ""normal"" life."
1,Be very careful,"Spielberg is a household name, a lot of people will see that and instantly put trust in the information presented in this video.I urge everyone to put emotion and belief aside and think logically and investigate yourself on the claims these people make. There's a good video on Youtube called ' The Last Days of The Big Lie '. It exposes the people presenting their side of the story. There's documented proof the African-American soldier's claims are fraudulent yet Spielberg still puts him in this video and it's presented as fact.Do your own research, think critically even when presented with such an emotional story as 'The Holocaust'."
3,Starforce!!!,"good game, but beware, the games installs starforce drivers as part of the copy protection, and they have messed my XP.... after I installed this, I was unable to install other programs since, making me consider a full system reinstall in the near future."
1,I can't enjoy what I can't play!,"Having played the first Spellforce game, I figured that the second one had to be even better, right??? Well, I don't know. I have 2 computers that I have tried putting it on. One has Windows XP installed. The games main play menu will not show up on the screen. It frezzes up everytime I try to play it. My second computer has Windows 7 installed. When I get to the main play screen and hit play, it tells me the first time for gameplay needs to be run as an administrator. When I try that, it does nothing!! If this is any indication of how this game is going to be.....well, I think that THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!"
1,Won't Work on 7,"I bought this game several years ago, but I only now got around to installing it and trying to play it. I have Windows 7 OS, and it won't play on it. Tried several things to get it to work, including running it in compatibility mode for both Windows XP and 2000, but nothing helped."
4,fun,not finished playing it yet but it is a fun game.good graphics fair story line.small learning curve.good game length.
4,Nice RPG,It has a good story and graphics. The interface is nice and easy to pickup. It was definately fun to play.
2,1-st version was alot better,"I'm very unsatisfied of that game. Too slow, even on my fast computer, slow and hard to control gameplay, lack of usefull shortcuts, too much info on screen - no space for the action, interacting with characters is difficult and often leads to leaving them just to do what computer decides!!!!!!!!!!!!!Bottom line: DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME !"
1,No Key,Warning this game does not have the needed CD key in about half of it packages due to poor quality control. Don't buy
1,Effing mad,"After buying this game in spite of the bad reviews it was generating, simply because the original was said to be so good, i cannot even play the game because it did not come with a CD key. I am very dissapointed that people would have overlooked this very simple detail. Do not buy this game."
2,Boring and Uninspired,"Never tried the first spellforce, so I don't know if it was supposed to be any good. But if the second is any indication, I don't think I'll bother with finding out. The game tries to be both an RPG and a Warcraft style RTS. What happens instead is that your characters wander through some hokey maps killing random monsters (not very difficult) until they ""stumble"" across an army that needs to be suppressed. At that point, they build the necessary unit factories and march off to war using the same hokey maps. The RPG side of the game is a poor copy of Diablo with a similar, but relatively useless set of skills. The RTS side is equally uninteresting with units that have few redeeming qualities. There is no point in developing any strategy harder than the classic rush 'em, i.e. throw everything you got at the bad guy, no matter what it is.... you'll win every time."
1,"Yes, it does use STARFORCE","* It is in the game listing as of 8/10/2006(Boycott Starforce)* It is mentioned in the forum as using STARFORCE + causing problems(Boycott Starforce)* This is Aspyr Media* Also check out the bugs/patch + system requirement complaintsJoWood said ""future"" releases won't use STARFORCE.What future releases ... which distributor ?I know of several games/producers that issued a ""remove STARFORCE"" patch ... one company said they would stop adding STARFORCE after their latest game ... I know of no company that pulled product; removed STARFORCE; then ran more production without STARFORCE included ... someone can correct me if I'm in errorSo, I guess if this stays ""as is"", we either have to buy this game here with STARFORCE or do without.If I see updated info regarding this issue, I will alter my review.When this game is available without STARFORCE; I will purchase it."
5,A well-researched book that is fun to read!,"DINING OUT is a unique take on the current American fascination with restaurants. It's the first overview I've ever seen on how restaurant critics approach their job, and a fascinating one at that. Although it does stretch the average person's mind to generate symphathy for the food critic who must dine out night after night, the authors' synthesis of many interviews gives new dimension into how these critics shape our tastes and expectations. Moreover, they balance the critics' viewpoints by offering up a selection of glitterati chefs, who express themselves openly and pungently. Living in NYC, my husband and I eat out a lot, and I found this book useful in learning how to get the best service and the best food. There are also juicy tidbits about critics and restaurateurs that enliven the text throughout."
3,so-so,"Given the first two books they wrote, I expected more. This volume seems to be just a fluff piece to pay the bills. If there was a positive, I have realized that I know as much about food as most of the reviewers. At the same time, the chefs complained about reviewers not understanding them. When I go out to eat, I am NOT there to understand the chef. It's my money, then need to understand me. It may be worth reading but get it from the library."
1,Whats all the fuss ????,"Sorry folks, but I really had a hard time getting through this one. I got Dining Out and The Making of a Chef(not Becoming A Chef) for Christmas. I found Dining Out to be slow, difficult to read, and mostly boring. I love cooking, I love Dining out, but I felt like I was reading a high school text book. The lay out was jerky, and the writing matched. The content was bad as well.. oh those poor reviewers. I knew I was in trouble when I went to the list of Seattle spots, only to find ""Ettas"" a wonderful place, written up as ""Eddas"". Then early on a glaring typo of New Yrok. Life is to short for bad wine and bad books, stay away from this one...Cheers John Maltman"
2,Nothing to get excited about,"In college we all sit around late, drinking, and complaining. This volume shows that chefs do that too. I found very few secrets or even good ideas. But I did find a lot of chefs crying about being misunderstood by the public and the reviewers. I guess speaking with the authors was cheaper than getting a therapist. But the authors' style is consistent. Still that uncritical idol worship."
3,Lacks a strong narrative voice and guiding intelligence,"Kind of interesting, but I missed a real sense of the whole foodie thing as a cultural phenomenon per se. And I kept wishing that Jane and Michael Sterne or Jeffrey Steingarten would bring their formidable acumen and wit to bear on this topic. The authors are thorough, dutiful, informative, and so dang serious about it all."
5,Nominated for two major book awards in 1999.,"I saw that Dining Out was nominated for both the 1999 James Beard Book Award *and* the 1999 Julia Child Book Award earlier this year, and finally picked up a copy. It's an absolutely ground-breaking look at restaurant criticism in America today, with enough delicious stories (and sense of humor!) to make it a very enjoyable read. My fantasy now is to visit all the restaurants mentioned by critics as their favorites across the country!"
5,behemoth are the polish best for crowleyain black metal,"i so love this band! even deicide listens to them and for great reason, these guys are polish shredders. i got into this band after deicide put out the most crappy album with ""til death do us part"" which i won't own because there is nothing trade mark deicide about it and because i thought it was the end of them, just look at the liner notes. even steve asheim and eric hoffmann have cameo's on this release."
4,COLORS,"I have been searching everywhere for Hanes Comfortsoft Boxer-briefs that come in solid colors - not stripes or patterns. The picture on this page shows 3 pairs of solid colored underwear and says ""assorted colors"". We're okay with assorted colors, but not assorted patterns. The underwear arrived with 2 pairs of solid colors and one pair of striped underwear. grr. I was going to send them back and contacted the seller, but we're really desperate so we decided to just call the stripes a loss and move on. Much to my surprise and delight, the seller immediately corrected the problem. Now that's customer service! I should note that the package does actually say ""assorted colors"" on it - so the seller listed it correctly, just posted the wrong photo. Hope this clarifies for any others with an aversion to ""non-solid"" colored undies."
5,Very comfortable underwear,"My son loves this style of underwear. It's his favourite, and afterhe kept ignoring other styles in his drawer, always asking if there wereclean versions of this style, I made my laundry day come less frequentlyby buying more. He highly recommends the comfortable fit."
5,Soft and comfortable,"My 2 year old son is excited about potty training and doing extremely well in the daytime with his new boxers. They are soft, with no tags and fit wonderfully. He feels like a big boy and is motivated to keep them dry."
1,Not like they used to,"I had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions I wear. They are my son's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room. He's only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear. In my personal thoughts are that men's/boy's underwear has a fly in the front for need use, unlike that for women and girls whom don't require it."
1,Beware,"These have no opening!!! Maybe the online advertizement said that, but I missed it!! While it might not matter on a very little boy, I mistakenly purchased these for an 11 yr old that was appalled at my blunder."
5,Great for very young boys!,"I bought these for my son when he was two years old. It's very hard to find boxer-briefs in size 2T-4T (xsmall)! I wanted underwear that he could slide on and off easily by himself when going to the bathroom. The very soft waistband in particular makes this really easy. They fit well, hold their shape, are very soft, seem very comfortable, and are cute too! He's three years old now and still enjoying them."
5,Great porduct,This was ecactly what they said it was. I used on my Swarovski 10 x 50 binos. It worked great and a whole lot cheaper than the Swarovski model
4,On the verge of brilliance,"Many MSP fans will tell you that their finest album is, without a doubt, The Holy Bible, and, whilst this offering is admittedly not up to the standard of its successor, it is representative of a band on the verge of an inspired musical breakthrough. To its credit, there are many excellent songs here, including From Despair to Where, La Tritesse Durera and Nostalgic Pushead among them, the lyrics to which are inspired, if somewhat detached from the political concerns of their other albums. For me, however, the saving grace of this album is that, no matter how much it fails to compare to The Holy Bible, it is still far better than the gradual trend of radio-friendly sing-along tunes inherent in their most recent releases."
2,Middle of the classics,"I waited a lot for this album because Manic Street Preacher's first album Generation Terrorists was so brilliant. After the listing Gold Against the Soul, I have to say something. I am really disappointed because there are only three fine songs a beautiful Sleepflower, a fine From Despair to Where and an excelent Life Becoming a Landslide. Rest of the album songs are booring and bad ones. This is not a punk alnum anymore! Gold Against Soul is the album middle of the two classic albums! In my opinion, you shouldn't buy this one1"
3,Toy of Average Interest,"We bought this for our 4-year old grandson who loves to play hide-and-seek. However, his 6-year old brother showed more interest in playing with it. They both liked the beeps and the lights when trying to find the bottom of the treasure chest. However, the 4-year old quickly lost interest and preferred playing good-old hide-and-go-seek. He hid with the treasure box; however, he kept turning it off. The 6-year old played with it longer; however, he found it frustrating that the red light indicated he was ""hot"" but he still could not find the treasure since the box could be hidden in small areas. We give this an average rating."
3,"Great Toy, Bad Customer Service","I am writing to share my experience with trying to obtain the toy. When Wild Planet was unable to deliver the toy, custoemr service called but did not leave a call back phone number or email. I had to search to find a number in which the only number available was for placing an order. The orders department could not transfer me to any other department as they were in another building and would not give out the main office number. Also, I never received an email with the order tracking number.However, the toy is good."
3,Very Small!!,"Make sure you look at the dimensions on this game before purchasing it - it is very small. It is not meant to put things in, it is mearly a transmitter designed to look like a treasure chest."
5,"Great improvement to the traditional ""Hot or Cold"" game!","Our 5 yr. old daughter loves anything with pirates so when we saw this we thought it would be perfect! When she first started playing with it, she was thrilled. You put the base of the treasure chest in a ""hiding spot"" and use the top as the ""map"" to find the treasure. As you get closer to the treasure the ""X"" on the map blinks from blue (cold) to yellow (warmer) to red (hot) and beeps wildly. Our whole family has had a great time playing with the Treasure Hunter. Well worth the money and easy to bring to Grammy's house too!"
4,"Great Toy, but treasure chest pieces can be difficult to open",Great toy! My 6 and 9 year old love it. As other reviews say it is much smaller than we expected. One problem is that the top and bottom half got jammed together where we could not open it. I finally figured out a work aorund to open it if it gets jamed or locked together. Put a very small computer size flat head screw driver in the lock area crack between the two half and push in. This did the trick to open it.
4,Pretty fun,"We bought this game for our son on his 6th birthday. He had a pirate themed party. It's an easy game to grasp - Hide-n-seek and hot/cold. When you get warm and the X changes to yellow you are really warm. You almost have to be on top of it for it to change to red (hot). It's a fun game though. He likes it more when he hides it and mommy and daddy have to find it. I can see the novelty wearing off soon, but it's been fun."
4,Just like a regular girl,"I was a little sceptical about this book. But even with her unusual job, Joan is still a girl just like you and me. The humor she uses to portray her workday, and her life in general will warm your heart."
5,One of my favorite memoirs,I loved this memoir! I was really sad when I finished it. Kelly is so honest and funny. I wish she would write another book.
2,Disappointment,There is nothing I can say about this book that will improve it. It is a memoir and shouldn't be viewed as anything but that. One cannot learn the lifestyle from this book.
5,One can never go wrong buying Basil Lubbock's books,Basil Lubbock's books are a treasure chest of historic sailing. This book gives a vivid picture (perhaps a view often preferred to be forgotten) of the horror connected with slave trading. The sailing era was not always romantic but often hideous. This book is a must read for those interested in history.
4,Sahara Hotnights are great,"What the hell is this guy from little rock talkin' about? I think he listened to a different CD than I did... Because Sahara Hotnights are a very nice rock 'n' roll band. Anyways, go check them out live, 'cause I bought this cd at one of their gigs for only 5 guilders (2 us dollars)."
5,Nora Roberts at her most romantic best!,"As a devoted fan of Nora Roberts I was thrilled to hear she was beginning a new trilogy. ""Key of Light"" doesn't disappoint. The story is vintage Roberts--sexy, funny, mystical, with a cast of characters who are well-defined and very interesting. I love the men so much, I can't decide which one I think is sexier. The character of Dana starts out a bit harsh, but the character improves as the story progresses. I could not put this down--I ended up late for a meeting, late for a brunch and staying up too late on a work night to finish it. Read it today!"
3,What happens when you write too many books...?,"I'll tell you, they all end up sounding the same. An art gallery? Been there. A small, picturesque town? Been there. Otherworldly Celtic beings whose fate depends on the three mortal couples and their copulating... BEEN THERE TOO!!! I ask you, is there anything at all new about this story? Oh yeah, her gay best friend... just proves Roberts can keep up with what's cool in the world.The thing is, the story's not terrible. Her dialog has gotten wittier; the barbed banter between all of the characters is highly amusing. But the plot, the advancement of it, the descriptions of people and places - we've been there before, and I'd come to expect better from the woman dubbed ""America's #1 women's fiction writer.""In comparison to many other less-celebrated romance authors, she's not at all creative or half as engaging. Where I used to buy all of her novels, I'm now contented to get them from the library."
2,Romance a mystery,Positives - The fantasy/mystery story line was promising and the book itself is well written.Negatives - This story is much more a romance then anything else and for that to work I need to care about the relationship. Unfortunately this love affair was stupid and childish... What I'd expect from a junior high school coulpe (but with more sex then I remember).I'm not going to bother with the rest of the trilogy.
4,"The ""Key"" trilogy begins","Ancient legend tells of three half-human Celtic Goddesses who have been imprisoned by an evil God who despises anything human. Story tells that their souls were captured in a glass box with three keys that only three humans can open.Malory Price doesn't believe the legend... at first. However when she and two new friends, Dana Steele and Zoe McCourt decide to searh out the keys at the request of the mysterious Rowena and Pit, her opinions change. Danger is all around as the wicked Kane tries to defeat them. Fortunately Malory has the help of her friends and the new love she's discovered with Flynn to see her through.This is an impressive start to the trilogy. Readers will love the use of art to tell the story of the three sisters and how they can be saved. malory is an art connoisseur herself and that helps her resolve the mystery of the first key. it will be interesting to see where the story goes from here."
3,Key of Light,I wish it had more story and less sex. The basic story was good but was over powered by all the writing about sex.
2,Skip It,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge Nora fan. I have read nearly all of her titles from the Donovans to the MacGregors to Roarke and Eve. And everyone in between.However, this series was not worth my time. I haven't even been able to make myself purchase the last book in the series. The romance plots were more than predictable, and not even a little enjoyable to read. No attachment to the characters. And the events that happen in another realm are silly. You don't really believe in the characters and the God and Goddess, nor do you care about them. Don't bother."
3,"Not a bad way to spend an evening,",but I'm not sure I liked it enough to read the rest of the trilogy.
2,I'm sorry,"I really do like Nora Robert's books and I love the JD Robb series, but I could not get into this book. I've read fantasy books before, I've read books like Laurell K. Hamilton and Kelley Armstrong, so nothing is too far fetched for me to read. But I tried and tried and very soon lost interest in this book. There was nothing that kept my interest, kept me wanting to read to find out how it ended and there was nothing in this first book that sparked the desire to read the next two in the series. I'm sorry, but this was not one that I would recommend."
1,Don't bother reading this -- you probably already have!,"Sorry, but this trilogy is no different from others Nora has written. In fact, if you read Three Sisters, then you pretty much already have read the same basic story as this put forth in this book. I'm not sure where all this ""wit"" other reviewers are speaking of comes from, I didn't think the dialog was that engaging. I love Nora Roberts, but over the last two years her books have become predictable, formulaic, boring. She's a great author who needs to slow down output to write a unique novel. Or doesn't that fit the current business model?"
1,Dumbest Ever!!,TERRIBLE - STUPID - DUMB - STORY LINE IS RIDICULOUS - UNINTERESTING - ABSOLUTELY NO DEPTH TO ANYTHING - EVEN FOR A FANTASY IT FAILS HORRIBLY. I give this a book a below zero rating.
1,Language,Why does Nora Roberts have to use God's name in vain SOOOOOOOOOO much? Why can't she just curse without bringing God into it?
5,Wonderful,"This is another wonderful book from Nora Roberts. It has mystery, romance, comedy, and a goofy adorable dog. This one won't dissapoint and will leave you waiting in anticipation for the next two in the series."
3,A good start to the trilogy,"The book was rather slow to start, but it finally clicked and moved well. Part of that stems from having to set the stage for the trilogy and introduce all the characters.Mallory and Flynn are my least favorite leads in this series, but they're okay. Mallory was a little too perfect. She and Flynn are definitely a case of opposites attract, and I found it almost hard to buy that two such different people would be so attracted for the long term.As for the ""key"" portion of the story, this was extremely well done in this book, with all the pieces nearly flawlessly seamed. Some things were a little obvious, but not so much as to be a problem. The guys were a hoot; they were very realistically presented. And they were such...guys. Much of the humor lay there. I, for one, liked the interplay between the women, too."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"I don't have much time to read, so when I do sit down with a book, I like it to be a good one. I was not disappointed with ""Key of Light"" by Nora Roberts.I asked for ""Key of Light"" for Christmas and after dinner when everybody was relaxing, I picked up the book with the intention of just reading a little bit. The book immediately drew me in and I ended up reading long after everybody had gone to bed. I couldn't put it down!The book was so good that I went out first thing the next morning and bought the second book.This book had intrigue, romance, sex, wisdom, mystery, fantasy, good vs evil... Not to mention a surprise twist... a little bit of just about everything!I bought copies of this that I am sending to my family members so they can also enjoy it. I just can't say enough good things about it!! Definitely one of the best books I've ever read in my life."
3,Slow Start..,"I think the first book was just ok to me. I am currently reading The Key of Knowledge and I am finding it better then the first so far. I thought it was good, but it lacked the spunk that Roberts brings into her other books. At times the plot got a bit confusing. I have high hopes that the Trilogy will end with a bang.."
2,Fun but a page-skipper . . .,"Moe the dog is definitely my favorite character in the whole trilogy. I enjoyed the self-learning process of the characters, but there were still a lot of pages of repetitive matter on the evil curse and the rules of the quest, which weren't all that complicated in the first place. I would also agree with a former reviewer that the endings are flat. Still, the characters are gutsy and have a lot to overcome, and mixed in with a little romance and a dream-like quest, it makes for a good midnight read."
3,"Liked it, but...............","I liked the story but as other reviewers have mentioned been there done that. The story line is engaging and its a fun read. However i was really disappointed at how many times Ms. Roberts used the God d*** word. She is known as one of the best writers, so why does she have to use this kind of language? I think if i counted how many times she used that it would probably be in the 30-40's. I expected more from a best selling author."
1,Assembly line story,"There are clothing designers who magically weave color, fabric, and style together. Turning what was once a rolled up bolt of fabric into a beautiful creation. Then there are designers who use a cookie cutter to stamp out fashion ware for department chains like K mart. The bottom line is mass production and sales. I have always believed (and still do) Nora Roberts can magically weave a novel. However, this book reads as if it was stamped out from a cookie cutter on an assembly line. I regret purchasing all three books. Will be more careful the next time. It misses the quality of her earlier work."
2,Key of Formula,"An interesting idea that goes nowhere--This book is an example of formula writing at its best. There is no tension and no suspense--the plot twists are obvious and the caracters, while enjoyable, are lacking in origionality. I bet I can guess what's going to happen in the next two books even before they are published. Nora Roberts needs to take more time with her books; meeting her publisher's deadlines has robbed her fans of her origionality and care for detail."
3,Supernatural Nonsense,"This book did have some strong points - three great female leads with a strong, developing friendship, three manly men with a lot to offer, and enough romance to keep you turning the pages. However, I really feel as though the strong points were not enough to make this a stellar read. The book is about the quest to find a key that is linked with the past, gods, demigoddesses, etc. Roberts asks a bit much of the reader to suspend reality so much and imagine people reaching through paintings, appearing in middair, living to the age of 500, etc. - the realism just wasn't there. This was definitely a supernatural story moreso than a romantic one. This is the first book in the trilogy, and the first key of three that the women have to find in order to ""win"" 1 million dollars. I think, though, that the remaining two books will be almost identical to this one, and not really high caliber writing or romance."
2,Again?,"Like others have said, this reads like a re-hash of the Three Sisters. You can skim over huge chunks and still pick up where you left off.There are some words that keep popping up that bug completely, and certain things that she just can't put in right.Like ""jazzy""...when was the last time you ever heard anyone say that in real life? Or the several scenes where the girls were ""shaking their booties""...I mean, come on! It was like in one of her former books where someone was actually snapping their fingers to BarenakedLadies.I'm actually glad of the naughty words, though--it's more realistic. One thing I've noticed is that her endings are rather flat. And why does everyone always have to get married at the end??? Isn't enough to end it with just them loving each other? A triple wedding on Valentine's is the most hackneyed idea I've ever heard of.I think she needs to take a vacation for a bit to get some fresh ideas."
5,I've finally found it!,"I puchased this album about eight years ago under the title ""Emerald Castle"" from ""Sundown Records"" I fell utterly in love with this music. I later lost the tape, but still had the case with the address of the record company. I wrote them, but the letter was returned: apparently they had gone out of business. I was distraught. I could still hear that music in my head all the time and I was dying to hear it again. I've been searching online for about two years now and finally I've found it- the same album from a new record company.Folks this is THE GOOD STUFF. This is the most hauntingly beautiful Celtic music I have ever heard. This is an album you can buy with confidence. Happy listening!"
1,Not what I expected,"A DVD more about the making of the videos, minus the complete videos. Lousy audio. I guess I can use it as a gag gift for Christmas."
5,Great Value - no nonsense,"I had been looking in the dept. stores for a basic dress watch for work. I couldn't find anything that had what I wanted without frills. Saw this one at Amazon and it appeared to be what I wanted, but it's hard to be sure on line.Have had it for almost a year - keeps perfect time and looks so classy. It's very thin and goes well with business attire."
5,Great toilet seat for the money,I found this a great toilet seat for the money. The seat is sturdy when closed as well. Easy to install.
1,Junk,"Worthless video. Horrible camera work, blurry most of the time, sound was awful. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Made in someone's basement...,"Wow, what a bore. The old stock footage is uneven and doesn't show enough of the truck. Other footage was taken on the fly when someone happened to have a camera on the street. The song is OK, but once that's over my son walks away. Why would a child who LOVES trucks walk away? Because some guy's voice (which sounds like it's in an echo chamber) comes on talking about a bunch of stuff he can't SEE on the screen. What's on the screen? More garbage stock footage. This looks and sounds like it was slapped together in someone's basement."
2,Would not recommend,"I own several Real Wheels movies and thought I would give this one a shot. I found the picture quality to be less than I expected and the footage seemed out of date. The narration was dull and boring, and the children's voices screaming the number of the truck to be annoying. I would recommend any of the Real Wheels series instead of this - they never fail to please my 3 1/2 year old truck lover."
3,Great but the old version is better,"I checked out the Twenty Trucks dvd for my son from the library and he loved it. It was narrated by a male voice, talking normally and in an almost soothing tone. We then got a copy from amazon which appears to be re-done. The new re-done version has a different narration that grates on me. However, this video is still mostly brilliant at giving young boys what they want -- trucks. My 2 yo son just does not get sick of this DVD."
1,Not for kids who know a wide range of trucks already.,"This video would be a good intro for very young kids who are interested in trucks, but if you have a young child who already knows and loves trucks like excavators, wheel loaders, demolition trucks, feller bunchers, jackhammer trucks, bulldozers, mini-loaders, and the like, I would not buy this one. There are only about two trucks that were interesting for my three year old who loves trucks - the vacuum truck and monster truck. Out of the twenty, there are some really boring ones - even a bus and a pickup truck! If your little one is into construction trucks this will be a huge disappointment."
4,"Great for toddlers, a little mind numbing for grown ups","Ok - my two year old LOVES this, so it should probably get 5 stars. He wants to watch it ALL the time. He'd probably have it on a continuous loop if he could.I don't mind the ""home brew"" quality of this dvd - it's actually part of the charm - but the narration could seriously drive you over the edge. The script is weak and voiceover actors obviously went to the same school of acting as the kids on Barney. The syrupy voices exclaiming, ""You're so smart!"" or ""That's as high as a pro-basketball hoop!"" could drive any parent over the edge."
5,Asks for it Constantly,"Cedar, 21 months, LOVES this video and asks for it all the time. He isn't focused on the numbers past 4 or 5 yet (they count the trucks, 1 through 20), but the trucks fascinate him. He also seems to respond to the kids' voices throughout (they shout out answers and help with the numbers). I had read some reviews about poor videography ... whatever. It's not Spielberg, but it's not bad or grainy or a ""garage production."" Cedar could care less ... images are of TRUCKS, explanations of truck, showing how truck parts work. It's a winner here and I'm glad I purchased it. So is Cedar."
5,My four and one half year old twin grandsons just love this!,My son told me that my grandsons just cannot get enough of this DVD. They have watched it traveling in their car and at home. I am so glad they are enjoying it!
3,diamond in the ruff,Comforter is beautiful in color and design; but the center section of the comforter lacks sufficent inter stuffing. After a week the middle section has not fluff in appearance. it seems that there is not adqueate amount of cotton stuffing.
4,Great little meter,"This one is a great little meter for the money. Although not quite as accurate as other more expensive meters, the manufacturer is up front with this shortcoming. For the average user, the unit more than pays for itself in detecting magnetic and electric fields as well as microwave. I would certainly recommend this product."
5,Very good!,"This is the very good product, i am aware of. I measure the electromagnetic wave for low frequency. Very accurate & reliable data."
4,Good and usefull product,"I did not hold for a while in my hands an electronic device with label ""Made in U.S.A""! Wow! The device is made with good quality, convenient in use. I was able to find ""bad"" spots in my house with higher electro magnetic fields. Mostly generated by some electronics. I recommend this when choosing a place to leave or when relocating furniture in a house - just to make sure that you aere sleeping not in high EMF areas.Cons: the price is pretty high, but I think it worth it since it can save your health. Also the documentation is pretty weak, I'd suggest to add a booklet with examples of measures: what you can usualy measure and what numers are good and what are bad."
2,Works on certain fields better than others,"This field strength meter is good at detecting magnetic fields, not so good on microwave and radio.Needs very strong microwave/radio to show up. Example - cell phone booting up or initiating a call will move needle."
1,There are two or three versions of this instruments. This one provides 2 to 4 times the actual measurements.,"Its measurements are too high when compared to other professional instruments. There are two or three versions of this device that are available, you have to be aware which one provides the measured numbers versus providing the weighted levels which are usually two to four times higher in one of its versions.I hope you find this helpful."
4,Love it,"I really love this little device, it makes me feel so much happier about EMR around the house. It works really well and is very easy to use. Not very sensitive with microwave radiation, but great for magnetic!"
2,Not that accurate,"Bought this to measure EMF around the the house. I was getting some pretty high readings with the house power shutoff. I called So. Cal. Edison who will come out for free and read EMF around your house. This device registered 2-5 times higher then the professional grade EMF device So Cal Edison was using. They showed me their recent calibration certificate since these devices need to be recalibrated to maintain their accuracy. So, I wouldn't take the readings on this device too seriously. It will tell you there is a EMF field but not the correct strength of the field. Is it 1 milligauss or 3Mg? Can't tell."
4,"Bought it, used it, it did its job, bought from Amazon","I wanted some sort of a meter for the EMF frequencies. I bought this, and measured our 12 year old microwave. I had to be 6 to 7 feet away for there to be no movement of the needle. In other words, my old microwave was leaking badly. Rather than have it repaired, I bought a new one. On testing, the needle hardly moved within 6 INCHES of the machine. The new microwave emits LESS microwaves than the old one. The meter is serving its purpose for which I bought it. Hopefully, it can measure microwave towers (? cell phone towers) and cell phones."
3,A decent debut...,"I've had this cd for quite a while now but wasn't sure what I really thought about it. At first listen, it's very unusual. The shifts in tempo and time signature changes can sometimes be jarring. The vocals and lyrics seem to be deliberatley lowered, so as not to place as much importance on them as the music. If catchy hooks are your thing, this is probably not the place to look. However, I did feel the final track, ""Noni"" seemed to have the most ""pop"" feel to it, which isn't an altogether bad thing, since I liked the song. This is a pretty good debut. It kind of reminds me of Pink Floyd's ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn."" Experimental, bizzare, and not entirely commerical. I'd rather hear more bands like Chigger any day then stuff like Ricky Martin, Backstreet Boys, and Britney Spears. I hope to hear more from them in the future."
1,Not Great,"I saw this movie on a creature feature back in the mid 60's when I was a kid. It seemed creepy then, but doesn't hold up very well to today's standards. Don't waste your money on this dvd."
1,sucked,"low budget terrible acting. You'd think there would be better movies in this amazon offer, it sucks more than the movies"
4,Outrageously fun,"I'd not seen this film until i streamed it today . Wow , what fun it was . Right off the bat , a super cheap soundstage (complete with a smoking volcano) filled the screen . Next , a Japanese gentleman proceeded to ""act"" about as poorly as i'd seen in any fine schlock picture . I was already interested , when a Z grade Lon Chaney Jr. look alike strolled on the set . When my man grows a second head , look out . He tackles and runs faster than Michael Strahan . If YOU love retro and madcap storytelling , check this one out . By hook or by crook . Fantastic ."
3,Good book to have,"Good book, lots of details, and some never published photos. The book feels a bit clique-ish, like it is written with a very narrow scope. It contains a lot insider details that would be meaningful to a very specific audience, namely former VNAF or former South Vietnamese military audience. All the same it is a good book to have if you are interested in the VNAF. I do not care for the cover, feels too much like box art for a Skyraider scale model kit."
4,shagadelica,"A lively, bouncy, kaleidoscopic view on the topless dance girls of the late 60's.The most memorable short scene, is that of a ridiculously proportioned girl, Darlene Grey, doing a topless boogie in the desert. Otherwise petite, she almost falls over on several occasions, because of the weight of her swinging breasts!Unlikely to be forgotten in a hurry."
4,"Great product, but here's a tip!","Dental Fibers is great! The flavor is pretty terrible, nothing like spearmint. We put some toothpaste on our brushes and then add the fibers on top. It helps with the flavor and the fibers stick to the toothpaste."
4,"Beautiful, luscious ballet","This is a beautiful, luscious ballet with opulent costuming. The dancing and choreography are fabulous. It's only flaw is that of the Russian style of reserved emotion and passion in favor of technical perfection."
3,Eye Liner Pencil,"These were old looking, but usable. They look like they were in storage for years and someone just forgot about them."
2,not complete,"IF you're buying this to get a smattering of Emerson, fine; you'll get an introduction. The problem is that the kindle book doesn't contain the complete works of Emerson, as the title might suggest. You get an extremely abridged version of of the essay ""Nature"", for example."
1,DO NOT BUY,No where in the description does it say not for use with the XBox 360. What a waste of money!! AND it costs more to return it than what the unit actually costs. A real rip off
1,Pay attention to description not title and don't just add to your cart.,Company is preying on people not paying attention. This headset is useless. Xbox Live doesn't exist for the original xbox. So if you just read the title and add to cart off page you get screwed.
5,Great mystery movie,"Based on the novel by Umberto Eco, the movie does the story justice. It is great fun to see Sean Connery in the role of an elderly monk, instructing his novice--a very young Christian Slater. The basis of the story is multi-fold--murders at a secluded abbey, the debate over whether or not laughter is appropriate, and the Inquisition. I love the movie and the book for the acting, the writing--do both!"
3,melk momistary,Y wife and I resently visited Austria.we visited Melk momistary. We were given the inpreshenthat 'the name of the rose' was filmed here. That is way I purchesed the DVD. But after veawing the filmI saw that it wasnot. But is was still interesting.
3,Sean Connery is good......,"The movie dates to 1986, I think I remember going to the movies to see this one, or maybe TV? I remember it being better than it was the second time around.Sean Connery is good as usual.Bruce"
1,Lawyers and Beancounters,"Yes I am writing this review prior to the release of this Dvd. If lack of information is any indicator, I am INCENSED that this film would be released in a format that DOES NOT reflect how it was shot. It looks like another release I've been waiting for (Map of the Human Heart) also is not widescreen. The idiots (obviously NOT film fans) who make these decisions should be hung! It is an affront to every cinematographer to butcher films in this manner. If museums decided to crop works of art there would be such a public outrage that would drown out the CEOs of the studios for good. Shame on them!"
1,Dull and disappointing adaptation of Eco's masterpiece,"A dull and disappointing adaptation of Umberto Eco's masterpiece by the mediocre French director, Jean-Jacques Annaud. If you have only seen the movie, you will have no idea of the richness of Eco's novel. The movie only deals with the murder mystery (and it does this poorly) leaving aside all the philosophical debates and the esoteric minutiae that made the novel so compelling. The reconstruction of the era makes it look grim and depressing, and I don't think that was the feeling in the book. It's hard to think of a novel so poorly translated to the screen as this one (Reportedly, Eco is of the same opinion, and this is why he hasn't let other books of him be filmed). Connery (a fine actor) is indifferent here, while a young Christian Slater is totally out of cast as Adso (he has a ""what the heck am I doing here"" look). Skip the movie and read the book."
1,Waste of Time,"This movie is a complete joke! After reading Umberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose I find this movie to be a horrible shame. I was not expecting an amazing movie, just some entertainment. This movie so repulsed me I felt I need to write my first review on Amazon. The movie manages to make Umberto Eco's captivating characters into grotesque distortions of themselves. Not to mention the entire movie seems to have been leading up to the sex scene. In the book this scene is important but not anyway graphic, but apparently the director felt it necessary to make it into a 3 minute sex scene with full nudity. This is not my only objection to the director's adoption but it provides an example that the rest of the movie lives up to. So I repeat this movie is a waste of time, and greatly lacking of what The Name of the Rose deserved."
3,Amazing true classic!,Those who have read the amazing novel of Umberto Eco's The name of the rose should watch this screen adaptation. In my opinion the director Jean-Jacques Annaud has done a very good job here. I...Sean Connery lived upto my expectations as William. Connery has done a wonderful job here & F. Murray Abraham too has given a wonderful performance as the wicked Bernardo Gui. The original musical score by James Horner is terrific! It's very addictive.Those people who loves to watch Sean Connery's movies should watch this one. It's worth paying money for.
4,Midaevel Mistery - Great Cast - Great Cinemetography -Great Story,The only drawback is the flow of the story. It is a wonderful dark and realistic look at the period. The author of the original story (book) is a professor of midaevel history so this is quite accurate. I recomend this movie highly for those that saw Caedfile and want a more realistic gritty representation of the times. Great cast. Great Cinemetography and Great Story. If the story flowed in a more compelling manor I would have given it a 5 star rating. That is a small quibble. I recomend it highly.
1,Just a warning for families . . .,"Families & others who have moral standards should at least be forewarned that this movie has graphic sex scenes, with full nudity, etc. Wish I'd been warned."
3,Just a warning for families?,"This movie contains one lovemaking scene. Mainly, however, it's a story about hideous murders. A previous reviewer, one with ""moral standards"" who wished s/he'd ""been warned"" about the nudity was probably prepared to exhibit a series of gristly killings for the little ones, but was shocked to have them view equipment which is part of the anatomy of every human being.In other words, it's preferable, for example, to watch some guy stick a knife in someone's brain (Scream 2, first murder scene, aired uncut on broadcast TV at 8 p.m. last month), than to catch a glimpse of a woman's breast, at which we all have suckled. Welcome to Red America."
5,Top Ten,"Without a doubt one of my top ten favorite movies. Easily!!!! The movie is absolutely flawless as far as movies go. Now it's time to read the book, a whole 'nother world if you're familiar with it."
1,Can not view the DVD,Same as the review of The Magdalene Sisters. Can not watch the DVD because of Region problems. Waste of money
2,Out of sync,This is an awesome movie but the DVD I received had sound synchronization issues. I tried it in two different players with the same result.
1,Weak,"This film was a major disappointment. I recently finished reading ""Name of the Rose"" and not only does the film grossly deviate from the text, but the acting was very dry and uninspiring on all accounts. This is yet another example of the motion picture industry trashing a literary work of art. Comparing this film to Eco's masterpiece is like comparing ""The Scarlet Letter"" with Demi Moore to Hawthorne's book."
3,"A monastic Holmes, sort of","A complicated murder mystery set in a monastery in the 1300s, monks are being killed and Sean Connery, in a role very much in the style of Sherlock Holmes, sets about figuring it out. It finally boils down to an ancient Greek text, a comedy, that is hidden away in the secret library. I won't reveal any more than that. At 130 minutes it's way too long, and much of it has the feel of a hodge-podge. Filmed in Frankfurt and Rome; the library of hidden treasures was ""burned"" using special effects."
4,Great movie,"One of the most unappreciated movies by Sean Connery. To those who have read the book, it will seem like they left out a lot of the story, to those who haven't, this is a great detective story."
4,Great movie received with great service,"The Name of the Rose is a great film. A classic whodunit set in a Catholic monastery in about 1530 ad. It's a great story, impeccably told, and superbly acted by Sean Connery, Christian Slater, F. Murray Abraham, Ron Perlman, and the rest of the cast. The whole movie has a sense of urgency, and the timing of the events is flawlessly delivered to keep you on the edge of your seat. The cinematography is so well handled that you will actually believe yourself to have been transported back to those long-gone years. You can almost smell the stables. I love this movie, and highly recommend it to anyone who truly enjoys a great mystery or suspense tale.The service through whom I ordered the movie was as impeccable as the movie itself. My complements to them in a quick delivery."
4,Sean Connery at his best,The Name of the Rose is a 'classic' whodunnit. Set in a monestry somewhere around the 14th century and the Monks are dying! These Monks are an order that specialise in manuscript work. They copy/create beautiful illuminated manuscripts. Sean Connery is called upon to solve the mystery. The movie includes vivid insights into life back then and has you guessing til the last minute.Well worth a look!
3,Not is widescreen - why (greed?),Other then a profit motive it's inconceivable why DVD's are released several times in various formats and special editions. Here's another example of a movie that I would like to purchase being released in a made for TV screen format rather then the widescreen version. Guess that I'll have to wait(again) before buying this DVD.
3,Poor quality,The quality of the was poor and the price much higher than what i later found out i could have purchased CD for much cheaper.
3,The Name of the Rose - DVD,"It's a good movie but a bit slow. Not as good as I remembered it being I guess, however, still intriguing."

3,Pretty Good,"Of course not as good as Lance Armstrong's first book. In book 2 Lance tells about trying to win the Tour de France a second time and it is a good book and pretty interesting read. It is a lot like the first one; cataloging different preparations, struggles and pressures that he goes through to win again and again. A good personal look at Lance's athletic feats."
3,A lot rehashed from previous book,"If you are looking for exhaustive autobiographical coverage of Lance Armstrong, then you may choose to read this book, because it does offer insight into the life and times of Lance after the demise of his marriage. Much of the material, however, is rehashed from the previous book, which I read only the day before this one; as a result, much of the material felt very repetitive. My money was better spent on ""23 days in July"" and ""Lance Armstrong's War..."""
4,"Follow Up, how life is after cancer","This book is the follow up of the book, it's not about the bike which is about his career up till his second win.In this book, all his wins (5) in the Tour de France are mentioned. It is mostly about how he felt during the last three and how cancer played a role in it.It shows us there is more to life than just cycling. Cancer stays with a person for ever.His relationships with other cancer patients are emotional and gripping and is also shows he was the lucky one.This book stands out from other books about cycling, it is very personal and not just about baseball but also about life in general.He also explains some things that had happened in the Tours, his historic ride towards Mt Ventoux with the late Marco Pantani, his fall and Jan Ulrichs' fall. For those he have followed the Tour the last couple of years, this gives a very good insight, also because it is well written."
2,"I took someone's advice, I went to the library","I am a huge fan of ""It's not about the bike"" but I think he missed the mark here. I agree with others who reviewed the book that he is all over the board. The book leaves me with a satisfaction that I am glad it is not overdue at the library. I read it in 2 days and do not really feel moved or enlightened much, just educated about what happened in the races that I did not catch on TV or the news. I think he really could have done better."
1,"can you say ""loser""?","Dumps his lovely innocent wife, the two year old twins, Luke, his ""pride and joy""? Lance Armstrong is nothing more than an egotistocal POS who will spend the latter years of his life lonely and in regret. If there ever WASN'T a role model for anyone, it would be Lance Armstrong. The only thing sicker than his low-brow, low-life existance, it would be his ""cling-ons"" who struggle for a bit of stardom by saying ""yes"" to his every move Each so scard of being ""re-dumped"" buy a two year old mentality Armstrong, they'd rather drop all parts of character for riding the coattails of a soon-to-be ""has been"". Lance ""who""? The biggest question post 2004."
2,It's not about the book...,"If every second counts for you, you should probably skip this book and read something a little more worthwhile. Unlike his previous book ""It's not about the Bike"" this book lacks the drama and general interest for the common reader. That being said if you are a cycling fan you can probably find some behind the scenes stuff here to be interesting, but basically this is a recap of Lance's racing since the 1999 Tour De France win. Which means if you are a cycling fan you already know everything in this book and if you are not a cycling fan you wont care what's in this book.Overall it is more less just another puff piece athletic biography that seems more interested in re-enforcing Lance's status as a sports hero than it does delving into one of the most fascinating sports figures of a generation."
3,"Great Athlete, Mediocre Writer","Lance Armstrong is the most dominant cyclist of all time. As a result it is fascinating to read his perspective on training for the Tour de France, the race itself, and the US Postal cycling team. However, the plot is rambling and the message that every second counts seems fake and hollow from a guy who neglects his wife and kids for his adventure junkie thrills. The book is also a bit of an interesting read now that Lance's closest friends and teammates have admitted that the entire USPS team doped under Lance's instruction."
4,Enjoyable book - almost as good as his first book!,"First off, a disclaimer: I'm a huge fan and watch the Tour de France on OLN every day it's on.I liked the book a great deal. Nothing new here about the cancer that wasn't covered in his first book. Much more about his racing which I loved. A good deal about his family. There is some language (F word, etc.)but I liked that because it felt more like Lance talking and not Sally Jenkins who ghost wrote it.It feels real. It read easy. I recommend it. Almost as good as his first book!"
3,"Worth It For ""The Look"" Alone","Lance's first book, It's Not About the Bike, is a great book weaving together the author's fight to overcome cancer and his remarkable first win of the Tour de France in 1999.Every Second Counts continues the story, including action up to and including the 2003 Tour. But it falls far short of the standard set in the original work.Much of the material dealing with Lance's values as a family man and a cancer survivor is repetitive; having established himself as multi dimensional in Not About the Bike, Armstrong should have gone deeper into the racing action this time around.Nevertheless I didn't regret reading this. Lance's achievements are astonishing and every bit of insight adds something. The description of the epic moment in the 2001 Tour when, after bluffing, Armstrong stared down Jan Ulrich and blasted past him up the Alpe d'Huez is worth it in and of itself."
3,Every second counts...errors,"I have read both of Lance's books---I enjoyed the first one very much. The new book is okay with some interesting, behind the scene's stuff about the different stages of the tour. However, he kinda lost me on page #119, when Lance talks about the 2001 Tour, Stage 14 (Luz Ardidan) and he says that, ""...Ullrich slipped ahead of me across the finish line to win the stage."" That stage is one of my very favorites. I've watched and re-watched the video several times. But Ullrich didn't win the stage. Roberto Laiseka did. Ullrich got third in the stage....and yeah, Lance may have let him get the points since he had such a decisive lead---but Ullrich didn't win the stage. Is it a typo? Which race is Lance talking about. His book will go on to be an account in history and it is annoying to have it misrepresented."
1,"Lance, RIDE THE BIKE and STOP TALKING!!!!!","Who on earth wants to keep hearing the same story over and over? Okay, you had cancer, a woman helped you through it, you won 5 Tours, dumped the woman and kids, and decided to spend your last year as a celebrity chasing ""real"" celebrities. ENOUGH! You are 30 something and seem to be 17 or 18. Talented on the bike, yes. Good person? Hmmmm."
4,New Tales Of Victory And A Life Philosophy,"To do what has never been done is a defining part of what makes us human. To win the Tour Du France three or four or even five times was a spectacular accomplishment for any person. But for Lance Armstrong to brave every record by topping it six and then seven times is almost unthinkable. In Every Second Counts he not only tells his new tales of victory but shares his life philosophy to go along with it. Those who read his first book know that being a Cancer survivor changed Lance's life and since that horrific ordeal he has lived every waking moment as a living prayer to give hope to those who have to face similar hardships. If the first book made you a fan, the second is a reminder of why he is still admired."
5,"Very insightful, well written","This book is a very insighful look into Lance's life, and how it changed after being diagnosed with cancer. It describes his battle with cancer in detail, including lengthy descriptions of chemotherapy treatments. If you want to learn about cancer and chemotherapy, this is a good book to pick up!"
1,Boooooooo,"This book is HORRIBLE. If Mr. Armstrong feels the need to defend himself against the drug charges Europe was holding against him (which nobody believes anyway!), why didn't he just hold a press conference instead of publishing the worst book of all time? And why didn't his journalist co-author put into practice all her copy editing skills? I think my brain would have exploded if I had found one more typo in this book. Seriously."
3,Very Inspirational,"Overall, it was a great book. Since I had read the first one, I felt it was a little repetitive, but you can never get enough inspiration, encouragement and motivation from Lance Armstrong."
3,"A good book, spoiled by the last chapter","I loved the accounts of the 2nd to 3rd accounts of the tour de france and they were on the most part accurate, if not a bit exagerated. I thought in this book there would be more accounts of le tour, and less about the cancer. The last chapter is an insult to lances fellow proffesionals. Its not accurate as to what happenedm, and he accuses Ulrich of not waiting for him after the minor crash he had. He fails to acknowledege the part his team played in him winning the tour in 2003 (the team time trial). I felt this chapter runied the whole book, and I lost a lot of respect for Lance after this."
2,No yellow jersey for this one,"If you have read the first book go ahead and skip the first 100 pages or so of this book. Then you get to read about how his marriage is breaking up. Lance can not figure out what went wrong, but anyone who reads these two books are bound to figure it out. This book took, a person with a truly inspirtational story, and dissolved it all away. I do not think that I care for Lance anymore. It is lucky that he can get specially made equipment, because it is the only way he will get a helmet to fit over his enourmous head. Do not buy this book. Do not read this book if you want to respect Lance Armstrong."
2,Maturing Beyond The Bike,"I just read Lance's second book, ""Every Second Counts"" and it's left my head spinning!! I didn't know if this was the same person that wrote the book ""It's Not About The Bike""I felt sad for him, because it seems the only thing he takes ownership for in his life is racing and being a cancer survivor. Both of which he is a GREAT role model for, but he does not see there is so much more to life than that. This book really tells the story of how Lance is a thrill seeker, nothing more, nothing less.I hope one day Lance develops the skills necessary to take a deep look inside himself and then takes a wider view of the world and people in his life. When he reaches this point he could write another book and call it ""Maturing Beyond The Bike"""
2,Very Un-organized,"First Lance Armstrong is the best rider in the world when it comes to the Tour. I am a super fan of the man and the team.But he needs a new editor and co-author. Good God! It's all over the place. Have they every heard of a timeline?Dear Lance...Please give us what your fans want, team tactics, trials and tribulations,in your races. Stop trying to make another best seller by satisfying the general public."
5,Great Book!,"Holy cow, some of these reviews are pretty brutal. Don't be turned off by a few obviously bitter people. Lance puts a lot of thought and effort into this awesome book. It's an A+ on my list."
1,Lousy Human Being,"I'd given this 0 stars if I could. Anyone who would walk away from his family after they have supported him the way they have is a loser, pure and simple...Besides, I predict you will see him exposed as having benefited from doping..."
1,Lance wins 5 tours - loses all that really matters....,"Okay, he talks about all 5 of his tour wins in this book but the unwritten story is that he loses his wife and three children. Lance is self-centered, egotistical and at the end of the day, a real loser when it comes to what really matters. He is obviously frantically attempting to live big in his last year as a celebrity. There will not be a 6th. His ego is too much in the way. The book is a dismal failure although I enjoyed his first book. Poor Kristen, Luke, Isabelle, and Grace. Through familial association with this loser, they lose big too."
1,Lance Armstrong children's book,This is a children's book written by Lance Armstrong's first wife. I did not know this when I bought it for my adult son. My fault--I should have done more research!
1,Why did we need this book??????,"If you spent more time on your personal life instead of jet setting around and riding a bike (that is something kids do you know) you might be keeping a wonderful wife and actually being a ""real"" hero (aka ""a father"") to your kids instead of a cocky, arrogant flash in the pants. Lance's bubble has burst. No more big wins, trying to ""milk"" the history. Get a life."
2,SOOTHING SCRIPTURES,MY REVIEW IS THE SCRIPTS ARE FAR AND BETWEEN IT WOULD BE BETTER WITH MUSIC AND MORE SCRIPTURES THE WAVES ARE GOOD
4,great movie!,"I thought this was a very good movie. I'll spare you the plot summary since it's probably better if you just read the back of the DVD case and pop it in and watch it. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended for those that like ""caper"" or ""gangster"" movies with a twist."
3,"Eh, could be better.","I put this movie in my DVD player expecting to see a movie along the lines of a lesser-known Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese flick, I was rather displeased about an hour and a half later. The storyline revolves around a mechanic who is also a part time driver for the mob, who suddenly becomes involved. The first 15 or 20 minutes of this movie was a great set-up to the action. Only one problem...the action is minimal for a crime/gangster movie and some scenes are shot carelessly. The music score to the film is very interesting, sort of gloomy. With the exception of Jon Abrahams' sex scene, this movie does not have that much to offer. In some cases it just seems so unrealistic and almost comedic.I personally only watched this movie because I am a true crime fan and this movie is based on a true story, but also because I am a fan of Jon Abrahams and wanted to see him in a serious role for once."
1,Prepare To Be Bored To Death!,"The film's super-dreary plot features an assortment of super-dreary criminals, tangled up in confused, super-dreary relationships, which you'll spend ninety super-dreary minutes failing to make any sense of, until you're hit over the head with the sledge-hammering blow of a super-dreary letdown at the end.A few good looking faces may be all you have to look forward to."
2,Seriously,I brought this because of Morris Chestnut and he has all of 15 minutes the entire movie. I was disappointed and then the movie was weird. I can see why this was straight to DVD.
3,Informative,"From this book I learned all about how the immune system workswhich was great, I have CFS. I have to say that her recommendationsfor being a vegetarian are not good -- that's a good part of how I gotCFS...For some fast immune improvement, do Hulda Clark's liverflush in ""The Cure For All Diseases"" until your liver isclean. You should notice an improvement in your metabolism and skintone right away or after the first few flushes. The ingredients costless than $6 and you do it yourself at home over 24 hours! Piece ofcake and lots of bang for your buck.To really rock your world andaccelerate healing, read ""We Want To Live"" by AajonusVonderplanitz. This book is revolutionary and phenomenal and makes somuch sense. My energy has absolutely gone through the roof from hissuggestions, and, of course, because I did 12 liver flushes."
4,Good book,"Very useful information on ways to boost the immune system to resist and prevent disease, incuding allergies, arthritis, fibromyalagia, chronic fatigue syndrome, cancer, and much more! Although the book was written in 1999, there are many valuable facts on stress management, exercise, dietary supplements, and of course, diet, all science based. For instance, did you know that, ""Our immune system function is severely hampered by sugar consumption""(p. 73)? Studies are referenced that confirms sugars' ability to drastically reduce the ability of our immune cells to engulf bacteria. Since sugar consumption is far greater than must people suspect, we should become aware of what we're eating and drastically reduce our intake of sugars if we want a strong immune system. (Fruit juices, sources of quickly-absorbed sugars, should also be drastically reduced or eliminated.) Many other practical pointers are included in this easy-to-read book"
4,JUST A LITTLE EXTRA WORK...,"EXCELLENT TOILET SEAT. CAME WITH 5/16"" THREADED RODS FOR ATTACHMENT TO BOWL. ONE ROD HAD DEFECTIVE THREADS. A NEW ROD AND ALL WAS GOOD!"
5,looks nicer than the pricetag,"For a 20 something dollar toilet lid, it looks more expensive. Arrive in perfect condition."
4,Good basic tea,"If you enjoy blending tea yourself or using multiple tea bags, then this tea is mild enough to give you a good base. It is not a very strong tea like Tazo Awake, but it is good for Ice Tea and for daily use when you want to save on gourmet teas. Adding one bag along with other teas helps save money and doesn't produce a tea that is overly strong. While my heart belongs to Tazo tea, this tea is always in stock in my pantry. You can add in a few pieces of candied ginger from Melissa's produce and an Anise star from Dean & Deluca to make it more gourmet. Worth buying in bulk because you almost need two to four teabags to make one cup of strong tea.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Terrible!,"I don't write many online reviews, but had to with this one. If your buying this DVD hoping to see anything related to Looney Tunes, skip this one! It is boring, the voices don't sound anything like what you would expect the Looney Tunes characters to sound like, and the animation looks like it came out of the paint program in your accessories folder. This DVD is really bad and I have a high tolerance for pain!"
4,An attempt to bring old characters to a modern age,"True, this collection is not quite up to the standards of the classic clips. However, it's really not THAT bad. Even ok Looney Tunes are still far superior to most of today's fare, in my opinion.Here's a listing of what's included on the DVD:Sports Blab#1Sports Blab#2Aluminum Chef#1Aluminum Chef #2Tear FactorJunkyard Run#1Junkyard Run#2Junkyard Run#3Cagey WitnessInherit the WindbagFowl PlaySurvival of the DimmestBleach, Blanket, Bang-OHelter ShelterFinder's EatersSandcastle HassleI've Misplaced My PianoSpeared, Seared, and FearedOh My Darlin' SerpentineObstacles, of CourseFowl be Comin' Round the Mountain"
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","I rented this for a dollar last week, and I want my dollar back!The other reviewers have done an excellent job of bashing this abomination already. The ""Survivor"" take-off had one laugh (I now forget what that was, the rest was so bad), but the rest was unfunny. Fans will have noticed the occasional plagiarism of classic LT lines such as ""I'm only twee and a half years old"", but even these were placed in contexts that didn't make a lick of sense.If you must buy this DVD, please burn it and send the ashes to Warner Bros."
1,THIS MEANS WAR!,"LOONEY TUNES-REALITY CHECK: Wotta revoltin' development THIS is! Warner Brothers, as your own little black duck used to sputter in disgust, ""You're dethpicable!""...A fitting enough critique for this shameful, shabby collection of recent not-at-all-looney 'tunes, saddled with flat animation, abysmal Mel Blanc imitations, and an overall Z-grade attempt to cash in on Bugs and friends' 14 cawwot golden years. Of course, you know this means war!RATING: ONE DUMB BUNNY"
1,Would rate it lower if I could,"Concur with the other poor reviews. Bought this for my 3 YO expecting classic Looney Toons updated for 2004. Was sorely dissapointed. The animation is poor, the gags are non-existant on any level and the voices are poor imitations. Unfortunately I spent 17 potatoes on this junk at a major toy store. If I wanted some animation this bad I could have gone to the Joe Cartoon or Bullseye Art websites. No surprise there are lots of used ones for sale. For those of us who grew up with the originals, this was a wholesale letdown."
1,Awful,"To the reviewer below, yes, they ARE that bad. These cartoons are so awful that they should be destroyed. If you have ANY respect whatsoever for what made cartoons what they are today, stay far away from this awful DVD."
3,Common! they're not that bad,"Cenrtainly, the best Looney Tunes edition of this year is (without a doubt) the Golden Collection, but i had seen many of these moderns ""web-toons"" and they're not that bad.Maybe Mel Blanc, Carl Stalling, Chuck Jones, etc. where not involved in those toons, and the animation is not as good as the theatrical shorts, buy hey!, give them a chance! the Matrix parody is fun, and there are other toons that are funny.Anyway, you can buy this DVD AND the Golden Collection.... not OR"
4,Helped raise my teenaged nephew,"I have a vested interest in that I am selling this book. But, I have to also say that it saved my nephew's life. It raises the issues that confront parents and teens honestly, but with humor. It's a quick read since so much of it is illustrated by Ms. Guhl's very funny cartoons. I took in my 16 year old nephew and helped him through all but the last few months of high school and I'm very proud of both of us for weathering a rocky divorce together without either of us hurting the other. This book kept me from killing him or throwing him out multiple timesand helped me to see the human being behind the attitudes. I really think this book would be helpful to anyone else with a teen in their life."
2,White Elephant,"Back when online, Internet-based shopping was merely in a twinkle in Algore's eye, I bought this offering--Simple Minds's ""Life in a Day""--in a used-CD store. I had known, from listening to KROQ, that Simple Minds had written & recorded a few gems prior to their 1982 U.S. ""New Gold Dream"" debut, and I was willing to gamble that ""Life in a Day"" would contain some of these gems.When I skimmed the ""Life in a Day"" CD, however, I found that it did not contain these gems. Moreover, I found that it beared almost no resemblance to the brilliantly produced ""New Gold Dream"" record I'd adored. Moreover still, I found ""Life in a Day"" to be loud and cheesy, so much so that I couldn't bear to hear it more than a couple of times.I concede that I might have acquired a taste for this CD had I had the motivation to spin it a few more times--that is why I rate it with 2 stars rather than 1--but I lacked that motivation and ended up giving it away at a white-elephant-gift party."
3,Not for a newcomer to Simple minds,"I try to keep my reviews short and this is no exception. This album is good but not their best. As someone else has mentioned already, this is mid-70's Bowie and Roxy Music combined with some experimental post-punk. They would get this formula down with the next three albums. Overall, it is a bit inconsistent and lacks a genuine feel."
2,is this really simple minds??,"Once in a while you get an album that you don't like after the first listen but you stick with it and it grows on you. This is not one of those albums. In fact, I dislike it more an more everytime I hear it. At times I even doubt that it is Simple Minds. The only proof to me is that it really is them is that it sounds like Jim Kerr's voice. Obviously, they had not found there ""sound"" yet. I was expecting an album similar to their other early releases such as ""Empires and Dance"" and ""Sons and Fascination"" (which are two of my all time favorite albums) but this album is missing the cutting edge originality that I like so well. A previous reviewer used the word ""cheesy"" which is a perfect description. One song reminds me of a bad Go-Go's song. Let's all be thankful that they got better and evolved into the great band that they were meant to be."
3,Don' t mix up the Two Different YOUNG TIGERs!,"First of all, I think they should give the information that there are two different HK movies with the title ""(The) Young Tiger"".One with Meng Fei starring (this one),anotherJackie Chanas one of the villains (very small role).The cover art has nothing to do with the movie.(This often happens to old kung fu DVDs.)Meng Fei was just a newcomer at this time and the fighting scenes are dull (not only because of him) and the story is boring.If you are not a collector of his movies, I won't recommend this one.This is a contemporary action film, and Meng Fei is an ordinary young guy.You may feel strange if you are used to see him playing an classic Chinese hero likeFang Shi Yu series.His sharp eyes, brilliant smiles are already seen in hisdebut film, and here, too.Young Lau Kar Wing (Liu Jia Rong) appears as a villain and a choreographer.You cannot completely rely on Amazon's data, there are so many incorrect info."
1,The Young Tiger,"Apparently there are two Jackie Chan - The Young Tiger moives. This review is for the one in which J Chan is one of the bad guys and it is a supporting role. It is so bad I can't believe I made it through the whole movie. I don't expect high theatre from Hong Kong kung fu movies but even the fight scenes are very sub par. One of the charming things about Jackie Chan is that he doesn't take himself too seriously; his characters always do something goofy, comical, endearing. Since he is the bad guy and just a supporting actor, he can't/doesn't do anything goofy, comical or endearing. And the mole looks less like a mole and more like he has a leech on his face. If I could give it -0- stars for -0- entertainment value I would."
2,OF INTEREST ONLY TO SEE JACKIE CHAN AS A BAD GUY,"IN THIS MEDIOCRE JACKIE CHAN MOVIE, A GIRL THAT'S IN A GANG TRYS TO GET OUT BUT THE GANG WON'T STOP TO HUNT HER DOWN. BUT WHEN SHE DIES IN A TAXICAB ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL, THE CABDRIVER BECOMES A TARGET OF THE GANG, WHO THINKS HE HAS THE GIRL'S PURSE. THIS IS VERY MEDIOCRE FOR A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE. THE STORY IS DUMB, THE SCRIPT IS WACK, AND MOST OF THE FIGHTS ARE LUDICROUS. THOUGH JACKIE CHAN IS ON THE COVER OF THIS MOVIE, HE DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH. THE ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS THE FACT THAT WE FINALLY GET TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SEE CHAN AS A VILLAIN. WANT A BETTER JACKIE CHAN MOVIE FROM THE EARLIER DAYS? CHECK OUT ''THE YOUNG MASTER'' OR ''SNAKE IN THE EAGLE'S SHADOW''."
1,Featuring A Young Jackie,"This has a supporting role from Jackie, in which he appears with a huge clump of hair on the side of his face. This movie is weird and confusing. The only reason you should view this is to see how young he is and see the hair on his chin. Other wise stay AWAY!"
2,Pretty bad,"""Young Tiger"" is a pretty bad movie no matter what way you look at it. The acting is bad, the fights are mediocre, the dubbing is bad, and the focusing is terrible. It is almost like an amateur with a camcorder woke up one day and decided to make a movie. The only reason that I gave this DVD two stars is because Jackie Chan is in the movie."
5,Reflective Essays on practical theology,"These essays are quite down to earth and enjoyable to read. Included in the book are interviews with Annie Dillard and Francis Schaeffer. Even though this book is now hard to find, it is worth pursuing and purchasing. Thought provoking and well written."
2,Leaks,"I wore this watch every day for almost a year, it was great until condensation began forming under the crystal.Then the second hand came off, yikes."
3,Quality Issue,"I bought three of these and love the look of them. However, one of them was not glued well and the toilet lid came apart."
4,Hard To Find Toilet Seat,A beautiful toilet seat but hard to find because the companies which sell it don't bother to show you a good picture of it. Amazon had a reasonably good picture and the price was less than most other merchants. HooRay -- Amazon.
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this toilet seat a little more than a year ago because I liked the shell design. However, the ""wood"" that it is constructed from is a type of particle board (pressed sawdust). The seat cracked all the way across and is now useless. The toilet is not the only one in the house and it is sat on maybe two or three times a day."
4,A-ok for beginners,"This is a great book for young girls. Cute, creative ideas that are not hard to do. My daughters love it."
1,Siemens S56=Crap,"If you are thinking about purchasing this phone please do not. I currently have one and only after a few months of owning it the power began to shut off at random times and when I would turn the phone back on all my Ringtone settings will have been changed. Many times the phone will ring and no one will be calling and the only way to get the phone to stop is to turn it off and turn it back on again. Another extremely annoying problem is that after about a month of owning the phone the top oval shaped button fell off and now, having had the phone for nearly 10 months, the one, two, three, five, and six buttons have completely fallen off my phone. Though still on the warrenty, Siemens tells me that if a button falls off they cannot do anything about the phone being a piece of crap. I could continue you on with the numerous problems I have had with this phone but take my advice and if you are ever buying another cell phone do not buy a Siemens. Spread the word."
3,It 's an okay phone,I've had this phone for a year and so far it's been okay. The volume could be better and the speaker phone feature is useless because of it. The memo key is a pain because it's sensitive. It gets ready to record everytime I pick it up.
2,Not the best phone out there...,"I've had this phone for about a year, and I have not been pleased with its service. The number keys are small and have a tendency to stick. I have to punch the number several times before the number acutally dials. None of the ""special"" features are worth anything. In my opinion, there are much better phones (for the same price) out on the market today."
5,Excellent Acting,"For anyone who loves the Beatles, (Half the population of Earth) you will be rewarded with a fictitious but very realistic account, of what may of happened on this infamous meeting. Paul's character played by Quinn was truly remarkable. Since his death, so much of Johns place in history has been covered and magnified, while in many accounts Paul has been given an unfair shake on his place as an intelligent, sensitive and brilliant musician. I came off feeling how special and warm Paul is both in his humour and listening skills. Both actors though were outstanding. You walk away from this film wanting more. But unfortunatly we know, more did not happen. I would Love to see a movie of this kind be made of George Harrison's life. He is probably the most underrated musical genius of the modern era. Thank You!"
5,Very Funny!,"There is nothing revealed in this movie that the average Beatles fan doesn't already know. But Quinn shines in his portrayal of Paul McCartney. Literally EVERYTHING he says sounds like a question: ""You're looking well?"", ""Let's go for a walk?"". HYSTERICAL!"
4,a trip back in time,This is a good movie the actors are great the only thing missing is music it would have been nice to have more but a beatles fan will love this show !
5,BEST BEATLE MOVIE EVER,"I have read a ton on the lives of the Beatles dating back to when they were kids, through their fantastic journey in changing the music world and their breakup. I have to say this is the best because it takes two iconic figures, breaks them down and brings them to earth. It dispenses with ""Beatle Mania"" and all the fancy wrappings. It's not so much about them as Beatles, but as two best friends who've had their friendship ripped asunder being Beatles."
5,Made me cry....,"....for all the memories it brought back. This is an absolutely brilliant play about ""what if...."". I was so lucky to have grown up with the Beatles. They changed the world."
4,Cold by the Bay,"Very good book for canadian history buffs such as I. Easy reading and informative. Best if a person has already having read ""Empire By The Bay""."
5,Manzanar story for children,"The site of the Manzanar Relocation Center is found on Hwy 395 South in the Owens Valley of California at the foothills of the Sierras. I have stopped there on several occasions and imagined life as it might have been for the Japanese held there during WWII. Also, I have seen the display of artifacts and photographs at the Eastern California Museum in nearby Independence, CA. It is worth visiting.I had read stories written for adults on this topic, but Eve Bunting's story for children truly captured my heart. It is beautifully written and well illustrated and moved me to tears. It seemed especially poignant now in the light of the recent events resulting from terrorism; thank God we no longer suspect every one. I will always remember reading this book."
5,Not Just for Children.,Previous reviewers have told the story. The text and the art work are excellent. For anyone wanting to learn more about the Japanese-American experience during WW11 I recommend this book. It captivates you and makes you want to learn more. It deserves more than 5 stars!
4,wowowow,i got into The Brittle Stars about 2 years ago because a guy i was dating loved them. Your Street Is Dark quickly became and has remained my favorite song. Everyone should listen to this band. Her voice is incredible. It gives me chills every time i hear it.
5,Only Word of God - JPS Tanakh,"Anyone who believes that the Greek Septuagint is the Word of God needs to have his head examined. The Greek Septuagint is a counterfeit, corrupt, Christianized, second-hand copy of the Hebrew Bible, and if you don't believe me, believe the Dead Sea Scrolls, which prove that most Christian Old Testaments are full of theologically-motivated propoganda that have nothing to do with the real Hebrew Bible or the Word of God. The Masoretic Text contained in the JPS Tanakh was fixed in around 100 A.D.by the Masorites, and it is the only true translation of the original Hebrew Bible."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I'd seen one Russ Meyer movie before, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, and remembered it as a fun frolic filled with bountiful babes. So I bought Up! hoping for some light-hearted fun along the same lines, and boy was I disappointed. Up! is a mean-spirited, unfunny, violent movie that happens to have a fair amount of nudity. There are a few worthwhile moments, but none of them ends up being sexy because almost every scene ends with a rape or graphic murder. Not exactly what I call fun filmmaking!"
3,not foil wrapped,These bags are not foil wrapped Not even paper envelope wrapped as thecheaper Lipton bags are more like crammed in the box of 100 naked. Tastes OK though.
3,Post-Rock Pleasure Trip,"A compilation album from a benefit concert in April 2001 in East Sussex, 'All Tomorrow's Parties' is a mellow grooving journey through some of Post-Rock's best artists. The theme of the album is decidedly mellow with a variety of musical directions - jazz,hip-hop,rap. The album is predominantly instrumental but has some very enjoyable vocal explorations.For a fan of Tortoise this album is a must. Their 15+ minute track is pure Tortoise at their best. The haunting track by Black Heart Procession captures their live vibe. Unfortunately, the last two tracks on the album are comprised of mechanical sounds, buzzing,and feedback which left me yearning for a nails-on-the-chalkboard scratch.All in all this album is worth checking out and could expose you to some new and interesting music."
2,Hinges fail--dangerous,"I own this toilet seat and after falling off the toilet because the hinges failed when trying to wipe, I would caution anyone to buy it. It is especially dangerous for the elderly. I wrenched my knee and back in three places trying to catch myself because it was completely unexpected. The hinges pop out of the base and unless you are a very tiny person, you risk that happening when your weight is shifted during wiping. I would recommend anyone looking for a toilet seat to shop for one with chrome hinges. Better yet, one with a bar in the back joining the two hinges together. It adds more stability and less chance of hinge slippage."
5,Great seat,Nicely built tolet seat. I like how fast you can take off tolet seat for cleaning its really fast. Iwould recommend this tolet seat for fussy people.
2,Hard to secure,"I bought this as a replacement for an identical seat (same model number). The seat is pretty, comfortable, and easy to clean;. However, it has a new kind of fastener that is designed so that the seat is supposed to be easy to remove. They tout it as being easy to clean because you can simply pop the seat off to clean it. I have two problems with this. First, after the seat is installed, for me anyway, it is extremely difficult to remove. Second, it is difficult to tighten it adequately (because, on my toilet, the wingnut does not have room to turn and has to be forced) and consequently, the seat gets loose after a short time, but I cannot access the screws to tighten it. I know I didn't explain that well, but the bottom line is, the seat would be great if I could get it to be tight and stay tight, but as is, I am looking to replace it soon."
5,"So far, so good","I have this for already over one month. I bought this to replace to old one (same style) and also to match the ocean scene in the bathroom. I am so glad to find this style in Amazon.com because the local stores don't stock them. If I knew Amazon has this earlier, I would buy another rose style for my upstair bathroom.It came well packed. Installation is easy."
4,A gripping story of endurance and courage wasted,"Although modern writers discussing the events of the Endurance expedition have indeed pretty much forgotten this side of the expedition, it should be pointed out that Sir Ernest Shackleton himself covered it in his own book ""South."" Bickel has used recently found documentation and other materials to put together the complete tale of the Ross Sea Party of the Endurance expedition. After their ship Aurora was pulled away from her moorings by a storm, the men left on shore brilliantly improvised stores and equipment to lay the depots required for the planned crossing the Antarctic continent. During their sledging journeys one man died, and the survivors had to struggle to save two more (who ultimately were lost through their own foolishness in crossing sea ice when a storm threatened). All in all this is a valuable contribution to the story of the Endurance expedition. I also very highly recommend ""Mawson's Will"" by the same author."
5,The Other Chilling Tale of the Endurance Saga,"A well written work that reads like a novel about the members of Shackleton's Ross Sea Party whose mission it was to lay food and supply depots for Shackleton's crossing of Antarctica. The brave men united by adversity, experience such unimaginable hardships, that as the reader I found myself rooting for these brave and courageous men to abandon their mission and save themselves. Their persistance to carry on and complete their mission while enduring every suffering possible of the Antarctic is testament to the true character and grit of these men. For anyone who has read any of the published ""ENDURANCE"" works this book is a must read. The adventure will not be complete until you read this bone chilling tale of the human spirit, unbroken."
4,Howard Rollins was great as Medgar Evers,"This is such a great movie before watching Ghosts of Mississippi (1996), I demand that since MGM owns the rights to this movie, they should release it on DVD. Come on, what are they waiting for, for some strange reason, they have the movie being played on the internet. Do you see anyone willing to spend a $1.99 to play this movie?"
2,Not Worth The Wait,"I waited almost a year from the time that I first read about TuneView USB until it was available. The screen is too small, navigation of a large library is very tedious and limited and it takes 5-10 minutes to sync with my 25,000+ song library each time I launch iTunes. The iPod version is probably more useful for the limited library size. On the positive side, once it is synced, it is very responsive to commands and the range of the remote seems fine in my small house. A larger remote with a number/letter pad (like a telephone) for navigation and a larger screen would make this device more effective with iTunes but the sync issue is a definite deal breaker. A better choice may be theNokia 770 Internet Tablet PCwith PlayerPal or another browser based control applet. Since being replaced by the N800 the 770 is close to the same price and does so much more."
2,Not compatible with Leopard on your mac,"I bought this remote for my home music library. I put it on a mac mini that is hooked up to a TV in my den. I have a 25,000 song library and it took forever to load everything. I thought that there was something wrong with it because it took so long. For an entire day I waited. I finally stopped the loading and checked the Keyspan website only to find out that it's compatibility with Leopard wasn't 100%. I did eventually get my library loaded after I downloaded some new software from Keyspan. Once it is loaded, it works OK. I wasn't overly impressed with it's performance, and for some reason it has caused some problems on my mac mini. I tried it on my macbook pro, with the same results. I guess that it isn't happy with my OS (leopard). I've since removed the software from both computers and will probably put it on ebay to sell it. I wish that someone would have noted this in their reviews because I wouldn't have bought it."
1,"Over priced, unattractive paper weight","Worked as advertised one time then after that intermittently after much screwing around and sometimes having to reboot. Now not at all. Currently waiting for tech support. Not enough info with the product to be of any use to trouble shoot it. Bottom line I own a mac cause they work, I use iTunes to listen to music cause it works, so something that is supposed to be an accessory for these two things needs to do one thing, WORK."
3,"Works good, but....","I like the fact that I can control iTunes remotely, that is great. However, I was hoping that via this remote I would be able to switch the Airport Express station that iTunes is streaming to. I don't see any way to do this - unless I am missing something.That means, if I'm in the basement and want to listen to my iTunes, I have to run upstairs, in the bottom left corner of iTunes change the Airport Express station to ""Basement"", then run back downstairs. I was hoping the remote would have this functionality, since it says ""remotely control iTunes""."
4,Inspiring,"It is unfortunate that Hartmann's achievements are underplayed because he flew against the Soviets: 352 aerial victories, never lost a wingman, survived 10 years in a Soviet prison camp, and created the West German Air Force's first all-jet wing. 'Nuff said."
2,"Great characters, bad writers...","This could have been much better than it actually is!!!! The writers knew hartmann, yet the book sounds tired, lifeless. Written in the appice of the Cold War, the book is full of ideological comtempt for the Soviet. All in all, I think the greatest ace ever (even if we all know that German claims were tremendously overclaimed!!!) deserved a better book."
3,Great book about a WWII German fighter ace,"I enjoyed this book because of the following:1. You learn how he used a different strategy than was popular at the time - he would come in extremely close to the opposing aircraft before firing.2. You will learn about his experiences as a German POW in the Russian POW, then penal, system.3. You will see how interesting it is that, in the author's point-of-view, the German soldiers were so noble, yet their Russian captors were brutal. No mention of German anti-Semitism and concentration camps.It is clear that the author is an admirer of the Blond Knight.I give this book three stars because the reading was a little tedious and the author's writing was a little too subjective and fawning for me. Other than that it is a great book."
3,Only the second half saves the book from being average,"I was not as impressed with this book as everyone else seems to be. I found the first half of the book, which describes Erich's early life and entry into the air force, as well as some of his aerial battles, to be a bit bland. Not that it was boring, it simply did not offer enough nail-biting reading excitement for me.Only the second half of the book which went into detail with respect to Erich's confinement in Russia made the book an excellent read. The detail which Toliver describes is harrowing. It is unbelieveable that the Russians would keep a flyer, such as Erich, in prison as long as they did. And the tricks they used to try and break someone was quite astonishing. I felt that this portion of the book was so much more interesting than the first half."
3,Good book but details are missing,"Maybe because it was written soon after the War, in the fifties, this book is an anticlimax, since it's dealing with the life of the most sucessful fighter pilot of all times. The technical part is almost zero, and there's too much room for Erich in the hands of Soviet guards and prisons. Anyway, it gives a general portrait of Luftwaffe in the East."
4,It's a Seiko!,"I bought this watch for my 80 yr old mom. My only complaint is with the leather strap...it's too short! Because this watch is so small thesize 10 Long strap is almost impossible to find. I finally found one, you guessed it, back on Amazon....from an independent seller. I've had the men's version of the same watch for years. No problems with it, ever!"
4,A must for any Civil War buff!,"Historian Chris Calkins does a marvelous job re-creating the last days of the war in this vivid and well-written work. Mr. Calkins, who was a historian at Appomattox and now is the Park Historian at Petersburg National Battlefield, uses his years of experience and knowledge of the last campaign of the War to construct an excellent narrative that explains the final fight for Petersburg and Grant's pursuit of Lee to Appomattox. Excellent maps and superb sidebars on general officers on both sides. I wish he went more in depth on the battles, though. The ""bible"" for the last week of the War!"
2,"Love the music, not a fan of the DVD","About the only use for this DVD is the music (which is, of course, also available on CD). Truly, the visuals are horrid. The source-material must be in VERY rough shape-- the DVD is sub-VHS quality in terms of image. As somebody who never had a chance to see any of the Foetus-incarnations perform live, I was very much looking forward to seeing what a typical show would've been like 'back-in-the-day'. This document surely isn't an accurate representation.The sound is decent-enough. There's a 5.1 mix on here that doesn't do much to seperate the channels-- they seem to have added a bit of echoey-sound to the rear channels to simulate 'surround'.Disappointing."
4,Highly Entertaining! Thought Provoking,"""This highly entertaining and thought-provoking series is designed to be used by teachers who love American history.""LINDA R SKEELE, SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL"
4,Hey teachers!,"I highly recommend this video series for classroom use. The clever use of shadow puppetry and catchy songs engages students in a unique way. If you download the lyrics from ..., your students can learn the lyrics for even better retention of historical facts. I also use the USKids History books as a supplement to my classroom texts. These are available at Amazon.com as well. I found all of these items very useful in modifying content for the English Language Learners in my classroom."
2,My engine is not covered,I bought this book expecting my 1990 Johnson 88HP engine to be covered. This book does not even list any 88 HP Johnson engines. I am very dissappointed with it.
1,One step from useless,"Very little,incomplete, general information. Nothing specific about any of the engines listed. If you need a manual for a service or repair procedure that you have never done, look elsewhere! Also, the type set looks like someone typed it on a ""1928 Underwood"" typewriter."
3,Manual acceptable but never updated,This manual helps with most issues on outboards but the trouble shooting refers to test devices that were made when many of the outboards were first produced - like 1980. It's not like the motor has changed but if you try and follow their guide you will find references to test lights that have not been in production for over 20 years.The pages look like they are copies of copies. Some are getting a little faded.
4,4 stars,Book is okay. Not as descriptive as I would like. Usefull for many basic repairs. Pictures could be better as well.
2,Not detailed enough.,"Too general! Although packed with good info, I wish it was more detailed on specific model coverage. Picures/graphics were from the 80's."
2,Disapointing for a Nancy Drew game,Seems like they just huried this game. Too much running around to get answers. The phone did not even have web acsess. Actually i did not like it at all.
2,It's a dud.,"My jaw dropped when I realized I was done with this game, it went so fast. There weren't nearly as many clues to find as some of the other games, and of the games that were set up within the mystery, most were not relevant to solving the case! This game is a let down in comparison to other Nancy Drew games."
2,Disappointing!,"My favorites are still Scarlet Hand and Deception Island- and I also loved most of the others- but these last few in the series have just gone so far downhill that I doubt I will by the newest one. Hard to believe, because I have been a diehard fan of the games..."
3,Not Bad,"I certainly enjoyed this game, and while I did like Danger By Design a little better, I preferred the slightly lower level of difficulty for Creature of Kapu Cave. I was slightly disappointed--I had high hopes for this game and was slightly let down. Only one Hardy Boy was really available and some parts of the game were very unclear, such as examining everything around Island Mike's desk--I assumed this meant look ON the desk, and in gameplay you are unable to do so.But all in all it was a grand effort carried out well. I liked the expansion of locations and of course applaud the graphics--the ocean coming in waves was beautifully done."
2,Major disappountment,"short,boring,and any one with an IQ above 70 can solve it. makes you miss real adventure gamesto sum it up, if Her Intractive continued producing such games, i will definitly will not buy any more"
2,Disappointment,"Both this game and Danger by Design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games (Shadow Ranch, the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, Secret of the Old Clock, etc.). The game was short, and I thought the tasks were a bit dull. I also found it somewhat confusing switching between Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys. Hopefully Her Interactive will produce something better next time, because these games really are addictive, even for adults."
2,Not Like the Others,"What a person expects from the Nancy Drew games is to have your mind challenged by the actual game play. You learn things about a particular subject, and you find yourself diving into a world where you make the choices and you get to solve the mystery.To me, ""The Creature of Kapy Cave"" was a major disapointment. I was really fearful that other games in the series would end up being like this, lacking any sort of challenge to it. I mean, when I played the game, I instantly understood why they were able to for once include the walkthrough with it for once! Nice insentive to get people to still buy the game, but it really isn't.This game, if you aren't interested in having ALL the Nancy Drew games, I honestly suggest not buying. Unless of course you are getting the game for an introduction to a much younger child then you normally would suggest it for."
2,Disappointed,"I've played a lot of these games. I'm not ashamed to say I love Nancy Drew. This particular game, however, was terrible. The plot was weird, the characters were annoying, the puzzles were repetetive and even the character graphics (which usually redeem the less-than-awesome ones) were much weaker than I would ever expect from a Nancy Drew game. The only part I was interested in was the Hardy Boys. I love seeing them in Nancy Drew games. Unfortunately, they were barely even in this one. Sure, you get to play as them, but that doesn't make up for the suspicious lack of Hardy Boy face visibility. So far definitely my least favorite of these games by far, other than maybe the first two, which I can forgive because they were...well, the first two.Don't let your experience with this game color your opinion of any other Nancy Drew game."
4,this is for 10 and up????,i am ejoying this game now that i have the cheat sheet. otherwise i would just have quit. IT IS HARD!!!! how can this be rated for 10 and up?
2,One of the worst Nancy Drew games.,I was very disappointed with this game. I played all of the ND mystery games and I'm a big fan. This was a short game and not interesting. Nancy Drew's assignment was looking through bug waste and counting and weighting whatever she found. The only thing I liked was playing as Hardy boys when Nancy Drew called them on the phone.
4,A little short...,"My favorite in the Nancy Drew series, Legend of the Crystal Skull. The most difficult, Curse of Blackmoor Manor. The Creature of Kapu Cave is an OK game. It seems like Herinteractive was maybe in a rush to produce another Nancy Drew game and they didn't really take the time to make this a very challenging game. The scenery was really nice. When playing a Nancy Drew game, I always make sure I have plenty of paper and a pencil. You will definitely need them. The most paper I used was Curse of Blackmoor Manor. The least-Creature of Kapu Cave. But, I can't wait for the next one to come out!!"
3,Not up to the normal quality,"I was a little disappointed with ""The Creature of Kapu Cave"". First, it wasn't very challenging, second, the activities were not much fun, and third, it didn't take very long to finish. I have all of the Nancy Drew games and this was my least favorite. The one thing that was interesting and fun was that we switched from Nancy to one of the Hardy boys."
2,Disappointed,"My daughter and I have played all of the previous games; we've enjoyed them overall. Some of the games are fantastic, challenging and fun. This game was quite lame in comparison to the others. The puzzles weren't really puzzling, just boring tasks. There were not many clues to find. Because there weren't many clues, there was no real sense of detecting anything. The game ended abruptly and was very short. We did NOT use a walk-through to solve the mystery in record time, just experienced a lack of challenge. We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally. The rest was pretty boring. If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game, try one of the others instead."
4,Great Idea But the Game Didn't Live Up to It,"I love all the Nancy Drew games, and The Creature of Kapu Cave was not a disapointment. It was a little short, and some of the tasks were booooring, but overall CRE was a really good game. I bought it from Her Interactive ASAP and it was worth it! It was a little slow-moving but still very good. You get to play as the Hardy Boys too by calling them on your cellphone. I didn't like that part much but whatevs. I definatley reccomend buying CRE!"
2,Too short for the money......VERY disappointed!!!!!!!,"I have played every Nancy Drew game that has come out, and I have never been this disappointed!! This was too short, and you didn't even know what the people had done who were arrested in the end!! The story line was good. Seems like it should have really went somewhere, but no, it didn't. The puzzles were too simple (and believe you me, I have the most trouble with puzzles). Very disappointed in HER Interactive! Don't rush it next time...it's better to wait for a great one, than to get it fast and beat it too fast."
1,Disappointed- Didn't work,"When I downloaded this game it would freeze on the opening image. I tried downloading it again and troubleshooting it several times and it still would not work, so I contacted Her Interactive. Apparently this is a known problem on newer computers, and yet there is no warning on this or any other site regarding what they referred to as a ""known problem.""Despite me contacting Her Interactive about how unfair this is as a customer, they have not done anything to refund me or remedy the situation in any way. Know that if you purchase this game, it may not work, and you will have wasted your money like I did."
1,Disappointed Long-Time Nancy Drew Fan...,"Alright, so maybe my husband and I aren't exactly in the target audience for the Nancy Drew games, but nonetheless, we've enjoyed playing every single one of the previous thirteen releases. So, after waiting anxiously for their fourteenth, perhaps it goes without saying that I was extremely disheartened upon receiving it to discover that we can't play it. HER Interactive has decided apparently that they care more about Microsoft than their long-time customers and have chosen to support only Windows XP and Vista instead of any of the older operating systems. The company had a very unsatisfactory response to my dilemma, and so I'll be doubly careful next time to read the fine print of the system requirements."
3,The Creature of Kapu Cave,"This is certainly one of the weakest games in the series. Since The Curse of Blackmoor Manor, which was heavily criticized for being too difficult, it seems that the designers at Her Interactive have decided to err in the other direction. The puzzles are overly easy, and require little or no deductive reasoning. They also tend to be centered on chores that you must complete to advance in the game, but that otherwise bring you no closer to solving the mystery. This becomes very tedious, very quickly.The dialogue is limited and generally uninteresting, and, as in all the recent games, the game play is too short. Finally, despite the incessant talk about surfing and surfing lessons in the game, we are never given the opportunity hit the waves ourselves. Cruel joke, Her Interactive!The graphics, however, are beautiful, as always."
2,Worst Nancy game,"I've played nearly all of these Nancy games and this one was the worst. I have enjoyed every game I have played except this one. What happened to finding the clues and solving some puzzles? This game just seemed to be filled with tedious time wasting tasks. I can't say too much more without spoiling it for others who want to try, so I'll just leave you with my humble opinion."
1,did not download!,after waiting for at least three hours for it to completely download and being a big Nancy Drew game fan I was very disappointed to learn that the game did not work it would pause every time I would open it so if you are thinking of downloading this game my advice to you would be don't!
3,Average game at best,"I have been playing ND games ever since..... This unfortunately was not one of my favorites. It was a quick play game as I completed it in one day. For the positive remarks, graphics great, no problems playing or installing (i.e. hate having to have the disk in drive to play!!), puzzles were fun and entertaining and not too difficult.I like the idea of playing between Nancy and the Hardy boys. Characters were so-so though and the ending wasn't played out very well. There was many places that I expected to have to go but they were never a part of the game.It was worth playing once."
3,Too short,The game was fun but really short. Compared to some of the previous games this was too easy. Liked the switching between Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE OTHER N DREW GAMES,"It was too easy, so it went by too quickly. I had it fnished in no time."
3,Too Short,"We own all of the Nancy Drew CD-Rom games and this game was very short compared to the others. The graphics were good, the characters were good, but the game play was not long at all. Both of my girls finished the game in record time and were also disappointed with the ending itself."
2,Way Too Short...,"If this is your first Nancy drew game, this is a good choice...however if you have played them before this may be disappointing. While the graphics, and scenery are beautiful (and what initially attracted me to the game), it was a little too easy and ended way too soon. They didn't take time to develop the story, but explained it only after you have solved the game. Also not enough characters. I will say that being able to switch between playing the hardy boys and nancy was a neat concept, you really didn't have enough time to enjoy it before the game was over."
4,"Short, But Sweet","My friend and I have completed all the Nancy Drew games together. Here's what we thought of Creature of Kapu Cave: Loved the Hawaiian scenery (especially on a cold, gray Oregon winter day), the characters are well developed, and the most fun was to switch between Nancy and the Hardy Boys point of view. The puzzles were not hard and were very similar to ones in past games. It didn't take very long to complete the game, but all in all it was a pleasurable experience. However, if HerInteractive does not come up with some really different approaches in the future, I think we will get bored and not order any more Nancy Drew games."
2,Anticlimactic,Worst Ending Ever!! I was expecting at least a chase or something! Very Disappointing!
3,Great Fun (While It Lasted),"This was one of the most enjoyable Nancy Drew games we've played in a long while. The graphics are the best ever, the voice acting, as usual, is very good (Frank Hardy excepted), and the puzzles are fun and fit nicely into the story line. It was also very cool to be able to switch between playing as Nancy or one of the boys. Very cleverly done. But for 20 bucks, you absolutely do not get your money's worth in playing time. I would suggest that Heractive either start making these games twice as long or start charging half as much if they want to maintain their fan base."
2,Another lousy game in a long string,"Yet another utter disappointment from Her Interactive. This game, while considerably better than Danger by Design, is yet another boring, time-wasting game in a long string of Nancy Drew inspired PC games. What happened to the creativity and intrigue of The Curse of Blackmoor Manor, or The Secret of the Scarlet Hand? Get your old game creators back Her Interactive! Your four most recent game STINK! I've completely lost interest in ND computer games since The Secret of the Old Clock, and just sold my entire collection in our yard sale. The Creature of Kapu Cave had no substance whatsoever. I played, lost interest because nothing was happening, and then solved the case without any of the excitement that I used to have for past games. This is the last one I'm ever going to buy. My interest in Nancy Drew games is officially expired."
1,A hot mess,The graphics are really nice BUT: The games is too short and there aren't many puzzles. The puzzles that are in the game are very easy. It took me 8 hours to finish this game. The ending is a hot mess.Spolier Alert:Nancy doesn't solve the mystery. She just walks in on it. As Nancy you basically sort through frass the whole game.
4,Pretty good,"I liked this game a lot. It was neat because I'm from Hawaii so it was kinda cool. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because the game isn't completely clear on what you need to do at times. There were times that I found it more interesting to play Joe Hardy on the beach rather than not know what to do with Nancy. The tasks that Quigly gives Nancy aren't very clear. She doesn't give her very good directions, so you might need to find a walkthrough for those parts.I liked the new graphics and the new features. Having Frank and Joe Hardy was a good addition. The graphics were wonderful. It was also an interesting plot. Overall this is a good game, my only complaint is that it's not very clear at times of what you're supposed to do."
1,so so,"The game seemed to start off like any other Nancy Drew game. My daughter has played them all. However, after a while, it seemed as thow it was an easter egg hunt for three year olds. Everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all. All the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery. However, this game took her two days. All the other Nancy Drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more. This game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed. In fact, her words at the end of the game were, ""that's it?"". Her interactive, better come out with a more interesting game next time or you'll lose the interest."
1,"Sadly, my review is not the best...","I have been a long time Nancy Drew PC game fan. This recent game in the Nancy Drew series was not an example of Her Interactive's better games in the series. First of all, this game was very short unlike many of the other older games that had 25hour game play time. The graphics are getting better with each game, but this seems to come at the expense to the plot and clarity of the mystery at hand. This review is also reflective of the outstanding disapproval of the game that preceeded, Danger by Design. Danger was not well received by many long time ND fans. I recommend going on to Her Interative's game board to get a better picture of what the fans have to say, and then decide for yourself.I recommend this game for children ages 10-13. If you are either a mature player who someone who grew up with the series, I do not recommend this game for purchase."
2,disappointment again for Nancy Drew fans,"Her Interactive started the Nancy Drew computer game series with wonderful, complicated, and fun games such as ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" and ""Secret of the Scarlet Hand"" and ""Danger on Deception Island"". Now the games are too easy, too short, and the characters completely forgetable. This game has a promising start, but there are virtually no puzzles to solve--- only repetitive tasks. The ending is one of the worst. Her Interactive needs to remember that it is the story, characters, and puzzles that will keep fans purchasing its games. Like ""Danger by Design"", this was a waste of my money."
2,Disappointed,"This was the easiest and most disappointing Nancy Drew game. I have all of the others and very much enjoyed them. This, however, was not up to par with the others. I was expecting a lot more considering the location and the addition of the Hardy Boys. Didn't get my money's worth out of this one. Less to do and not as much dialogue. They could have really worked it. Talked about the Hardy Boys learning to surf, but never incorporated that into the story. Not a lot of game play hours. I never finished any game this fast."
2,Flashy graphics but over in a flash,"I've played every Nancy Drew game and I was so excited to get this one for Christmas! Too bad I was done by the end of the day. The game was so easy to complete if you are familiar with Nancy Drew games. I was shocked when it ended. Seems like HerInteractive wanted the game out for the Christmas season and ran out of time to develop a good quality game with complex puzzles and a good story-line. If the game was truly developed, Nancy wouldn't have to talk for three minutes at the end to explain to us users what really happened. We would have figured most of it out in our detective work in the game!! Cool new features: GPS and Hardy Boy Switch. I hope this doesn't mean the end of a winning streak for the Nancy Drew series."
3,Kapu Cave,"I was anticipating this game very much. I've played all of the ND games, but this didn't seem as good as the rest. Normally it takes me at least 3 days to beat a game, I beat this one in only a little over 5 hour. I was excited to get to see the Hardy boys again, especially Joe, but he's barely in the game. You only get to play as hime for about ten minutes. The mystery was rather confusing, I still don't even really understand what Nancy was trying to figure out. And the game was pretty easy, I only had trouble on one puzzle and I quickly solved it. There were only about to major puzzles to do in this game. I like the part where you get to snoop around the research center. I'm glad Her Interactive let Nancy snoop around again. All in all Kapu Cave was a really short and easy game. I hope the next one will be a bit longer and harder."
2,Way too short and repetitive!,"The review by Bovey is spot-on! These games have gotten more boring as they go. The majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over....how much is enough? There was no real sense of scariness or danger... just boredom! And the game was so short... suddenly it ended! I am so disappointed in what these games have become. I loved The Final Scene, I even liked Blackmoor Manor even though I could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough. This game was just lame. I don't recommend paying full price for it."
4,Fun In Kapu Cave,"I found this game a lot of fun to play and the part about switching from Nancy's POV to that of Frank or Joe Hardy added another level of adventure. Sadly, I think it was a bit too easy to solve and didn't take me as long as usual. However, I was playing at the Junior Detective level and still have the Senior level to work on!"
3,Some singles are not needed...,"I love TMBG, and I have bought many of their singles and ep's, but this one was not really needed. The songs are good, but then again, TMBG rarely write a bad song, but none of them on here are really important to know. Not their best, but if you are a collector, more power to you, check it out!"
2,Terribly Disappointed,"I've read and loved all of Ms. Goldberg's books, but this one was a huge disappointment. I've never read such rotten poetry, I'm very sad to say. The art work was good, but childish. This book has nothing in common with the glowing editorial review here at Amazon. I would never have purchased this book if I'd looked it over in a book store. If you want a good book by Ms. Goldberg, buy ""Wild Mind"" or ""Writing Down the Bones""."
1,Don't bother,"This is just a collection of the awful webtoons featuring the Looney Tunes characters. The animation is bad (the same clip-art poses you've seen before...) and the characters aren't acting like themselves. Why Warner Brothers is releasing this I do not know. Save your money for the Looney Tunes Golden Collection - 4 discs of uncut classic Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, with many extra features."
3,"Not great, but not as bad as some would say.","Not as good as ""Looney Tunes: Reality Check,"" and not even remotely as good as ""Looney Tunes: The Golden Collection,"" this set of 21 new Looney Tunes shorts are, for the most part, send-ups of science fiction and horror films and television shows. The animation is pretty bad -- it's clear that you're watching low-budget webtoons rather than the great stuff Warner Bros is capable of putting out, but the writing is pretty sharp and the characters are dead-on. I honestly don't know where some of the bile some reviewers have for this and ""Reality Check"" comes from.It's not great by any stretch of the imagination, but it's okay. It would have been easier to swallow, however, if the WB had condensed this and ""Reality Check"" into one two-hour DVD instead of two one-hours DVDs."
1,Save Your Money,"Garbage, plain and simple. Simply product with no concern for quality or substance. Buy the LOONEY TUNES GOLDEN COLLECTION instead. I only got a copy of STRANGER THAN FICTION because of the store coupon which enabled me to get it free. My five year old liked it. I'm not so sure she'll like it when she's six. I thought Disney watered down their product, but this is just embarrassing."
1,"Awful - if you love the old stuff, stay away","If you, like me, love the old (""classic"" ?) looney tunes,DO NOT BUY this one. I bought an earlier one (GoldenClassics or some such title) and I (and my wife and children)loved (most) of the earlier DVD. We did not even finish thisDVD, and we will not. None liked it. It seems that therewas one (1) episode we regarded as almost ok, but that's it.If you like whereever this stuff came from fine, but beaware that this is lightyears differernt from the classics."
1,The cover art on this says it all!,With releases like this worthless DVD...WARNER BROTHERS is Looney. What were they thinking? My kids don't even like these cartoons.
5,It's funny,I saw this DVD and it's funny. The cartoons are short and sweet. It's good to see Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck in new cartoons and more modern situations. I liked it very much.
5,Fun and works well,"Have only had this installed for about a week, but has worked well so far. Our friends like it a lot and looks super cool, works well with the catcher."
2,Not a fan,"Ended up just skimming the book - loved the title, but reality was I didn't need any of the advice. Some silly ideas and probably won't use the book."
1,Was sent the wrong book,I was sent a book from 1983. I bought this book based off of the USB which must be wrong because the book I needed was published in 2009.
3,Don't come in expecting the movie,"Sol Yurick admits in the author's notes that he wrote The Warriors while he was waiting for his real book to get published. I'm not going to say it's second rate, there are pieces that show inspiration, but it's not the epic I was expecting. Being a solid fan of the movie, I had to read it. After hearing it was based on Xenophon's Anabasis, I was doubly excited to get my hands on it. Now that I've read it, I wasn't thrilled. It's a story well-told, just not the story I was expecting or seeking."
5,the warriors,cool book quite different from the film..and as a fan wasnt expecting it.charachters in the book put a relatively new twist on my perception of it both film and book.good though.
3,"Not as good as the movie, but...","The biggest point to be made; this isn't much like the movie. There aren't many fights in it, and it spends more time describing the lives of the Family and everyone around them instead of describing any action.It does have it's merits though. It is a fantastic description on life of lost souls, wandering teenagers and the like. It shows some complete turns of character, including one young man who comes upon maturity, both real and ""manhood"" maturity, in the course of one night.Mixing the slow parts with the action, this book warrants three stars out of five."
1,Overhyped Yawn,"A boring piece of tripe. As is often the case with ""cult"" novels, the fanboys grossly overrate them, skew the composite, and fool people into buying them. The cheap graphics of the book cover are indicative of what's inside. To say the movie was better, much better, is an understatement. The novel only survives in print because of the movie -- that's why I bought it. I suppose the book was controversial in the early 1960s because of its amoral tone and four lettered language -- and the controversy sold the book. If THE WARRIORS was first published today, it wouldn't sell a 100 copies. A lame plot line, unsympathetic characters, very little action, and a fizzle at the end. What a disappointment!"
1,not like the movie,"Too much street gang mentality,I know that is what it suppose to be about,but it was hard to feel sorry for the characters. The movie was a lot betterand a lot more entertaining.The characters in the movie of course couldn't do what the book did but that's Ok like it better that way..."
2,Not the movie,"I am a huge fan of The Warriors movie. Sol Yurick, The Warriors, is not what you expect if you have seen the movie first. I am not saying it is a lousy book, but wow, the movie adaption is so much better. I say stick to the movie. Usually, I find the books to be so much better but in this case...I have to give in to the movie.Walter Hill's The Warriors is AWESOME!!! The book's cover will make you think of the movie tie in...but that is not the case. I own the book, enough said."
1,I found it boring and long in the tooth,"This is a case of going overboard on detail. I found it stupid at times and boring. The characters had very little appeal to the reader, even though they are bad guys, sometimes you can still relate. The subway ride was drawn out and the final conclussion had no substance"
1,NOT an insightful book about street gangs of the 1960s,"This book is about an all-black gang from the 1960s. It was written by a Jewish professional in his 40s. I dont think he had a lot of personal experience about the subject, if any. He loosely based the theme of the book on an Ancient Greek story. So, if anybody thinks this book comes from a guy with experience about gang-life, guess again. There's a rape scene in the book too, that I could definately have done without."
1,poorly constructed- easily broken,"I received this puzzle broken. The baby elephants trunk is quite slender and was broken in half. I'm requesting a replacement, however, I'm afraid that even if we receive it intact that my 1 year old could easily and accidentally break it just by holding it, thus creating a choking hazard. It's unfortunate, I was really excited about this puzzle. Also, it is much smaller than I imagined."
3,Yonder: A Place in Montana,"This is the biography of a place. John Heminway and his sister, in search of a western Montana fishing cabin for their family, purchase a run-down cabin that had once been part of a 2,000-acre ranch called the Bar 20. This book is about Heminway's experiences there and, mostly, about the history he discovers of the people who had been there before. It is the story of Montana as a place of dreams and disappointments and of vivid yearning memory."
3,Nice but not folk.,This one might grow on me. the arrangements are pretty generic - most of the songs sound the same - but she seems to have more talent than the other females late for the ditzy Lilith Fair craze.... if i really don't like it in a week i'll just give it to a Jewel fan...
4,Nice surprise!,"I bought this CD with great apprehension. I've never heard of Miranda Lee, but she kept coming up in my recommendations. Then I read a short review of 'The herethereafter' in Blender Magazine that was quite positive -- so I figured, why not give it a try?Well, I must say it was a very nice surprise indeed! What a great little album this is. The songs are very sweet, a sort of folk-y pop, but yet with very, very smart lyrics.The music is very well performed -- she plays an absurd amount of instruments in this record -- and while there's not much real virtuosity in it, it does come across as quite solid and imaginative.This is not sugar-y brainless pop, but rather a very smart production. Perfect for listening on your car stereo or at home, and even better to put it on and just let it play while reading a book or doing house chores."
2,don't believe the hype,"I bought this album on a whim, hoping for the best. I sat in the car with my also-hopeful boyfriend, silent while listening to the first two tracks, when he finally turned to me and said, 'This sounds like Wilson Phillips.' We ran right back to the store and exchanged it. Predictable pop is not my kind of thing. We really wanted to like this album... the layout is terrific. Richards does seem to have potential, but seems afraid to take real chances."
4,Credible,"Another peoples champion with partial insider knowledge trying to work out why the establishment are covering up/avoiding the UFO issue. This ordered thesis is a slice of UFO investigation from 30 years ago - have we moved on? not really. Very much along the lines of Donald Keyhoe and his crusade to highlight the circus that was called the Condon Report. This is someone who sounds credible, more so than our governments. Another essential for Ufoligists"
3,Mediocre at best,"This book, while very well put together was disappointing to me. The book is full of beautiful pictures but it lacked the classic italian recipes. Having never dined at the Tribeca Grill, I would expect it to be a wonderful restaurant. The recipes are, for the most part overcomplicated. The beauty of Italian cuisine is it's simplicity. That seems to get lost in the majority of the recipes. For the level of difficulty, the recipes that I've tried were a bit underwhelming. Many restaurants have their house recipes and then they have the recipes that are shared in their cookbooks. I cannot say for sure but I would suspect that this is the case with this book."
3,seat,"It works, however it is so heavy it crashes when it is closed. BAM! It is also so thick it won't stay open and falls by it's self. The old seat we had was thinner inside and lighter material for the board used. This seems to be a regular seat that was just padded. It would have worked just as well if it was only half that thick to begin with.It is comfortable and the color is nice.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RGPGBU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,"Delighted, then Disappointed...","When I first received and installed this toilet seat, I was very pleased. I've purchased several Bemis seats and have always been satisfied. This one look like it might be even better -- the easy clean and change hinge is a nice feature.But within a month, one of the seams on the seat split and continues to split to the point now where I'm thinking it will have to be replaced soon for cleanliness reasons. The tear-split seam is now approaching about 3 inches. Not good and the result -- very disappointed."
2,nice seat,I liked this seat right from the start. had a good feel to it. I was a little disapointed that it only lasted about 6 months before the vynl cracked. then the only thing to do with it was toss it.I guess iwas disapointed in the durability.my wife has one on her toilet
5,Mayfair soft elongated toilet seat,"So far so good. It fit the toilet, and it was easier to put on than the previous one. Now the only question is durability, and the answer to that will take time."
1,Whimpy cushion,I was hoping for the price that I would receive a very firm pad for the seat...WRONG...I would not recommend this toilet seat to anyone. 2 days after installing there is wiggle-room and I feel the cold comode on my semi-zoftig thighs...Burrrr. I'm going to search for a firmer padded seat to gently cradle my buttocks...
4,No title,"I'm sure this is an excellant item if this is what one wants, but since I returned as a misidentified item on my part, I cannot evaluate."
3,Overall OK Throne Seat,"Overall this is an OK seat for the price. After some moderate use it has developed an irritating tear in the side where the seam is but for [that price,] what do you expect."
4,Soft but so thick it doesn't always stay up,"Boys beware, this seat can fall down long after one has put it up for male usage.Other than that, it's soft, well made and easy to clean."
2,Seam coming apart just shy of 3 months,"I bought this Bemis deluxe elongated toilet seat on April 21,2012. At first, it was a nice seat and we liked the easy clean and change hinge. But, on July 17th, we noticed their was a crack in the seam which is increasing in length each day. I would think that this seat should have lasted longer than just shy of 3 months. If I had known that this seat was only going to last less than 3 months, I would NEVER have bought this seat."
5,sublime,"i already know the music of Chris De Burgh, but after listen this album i have no doubt about his musical qualities"
3,Cursory,"You can't help but enjoy anything Jack Canfield does because he's so amiable and nice. This film, though, barely scrapes the surface of anything important, and in my opinion wasn't worth the price of the rental."
5,Awesome philosophy book,"Really is such a great resource for someone wanting to understand why we look at the environment as we do, and how we can go about changing the way we think and perceive the natural environment. Highly recommend! ****"
3,"Slow delivery, Questionable Condition.","It took several weeks for the book to arrive and when it did it was, in my opinion, in worse condition than the description claimed. It wasn't dysfunctional, but if you are a stickler for the quality of condition I would be wary or question the descriptions given. Then again, it could have been a one time thing and I was just a little disappointed a chunk of the pages fell out when I opened the book."
4,Pretty silver earrings.,"Ok, when I saw the term dangle - I thought that they dangled - but they are really stationary. That kind of disappointed me, but they are still very pretty and look quite nice when they are on. They are not too heavy - but they have a weight to them, enought to know they are there. I'm glad I purchased them and will look to see what the company offers in the future."
2,Black residue,"I got my earrings today, and wow, what a disappointment! There is a lot of black residue in every low point of the design as well as on the ear wire back and parts of the higher elevations on the design. I understand that the ""antiquing"" process will darker certain areas in the lower parts of the design for a more shadowy effect, but its all over these. I even cleaned them in silver cleaner and with a polishing cloth, nothing is taking it off.I am returning and looking elsewhere for some earring like there. Its too bad because other than that one issue I like the style a lot. Maybe it is just my bad luck with amazon in general but I don't think I will be buying jewelry again from amazon. I'll go to a local shop here and probably get a better deal than 30 bucks for not much silver."
3,Hardware did not fit well.,"The toilet seat is beautiful but after installing the bolts and the bolt covers, the seat cover could only lift half way. I had to remove the bolt covers to lift up the seat cover. Now when the seat cover is down, the bolts are visible, not very pretty to look at."
2,gamera teams up with a genius boyscout to save the earth from an alien octopus,"Can they succeed? Is more of the nature of Gamera revealed? Can the aliens use Gamera's brainwaves and memories against her? Will the boy scout's older sister ever come to a true understanding of his nature? Does this rival Ed Wood for cheesy effects? What was Gamera's origin? What were the worst threats that she faced (i.e. as in repeating the best of old fights)? Does she still like humans? Can humans ever regain their trust in her after the alines take over her mind? Why is she protecting the Earth? Can she replace the nice warm space in our hearts that Godzilla occupies?If you MUST know the answers to these questions, I would recommend this."
1,This is a badly edited version of 2 good films,"I was looking forward to finally obtaining a clear copy of 2 movies from the Gamera series. Unfortunately, this DVD has been edited and takes away some of the best scenes from both films. In Attack of the monsters, Gamera Battles Gurion (a dog like creature with a knife for a head). There is a scene missing that went under the editing knife with this creature fighting another flying monster called a Gyaos. The Gyaos meets an untimely death and is literally hacked to pieces by Gurion. It is a shame that this scene was deleted. I'll stick with my laserdisc copy that I have. You can find my DVD for sale soon on EBAY."
4,Good Veggies,"This is a good Christmas video, but I don't feel it is up there with some of the other Veggie videos. My 2 year old is a huge Bob and Larry fan and she was not very interested in the video. I thought the songs were a bit weak compared to some of the other videos. However, if you are looking for a good Christmas video, it is a great choice. If It is your first venture into the crisper, I would suggest King George and the Ducky, or Lyle the Kindly Viking."
3,Great message--mediocre music,"I am a big veggie tales fan and I did enjoy this movie. I believe that the message is wonderful--well done and easy to understand. However, the music was not nearly as enjoyable as the other veggie tales and therefore, my kids don't enjoy watching this movie as much as some of the others. The bottom line is this--if my kids don't enjoy it, the best message in the world gets lost."
2,Just Okay,"Veggie Tales are hit or miss! My 2 year old loves ""hero's of the bible"" and ""autotainment"" but this video drags. Although there are silly songs and an equally silly premise it just doesn't work. I also expected a more blatant message on the meaning of Christmas. The message is there, don't get me wrong but I just expected more."
4,"Nice, also try the ""Christmas ANIMALS""","The Star of Christmas is a fun story, not quite up to the other Veggie's, but well worth it.FOr story and song conent of the CHristmas story, I slightly prefer The CHRISTMAS ANIMALS, but go ahead and get them both."
2,short on Saturday morning fun,"More preachy and less funny than the other Veggietale stories. No Silly Song or Qwerty, only two musical numbers."
5,Egan gives 'neo formalism' a huge boost!,"Moira Egan is one of the few neo-formalists whose lush, exquisitely crafted, risk-taking poetry evokes words like ""juicy"" rather than ""fusty."" Rooted thematically in all the major meanings of ""cleave"" (including the seemingly opposite ""adhere to"" and ""divide""), Egan's poetry's rich language explores both meaning and sound with intellectual and artistic profundity, yet manages to speak to a reader's human-ness and (I'll just go ahead and dare to say it--)to GIVE PLEASURE. YES, EVEN ENTERTAIN.--Clarinda HarrissProfessor of English, Towson UniversityEditor/director of BrickHouse Books, Inc."
3,Buy the orginal here on Amazon - search same name.,This is a VHS quality transfer from the original Hawaiian Zen DVD from Powerfloe Network (not Slingshot) here on amazon.com. Spend a little extra money and get the better one for your collection.
3,Cute,"I made the mistake of not noticing the size of the watch. thought it was going to be larger, but all in all, still a cute watch."
4,Who do You Trust?,"At first I thought this book was too much about finances, investments, and designing, etc.As I got into the book, I enjoyed it more and more. Surely Jeff Doyle is an expert in contracting and financing but he also writes an interesting story, developing his characters so you can see them clearly.I found heroes to like and dispicable characters to hate, what more could you ask for."
3,Jealous of Cassie Barnell's legacy?,"Compared to ""SHE SAID YES"" I found Rachel's tears dry and overkill on her parent's description of how wonderful Rachel was, plus on p 90 when they discuss the controversy over whether Cassie really did say ""Yes"" I wonder what is the point of putting that in there- to down play Cassie's story to show that Rachel was more martyr then Cassie?! Cassie's story is a fascinating account of how a kid from a good family can go bad- and then get turned around again. I recommend that even more."
1,Deeply disturbing,"According to Rachel's parents, the God they believe in fore-told and allowed the slaughter of innocents so that His message of love and redemption could be spread around the world. What a disturbing image that creates. It certainly is not a God I care to worship. They claim to quote Rachel's journals, in which they believe she wrote of God's prophecy about her coming death and the death of twelve others. If these are indeed Rachel's journals, it's possible that she was experiencing some type of premonition. How disturbing to think that she did not feel confident enough to tell someone. We cannot speculate about what might have happened, but to know that she kept such feelings to herself begs the question ""Why?"" Finally, the self-promotion of her parents and people like Bruce Porter at her innocent expense is the most disturbing element of all. Rachel, like the others, did not deserve to die. Neither does she deserve this continuing exploitation by people who love her."
1,Don't kid yourselves.,"What happened to Rachel Scott at Columbine was a tragedy, but calling her a martyr is an insult to the memories of all the other people who died that day. The killers asked Rachel if she believed in God because they thought it sounded cool, nothing more. How do you explain why they killed everyone else? Trust me, they didn't put any thought into it, and Rachel would have been shot no matter what answer she gave them.Grieve for all of the people who died at Columbine and quit trying to make out like Rachel was better than everyone else. That would honor her memory better than this exploitive, judgmental and self-righteous book."
5,Touching and Inspirational,"I really enjoyed reading ""Rachel's Tears."" It was written by both of Rachel Scott's parents and has spiritual meaning while still showing that she was ""just"" a girl. It doesn't come across as preachy or fake at all; it shows actual pages from Rachel's diaries and her deep spirituality and love come across in a very real way. Rachel's thoughts and feelings were quite profound, but she expressed them in a very raw and honest manner. I believe that the photo on the cover speaks for itself: while Rachel's inner light is clearly visable, she's wearing jeans and a t-shirt- she's ""just"" an average teen who had some very ""unaverage"" thoughts. The raw emotion expressed by her parents, siblings, and friends is painful to read and yet shows how special Rachel was and continues to be. Rachel was one together young lady and her words are definately worth reading and internalizing."
5,Rachel's Tears,"The book Rachel's Tears is about the Columbine shooting.The author is Beth Nimmo.Its a very good book.I'Ve read other book on the shooting and for some reason this one stood out.In the book it shows that Rachel had a good life and a bunch of friends.It tells what her family went through and her frinds after the sooting.She was a church girl and she loved writing to Jesus in her journal.She would also write poems.I liked reading this book because it was about kids my age.It will make you laugh and cry.You can really thinik you know the girl in the book. I recommend this book because it tells a good story on a sad day with good details. If you are in to true life, then this is a good boog for you."
5,Wonderful book from a very wise young lady!,"This book will bring tears to your eyes more than once. Rachel Scott was very educated, highly spirited and far beyond her time.This book brings into perspective what she saw around Columbine. Rachel knew more than what most teenages know and will learn. Rachel kept her head high and a smiling face and this book shows all of that. The feelings in this book jump out at you when you read every line and emotion. Once you start reading this book you can't put it down because you just can't wait to find out what everyone was thinking. Rachel was truly blessed and she has helped me, as a teenager, with the reason Columbine happened and the aftermath of the whole situation. Columbine shocked and scared a lot of teenagers all of the US this book has truly helped. I highly recommend this book to anyone especially if you are having difficulties understanding why Columbine even came about or how the parents and teenagers felt about the tragedy."
5,An unforgetful book for an unforgetful girl,"As a member of the Columbine community and a student at a near by High School this tragedy had a great impact on me. I read She Said Yes and then I heard of Rachel's Tears. My boyfriend knew Rachel and talks about what a wonderful person she was and I have many friends that knew Cassie as well and through these books I can see what my friends saw in their friends who were taken from us April 20, 1999. Rachel's Tears has helped me to further cope and to get some insight into this tragedy. The journal entries are all so encouraging and she lived a life that shall never be forgotten. Please feel free to e-mail me at WWJD1cor13@juno.com"
4,What a sweet testimony.,"What a sweet and lovely tribute to a daughter who died too soon and certainly in a senseless way. I was a little leery to read this book, as I'm the mother of two teenage daughters. I wasn't sure what type of information or details would be included and I was pleasantly surprised by what it contained. What I found was a book written by two parents trying to make sure people didn't forget about the people involved in the Columbine tragedy, and most importantly, show that there is HOPE and PEACE in Christ! They share stories about their daughter and share stories from her journal. Rachel's faith in Christ was amazingly intimate and not one you'd expect for such someone her age.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it for teens and adults. I would hope that if I was presented with such a tragedy, I would present myself the way this family has."
1,A couple of facts to consider,"Let's consider a couple of facts here. Number one. The account of Rachel's supposed ""martyrdom"" (i.e. the idea that she was shot after admitting to a belief in God) is completely and totally incompatible with original eyewitness testimony of her tragic death, all of which unanimously and unequivically state that there were no words whatsoever exchanged with her killers. Number two. The entire martyrdom story is almost verbatim identical to a story told about another Columbine victim, Cassie Bernell (and later proven false).So does this mean that ""Rachel's Tears"" is a shameless, unmitigated lie? I believe I just answered that."
1,no...,"i sorry, i read this book and it was VERY easy to put down. simple as the fact that because she was a christian and because she died, does NOT make her a martyr. there is nothing that proves she died FOR HER FAITH.i found this book to be rather pathetic in it's attempts to bring every sinlge thing back to god. i rread this book with the intention of learning more about what happened but all i found was more myths. truth seekers aviod this book and find something better"
3,Rachel's Tears,"I was actually watching CNN when the news broke that there had been shots fired at Columbine. Has it really been ten years? With the news media referring to it every time a school shooting occurs, it does not seem that long ago.One of the victims of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's rampage was Rachel Scott. Like most girls, she struggled with issues like smoking, drinking, and sexual purity. But unlike many, Rachel had an amazing faith in God that brought her through it all.The first part of the book recounts how the Columbine tragedy unfolded from the perspective of Rachel's parents. For the remainder of the book, they trade off stories, discussing how much they learned of their daughter's spiritual depth by the journals she left behind.It's a great inspirational read. But was she a martyr? I would say no. Does that discount the depth of her faith and what we can take from it? No."
4,Rachel's Tears,"The world changes forever on April 20, 1999 after the tragedy at Columbine High School. One of the victims, Rachel Scott, died specficailly for her faith in Christ. Now, using excerpts from Rachel's dairy, her parents share how the found meaning in their daughter's act of faith."
3,A World Of Faith,"This is a great book for teens to read! At first I couldn't understand how any parents could write a book about their murdered child. Then I realized they were just trying to explain her faith. If every teen in the U.S. today had this much faith in God, it would be a beautiful world."
4,An Inspiring Read,"As the 10th anniversary of Columbine approached, I decided to read Rachel's Tears (written by her parents Beth Nimmo and Darrell Scott), an incredible book that profiles Rachel Scott, a victim of the Columbine attacks. This story gave me insight on a young girl who had a BIG faith. Her letters, copied from pages of her journal, show a girl who had such a big heart, loved everyone, and desired to follow His will for her life above all else. A great read, this story leaves you wanting to take your faith to the next level and praying for even an ounce of the boldness this young girl possessed."
5,Rachel....Touching lives forever...,"I just finished reading ""RACHEL""S TEARS"" and have been deeply moved by this book. I am a 37 year old mother of two, and this 17 year old girls faith was far above any I have known as yet. If you need something to renew your faith in God, or to inspire you to know the Lord personally READ THIS BOOK. It also gives spiritual insight into the tragedy at Columbine that I would have never considered.There is a message from God in everything that happens on this earth today. People just need to realize it, and start living his way. An excellent source of reading for youth groups and ALL teens."
5,A True Story,I LOVED this book. I recomened to to everyone. it was a touching story and it showed how even a person of such a young age can have such a close relation ship with God. It is one of my fav. books ever and i will always treasure Rachel's beloved story. Her parents did a great job!
5,Queen Rachel!,Queen Rachel rules on earth and in heaven as well. This book is a wonderful reflection of an angel in search of God and his eternal love.I loved this book because it rekindled my faith in God. Rachel reaches out and touches the reader's heart and soul. God bless her and her family!
1,don't even think about it baby,"This version of canned heat did not ""work together"" well live,at least not on this lp.Without Alan Wilson and his gifted musicianship and bumblebee vocals, we find the band boring and unfortunately,completely unable to play a ""full sounding"" arrangement of even something as easy to get the crowd off on as a boogie.Get the boogie house tapes,living the blues,topanga coral or even the king biscuit lp.This one is lame,not a good addition to the canned heat legacy.Though I'm a fan of the bands post Wilson work,it is generally not on par with the pre 71' heat."
3,I guess it's okay-,"This bottle is made of nice thick glass. I had hoped that it would have a large opening at the top allowing items stored to be easily removed. --Something without the constriction associated with the top of ""ball"" jars or pickle jars. Quit the contrary, the neck (not shown) under the lid is bulky and prevents objects inside from being easily dispensed or poured out. The lid has a nice rubber seal but it the bottle is useless for my intended purpose.There are no pictures of the top of the bottle This, nor any other website had any depiction of the top of the jar without cover. Luckily I bought only one (which I thought would be one case of four) instead of several cases that I wanted in the long run. Most other sites with this item made it clear that an order for ""three"" for instance would be three cases of four jars. I thought the price was to good to be true and of course it was."
2,Excellent product except...,I purchased 1 1/2 dozen of these to replace the canisters on my kitchen counter and they do make a statement. I was very disappointed to find that Target carried the same three sizes for half the cost. I am a fan of Target and their quality so the fact that they also carry these jars is a statement to their quality. I gave it 2 stars only for the high Amazon cost.
2,jars,I ordered this thinking it was a 3 piece set. Only one was shipped ....very disappointed! I received only one jar and not 3 like the picture
5,I loved it.,"This is a very good coming of age story of a Chinese kid raised in a Black neighborhood of San Francisco. He As a haole married to a Chinese and a martial artist and as a part time San Franciscan, this book captured me on several levels."
1,Boring,"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read about Chinese boys growing up under challenging circumstances. The only other one I can think of that is equally boring, if not more so, is Colors of the Mountain by Da Chen. Come to think of it, Gus Lee endoresed Da Chen's book on the back jacket."
4,You live the book,"You're really living the book, there's so much detail. I had to read this book for a book report, which was not a good idea. The book was very well thought out. I suggest to take breaks after 5 or so chapters. Sometimes, the author goes into too much detail and repeats many things that you already know about the characters. Overall, the book is touching with courage and a little anxiety, I did feel like crying in certain parts for what he had to go through to prove himself to everyone."
3,Just a little disappointing,"I saw Gus Lee speak at a university and I thought he was fascinating. He was very cultured and he had a lot of insight into the cross-culture and language scene in American cities. However, I was a bit disappointed in his book because it isn't very well-written. He attempts to make light of every situation by being witty and making jokes, but he ends up being annoying. However, the book does redeem itself to a point with some great insight into a family that was uprooted from its native Chinese culture and forced to live in San Francisco. China Boy is worth reading, but only if you don't have much else to read right now."
1,'China Boy' is not worthy of reading,China BoyThis is the worst book I have ever started reading within my recallable memory. All the chinese terms are inaccurate or completely wrong. Some of the characters in the book are downright non-sensical. The writing style is so annoying. Can you actually call it a style? I don't understand how it ever got onto a school reading list. I don't think there is any educational value at all. I would like a refund from my bookstore.
5,Crack this open and enjoy!,"Every song on Radio National's Exit 110 packs a punch! Each guitar riff strikes at gut level and I love it! Jared's voice reaches out and smacks every one of my ex-boyfriends so that I don't have to. And, these guys are as tight live as they are on this CD. I find myself cranking the volume up to drown out my own voice. But, you can't keep from singing along to this one so don't fight it. The best thing about this CD is that the second it ends, I want to hear it again."
1,Surefire Documentation,This book is old (over 10 years) so has no current information. Laws change quickly which invalidates the content. Simplistically written and too basic
4,Registered Nurse,"I recommend this book for nurses who have been out of the hospital setting for awhile, to review documentation skills. I currently work in a school setting. It is good for returning to work part or full time. It helped me out when I returned to work every other weekend in a long term care facility."
3,Ok.,"Honestly, this book was sort of good but kind of depressing. I needed to relate to someone else who had left a professional job and found her choice gratifying. This helped somewhat but not much. The trouble is, I didn't find any better books out there on the same topic."
2,One woman's diatribe,"I bought this book to obtain advice on transitioning from career to staying at home. The first two chapters of this book are a diatribe about how awful day care is for your child. As a woman contemplating leaving the work force, I expected more direction from this book about my feelings. My children are actually well cared for in their day care situation. For me, it is not about the lack of quality of care; it is whether or not I personally want to quit my job. This book is not for someone who has already returned to the work place. It has a few minor points, but honestly, I bought two other books that are not so cut throat about the child care situation. Skip this one and get a different one."
1,L'amour fans...this is a NOVELIZATION OF A MOVIE...let this one go!,"Sure, this is a L'amour novel in the sense that Louis put the pen to paper...but the characters, action, and sequence were by necessity based straight from the movie. The writing seems forced and contrived, due to Louis having to work within the framework of an existing story.If you love L'amour, this book will be a struggle for you. Books that are adapted into movies, are often great. Novelizations based on movies...not so much..."
5,well done,"good writing and story telling; Easy to read chapters for short reading spurts. Descriptive, makes me want to see the movie"
2,Not as good as I had hoped. DOUBLE WHAMMY is much better.,"*DAWG* The chemistry just isn't as good in DAWG as it is in DOUBLE WHAMMY(which also stars Denis Leary and Elizabeth Hurley). In DAWG they're way too opposite with conflicting agendas that they never made that love connection like I kept expecting. It just left a bad taste in my mouth at the end of the movie. I must admit there's a pretty good twist that I didn't see coming. But, looking back, it's kind of obvious. I just wasn't looking for it, I kept thinking they would fall in love or something like that. Sometimes a good twist can save a movie, for me, but it didn't warrant enough bite for me to appreciate the entire movie.Anyway, it's not a horrible movie, it's just not as good as DOUBLE WHAMMY. Perhaps, if I'd seen DAWG first, I may have liked it better. But I doubt it, seeing DOUBLE WHAMMY 2nd would have simply persuaded me back to this original conclusion anyway. I wouldn't recommend it unless you get it at a deep-discounted price."
3,"Not Bad,","Not the best Dennis Leary movie, but not a bad addition. The sensitive role he addresses doesn't suit his humor style."
1,Excrement is too kind,"I have seen plenty of bad movies in my day and even enjoyed some for their camp awfulness. This set a whole new standard - I kept watching the way one watches an accident scene. Stay far away. Inane plot, wooden acting and pathetic dialogue. And not even in the same state as funny."
3,Great looking watch.,"The watch looks great. I have several movado's and really like the mirror face on this one, however like someone else said, the twelve o'clock marker fell out of mine as well and then scratched the mirror face all up. I had to have the entire watch replaced."
4,If it says by Karl Heinz Marquardt then get it for the love of...,"Can the man give you any more of what you want spend your deenahs on? Whether you are historical buff or avid modeler? His drawings are exquisite and copious. He appears thorough-going to me. It'll cost a few bikkies but, give it a burl."
5,Best pouf ever! Durable and comfortable.,"I've tried many different poufs. Some are better than others, but I was never satisfied. Most of them start falling apart after a week or two, and if they don't they are too hard against your skin. This is (dare I say it?), the perfect pouf. The texture is just right - it will exfoliate, yet it feels soft and nice against your skin (or mine, at least). It has an easy-to-find and easy-to-use finger loop. And they last, like forever! (But you shouldn't use one that long, they say.) I am just delighted with these poufs!"
2,Not an elastic handle,"The loop/handle is made from the same mesh that the pouf is made from. It doesn't fit over my spigot nor the temp adjustment. The loop is also almost 2"" wide, so even if you got it over your spigot and/or adjuster, it will get in the way of both. This product just got very cheap. I expected elastic, although I was sad to see that they no longer made of rope. I received neither. Like everything else, the price goes up and quality goes down. The price for printing money...This item was supposed to be better than the 99 cents poufs I was buying from the big box discount stores, when I couldn't get to my bed/bath store. The cheap ones are now made better."
2,Disappointed in the color,"It is very sheer, but I don't like it as well as I like the other colors. Fairly good product though. It does dry on chalky and helps with not creasing on your eye."
3,Return To the Island State.,"In this movie, Elvis plays a laid off airline pilot who returns to his home state of Hawaii (he's the descendant of missionaries) and starts a helicopter transportation business with his best friend. The scenery in the movie isn't as breathtaking as in BLUE HAWAII. Nevertheless, the plot of the movie is much more believable and well written than BLUE HAWAII. However, the improvement in the script is dragged down by Elvis' apparent lack of enthusiasm; during the singing sequences he just goes through the motions with no emotion whatsoever. Yet, there is some excitement in the movie found in an unlikely source: the King is stood up in this film by 10 year old Donna Butterworth who steals practically every scene she is a part. Overall, pretty much, just your average Elvis flick."
3,Paradise Hawaiian Style -,"By reviewing the film Paradise Hawaiian Style , I am definitely giving away my age. To pretend that the film hasn`t aged and that that the plot line isn`t thin would be a lie , however this film , like most of Elvis`s films serves as a platform to showcase Elvis the singer. And that he could. With his warm velvety voice and charm he could win over any female heart , add to that his gyrating pelvis and the ladies was screaming for more. The film might have dated but Elvis is as fresh as the day the film was made. For Elvis and all other movie buffs."
2,Elvis Bored Out of His Skull,"An overweight Elvis Presley musters little enthusiasm for producer Hal Wallis' 1966 rehash of ""Blue Hawaii."" In all fairness, if you were saddled with humiliating numbers such as ""Queenie Wahine's Papaya"" and ""A Dog's Life,"" you would beat a hasty retreat to Graceland and forget the movie existed. With a better song selection and more commitment from Elvis, ""Paradise, Hawaiian Style"" might have been pretty good. The scenery is quite impressive and the cast agreeable. Presley even delivers a memorable ballad, ""This Is My Heaven,"" during the lavish finale. However, the ultimate insult occurs when little Donna Butterworth sings ""Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home"" - a jazz standard Elvis never recorded! It is difficult to forgive Wallis and the Colonel for this artistic betrayal."
1,I live in ohio that movie cannot be played on my dvd player,Movie would not play on my dvd player very disapointing i didnt know that there was a difference in where you lived
3,It was good.,"This was the oddest Elvis movie I have ever watched. The whole movie was like a travel guide to Hawaii. It wasn't about the King. He spent the whole movie promising every girl on the islands that he was going to ""scratch their back.. if they scratched his"" He co-owned a helicopter company that transports people back and forth around the islands. It made me feel like I was at the Tiki-Room in Disneyland. One of my favorite parts was the dog transport. He has 6 dogs that need to get to a dog show. He sings a song about the dogs, it is classic Elvis. It was ok, I think that he had better movies, but it was fun to watch him."
2,"Paradise? Get ""Blue Hawaii"" instead","This is a very feeble remake of ""Blue Hawaii"".In this picture, Elvis' third for 1965, he plays Rick Richards (what a name!) who keeps on getting in trouble by messing around with women (wow..that's never happened in an Elvis picture before!). Anyway, Rick tries to create a helicopter taxi service. Got that? Because that's the movie's main plot!The songs are quite bad in this one. Do we think Elvis enjoyed singing ""Datin'"", ""A Dog's Life"" or ""Queenie Wahine's Papaya""? I doubt it very much.Even Elvis isn't in the top of his form for this picture. He is noticeably a little pudgier than usual, and a lot of the dialogue is quite embarrassing to hear (much like TICKLE ME).The only saving grace to this picture is the beautiful scenery. The best sequence, the final one, is probably the film's finest moment. Not much else to recommend from this excuse for a movie.A definite waste of time."
1,Not The Nadir,"I've always been an Elvis fan, but most of his movies have been pretty hard to take. In the second half of his movies, he looks sullen and angry--unless he's singing.What makes PARADISE HAWAIIAN STYLE stand out?I believe this is the one Elvis movie where the king looks thoroughly bored for the ENTIRE film. In every scene, he looks like he's just seconds from stomping off the set and going back to Memphis to figure out just where his movie career went wrong.In fact, here's a game for you: who looks more bored and disgusted for the entire length of a movie?Elvis in PARADISE or Sean Connery in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.It's not as easy to pick as you think."
4,Better than I thought it would be.,It took a while to inflate but it looked great when finished. It stands on its own and can handle being shoved through door ways and such. It appears bigger than I thought it would.
4,Super fun!,"4 ft is taller than my preschoolers, and they love tackling, dragging, and otherwise rough-housing with this ""monster"". It can be a source of conversation about how large dinosaurs were, how big their teeth were, what they ate, etc. 5 days in and it is beginning to lose air, and given how big it is, this means using the air compressor again. 4' tall, standing up or laying down, plus tail takes up a lot of real estate. Definitely would buy it again."
2,leaks!,"we got this for my daughter for christmas and we filled it several times but the air kept leaking out. kind of a crappy gift. oh, well most things these days are junk and a waste of resources."
4,4 foot TREX,My 2yo son received this from the Easter Bunny. It is several months later and still inflated. He jumps on it and beats it with every toy weapon he can find. He simply loves it. The only challenge is to find a good location for it in the house because it is as big as they say it is. A must have for all preschool dino lovers!
3,It's good but could have been better,"I bought this collection of maps when actually looking for a poster of the whole Middle Earth. The maps have an antique look and feel on them and the whole package is of excellent quality. The detail of the drawings is good but simple, I think it could've been more detailed. You cannot place the maps to show the continuity between them because they are not all based on the same scale. And, its missing a very important map which is that of Mirkwood and the Lonely Mountain. Anyway, I recommend it but only if you don't mind my findings."
2,Audio CD actually sound track,"After buying this, I was disappointed to find that the ""audio CD"" (which I hoped would be the entire book on CD) was actually just a selection of five songs from the musical version. It comes wrapped in cellophane, so after opening it and discovering it was really just music, I was slightly mad. If you read the blue slip of paper around the cover, it says ""accompagne' avec 4 chansons du spectacle musical"". It would have been more helpful if Amazon posted a small description of the contents of the package."
3,LOL!,"This was a good movie. I enjoyed it. It entertained me. It made me laugh. It kept me guessing. I enjoyed the music of Stewart Copland, which is worth an extra star right there."
4,Everyone wants the money!,Murders were not funny. All the people trying to take the money was.Even the dog is funny.I watch all Joe Mantegna 's movies.He is a great actor. Sandra
5,Hysterical if you have a sense of humor,"I don't know what the other two people saw, but if you have a sense of humor and like being entertained this movie is a must! It is a B movie, but so was Best in Show, which this is much better. This is a must buy. For silly fun entertainment watch this movie."
1,"Joe Haschka was right, but I read his review AFTER renting","We DID pick it up at the video rental store because our top choices weren't available, AND because of the cast. Big mistake! Haschka says it all perfectly.Amen, and forget this one.What WERE they thinking of?"
1,Product quality,Purchased two of these seats after remodeling our home. The one in the guest bath is holding up fair. But the one we placed in the master bath has already (less than a year) started ripping around the seam. Tried to repair it but nothing for the glue to hold on to.Could not find these elongated padded seats with chrome hinges anywhere else. Paying out $35 a year for a toliet seat is absurd!!
2,padded toilet seat,"Seat is adequate but not great. Bottom of sean bends when sat upon, and seat hinges allow seat to move slightly from side to side no matter how tight the bolts are secured. For the price, it is a decent buy. It is not as solid a seat as I had hoped."
2,poor product,"I bought this for my parents on the strength of Bemis name, but when the seat arrived it had one inch tear starting from the bottom edge. It showed 1/4"" hardboard frame and foam, around which the vinyl is wrapped. The hardboard's edge looked sharp and not sanded round. This can easily cut into the vinyl. The vinyl also looked to be cheap material, which, overtime, will become brittle. I returned this for refund. I bought another kind from Kohler website at twice the price and I haven't got it yet, but I think the quality and the quality control will be more than worth the price."
1,Worst padded seat ever,"i was excited to find an elongated, padded, without plastic hinges, toilet seat! the excitement was short-lived. i had the seat for about 2 weeks and the seat would wrinkle (like they all have) but the worst part was the tiny little split at the seam that started one day. within 3 days the split is now about 1/4 the way around the seat. very poor purchase."
1,Horrible - seat lid came apart 2 months after purchasing,"Horrible choice - seat lid came apart 2 months after purchasing ... NOT RECOMMENDED! Had to go to target and buy a replacement today. Mayfair 113CP Soft Toilet Seat with Chrome Hinges, Elongated, White Vinyl"
2,Great elongated padded seat....but not for long,"I was excited to find this seat for my dad as the color, shape, hinges, padding and sturdiness were perfect for him. After only two months, the inner seam started to split (like others have reported on here) and now the padding is sticking out. Buyer beware...if you're in the market for a seat to last a few months, great.... but otherwise, stay away and keep shopping. Would be the a great seat and would rate 5 stars if not for the faulty and week vinyl seams. Hope this helps someone."
1,Not worth $1.00!!!,"The only lasting parts of this toilet seat are the hinges and the wooden bases. ALL seams split in less than one month of use! I have never had the lid of a toilet seat split like this one did, it split even before the seat."
3,Chrome hinges corrode and seat splits!,"I ordered this in 2009 mainly for the chrome hardware. I felt the chrome hinges would hold firmer, look better, and last longer. Unfortunately, the latter 2 requirements have not been met. The chrome started to corrode within a year and has now become unsightly with ugly flaking where the hinges attach to the lid after about 2 years of daily use. Aside from the unsightliness, I'm sure the strength of the hinges is also compromised. In addition, the seat started to split on top after about a year and is now through to the foam. Three stars because it is nice looking and comfortable, and I'm not really sure about the expected length of time for a soft seat to last. But at the price, my expectations were higher."
4,Good Purchase,The toilet seat is just as I envisioned it to be and it works well in my house. It is comfortable and fits well into my bathroom.
1,"height of seat is only 1-1/2"",lid is 1-1/2""","this seat is only 1-1/2"" and lid is1-1/2""total 3"" not 3.7"" as ad says!why would anyone buy a toilet seat to sit on lid!!this was purchased for handicap that needs 3-1/2"" added to 17"" toilet for ease of sitting and rising!!there is not a soft seat that I can find that is below 5""!!Product looked good and 2day delivery was great!!"
1,DO NOT BUY FOR DIAPER RASH!!!,"Do not buy if it is for your baby as diaper rash cream!!!!! The formula (and product packaging) has changed as of Feb 2011!!! I am posting this to forewarn all parents. I had been using the ""original"" formula since November 2009 and just went out and ordered 5 more 14oz tubs. Guess what? not only has the packaging changed, but the formula is totally different and WORSE!!!!It is now 30% lanolin (as opposed to 50%) and now contains a chemical called Disodium EDTA which is likely NOT good for your baby. STAY AWAY and don't buy anymore!! I'm so mad, b/c the original formula worked and i was going to use it forever. Warn your friends the formula has changed!! So important!!!"
5,This band will soon be sought by nightclubs around the world,"I happened to see this quintet at Borders of Phoenix, playing on a Sunday Afternoon for free. I am still amazed they are not booked at the best nightclubs around this, and other towns. Probably because Phoenix prefers ""smooth jazz."" This is authentic jazz, with sax solos mirroring Coltrane, piano like Hancock, and guitar with presence and intensity. They are very tight together live, which comes across on the recording. Rights Of Seclusion has balance between intense, heated numbers and relaxed, sparse landscapes. Other CDs in my player right now are Herbie Hancock, The New Standard (1996), and Wayne Shorter, the Soothsayer (1966), but I have been skipping those for the Jeff Morrison band daily for the last two weeks."
4,La Dimension Latina's best with Oscar and Wladimir on lead vocals.,"This 2-CD set contains 20 of Dimension Latina's great hits from the 1970s. Oscar D' Leon and Wladimir Lozano are the lead singers on such major hits as ""Lloraras"", ""Arroz Con Manteca"", ""El Frutero"", ""Dame Tu Querer"", ""El Mala Suerte"" and ""Dolor Cobarde""--all of which firmly established this great Venezuelan band's status as a force to be reckoned with in the Salsa world. Unfortunately, the compilation's producers (amazingly) failed to include even one track with Andy Montanez (who replaced Oscar D'Leon as the band's lead singer when Oscar left to pursue a solo career)--and, as such, I can't give it a 5-star rating. This is still a fine compilation, however, and one well worth getting if you can find it."
4,"original, top to bottom","this book is unlike any photo book i've seen - from the photos within to the surface of the cover, it is a work of art. it's price of $50 and length of only 40 pages make my rating 4 instead of 5 stars, but the work itself is some of the best on the contemporary scene. for those intested in street photography, or color photography in general, this is a major work and a must have."
5,"If you love photography, you'll love this book...","The first thought I had after turning the last page of this beautiful book was ""how can this author be almost unknown to the world?"". Looking at Pinkhassov's photographs is a magical and mystical tour in the soul of Japan; every single picture deserves your attention to discover a subject almost hidden in an atmosphere of timeless beauty. The book itself is a beautiful object, but I think it deserves you discover it by yourself. I really hope we can have a new work of this artist as soon as possible."
2,I am surprised,"The pics are great, but the quality of the book is just crap. Sorry to say, but that's what it is."
3,Amazing photographs; needed better presentation,"Pinkhassov's vision is astonishing; you have to see this just to witness the quality of his eye, which is completely unique.The book itself, though, is pretty badly put together. The prints scream to be presented in gloss, with dramatic blacks and vivid, zingy colours, but the paper used is very soft and matt, which dulls everything. The binding has come loose on my copy as well, so I'm fairly certain from reading the above comments that the books was just badly produced.I'd scoop this up for very little money if I could find a loose, damaged copy in the 'used and new' section. Otherwise, enjoy his photographs on the Magnum website, which gives a wider overview that what you get in the book here."
1,Horrible binding!!,"The pages just fell out of the cover! And this was supposed to be hand printed. The title ""Sightwalk"" on the font cover was smeared. The red ink was all over the words and i had to look hard to tell that it said """"Sightwalk"". VERY DISAPPOINTING. It made me wonder for a moment if this was a fake copy. And I'm still wondering."
1,You've got to be kidding.,"I'm very disappointed in this cd. I expected a better beat to gauge my walking instead it was like listening to a radio with no discernible beat most of the time. There really wasn't any formal warm up or cool down period (or any type of coaching)and as far as re-shaping your body, I'd like to know how...a total waste of money."
1,Power Walk???,"I found this cd very Boring! I thought from the title that it would be fast, I was very disappointed in it. I wouldn't recommend it unles you are a beginning walker. Very misleading."
3,music to walk by,The tempo is not as fast as I had anticipated it would be from reading some of the reviews.
4,Prenatal Yoga with just enough Infant activity,"This DVD has a section near the beginning that is solely for the infant and the rest is mostly for the mom while keeping the baby entertained. The workout is only about 30 minutes, but that is just the right amount of time before my three month old gets tired of being on the floor even if I wish it was a little longer. My four year old also has fun participating. The focus in this DVD is on all the right places. There are lots of ab exercises and back stretches along with a good number of arm strengthening poses. I could do without the positive attitude, you are going to be a good mother speech in the opening meditation. This is a good DVD to get you back into your practice while incorporating your little one."
2,Not enough and too slow,This video was disappointing. I wanted something that engages my baby a little more. My baby doesn't placidly lay there like that one in the video. We need activity! I also wasn't impressed with the yoga she leads and was looking for something a little more challenging. Also the part where she does include baby is just awkward with the baby massage included. It would of been nice to see other moms with babies doing the exercises and other variations of the yoga. If you are more experienced with yoga and looking for a way to include it in your life with baby try a book and then getting creative. This video isn't for you.
1,POOR MATERIALS USED,THE SEAT LOOKED GREAT IN OUR HALF BATH... IN FACT I PURCHASED A SECOND ONE ON 11/2. BUT THIS PRODUCT LASTED LESS THAN 3 MONTHS. THE SEAT SNAPPED IN TWO. OBVIOUSLY THIS SHOULD LAST FOR MANY MONTHS. CAN'T SEE THAT AMAZON IS INTERESTED IN GETTING INVOLVED IN A REPLACEMENT.
3,One of the Best Bad Movies Ever,"Amateurish, but unrelentingly bizarre horror movie about a group of graduate students who travel to the Pacific Northwest in search of the Abominable Snowman, who ends up looking suspiciously like the Shaggy D.A. Terrible in pretty much every respect, but so offbeat and unpredictable you can't take your eyes off it. After the surprising (and totally incoherent) butcher knife/toaster-in-the-bathtub bloodbath in the first fifteen minutes, you're hooked. A must-see for bad movie buffs."
3,Aleratec DVD/CD Shredder,"I like how it is quick and does the job. However, I dislike the size of the basket, and how the size of the shredder forces you to fold paper, and make sure it is small enough to go in through half the size of a normal one. I would not have bought this if I had known that, but it is a decent shredder if you look pass the size of the basket and the top."
1,Absolutely THE Worst! Save your money & your time!,"I only wish that I had read the reviews BEFORE I wasted both money and my time. This got turned off 30 minutes into the movie. The jokes weren't just lame, but crude. No self respecting, thinking adult could possibly stomach such garbage."
4,Funny,"When I rented this one I wasn't really sure if it would good or not. Adam Sandler's movies are either extremely funny or pathetically lame and boring. Nicholson has become a great comedic actor over the last 10-15 years, so I took a chance, and I'm very happy that I did. Sandler's portrayal of the pathetic loser was outstanding. From being bullied as a child, to becoming the whipping boy for his boss, he just is quiet and nice to everyone that treats him badly. Enter Jack Nicholson as an ""Anger Management"" guru. In most cases Sandler is playing the straight man to Nicholson, as Jack torments him to the point of explosion, which is where the adventure really starts. Sandler is led to confront the people who have wronged him in the past, with amazing results. The supporting cast is excellent, and you never know what's coming next. A twist ending wraps up the loose ends, and ties the story up perfectly. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
4,Nicholson and Sandler are a good pair.,I thought this movie was funny but I forgot all about it until I saw it again and now it's even funnier than I remember it. I think Sandler and Nicholson make a good pair.
1,badly executed fluff,"What a disappointment. Standard studio tripe - put two big names together but don't put any thought into a script. The concept sounds good on paper, but the movie makes little or no sense and Sandler plays straight man to Jack's overacting. Awful."
3,Cute!!,"Just returned from this movie. It was funny. You'll never think of the song ""I feel pretty"" in the same way again!!! Nickleson was brillant!!"
1,I can't believe some of these reviews!!,This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in years. There is nothing good about this movie! The story is bad and the acting is even worse. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this dreadful film. I could barely stay in the theatre.
1,Total waste of time,I rented this DVD for .99 cent. I got ripped off!!!! I had a hard time watching the whole thing. I will never watch another Adam Sandler movie. I hope Jack Nicholson can do something better in the future but I'm going to be cautious before seeing anything with him in it too. The only bright spot in this movie is Marisa Tomei but her scenes are brief. This one doesn't deserve 1 star.
1,A Horrible Trainwreck,"This movie left me laughing hysterically.....at myself for sitting through the entire thing. What? What? I... ARRRRRGGGHHHH!!! I can't explain to you how unorganized, confusing, and terribly unfunny this piece of garbage was. If you love the Adam Sandler genre of humorless movies, you'll love this gem."
1,BY FAR THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE,"This movie truly is the worst I've ever seen. There is absolutely no plot what so ever, the jokes, when there are any, are terrible, and Jack Niclaus does nothing but piss you off and make you mad throughout the course of this terrible film. I highly reccomend not watching this movie, it is a waste of two actors talents, and the director needs to start looking for a new job. BY FAR THE WORST MOVIE EVER CREATED!"
1,Painful to watch Jack in this type of film,"In a word.. Awful. This was the worst movie of 2003, even worse than About Schmidt. Painfully slow coupled with juvenile one-linersI usually love Nicholson movies, but this is the pits.It was Adam Sandler in the Wedding Singer, without the wooly hair0 stars from me, but I had to enter 1 star..zero was not available"
5,anger management,thank you for the move .I got it on time was very pleased with it.i watch it daily after work. Thanks so much keep up the good work
2,Sandler and Nicholson . . . sadly doesn't work here . . .,"Normally, I would enjoy myself watching films that star Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson. Anger Management left me disappointed. I expected some first-rate comedy from these two, but the verbal humor didn't work that much on me. Though, Woody Harrelson did make me laugh in one of his most unusual roles. Aside from that, this movie didn't have me in hysterics that much. Oh well. I'll still have The Waterboy and Mr. Deeds to watch."
5,Another Awesome Film!!!,"This is a really good Adam Sandler classic! Everybody does an awesome job, and the plot was very interesting! Sandler plays Dave Buznik who gets on a plane, and has to sit next to Dr. Buddy Rydell. Buddy happens to be an Anger Management Therapist. When Dave is wrongfully accused of being assaulting a flight attendent on the plane, he has to see Buddy for help. Buddy moves into Dave's apartment, forces him to confront his childhood bully, makes him ask out smokin' hot Heather Graham, even though Dave already has a girlfriend, makes him break up with his girlfriend so he can date her, and much more! I highly recommend you get some ANGER MANAGEMENT!!!"
3,Really Corny Ending hurts an otherwise fairly good movie,"The movie starts with a good premise: Nicholson as a wacky psychiatrist trying to ""cure"" mild mannered Sandler of his anger issues. Nicholson is perfect as the goofy shrink while Sandler is better than usual(okay that's not saying much, I realize).Marissa Tomei is an Oscar winning actress but you'd never know it here as she is underused in a part where she doesn't get too much to say or do. The first 2/3 of the movie is fine with some funny scenes and a decent plot.Then the screenwriters go for every corny cliche they can find to end the movie with. Maybe they had real writers do the first 80 minutes or so then they give it to a 5th grader to finish it. The ending is just brutal and it brings down the rating considerably on an otherwise decent movie. I see where 220 people have reviewed this so far on Amazon and 3 stars is the average. It could have been a lot more with better writing."
1,Painful to watch,"I had some expectation before I saw this movie that I would see a pleasantly humorous story. Considering Adam Sandler's history, my expectations were not high but at least I had hoped for a pleasant diversion. Was I wrong! From the start this movie was painful to watch. This was as humorous and pleasant to watch as surgery on puppies without anesthesia. It may not have been as bad as ""Ishtar"" but I found it much more difficult to watch. My wife walked out of ""Anger Mangagement"" after only 10 minutes. She was ""angry"" enough to demand her money back.The situations were highly contrived, totally improbable and sophomoric. The world displayed in this movie was straight out of Dante's ""Nineth Level of Hell"". And, this was supposed to pass for humor. The acting was passable however in a vehicle like this no one walks away unscathed. Shame on Nicholson for getting involved in this turkey. Must have been the money.In the viewer's case, save YOUR money."
2,Not as funny as expected,"The formula sounds fool-proof. Adam Sandler plays a designer of clothes for overweight cats who, through a series of unfortunate incidents, is sentenced to go through an anger management program with therapist Jack Nicholson. Although it seems that the comic possibilities are endless, somehow the laughs fail to come. There are a few funny moments, but they are surrounded with over-the-top, unfunny antics by the pushy Nicholson and unbelievable naivete by Sandler. There are several cameo appearances which are humorous and very appropriate for a film on anger management, but watch carefully because some of them are very brief. This is a concept loaded with potential which somehow falls flat from poor writing. The actors try hard, but are not given much to work with."
1,Absolutely the WORST movie ever,"I used to mention ""The Devil and Mac Devlin"" as an example of the worst movie ever, a complete waste of time, good actors in a bad movie with poor direction and bad dialogue and lame sets and tired everything. But this one tops it (or bottoms it). Ladies and gentlemen, the NEW lamest excuse for a movie ever: Anger Management.If you saw the ads, you've seen the movie - I hesitate to say ""the best parts"", since even those were weak, but the key plot points, anyway. Adam Sandler plays a gentle guy who doesnt get angry until driven there by angry people, forced into anger management with a borderline pycho, and then periodically made angry. But it's the same scene (and idea) over and over and over and over and over again.It's like a really bad Saturday Night Live skit that never should have happened, and didn't know when to stop. I'm guessing it actually began as an idea of SNL and it should have stayed there - as a discard idea.Yuck, yuck, yuck."
4,Liked the better the 2nd and 3rd time I watched it.,"I have to admit that my expectations were high for this movie and I was initially disappointed. The plot was unrealistic and the ending far-fetched. Since I had bought it, I watched it again and found that it was one of those movies that needs to be watched more than once because the enertainment is in the one liners and very funny scenes. Watch it again. It is hilarious. -gooosfraba"
3,"""I feel pretty...""","Anger Management was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, Marisa Tomei, and Luis Guzman among others.The movie brings to the screen the story of Dave Buznik whom the court sentences to compulsory anger management sessions following an incident on a plane.The acting and the setting are above average, though the supporting actors are not that great (with the exception of the two girls that play the porn stars, WOW!) while their characters were overly exaggerated to the point that they got tiring AND annoying very early on.As for the plot, the humor and the dialogues, they are nothing special.Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really... No masterpiece here.If Adam Sandler is what you had in mind, check out the wonderful comedies: Happy Gilmore, the Wedding Singer and/or 50 First Dates."
3,Pretty Funny!,I am not the worlds biggest Adam Sandler fan. This movie was pretty darn funny.Also... Heather Graham is reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally pretty.
4,Adam's Best!,"Of all the Adam Sandler movies I've seen, this is my favorite. (I'll admit that ""Little Nicky"" was a close second.) There are lots of great gags throughout the movie and as long as you keep in mind that the plot is just there to string the gags together you'll find that this movie is quite enjoyable! I'm sure that in the writing process the gags sprang from the plot, but the plot is definately not the strength of this movie. There are many ridiculous twists in the story that in retrospect are just plain stupid, but there's so much funny stuff going on that you hardly notice. If you're looking for something funny, this movie delivers."
3,"Stupid movie, but made me laugh","This movie had some parts that were pretty funny...but the plot was just stupid, and very predictable. Adam Sandler doesnt act as tough as he does in his other movies (going around beating everyone up) which is a good thing, but overall I would just watch this movie once and forget about it. It is a step up from Mr Deeds though, which is why it gets 3 stars instead of 2."
3,This was an Okay movie,This movie might have been ruined by Nicholson even thought hisacting was good it might of ruined Sandlers great roll where he was a 100% normal guy and Nicholson might have messed it up.Story 5 Story 10 Direction 7 Action 7 Entertainent 7Overall=36/50 wich is 72% But go down to 3 stars this is OKThe Best part of the movie maybe the 2 Porn Star girls.Good plan for Nicholson to be messed up wasn't as good as DeNiro
2,Anger Management,"Adam Sandler and Jack Nicolson are funny in Anger Management, but lame and over-played jokes don't help this movie stay on its feet. With overplayed lesbian jokes and a bad disposition, Anger Management isn't exactly another shining Sandler movie. Skip it."
4,"Repeat after me - ""Goos-fra-ba...""","This movie was hilarious - I can't believe all the people that ranked on it! If you read a lot of the reviews here you'll see that everyone who panned it said it didn't meet their ""expectations."" That's the problem - I think, everyone expects a Nicholson film to be an award winner. If you're a Sandler fan, you'll enjoy this a lot although Nicolson is the funny one here as an eccentric, Jazzy-Beatnik doctor who flips over the line drawn between genius and maniac constantly. Its really fun to see Nicolson be this silly - ""Did you hear a frog, Buddy?""There's also some great cameos and supporting actors. (Bobby Knight, MacEnroe, Heather Graham, Rudy Guiliani, John C. Reilly, Luiz Guzman, Woody Harrelson) but John Tuturro is the best as Sandler's highly-excitable, over-the-top ""Anger Buddy.""Don't expect a blockbuster comedy - coz that it ain't, but I wouldn't be suprised in time if this movie gets a cult-classic following."
4,A pleasant and fun comedy,"This was a very good movie in our opinion. We enjoyed the brilliant acting as well as the plot of the movie. Having the personal experience of what it's like to hear someone tell you to relax while you are completely calm helps to connect with Adam Sandler in his role. The aggrevation that he goes through and the annoyance of everything that happens related to that anger. Jack Nickolson is as amazing as ever.I definitely recommend seeing this movie. Beware of the ""I feel pretty"" song. It gets stuck in your head for weeks and there is no way of getting rid of it"
2,Mr Deeds can't match Nicholson's performance,"Nicholson is great, but it's too bad the rest of the movie can't live up to his talent. In a role tailored to his quirky character, Nicholson is brilliant, but Sandler's dull character and attempts at acting are no match. Sandler should never have taken the role opposite of Nicholson because it underscores he is no more than a wise crack with potty humor, not a serious actor with any depth. With a little better editing, I think anyone other than Sandler would have made this movie enjoyable. The pace was just enough to keep me from looking at my watch, wondering when it was over."
1,Worst Ever? It's not even that good!!!!!!!,"What on earth does it say about shallow modern minds that people actually gave this a five-star rating?????? Unfathomable!!!Appalling drivel, all the more annoying in that I watched it on an evening when I was in need of a laugh or two.Script utterly devoid of anything remotely memorable, from structure to wit/humour....I agree completely with the person who wrote that you had to suspend disbelief over the nature of the story line to such an extent that the elastic snapped.To think that the box above insists I have to give this even one star. To think that people got paid for making this!!!DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,there is no god,"Note: In all fairness, movie preferences are subjective. If you like Adam Sandler's movies (any that have been released AFTER ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Billy Madison"", in other words any Adam Sandler movie from 1998 or later), then you might like this movie. I cannot judge your opinion. With that caveat, here is my review:----------Like taking a cheese grater to your nether-regions, this movie is unthinkably painful to watch.If you're foolish enough to disregard my warning and you actually see the movie, know that you will need therapy afterwards...you might even need ANGER MANAGEMENT."
1,BORING!!!,"This would have to be one of the worst movies that I saw last year!(the other being Matrixs Revelutions)It's portrayed as being funny when really it's anything but!It's too try hard where funny lines are ruined by bad acting and vice versa.I had to suffer through 2 hours or so or boringest were I nearly went to sleep,except the loudness of the movie wouldnt let me!This movie is like Cold Mountain.Way to much hype over a stupid and boring film."
1,PAINFULLY UNFUNNY,"The poster sold the project: Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler nose to nose. ANGER MANAGEMENT (Columbia Tristar) is a series of stupid sophomoric skits. Even worse, instead of Sandler's well-honed crazed persona, he's normal here. A stupid film that could've been really funny if played as an angry guy meeting a REALLY ANGRY GUY."
1,I DIDN'T LAUGH AT ALL,"I judge as a good comedy, a movie that makes me laugh. I didn't laugh at all. It's simply not believable.I will not criticize the actors.They are okay. The story is just flat with jokes that you expect longtime before they happen on screen. The worst moment is the scene in the stadium...completely bull.... I was bored and this therapy didn't work on me. It's completely the comedy genre you expect for Nicholson. On the other hand, it's too clean to fit Adam Sandler unfortunately."
2,"sandler and nicholson, who came up with this","I really didnt think this movie who'd do good in the theaters and it didnt and I thought that it was a waste of my money going to see Nicholson and Sandler sing west side story songs and Nicholson getting naked, im sorry. The funniest part who'd have to be Sandler getting yelled at everyone on the airplane and they stungun him. but, to my knoledge it was really boring after awhile. check out Sandler in his best performance in Punch Drunk Love, that was better than this. Tuturro has some funny moments also"
4,Actually not a bad movie,"This movie suffered from overhype, with a million commercials on everyday before the movie's release. While funny, the commercials made me think I had seen all the movie had to offer.While this movie does star Jack Nicholson, this is definitely an Adam Sandler movie. It has the same co-stars as some of his other movies (John Turturro, Luis Gonzolez, and a couple of others) and has the same type of humor. But this is a good movie because Sandler plays a normal person. The funny characters are the supporting cast.This movie is a lot better than Deeds or Big Daddy, but not as good as the breakthrough hit, Happy Gilmore."
1,Abismal,"Thank God I was smart enough to turn it off after 45 minutes. Thats over an hour of my life saved for sleeping. I did get screwed out of the $3, though. Give $3 to a homeless person, or burn it to keep warm before you rent this, and you'll be glad you did."
3,"Awesome movie, except for one thing...","ANGER MANAGEMENT had too many vulgar and obscene jokes. Sandler and Nicholson were both great in their roles, the story was clever, it was a very funny and enjoyable movie except for the crude sex jokes. Other than that, it was very good. It's just too bad a good movie had to be ruined unnecessarily."
2,"Hilarious idea, poor turn-out","Anger Management (2003) Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, Marisa Tomei, Luis Guzman, Lynne Thigpen, John Turturro, Nancy Walls, D: Peter Segal. Redefines the phrase ""odd couple"": Sandler as an even-tempered businessman (who never sticks up for himself) is wrongly sentenced to an anger management session and Nicholson is his eccentric instructor who turns out to be more aggressive than him. One-joke screwball comedy had a good premise, not as funny as the critics quote it to be, better yet Sandler is less obnoxious than his actual persona inquires. Here, Nicholson is a real galling devil, and genuine comedy would come out of watching him convey his anger at a Laker's game. Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani give cameos. Running Time: 106 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude sexual content and language."
2,Supposed to be funny?,"Like so many other reviewers, I picked up this movie because of its star power. It does not seem like you could go wrong with Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson. Looks like I was wrong though...Sandler's character does not have any anger issues, and it is frustrating to see his character go through so many runs of bad luck, and get blamed for things that are not his fault. All of the incidents rely on personal injuries and extreme immaturity, and I guess this is what the writers thought would make a good comedy. Unfortunately for them, it did not get too many laughs from our audience.If you can hold on for the last twenty minutes, things do clear up a little, and seem to be a little more sane. (The trick is just sitting through the first 75 minutes of the movie!) However it is not clear how Sandler comes out as a better person for all the time he spent in his sessions with Buddy (Nicholson). I was really hopeing for more of a comedy..."
1,SWEET FANCY MOSES!!,"Boy! Did this movie suck donkey balls!! I was left terribly disappointed and furious! Nothing about this movie was pleasant. Nor did the ""plot"" make much sense for those of us who sat through this junk just because we wanted our money's worth. Please stay away and let's give a little prayer for Sandler and Jack so they may be forgiven by the masses and make a winner together some day..:) Thank you kindly!"
2,just there,I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler&Find Him Vastly Overrated&this film didn't change my stance on that.as for Jack Nicholson He should stay Court-side at Laker Games.He is just getting by with suspect film after suspect film.I haven't felt one of His films in Many Moons.this film was just something to watch&didn't move me at all.
1,No Laughs,"There wasn't a single laugh in this wretched excuse of a comedy. Crude, yes. Dumb, certainly. But no laughs. Even though the movie is only 106 minutes long, it seemed endless. Adam Sandler used to be funny but this is three turkeys in a row for him (four if you count the painful Eight Crazy Nights cartoon). Jack Nicholson tried his best but with material like this, he didn't have a chance."
1,At Least Sandler Is Consistant,"I only rented it because I thought Nicholson could offset the unwatchable Sandler. No such luck. Sandler is by far the most consistantly bad Hollywood hackctor in history and this mess is no exception. This is two hours you will never recover, choose wisely."
1,blahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"in a phrase..............STINK, STANK, STUNK,i love adam sandler and i love jack even more, that made this atrocity all the less palateable!i will continue to eagerly watch for any and all films with either or both of theses stars in them but i will not waste my time viewing this particular hunk of blah again.senseless misguided drivel is the only phrase that accurately describes this film."
1,Thumbs Down!,"I had big expectations for a movie that included two good actors: Adam Sandler & Jack Nicholson, but this movie was a big let down. The movie got funny until after 20 minutes and they showed some pretty stupid stuff (And I like stupid stuff!): lesbians stapling one of their mouth closed, the guy from cheers acting as a cross-dresser!, hurting a budhist and making fun of his retarded sister!, telling a woman that he is expolding in his pants and she says thats ""too cute!"", how much lame crap can you stuff into a movie!Don't bother watching this unless you want to see a sick movie and you are over the age of twelve."
2,Not really funny,The story is just ok until the plot twist is revealed which is the most contrived and unbelievable. It is almost as if the final plot surprise was written after the movie was screened.The con-game surprise ending really wipes out an already poor excuse for comedy.
2,The script made me furious,"This film got off to a very promising start. Many of the elements were surreal but well-founded in pop psychology. The acting was quite good and Nicholson played Nicholson as he does in all his films, but quite good nevertheless. It started off quirky and offbeat and I did like the episode on the Airplane.It paced well, this was helped by Nicholson and Sandler. Then something went incredibly wrong...the film found its way into a packed baseball stadium (I am sure that most of the major Hollywood studios employ these guys to sabotage scripts and movies in order to make the movie more 'accessible' to the movie going public), it did not need this treatment as it turned a perfectly good film into a major turkey! and what the hell was Mayor Giulliani doing in this film anyway?.I felt quite angered by the end. I think I shall write an angry letter to the studio to demand my money back."
3,Some funny parts but...,"A pretty good flick but I still give it 3 stars out of 5. It gets 4 stars because I laughed pretty good and it has Nicholson in it. Yes, it is set in New York but I have to detract one star for the unfortunate and disgusting prominence of the New York Yankees. Other than that I really liked this movie and would watch it again, only turn my head when the Pinstripes are being shown. Go Red Sox!"
5,Did we see the same movie??,"I watched Anger managment and even though i like Adam sandlers and jack nicholsons movies, Im not a crazy dedicated fan.However, I loved this movie! I felt his roll that he played in Anger Manangment may have been a slight varietion of his normal shtick. However it was non the less entertaining. His frustration and precariouse situations made watching the movie very entertaining and yearning to know what was going to happen next. The cat scenes may have been a little cheesey however being an animal lover ( and owner of a fat cat) i thought it was cute. The ending to this movie couldnt have been better. It was a perfect mated ending of the rolls played by the charachters."
2,"started out awesome, disappointing ending","Most of this movie is funny. There's many good parts in here, and Sandler/Nicholson make a great comedic duo in here. However, like so many other people who had started out enjoying this, I was extremely disappointed at the ending. I could not help but feel gypped. A hilarious movie boils down to this??? If you haven't seen the movie, be forewarned that the ending is cliched and bad, which is a shame because the movie had the opportunity to end on a high note."
1,Anger management fails...,"I watched Anger Management on the plane. Since there is nothing else to watch, and the flight is more than ten hours, you usually watch whatever is on T.V. I thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad, though there are some funny parts. There is some offensive language. Overall, it's a bad movie and is not worth watching."
2,I cannot believe this movie was NOT funny!,"Purchased this DVD and thought ""How could I go wrong?"" with great actors (and the plot sounded funny) and it had potential, but it just wasn't funny. Long time to sit through a comedy and wait for the laughs to come. Save your money, you may want to rent it if you feel like throwing away a few bucks for a couple of funny scenes. What a waste of talent! And it'll be a waste of your time."
2,What happend Adam?,I only saw this movie for one reason...Adam Sandler... I loved his older movies such as Billey Madison and Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy was good also Mr. Deeds was ok .. maybe 3.5/5 but this movie was a dissapointment. although there were the occasional laugh out loud scenes it was a pretty boring movie and when you go to see an AS movie you expect it to be funny. :(
4,A great comedy,"This was a great movie. It's Nicholson at his best, second only to ""as good as it gets"". Lots of comedy and great fun. This is a good date movie or just good to watch for no reason at all. It will lift you're spirits and keep you coming back for more."
2,Terrible,"Wow.. was this ever a crappy movie. I was really surprised that Adam Sandler & Jack Nicholson could be in such a terrible movie. Now, the movie did have a lot of funny parts but it just wasn't good. The movie is based around Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) who mistakenly gets in trouble on an airplane. He is ordered by a judge to attend anger management sessions run by Doctor Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson). After another accidental mishap, the judge orders Dave to step up his therapy or spend one year in jail. Opting for more therapy, Buddy moves in with Dave to help him with his problem and all hell breaks loose."
5,Hilarious!,"Sandler and Nicholson are quite a hilarious duo in this comedy! This movie is definitely for the adult, there is some bad language and vulgar scenes. But what movie doesn't have that anymore? I laughed myself silly! This is one the best movies I have seen lately! I highly reccommend it for anyone with a funny bone."
2,Funny Parts--Lame Overall,"I adore Jack Nicholson, and that's why I went to see this movie. I doubt I'd given it a second thought had he not been in it, because I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan. (Sandler was surprisingly not obnoxious, as he tends to be.)I laughed quite a few times. There definitely were entertaining parts of the movie. However, the storyline was incredibly stupid. I wanted to like it so much, but I walked out of the cinema thinking ""What is Jack Nicholson doing in a lame movie like that?!"""
1,Anger Management needs Sex Management,This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever watched. I should've known better then to watch it because I don't like stupid comedy which means that I don't generally watch Adam Sandler movies but this looked good in the trailers. Too much dumb sexual humor. I don't recommend anybody watch this unless you really love Adam Sandler & dumb sex humor. Waste of my time.
3,BUY THE ORIGINAL SERIES - HIGHER QUALITY PICTURE,"This DVD looks more like VHS quality than the original DVD released by the producer. So you get what you pay for... but for a few more bucks, buy the original version here on Amazon.com (same name) and get a better picture and a box cover that will match your collection."
5,Loved as an kid and will never forget this book!,"I read this book many times as a child. This book really does get across the message that you should be happy with who you are and be true to yourself. As I became a teacher, I have gone back to this book over and over again to illustrate that same message to the next generations! Love this book!!!"
4,Being happy with yourself,"This is a wonderful children's book about learning to be happy about the way you look and not trying to look like others. Donkey-Donkey tried holding his ears in different ways so that he could look like other farm animals, each time with very bad results. Of course all the other animals told him that the way he held his ears was all wrong and that he should try to look like them,-- the best way to look. Finally he realizes the only person to look like was himself and he is happy again."
4,Good songwriting,"CD ReviewPolly Paulusma - Scissors In My PocketPolly Paulusma is an exceptional songwriter.Her debut CD Scissors In My Pocket highlights her distinctive voice and beautiful melodies.Polly's songs are not your typical English folk music, there's nothing traditional here but the songs have a feel that can easily fall into that category.Mainly an acoustic album this is the type of CD that can be enjoyed on a cold Sunday afternoon at home.It contains a wealth of great songs that are rewarding and new things are heard upon each listen.Polly has gone a long way very fast, from South London she was playing folk festivals in Europe until discovered by Indie label One Little Indian.She recently did a support for the recent Bob Dylan tour of Europe.Scissors In My Pocket has had great reviews in her native country describing her music as ""Intelligent and thoughtful"".This is a seriously well-produced CD that captures your imagination and thoughts."
