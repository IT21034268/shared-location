4,Give A Girl A Break,"This is a great dancing musical.My only complaint to Warner Brothers, is that it would have benefited from a better digital transfer.The colours are muddy, and there are a few blemishes that were inherent on the Technicolor positive."
5,"Koln, B & L, and Facing You","Koln is Jarrett's best known solo piano album. But between Koln and Bremen/Lausanne, the latter is musically the better album. But, my all-time favorite is Facing You, Jarrett's first solo piano album. I own all three in their original vinyl, but I own only Facing You in CD. It is THAT good. Facing You is the kind of music that grows on you. It doesn't pretend to be anything but honest, simple music. Listen with your heart and you will understand what I mean."
5,"Keith Jarret, Bremen & Lausabbe","One of Keith's solo works, a musthave for them who loves the way he improvisate. Bought this work years ago on vinyl and still like the 'hums' of Keith which drove him to far heights.Not the easiest music to listen to, sometimes boring, but then suddenly wake up with sweet melodies and realise that it was part of the game"
5,Hypnotic and Brilliant,"Koln Concerts seems to get the plaudits from the general public (born out by the number of reviews it has received on the Amazon site compared to this one). I've been listening to both records for over 20 years and Solo Concerts is far superior.Unlike KC, which drones on for long periods, this record is constantly shifting, constantly interesting.One of my Desert Island Disks."
5,Lyrical and Moving,"Toni Buzzeo takes us on a magical trip back through time to the days when the vigilance and skill of the lighthouse keeper were the only things between a storm tossed ship and catastrophe. But then, there were some storms so fearsome that even the lights were of no help. Auntie Maita's reminiscences of her solitary childhhod on fictional Sanctuary Island are lyrical and moving. She tells the story of one storm and the sea chest that washed up on shore in its aftermath. The connection between the contents of the chest and the event that awaits Auntie Maita and her grand niece eighty years later is one that will leave you in tears as you gently close the cover of the book."
5,Moving and gorgeous,"This story made me cry, I was so moved. And the pictures are incredible ... I never get tired of looking at them. I've given copies to three friends so far and they report enthralled children. Wonderful!"
5,Jenny F,"This story is beautiful, as are the amazing illustrations. I have a copy of this book at my beach condo and it inspires me to look for seaborne treasures every time I read it."
1,This book sucks.,"I read this review on a recommendation that it was like the 13th Warrior movie and it was! They both are terrible. You think just because you put some favorite group of heroes in a book, that it's automatically well done? Awful. Avoid this waste of paper and ink."
3,Wolves,"No relation but I'm a bit of a space Wolves fan. The Space Marines are meant to be hard fanatical worriers who's training and life style has desensitized them to basic human notions. I liked the supper human world of sub human emotion. King caught this well in a book I feel out stepped the first Space Wolves.This book is a must to anyone interested on the 40k universe.Ragnar shows a mavric chapter unlike that of Ultra Marine, This book gives atmosphere and insight but would be aimed more for people interested in Warhammer 40k them general public. Not to be judged in 50 pages."
3,They're Just Drip Pans,"What can anyone write about these? They're aluminum drip pans. They catch grease. Unless you can buy them via some sort of Free Shipping deal, you'd be much better off buying them at the local hardware store. I bought mine with my grill, so shipping costs weren't a problem. They work fine."
5,"They fit, and they work.","They do what they're supposed to do, and it's a great filler item to get to the $25 for free shipping. I have also used it for smoking chips on the grill (to put some hickory or mesquite chips that have been soaked, lift the grate, and let the grill to the work).The way I figure this set will last at least two years."
2,Why ??,"I used these drip pans when my grill was new since a couple of them came with my Baby-Q. Since then, I line the pan with heavy duty aluminum foil. Works just as well as the pans at a much lower cost."
5,Small drip pan purchase,"Don't pay shipping. Go to Home Depot and pay $1 more, but no shipping and you walk away with them"
4,early dr. john at his best.,"Dr.Johns remedies is a great example of his earlier recordings.Very late sixties seventies influences can be heard here.The musicians are top notch.The sound quality on this particular re issue is excellent!While there are only six songs on this cd please be aware that tracks 5 and 6 have a running time of more than 27 minutes.Track 6 titled anglo anthem is my personal favorite.At over 17 minutes long it provides for a non stop musical journey.Various tempo changes,lots of percussion sounds and effects,interesting vocal arrangements,and last but not least great bass and drum playing.For guitar players not much going on here.Other favorites are what goes around comes around and Mardi Gras Day at over 8 minutes long.All songs written by dr.john.ENJOY!"
2,Not enough for the price,"I thought the book was well written and would be marginally useful as a basic reference book but I expected more content such at the WIN32 API and more than just a preview of WIN64 and a summary discussion of COM/DCOM and other more complex subjects.The appendix comparing Win32, Unix and the ""C"" Library, while making good book fodder, is relatively useless without substantive definitions and examples.All in all, not much bang for the book. I would not have purchased the book if I had reviewed a copy of the book before ordering it through Amazon."
5,A Good Practical Win32 Programming Book,The first edition of this book was a very good practical Win32 programming books. There are numerous well documented examples of a wide variety of programming tasks. The edition of the sockets programming chapter is a plus in the new edition. This is the book that I recommend to anyone wanting to learn Win32 programming.
3,a real reference book would be better,"1. While this book is not a real reference book since it is not complete at all, many pages are wasted by listing system calls with parameters. I expected more overall description of the system.2. It is only intereting if you want to compare UNIX with WIN32. On the other hand, the difference between Windows and UNIX are far beyond the ""dry"" kernel discussed in this book. Unless you are learning OS fundamentals, which is not the case for any one familiar with UNIX, it is not a exciting reading without OLE and Windows. My point is that neither UNIX expert nor Windows enthusiast would find this book worthwhile their time.3. I'm still reading it. It is not useless. But it failed my expection built on all other reviews and the classical looking."
4,Best action,Loved the TV series - wouldn't mind getting all of them on disk.This is better than nothing.
3,JERRY'S MACHINE NEEDS A LITTLE OIL,"This was one of Jerry Bruckheimer, the movies' premier action scions, first t.v. ventures. A pilot for a failed series, SOLDIER OF FORTUNE INC. tries to use slow motion action sequences to further its plot. While not a bad movie, it is derivative and offers little new for the genre.Brad Johnson (Always) stars as the leader of a special ops group who is critically wounded in a botched Mexican raid. The opening sequences are confusing, and redundant, done from each character's prospective fate. The misleading technique doesn't do much but confuse the viewer as to what's really going on. Johnson uses his macho presence to good effect and gets able support from Real Andrews and Tim Abell. David Selby (Dark Shadows, Falcon Crest) is even on hand as the by the books commander.Entertaining but not stimulating. One can see why the pilot didn't sell and why Bruckheimer and company didn't do too much t.v. work afterwards."
3,Basic investment guide for those who believe in the Random Walk theory,Very basic advice for those who believe in random walk theory. Unfortunatley not of much use to anyone over and above a novice.
3,not much new idea,"i spent $10 on this book and finished reading it in half an hour. To my disappointment I did not find anything special about it. Most of the ideas he talks about are fairly common for investors, such as investing earlier than later, keeping a constant flow of investment, balancing risk and return, etc. I think these are common sense to most investors. The only thing special about this book is the discussion on efficient market theory. The author is a strong believer of this theory and spends three chapters on it. The takeaway is to invest only in index funds. That's all I got from this book.I think for a person with no investment knowledge at all, this is a fun book easy to read. But not that useful for more experienced readers."
4,"Might not be his best, but certainly not a bad one","I saw this on HBO earlier. After that I was trying to find whether there is an audio book or other format of sound recording, so I can listen to it in my car. DVD doesn't quite work for this purpose.For the content, I think it was fairly good. I like the way he put up those musical style songs. While not necessarily every single sentence in the lyrics is funny, I do see the difficulties of such a work. Also, the concluding segment was quite impressive in my opinion, which triggered my intention of getting a soundtrack.I was a little surprised to see the negative reviews. Stand up comedies are hard, and there are parts of shows I found it less than funny even for my favorite comedians, and from one of my favorite shows. I found this one better than fair enough already."
3,Not His Best Stuff,"This is not Mr. Kleins best HBO special but so what,its ROBERT KLEIN,come on give the guy a break, you try & do what he does at 69. Every time he's at L.I. comedy clubs which is usually twice a year,I'll go & watch him perform,his act never gets stale.After each show he signs autographs for free & will talk to you at great lengths time permitting.One of the greatest comedians alive today,the man,the leg,Robert Klein."
4,very cute,"I was so happy to find an airplane theme. At first I was not sure about the colors, but I really like it now. I just wish it had more matching accessories."
4,"Nice colors, great theme for a little boy.","So happy with this bedding set. My older son has a train theme in his room with tracks on the wall, painted RR signs, etc in primary colors ( and it is definitely a room to grow in). When I saw this airplane set, I knew I found the perfect bedding for my younger son - another room to grow with - and the colors are great - really different from the first room. He loves the room - we painted planes on the wall and have large and small model planes and pilot cap,flight wings, and a real propeller on the wall - It is a very versatile theme that will be approptiate for years. I am already planning on how I will convert the bumper to pillows, as he will be going to a bed soon. I agree with the earlier review that bumper tabs too short to tie around crib, so may not be appropriate for very young child."
3,so cute so expensive,"My son's room is airplane themed but I couldn't bring myself to spend $189 on this bedding set. The only airplane is on the quilt and the sheet. I bought the sheet separately and bought inexpensive bumpers and ruffle. As for the quilt, I heard not to use heavy quilts because of the risk of SIDS. If I spent the $189 I would have just hung the quilt on his wall. It is a beautiful set altogther and is excellent quality though. I am still envious every time I see it at the store!"
4,Great choice to get up to speed on Final Cut,"This book has been a perfect aid to help me learn Final Cut Pro in preparation for completing several video projects I am working on. Unlike the limited tutorial included with program this book gives a solid introduction to all the major areas of Final Cut. Going through the chapters gave me enough foundation both to get actual work done and to explore the deeper features of FCP on my own. The only criticism I have is that the section on Color Correction is slight considering it is one of the features the program is known for. Overall, I would say Final Cut Pro for Dummies is great book to get an editor up and working with Final Cut Pro."
2,A confusing read,"Some areas of the book are pretty strong, but overall I found this book to be poorly organized and written in a confusing fashion. Some sections barely skim the surface of topics, while others seem to go into great technical detail about stuff you'll likely never use. In several instances, I actually felt like I was learning in SPITE of the book -- and that's not the feeling you want out of a how-to book. Not terrible, but I'd consider a different book if you're looking to learn Final Cut."
5,These guys together at their best!,"Metheny, Burton, Swallow, Weber etc... Together these guys are amazing! Playing some Chick Corea, awesome. Two basses, Steve Swallow and Eberhard Weber together. It doesn't get any better than this one."
5,A most interesting encounter,"To me there are no surprises on this album, I bought the LP when it first came out in 1976. I do not often buy the CD's of records I already have on LP, but I regard this one as a very special one, two great bass players; Swallow and Weber, and the first album with Pat Metheny in Burtons group without Mick Goodrick. The two highlights in my opinion are Corea's Sea Journey and Weber's Yellow Fields. A really great album, all the more important as Weber recently stopped performing for health reasons (According to what I've been told)"
2,Lots of Examples...but Many Are Not Valid,"This book has a lot more practice exams than you will find in most books. However, there are many questions on the exams that are simply not valid. For example, the book asks several questions regarding a topic called ""L'Hopital's Rule"". This rule is NOT a part of the AB curriculum at all. Then there are some examples that are CLEARLY calculator type problems, yet they appear in the ""non-calculator"" portion of the model tests. Not the worst book out there, but it may make you feel more confused after completing it. It has the potential to be a great book, but the publishing company desperately needs a new editor for a future edition."
3,A WORLD OF NEW PROPHETS,"This book describes most of the individuals who have played a role in cults and new faiths since the 19th Century. The book is a good source for those looking into the lives of the leaders themselves, but does not tell us much about the religions or the people who joined them."
2,I realy really wanted to like this one,"I sounded like the perfect blend of the Challange of an RPG and the Online Community of a Massive Roleplayer. Unfortunatly from a Roleplayers point of view it's just another massive multiplayer repeating the same quests over and over, grinding, farming, ect. ect. The only thing is it does have a nice D&D ""Feel"" about it with all the newly trademarked monsters, it's also got solid graphics and such but in reality it's not close to an RPG and the tech support for paying a monthly subscription service is terrible."
5,DDO is the best!,"DDO is a great MMO. It's very unique and although it doesn't hit the actual Dungeons and Dragons on the nail, those who enjoy playing D&D will find this game very interesting. I was skeptical at first when I heard of an online version of D&D and thought, ""that's stupid. You'll NEVER get the freedom of actual D&D"". But despite those feelings, I absolutely LOVED the game. It's still updating every month or so and still gets better and better."
2,Solo need not apply,"I'm going to keep this short and to the point. There is very little solo content in this game. It reminds me much more of Guild Wars than WoW, DAoC, EQ or EQ II. The only MMO going on in this game is when your waiting for a group (which you must be a part of to quest in a practical manner). I joined up for the head start preorder but after playing the game, I'll probably never pay them a dime to play once my ""free"" 30 days is up. Honestly I feel like I just tossed $50 plus out the window. I can only hope Vanguard is better."
1,Is this REAL?,"When i received my latest order of this product the bottle was of a different design and the scent different. I checked with the manufacturer, YSL and was told that the product was discontinued 18 months ago!"
4,Yugoslavia!,"Mr. Hall presents an unbiased view of the people of late Yugoslavia, and mixes the history in with the people he has personal encounters with. This a good book to read if one wants to know about pre-Kosovo."
4,Review of Joseph Floyd Clymer's Steam Car Scrapbook,This is a very interesting book full of facts and pictures of old-time steam cars that belong to bygone days. It's a book that older generations and young that are mechanically inclined will truly enjoy.
4,They are drip pans... they do what they should.,The are sturday drip pans. They do what they are suppose to do.
2,Sole wears out very quickly,"For a shoe that had so much promise going in, I would definitely not recommend them. While they have a nice look to them, the sole wears out much quicker than it should. If you live in a city like I do (NYC) where walking everywhere is a way of life, please go in a different direction."
3,Brown/Whiskey are excellent shoes black are horrible,"I have owned probably 5 pairs of these in black and 4 in brown. For some reason the insoles on the black ones all have worn out directly under the right big toe within a few months for unknown reasons while the brown pairs have never had this issue. They are very comfortable but unfortunately due to this insole wearing out problem i'll be switching to something else this time for my black shoes. If you are ordering a pair or whiskey/brown shoes these are a solid 5 star shoe, the black ones though are 1 star garbage. There must be some type of manufacturing difference in the insoles of the black and brown shoes that causes the black ones to be much less durable. And before someone asks why I went through multiple pairs of the black ones the answer is that I hate going to actual shoe stores and trying them on, once I find something that fits I stick with it but in this case i'll be forced to visit the shoe store."
2,Hole in the sole!,"I've never reviewed an item on Amazon before and I just want to help someone else not make the mistake I made in buying these shoes. I bought them in August 2011 and really liked them - comfortable, looked great, easy on/off, etc. After three months, in which I 'd estimate I wore them approximately 25 times, there is now a crack/hole in the left sole. I didn't notice this until today, the first day I wore them in the rain - my foot got soaked due to water coming in the sole. For $75 these should definitely have lasted longer than 3 months of not even every-other-day use. Too late to get a refund or anything so hopefully someone else reads this and avoids the same issue!"
5,nice comfort,very comfortable and look good. i prefer a thinner leather sole but completely happy with these as the sole seems everlasting.
3,a pity,It is quite nice but the single voice is very hard to hear and so my head tries and strains to hear it. But the collective recitation/prayers are lovely.If you have another song or group of songs playing before and after then this makes for a problem.It's a pity the sound or recording quality wasn't better.
1,"Do not purchase, this product sells for under $3 in stores",Google this product and you will find that the same 24-pack sells for under $3/pack.
4,Useful,"I am a speech therapist and found this book to be a useful addition to my library, although I would suggest that anyone looking for information on autism check out multiple sources. There are simply too many viewpoints out there and too many different techniques for any one book to be 'the' book on treating autism. Also, this book was published in 2002 and at this point many of the suggestions will probably be nothing new to anyone familiar with the fundamentals of social skills training, using visual aides, and incorporating sensory techniques into therapy.This book gives a good, balanced overview of how to effectively work with an autistic child. There were also a number of good suggestions and ideas for how to plan therapy sessions. I found some of the suggested activities to be a bit mis-matched in terms of ability level - some of the suggested 'games' for very basic skills, for example, seemed too complex for children working at such a beginning level. Overall, though, a good resource."
5,As good as it gets,One cannot choose what is the greatest profile - the Hemingway piece from 1950 or the greatest piece ever on Richard Pryor.Every one of the profiles here is a testament to what made the New Yorker the New Yorker - way back when.
5,Delightful and Revealing Profiles,"Hemingway, Baryishnikov, and Henry Luce are the subjects of some of my favorite celebrity profiles in this wonderful book. But topping my list is ""Man Goes to See a Doctor"", the awesome Adam Gopnik's sweet and funny rendering of his shrink. Here's a snippet: ""Your problems remind me of"" - and here he named one of the heroes of the New York School. ""Fortunately, you suffer from neither impotence nor alcoholism. This is in your favor."" Highly recommended!"
3,Hard to Find CD,"Not worth bothering to search for, either. There are hints of the later formula that would be successful on Gumbo and In The Right Place, but no songs stand out. The album was recorded in 1971 (or so I think) right before ""Gumbo""."
4,One little flaw.,"The whole time she shows the parts of the dances, she does so mirroring you. Then when she goes through the whole thing, she does it without mirroring you. When I went to do the whole thing with the video I had to put a mirror up behind me and dance with the reflection. Other than that, I enjoyed the dances."
2,Annoying clicking noise,"I bought the Weitech 1500 Pest Repeller hoping to get rid of a pesky mouse but 3 weeks later, it's still running around!The worse part of the product is the irritating clicking noise it makes, just imagine hearing your alarm clock all day, just not as loud. It's driving me crazy! I don't know what's worse the steady annoying clicking noise or knowing that the mouse is still here. I'm still hoping that it'll work because i can't imagine actually killing the mouse and trying to throw it out."
1,not worth buying,We have been using this product for 3 weeks and have not noticed an improvement in our bug problem. We still have spiders and other creepy crawleys.
4,Comfortable Bike Seat,Not much to say. The seat is gel filled and has springs and is comfortable to sit on. It is on the large size compared to standard bike seats. It is covered in a satin like fabric. It is hard to tell how the fabric will stand up to time and wear.
4,Does what it says,"Assembly and installation are easy. The hardest part is getting the lines to stay tight.If you are looking for clotheslines like your parents and grandparents had, heavy welded pipe with sturdy wire lines, you won't be happy with this. These poles are smaller with thinner metal, but unless you're hanging a half-dozen wet sleeping bags at once it will get the job done."
2,Broke within a few months,This worked well for a couple of months but now is broken. The arms of the dryer are attached by plastic brackets which have now broken and become detached. The dryer will no longer stay up. Admittedly this could be to do with our southern California sun making the plastic brittle but I would still expect a product to last a little longer than 3 months. For the price though I guess what did I expect!
1,terrible,when the product came the box was torn open and parts fell out. the holes were too small and i had to drill them larger. the hooks to hold the line came with two missing. would not order from this company again.
1,Not as advertised,This was not heavy duty as advertised.Home depot has the same thing $10.00 dollars cheaper with no shipping charges. Very disappointed in this product.
1,weak pole,"Sadly, there is not enough strength in the poles to keep them from bending even under a light load of clothes. Poorly designed."
1,Don't buy!,Broke the very first time I used it! Though I hung my laundry evenly on all sides this thing bent over like a cooked spaghetti when it got a little bit windy. The metal ripped apart! No good quality!!!
2,Works great until you tighten the line,"This line dryer was working fine until I tightened the lines. They were sagging and the clothes were sliding toward the middle of each line. I was just about done tightening the line for the 1st time when I heard a snap and the tension released. A metal arm (one of the four) that attaches via a plastic bracket to the main stem broke through the plastic near the base. All the lines sag now. The plastic cannot be repaired. Possibly replaced. But Amazon does not offer that. The line dryer is now useless. It seems to me the plastic was defective, or at a minimum a poor choice of material for this application. I've used it (lightly) about 3 mos so they will only provide a partial refund, and I pay to ship it back."
5,Hard to find clothesline,"Delivery was slower than I am accustomed to, but within a reasonable time period. Price was excellent compared to others offered on internet, heavy guage steel, wished the ID & OD had been made available. Very well pleased with clothes line posts. Assembly instructions were mangled, but assembly was easy enough. Phoned Lehigh Group for replacement of small itsems, excellent response."
1,Fall apart,"I bought this item in March of 2008 and the plastic collars, that support the arms, have already broken. This makes the clothes line useless."
1,didnt last for 1 use,"Item was installed,5 towels were hung.Brackets snapped. Not one, but several. Unsure if it was cracked before , but its garbage now"
3,Clothes dryer does the job,"Only one negative criticism; the couplings are made of plastic, rather than metal, which are subject to cracking under stress."
1,Used twice and it broke,I used this item just twice to hang up small loads of laundry and one of the plastic hinges snapped. This is made from flimsy material and is a total waste of money.
1,Not strong at all,"Bought on March 20,2011 now having to purchase another because this one fell apart, due to the wind but it was suppose to be strong and you were suppose to be able to hang out quilts on it, I doubt it ! there goes forty five dollars plus shipping gone within a years time"
4,Clothes Dryer,The Crawford Lehigh Clothes Dryer is an ecology saving answer to the need conserve energy and at the same time save money. Using the sun's rays to dry white items gives them a sparkling white finish and the wind gives them a fresh smell. Neither whiteness nor smell is available from a machine that dries clothes. This dryer installs with ease and takes up a small area in the yard. The only drawback is that the lines are spaced so close that maximum drying time is impaired. This minus is easily overcome by hanging not using every line to hang clothes. Using every second or third lines provides good drying. The surprising positive feature is the amply quantity of clothes that it accommodates. It is an excellent substitute for a drying machine.
1,already broken,The plastic bracket on one of the arms broke as I was setting the clothesline up. I am not optimistic about the quality of this item. It is already duct taped together and doesn't seem heavy duty enough to hold a load of towels or jeans. I am very disappointed and hoping to be proven wrong!
4,Worth buying,I wish I had bought this dryer at the beginning of Spring. I have used it a lot since I have purchased it and it works well. Nothing nicer than the smell of fresh laundry straight off the dryer. Hoping to save money on our electric bill too. The clothes line itself could be a little stronger but it just needs tightening up now and then. Glad I bought it.
3,umbrella clothesline,"The item arrived promptly. There was some problem with the inital raising of the clothesline, the top button on the pole was stuck and we had to take it apart to fix it but once the clothesline was raised it has worked exactly as it should and I am very pleased with it."
1,weak clothesline,"I've had nothing but problems with this clothesline. The 1st time I hung clothes on the line, the line tension disappeared, and the clothes were hanging down to the ground. Adjusting the tension did not work, as the umbrella would fall down after a while, and I had to insert nails into the holes to keep it up. That seemed to work ok, but then we had a heavy rain in the area, and this caused the the concrete and plastic sleeve to pop out of the ground, and the entire line to fall over into the wet grass. (I followed the instructions carefully to install it- dug the hole to the depth required, inserted the sleeve and concrete, etc.) Also, because the entire thing fell, a flimsy aluminum arm bent. This will not be repairable. I do not recommend this clothesline! I'll have to get another to replace it."
4,you know,"I was real happy with this purchase, from start to finish. The clothes dryer was more than I expected."
1,Damaged in Shipping,"This item was shipped in a large plastic bag. The pole and one of the bars was badly dented in shpping - there was no protection, a cardboard carton would have prevented this. As it was a late Christmas gift I didn't open it until early February. Is it too late to return??"
3,No so Satisfied,"I was under the impression that I would not need to cement this down. I was wrong, so this item was not what I expected."
4,You won't get hung out to dry on this one,"I liked this product in general. It was an easy set-up, and it's convenient, but for my purposes, the lines are too close together, and they sometimes sag. Other than that, I would recommend it."
2,Dissapointed with Purchase,"I was really excited about the price of this item, but not with the product. The lines will not stay tight and sag. I like the convenience of drying my clothes in the fresh air and it saves on energy. I will definitely still use the clothes dryer, but I wish that there was a way to tighten the lines better."
4,Good environmental choice,"After using this clothes dryer several times over the past week, I'm very satisfied with it. It arrived in good shape (a concern I had after reading some of the reviews). It seems fairly sturdy and it's lightweight enough to take in and out. We loaded it down the first time and it stood the test. While it's not necessarily designed to spin in the wind, it does move easily, helping with drying and with hanging clothes without having to move ourselves.We installed it by first concreting the sleeve in a square concrete block, then burying and concreting the entire block in the ground. That made leveling it much easier. Overall, a good product."
4,a great improvement,"I bought this to replace the unsightly clothesline strung between a couple trees. I really like it. I like that I can take it into the garage when I'm not using it and keep it out of sight. It weighs next to nothing. I may be wrong, but it also seems to dry the clothes faster than the old clothesline and holds 3 times as much. And no more worries about the lawnmower person getting ""hung up."""
1,"Unfortunately, part broken","I was so excited to get this dryer, but as my husband put it up, we saw that one of the parts was broken! I can still use it, but it is lopsided and there is no tension. I hope to be able to contact the maker so that we can order the broken part. I don't know if it really is repairable. Other than that, it is exactly what I wanted!"
1,worse online purchase ever!,"We used this clothesline for the first time today, as I purchased it last month. The top bracket jammed with the bottom bracket and after an hour of trying to pry these brackets apart, we just gave up. Since we had installed it inside our pool enclosure, with it being locked in the open position we could not get it out of our door. We therefore crushed it to pieces to be able to remove it.NEVER AGAIN!"
5,Hang it out to dry,My wife was very happy with this purchase. Not only was it light weight and easy to use. My wife said she able to hang four loads of laundry on it.
1,Damaged goods,"I purchased this line online and had it shipped to Jamaica. Arriving in a plastic bag, with NO carton or any form of protection, it arrived bent and broken. Absolutely no use to me at all. VERY disappointed"
2,Shipping Woe's,"Well, this would be a great dryer, If it made the shipping treck, Pastic slide hinge's were broken when it came."
1,Piece of Junk,"I ordered this from Amazon this because it was made of aluminum and wouldn't rust out in the weather, and it would be a nice little clothes dryer except for one thing - the plastic clips that hold the arms together. One of them broke before I even got it set up. Two more are now broken and I have only used it three times. I didn't return it because my husband thinks he can replace the plastic pieces with something that will last. I wouldn't recommend this clothes dryer to anyone."
1,wouldnt recommend,"Ordered 2 of these items and both were damaged when I received them. Not impressed, I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Broke the first time we used it,This is the second time I have had this product. The first clothesline lasted a year. This one didn't last a day. The plastic connectors are weak and easily break. Both clotheslines broke in the same manner. The new one was sold under a different brand so I ordered it. It was the same product under a different name. I would never had bought the second one if I had known it was the same clothesline. Save yourself the trouble and buy a different product. This one is weak and poorly made.It doesn't even deserve one star.
3,Could have been so good.,"The clothesline had two broken brackets when it arrived. For now I can make it work but because two of the arms don't secure properly I have to stand in a chair to put laundry on two sides. And that's saying something considering I'm 5'10"". I will be getting a new clothesline, just not this one."
1,Too lite weight,This product was disappointing as it was made from a very lite weight aluminum. I've always used outdoor (umbrella) clothes lines and found this one to be a waste of money.
4,Just the job!!,"This is just like the ones they have in the UK, but which I see rarely in the US. Seems solid enough though it would be nice if the plastic joints were a bit more substantial. We have rarely used the electric drier since. It just needs to be dry outside and preferably a bit of wind for this thing to work.To install it, I used a piece of 2"" galvanized pipe with a nail across the bottom instead of the plastic base that came with it and hammered the pipe into the lawn - works great.Recommended if you are trying to save a bit of energy and be a bit more ""green""."
1,Crawford-Lehigh Rotary Clothesline,"Item is a great 'weight' and very easy to use...BUT the plastic brackets that hold the arms 'closed' and support the lines when open break VERY easily. The first time I used this, one of the brackets broke; then the second time I used it, yet another bracket broke. It would be a SUPER item if they could come up with a solution for the plastic brackets. Do NOT recommend until the 'bracket issue' is resolved."
3,"Great Camera, with an exception","Camera works pretty good, however ezonics does not include the correct driver in the software package so you have to find it online, which is not a problem.Since Windows has been updating their os files, if you run win2k and have service pack 3 or higher, the camera will only function as a webcam as you will be unable to retrieve your pictures from the camera if you use it as a digi cam, which I found incredibly annoying. this has been a problem for several months, and only because of this am I thinking of getting another camera.I do like the camera, like the size, not to big nor too small."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"I just bought this item to finish up my balance with a given gift card. It is so unfriendly especially in te interface, that still have not used it. Frankly, do not recommended it to anyone. It would be better to spend more in a better item.Juan L.Weston; Florida"
1,Victor Tin Cat Solid Top,I purchased two Victor Tin Cat (solid top) and have bated with Peanut Butter. I have had them in the correct locations for about a week or more. I have caught absolutely no mice. This house is over-run with mice so I know they are there. These traps cost much more than the kill traps so I am stuck with two useless metal boxes. Don't believe all the good reviews you see. If you try it don't order more that one until you see if it will work or not. I will probably return these.
2,"Worked for a friend, but not me.",This worked for a friend of mine and he caught lots of mice with it.The mice in in my house are a bit smarter. Evolution? Victor!!!! I need a better mouse trap!
2,Looks good but no mice,Seems the mice are unimpressed. The Havahart is harder to use but the mice seem to find it irresistible even though it is a pain to bait and set.
2,"The mouse enter, eat.... then leave!","It's worked somewhat well in that the mice go for the bait, but three times now, with three different traps, they've gone in and feasted and are somehow able to get out. Am I missing something here?!"
1,well made...but doesn't trap mice....,"I have many mice in the garage and the attic and have yet to catch a mouse using this trap...I have followed the instructions precisely and have not caught a thing in three weeks...I refuse to use snap traps again,(even though they certainly work),to inhumane! Is there such a thing as the perfect mouse trap?A follow up to this review...I started using this again once the weather got a bit a colder and I have since caught 15 of the little critters in 7 days!!!!"
4,works well,"I had a couple of these used by a professional service that they left behind. Worked well and I wanted another for additional locations. In theory, you don't need bait and they do work as is. i have found that peanuts in the shell have a good shelf life when used and make them a bit more effective."
1,Mice smarter than a Tin Cat,"We've had this a year now. We've tried different foods and located it in different places but regardless of what we have tried, the mice have avoided it. The mice went for the harder eats, like the covered trashcan and pet food containers.Pass on this one."
4,Tin cat a success,"We recently relocated to a new state, and secured a house to rent. The house came with a few mice, which wasn't apparent until we had moved in. I didn't want to kill the mice, I just didn't want to live with them. My daughter-in-law told me she had purchased a ""live mouse trap"", so I searched the internet to find a product. I found Tin Cat, and bought two. I set the traps out, and the next morning I had three mice. I let them out at the end of our street (about 1/2 mile) in the woods. I haven't see any mice since. I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,Mice don't check in...,"I ordered two of these mousetraps in August of 2010. I chose the product because it was very similar to another brand I purchased months before. That product caught mice, but was made of plastic and after emptying the trap three times (It caught five mice for me) the little buggers managed to chew enough damage to render it useless.Unfortunately this promising metal trap is unattractive to mice. After five months with it in the same location I've only caught two mice. I started putting conventional baited spring traps in the same area and I have to empty them every day, so I know the expensive metal traps aren't doing the job."
1,nada zilch zero,"while my snap traps in my garage caught 10 mice this caught none. had some droppings inside however!!!! this was over about 6 weeks.jan 2012--------------this is an update........ this unit is being used outside around the house-----------caught about 4 after a few months, following the instructions. after loading it up with peanut buttrer, I had more success. now caught about 18 total. so not so bad. 3 stars perhaps."
2,Tin Cat mouse trap M310 bought on amazon,I bought three of these traps. I tried using the trap without baiting it and that did not seem to work. I used a reese's peanut butter cup and caught two mice in the trap but it says they cannot get out and it holds 30 mice so I left the two mice and when I went back to see if I caught anymore the two mice had gotten out. I am trying the other two traps to see if they work any better. The cover did not open on the top so they had to have gotten out the tunnels.
2,Victor Tin Cat Mouse Trap,"The slits/holes on the sides are big enough for the mice to slip through (1/4"" is plenty of room for them squeeze through) but the edges are sharp and I am afraid they will cut themselves trying to get out. I bought it as a catch and release trap because I just want to catch them, not harm them. I haven't used it yet for this reason."
2,Works sometimes,"Bought this one and didn't catch a thing for a week. My husband adjusted it slightly, and we have finally caught two mice. However, we bought a green plastic trap and have caught 7 with it. This works, but not as effectively as others."
2,Doesn't last,"The basement of our apartment building was a mouse factory and they were coming up through unpluggable holes so I bought two of these Victor M310 TIN CAT live mouse traps. They worked great at first, but now the gates or doors don't open and close properly and the mice run in and out. An expensive short-term solution."
3,Caught some mice,"Caught mice but is messy and hard to open without letting live mice get away. I ordered a ""Ketch All"" and the drowning attachment and like it much better. It's better to kill the mice than letting them go because they are filthy and carry disease. I don't want to let them go somewhere so they go into someone else's house and I'm not going to drive out to the country everyday to turn them loose. I just need to get these mice under control before they get in the house. I use it in the aviary where they have over run it."
1,Live Mouse Trap,"I would never buy this trap again! I thought I would be doing the humane thing and not kill one of God's creatures, but the darn thing doesn't catch even a stink bug! Waste of Money!!!!"
4,tin cat works great,"I USED ONE OF THESE 30 YEARS AGO IN A HORSE BARN WITH GREAT SUCCESS. IM NOT A MOUSE LOVER AND NOT INCLINED TO RELEASE THE PESKY CRITTERS, AT THAT TIME I HAD A NEIGHBOR WITH EXOTIC SNAKES WHO BOUGHT ALL THE MICE I COULD CATCH FOR A NICKLE A MOUSE, KEPT MY HORSES IN TREATS. RECENTLY I HAD TO GO ON A HUNT TO FIND A SOURCE FOR THESE TRAPS AS I COULDN'T FIND THEM LOCALLY. NOW I PLACE THE TRAP MICE AND ALL IN A BUCKET OF WATER AND THEN DISPOSE OF THE DEAD MICE. YOU DO NEED TO CHECK THE TRAPS DAILY SO THE MICE DON'T DIE OR SUFFER FROM THIRST LEFT UNATTENDED.THE TRAP WORKS BEST BAITED WITH PEANUTBUTTER. PLACED IN CORNERS OR ALONG WALLS. WITH OUT THE WIND UP MECHANISM OF THE OTHER GALVANIZED MOUSE TRAP THERE IS LITTLE TO GO WRONG WITH THEM. THEY DO TEND TO RUST FROM THE SALT I USE ON MY HAY AND FREQUENT DUNKING IN WATER."
2,Stopped working after one week and catching 5 mice.,"Our Victor M310 TIN CAT Live Mouse Trap initially worked great. The first night we caught 2 mice. The next three nights we caught one each night. Then we did not catch anymore. Then we noticed fresh mouse droppings inside the trap with all the bait gone.It was working wonderfully, but now I am afraid that they either figured out how to get out, or there is something that is no longer working with the trap, such as the door."
1,Piece of JUNK,"We've tried to catch several field mice in our house. I baited it with dog food, peanut butter and bread. The mice go right around it. Not worth a dime. I'm getting some glue traps - hate to kill the mice but they need to go."
2,Horrendous shipping method,"I don't know what's wrong with this company, they simply do not know how to ship their products. I read the other review where the product was badly damaged and assumed it was a fluke. That stuff happens once in a while. I got my package and immediately knew something was wrong. It looked like a car had run over it. I opened it, the base was dented, but worse, some plastic piece had broken off and jammed into the lighting fixture, making it impossible to screw in a bulb and impossible to use the lamp. Had to return it. I order a ton of stuff from Amazon and hardly ever return anything. Amazon's return service has been wonderful as always, but seriously, you're a LIGHTING company, learn how to pack lights."
2,Disappointed!,"Before ordering this lamp, which arrived today, I checked carefully all over the web, reading reviews, and comparison shopping. I was very disappointed with the quality of the lamp. I'm keeping it because it's too much trouble to repack and re-ship (which I think manufacturers count on), but the metal had small dings in two places, and was bent in another. It was easy to assemble (once I used pliers to ""unbend"" the part) and will suit its purpose until I find something better, but that's the best I can say. This experience will prevent me from ordering from this manufacturer again."
5,Lite Source Floor Lamp from Amazon,"This lamp is perfect for my purpose. It is small, and I can make it shine on my chair where I'm reading or adjust it to shine on my computer. The color is excellent."
3,small person far away,"It is a beautiful book,but it doesn't go along with the expectations of a person, who had read it's other sequels. This is one beautiful biography ,which holds you till the end."
3,Does not do justice to the first two books of Anna's life.,"I enjoyed this final volume of Anna's tale, but I think it would have been better to use it to round out The Other Way Round. A lot of what was written was just trying to do ""catch up"" for new readers. The writer, it seemed, did not have enough ""distance"" from her mother before she wrote it. It appears as though she was working through a lot of ""stuff"" that should have been done before she wrote the piece. Still, I wanted to know what happened; it was just kind of boring and disappointing after the first two books."
3,Too Many Complex - But Good Recipes,"I've made a few really good items from this book. For the most part, the recipes are very busy for a one pot meal. Long ingredient lists and a good number of semi exotic items throughout the book. For weekend cooking where you have the time - its a good book - WW has a dud in this one."
5,"Excellent cookbook, whether you are on WW or not!","Weight Watchers In One Pot (200 Favorite One-Dish Meals the Family Will Love)is full of delicious and easy-to-make recipes that also happen to be healthy. There is a great section of vegetarian recipes, and the desserts are so yummy that you'll never believe they are good for you! One recipe not to miss is the Chicken Posole, a hearty Mexican stew. It's a favorite of everyone in my family who has had it. It is our go-to cookbook, and it would be a great deal at twice the price."
2,"not so great, do real people eat like this?","So many of these recipes use strange or expensive items, it just isn't practical for a family, maybe for singles or couples."
5,"screeching, grating, and brilliant","This is a re-release of Sigur Ros's debut Icelandic album, now in the US for the first time. It's far more atmospheric than the recent releases, with long passages of screaming, merging with angelic, tonally strange choral music, back into silence and disconcerting sound. The album is quite evocative--and conjures imagery more effectively than ( ), which almost becomes a rock opera by comparison. Particularly in the earlier tracks, the music seems to have been produced in a massive, wide-open space, far out in darkness, on a freezing night. It's chilling, and quite interesting. This isn't an album I would recommend for the car, necessarily; but it's an extremely powerful soundscape, and a great key to understanding one of the more innovative bands out there."
2,The 1997 Sigur Ros,"It's a mediocre album, and very different from Agaetis Byrjun and ""( )"". I think it's safely my third favorite of the three I mentioned.I'm probably not the most die-hard fan, but I am familiar with all of the biographical info that most of the previous reviewers seem to know.If you are wondering whether the album is a worthwhile listen/purchase, I think the answer is ""maybe"", assuming that you enjoy ethereal music, and it helps to be familiar with their later releases. Some of the tracks seem like nothing more than Halloween sound effects. I give it about 2.5 stars. I prefer to recommend some songs by the Cocteau Twins, like ""Blind Dumb Deaf"". You should really listen to this album before you buy it,because it might disappoint you. Stick to ""( )"" Or ""Agaetis Byrjun""."
1,I can't find anything to like...,"Let me start by saying that I absolutely adore Sigur Ros, but this album is just horrible. Sigur Ros is a band that can be quite inconsistent. One minute they can have one of the most beautiful pieces of music you will ever hear (Vaka off of ( ) is probably the best example that comes to mind) and then they can drone on into mediocrity the next. This album is a large collection of the latter unfortunately. It was nothing but a random collection of noises and nothing else. I cannot imagine anyone being able to listen to this and come away with anything meaningful to remember. I can only redeem myself in buying it from a collecting standpoint, otherwise, this is probably the most excruciating album to listen to that I own..."
2,PROJECT RECORDS---LYCIA,"IT'S SAD TO HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ETHEREAL MUSIC WITHOUT MENTIONING THE TRUE PIONEERS OF IT. PROJECT RECORDS, LYCIA AND SO MANY ARTISTS ON PROJECT RECORDS LIST, HAVE FOR LONG CREATED SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SURREAL SOUNDSCAPES EVER HEARD BY ANY MUSIC LOVER! IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE MAIN STREAM MUSIC LOVER HAS PUT SIGUR ROS ON A THRONE, AFTREALL A FLOCK OF SHEEP ONLY SEE AND HEAR WHAT THEY ARE NICELY GIVEN BY THE ESTABLISHMENT. SIGRUS ROS IS GOOD BUT NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL!"
4,rough recordings of classic material,"This rather dubious collection gathers some very old material from the dawn of John Lee Hooker's lengthy career. I paid under $5 for mine and was very happy. This is the grittiest, meanest, STOMPINEST that the Hook ever got - too bad there are no liner notes to tell where this material originated. My guess would be late 1940's material (I have a couple of these on another vinyl lp). Although the sound is quite rough, you can still rock the house with these, and they're very hard to find on other collections."
4,Very good opera,"If you like Donizetti operas, you will enjoy this production of Roberto Devereux. (I had previously seen the DG DVD with Gruberova, etc. which I did not enjoy because of the ridiculous staging.) This performance is beautifully staged and costumed and very well sung and conducted Theodossiou pp singing in the last scene is especially well done, although some of her ff singing was a little shrill."
4,large paper clips,The paper clips were good quality and I hadn't realized the quantity ordered. We will have enough paper clips to last for several years of at-home use.
2,"Not really ""clips""","I needed to clip some paper together so naturally I did a search and found this product. The name sure sounded like what I needed, but be warned that these are falsely advertized. They don't ""clip"" at all, but merely tightly hold paper together by sliding the paper between the two ends. And I don't know about you, but I love potato chips and sometimes I don't eat the whole bag in one sitting, so I thought these might also be able to re-seal the bag to keep my chips fresh for later. WRONG. The bag slides right out of these things. I'll be putting these on e-bay."
5,Great price great product,"There isn't much to say, they are paper clips...however, it is the best price and the paper clips are thick, not cheap and flimsy. We reuse ours at the office time and time again."
5,EXCELLENT QUALITY AND SERVICE,"When I realized we were short of paper clips, this company was the only one that came through as trying to make sure this product is exactly what would meet our needs. The service was impeccable, the item was shipped on the day it was promised."
2,Not very strong,"I thought that these paper clips looked like an excellent value - I have purchased ACCO clips in the past, but not the ""jumbo"" size; I never had any complaints about their regular-sized clips. I had assumed that these would be the same gauge of wire that their regular-size clips are, but these seem to be a much thinner gauge that barely holds onto a few pieces of paper."
1,These Acco paper clips suck,"(ASIN: B00006IBK8) I haven't any samples, as Robin has, but am willing to take his word after less than one month using these. They are the pits. If anyone dared to stuff 20 pages within one of them, the clip would probably shoot off and land on Mars. I find I am using two where I would normally use one, because they do not grip the pages well. Yuck. I don't have time for this. Shame on you, Acco."
5,paper clips,they came on time and now i have more paper clips then i know what to do with.and a couple of years.
1,A bunch of covers,These are not the original artists and Johnny Bond is not even represented on this cd. Try to find the late 70's issue LP instead.
4,In the Line of Duty 4,"Donnie Yen movie -- awesome. He plays a cop in Seattle of all places. The female lead actress Cynthia Khan is fabulous. She is another Michelle Yeoh. The movie revolving Donnie and Cynthia having to go to Hong Kong to retrieve a suspect in a murder case. The lead detective also works for the CIA who is selling drugs to raise money for some of their other ventures and the suspect that Donnie and Cynthia are looking for happens to be a guy that was in the wrong place at the wrong time. What this poor guy goes throughout this movie is something. The lead detective and Donnie are partners and Donnie can't belive he is dirty until toward the end of the movie. Again don't want to spoil the movie, it is worth watching."
4,"Donnie Yen. In the Line of duty 4, purchased from Amazon.com","A fun action film, lots of crazy stunts, and great fights scenes. It is not Donnies best film, but it is very close, I am a fan of his,so if you are, its a must for your collection."
3,"Terrible story, good fight scenes","If you're half-way bright then you can follow the story, but it's really tiring. The story is trash anyway so it's useless to even spend any time caring who is who and why they want to kill eachother, so just watch the fights. Now the fights are decent, but the best part is the very end with Donnie Yen and the swoll cat he is fighting on the roof... one of the coolest fight scenes I have ever seen. This is a good add to your collection if you are a Donnie Yen fan, or have exhausted pretty much all the other good martial arts movies you can find. You probably won't watch it much after the first time tho - except the end of course."
3,Borrow from the library or a friend if you can,Donnie Yen and Cynthia Khan are both excellent martial artists so all their action sequences are OK.Overall production values and story are mediocre. Donnie Yen looks too young for his role.
1,Fighting scenes too slow. Same Storyline as other movies.,I bought this movie because Donnie Yen is listed as one of the actors. What a disappointment it is. The fighting scenes are so slow that it looks like they fighter are rehearsing not fighting.The color is faded. The storyline is the same old as others.It is a waste of time and money. I wish I could return it.
2,ONLY ancient and modern villas (no in-between),"Like the previous reviewer said, the villas depicted here seem empty...Probably cause they have no furniture!I'll bet the authors just took a tour of Italian villas turned into museums to get their shots. Half the villas are in Italy and seem like they are ruins or 'open to the public'. They are more like palaces instead of homes. The modern villas are TOO modern. You know what I mean: box-like or angular stark structures that resemble commercial buildings rather than traditional houses. Fallingwater does have floorplans & is furnished so it was the only villa I liked."
4,Magic loops,My wife observed a young boy playing with this toy while waiting for transportation one day and wanted to get one to entertain the kids. Able to manipulate into many shapes. I had to repair a defective crimp on one of the pieces without further issue. Not unusual with an imported product anymore it seems.
3,Breaks easy,"I liked this a lot until the first ring came off. Then the rest of them did the same thing. However, with a pair of pliers, I was able to hook them back on, but the loops never matched their initial out of the box performance."
3,small,A nice fun little gadget was nice to give to the kids to keep them occupied for a few minutes.
1,it broke as soon as i got it,i bought it with all my allowance and it broke the day i got it and it is not well made at all at allllllllllllllllll
5,Excellent Book!!,I learned a lot from this book. It has an amazing collection of not only common sense but innovation and a workable system to help you take advantage of the information. I highly recommend it. Teamwork is absolutely the way to achieve the highest results possible.
3,Good but next higher model better,The Swingline 12 hole does a good job but the number of sheets is too low and is a bit awkward to use. The next higher model does 20 sheets and can be stored more compactly.
5,Easy to USE,"This is a wonderful machine--it's so easy to use--even for my 82-year old husband. Several sheets at a time are no problem, either. So glad I found it."
5,The best 3-hole Punch!,"Swingline makes great office supplies anyway, so I am not surprised that this 3 hole punch is no exception. I love it. It's sturdy, easy to use, punches 5-10 sheets at a time. The punch dies are also removable and adjustable. I have one at the office and I love it so much, I ordered one for home."
2,Cute but the reviews were right!,"We bought the in flight border after reading the reviews, and were prepared for the worst. Everything went fine at first and it appeared that we had beat the odds, however we went to check on the border to see how it was drying and it was falling off the wall. We are out to the store tomorrow for wall paper glue. It is cute though and will be great once it stays on the wall."
1,The glue falls right off...,I wish the bad reviews had been posted before purchacing this product. The glue falls off before you can get it onto the wall. Talk about a headache. Now we have wasted a great deal of money and time.
2,Looks is the only reason to buy it,"The glue doesn't work, purchase your own glue. We did blue on the top and green on the bottom and it looks great."
2,a drippy mess that doesn't stick,"We did the blue/tan coordinating paint job and I LOVE the way it looks now that it's finished, but I had never worked with wallpaper before and ended up having the same problem as many others. Despite my attempts to follow the (very limited) instructions, the glue just didn't stick and all of my edges came up. I had to buy extra adhesive and go back over everything. What a pain."
4,does anyone have extra?,"I am in need of an extra 4 feet of this border, does anyone have some left over? If so, please email me at: mollylorenz@mchsi.com"
2,Cute but hardly worth it!,"Okay, So I read all of the reviews and thought that as a seasoned wall paper hanger no biggie. I'll just get some paste and use that on the paper to help hang it. WRONG! My friend and I took 5 hours hanging a small 10x11 room. It was a nightmare. The quality of the border is aweful, it has more paperlike qualities verses a vinyl. So after you start to work it onto your wall it stretches more than 1/16th of an inch. So if you ran out in a spot and need to match the lines up it doesn't look like they are the same size. Also it seemed whether I wet it and followed the diections to the letter or I used paste it didn't stick on the tops and bottoms. I surely hope after all that money spent for a cute matching border and all the work to get it up on the wall. I hope it stays up and doesn't start falling down. What a disaster. I gave the review two stars because it is really cute and it matches perfect, if it stays up....."
2,Love the theme...Hate the border!!!,"I absolutly love the Baby Martex In Flight nursery set. However, this is the poorest quality border I've ever used in all my life! Not only does it not want to stick (no matter what you do), but it is expensive to boot. My husband and I had to spring for additional glue just to get it to stay on the wall."
1,AVAILABILITY,"I RATED THIS PRODUCT ONE STAR NOT BECAUSE OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF, BUT BECAUSE I RAN OUT AND CAN'T BUY MORE. IT IS NOW ALMOST MARCH, AND MY BABY SHOWER WAS IN NOVEMBER. I BOUGHT TWO ROLLS OF BORDER THINKING IT WOULD COVER THE ENTIRE NURSERY, BUT I AM IN NEED OF ONE MORE ROLL. I HAVE BEEN TO ALL OF THE STORE LOCATIONS AND TRIED TO ORDER ONLINE, BUT THE MANUFACTURER CAN'T SEEM TO STOCK IT. THE BORDER LOOKS GREAT AND IS STAYING UP WELL IN THE NURSERY, BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO FINISH THE ROOM. IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A PRODUCT...IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE CONSUMER...NOT OUT OF STOCK FOR FOUR MONTHS."
1,Isn't what I wanted,Bought this camera for webchatting with my family back home but I am not able to add any of my friends and family to the buddy list yahoo msn says it is not compatible a nd when i contacted the tech support they say the images can be viewed or an address can be added only if the other person has an EZonics camera this is really ridiculous these guys are dupping people by telling that it is compatible with other msn services.
2,EZCam Not As EZ As I Thought,"I bought the webcam, tempted by my GoldBox offer. I read all three reviews and figured 2 out of 3 wasn't bad. I wonder whether I'd be better off without a webcam than with one that works when it feels like it. It comes with little to no instructions and when you click Help on one of Ezonics' programs, a little pop up screen comes up telling you that it's Version 1.something or the other. There is no help feature if I'm having trouble and I find troubleshooting difficult. It is easy to install, but that's the only EZ part of Ezonics. I got this for [a little money]. Hold your dinero and save up for a better camera, that may be more expensive but much more user friendly. Also it has a bad habit of freezing my computer when loading.P.S. If you're looking for a video function, it's not so bad, but mere snapshots (like webcam still pics) are hard to do. I need to use the handle of a broom to take a picture of myself from a distance!"
1,S-U-C-K-S!!!,"Oh man, what a load of poo this cam is! all the footage it takes has a green tint to it no matter how good the lighting, you literally have to shine it into a bright light to get it to go to a normal tone. the software is horrible. it freezes after about 15 seconds of recording, then you have to shut the program down via Alt+Ctrl+Del and the cams light stays on afterwards. so THEN you have to comPLETELY restart your pc. this happens anytime the cam freezes. this is a COMPLETE waste of money!"
2,"Works, But Not Well","I was given this camera as a gift, so I can't complain, but I haven't been very happy with it. The image is always GREEN, and unless I have a blinding light nearby the image is always DARK. The software has been incredibly buggy and useless, and the hosting site I used was difficult to manage and eventually locked me out for some reason. I wouldn't recommend this webcam to anyone else."
2,WASTE OF $$$,this is obviously WHY ITS THE CHEAPEST WEBCAM ON AMAZON. almost all of the time i turn it on and its green so i have to go change the settings on it (which take about 10 or 15 minutes to get where its the best but its never good) and when i turn it on it boots me or a couple minutes or seconds later the computer boots) and at night its so dark you cant see your face. all that can be changed by going to the setting/ prefences but it only helps a little bit. THIS IS A WASTE OF $MONEY$!!!!!!! DONT BUY THIS IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A CAM
2,Crap,This thing sucks...the only reason i gave it two stars is because i finally got it to work on aim and can talk to my gf. The software is horrible!!! Buy something else unless your really poor.
4,Ezonics is great,"I bought the Ezonics and find the image quality very good.The lens is a bit ""long"" for chatting and you always feel like it should be a bit farther.Build quality is very good."
4,"Good trap, requires strong hands","I've been very successful at trapping moles with this trap. It was a little hard to figure out how to set it initially---the directions on the box aren't perfectly clear--but finally figured it out. It does require pretty good hand strength to set it. I used a 2 x 4 to prop the jaws of the trap open until I figured out how to set it. This trap was one of the few recommended by ""The Mole Man"" [...], whose web site it really great for learning about mole biology, habitat and how to control moles. Traps appear to be the only effective method. And this trap is certainly effective. I caught a mole the first night the trap was out and several more since."
3,needs some improvements,"This trap is VERY powerful. Easy to set, but needs improvement to trip lever. It needs wide flat piece on it, to prevent mole from slipping by. I have yet to nab one. Srarted using small, thin piece of wood, placed right under trip lever, bending lever did no good, dirt was just pushed up around it. Takes some practice getting it placed in position, need a sharp shooter that has been flattened out on the end. Great idea, just keep improving it."
2,doesn't work or just hard to set up? maybe both!,"I bought this at the same time I bought the Wire Tek ""EasySet"" Mole Trap here on Amazon, and after trying both products I have to say that the Victor ""Out O'Sight"" Mole Trap is not only 1) much more difficult to operate but also 2) less effective than the Wire-Tek one, not to mention 3) tears up your yard more. With this Victor brand one you actually have to dig a hole by hand vs. with the Wire-Tek one all you do is push it in to the ground and step on it to set it, easy as pie. That one has caught 2 moles for me so far, the Victor trap has caught 0 moles. If it wasn't such a hassle to ship stuff back, I'd return this one and buy another Wire Tek brand mole trap. Don't waste your time on this product here!"
1,Good luck with this!,"Terrible product! After 3 days of messing with it, I can't even get the thing to stay cocked. Watched the videos, read the excellent reviews, etc. Still can't get the thing to stay cocked-just releases itself before you can even get to the safety latch. Never even got close to putting them in the ground-I bought 3 of them and now I get to pay the shipping back. By the time I box them up, take them to shipping just to get the remainder of my money back-might as well just throw them away and save the aggravation. Go for it if you feel lucky."
1,Does not work in sandy soil,Live in Florida and bought 4 of these traps based on the reviews here. This trap seems rather large for the size moles we have here in Florida. The tunnels which I could find are no bigger than 1 inch. The soil is so sandy that the trigger gets covered up and the tunnels collapse when trying to set this trap. I did as suggested and leveled the fist size mounds to see where the active tunnels were which showed up the next day. Not one trap went off.As far as placing the trap with the trigger above the ground (as suggested by some reviewers here) this makes no sense as the tunnels are NOT RAISED and there is no way the trap will go off. The traps were placed with the trigger in the tunnel so the moles would go under it and trigger the trap.Anyone living in a hot sandy soil area who has found a trap that will work please post.
3,Mole traps,"Very hard to set for people who are weaker, takes a lot of strength and control. Been set now for a while and nothing caught in it."
1,Broke before it saw first use,"Strong trap, but perhaps too strong. The spring bar bent under the spring's weight very early. Afterwards it was impossible to set and would snap before it was even set in the ground. Eventually the jaw cracked in half at the top.Going to need to try something else."
1,"Been there, Done that!","This was USELESS to me and a lot of others.Difficult to set and I had no results!There is a product called ""NoMol"" it's what my EXTERMINATOR used.it's CHEAP, EFFECTIVE,but hard to find.My EXTERMINATOR trapped 10 moles last year and I've trapped 10 So Far this year!I have a lot invested in my Flower beds! these ""Criiters"" were DESTROYING them.I've tried everything from poison gummy worms to smoke bombs, Castor oil to castor beans.Gum, Bleach and contraptions like this that DO NOT WORK!Look at NoMOL on YouTUBE.... it was the ONLY thing that worked for me!The proff was always right there in that trap.20 dead Moles..... So Far!"
4,Best mole trap but needed a little tweaking,"From my reserch, this is the best mole trap out there. It does work for me but took lots of trial and error to figure out how to set it correctly. I bought two, one worked perfectly, but one had too much powder coat on the trigger pan to release properly. Don't be afraid to use pliers on it to adjust the release/ trigger pan lip to set the release force. And make sure the legs pass each other when released, one leg was slightly bent striking the other on one. What I found works best for Pacific NW moles was to dig the trap hole just barely large enough for the trap. No loose dirt on ends of trap. Clear the mole tunnel of all loose dirt with a spoon and pack the bottom solid so he doesn't dig around in the soft dirt. I used sod to cover the trap with NO dirt back fill in the hole like the instructions say. Once I found a main tunnel to set it in, its deadly!"
1,Did not work for me,I'm hesistant to give the product this low rating but it simply did not work for me. I tried on 3 separate occasions and actually saw the critter go past the trap and trigger it. Only thing I can figure is the trap is too large for my moles. I also followed the preferred method of setting these out. I plan to try again but the next time I'm going to be prepared to take care of this critter with a pitch fork if I'm lucky enough again for him to drive by while I'm laying the trap out!
1,Very difficult to set,I bought 2 of these traps and spent an hour trying to set one of them. I have decided the trigger mechanism must have been installed wrong when it was made. No way this thing will work. Sent them back. Will buy another type/brand. Save your money.
4,mole trap,"Haven't caught anything yet, but the design is better than the victor spring fork trap I had before. I'll get some mole soon :-)"
1,Not easy to set up! Too hard to use,"Of all of the several mole traps I purchased recently, this is my least favorite. It is the hardest to set up and requires some significant digging. The spring is very strong and requires some strength. In fact I never did get it set."
2,Extremely hard to set!!!,"This device may work, but I have spent hours trying to set it with little success. I finally got a large set of channel locks, got the trap to set, and attached the safety pin. I set everything up for a few days with no results. When I wanted to move it to another location, it closed so I had to start the process all over again. As I said earlier, it may work but unless your superman you will have a difficult time setting this trap."
3,functional,not really as out of sight as it advertises. once i set it it looked just as dangerous to my dog as any other mole trap.
2,Difficult to set and use,"This trap does the job, but nearly as well as others I have. THe trap is difficult to set and requires the use of special tools that come with the trap, but are not part of it. Even with the tools this trap is a pain to set compared to others. Once you get is set and placed on an active run it does the job. Another issue I have with this trap is that it's design and color make it difficult to see from a disance and impossible to tell if it is sprung. You have to remeber where you put it and check it periodically. I recommend poking the tools into the ground next to the trap so you will know where they are."
2,Victor Mole Traps - Out of Sight,"These are much more difficult to set and move than the other Victor spear-type models. When ""hunting"" moles, you must move the traps frequently and this Out of Sight version is cumbersome."
2,Mole trP,It arrived on time with out any problems. The only problem is my sister (who purchased it) and her neighbor could not get it to work.
5,Looking forward to using.,"I'm looking forward to using this trap on a illusive mole that I just can't kill. I haveuse repellants, poisoned peanuts and a spike trap by Sweeney that was worthless.....so I put my trust into the reviews here and to the youtube videos on this trap......I'll post an updated review soon."
4,Woodstream Mole Trap,Product is as advertised. Only objection is that it takes strong hands and above average caution to set the traps.
1,Worthless!,"Could never set it. Two strong men needed tools to even spread the jaws, & we couldn't manage to make it stay set. Sitting in a corner gathering dust while the moles are tearing up my yard!"
2,No luck yet,"I bought 5 of these traps hoping to rid myself of the moles in my yard. First off, they are difficult to set. It requires some strength in order to set the trap. So far, the moles simply seem to avoid the trap. One was triggered but the mole avoided the trap somehow. I haven't caught a thing; I'd try a different trap next time."
3,Mole Trapper,"I'm not sure why they call this the ""out-O'site mole trap"". Although the actual mechanism that traps the mole is under ground, the top part (about 4 to 5 inches) still is above the ground. I recommend that you cover it with a small plastic pail or flower pot, so other animals or kids don't set it off inadvertently. So, far I haven't trapped a mole, but I think it's because I haven't set is in an area that the moles are currently active in.Victor 0631 Out O'Sight Mole Trap"
5,"One little booger down, God knows how many more left!","This is the first trap that has worked for us.....EVER! Our neighbor's fiancé works for a critter control company in town. He brought two of these traps over and within two hours of setting them we caught our first mole!Our yard has been terrorized by these beasts and we have tried many things: different traps, poison pellets.....even our Airedale Terrier. She's really good at digging huge holes in the yard....but not actually catching anything.As one reviewer wrote, ""You are looking for long straight runs. Long straight runs are like mole highways. The curvy short runs are hunting roads. The curvy runs are less traveled. Hunt the highways."" This is so true! Listen to his advice and you can't go wrong.UPDATE - 6-25-09 - Four moles in less than a month. And that's only because we haven't been too diligent in resetting them."
2,"dangerous, doesn't work","very hard to set, you could loose fingers if your not careful. triggering mechanism is hard to set and make it stay and takes way too much pressure to spring the trap. placed as instructed, moles just tunnel around it.you have to disturb the ground too much to be able to set it. was excited about getting them, but very disappointed in results.have not caught a single mole and they continue to make swiss cheese out of my yard."
5,Don't waste your time looking anywhere else GO AMAZON.com,"I looked at 3 different home improvement warehouses, a couple of large brick and mortar retailers and one specialty grill company before I found this replacement part on AMAZON.com. The grill I have is just a year old but somewhere, we seemed to have misplaced the original charcoal grate. Granted, the whole grill is only [money], but why spend [money] on a new one when this replacement grate is only [money]? Check out Amazon first and you might just save yourself from running all over the city looking for the replacement part that you'll never find."
5,Flimsy Packaging,"It gets the job done but it arrived in flimsy cardboard packaging that did not adequately cover the grate, which would have allowed it to break had it not been made of metal."
2,doesn't flow well,"I enjoy reading to my children. This book just doesn't rhyme or flow well. My son likes it somewhat, but I prefer something more fun to read. I feel bored reading this one. The ""look inside"" was deceiving, as the one page sounded good, but the book just doesn't flow. Liked the illustrations."
5,GREAT FOR BUILDING DESIGN,I love building design and this calculator simplifies calculations especially those using fractions of inches. It has a wonderful spiral bound pocket sized guide.
3,mm conversion beware,"I have several calculators from this company and they have always worked perfectly. I purchased the desktop version and while it works well, it is missing a dedicated mm button for conversion which is the primary reason I bought it. Display is large and very readable."
5,Great Desktop Tool,"I bought this desktop model for the home, after buying and using the Construction Master Pro Trig hand held calculator. The desktop model makes a great companion to the Pro Trig, which I use in the field for pipe fitting and rigging applications. Both of these products were some of the best purchases I have made, as they are very versatile and offer the most funtions that I use on a day to day basis. Before now, I have either been forced to use more than one calculating device, or keep a list of the frequently used mathmatical formulas on hand to complete my work. Now I am able to work with more speed and accuracy. The set up features are an asset, as I am able to program most of the functions to meet my specific needs. Again great product. It offers more bang for the buck than any other calculating device I have tried. I am a true believer in Calculated Industry products."
5,Construction Master Pro Desk Top,"This Calculator was a Replacement for my son-in-law. It was a Request. He is a Contractor, and has been using the Construction Master Pro for years. It works Great for Him and is his Calculator of Choice."
1,This album...,"Sucks... being a die-hard fan is one thing, but being objective is what's needed here. If this album was so awesome, why not released in the U.S.? It's where the big money is made if this album goes anywhere."
5,Finally the voice is back!,"I've been waiting for this to come! It's like ""candy to my ears"" to hear Coverdale really sing the way only he can. The first track Don't Fade Away is a majestic melodic rock-blues-ballad that truly shows his powerful, at the same time sensitive, voice. A truly great opening. All In The Name of Love, with great guitarwork from Adrian Vandenberg, has a lot of Hendrix-spirit in it. In all, this album has everything that the other late Whitesnake albums were lacking; strong melodies, superb singing. It really seems honest. Tomas Lange"
5,Mesmorizing,Never before has spirituality and psychology been so compatible and accessible. This book has opened my eyes and has allowed me to find new meaning in my life. This is truly one of the most important books I have ever read. Those who read this extraordinary book will never forget Dr. Miller.
1,Piece of junk,I expected this item to be sub par compared to the OEM item but it was total junk. The cable and pulley system broke the first time I tried it so I had to uninstall the whole system. I returned it for a refund and went down to the local autoparts store to buy a good window regulator for $99. What a difference in build quality! It was completely worth the extra money to buy a good product because you don't want to have to replace this more than once.
3,hose washers,These washers are the same as any other hose washers I've used. They eliminate leaks at connections which is what they are designed to do.
5,Works well with Gilmour hoses and products,Pros:- Works well with Gilmour hose.- Stops the leaks at the faucet.Cons:- May not work with all the hoses.
5,Gilmour Washers,Must have washers for your hose and attachments as they all eventually begin to degrade. Nice pack of seemingly quality washers for a good price.
4,They do as a washer does,Pros:- work wonderfully: no leak from the garden hose- easy installation- very thickCons:- price: paid $6 for the pack of 10. Seems a little pricey to me.- pack size: 10. I am not running a water theme park - I do not have 10 garden hoses.
4,Hose and Sprinkler Washers,"Great quality, and it is always handy to have a few extras of these if you have a yard, garden or flower bed."
5,Great Late 80's Sleazy Bloozy Gritty Rn'R,"They woulda, coulda, shoulda been a contender back in the day. But as the legends go, they got shafted, drank & drugged themselves to oblivion, lost a coin toss for fame...Whatever, this is a great album with some great songs and worth having if you're into this type of music. Not dated even now in 2012. RIP lead Singer, Bobby Durango...your music will be remembered and enjoyed...later"
2,get real with the Guns N Roses comparrisons,"This is not even close to sounding like or threatening Guns N Roses. This is a basic Bon Jovi sounding faux rasping singer who cant sing sounds like Warbabies, Sweet FA, L.A. Guns, or a hundred other never weres that came out of the Hollywood hairband photocopy machine in the 1980's. First song is a note for note copy of ""La Grange"" with different lyrics. The styles are all over the place, yet this band makes them all suck. Not awful, not good, merely mediocre and easily forgettable. The only song I remember is the one that Rips off LaGrange. Save your money."
3,ATC's point of view - partly,"well written and informative. i thought the book would be more like a viewpoint from ATC's persepctive, but it is actually more from the pilot's perspective -- and THEN what is happening on ATC's side. Interesting tho. It is, keep in mind, published 1989 (and therefore written before that); so all info is a minimum 20 years old. insightful nonetheless."
3,Way over-priced...,"I haven't used this particular shipment yet, but have used this product in the past, I used to purchase it regularly from a 'club' type store. When I saw this, it was several dollars more than I paid for it before, but I assumed the price had simply increased. However, while shopping yesterday at the local (non-member) big-box store, I happened across this product and found that not only does the local grocery carry it now, but ounce for ounce, it was cheaper-- whether in the large 20oz. pkg, or the smaller size packaging. I wish I'd known this, as I'd have gotten several smaller packages for less expense, and would not have to open all the product at once.I do like the product, it's great for seasoning vegetables, adding to salads, or as a quick addition to omelettes; I just don't like being overcharged. I'll buy it at the local grocery next time."
3,Small package,"My bad. Didn't pay attention to the size of the bag before purchasing. Love these crumbled bacon bits as a product but can buy larger bags for about the same cost somewhere else. Product gets 5 star, low rating because of cost/size of bag."
2,Doesn't keep bugs away,"I had three of these units placed throughout a 600 square foot apartment (ground floor). Unfortunately, I had to squish a spider, silverfish, or unidentified bug almost every other day (in the summer). Sometimes, I fould find a bug just hanging out directly under the pest repeller! I did not notice a decrease in bugs at all.I can't say if this product repels mice or not. I never saw a mouse in my apartment before or after I started using the repellers."
1,Didn't meet my hopes/expectations,"I bought several of these, primarily to deal with a large population of spiders in my finished basement. Unfortunately, they didn't seem to have any noticeable effect. In fact, I saw one spider set up a new home and spun a web for itself just 3 feet from one unit in operation. After 3 months of continuous use, they just didn't seem to have any impact. Overall, a disappointment."
3,Range is exaggerated,"I have had my Weitech 0180-B for years now. The plastic casing really does stand up to wear. This thing has survived several moves now. It works great in a small radius around the unit, but it doesn't cover a large area, and the sound waves are very easily impeded by obstructions like the furniture. I have had the most success placing it near points of ingress where there is nothing to interfere with the sound waves, like beside a window, door or drain."
3,bit scary for little ones,"My 4 year old daughter refuses to play the game becasue she is scared of the ""green bogs"". Hopefully she will overcome this and play it later. It is a challenging game and i have kids from 10-4 and all of them likes it if they were not scared of it."
3,"Game is OK, but a little frustrating for 7 yr old","I'm not sure what I think of this game. The graphics are well done, and the game is set up to allow girls to succeed with it; there are no time limits, and errors are self-correcting. But my 7 year old has difficulty with this, and often asks for help with it. It's divided into different princess world that the character your child creates explores. Ariel (The Little Mermaid) is the easiest, followed by Jasmine, Cinderella, and Snow White's world is the hardest. So far my daughter is about half way through Jasmine's world. It's going slowly for her, which may not be a bad thing, because I'm not sure how much replay value this is going to have once she completes it. I'm a bit mixed on my feelings about this game; it's pretty decent for the price, but with the difficulties my daughter is encountering playing it, I'm thinking this might not have been the best choice for her."
2,To Much Story ... Boring,"I was so wanting this to be a game my 3 1/2 year old Princess could enjoy, but she doesn't. There is way to much story and it loses her interest. You go a short ways of actual game play, then you have to listen to 2 minutes of story. I've tried to skip the story line and you can not. You have to sit through the whole story. Maybe I am pushing the wrong sequence of buttons. Then you get 2 minutes of game play then another 2 minutes of story. It didn't hold her interest for very long, she wanted to change dresses after she got frustrated with the actual game play. After a few times of changing dresses she was completely tired of the game. She's moved on to Diego's Adventure and LOVES it!"
3,Princess WII for 4 year old,"I bought this game for my 4 year old after realizing the PC version I had was not compatible with WIN7. Overall, the game is very detailed and challenging. It is hard for her to play by herself because it requires use of the nunchuck. I would have preferred all actions to be through the WII remote. I would recommend this game,as I do believe it is worth the money for the hours enjoyment your child will have exploring the princess worlds."
1,Game not playable,After two times sending the game back we gave up and decided to get a refund instead of an exchange. My granddaughter enjoyed playing it until it stopped and kept shutting down the Wii system. Too bad too because their are not a lot of games for girls.
3,Nice game if you can get one that works,"Despite the reviews, I decided to buy this game for my six year old daughter. She loses interest in all of the sports-related Wii games, so wanted her to have a ""girly"" game just for her. The one that I received from Amazon lived up to the poor reviews about bugs. The nunchuck functions worked, but most of the Wii remote functions wouldn't work. It made it impossible to play and very frustrating. I returned the game to Amazon the next day. I decided to take another chance and bought another of the same game from Toys R Us. The chance paid off and the new game works the way it is supposed to. My daughter really enjoys it and appeals to her girly nature more than the sports games do. I wish it did require a little more physical activity to play the game, but she's happy with it and I'm glad I was able to get one that worked."
3,Fun but not geared for young kids like we had hoped,"We searched and searched for Wii games our 5-year-olds could play and this was one that many people recommended for younger kids. The game itself is very fun for our girls (collecting jewels, completing taks the Princesses give to them, fighting off the little ""trolls"" with their magic wands, etc.) and they ask us to play it often but the problem is that they need our help to play. The regular Wii remote serves as a magic wand while the nunchuck has to be used to walk around. My 5-year-olds can't really figure out the walking part - especially if they are trying to do their magic wand in the other hand at the same time so we have to sit with them and run the nunchuck while they do the magic wand."
4,Fun for one,My 7 year old daughter loves playing this game. I just wish that more than one person could play at a time.
3,Good game for girls,I got this game for my nieces and they loved it. It's definitely a girl's game. It's not too difficult or complicated.
4,my 4-yr old loves this game,My my 4-yr old daughter loves this game. She figured out quickly how to navigate with both the Wii remote and nunchuck controller at the same time. Some of the tasks are still a little bit too difficult but overall they are definitely achievable. A fun game for all little princesses out there.
3,Okay,I bought this for my daughter who is into princess everything. It is kind of hard for her to play she is 4 years old.
4,Pretty Good,"My 3 and 5 year old girls LOVE this game. It is their standard for other games. I personally think it would be a little boring, but that isn't really what matters. The two of them can do it together without my assistance (very often). Seems like we have tried others trying to find something they will like as well...but haven't found it yet. I recommend it all the time to our friends."
4,My little girl loves it!,Although the graphics like all Wii games are not as good as other platforms this is a great game. My 4 year old daughter has been playing this and Dora for hours.
5,Perfect game for a six year old girl,I have seen some of the reviews and the bottom line it is perfect for a 6 year old girl. I will take a long time for her to figure all the stages out unless the dad or mom is constantly helping :-)
3,The game is good,"This is a good game for little princesses. It's just a tad short, my niece completed the game in less than one day."
3,Retread of old Princess game,Sad graphics and the game is for all intents and purposes the same as the last princess title. My almost 6 year old finished it with her 7 year old brother in a single day. Disney should put a little more effort into these princess games.
4,Great game after getting used to it,"Bought this game for my then 5 year old, now 6. We needed to go online to get some hints as to what we were supposed to do and how to do it, but once we figured it out, it all made sense. Now, my 6 and 4 year old play together, either in 2 person mode or one holds the wii remote and the other the nunchuck and they take turns. I would recommend it but be patient at first and if you read the instructions to the kids, they will figure it out faster!"
1,I HATE this game too,"My daughters, ages 4 & 6 both really loved the idea of this game. The outfits and interaction with the princesses are fun, but there are so many bugs that it makes the game unworkable. They are new to the Wii, but even I have a very difficult time getting the pointer to work and as of now we are completely stuck in the mine with the dwarves. Both girls could easily play and enjoy the game if it actually worked. Too bad. I really wanted to like this game."
1,HATE this game!,"Oh, my goodness, I don't have strong enough words for how much I HATE this game! One level makes you click on two dwarves to move them and it won't let you click more than once. However, in order to actually move on with the game, you have to click on each of them multiple times! This leads to very frustrated kids and an even MORE frustrated mother! So we decided to quit and try a different level to see if we could make it work only to find out that one of the players for some reason isn't allowed to go the direction the other one can go. We would push the button to go left multiple times and it would make the player turn right back the other direction. And it's only this game, since we have no problems with any of our other Wii games. This is the most frustrating game I've ever played!"
1,Does Not Work,"I thought my daughter had trouble playing this game cause she was to young (5 years) so I put it away for a year and just tried again. It wasn't her, it's the game!The pointer functions don't work, even to start the game and write her name didn't work. I switched remotes and had the same problem. I took over the game and found it so frustrating, I couldn't imagine a 6-year-old trying to learn this as her first and only video game.I now see this has happened to others and I wanted to add to the list of frustrated parents so you would trust this is a real problem and maybe move on to find another game that actually works."
2,Over too soon,"My daughter got this for her fifth birthday. She'd finished it within a couple of days. It's fun, for sure, but after you play it once, the only fun is changing the princess' look, and even that gets old soon. If you get if for $10 or less, it's worth it."
3,princess game,bit challenging for young children under the age of 5 but entertaining for young princesses.
3,Very fun but doen't have a language change option,"We are from Costa Rica and this game was for my 4 years old girl. She loved the game and it is very fun, I wish I have a language option to change it to spanish. Instead I have to translate for her."
3,ok for little ones,"I mean really little ones. My just turned five year old daughter mastered it within 3 days. So now that the whole game is complete she is thinking of redoing it again with another Mii. Overall, it is an ok game. The plus is it has the princesses and lets the player also act out as a princess. Story lines are easy and not complex. Sometimes it seemed too simple."
4,Hours of entertainment,"This is like a souped up version of game boy game. But the challenges seems to change, which is good. And the images are good."
2,Too short - otherwise good gameplay,"We received this game as a Christmas gift for my 5 year old. She loves Disney Princesses and we had just bought our Wii, so this is one of the first games she played on it. Together, we finished the game in roughly four 30 - 40 minute game sessions. One bonus level that is over in five minutes is available after the game is won. The Wiimote controls for waving the wand were great, but the game creators could have done much more with the unique aspects of the Wii controller. Overall, a very well done game that looks good and smaller girls (I would have trouble recommending to girls younger than 5 and older than 7) can play easily. But, the major problem was its brevity and almost zero replay value. Would not purchase if it were over 20 dollars."
1,Difficult to play and glitchy.,"We are a family of gamers...and we were totally frustrated by this game. Instructions were unclear, and gameplay was difficult and glitchy."
3,A couple disappointed Princesses,bought this for my daughters 8 and 6. they got bored after 5 minutes of playing... my 6 year old wouldn't play by herself since she could not figure out what to do... game made no since and had no direction...
4,A great game for little girs!,"First of all, I cannot believe that this game has so few reviews. So, here I go. My four year old loves this game. As mentioned by others, this game does have a small learning curve, but overall my 4 1/2 year old did fine. Her older sisters helped her the first few plays and now she is fine.My seven year old likes this game as well because she is into princesses and Disney. I would recommend this game for 4 to 6 year old girls in general.My only complaint is that in two-player mode only ONE princess gets to wear the crown. This causes unnecessary envy and arguing, but it is also an opportunity to teach 'sharing' and 'taking-turns.' Overall, this is a good game for this age-group."
3,Lura,"We rented this game along with others to see what we wanted to add to our list for Santa. It was great fun for my 5 yearold who loves Disney Princesses and we just returned from Disney in October but she was dissapointed as was I that after you design your costume and play through Cinderella, Snow White, Ariel and Jasmine to unlock Belle that is the extent of the game. I kept fiddleing with it to see if there was more but no there was not. I would recommend it as a rental but not as a purchase unless the price is 19.99."
3,Mommy & Me Game Play,"We got this for our 4 yo daughter for Christmas. She and I have had so much fun playing together. In 2 player mode, you are helping each other and helping the princesses. My only complaint is that it just isnt long enough. We have already played through the game once. We are certain to start again really soon. I agree that older more game savvy children would get bored easily but small ones will love it."
2,Fun for a princes -- for about a day or so . . .,"My 6-yr-old loves the princess stuff, and she had great fun with this for a day or so. It really is a game for very young girls - its not hard at all. BUT - After you go through all the chapters, there really isn't anything left to do. You can change your princess's dress and walk around in the various princess worlds, but there isn't anything to do. My daughter got totally bored with this game after she had completed all the levels -- which only took her a couple of hours worth of playing time. When you look at some of the sophisticated games out there it is ridiculous to me that they couldn't have made there be things to do after the levels were completed. Even though she loved this game at first, she is now disappointed that there is nothing else to do."
4,Very nice game,"My 4 year old daughter love this game....though she was a little afraid of the bogs at first. After a while, she learned how to beat them and was no longer afraid. My 5.5 year old plays along and helps his sister and they enjoy it. It's a nice game and helps to create a team effort. The goals are not that difficult, and some ""levels"" are harder than others, but the players are told which ones are easier and which ones are more difficult. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the final level was dissapointing. Otherwise, I do recommend this game.....for the ages I mentioned. I think children over 7 or 8 may not like it."
3,Overly complicated controls for 3-4 year olds,"My 3 year old loved the Go Diego Wii games, as the control system really takes advantage of the Wii, and doesn't involve the nunchuk etc. However, moving to this game, she needed alot of help - the control system is really poorly designed, the movement is finnicky, and the puzzles are overly obscure. It's a shame, the whole princess thing is great for little girls, but for a great kids game I have to recommend the Go Diego games."
3,Super Easy & Super Fast,"I bought this for my little sister, an 8 year old, and she enjoyed it but she played it for less than 8 hrs and beat the whole game! The reason for this? The little princess can NEVER die, the game is not timed and it is super easy! Each chapter takes about 15 minutes to finish and the bogs(the creatures u have to kill) die in one magic trick! Like I said, she enjoyed the game but it is not worth [...]... for [...], it should've lasted a like 2 weeks... this game is worth $10, only because the graphics are nice but WAY too easy for an 8 yr old."
3,OK Game for young kids.,This game is slow to load and does not hold the attention of my child very long. She still likes the Princess themem but the game is does not have much action.
3,A little difficult,"My daughters were so excited to play this game. They love choosing the princess outfits at game start. They spend so much time doing that, they run out of playtime! They found it very difficult to defeat the bogs. Their father had to show them how and they kind-of get it now. Each level is a little more of the same. In the end, you just unlock all the outfits and there is not much more to it. It has Disney Princesses though, so if your princess loves Disney, it will be a winner. Just be prepared to walk her through the game and be there when she gets frustrated."
3,"Fun, but gets old fast","I bought this game for my 5 year old daughter. She loves disney princesses and thought this was the perfect game for her. She really enjoyed playing with it, but in about 3 days she had it completely beat and doesn't care to use it anymore. I think it is a great game, but only if your child likes to play things over and over again. otherwise, not worth the money.."
4,nice game,"I bought this game for my five year old daughter for Christmas. It has been a big hit. I think the most fun part for her is changing her characters clothes, shoes, and jewelry."
3,It's Okay,"I bought this for my little cousin so whenever she comes over my house she can play. There's a one player and two player option. The two player option just lets you do the same things twice, like say if you were to collect falling bubbles (in Ariel's World), player one goes first and then player two does the same thing. I think it would be more fun if it player one and two were more interactive.My little cousin liked the game but she did have trouble with navigating using the wiimote and nunchunks. You HAVE to use both. At one point she was stuck trying to get Sebastian's crab friends and we just restarted the game after trying for 15 mins. It's an alright game but I wouldn't spend that much money on it. It's fun for a while, but the fascination and fun slowly dried up."
3,Too hard for a preschooler,"I bought this for my 4 1/2 year old daughter. She and her friends (4 & 5yr olds) liked the idea and wanted to play, but it was way to difficult for them to figure out. They were able to play for sometime with an adult coaching them along. But the slow action didn't keep their attention for more than 20 minutes."
4,good for young girls under 6,My four year old loved this game and eventually managed to use the controls herself. It is difficult at first because it needs the use of both hands. Great graphics! I rated it four stars because of the trouble we went thru trying to unlock Belle. Why put something with secret codes on a game for young children who are unable to search internet to find the answers.
2,Rent...don't buy!,"My 5 year old finished this game (by herself) in 3 days. Not a great value and she was very disappointed that it was over so fast. That said, it's stunning visually and very engaging. The princesses are perfect; you can't get a better princess fix unless you go to Disney World, which is much more expensive! My recommendation would be to rent the game if you have a child who will be playing the game themselves. If you're going to be playing it over time with a younger child (as in you will be at the controls) then it COULD be worth it to buy it. Just be aware that expectations should be low as to the lenght of the experience."
1,Waste of money,"DON'T BUY IT or YOU WILL BE REGRET. Need I say more? I wish I can return now, but there is no return on media products."
1,Horrible,"This game was horrible.The ""bogs""/scarey guys were ugly, they scared my 6 year old. The graphics weren't that great and you do the same thing over and over in the whole game!My daughter wanted to play it, but made me do pretty much everything because she was scared of the ugly little bogs.I'm glad we just rented this instead of buying, im surprised Disney didn't take the time to come up with a better game than this!"
2,Much too expensive and it should be rated Everyone 6+,"Our 3.5 year old daughter picked this out as her Christmas gift from Grandpa and Oma. Little did I realize my wife and I would have to play most of it for her. There are LONG sections where the player has to listen to background information and directions from a pixie -- in which our daughter quickly lost interest.Also, the game requires the player to direct the character's movements with the nunchuck and use the remote as her magic wand. Again, beyond our daughter's interest and skill level.She was extremely upset that she couldn't visit Belle, even after winning the game. (We recently discovered that you have to enter the secret code GASTON.)It took us 4, maybe 5 sessions to win the game (we did a chapter or two per night, based on our daughter's attention span), and haven't played it since. There's not a lot of incentive to play it again."
3,a good game for my 3 year old,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter (she'll be 4 in April) who loves anything princess. She get a little frustrated with the controls at times but over all she loves this game. She's happy that it's a game her older brother is NOT interested in and is truly all hers. She has not beat it, she gets too distracted and would rather just run around all the worlds twirling her wand (if you get the game you'll understand!). She's played it several days in a row for about 30 minutes at a time and hasn't bored of it yet.The graphics are cute and good for a kids game and music can get a little annoying but I find that's sort of normal for anything."
1,Enchanted Journey is full of bugs! Do not buy.,"Purchased this game for my 6 year old daughter after reading all the wonderful reviews. Game is cute and fairly easy, but it is full of bugs. Everytime we get to a part in the story line that has a mini game, we have to reset the game and start again. The pointer function of the wiimote will not work for the mini-games. I did an online search and found that we are not the only ones who have a flawed game, this problem seems to be fairly common. I definitely would not purchase this game again. Hopefully if you decide to purchase one anyway, your game will not be flawed like ours is."
2,Great for Little Ones.... Except for the Bugs!,"My 4 year old loves this game, but it's got some serios problems that My 4 year old loves this game, but it's got some serious problems that prevent her from being able to play it without assistance. The most notably is the fact that if you have to use the Wii remote as a pointer it only works well if you are VERY close (with in 4 ft) of the sensor bar.This is not the case with any other Wii game that we have. This ""bug"" requires an adult to complete various tasks simply because the game's pointer is so finicky."
2,too short,Daughter loved the game but finished it in a couple of hours. Would not recommend buying. Rent it. It is fun but way too short.
5,Great fun,"This game was perfect for girls 5 to 7, definitely recommend. Great price and fast shipping."
4,Very nice,"My daughter enjoy it very much, the grafics are so real and the sounds males it incredible, i recomend it."
2,Way too expensive for what you get...,"I bought this game for my 7 and 8 year old daughters, who love the Disney Princesses.Neither of them are expert video game players and generally prefer sim-like games such as Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing. They loved the game play of Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey but it was over within 2 1/2 hours...and part of that included customizing their character before the game started.For $20 it might have seemed like a good purchase, but at twice the price it is a disappointment.Essentially, it would be a good game for very young children who have short attention spans, but any older than 5 or 6 and it's just not worth it.Hopefully Disney Friends for DS will provide more replay value."
4,Very good and fun,"My six year old daughter really likes this game. I can see why some of the reviewers state they get stuck in some places, but if you just take about 3 minutes (literally - 3 minutes) and walk around you'll figure it out. Of course, one could also look at the instruction manual or online for help. Overall, this is a very entertaining, fun, and challenging but not too challenging/easy but not too easy Wii game."
3,Decent (I guess),"I bought this game for Christmas for my 4 year old daughter, and it is just too advanced for her. Now granted it is my fault for not doing proper research into the control scheme, but having to use the nunchuck to walk and the wiimote to point, was just too much for her right now.That being said, she enjoyed the game a lot. I ""drove"" the nunchuck to walk around and she used the wiimote to cast spells, etc. However, it was pretty short and I don't think the replayability will be very high."
3,Fun but too short!,"That's IT?? Really? There's no more to the game? Wow. Got this for my daughter's 6th birthday, and 2 days later, she's finished with it. Okay, so she was playing with her 9-yr old brother which surely made it go faster, but still.Three stars just because she LOVED interacting with the princesses, and that *might* make it worth playing again from the start (we will see...) The ending is kind of a letdown - my daughter was mad that nothing exciting happened (no new jewels for necklace or anything) after she played the one game in Belle's world.Hmm. Could have been done much better..."
1,Shame on Levine...,NO way would I EVER buy ANY opera in anything other than its original language. How could Maestro Levine ruin a masterpiece by performing it in English???? Stay away.
5,great,got video fast and dispite what some ppl said mine was not damaged and i live in oregon and it was shipped from new jersey.
3,Why so pricey?,"The HD DVD of the 2006 performaance is about 10 times (Amazon $119.00 for the HD version vs.$12.99 for the plain DVD) the price of the ""older"" one, which seems to have the same cast, performance dates, and even cover to the DVD. Is the HD really worth this huge price increase?"
2,Love this production...now where is the full German edition,"Julie Taymor's production is a delicious treat. I saw the full German version of this production the year it debuted and it was amazing. Unfortunately, the MET has only released their holiday version in English (this item). I taped the PBS broadcast of the full-opera in German and have it saved on my DVR, but I'd like to have it on DVD. It is the only reason I'm giving it two-stars because I'm hoping someone over that the MET will see this and consider putting it out..."
5,Gotcha!,This trap was easy to operate and worked as expected. We caught all manner of vermin and were happy with the results.
5,Caught two Racoons in the last two weeks,We caught two Racoons that had been chewing through our neighbors screen porch and walking along our fence line.They were also causing problems with our dogs and some stray cats in the area.We simply relocated them unharmed to a rural area.
5,Trap worked perfectly,The only thing I would add to this would be a little tray affixed to the back center of the trap so the animal would have to enter and would not be able to grab the bait and move it out through the side or back. We punched holes in a small tuna can and attached it to the bottom with wire and it worked successfully.
5,Great for beginners,"Great trap for people who have never trapped before. Having a skunk problem and this trap worked great, extremely easy to set and release from. Was worried the animals might get out, they never did and the trap didn't hurt them at all. Highly recommended for ease of use and functionality."
5,We got him!!,"East set up. On the second day, the menace raccoon was caught on our deck, and is now relocated. As compared to a rental charge of $10 per day ($30/week), this purchase price is reasonable. Now we need to get his mate."
5,Wow... great product,"I had not idea how many raccoons, possums, and stray cats were lurking around my back yard, and my outdoor aviaries full of exotic parrots until I set this out. I literally quite putting bait in it because I caught something every night... I got tired of ""relocating"" the pests, so I temporarily stopped setting it. Very effective and durable."
2,Not real happy,"I was using this to catch raccoons in the garden. The first 3 or 4 nights, they triggered the trap and flipped it over. The bait was all gone. After doing some reading, I put a cement block on top of the cage and one on each side toward the back, then another against the back of the cage. The trap worked fine from then on. I caught a coon each of the next two nights. You do have to be careful about getting the bait back toward the far end of the cage. I used a piece of lunch meat."
3,not for me,"i am sure it works, but the professional style door was not comfortable. it was too complicated to set and release. also felt that my fingers were exposed to the inside.I bought the havahart easy set door and it is easy to set. however it is much more expensive.. seems the professional should cost more than the simpler one."
1,Not in the Cards,"Purchased this in the hopes of capturing a woodchuck which is wreaking havoc in my flower beds. While the trap appears to be well constructed, it has proven totally ineffective. In the past 2 weeks I have tried broccoli spears, marshmallows, lettuce and finally cantaloupe as recommended by Havahart. Nothing has worked. At one point the woodchuck sat up and rested his paws on the trap & sauntered away. A complete waste of money!"
4,Single Door Havahart Trap,"Purchased this for a birthday present for my dad, who currently has been using a double-door trap. We were pleased at the ease of setting the trap. We will have to wait for spring and summer to put it to test, but are optimistic that it will do the job. Product seems sturdy."
2,Latch unreliable,"This trap is sturdy for large raccoons, opossoms IF the trap mechanism is working correctly that day. A former rater commented that he had to bend the wire. That's where the problem is."
2,not that great!,"I've been using this type of trap for 4 years and got news for everyone - it does not work all the way. Since the animal gets trapped in the middle of the night it has plenty of time to get out. The wire U-loop reinforcing the trap door simply bends and the animal of opossum size gets out by the morning. It was very frustrating 3 times in a row - it traps the animal but can't keep it inside.So I added the trap door switch with the buzzer left inside the house - worked right away! 4 AM in the morning the opossium was inside! Still needed to put the metal bar to fix the trap door so it does not escape.This night the buzzer went off but the animal escaped since the hook on the top of the cage no longer catch the U-loop - the trap is getting old, time to waste more money on another one."
1,poor listing,"This listing is unlikely to sell many traps, since it does not show the size of the trap or the species of animal it is intended to catch!"
1,The trap doesn't shut all the way!,This product is useless! The lock doesn't spring shut all the way. It fails most of the time. DONT BUY THIS!!!
3,Livetrap for raccoons?,"This is a great trap, but rather small for raccoons. I bought two sizes, and the larger size has caught several raccoons, but I haven't caught one in this trap. We set them both at the same time. Still, the havahart trap is a quality, well-built trap."
4,It Works,I bought this to catch feral cats which have been lurking around my property and relieving themselves on my lawn and gardens. All I've caught is an opossum. I think I should have purchased a double opened end version as I believe the cats are fearful of the closed end of the trap. The opossum was not injured in the capture process which is an important feature.
5,Works like a charm!!,I can't believe how wonderfully this works. We put the trap out on two different evenings and caught a culprit each night. It works great and safely captures the little guy without harming them. Perfect for those of us who don't want to harm or injure but simply remove.
3,Havahart Live Trap,The trap is made from lighter weight materials than an older one I borrowed from a neighbor. I had to straighten the trigger plate after a large raccoon bent it while in the trap. It is functional and does the job intended though.
1,Not constructed well,"This is a very poorly built coon trap. The handle should be more heavy duty. A large coon is hard to carry any distance. But the thing that is the worst is the distance between the wire. A coon can reach his paw thru the wire some 6 to 8 inches. Don't say you should wear gloves because I do. Bottom line, I would not purchase another one. Thanks Ray......"
1,Havahart 1079,"I had a great problem with ground hogs eating my garden. This product did not catch a single one, but one I bought at Ace Hardware for half the price caught eight ground hogs, three opossums, and a skunk. This product does not work! I have been catching them for years and taking them out into the ""boonies"" and releasing them in the woods away from gardens. This product did not catch anything."
5,Havahart 1079!,"FAST and FREE shipping, and the BEST PRICE around! Caught that male Tom cat that was beating up my cats...almost $600 in Vet bills..........Used it one time, that Tom isn't so smart, released him at the ....can't tell, but he's HAPPY eating mice, sleeps in the hay and now his FOES are the hooves of Horses!We donated the Havahart to our local Animal Shelter for others in need of a HAVAHART TRAP!"
1,Pictures included above - 1st night of use it started coming apart,"I have had a racoon problem for years. I decided to buy a cage and chose this model. I received it yesterday and took it out of the box last night about 9:00pm. This morning I found a juvenile racoon in there. He had somehow removed the handle (pictures of destruction are on description), though there is a guard around it. He had also bent some of the wires on the cage. Needless to say I am returning it. This is extremely cheaply made.PETA people: I let the racoon go in a field near my work after he feasted in my garbage can."
1,"Work well, racoon destroyed after one use","The trap worked well. Caught a racoon within 3 hours of setting it out, that was about midnight. By the time we were able to check out the trap the next morning, the racoon had destroyed the flimsy trip mechanism. So for a single use trap, it was great. Awfully expensive for that one use."
5,Perfect for feral cats and kittens,"We have trapped about 18 feral cats and kittens with this trap. It helps to have more than one trap, as it goes quicker. I get sentimental about the kittens, but if we trap them when small they have an excellent chance of being adopted. It is hard to do emotionally, but this trap works really well, and if you put a towel inside and have one ready to put over the top, you can then take them to be fixed and then bring back to release or take them to a shelter for adoption."
4,Great product,Works great. I caught a ground hog on purpose and a raccoon on accident with the trap. The trap was sturdy enough the animals could not damage the trap or escape. I just think it was overpriced.
4,dog rescued,"first off it came assembled, thankssecondly it worked well so far in 2 useswe caught a Chihuahua and got it adopted, fantastic, could not have been done without this traponly downside is the release door, you have to do 3 simultaneous steps to release the animal and if puts you at slight risk, NEED A EASY RELEASE MECHANISM OF SECOND DOOR"
5,I love the little critters--just far away,"I found that for the price a 'professional' pest controller visit, I could buy my own trap to use whenever I needed. The Havahart 1079 was selected after reading so many positive reviews. Very easy to use, well constructed, was able to trap my offending raccoon the 2nd night (first night with bait--small can of cheap cat food). I twist-tied thru the pull tab (partially opened) to the top of the cage over the step plate. Released him a few miles away into a corn field--he never looked back."
5,Very satisfied with this trap,This is the perfect size for catching the large raccoons and woodchucks eating inside our fenced garden. Having only one door assures that an animal has to enter far enough into the trap for the door to close. So far the trap has caught an animal each day.
4,It is o.k.,"I believe this will fill the bill for large racoons and skunks. It was a little lighter in gauge than I thought it would be, but I suppose that is going to be o.k. It is not as heavily built as some other traps I have used. The trap linkage appears to be alright and will not be a problem."
4,Nice trap,"Trap seems well made and is easy to operate. Since I've been trying, unsuccessfully, to trap an armadillo for over a month now, I can't really comment on how well it works."
5,Good trap,"Works good, racoons fit well, prarie dogs kind of jump over the trap spring, so they need a little container to slow them down"
2,Design is good but quality is not!,"I bought this trying to catch an armadillo however due to the construction, the armadillo was able to escape. I like that it was easy to set up, but I will try the non-collpasible version to see if it fares any better."
1,Don't Waste Your Money...,"I purchased this as a ""stocking stuffer"" for my son, thinking it would be a fun, novelty toy.As soon as it arrived, I knew I made a mistake. It was smaller than expected and cheaply made. Even the package cautions users not to play too hard so the tail does not break off! This item is nothing more than a rubber ball with a foam tail stapled on to it...As for tricks? We could not get it to do any.A total disappointment. I would return it, but the postage will cost 50% of my purchase price.Don't waste your money..."
1,Not a good hole puncher! :(,"I bought 8 hole punches for a school project for my classroom. I think that I had four different kinds, two that I picked up here and three other kinds from office supply stores, Target and Wal-Mart. These two Swingline (which I thought would be great since I love the staplers) were the worst of the bunch and the most expensive!) Two that I got for under a dollar at another place worked at least twice as well. The others cost me either 1.50 or $2 each. One of the hole punches worked for a little while and then wouldn't work any more at all and the other worked but only kind of and was very hard to use. I wouldn't buy these again! I wish that there had been reviews before I purchased these back in October!!!"
1,Broken,This broke after one use on a piece of lightweight card-stock. I would not recommend this product. I have had much better luck with the Fiskars bran punches.
2,"No really, it doesn't punch holes very well","I thought the other reviewers were just mad or didn't know how to use a hole punch. Nope, it just doesn't do a very good job. After messing around with it, if you do the max number of 5 pages it works the best. Anything more and it gives up, anything less and it won't punch an entire hole. Why does it work this way, who knows but that's how it is. Thankfully I only needed it for a small hobby project and nothing serious."
2,doesn't worth the money,"Bought this to organize my paperwork. Won't work with more than two sheets,which was ok with me even though it is more time consuming.Than I went to a local store and found out that I overpaid almost 4 times the amount it cost :(Well.... live and learn.I ended up buying a three hole puncher which works just fine on 5 sheets and cost almost the same."
5,Get the book. You'll love it!,"I'm 14, and I read 'Sybil' when I was 12. I also saw the movie that year. I loved it! I couldn't put it down, and I read it 5 more times that year. I felt like I knew all 16 of Sybil's personalities, like Vicky and Peggy Lou. It really got me into multiple personality, and helped me decided to become a psychiatrist one day."
4,I remember where i was the first time,The first time I read this was after the television movie aired- I have gone back to this book several times in my life for support and understanding. having actually lived with a person with MPD there was no internet then and this book and the therapist held HER together as well as me.Some day I will tell OUR story and how SHE surviving abuse helped me survive everyday life and see the world differently.Havent read another book on the subject as indepth or acurate.
5,Sticks with you...,"I first read this in 1974 when it came out in paperback. I was like 12... (parents didn't edit my reading material, only the movies. lol) Riveting. Graphic. And at the time, nothing like it had been published before. Probably one of the reasons hypnosis began fascinating me, even then."
5,Heartbreaking and Amazing!,"I was simply blown away by this novel. It was deeply disturbing to read about the abuse that Sybil suffered at the hands of her mother. However, it was fascinating to read about how her mind had tried to protect her from the abuse by splintering into 16 other personalities.I am not sure I would recommend this novel to anyone who comes from an abusive background. I have childhood abuse in my background and it was very hard for me to read portions of this novel. That would be my only hesitation in recommending this novel. It is truly amazing to read!"
5,A powerful work everyone should read!,"My sister read this book for a college psychology class when I was around 8 or 9 and I remember her speaking of it incredulously. I finally read it when I was a bit older, and became so fascinated by the case of Sybil and her inner struggle for self-discovery. The film version with Sally Field was brilliant! I have read and re-read this book, endlessly engrossed with the whole issue of multiple personality and the sad, frightening reality of child abuse. Sybil is such a courageous, yet tragic person. I was saddened to hear of her death, but believe by coming forward during her frightening ordeal she has helped many of others struggling with a similar situation. In a class by itself. See the movie too!"
1,Thoroughly discredited,"This book has been thoroughly discredited and should be read only as a cautionary tale of how psychiatry and journalism can manufacture a story from whole cloth, taking advantage of a woman who very well may have been mentally ill, while profiting mightly from the results. This ""author"" made a fortune from this lie. Shame, shame! Read ""Sybil Exposed"" instead."
5,"tragic, yet beautiful","What an amazing journey I encountered with ""Sybil"". I chose the text for a study trilogy and wow, what a knockout it was. It is almost impossible to believe it were real, but that is the beauty of it, you know that Sybil lived this horrific tale and still came out of it scarred but happy. An inspiration, I hated finishing the book, I wanted to endure Sybil's life for a lot longer. Schreiber has done a wonderful job to bring this text to life, in a sensitive and moving fashion. Cheers, Sybil you give me inspiration and hope!"
1,Sybil--a work of fiction,"Although most of the reviews here praise this book, it has been largely discredited as essentially a piece of fiction. Our cultural preoccupation with ""multiple personality disorders,"" ""recovered memories of childhood abuse,"" and ""Satanic cult abuse of children"" is analogous to the Salem witch trails. A reader who wishes to see a clear and compelling refutation of this nonsense should read Dr. Paul McHugh's study ""Try to Remember: Psychiatry's Clash Over Meaning, Memory, and Mind."" McHugh is a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins. The reason this is important: many lives have been wrecked as a result of false claims of childhood abuse."
1,A Piece of Fiction,"I read the book and saw the television movie years ago and just assumed its veracity. Having recently read ""Sybil Exposed"" by Debbie Nathan, I have come to believe that it is not true."
2,"Uninteresting, Fraudulent","Sybil is Flora Rheta Schreiber's fictional account about a young woman afflicted with sixteen different personalities. If you are looking for a truthful, thought-provoking work this is not for you. It has been revealed since the book's first publication that the story presented within these pages is a fraud cooked up by the three main characters. For the real story Sybil Exposed is a much better read.But even if we disregard this as a work of nonfiction and accept it as what it is - a nearly 500 page novel - it still is not very exciting or interesting. Schreiber displays a neat, detailed prose but none of the characters are written in a way that I felt excited to begin reading anew each day. This book was a chore to finish - it felt too long and too full of unnecessary details. It's too bad this book is still marketed as ""the classic true story"" rather than the fictional account it really is."
1,Exposed...,"This book was exposed... several years ago, after a researcher tracked down the real ""Sybil"". The author made up the sensational facts to fit her own odd theories, and sold a lot of books in the process. The real girl's ""symptoms"" were invented by her therapist, and she nver actually had most of the experiences detailed in the book. See Newsweek (January 25, 1999, where Peter M. Swales discusses the people and issues behind the book"
5,Haunting and Wonderful,"Whether you are fascinated with Multiple Personality Disorder, like I am, or you have little knowledge of the subject, you will love this book. It is a true account of a woman tortured by 16 different personalities. Schreiber really helps you understand how this woman feels and why the disorder showed itself in the first place. Amazing book."
5,Profoundly distrurbing,"I'm a 28 year old female from South Africa. I read this book about 7 years ago. This book was so disturbing at one point that I wasn't going to continue reading it, however, I could not sleep because of nightmares recollecting her experiences so I had to continue along the book to her recovery so that I could see hope for her. The book helps us identify with at least some of what it must feel like to have MPD and takes you on an incredible journey, one that you're likely never to forget. I'm sorry to hear she died, I've always wanted to tell her how brave I thought she was."
1,Book is a fraud.,"This book is fiction. In her well researched and well written book, SYBIL EXPOSED, Debbie Nathan reveals the truth about Sybil. You will learn far more reading SYBIL EXPOSED, than reading SYBIL."
2,Sybil,"I think that if you read this book believing it to be the true story that it claims to be, it is so heart wrenching and powerful, that it would no doubt be reviewed as a well deserved 4 or 5 star book. HOWEVER, finding out after the fact that it is actually in large part fictional, it loses ALOT of its power. Speaking for myself, it would have been better to simply publish it as a novel. I read it twice. Once, years ago when it was still believed to be true, and it had much more of an impact on me then. The second time it sort of left me feeling duped. In any case, Sally Field was wonderful in the movie adaptation. (This was the Million Little Pieces of the 70's.)"
2,For some parts,"Dr. Wilbur writes this book as a doctor trying to be a writer which made me constantly aware of who was writing rather than what was being written. The most interesting parts of the book were details about Sybil's past (which were, at times, compelling) whereas the details about methods and therapy were just boring. Maybe it's just hard to try to write a interesting work and remain professional at the same time, but I think someone else could have written this much better."
2,Waited and Waited,"My daughter needed the book for a psych class. The public library had several holds on the book. It took weeks to get the book, and amazingly the library came through with the book faster.I realize you have to wait longer with standard shipping, but I never had to wait so long for something that wasn't on back order."
1,Rhino has no respect for 80s horror,"I was totally disgusted with rhino,s version of Don,t answer the phone.All the great parts are butchered beyond belief.The violence was watered down to nothing and all you are left with are a bunch of talky parts.The reason people buy a film like this is for those exciting segments.Without that you have nothing.First of all we pay money for these products so they should not be edited.This version was like a bad tv movie.We should all get our money back from being ripped off like that.My advice is to wait until a reputable company releases this film UNCUT,and gives it the respect it deserves."
1,Don't bother with this version!,"Rhino has totally butchered this old exploitation/drive in flick --do NOT buy this version. The only reason to watch this movie was to see sex and violence; all nudity and graphic violence has been edited out on this version. It has been so badly butchered it would not get an ""R"" rating if submitted as presented on this DVD.Shame on Rhino, you people are obviously very sick."
1,Blec-c-c-h! What a Waste of Time and Money!,"This DVD is rated R, but should be rated PG. All sex and violence has pretty much been slashed. The original movie has one of the all-time great, or should I say outrageous, serial killers in Nicholas Worth, but his efforts are lost in this major disappointment. The violence is tempered by some, shall we say, sick humor. Not much else is left. I rated this DVD a 1, but only because that is the lowest rating available. DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!"
1,Totally Worthless,"The DVD version of this movie which I just received, is totally worthless. It has had ALL the intense scenes removed. I thought the $11.88 was a low price, well it ain't even worth $0.88. DON'T BUY IT, ITS RATED ""G"" FOR GONE!"
1,EXTREMELY censored ripoff DVD,"Amazon should allow us to rate something as a zero, 'cause this one is.Wow. I just received ""Don't Answer the Phone"", a cheap strangler movie that, nonetheless, had some pretty gorgeous women in panties and nothing else during various lead-ups to murder scenes.Don't even THINK of buying this. Rhino should be charged with larceny for releasing this Jerry Falwell pablum. The DVD's crudely-hacked version cuts out entire scenes and even entire murder victims. The little that is shown is TV-spineless close-ups of nothing.Is this typical Rhino? I'll avoid these creeps forever if so. How can someone even release garbage like this?Entertainment laws need to be enacted that force loud disclaimers on the covers of badly-hacked DVD versions of anything.I'm returning mine. Thieves."
4,Make sure to get the right version of this film,"This film has a bit of everything, cheese, sickness, violence, nudity, humor. If you are looking for gore, you will be disappointed. Kirk Smith is a creepy dude and James Westmoreland plays this one spot one. For a B-Side horror film this is one to check out just for the performance James Westmoreland gives."
3,Don't Forget The Beer!...,"DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE! is another Crown International production meant to lure patrons into the drive-ins of its day (late 70s / early 80s). As with other CI films, there is a repugnant killer (Nicholas Worth), a half-baked plot, and a bus-load of topless babes. Please, keep in mind that this movie was made to be seen (on and off) from the back seat of a steamy car! Not to mention the fact that some level of inebriation is critical to the viewing experience! Is DATP! a stunning masterpiece? Of course not. However, it is a typical drive-in film, created for the sole purpose of filling those gravel lots w/ paying customers. Ah, the memories..."
1,Total Garbage,"Without question, the worst film I have ever seen. The direction, story, acting, and score are all done with no talent whatsoever. Not even worth viewing for ""camp"" value, unless you find themes of rape, torture, misogyny, murder, and racism to be funny.Apparently, this new VHS and DVD version from Rhino edits out all the graphic sex and violence, which was the only reason to watch this trash in the first place. Why did Rhino think that this excrement was worth rereleasing in the first place, especially in a heavily edited version?Too bad giving the film zero stars is not an option."
3,Don't answer the phone,"I don't like violence, its a movie that i would not recommend for children to watch.Thank-you for the movie."
5,The true masterpiece,"As you hear to this music, you will enjoy one of the most singular and beautiful musical experiences one can ever have. Egberto Gismontis' sincerity, and his sense of touch, rhythm and musical spirit goes far beyond any standard, and reaches a realm of freedom and beauty that truly enhances our cultural condition, remaining as ""a thing of beauty"", sublime and lasting forever. Alone or in the context of his whole work, this recording expresses one of the most original musical minds of this centuries (XX and XXI). So, take your time, make sure nothing will brake your listening, and do enjoy this musical rite as a true ascension to the heights of beauty."
3,Its a good dvd,"It seems to be a good dvd i like silvias and on this dvd there are some, it has some good things like nismo z and some history of the king of drift."
3,Edmund Lau Kok Ming Missed the Point,"While this isn't a great collection, Batman's speech was probably the high point: He's explaining that he HAS TO divorce himself emotionally from certain cases in order to investigate them properly: Right now he has to focus on the clues, without being distracted by his feelings for Lois. It's a bit creepy that he can do this so completely, but that's part of what makes the character interesting."
1,THIS ITEM IS WRONG!!!,I ordered these clips and received 1 pack(100ct). The description says 10 packs. So I contacted Amazon and ws told to ship back the 1pack and they would send me the proper 10 pack. I received another 1 pack. So I contacted Amazon again. Once again I received 1 pack. This time I was told that they would do a bin check and make sure that I got the item as described. I got another 1 pack!!!!! SO unless you want to spend $7 for 100 paper clips I would avoid this item.
5,Love this conditioner,"I have been using Trevor Sorbie products for years and love them. I especially like the conditioner. It is not heavy or sticky, but it gets the job done."
1,Not Originals,"I do not know who these singers are, but every song is off. They do not sound like the originals did and some do not sound even close. Very disappointed because no where does it say this on listing. I wish Amazon would be more truthful regarding these mp3's and I wish I could get my money back."
5,"Perfect for home use, heavy for travel","I bought this to be used with Nintendo Wii (about 40 watts) and charge my Linksys CIT300 Skype phone (15 watts). Been using it for a year, almost continuously. So far no problem. Pretty heavy for travel, but still okay. It's a transformer, how light can it be anyways? I have another combo step up/down transformer for home use (550W) and I gotta say not much difference in weight. My advice is to avoid using appliances that require a transformer when you travel. Get those ""universal"" chargers when available (which covers 110v to 240v, 50 - 60Hz). These are becoming standard in Asia but somehow not so in the US."
4,Travel Step Down Transformer,"The stepdown transformer does what it says it does. I took mine to Singapore for two items I own that don't have 220 volt capable chargers: a garmin gps, and a sonicare toothbrush. I also use it for a 110volt beard trimmer. All are low power draw so the capacity was plenty. I have used it for about two months at this point with no issue. I pack it in my checked luggage. It is a transformer so it it has a bit of weight to it. I gave it four stars because I like it. To love it I would want some way to cover the prongs (or fold them down) during travel so they don't stab my other luggage items - a minor issue to me."
2,Continuous?,"I bought this so that I could plug a small fan into it. Whenever I did so, it started to smoke and fried. I am almost positive that the fan was within the guidelines for wattage, so I don't think that was the case. I wonder if it really should not be used with continuous draw appliances, although it says it handles them."
3,Wake me when it's over,"How do you take a long story and turn it into a trilogy? You write a book of filler! Tiberius, who makes a surprise appearance at the end of Spectre, puts in a wonderful cameo here at the beginning and end of the book. In the middle, we are left with Kirk's life, and a hint of something strange happening on Deep Space 9 with Dr. M'Benga. In all honesty, there's really nothing in this book that demands an entire volume. Yes, Kirk's wedding is in here (who would have thought THAT could happen?), but it just sort of gets fuzzy from there. The mirror Picard and NextGen crew put in a brief appearance at the beginning, and then they are gone too. It's like the whole concept of the mirror universe loses it's appeal after the first book, and they decide to try something different. Janeway, who played such a big part of the first book, is quickly used here and then doesn't even show up in ""Preserver"". All in all, not a big winner, in my opinion."
3,I Wish They Had Told Me...,"Overall I enjoyed the book, but there is nothing on the cover or the anywhere else to let you know that it is one in a series. I was really ticked-off. I expected a conclusion to the various and interesting dilemas and storylines, and as the other reviewers have stated, the book has no ending! That is fine if the publisher makes it clear to the book buyers up-front (book 2 of a trilogy) or (book 9 of a series of 12) or whatever, but there was no indication at all that this book would not stand on its own, and I was very disappointed and even angry that I was not warned ahead of time. I don't mind series or trilogies, but I want to be told up front that is what I am buying.Two other observations 1) I knew as soon as they were married that Tachini (sp) was a goner (Kirk can never be married. The times he was in the original series, his wife and/or beloved died that very episode); and 2) If Tiberius had that many children, Kirk must have them also. Hmmm, makes you wonder."
2,The first disappointing Shatner Trek book.,"I've loved the Trek books, especially Shatner's, but this one was a big disappointment. It reads like 20 chapters plucked out of the middle of a larger book. In a true trilogy, each novel stands on its own. Not so here; Mr. Shatner and his publishers are too obviously milking a ""trilogy"" for the profits provided by 3 books instead of the one larger book that it really is. I'm annoyed I have to wait for the next book to find out how this story is supposed to end (but I'll buy it, of course)."
5,Keep them coming,"Shatner has done it again. The story line is twisted the characters well developed, and the anticipation kept at a high level throughout. I read it in 2 1/2 hours. The one thing I love about these books is the lack of a cutesy, animated character. Hopefully we will see as much action or more when Preserver is published. I also think that Shatner can keep Kirk going in future story lines."
4,Hard to put down,"I really enjoyed the book, but did not like the fact that I have to wait for the next book-Preserver- to know the ending."
2,This book was a disappointment.,"I've kept up with the Shatner Trek novels, and have liked them all, but, while DARK VICTORY is a great book in itself, it proved to be a disappointing read. Here I thought that we'd get a good look into the Mirror Universe that was so talked about in SPECTRE, but it only comes up at the beginning and end of the book. And I had also wanted to read more about Emperor Tiberius, but his appearance was equally as brief. Oh, well, maybe the next book, PRESERVER, will give me the Mirror Universe detail I hunger for."
2,"Need to wrap this ""alternate universe"" thing up","This book suffers from the fact it is Act 2 of a three act play. The story line is tedius and after an action packed start really bogs down. Yes we know Kirk loves Telanie but Shatner seems to dwell on this to the exclusion of all else. I have been a fan of the alternate universe since ""Mirror, Mirror"" on the original series. Loved ""Dark Mirror"" and always wondered why ""The Next Generation"" never pursued this story line. ""Spectre"" was a very good pickup for the story line, but this book was a real let down. I hop ""The Preservers"" finally ties this up, one way or the other. I know there is money in trilogies, but this series would have done better with the entire story told and wrapped up in one, or at the most, two books."
3,Good story but a little disappointing.....,"I've read ""Ashes of Eden, The Return, Avenger, Spectre"" and now this one. I'll be glad when ""Preserver"" finally comes out. I'll read it too but maybe the story line should have ended with this book."
5,#3 can't be published soon enough!,"Spectre was a little shallow compared to the previous Shatner/Reeves-Stevens books, but Dark Victory more than makes up for it. The book sets a breakneck pace right from the start, and then you run SMACK into a brick wall cliffhanger at the end of the book. It's rare these days to read a book I cannot put down, but I didn't want to stop reading this book. I found the scenes with the 2 Spocks ""fascinating"" to say the least, and it's seems quite ironic when they nail down the actual event that caused history to diverge in the 2 different universes. You'll have to read the book to find it out. I refuse to spoil your fun! Buy it, and enjoy."
5,Fascinating--a secret group w/in StarFleet,"I found Dark Victory startling for several reasons: 1. It continues the use of the savage characters from the original series episode ""Mirror,Mirror"", and Dark Victory's prequel, which introduces its readers with Kirk's double in the mirror universe named Emperor Tiberius. 2. It provides continuity with Kirk's rebirth in ""Generations"" and books such as ""Vengence"". 3. It uses characters from Star Trek-The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager in its plot line--Kirk's mirror universe counterpart seeks revenge from losing his bid to to conquer the Federation's universe by attempting to kill Kirk; failing that, he proceeds to attempt killing Kirk's new wife (A wife for ladies's man Kirk--incredible!). 4. We learn of ships staffed by holograms and a secret cabal w/in StarFleet called Project Sign.Clearly, a great novel to read on a rainy day!"
1,There is nothing new here.,"If you skip this book, you won't miss it. It ends just as it begins, a life and death struggle between Kirk and Anti-Kirk. I am not at all impressed with the conspiracy theories and hidden agendas that this book is peppered with. A secret organization in Starfeet, a hollographic crew on a star ship, and the dark yet sensitive side of Garak are just a few of the things that disappointed me. It is really beginning to amaze me just how many people from the original series have cheated death to survive in this era of Star Fleet. The Reeves duo may have given Shatner some suggestions on the writing of this book, but they sure didn't want their names on the cover and I don't blame them."
3,Not bad but my least favorite so far...,"I can't quite put a finger on what I didn't like about this book but it just didn't grab me like the rest have. As I've read in another review, it was definately a book in the middle of a trilogy. Just enough to continue the first and barely enough to lead into the next. I'm sure Perserver will wrap everyhting up but I'm not sure what purpose this bit of story line served.I have to say though that the think Shatner's books have been some of the best Star Trek novels I've ever read and would make an excellent couple movies (the first trilogy being an even numbered movie :D ). Too bad Paramount didn't send off the original cast with something more like these books."
2,"Nice Continuity, but no real plot","I anxiously awaited this sequel to Spectre, but I was unfortunately disappointed. This book is very obviously the middle of a trilogy. At the conclusion of the book, I was left with ""What was the point?"" Nothing of any substance seemed to happen in the entire novel. Rather, it seemed to me to be 303 pages of pure exposition. I hope that Preserver makes up for it...."
2,Dark Victory (Star Trek),"I have to say that I did enjoy this book, but was very dissappointed at the lack of content as well as story line. I have read all of the Shatner books, but this one feels like a very incomplete section of a much larger story. I don't mind series books, but they should at least have somewhat of a complete story line of thier own. This one does not and leaves you feeling very much like you have just watched a movie trailer."
3,No bad. Not one of the best,"As far as Star Trek novels go, Shatner is by far my favorite writer. This one isn't bad. The story line is OK and keeps you interested for the most part. I think he spent a little too much time rehashing his love for Tellani and his characterization on Piquard is a bit lacking. However, he tended to nail most of the other characters. Garak was particularly engaging.One thing I might note is that this book is full of typos, misspellings and bad punctuation. Sometimes divisions between chapter sections was missing as well. While the story isn't bad, it seems to have been thrown together in a hurry. Not like its predecessor, Specter. I hope that the next book in line is a better offering overall.I would like to mention that his later offerings, Captains's Blood, etc and Starfleet Academy, are far superior. Deninately worth a read."
2,Contrived and pedestrian,"Clearly the middle book in a series, this book seemed more than a little contrived on many levels. Is it really necessary to combine characters from four different Star Trek series (the original, TNG, DS9, and Voyager)? Kate Janeway, especially, seems to be present merely to lend her name to the book. Her presence doesn't seem to impact the story in any way, and it her role really isn't well defined. Its almost like she's included merely to tie Voyager into the mixture. Maybe some of this disjointedness results from the location in the series, as the book really doesn't stand well on its own.The writing is pedestrian, and the characters feel a bit flat and predictable. While some of the dialog does recall the amusing banter of the original crew, that really is about the only highlight in an otherwise mediocre work. This certainly hasn't inspire me to go out an find the other books in the series."
4,"Good but Agreed, this is just a filler","Eh. This book in itself is good, but a little less exciting than the previous ""Spectre"". It's pretty much a continuation in the trilogy but only serves to connect the first and last in this trilogy. So it's ok, not as good as Spectre, but in my opinion a lot better than ""Preserver"".I would still recommend reading this book, Shatner's Mirror Universe trilogy is a very great story and a must read. It just seems that all of the good stuff in this trilogy was put into the first book."
1,Too bad 0 stars isn't an option!,"William Shatner, in his old age, not wishing to accept the fact that in the present ST universe his character is dead, writes a piece of Kirk(self)- aggrandising junk like this. William Shatner has told Star Trek fans to get a life and yet write books and excepts fans to buy them. This work reveals William Shatner for the hypocrite that he is. I appeal to Pocket Books not to publish any more of his books."
3,With all the talk...,"about Dark Mirror, Spectre, DS9 and Dark Victory, the best mirror universe story is still the one that aired in 1967."
3,"Entertaining,but a year is to long to wait for part tnree.","I found Dark Victory to be an enjoyable read,and if it were followed by a sequel in two or three months,I would give it at least four stars.I feel that a year between parts of a trilogy is too long.If this is being done to sustain interest,then Mr Shatner is preaching to the choir.As far as the novel itself,I enjoyed the depiction of Tiberius greatly.One wonders how he can be defeated.I would have liked to have seen more of the history of the mirror universe,and how Tiberius survived. While this may have complicated the plot,it would have been interesting if some of the alternates from Deep Space Nine were thrown in also.I am anticipating Preserver."
5,Intricate,"William Shatner blends a little darker vision of the Star Trek world into his writings. Much like the Tek-War series, it is a more realistic view of the way things are. The Book is a wonderful continuation of his past books. I rank this one third behind The Return, and Ashes of Eden. All in all, very good."
3,Drawn out cliffhanger,"Dark Victory has a lot of build up throughout the book but it never delivers on any suspense that it builds. What happens if the author decides not to write anymore or, Heaven forbid, has a stroke or something and cannot write. I don't think that this book was written on that eventuality. There was nothing wrapped up. We would have been better off if he had done a very large book instead of the first two."
5,Killer!,I have used this trap for many years and it works great! It never breaks and it ALWAYS catches the gophers in my yard and my neighbors yard.
1,Trigger is not sensitive. Waste of money,"Mine did not work well at all. As another person said, the gopher can push a set trap out of tunnel and not spring the trap because the trigger is not sensative enough. I recommend Maccabee traps. They cost a little more, but I have had a lot better luck. I don't even waste my time setting the easy set traps. Avoid!"
1,Easy Set ???,It's called easy set but there were no instructions included. Doing this wrong looks like broken finger's. Instruction's pleaseVictor 0610 Easy Set Gopher Trap
3,"no packaging, no instructions","...looks like 40 cents worth of cheap wire and a nickel in sheet metal. NO indication of where it was manufactured. Not a clue as to how to set it or deploy it. ""Easy Set"" my A$$."
2,Use only with another resource,"It's is very obvious that the editors either completely ignored their job or have no idea that the DAT is completely computerized. It gives good tips on how to study and what not, but DON'T count on this book to help you do well. There are much better reviews out there. The sample tests are the best part. Other than that itn was a an okay book. Not to be used as the primary study tool."
1,"""A confusing, inaccurate depiction of the DAT...""","This book failed to prepare my students for the DAT and I highly reccomend purchasing another book. This book was inaccurate, ambiguous, which proved to me the author had no experience with the DAT or undergraduate course preparation. A travesty to the reputation of proper DAT preparation..."
3,It was average.,"It was far from spectacular. I found several errors and informed the editors. They will be corrected in the 2000 edition. I found that it did not give any insight in to the computerized DAT. In fact it gaves ways to study for just the written. This may be because it has not had many updates since late 80's. That bothers me! I have an 94' edition identical to my 99'. Not very many questions, more of a get you in the mood to study."
2,"Plotless, meandering, unsatisfying","Neslon fabricates three stories with the most unlikely of connections in order to have his characters at the main events of the early Civil War. None of the characters is particularly outstanding. The book is mainly concerned with getting from battle scene to battle scene, and describing the horrors of battle. Yawn. And guess what? The Confederacy loses! Still, it's not as bad as Guns of the South."
3,returned,"I found the description to be a little mis-leading and I thought I was ordering a 7 - Hole Punch; in fact it said up to 7 - Hole Punch, so it didn't really fit my need. I wish I had understood better; I could have saved the S/H both ways..."
3,"This version was tarnished silver not ""Gold""",I gave this as a gift to my mother and she did comment that the audio quailty was lacking. She loves Lionel Richie and the Commodoors-the songs/music but this CD was disappointing. Sorry Lionel....
5,This book is great!,"Of all the books I have tried for learning French on my own, I like this one best. The instructions are clear, the material is interesting - and useful - you learn to say exactly what you need to say in everyday life. The pronunciation and spelling guidelines presented are very helpful. I am pleased at how much French I have been able to learn without taking classes. Thank you, Mr. Mercado!"
4,I Got Your Love cd single review,"Great song! Donna's vocals are perfection! I love her abiblity to belt out a tune as well as soften a lyric when the words and music call for it. The best mix here is the Ralphi Rosario mix by far. The Eddie Baez mix had to grow on me. Although it's slower than Rosario's, I still like it. The LEX mix does not get my attention. I'm not loving that one! I give this cd single a 4 just because of LEX, not Donna:) Otherwise, the mixes are just great."
4,THE VOICE,"While most pop female vocal abilites begin to wane when they hit their 40's, this woman's voice remains invincible. Her voice is as strong as it was 30 years ago when she was just getting started. The best remixes on the single are those of Ralph Rosario."
2,ONE GREAT SONG FROM THE ULTIMATE DIVA,"""I GOT YOUR LOVE""; IS A GREAT DANCE SONG, YOU WILL ENJOY IT, DANCE IT AND LOVE IT, THE ULTIMATE DANCE DIVA SHINES AGAIN!"
4,ignore the copy protect threat,"I know a lot of people who are not buying this album because they see the copy-protect threat on the cover and think they won't be able to rip if for their mp3 players, but it is very easy to bypass and this album is worth having. If you are using windows, make sure you disable autorun on your cdrom drive (hold down the shift key when you load your disk, or look for instructions on the web for a permanent fix through windows registry). If you fail to do this, loading the disk in your computer will automatically install scumware on your computer without your consent.The album itself is excellent, and I think anyone who enjoyed the first album will enjoy this one as well. It's pretty rare that I enjoy an album from start to finish without skipping a few tracks, but this is one of those albums I can listen to straight through."
4,Great Album - Glad to see they are touring UK,"Criminally, this album does not seem to be commercially available in the UK, which is bizarre as we just cannot get enough of this 80s alternative sound right now, especially when it emanates from a US band. Witness the huge success of The Killers and Interpol right across Europe.Unlike many other acts, they have managed to combine commercial melodies without falling into soft rock cliches, a la Robbie Williams. There is very little filler on the album and its melange of soaring guitars, synths and very 80s Brit Alternative vocals is great. Why they recorded in New York and LA is a mystery to me.""On my Own"" is the best thing they have ever done. Its plaintiveness reminds me of early Cocteau Twins. Just brilliant."
3,There are ways around copy protection...,"The album is ok. I prefer the first one myself. Regarding copy protection, do a little research on the web. There are programs like Clone CD that will enable you to bypass copy protection and put the music on your iPod."
2,So disappointed!,"I agree with everything Andy French ""Crotchety Music Fan"" said. The first album was amazing, a classic, something I have played endlessly and will enjoy forever. All great songs, all different, one from the other. I so looked forward to this, and now that I have it, it's simply boring, boring, boring!"
2,"Beautiful swing, but boring","I have twin girls, and so we have two of these swings. When I first saw this pattern, I just had to have it! I thought the Canterbury pattern was just so beautiful (I also have the pack-and-play in the same pattern).When my girls were first born, they loved being in this swing. The music was nice, the speeds were good, and when they could start seeing further away, the lambs were very calming for them.But now that they are 4 and 1/2 months old, they are bored with it. The lambs floating above their heads just aren't cutting it for them. When we visited some family, my girls used a Fisher Price Flutterbye Dreams swing, and they absolutely loved it! It had sounds and lights, and toys for them to pull on and play with. I wish I had done more research before purchasing these Graco swings. In my opinion, this swing is a waste of money."
4,"Great, but not perfect","The many testimonials for this product speak for themselves. I also was happy with the quality of the egg poaching, and I appreciated the toast/egg function that allows the two to be done at the same time. My only gripe is the egg tray is in no way ""non-stick"" and even spraying it or putting some oil in there the egg needs a little finagling to get loose. That's the only thing holding this back from a 5!"
1,A terrible product,"After the first few weeks, the novelty wears off and what you are left with is a toaster that doesn't work very well. It is a very SLOW toaster that does not accomodate large pieces of bread.While the basic idea of making egg and muffin sandwiches is cool, the implementation is poor. What you need to know is that the egg is cooked by boiling a measured amount of water. The steam cooks the egg, but it also condenses all over the egg - leaving you with a soggy sandwich."
4,"Perfect poached eggs, almost perfect toaster","I love poached eggs but have a hard time getting them just right when I make them on the stove; I tried a microwave poacher and that thing was useless. Then I got this, and now I get all giddy at breakfast!The eggs come out exactly how I like them when poaching--although if I put in a second one after the first one is done, it gets a little overdone. When I used scrambled egg it didn't seem to cook all the way through but a few seconds in the microwave fixed that.My only complaint is that the toaster slots are so deep, it is difficult to get English muffins out of the toaster when they're done. Perhaps this device should come with toast tongs!"
3,Everyone laughed when we got it. The joke's on them. Sort of.,"This was great for about a year. Or, maybe six months. We used it a few times a week and enjoyed it very much. Unfortunately, the little pan in which your egg cooks is coated with some sort of teflon and a very low-grade one at that. Even using plastic implements and cooking spray, my egg would stick. And then, when my egg came out, it would strip away some of the teflon. Teflon is lame as a seasoning. I'd like to get a new egg pan, but I'm not sure they are for sale, separately. Also, since I don't use that anymore, this is just a big toaster. As a toaster, it's pretty crappy.I enjoyed this product and feel I got my money out of it (even the ones I gave as gifts), but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,didn't last long,"""Clever"", I thought when I saw this thing. BUT, it never did toast well and if you didn't have really short bread the top half inch or so didn't toast at all. It toasts unevenly as well and it takes a long time. The egg side worked about 3 times and just stopped. It's a cheap, but not inexpensive, product."
5,Super Toaster!,"I gave this to my Dad for Christmas, and it was so great I bought one for myself! We tried soft-boiled eggs and a ""poached"" egg, and both cooked perfectly. The toaster toasts very evenly. Two comments I'd like to add are:1. The ""poached"" egg is not actually sitting in water like a real poached egg, so it's actually better.2. If you cook your egg in the shell, you cannot use the meat tray at the same time. That was a disappointment.And a small piece of advice: run the toaster without bread a couple of times when you first get it, or your first toast will taste like new appliance."
5,First impression,"This is my first impression. This thing is great. We will not be going to McDonalds ever again. Little advice. if it is a large-xlarge egg, use a little more water. if it is a medium egg use the directions. It was not runny just personally i like my eggs fully cooked to a scrambled consistancy. If i have issues in the future, I will buy anoother one. 30 bucks for a great machine like this is worth buying once a year. Think about the cost savings. Im sure you will save more than 30 bucks if your a avid breakfast eater. you should eat breakfast every morning. it is the most important meal of the day. that is why they call it Break Fast. Your breaking the 8hour + fast....Cheers..."
1,Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher,"This is the 2nd toaster I have purchased. The first one lasted about 6 months with minimal use when the toaster part of this unit quit heating. I took it apart to investigate but there are solid state circuits to deal with so I simply threw it away. I bought a 2nd one 6 weeks ago and the egg poacher part of this unit only worked once before it stopped heating. ONCE!!!! Although I like the concept of having a dual purpose toaster, I won't waste my money on another one.UPDATE: Yesterday while the toaster was simply sitting on the counter not being used, it started buzzing. I heard it from a different room and by the time I got to it, it burst into flames. I quickly unplugged it. Had we not been home when it decided to self destruct, it may have burned the house down."
1,"Loved it, while it lasted","I loved, loved, loved this little toaster-for about a year. Now all of a sudden the egg cooker doesn't work. And now all I can do is toast. And frankly, it's not a great toaster. I always have to put my toaster waffles in twice and I have to flip them mid way so that I don't get burned on one side and soggy on the other."
1,Egg McBreakin',"We've been through 3 of these. When they work - they're great, buuut they keep breaking! Three months is the most we've gotten out of one. Just say no until they improve the quality.Update: The fourth one crashed and burned - well actually didn't burn, as the toaster stopped working. Great idea. TERRIBLE execution."
4,Works very well,"We recently had to replace our toaster because one of the cats had knocked it to the floor when jumping onto the counter. While researching for a new one I came across the Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher. A clever idea but how useful would it be in practice? However, the price was right and there would be no problems returning it to Amazon, so I ordered it. After using it for a month here are my observations.1. Toasting performance: excellent; it may be the best toaster I have owned.2. Cooking a poached egg: excellent and very easy to do.3. Cooking soft/hard boiled eggs: not as good. The shells need to be pierced and sometimes the cooked egg will ooze from the hole. The bottom of the supplied water measuring cup has an egg piercer.4. A complete toast/poached egg/Canadian bacon sandwich: perfect.5. Cleanup: very easy.Overall I am very pleased with the unit and would deinitely recommend it to others."
3,It's very convenient,"It's very convenient, however, the egg tray was scratched right away. I just used the rough side of the sponge to clean it, the tyflon went away. With all the terrible stories about tyflon, I don't think this egg tray was built with good quality."
2,It was great when it worked.,I have purchased 3 of these and all 3 of them the egg part broke within a year. This function was only used about once a week so we are not talking about heavy use either. I kept buying them because I really like it when it works but I am tired of buying a product that doesnt work.
5,Toast and Egg poacher,"I have used my single egg, two slot toaster for over a year and wouldpanic if anything happened to it. I use it at least 5 times weekly.Makes the same quality poached egg and toast every time by using themeasuring cup. Now I find I can even buy the two egg, four slot toaster;which I will."
2,Not that eggciting.,"This would be exciting for one person, but I have three men to feed in the AM so I found it a bit time consuming. I can make two egg McMuffins at the same time using the microwave and toaster,plus clean up is much easier ."
3,"Defective, but I want to try another one","The first time I used this item the result was fantastic. I cooked the egg and english muffin in the unit, then added cheese and ham (that I microwaved beforehand for 7 seconds). It tasted great! Easy to clean-up too.However, after the first time the toaster lever would not stay down. I called the manufacturer and they told me ""cut the cord in half and return it to us, or return it to the point of sale."" I'm returning it to Amazon, but I've requested a replacement. I'm excited by an excellent first result and I want to try it again.The unit cost me $34.88, but now I see it's on-sale for $29.99.If the unit had not broke, I would have given it 5-stars. But since it broke (and the manufacturer quickly said ""return it,"" indicating to me they've seen this problem before), I have to give it only 3."
5,AWESOME,"I love cooking my egg, sausage muffins in this. Tastes great, my 4 yr old loves them.** I read another review below about you only being able to cook one egg every hour because of the timer?? I don't know what that person is doing because I can cook as many as I want as soon as each egg is ready. Which is about every couple minutes!!"
2,"Good egg, so- so toaster","The egg poacher and boiler is surprisingly good. Every egg you poach turns out perfectly done once you get the water measurement down pat and the hard boiled system is faster and better than the old water in the pot method. But, unfortunately the toaster toasts unevenly (one side is browner than the other)and the overall quality of construction is cheap but it's servicable."
4,good new item,"Well I like a nice round egg to fit exactly on my English muffin. The egg comes out with a little practice and lots of oil or butter perfectly cooked and just the right size. The Muffin however comes a little burned on the bottom if you want to cook top and bottom slices together, but I am a purist and few toasters can do any better, except for toaster over I have that is 50 plus years old. I generally cook my bacon via the microwave, the muffin in my other toaster oven and the egg in this gadget. It also warms pre-cooked meat with the egg very nicely if you want a ham and egg, e.g., sandwich. I admire it even with the drawbacks"
2,Worked Great for about 8 months,"Loved this item for the 8 months it worked. Was not overused by any means, maybe once every week or two. Then it just would no longer cook the egg. So, take it for what it is. I found out you can make the same breakfast sandwiches pretty easily using a small frypan. (Can even do two at once)"
1,Toaster didn't work even on the first day of use!,"I bought this as a gift. I was so disappointed when I found out that the toaster part didn't even work the first time they tried to use it. The egg poacher worked great, but if half of the appliance is non-functional then what's the point? It seems a lot of people had this problem. I doubt exchanging it will even result in a functional toaster based on other reviews."
1,It didn't last!!!!,"Let me start by saying I would have rated this item highly if I had reviewed it when my husband gave it to me. I loved it and it did the job. It was convenient and saved me time in the morning. However after about 4-5 months the egg portion stopped working and shortly after, the toaster stopped working as well. I called the company and they couldn't do anything for me. So I turned to amazon and was considering purchasing another one but after reading the reviews and realizing a lot of other people had the same problem I decided to go back to a regular but yet realiable toaster."
5,Breakfast Made Easy!,"A bowl of cereal would be quicker, but building a breakfast sandwich is, somehow, satisfying. With cereal for breakfast, you pour and eat giving you more time to get ready for work. Well, with this 'breakfast machine,' you can set everything to cooking and continue getting ready for your day, then come back when it's finished. One reviewer stated that the toaster's keep warm function dried out whatever you toasted. This is true, so my 'trick' is to get the egg and meat cooking, then slice the English muffin and pop it in the microwave for about 15 seconds; this will soften the muffin a lot. After the egg and meat completes the cycle, I put the muffin in the toaster and toast it normally. If you leave the meat and egg on the cooker (maybe cover the vent with a folded paper towel (AFTER the cooking cycle completes!) to hold in the heat a little, every thing comes out just right."
2,Great while it lasts,The unit is great as long as it lasts. My egg poacher lasted for around 6 months and the toaster 6 months past that. Unfortunately no other company makes a comparable product. There are two other brands but both are owned by Back to Basics. I will buy a new one and hope that a company that has a quality control department starts putting out a similar product before this unit craps out as it appears is standard.
5,Amazingly simple...amazingly good,"I was tired of paying $4 plus for a breakfast in the morning made with low quality meat and eggs. I purchased this product and I could not be happier with my purchase. For starters, it is incredibly easy to operate. Pour the water into the cup, add your egg, add a piece of meat, place the top on, and then press down. It couldn't be any easier. You can even add your bread and do it all in one step. Once you press start you can just walk away and in only a few minutes everything is done and ready for assembly.The egg is always cooked perfectly, the meat is always hot, and the bread is heated to just the right amount. I challenge anyone to find a better machine to make an egg sandwich. Cleaning is also easy, just throw everything into the dishwasher.A++"
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this item 11 months ago & I've only used it ~10 times. I tried to use the toaster this morning, & it is DEAD. Be warned - this is a poor quality product."
5,Superb product,"This cooks eggs perfectly and with so little effort. The toaster looks great, and better yet, does what it's supposed to do. My visiting son fell in love and took my first one, so had to order a second."
5,Best toaster ever,"This is the best toaster I ever owned. Eggs and toasts come out perfect every time. Can heat up a complete single breakfast at once (toast, egg and precooked sausage). Wide openings are great for bagels also. The only thing that could be improved is the height of the internal toast holders. When toasts are ready, you need to get too close to the openings to pull them out while the toaster is HOT.Another minor suggestion I would give the manufacturer is to print the numbers on the measuring cup (used for adding water to the egg cooker) black or a dark color. I have a difficult time seem them since they are clear (same as the cup)."
3,This one didn't work,"This is the third one of these I have purchased and the egg cooker was dead when I received it. The other two work well and are a great timesaver. They aren't visually appealing but are very useful. I rated a 3 because this one didn't work, but when they work they are at least a 4"
1,Not worth the money,"Toaster never worked right (deeply browned on one side, barely browned on the other); egg poacher after 5 months use."
1,Malfunctioned after a few uses,"The toaster stopped working completely after a few uses. At first, I thought I was not using it correctly but after very few uses the toaster just would not come on after trying differnet options over and over. Since I had used it infrequently, it was too late to return it."
2,OK while it lasted,"When this toaster found it place on our kitchen counter, it worked like a charm. Made nice toast and made it easy to poach an egg. Then after less than 12 months of use, it would only make eggs. Toaster side quit. Not so sure we want to buy a new toaster every few months. Makes no sense at all. If you buy this toaster, enjoy it while it works. Take a picture of it working too. The picture will out last the toaster so you will be able to look back on the good old days when you were able to make toast."
2,Buyer Beware!,"I loved this toaster... for the 1 month it worked! We used it almost daily, although we couldn't eat at the same time. We were enamored with the novelty of it all. Then it stopped working completely!(The electric control panel on the side mediates every function and once that goes out you can't even make toast.) Leaving us with no hot toast for our homemade jam during breakfast. It was supposed to have warranty for a year, but Back to Basics is hard to contact and won't respond to emails. Amazon has no return policy that covers items that break either. I ended up buying a Cuisinart toaster from Costco, and a stove top egg poacher that works even better in the same amount of time with double the output, so we won't ever be caught toast-less again! Now I have to find a way to recycle this worthless hunk of plastic. Buy this item only if you have time and money to waste replacing it."
1,"GREAT IDEA, VERY POOR QUALITY","Purchased this toaster for my new apartment in order to make quick and easy breakfast egg sandwiches. For first few months this toaster worked as promised, however, after about 4 months the egg cooker broke and is not longer functioning. I guess something ""burned out"" and now only the toaster works. I have read someone else had the same problem and thought it's an isolated case, I was wrong.The overall quality of this toaster is poor and I do not expect to be using it much longer. Plan to replace it with the Breville CT70XL."
1,Bad toaster,"I'll be returning this. One side of the toast (the side facing the center of the unit) is much much darker than the other side. If it can't even make toast properly, who needs it? Also, the slots are even narrower than my Hamilton Beach, so I have to cut off even more from wide breads. If this unit really were ""Back to Basics,"" maybe it would just make decent toast, but it doesn't."
4,Toast and more,"The egg poach function totally sold me on this. And it does work fine. Cooks hard or softboiled eggs to perfection. Haven't tried the heating tray yet. The toaster function however is a different story. It seems it toast from one side only. Be careful to choose the right level, i ""charcoaled"" a few pieces of toast before i found the level that works for me.Also, take the time to read the instructions. Especially when you plan to use the toast and egg poach function at the same time. I didn't and freaked when the toaster part didn't work when i started poaching the egg. Well, doesn't it make only sense that the egg takes longer than the toast? Back To Basics wants to make sure both, your egg and toast are done at the same time."
1,the worst toaster ever,"This is the worst toaster we have ever owned! Within two months, one of the slot ""holders"" broke. The other slot toasts one side of the bread only, and burns part of that side."
1,Not a good toaster,"I bought it mainly to use as a toaster, with egg poacher as a nice add on. However, it does not toast evenly on both sides! One side comes out nice and brown, but the other side is burned. It's useless for me."
1,Totally broken after 2 years,"The egg poacher was broken after 2 months.The toaster is broken after 2 years.Before I buy other toaster, I am writing a review.I recommend you not to buy this product."
1,Did not live up to expectations,Toaster toasted unevenly (toasted on one side of bread but not on the other). Poached eggs were over cooked no matter how I tried adjusting the water and the cooking time. My husband burn his hand on the steam when trying to remove the poached egg. I would not purchase this product again.
2,good while it lasted,I think the idea is great.and my unit functioned until the toaster fritzed.a call to the company resulted in nothing.so there goes $30.
2,Not in for the long (or mid-range) haul,"We owned this appliance five years. It completely died last weekend. The toaster had stopped working (you would press the ""toast"" button and nothing would happen) about two years after we bought it, but we kept it around because it was a handy way to ""boil"" eggs without having to use the stove. Well, the egg/sausage heating part of it stopped working too now. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but I expect an appliance to work -- and fully work, not just half work -- for at least 10 or 15 years, if not 30. We will be buying a simple egg cooker now, and will continue to use the well-functioning Cuisinart toaster we bought over 10 years ago. I do not recommend buying this product, and would not buy it again. Its quality is sub-par."
1,Didn't Last,The egg cooker stopped working within the first two months.. So disappointed. It's going to Goodwill now.
1,Fire Hazard,"For anyone looking to buy this product, mine which was used sparingly over the last year decided to turn the poacher section on all on its own and almost burned down our kitchen. The controller shorted out and turned on the heating plate until it started smoking and burning. Manufacturer will not respond to our complaints for over two weeks now."
1,"clever idea, terrible product",The idea of toasting and poaching an egg at the same time seemed great to me. And it worked twice... then the egg poacher stopped working completely. Would never buy this product again and wouldn't recommend it to anybody.
3,thought it be better...,"I bought this toaster based on great reviews. And who dosent like to have toast and eggs done at the same time. Its a good idea but it needs a few changes. The first thing I did not like was that the machine steams the egg and i do not like that. It just makes the whole kitchen smell like sulfur. The little pan thats inside is not non stick and even when i tried to put a bit of butter in it the egg still sticked to the little pan. The area where you put water not so easy to clean in my opinion, i tried to really clean it with a wet towel but residue still stayed."
1,It broke twice,"After a month of use this toaster broke, so we took it back and got a new one. On the second toaster, the egg poacher stopping working after a few short months. Today the toaster stopped working completely, and we have only had it for a year. I don't know if it is just bad luck or poor construction. I will be searching for a new, faster toaster without the egg poacher."
5,Works great!,"Very nifty machine. It is fun to use. Although it takes a bit more time to make than I thought, it's faster than doing everything separately. Recommended."
2,great egg poacher- terrible toaster,"I really wanted to like this appliance. I like toast and I like poached eggs and so many people loved it, reviewed and recommended it.The first toaster that I got burned the toast everytime at any setting. I called the manufacturer and after a few weeks they replaced my ""defective toaster"" with a new one. I was really pleased at a company supporting their product so easily.I have had this toaster for a few months and it is just as bad as the first one. Burnt toast at any setting. Usually only on one side of the toast but the smell lingers and I am pretty tired of scraping toast. If I stand there and set it on the lightest setting and watch it, then I can get light toast on one side and no toasting on the other side.Very disappointing. Clearly some manufacturing error continues to plague these toasters."
1,was good not anygood anymore,"had one before it broke was a great toaster...got a second one it was good then it broke again...got another broke fast ,,,,,,,,,same name another co.i guess looks the same but it dont last"
2,Good while it lasted,I used this product every day for about two months. At that time the egg poacher stopped working. Very disappointing that it didn't last longer.
3,Very nice,"I really like that I can make an egg, warm meat and toast and English muffin or bagel at the same time. It cooks/heats very well. The only problem I had with it was when I added water to the hard cooked egg line (lowest line on that level) some of the water bubbled out. That caused some of the egg to go down in the bottom pan and it was tough to scrub out, even after soaking a while. I owned a Basic egg/muffin toaster before and it was much easier to clean (only reason I stopped using that was it started leaking water)."
2,Grey eggs,"I have had this toaster for about a year and while I loved it at first, now every time I make eggs in it (I prefer scrambled so that's what I make) they turn out greenish-grey. I wash the various parts every time and I don't know what is going on - I use fresh organic eggs so this certainly should not be happening."
4,Mostly great,"It's great being able to easily hard/soft boil eggs. It does that great.The main bad thing is that over time, it seems the water boiler can leak a bit (even when I only add in the water as suggested on the cup it comes with). I might just be doing something wrong though. I've had it for 6 months. The only other irritation is if you do egg+toast, then it waits to pop up the toast until the eggs are done, so the toast isn't very warm by that time. I suggest doing one then the other."
2,Works great when it actually works...,The egg poacher broke after a few months. Toaster is still going strong after 2 years. This thing really did work well for the first two months though. A little bit of nonstick spray and you're good to go for poached eggs. Boiled eggs are just as easy.I am seriously considering buying another in hopes they fixed the faults.
5,works great...the breakfast on the go,"I bought this toaster about 3 years ago and am still using it as my main toaster. I do the muffin egg thing about twice a week and love how fast it is. I set it up, run through the shower and come back to slap everything together as I head out the door.Works great...last long time....just plain awesome!!!"
2,Nice when it worked...,"Unfortunately it only worked for 2 months, at which time the egg heating element stopped working. Really disappointing, but I guess I should have known from all the bad reviews that say the exact same thing. Also, I agree that the toaster takes way too long to be useful on it's own. This thing is going in the trash where it belongs."
1,stay away,"When it was new, the toast and the egg were cooked together and both hot when finished. Now, after a year, the toast gets done first and sits there until the egg is done. After a year, it does not toast even. When it is finished, one side is not even toasted so you have to turn it and put it down again which results in the toasted side to done. Stay Away, buy a cheap toaster."
3,Good product but not for long time,"I bought this toast one year ago. It worked fantastic. The egg cooker was great and convenient. But after one year, the egg cooker was broken for no reason."
2,Dead After Three Months,"We received this egg poacher/toaster combination shortly before our wedding in August. I think we got about 10 uses out of the egg poacher before that died in September. It just turned off and wouldn't heat. Granted, we had no problems with the Teflon coating like others have complained about before it died, but perhaps that's because it didn't last long enough to cause us trouble. Yesterday on Thanksgiving, the toaster died completely. I expect the shelf life of a cheap kitchen appliance to be about a year but the Back 2 Basics poacher/toaster combo death was grossly premature. It's a fantastic idea and works well... while it lasts."
1,Egg poacher died,"Well at first I loved my little toaster that could make me an egg/english muffin in one... until it died on me. The egg poacher just didn't work one day, the previous day it was fine, the next, no heat. I also had issues with the teflon flaking off into my eggs. No telling how much of that I have eaten in the past month or so. Like others have said, it's a great idea, I certainly was enjoying it until it broke. Wish they could make a quality product. If anyone has any tips on repairing these, please let us know."
5,Everything it's supposed to be.,"Once you figure-out the amt of water to get the egg the way you want it, this makes a perfect egg muffin every time."
5,Excellent for Camping,"We bought this to use in our motorhome. It is great to be able to make a breakfast sandwich and not have loads of dishes to do. This cooks the egg, english muffin, and bacon just perfect. We love this and would recommend it to anyone that wants an easy, quick breakfast."
5,Office breakfast,Got it for the office. We use it on average 4 times a day M-F. Works great! Been very happy with it.
3,I Use It Frequently,"It tends to overcook my eggs, unless a small amount of water is used. Overall, a good product that I would recommend for anyone that likes toast and eggs."
4,Pretty cool!,My husband loves those egg mcmuffins and now we can make them at home. I love to use it to boil eggs without having to keep an eye on it!
3,Ok,This was ok but I got tired of it after a few weeks and gave it away. Works well but seemed to take a long time for the egg to cook and then my bread was cold!
1,Egg cooker dies after only a few uses - very common issue,"Ok it did fine the first few weeks, everything cooked the way it should have.The toast finishes before the egg and the toast is cold by the time the egg is finished.Red lights instead of Blue, as the instructions state.Now after only less then a dozen uses the egg cooker doesn't heat up anymore.This was such a good idea, unfortunately, poorly made.Very frustrated that I spent money on something I knew to be too good to be true.Now I am stuck with have an appliance. and out the full price."
4,Not bad at all,"Got this a couple weeks ago. It's fun and easy to use, nice for a quick healthy snack. My favorite thing is little thing can make is: toast w/peanut butter, an eggover top a little salt and shredded cheese sprinkled on top. Any who, only complaint is I wish I had bought the double instead of the single, it would be nice to make too eggs at once since it takes about 10 mins to cook the egg."
4,Toaster plus,We've used this toaster/egg cooker several times now and really like it. I wish we didn't have to spray with pam - but other than that we are very happy with it.
5,Oh how I've missed this -So glad to have it in my kitchen again!,"We had the 4 slice Egg-and-Muffin Toaster and Egg Poacher and used it until it finally just up and died. At the time we had 3 teenagers in the house and were always hard pressed for time in the morning. This was a godsend to our family!I recently replaced it with the 2 slice, as it's now just the two of us at home. I believe I've used it nearly EVERY SINGLE day since! We also love having hard boiled on hand and make them perfectly in minutes.I don't plan to ever be without this machine in my kitchen again.I HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone!!!"
1,tem500 egg & muffin 2-slice toaster & egg poacher,the poacher portion of this toaster/poacher will not work...it came broken and i through box away....can it be replaced????ben slack
3,great if hand washed,"This was my favorite kitchen item. Love making breakfast in one easy step. That was until I stuck the egg cooker in the dishwasher. Now, no matter how much spray non stick stuff I use, the eggs stick."
1,Arrived broken but they are sending a replacement!,"The bad news is that I just purchased this item, and while the toaster worked great, the egg cooker did not work at all. The good news is that all it took was one simple phone call (no hold time) and a replacement unit is on the way. They even sent me a UPS label to return the old one!"
2,well it was cool for a year,"I was told really good things about this brand, so im disappointed it only lasted for a limited time. the egg mcmuffin thing broke, but it still functions as a toaster. i hardly used it as an egg mucmuffin thing and thought it was pretty neat when boiling eggs a couple of times but thats about it. it broke only after i used it maybe 5 times. i also have the blender that doesnt chop anything worth a ... i would not buy this brand again. i just purchased a cheaper less known brand blender that works 10x better, i would recommend a cheaper toaster too."
2,so-so,"it does everything it says it will do, but it doesn't do anything very well. i guess that's the trade off for it's convenience. i can't really recommend it based upon the quality of performance."
2,Not a good product,"Hey,I bought it a month back and never used in US, after coming to india when i used this with US adapter which converts 220V to 120V - smoke was coming out from side ...then some smell and sound too. and lever in this was also not at all going down. After this its not working now."
1,returned it right away,"too many parts to keep track of and to clean. you have to stack four things in the right order to poach an egg. the toaster component works fine, but is really too small to do anything larger than a muffin or small toast. not wide enough for bagel. not long enough to do more than half of the different breads i use. don't bother"
1,Don't buy it if you want eggs!,"I purchased this toaster and was very dissappointed! The egg side works when it feels like it. I wrote to the manufacturer and they never even acknowledged my complaint. It makes good toast but if you're buying it for the convenience of making eggs, invest in a good pan!"
1,Fire Hazard,"I own this product and liked it the first few times I used it, but then the egg side quit working. Then this morning, the toaster started on its own, made a buzzing noise and started heating up - this while the household was still in bed. Do not buy if you don't want a fire"
2,"Good idea, but poor quality","Had this for a little over a year of actually using it - as with everyone else, the teflon peeled off the pan with in the first 10 uses. It probably best to just get a scraper and scrape the whole pan clean so you won't get it in your egg. A few months ago, the egg poacher stopped working, so I had an expensive toaster - now the toaster has stopped working, so I have nothing. I would expect a product this expensive to have better durability. Most toasters last more than 5 years, never mind one year. I guess you pay a premium for the 'idea' of an egg toaster (no doubt patented so no one else can actually build it more reliably). I am considering buying a new one, (since the price went down $10 from when I bought it), but I'm not convinced it will last any longer than the old one. So I'll probably stick to my toaster oven and make eggs in the frypan.."
2,seemed super at first,"When I first got this toaster as a wedding gift I was ecstatic, I love breakfast sandwiches and this was a great way to make them at home for way less. Unfortunately, less than a year after we started using it, the egg poacher stopped working and it started making a weird buzzing noise. Then within a month of the egg poacher dying, the toaster part gave out too. Now keep in mind I used the toaster part almost every day, but the toaster that I had before this one, which thankfully I had kept, in case my step-son needed one for his apartment, and am back to using now gets used just as often, and I've used for almost 3 years."
4,GOOD DEAL - NICE PRODUCT,PRETTY COOL PRODUCTTOASTER TAKES A LIL WHILE BUT TIMES OUT GOOD WITH EGGCOOKKS GOOD - NICE CLEANUP - FAST
4,Back to basics toaster,"This is the second toaster of this kind that we have purchased. We love it's multi-function capabilities. We can make an egg/Canadian bacon/muffin sandwich in the comfort of our home. It is very easy and teens can easily use this. We liked it so much that we bought it for several of our adult children. The only problem we had is that the egg poacher part ceased to function after about two years. Every other toaster I have had in the past has lasted much longer than this and while the toaster part still worked, without the egg poacher part functioning, it was ""just"" a toaster. That being said, we liked it enough to purchase it again. If this one goes kaput in the same length of time, I would not purchase it again."
4,Handy!,"It's a handy appliance that can multi-task. I have to agree with those that say that it's kind of cheaply made though. A lot of the pieces for the egg poaching/heating up pre-made food are made out of plastic. These are exposed to a lot of heat (from steam) and I don't know how long they'll last. So far none of it is showing signs of wear. The bottom part for the poacher where water should go is chrome plated. After one use it's already speckled with tarnish. Maybe this is normal wear and tear, but I'm very picky with my things and would like them to stay in pristine condition. For the price, I say it's worth it. It looks good and the toaster works great. But I really wish it would've been made better so it'll last longer."
4,The toaster part is good,The toaster part does its job well but the egg cooker is very finicky and doesn't cook evenly. Make sure you use 'lots' of spray-on oil to avoid having your breakfast concreted on the fryer.
4,Follow cleaning instructions - learned the hard way.,"A few tips:Make sure you HAND WASH all the trays. I was foolish and put them in the dishwasher. After a few months, the nonstick surfaces started PEELING OFF the trays and the handle on the egg tray disintegrated.Also, don't lose the water measurer. It gives you the correct amount of water needed to steam the eggs/meat and without that you'd have to guess at the amount and can end up over cooking or under cooking the eggs.Only cook ONE egg in the egg tray. You can do two, but it takes more water and more time and you kinda have to guess at the measurements.If you take care of this little machine, it makes amazing breakfast sandwiches and is a favorite and much requested item in our household. I think I will be buying the bigger version, however, because it takes about 4-5 minutes for each sandwich and when the family is hungry, they don't like to wait. :)"
4,Excellent for 1,"Bought this for my husband because he makes breakfast for the family in the morning. It is very effective and cooks everything well. For 1 person it would be perfect, for a family, you have to wait your turn."
5,Wonderful Toaster.,"This thing is just great! No more digging out the fry pan and the mess and time associated with frying eggs. The egg poacher works perfect. The toasted english muffins cook simultaneously with the poached eggs, so they are both done at the same time. It seems very well built to me. You can't go wrong for just $30.00 on this small wonder."
1,Poor quality,"Back to basics TEM599 Egg and Muffin toaster:Although this is a great idea, the produce is cheaply made and does not hold up. I enoyed mine three time before it malfunctioned. Please save your money."
5,Works great!,"I was a little skeptical before purchasing, but it has turned out to be a great product. I usually have a hard boiled egg and a piece of toast in the morning. By the time my coffee has brewed the egg is done. Two thumbs up!"
2,NOT Made To Last,"I thought this was a winning combination, and it ""was"" until it died after about 15 months of light use. The company (Back To Basics) only offered a 30% discount on their web site toward the purchase of a new unit, but the price Amazon sells this toaster for is less than their discounted price, what a joke. Anyway, I really don't want to buy another toaster that will only work for a little over a year (putting it out of warranty) and then quit. My recommendation; do not buy this product, it is a waste of money, even though it does work nicely for a while."
3,"Good, but doesn't last","I'm on my third one of these. It is a great product, we use it frequently, but don't expect it to last more than 2 years. No one else makes anything like it, and it does work well until it breaks... The price is right for me, if it was more expensive I would not keep buying them."
5,Great way to start the day with a balanced breakfast with no cooking.,"I used a gift card from my sister to purchase this as a gift for my wife. She was making a type of egg boil breakfast in the skillet. She loves this egg poacher because her eggs are not runny or watery any more.I use an all egg white product for a no fat poached egg on toast breakfast.Cook the egg first then toast the bread for best results.What a great concept and works very efficently also.No more high carb, suger cereal breakfasts for me."
3,Why the price hike?,"This product does work great and it is easy to use and clean. When I purchased I paid $35., now that I wanted to get one for my daughter it is over $50.....why?"
5,Toaster/egg maker,"I love this thing and have been using all week. For 29 bucks it's money we'll spent. Hopefully this product is durable and doesn't break down. I make an awesome bagel egg sandwich with this thing. I can do it without dirtying pans utensils, great for the lazy guy like me.Edit oct 18I don't know who in my household used a utensil to get out their egg but the Teflon was scratched and then started peeling. I'm pretty sure this is an operator error situation and have instructed everyone to always use a non stick spray-no butter- and be careful. Since everyone uses this now I had to search for a replacement part. I found it on a westbend website and ordered 2 new egg poaching trays. They were 5 dollars each...great! But S/H was 7.95. As much as we use this it was well worth the cost. If I was the only one using this egg machine this would not have happened. I use a spray and when done I immediately clean it"
3,Great while it lasted,"Had this toaster for 5 years. About 2 years ago the egg part quit heating, so we used it as a toaster until a couple weeks ago when the toaster part quit heating. We really liked it when it worked. It made a great breakfast sandwich, and it was fast and easy to use."
2,Second one just died the same death...,"I have now purchased two of these toasters. I loved the first one but the ""egg"" portion stopped working after about 3 months (the element will not heat). Optimistic, I purchased a second one only to have the exact same problem after 4 months. Now I have $70 in two toasters.... not good.Great when its working, unfortunately a %100 fail rate in my experience."
4,I'm with the majority here,"Started out skeptical, but bought it based on the reviews. It's great, and the eggs come out wonderful! I actually don't like eggs very much, but I like them this way quite a bit.The egg pan sticks more than I thought it would, I will try a tiny bit of butter next time, since someone said it worked for them.There are endless combinations for this quick and easy machine...I love it!"
1,Great while it worked,"We really liked this product for the 3 weeks that it worked. If your anything like me, You lost the recept almost before you unpackaged it so it wasn't worth the hassle of sending it back. Any way, the egg poacher just suddenly stopped working, and the toaster is slow and uneven, so the machine is not worth keeping if the poacher does not work"
2,Too bad it's useless after only a few uses,"This toaster is really cool. It works the way it should and is a fun non-messy alternative for a quick breakfast. Unfortunately, after only five or so uses (well, okay ten because we make two at a time), my husband was wiping out the egg pan with a sponge and the tephlon just peeled right off. The tephlon that's left is all bubbled up around the edge of the pan making the egg poacher useless. Now it is just a big black two-slice toaster. :("
3,Possible fire hazard....,"We have used this toaster for about a year and a half. The first year was great. It worked as advertised (although we rarely used the egg poacher). In the last six months, I noticed it only toasted on one side of the toast. Still worked though, we just turned the toast around to toast the other side.Then today, I was coming out of the shower and I heard a buzzing noise coming from the toaster. It was plugged in, but was turned off. I immediately unplugged the toaster, and smelled a burning smell coming from the toaster. The egg poacher was heating up (without being selected). Obviously, a short circuit. I searched online for similar problems and found one. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arml6_So7tQ) I think this was a great toaster while it lasted, but I would recommend keeping it unplugged when not in use."
5,I love this toaster,This toaster makes wonderful poached and hard boiled eggs so easy. It will make the eggs and toast all at once. It keeps the bread warm til the egg is done. You can hard boil up to 4 eggs at once and they come out perfect. I love it.
5,Love my toaster/poacher!,"This product is wonderful for toasting breads, making poached eggs and making hard boiled eggs - all while heating up some meat too! It has some kind of smart technology to where when you insert some bread, insert some egg(s) and lay some meat on the tray to warm up - you hit ON and it will toast at the speed of the cooking egg! That way it's all done at the same time. We just love it."
2,Great while it works!,"I loved the idea of this so much that we got one for Christmas last year. I got rid of my very expensive stainless steel extra wide toaster in leiu of acquiring my new ""breakfast machine"". Less than a year later and the egg poacher doesn't heat up. My sister also bought one around the same time and hers just stopped working last week.It works beautifully while it lasts, unfortunately, it seems to have a very short lifespan. Buyer beware!"
1,Egg sidecar never worked- No company warranty support,"Product arrived dysfunctional.Toaster would toast bagel/toast, but the side egg element wouldn't heat (not even a few degrees); the egg element was lifeless.Contacted Back to Basics' customer support, gave them the sticker number from the bottom of the toaster, and their response was that it was manufactured too long ago for them to honor the warranty. I have had it altogether now less than four months- tried to return it immediately. Ordered it December '08, product was manufactured August '06...I will, of course, never buy a product from Back to Basics or its parent company (Focus Electrics) holdings (Back to Basics, West Bend). I strongly suggest you to do the same. They hot potato you a shoddy product, sold knowingly without any sort of warranty whatsoever."
2,"Loved it, then it quit","This toaster is ingenious. As long as it worked, the eggs it produced were simply perfect - perfect boiled eggs every time, and lucious poached eggs, all timed to come up at the exact same time as the toast... Then the egg part stopped working - we'd probably had it a little over a year. We kept it around as a toaster - it's never been a great toaster - you always need to stick the english muffins in twice to get them brown, even at the highest setting, but it's all right. Now last weekend, the toaster quit, too. Toasters are fairly simple; it shouldn't be necessary for them to just up and die one day. I miss this thing, but I think next I'll get the two things separately, or spend a little more on a better brand that won't end up in a landfill after 2 years."
2,Great Idea but Issue with Teflon Coating,"I've had this product for 2+ years and it's a great toaster, but the egg compartment's teflon failed within a month (so only 2 stars). Unfortunately, I found that out when the egg I was eating tasted particularly rich in metals & minerals. Yuk! The teflon flaked - I could never get it all the way off, so I just gave up. I use it as a toaster and it is fine. I recently got tired of it taking up so much counter space and purchased a new Hamilton Beach toaster only to have the new one fail within 6 months. So, I'm back to this one. At least it toasts!"
2,Good....while it lasted.,"Sadly, the egg cooker part on mine has died. The unit is about 18 months old. And now, an open letter:Dear Back-to-Basics,How 'bout you stop contracting with the cheapest component suppliers and manufacturers? I will gladly pay extra for quality and durability. The low price I paid for my dead unit was, in the end, falsely economical."
2,Worked...ok...for 1 year....then didn't work at all,"This thing worked OK for about a year. The toasting was not too great. After about a year's worth of use, it didn't toast at all anymore."
1,Works great while it lasts.,"I bought one of these last year for Father's Day. It worked great for about 11 months. Now it only toasts, nothing else.So now I have an expensive toaster that doesn't even brown the toast on both sides."
3,Eggs too hard,"I really love the way this toaster looks in my kitchen, but I'm not as happy with the outcome of the eggs. The toast comes out perfectly, but no matter what I do, the egg is always the same - hard yoke. The amount of water put in the tray is supposed to determine the outcome of the yoke, and I have tried all different measurements. But, the yoke is still hard. It is a pretty nifty thing, though, and I have made some good egg, ham and cheese breakfast sandwiches on an English muffin. Most of the time, however, I just use it for the toast."
3,egg and muffin toaster and egg poucher.,"The egg poacher works well, however when I use the toast and egg icon, the bread doesn't toast. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I think I used it according to the instructions. All in all, I do get a nice poached egg but have to separately toast the bread."
4,Best toaster in years.,"Like many folks, I enjoy an English muffin breakfast sandwich a couple of times per week. I had been cooking the egg in the microwave, which works fine, once you figure out how to cook it (for my microwave it's 2:30 at power level 3). However, this toaster does it all at once in one gizmo and it somehow times the egg and muffin to be ready at the same time. Pretty smart. The other thing I like about the toaster is that, unlike every other toaster I've ever had, it will toast a roll (left over from last night's dinner) without burning it. I'd buy one again in a heartbeat."
2,"It does toast, but the egg cooker is very cheaply made.","This toaster is great at making toast or bagels but the egg side is coated in very cheap teflon which comes off within a couple of months. I would definitely not buy this again. It's a great idea, but someone in quality control should be shot."
3,"Great Egg/Muffin Maker, Terrible for Boiled Egg","Purchased this 3 months ago and tried out all its features. It makes great egg/muffins though sometimes you have to watch how much water goes in to make sure the egg gets cooked all the way through. For some reason 2 Tb doesn't always do the job. It makes for an average toaster, sometimes too light, sometimes too dark, but that is the way it is with most toasters. I tried to make four boiled eggs and that ended up a disaster with a mess to clean up. The eggs boiled out of the hole in the top and down into the burner. I have yet to find an egg cooker that boils eggs correctly. Just stick to a pot. If you're looking for an egg/muffin maker then this is a good buy, but don't look to its other features as anything great."
1,Was good while it lasted (Didn't last very long),"Toasting bread, heating up canadian bacon, and poaching eggs are all things it did well. However the heating element for the eggs stopped working in 2 weeks. Extremely dissapointed."
2,"Great idea, but didn't last long","I loved it while it lasted, but it didn't last long. First the egg part went out, then a few months later the toaster part went out. Mine lasted longer than my brother's, sister's, and my parents. Their egg cookers went out REALLY fast."
3,toaster/egg poacher,"great product. love that is has double feature.It's a little hard for storage in the space i have, but have made adjustments."
4,quick breakfast,This is a great in the morning product. Everyone always says they do not have time for breakfast. Well here ya go.
3,It worked! Then it didn't....,"My husband and I loved this appliance at first! It was nice that you could just put everything in and it would all come out at the same time. We used it pretty often at first. It didn't take too long before the ""nonstick"" surface started peeling and flaking off. (The nonstick surface needed to be sprayed with cooking spray anyway.) Then eventually just used it for toast most of the time because of the black nonstick tephlon-like stuff pealing off in little flakes EVERY time. Now it's been two years and we used it the most in the first 6 months with occasional use after for hardboiled eggs.Now, the egg part of the toaster doesn't work at all. It won't even turn on. So we have a toaster that's bigger and slower than it should be, and the egg part is just taking up space.At first we loved it, but now we are very disappointed that it didn't last too long. We'll probably just toss it, and get a different brand entirely."
2,"I loved it, and it Died.......","I had one of these, scratch that, I had 3 of these... It was great, at first. The hard boiled eggs boil over no matter how much water you use which is gross but it's easy and they cook really well. The rest was so easy to work with. I got Soysauge and eggs and english muffins and had breakfast ready in a snap. The first one I got lasted 2 weeks, and then would no longer toast (that's the downfall, the toaster is not great) then we replaced, that one worked for 3 months and then the eggs would no longer cook which is even worse when expecting a hard boiled egg!! The third lasted about the same time. 3 months, I've given up on them. I hope somene has better luck, it's a great overall idea."
2,Great until the paint burns off the egg boiler,"Works great until the paint burns off the egg boiler tray then its a mess and not worth having.the boiler pan should have been stainless steel, not painted metal."
4,I love it!,"I use this every morning before work. It's fast, easy, and works just like the add says. Only thing that I don't like is that it leaves water on the egg when done cooking it, But I just use a paper towel to dry it off. Also it seems like I have to push the lever down a few times before it catches. Besides those few things, I definately am happy with the product and recommend it."
5,The great toaster-poacher,"I bought the ""Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher"" for my daughter's birthday. At least once a week she tells me about another recipe she tried with poached eggs. The eggs and toast, or muffin, are done at the same time, no waiting for one to get done while the other gets cold. Now I'm going to buy one for myself."
3,Breakfast on a Bun,"After visiting relatives for the holidays who had one of these on their counter, my husband thought we should get one of our own. I purchased this toaster with the full intention that I would rise and shine and make breakfast sandwiches every am before heading to work. The only thing that is a con about this toaster is that you have to use a fair amount of PAM or cooking spray to make sure the poached eggs don't end up a crusted sticky mess.I like that you can steam the ham or bacon (precooked) in the container where the egg is cooked and it times the toast to pop out when the egg is done."
5,best purchase this year,I'm enjoying this product immensely. I am able to create healthy breakfasts with minimal effort. Excellent product.
5,Great Machine,"I bought this toaster after having seen it reviewed from another site. I decided what the heck, the price was reasonable and I had been wanting a new toaster. This product works exactly as promised. It cooks regular eggs or egg beaters, warms the meat, toasts the bread and is really easy to clean. I like to put everything in, get it started and get ready for work. When I am done, so is my breakfast. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick easy way to make a breakfast and save time too."
4,"Works, but is a little cheesy.","I have had this toaster for over 5 years now and its still working. I dont use it too often, but when I do, it serves its purpose. Ive only used the eat and meat cooking side a couple times as I was never really fond of a steam cooked eat. Makes the egg very rubbery like jello and I just dont like them that way. The toaster portion gives an even enough toast and like I said after 5 years its still working. Cant go wrong for the $29 I paid for it."
4,Satisfied,"I needed a new toaster and ran across the Egg-&-Muffin 2 Slice Toaster. Thought it was rather a novel stlye and decided to buy it. I have used it three times for making Egg Mc Muffins and used link sausages and cut them in half. Patties would be better. It does toast just bread good as well. So far, I am very satisfied with it. I would recommend it to friends."
2,"Ok, but not great quality","I've now had this toaster for three years and I've only used the egg feature twice. Both times that I used it, the egg turned out weird. It was too wet and puffed up to an extreme size.The actual toaster portion has always been ok, but in the past few months it's turned basically worthless. For example, this morning I put in my Toaster Strudel on the highest setting and it came out still mostly frozen in the middle. The outside, however, was a nice crispy/warm brown so if I would re-insert the Toaster Strudel the outside would end up burning. I've also tried cooking the Toaster Strudel at back-to-back medium settings but it doesn't help, either.I'm definitely going to be shopping for a new toaster this weekend."
2,"Good for 1 year, broke now",I loved this toaster for a year but now the egg part doesnt work.I dont want to spend $60 for another but it was great while it lasted.
1,doesn't toast,Seemed like just the thing when I bought it and it will do the egg thing but only warms the bread (even if I put it down twice) and I wanted toast!
1,Poacher unpredictable,"Toaster phase works good, but unable to produce a poached egg the way I want it. Fairly firm white with a somewhat runny yolk. No matter how I change the water level, the yolk always finishes as a nearly hard boild yolk. Frustrating."
1,Sorry...keep on shopping for something else...,I went through 2 of these losers. They are poorly constructed. My last one died after 1.5 year of light use.
3,Egg muffin,"The breakfast toaster definitely works and it toasts well. but i would say that the eggs come out a little messy mainly because they are steamed so the water gets in the egg and its watery, i mean the egg is cooked but there is water and the water needs to be strained. Other than that the eggs do come out very tasty and the sandwiches are good. The only other thing is that egg residue gets inside where you would put the water to steam and it does need to be cleaned out with a sponge which can be annoying. But its a pretty fun gadget to have at home. A major plus though is that it makes hard boiled eggs which is really great because usually boiling eggs is a really big chore and they come out perfect almost everytime. I would say that after a month or so the making breakfast sandwhich part will get old and you probably wont do it very often but it is still a good toaster and hard egg maker and doing those two things are much cleaner and requires little to no cleaning afterwards."
3,Mini Review for Each Use,"I'm still deciding whether i actually like this or just think its fun. Its definitely not idiot proof, meaning that if you don't follow the directions it won't work out very well for you. The Egg cooker requires water, too much water overcooks, not enough water under-cooks.1st use -I pressed the egg button just to see what happens, started to give off a bit of a burning-plastic scent. I didn't mind, my girlfriend did. I put toast in, switched to toast only and it worked fine.2nd use -After reading the instructions, i find out you're supposed to add 2 tablespoons of water per egg, then it steams the egg. After the water runs out, it shuts off. It doesn't really know if the egg is done or not, it knows when there is or isn't water. I didn't like this as much, because you have to be precise with water. if a friend or relative comes over for breakfast, i still might not use this.3rd use -Coming soon..."
2,Great idea disappointing performance,"At last the search for the perfect egg poacher and toaster was going to be over. Well not so. First while the idea is so appealing that I was willing to cut the devise a good deal of slack an attribute the disappointing results to my mistakes! I found over time that it was not me but the devise.In my world, toast should be golden equally on both sides my experience with this toasters was one side done and the other too pale.Secondly the first three eggs that I tried to poach were to rubbery or to runny.The buttons on the front are nice, because you can push to toaster down again and then just push the cancel button to get it to pop up.The devise also takes up a good deal of room on the counter and to work with in at least in my space I have to pull it out and turn it cross wise. Back to the drawing board in my opinion."
1,great until it broke....,"I absolutely loved this egg and muffin toaster until after only one and a half years of using it (only about once a month), the toaster and egg poacher stopped heating. I really expected it to last longer, especially since I rarely used it."
3,Great! ...While it lasted.,"Like many others here, I enjoyed the product until the heating element for the egg poacher stopped working. I had it for a little over two years, while using the product(maybe)once a week(on average...single usage). Also, as others mentioned, the non-stick surface for the egg-tray....did just that...it didn't stick to the tray shortly after purchase....for those squeamish about such things you may want to steer clear of this product unless you can come up with a safer tray substitute, or replace($5....if still available from mfg.)periodically."
5,Quick breakfast,This egg cooker and toaster was easy to use and clean. reduced time for breakfast by over 10 minutes.
1,Great idea; poor execution,"This little gizmo made a perfect egg sandwich exactly twice and then the toaster went south. I like my toast brown on both sides so it went back. I'd think twice before buying this device, though it may just be a short-term quality control issue. If you do get it, save the packaging."
2,Stopped working after about 15 uses.,After about 15 uses it stopped making toast. So now it's an egg poacher. The whole thing about it that used to be cool was that it would make the toast and the egg finish at the same time. While it worked it was pretty great.
3,This product works fine.,"It arrived on time. This product works fine and does what is expected. It does, however take a while for the egg to cook."
1,FIRE HAZARD!,"This appliance should be banned from the market. I found it to be dangerous and extremely disappointing. The egg cooker part works ok if you enjoy having water next to electric, certainly not for a younger person to be using.The toaster part is horrible. You cannot manually stop the toaster. I came into the kitchen to see black smoke coming from it as it kept burning the toast. I tried to pop up the toast to get it out and the button won't allow you to do that. By the time I did get the toast out it was practically on fire.We no longer use this piece of trash.PLEASE think about this purchase before making it."
1,POS,can only cook 1 egg every housr b/c the damn self timer. b/c of this after one egg is done u cant quickly add another b/c it will shut itself off right away. POS dont buy it
2,Sizzling,"We received this product for our wedding about a year ago. Yesterday I put in a piece of toast, as I always do, and went to get ready for work. Several minutes later the fire alarm was sounding and the kitchen was filled with smoke. The toaster had short circuited or something and never released the piece of toast. It worked fine for the year we used it, but it was not worth the awful smell in our house and the cost of having to replace it."
2,Over Hyped,"Honestly, this product is definitely overhyped. The egg tray is difficult to clean if it gets dirty, and the design just isn't very seamless. The extra pieces are stored oddly. I'd prefer a traditional toaster. Also, when I have used the egg feature, even using the proper measurements the eggs have been under-cooked."
2,"Great....until ""Eggstinction"" struck!","Everything worked great on this interesting little device for about a year, then the egg cooker just stopped working. It's like the heating element in that part went out. And I only used that part of the machine about 10 times. Bummer.I kept it simply for the toaster because that part still worked, but that kind of defeats the purpose of buying it in the first place. No more egg sandwiches for me!I thought about replacing it with another, but why? I think I will just buy a regular toaster next time because that's all this device ended up being. It's still on my kitchen counter now, and it stands as a constant reminder of a great idea that didn't really pan out. lolNot worth re-purchasing.Happy hunting!"
4,Very glad I purchased,"We purchased this toaster for work so we could have toast and eggs and Im really glad we did. You can toast bread, cook eggs and warm meat. I have been making delicious breakfast sandwiches. My only regret is that I didn't buy the one where you can make 2 eggs."
5,SO. EFFING. GOOD,"I cannot say how lazy I am when it comes to making breakfast. I hate it, I dread it, and I just can't stand it. This little gadget has saved me time in energy that I could use sleeping instead. The little sandwiches this baby makes are quick, easy and oh good. Def a well made and smart product. LOVE!"
3,after one year of use,"I've had this for about a year and use it every morning.After several months the non-stick surface started to peel away.a few months later the plastic section that the non-stick pan fits in began cracking and has now completely fallen apart. I had to resort to electrical tape to hold it together.The non-stick surface is so bad I have to remove the loose particles with steel wool and at this point I just don't think its safe to eat anything off it.Oh, and the spring that lifts the toast got so weak I now have to dig in there to get the muffin out.Hey guess what...made in China...Can someone please make a quality version of this product?"
3,"worked ok, but didn't last long...","It was fun while it worked, but it didn't last long. The egg poacher part stopped working after just a month or two. The toaster lasted about year."
2,Disposable,"Great product while it lasts. I've had two of these and both conked out short of one year--egg doesn't cook right, etc."
4,Amazing Product,"This is a great product that really works and is surprisingly well made. One thing I will say is that the toast adjustment is a little on the lighter side so if you like your toast really dark, you may have to run it through twice. Making each feature operate independently or together was a smart move too. Great item!"
2,Really good toaster...egg cooker is questionable,"I wasn't sure about this when I saw it in the store, so I looked on Amazon.com. I figured all the positive reviews couldn't be wrong, and they weren't! I love it. The poached eggs come out perfect...better than I ever did in traditional poachers, plus it is easy to clean. I don't really care for the way it boils the eggs, though, because when I tried it, the eggs cracked. Also, I wish there was a timer that went off when the egg is done. If you aren't paying attention you may not notice that it is done right away. Even with my minor complaints, I LOVE this toaster!Just over 2 years later...the egg cooker no longer works! Now I have a big awkward toaster sitting on my counter :( I don't know exactly when or how it broke. I hadn't used it in a while and when I went to use it again, it just didn't work."
5,No more Cornflakes for breakfast,This thing is amazing. It really works. It's super-easy to cleanup and I have not had a friend see what it can do who has not purchased one for themselves immediately. I have been using egg beaters and so can even feel good about the cholesterol intake. I have to admit that the sandwiches with real eggs taste better though.
5,Love this toaster !,I bought this toaster and use it quite often. The poached eggs come out great and the toast is timed to be done exactly when the eggs are done. Easy clean up and no mess. It's also light weight and hip looking.
2,Would be perfect without the Teflon,"I admit - this appliance actually ended being a real time saver in the morning. It was very easy to use and make perfect breakfast sandwiches. However, the teflon is a serious health concern, and as others have mentioned, will flake off. For my family's health, this is unacceptable. Please re-manufacture with safe materials (I know easier said that done - just like all the Made in China complaints)!"
1,Awful quality toaster,"Received this toaster as a christmas gift last year. Within the first thirty days it had completely failed. Now, to give credit to the manufacturer, they shipped us a new one and we didn't even have to ship the old one in. They just sent the new one. But this should have been the indication that all wasn't well. The second one only cooked three or four eggs before the egg cooking portion quit working. We didn't try to warranty it again because we decided it wasn't worth it. Just last week, however, it also quit making toast and went in the trash. Be aware -- you aren't getting a good device here."
2,It was great...until it died.,"I bought this toaster a few years ago based on the great reviews. It toasted bread really well (didn't really care for the egg poacher) for about a year and a half until it suddenly stopped working. I'm still not really sure what happened since I only used it about once a week at most. I ended up getting rid of it, unfortunately."
2,A Good Toaster But Doesn't Last,"This is handy to have for a quick breakfast but honestly it will only last a year tops. We have had three of these. I can't find anything else that can fix the egg, sausage and toast or biscuit all at once in one machine."
1,Don't believe warranty,Let me echo what so many others have said: This product works fine for a short time but fails far too soon. Repeated attempts to contact for warranty service are not returned. Do not take the chance; you'll be wasting your money.
2,The best appliance I ever owned... but only for about 10 minutes.,"When I first used this toaster, I was so happy that I would have given it 20 stars. It did a fantastic job. However, the next morning, I went to use it and only the toaster part would work. I did nothing rough to this appliance-- and it seems sturdy enough. Yet it no longer works. I am rather disappointed. Oh well, it still toasts bread... which I guess is what a toaster is really supposed to do anyway."
2,AWESOME....then it will break.,"I really enjoyed this product... while it lasted. Sadly the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" applies. It lasted for 7 glorious egg mc muffin-like months THEN it just stopped working. The warranty had expired and I could no longer enjoy the egg goodness. I thought it was unusual and possibly a fluke but after some research I found out that this products failure is quite common. I contacted the company to no avail they did/would not reply. SO in conclusion, great idea, terrible implementation. Oh and USE NON-STICK SPRAY! The low price clearly does not allow for teflon."
1,Down with this toaster and egg poacher!!!,"the unit worked fine for the first month....then, out of nowhere, the egg poacher part just stopped working.....i only used the unit 3 times before it broke...it was fine until that point..."
4,quick breakfast,"Mornings at our house are a complete blur and anything to help is welcomed - that's why I ordered this kitchen gadget. If you prepare your ingredients first then start both your coffee maker and muffin maker both are complete about the same time. My 12 and 8 year old can it as well.Only two dislikes, one watch out for the steam and two cleaning the ""boiler"" is not as easy as I'd like but not too difficult.Tastes like McDonalds! You can also hard boil up to four eggs at a time."
1,Close but no cigar,"We are now preparing to send the second Egg N' Muffin Toaster back to Amazon. The first one stopped poaching eggs after just 5 days. Amazon replaced it quickly with no questions asked. The replacement arrived in three days by FedEx. Right out of the box, the egg portion of the machine once again did not work... not even once. After going through the accompanying manual thoroughly to make sure it was not ""operator error"", I'm preparing to box this up and get a refund, not a replacement. I am puzzled by the five-star reviews here and wish I could have had the same experience. I think this is a great idea for a toaster, but not when it just doesn't work."
1,Short life span,"The toaster did what toasters do with the caveat that it did it for only twenty-one months. No rhyme, no reason - it just stopped doing what it was built to do."
1,Disappointing,I love the idea of the muffin/egg breakfast however this item just does not live up to its hype. I have (sadly) purchased 3 of these. And each of them has stopped working within 3 months of purchase. 2 of them the egg cup stopped working and the last the toaster will not work. Sorry - much as I enjoy my egg sandwiches cannot recommend this item.
3,Do keep it unplugged!!!,"The manual recommends keeping the unit unplugged when not in use, which at first sounds like liability mitigation by the manufacturer. However, checking the unit with a wattmeter shows that it uses 8 watts just sitting there, which corresponds to ~70 kWh/yr! For comparison, a reasonable refrigerator now uses <500 kWh/yr, so it's easy to understand the waste of keeping it plugged in.I'm on my second unit, with the first unit's egg cooker dying like many others have reported. The first unit wouldn't toast sufficiently even on the darkest setting, but the second one will at only 75%. Both units toast better on one side and on the bottom.Still, being able to hard boil eggs without having to set and mind a timer is safe and convenient."
4,"Awesome, but problem with teflon coating","I love how this makes an awesome egg muffin sandwich every time. Simple to use and clean. However, I have had to return FOUR of them so far due to the teflon coating peeling off. However, spraying cooking oil in the BOTTOM tray as well as the egg poaching tray does seem to help prevent or delay this issue. Why don't they just make it stainless steel or something? Teflon has only come off while cleaning, and not onto the egg so far."
4,Breakfast Maker Review,"This is a good product. It provides a quick and easy, on-the-go meal with a minimum of prep and cleanup. The 4-egg hardboil feature works perfectly. Its great for a single serving sandwich/meal."
5,Best kitchen gadget!!!,"I use this almost everyday! It's the best kitchen appliance I have. I don't really use the meat heater just because it creates more moisture, but it doesn't effect the number of stars I give this wonderful creation! I've had it for about a year and half... it's great!Update!It's now Oct. 2011 and I still use this thing like crazy! I did however stop using the meat tray all together just because it often created too much moisture while steaming the egg and the egg would cook more and since I like my yolks runny I didn't bother trying to figure out the water ratio to the kind of meat being used since the frozen sausage patties have more moisture than Canadian bacon and what not. It's just easier for me to toss the meats in the microwave. I originally bought this March 5, 2008."
2,Great invention; poor quality...,"Bought the first one in 2005, worked well, died in 2007. Bought the 2nd unit right after, worked well again, died again last month... This is such a great product but I guess its life is just less than 2 years... We ended up buying cuisinart's toaster AND egg cooker as both of them are of higher quality..."
5,Love this Egg/Muffin toaster,"I purchased this item on sale, even though I am still using my first one and have been for 2 years, I wanted one as a backup so I won't be without one if the first toaster gets too old and eventually fails. Also, I love the convenience of hard boiling 4 eggs to have on hand for a snack or salad etc. I love this toaster."
4,Egg Sandwich Maker,Actually the product does exactly what it says it does. The only thing that might be a disappointment is that the pan for the egg isn't non-stick. One might think the manufacturer would have splurged a few extra cents to make sure the consumer doesn't have to reach for non-stick spray. Otherwise no complaints.
5,BREAKFAST AT HOME,"This is a wonderful appliance that makes great tasting ham (Canadian bacon)/egg/muffin breakfast sandwiches. We don't eat bacon, but the booklet says it can be used as well. Once everything is done we put a slice of cheese on when we assemble the sandwich."
4,Very Handy,"Pros: Very handy, the eggs turn out perfect. Not too firm, not to soft. Everything finishes at once and is very hot!Cons: As a stand alone toaster, it's awful. Takes too long, and doesn't brown very well.Overall: I recommend this for a sandwich making unit. It's fast, easy to use, and easy to clean."
1,Twice burned,"My husband loves his egg and muffins, they are easy to make and a good weekend treat. The egg part only gets used on weekends, the toaster a little more often.When our first egg poacher burned out after about eighteen months, we decided it was worth replacing. Our second model has lasted exactly one year, at this rate we would be lucky to get six months out of another one. We have decided not to replace it. We will go back to making our egg mcmuffins the old fashioned way, in the trusty microwave."
1,"Great at first, until it stopped working!","I loved this toaster at first and thought it was a great idea, but the whole thing has since stopped working a year later. The egg cooker part stopped working one day, and the toaster lasted a little longer but recently gave out as well. Very, very disapointing."
3,Great until it breaks,"Like many others who reviewed this product here, I got this and loved it. And then I woke up one day and went to make my egg and the poacher was no longer working. Until it stopped working, it was a terrific product--the eggs would always cook exactly as I wanted, it was quick and easy and ""idiot-proof."" The toaster side still works perfectly, so I'm not planning on replacing it yet, but I would hesitate to recommend this product to someone when there's clearly a problem with the design--I'm sure there are many more people than those who write reviews that have experienced the same issue."
5,Great,"This replace a 2 year old one that was used 5 days a week, and the price is cheeper 2 years later"
1,ANOTHER EGG COOKER BITES THE DUST,THE SAME PROBLEM MANY OTHERS ARE EXPERIENCING! THE EGG COOKER TRAY PEELS AND WILL NOT HEAT UP. I EMAILED SERVICE @ BACK TO BASICS TO SEE IF THEY SELL REPAIR PARTS TO REPAIR UNITS AND I DID NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE ISN'T THAT GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE? DO NOT BUY MULTIPLES OF THESE UNITS; THEY COMPARE TO THE 19.2 VOLT C3 CRAFTSMAN WORKLIGHT BULBS(WORTHLESS!)
5,I love this thing.,"As a huge fan of delicious egg and english muffin sandwiches this little number is made for me. Very easy to use, simple instructions, delicious results. I've only used it a few times, so I'm not sure about it's longevity but so far so god."
5,works great,Got this for my son in college. He loves it. It works very well with easy clean up. Great for his dorm room.
5,Dorm Essential,"I bought this after reading other Amazon reviews. My daughter hates the dorm food and needed to eat some healthy food. This proved to be just the ticket. Although toasters are not technically allowed, this toaster has provided a quick source of food. It is both easy to use and easy to clean. I would never have thought of this item had I not read other reviews. I think the ""Back to Basics"" name is a misnomer as we definitely had nothing like this when I was a college student."
5,Great Product,"Awesome toaster! Makes egg sandwhiches in minutes. We use ours every single day, and not one problem or negative thing about it. I would recommend this to everyone."
4,worth every dollar,i thought this was to good to be true but i love it have boiled eggs and made wonderful sandwiches with it very impressed saw it orig on hgtv and with 4 child thought it would be great very happy with product
4,Bought for my Mom,"I bought this as a gift for my Mother and she loves it. Uses it several times a week for english muffins, waffles, etc..."
4,Great product!,This is great for making poached eggs on toast. My family has enjoyed using it so far.
5,Great Idea! Practical and lots of fun too.,"I got the toaster from my kids and it's just great! Makes mornings a bit more fun and easier to deal with. At this price it's worth a try, we can all use a new toaster!"
5,"FAST, EASY BREAKFAST !!","I read the reviews and bought this as a mother's day gift to myself. I made breakfast for the whole family, and hard boiled eggs for a salad later. It's easier to use than I imagined, and the results are great! Try some smoked turkey in the meat tray-- it's great on eggs! I did get some meat residue cooked onto the water tray (one of my kids won't eat eggs, so the egg wasn't there to catch the juice,) but it came off easily with a damp nylon scrubber. I've tossed the old toaster in favor of this flashy-techie replacement because YES, it can just do toast if you want! Highly recommended!"
1,Poor Toaster,"i was really excited when i recieved toaster and egg poacher. Soon i found out that it was not all that great. I have a really hard time keeping the toast lever down to actually toast the bread, and when it does stay down, it pops up shortly after, not even browning the bread. (and yes i did adjust the toast level, yet nothing happened). As for the egg poacher, it does do a good job at cooking a scrambled egg, but thats it...it doesnt hard boil the eggs very well, and sadly, over all, i would not recommend this product. its too bad, because it would really help out alot."
1,The idea was fantastic... but it did not last!,"Bought it... loved it! Unfortunately it lasted about three weeks before the toaster portion stopped working. I returned it for an even exchange, and still raved about it to other customers in the store. But the second one was no different. It may have lasted a week or two longer... but the same thing happened. The toaster just stops heating.I thought this product was the greatest thing in the world. It made english muffins a snap to prepare. I just wish it could have lasted longer. I considered trying a third, but the store had completely removed this product from its shelf. Not a good sign... so I opted for a basic model instead.If they ever figure out the problem... I would definitely try it again. But for now it's a no go. It's too expensive to keep trying."
4,Busy Dude,"Get this product. Hands down its a time and money saver. I used to spend a couple bucks a day on Egg McMuffin sandwiches. Within the time it takes in the drivethru I already have my breakfast made at home. Heck its acutally faster now b/c I can put this stuff together push the toast down take a shower and breakfast is done and cooled off when I am out. Buying all the stuff from the grocery is cheaper too; and better tasting. I haven't put oil in the poaching tray yet, though I do use a little cooking spray which is pretty much the same thing.The only reason I did not give this toaster 5 stars is the Beagals seem to be unevenly toasted sometimes. This morning's was perfect but sometimes the top half is toasted more than the bottom."
4,Deeeelicious Egg Sandwiches!!!,"Best. Toaster. Ever. I can't believe how easy to use this appliance is! Pop all the ingredients in, push a button, and a few minutes later breakfast is served! Dare I say better than the fast food version?!? Took one star off because the ""non-stick"" coating on the poaching tray peeled off after the 3rd use -- but it still works great with a liberal dose of cooking spray. Also agree with the poster who commented on the sausage dripping on to the egg below. I find it easier just to microwave the meat portion and not use the heating tray. Overall, though, this product is stellar. Brag about it to all my friends and coworkers. Great Xmas gift for anyone who loves eggs!!!"
5,Updated 10/2009: This really WAS great (while is lasted)!,"I can't believe how great this toaster/egg maker really is. The egg sandwiches are so easy to make. Everything is ready at the same time and there is little clean up. You always wonder about ""gadgets"" but this one is a gem. Highly recommended!Update 10/09: Well this toaster has not turned out to be as great as I thought it would be. The egg portion worked great for a year then quit (just after the warranty expired!) Today the toaster element died. I expected to get more than 2 to 3 years out of a toaster. I will not buy this again. It was great while it worked but not worth filling up the land fills every 3 years with broken toasters. What ever happened to durability?"
1,Stopped toasting after 2 months,"I was excited about this toaster at first, until it randomly stopped toasting! The egg portion works fine, but one morning it just wouldn't toast. I also wasn't impressed w/ the hard boiled egg function. Even though I pierced the eggs according to the instructions, they still cracked and oozed outside of the shell. Boiling the eggs the old fashioned way would be much cleaner. I would NOT recommend this toaster unless you want to replace it right away."
4,Really wondered if this would work---cooking the egg and the toast at the same time---and it does!,Follow the directions and you will have a perfect poached egg and toasted bread. We have really enjoyed cooking and eating an easy to prepare breakfast---even used it Christmas morning! It's great to find a product that does what it says it will do.
5,Amazing,I was skeptical when I purchased this for my partner. Not being the one to ever eat breakfast and then complain that he was hungry by mid morning. When he opened this on Christmas day everything stopped and this was instantly plugged in. He loves this machine and has found a variety of ways to make delightful breakfast's with it. It works fast and cleans up well and easy. It is perfect for on the go before work. I would buy another 100 of these so I could have them around for more gifts. Get one you wont be disappointed!
4,Broke after 5 months,"It worked good until it broke. Toaster lever doesn't stay down anymore. Even when I hold the lever down, it no longer heats up. They did replace it for free and the new one has worked for years."
2,First no eggs then no toast!,"This toaster operated OK for about a year. It is SLOW to toast bread even without the egg cooking on th side. Sure it is a really cool feature to be able to cook an egg on the side, but it would take me less time to get the pan out and do it the old fashioned way!3 weeks ago I tried the egg feature and it no longer worked. This week we pluged it in at our new house and while my daughter was home it started buzzing and smoking. Luckily she was there to unplug it before it burned down the new house!!"
2,not reliable!,"Broke after 6 months (egg cooker) of very light use (twice or three times a week at most)! Bulky, takes a lot of space on a kitchen counter! It was a bad decision to buy this combo. I wouldn't recommend it!"
1,Fire Hazard,The toaster and egg cooker worked as expected for just over a year. The egg cooker side gave out about 3 weeks ago. I was debating on getting a new one when last night my dog started going crazy barking at something in the kitchen. I went in and found it buzzing and smoking. It was plugged in but I was not making any toast; it was the start of an electrical fire as I could smell the electronics burning. I quickly unplugged it and put it on the back porch. The dog saved our house.I don't know if the egg cooker side giving out was a sign of its doom but I do see many people having issues with the egg cooker side going out on theirs as well. Keep it unplugged!!
4,Great value for a lot of fun!,"When I saw this toaster I thought it was really a great idea to combine toast and eggs. And of course it makes so much sense! Who doesn't want to make eggs while toasting his bread! It works well, it is very easy to use. And it looks fun too in your kitchen!"
4,Excellent product + Best Customer Care,"We got this product as a gift.In less than a year, the egg boiler stopped working, toaster is still working fine. That's why 4 stars.When it worked it worked great.The best part is when I called ""Back to basics"" customer care.They asked when did we get/bought this product (as they have 1 yr warranty), I told them when we got it and what the problem is, they shipped us a brand new replacement.Also for the old one they told us to cut the power cord and trash it, no need to ship it back.I think the metal they used in the egg boiler cup to hold the water is not good and gets rust very quickly< 1 year.I they could just use a better quality steel, this is the best product out there for what it does i.e. to boil/steam/toast.Thanks and hopefully it helps in your purchase decision."
1,Egg poacher defective after 6 months,"?Using it for more than a year now, with the egg-poacher non-functional since six months. This is definitely a great product idea, only if it was made keeping longevity in mind. The toaster part is running perfect as expected, but the egg poacher stopped working after about six months of use. And I didn't saved the receipt to be able to return it to the store. It sucks to pay $40 for this fancy poorly manufactured product when you can buy a reliable 2-slice toaster for less than $15. Hope someone in this company is reading these reviews."
3,Life expectancy is about 1 years,"Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg PoacherI purchased this Egg and Muffin toaster on Nov. 25, 2007 for a Christmas Present. This was the second Egg and Muffin toaster I purchased, the first toaster lasting almost 2 years.The one I purchased in November, the egg poacher is going out, sometime it works, sometime it doesn't. So, the toaster lasted from Dec. 25th, 2007 to May 27th, 2009.But when it works, it does a great job. Debating if I should purchase a third unit..."
4,good,Works well and saves time when in a hurry- Takes a little longer than my previous toaster and poacher but is still a good product
1,kevpan,"This one only worked for a little over a month just past return date toaster part stopped working. We bought the same one about a year ago, the steamer part was broken. So overall, this product is not durable."
4,Convenient Toaster!,"This is very convenient and easy to use. I've used it many times to make sandwiches and hardboiled eggs and both have turned out great. The only minor complaint I would have is the tray the the water goes in is difficult to keep looking good and clean. Other than that, it's been great!"
5,Good product!,"Quality toaster, easy to use, actually cooks eggs as described.Can cook one egg poached or up to four boiled."
1,Delivered broken,"I recently purchased this toaster/egg poacher and when I tried to poach an egg, the compartment wouldn't heat up. The toaster part works perfectly though. But still I really want to make egg sandwiches and I cant now D: Piece of junk!"
2,"2 health concern and one suggestion to ""Back to Basics""","Have this machine for 1 month.First, the non-stick coating on the poaching tray start to come off. I use it every morning and rinse it off under the hot water and wipe it off with damp papertowel. They shouldn't be that easy to come off. Second, the non-stick cooking oil spray are required to use the poach tray. They all contain propellant.Finally, the plastic handle on the poaching tray broke off. (my wife might dropped it, but it should be build with metal)"
2,"Ok, but has flaws","This does ok, but the little pan that you cook the egg on is so so cheap that the egg sticks to it every time and I had to scrub so hard to get it off I don't think there is any of the (very small amount) of non-stick coating on it anymore - very cheap little pan.It will also only fit one egg max, no more, which I guess you can kind of tell from the picture, but if you try to put 2 in as I did, it'll overflow...1 egg really isn't much I found out.Overall, its ok, but I wouldn't buy it again."
4,The greatest impulse purchase I ever made,"This thing is great. It takes a long time for eggamuffin to get old. This does just what it says and does it very well. My only complaint is that after lots and lots of use, the egg holder is not nearly as non-stick as it used to be. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Using just as a toaster now,"Great concept! It worked as should for about a month, but the egg/sausage portion no longer works. I still use it as a toaster since the black/silver matches my other appliances. I probably got a lemon. My other buddy has one and it's still going strong. Super convenient. Start it, take a shower, and have an egg mcmuffin when you get out."
5,Excellent results!,"You end up with a Mickey-D's-quality sandwich in about 10 minutes, including set-up and clean-up. I haven't tried the 4-egg boiler, but I imagine it would be quicker than preparing a pan, etc. The toaster works well for bread, bagels, what-have-you, and lets you get creative over and above the usual recipe. The little pans are a bit awkward to position, and it needs a holder for the little measuring cup, not to mention a cover/guard for the little spike designed to pierce the boiled eggs! Despite these tiny complaints, I love this piece!"
4,"I love, love, love it!","With any food making product, you have to try it a few times to get your settings the way you want it. I was able to make the fluffiest egg mcmuffin ever. The toaster works perfect. For the egg, I used both a scrambled jumbo egg and egg beaters. Both come out perfect. The egg can be a tad wet because of the steam but I just place it on a paper towel to take that away. I took away a star for the hard boiled egg function. While it worked, it just wasn't comparable to boiling an egg on the stove. Maybe I'll try a few more times."
1,Defective,"I purchased this item about 6 months ago. From day one the egg poacher did not work. It would not get hot. Too much of a pain to try to send back. So I had to use it just as a toaster. The toaster worked fine up until about a week ago when I tried to toast some bread and the lever would not stay down. It kept popping back up. If I kept trying it would finally stay down and toast my bread. I threw it away today because no matter how much I kept trying, the lever would not stay down. This toaster only lasted for about 6 months if you do not count the egg poacher which never worked at all. I would not recommend this item."
1,stopped working after two months,"While it worked, we like it, but after only two months it simply stopped functioning. We tried to repair it with no luck. What a waste of money. If you get this, make sure there is a return policy or a warranty"
3,Nice while it worked,"This is a fun appliance but I wish it had lasted longer. I really liked this appliance at first! It was nice that you could just put everything in and it would all come out at the same time. I used it a lot at first. It didn't take too long before the surface coating (non sticking) started peeling and flaking off. (The nonstick surface needed to be sprayed with cooking spray but it still should peel off and is probably not healthy to ingest. Eventually, just used it as a toaster most of the time because of the other problems mentioned and it became difficult to clean."
4,Love it so far,"this is a very cool thing, specially if you are an egg eater and on the go every AM. Poached and boiled eggs come out great. I heated up steak - its dripped over the eggs, and was a little messy, but I didnt mind the extra flavor. I put a little tin foil to catch the steak juice next time and it was a lot less watery on the eggs.This is a great gadget if you have teenagers in the house and are always stuggling to get them to eat in the AM before school."
4,Very nice,"I have used it twice and it performs well except for the temperature of the toast when the egg is done. The toast sits in the machine while egg finishes. It think cooking the egg first then heating the toast will fix the cold toast problem. The easy setting produced a nice runny egg, being paranoid I nuked it in the micro for 20 sec, with great taste. The next egg, I used the water measuring cup at a medium level, was not runny but the toast was sure cold with the longer sit time. I also warmed the meat on grid over the egg but it didnt fit so had to fold it. Overall, It is a nice machine and I dont regret buying it."
5,Perfect for the barracks!,"This item is great as it fits nicely on my counter and prepares my breakfast while I shower in the morning. There was some smoke the first time I used it. (That is normal, burning residue off of the heating element) Nifty device. I cook some hardboiled eggs to put in my sandwiches for lunch, and poach an egg, heat some meat, and toast my bread for a quick, easy, convenient breakfast sandwich."
2,very disappointed in Amazon.com,"We ordered 3 of these items for Christmas presents, 6 WEEKS AHEAD OF TIME, just to find that they NEVER SHOWED UP!! We were, however, charged for them promptly. Finally, two weeks before Christmas, we contacted Amazon and we were told that ""there are plenty on hand and we will have them expedited to you"". Needless to say, the next day we received an e-mail stating that they were out of these and were not able to fill our order. WHY DID IT TAKE 6 WEEKS TO LET US KNOW THIS? What a sorry way to do business. They finally did reimburse our credit card, but we were left with, yet again, a very disappointing experience with your company. We will not order from you again so please delete all our personal information from your files. Also do not pass on our information."
3,Don't like the poached tray,"Even I add non-stick spray on the poached tray, I still have trouble with this. It's sticky."
2,If I had it to do over again.......,"Product works OK, as in acceptable but not outstanding. I don't think I would buy another one."
1,Hoped it would of been better,"The first time I used it my husband didnt spray the pan for the egg and it was a nightmare, it took off all the black coating and it the pan was already ruined. the toaster part didnt impress me, it has to be all the way at the end to even toast. personally, I wouldnt buy it again"
5,Easy to use with great results,"I absolutely love mine. It's easy to use, the kids can make their own breakfast sandwiches. This is definately a keeper."
2,So-so,"The egg function stopped working after less than a year.Now about 3.5 years after buying this toaster, it takes several attempts to get it to toast. Not a terrible life span for a toaster but not impressive."
1,Very poor quality,"It is a great idea, but the quality is so poor that you should save your money. I bought one and it worked for a few months, then the toaster started buzzing and I thought it was going to start sparking. I called the company and they sent us another one, but that one stopped working after a few times. I gave up on it and tossed it into the trash."
3,Nice but did not last,"We bought our first one 5 years ago. Loved it for the first 2 years then it stopped working. It would, make toast but not cook the eggs. A year later we bought the 4 slice version and it only lasted one year. these do not seem to be well built. Really like the cooked egg mcmuffins but it just does not seem sturdy enough."
4,Best gift for my boyfriend! Easy to use :),"Pros: Very easy to use, eggs turn out great, toast is yummy!Cons: Hard to clean ( 4 on a scale to 10), Once you choose to cook the eggs with the toast, you cannot cancel one or other other ( which led to my toast burning or the eggs being underdone)All in all, if you are looking at this item you like the ease of eggs and toast. Which is exactly what it is. My boyfriend now makes me breakfast!"
1,worked great until egg pan lining started chipping off pan,Worked great until the non-stick pan lining started chipping off the pan. Purchased in Mid December and have used this appliance about 75 times for english muffins and eggs.Noticed pan lining coming off today and return date expired 1-31-2012.
2,Good...for a little while,We purchased this toaster probably two years ago and have gone through 4 units in that time. There were electrical issue where the toaster ceased working. We received a replacement toaster that had a K-Mart sticker on the box and crumbs in the bottom tray. And our latest toaster stopped toasting after about 6 months. Time to move on to a new toaster...
4,Awesome product,"Needed to get a new toaster as our older one didn't heat on one side. This was the top rated and most popular model on Amazon yet I was skeptical of getting a ""gadget"" from a company I've never heard of. I decided to trust the reviews and purchase the product.This product is absolutely great. Sandwiches are so easy to make. Hard boiled eggs without having to dirty a pot and keep a constant eye on the stove. My family loves it as well. Have had the in-laws down several times and they have breakfast sandwiches every morning.Definitely worth $30. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't have a bagel toasting feature which only toasts one side. Other than that it is a perfect addition to the kitchen. Also, make sure you put cooking spray in the egg pan. If you don't then the eggs will stick a bit."
4,Back to Basics toaster,"I've had the toaster for almost 3 years and it has worked very well. The egg cooker portion just failed today and I'm about to order another one. I have only had two complaints. The measuring cup was hard to read, but highlighting the measure points with a sharpie overcame that problem. The coating on the egg cup has worn almost all the way off over the last year even though I've been very careful. I've been on chemotherapy for the last 10 months and have experienced the associated lack of taste/appetite side effects. I've not had a problem with eating poached eggs and the toaster has been a real life saver."
5,Top 5 of all time!,"Out of my 6,800 jazz cd's.albums this ranks #4 of all time behind (1) Eberhard Weber ""Fluid Rustle"" (2) Paul Bley ""Lyrics"" (3) Jack Dejohnette ""New Directions"" .Go ahead and say this wasn't helpful but I don't have the time or the writing skills to do better."
5,AMAZING!!!!!,this should have 10 starsthis is closer to progressive rock than jazz but it is neither
5,"Great Product, Great Seller",I ordered this sword and it arrived on time and in the condition described. It goes great with my kilts. I am very pleased.
4,A worthy entry in this genre.,"An engaging story with engaging characters; good mystery; richly textured settings and enough back story so you know about the characters without having to wonder how they got there, and why. Definitely a good read."
5,A Relative Stranger,"I really enjoyed this mystery! A great whodunit! The detective, Jessica Randolph, is an independent and resourceful young woman! The twist of having an absentee father show up in the heroine's life was innovative! The story was original with many twists and had me turning the pages! A fun summertime read!"
1,I didn't like it,This book was not very good. I can see why she wont be remembered like Agatha Christie will be. It's not convincing and a silly plot. The Detective is not very likeable.
1,Terrible - That simple,This was the most disgusting novel I have ever read. It's not at all original and is not very well done. The funny thing about is that the author wrote a book on how to write mysteries. This book is a no no!!!!!!
1,A Dissapointed Reader,This book was awful. I didn't want to finish it. I can understand why it is out of print. The plot is not that good and the characters are not convincible. Margaret Lucke is a disgrace to mystery novels. A Relative Stranger is not worth buying unless you like trashy novels.
4,Very Good Workout,"I've tivo'd Gilad's current series on tv, which I love, and that's why I got this DVD. I thought that I'd be getting more of those 30 min type workouts. This is a very good workout, but sometimes it it's too long for the time I usually have available but doing even part of it is still worthwhile."
2,Same as TV,"I thought this dvd would be different than what I see on TV, sort of disappointed that I had to spend money on repeat on what is on TV."
4,Always Satisfied,I'm always satisfied with what Gilad does. He is one of my favorites because its a good workout and I can see results after about a good soild week.
2,Disappointing,"I have a couple of Gilad's older workouts on VHS and have been very satisfied. Unfortunately, this one was not up to par and as another reviewer mentioned, there was virtually no attention to the abs.I won't watch it again so I guess I'm out 15 bucks. I'll have to watch my old VHS Gilad tapes :( or gamble on another one."
4,Solid workout,"I love Gilad, but I have to say, in this dvd, he isn't as much fun as he usually is.Here is my list of Pros and Cons. PROS: It is a good solid workout, especially good for tricepts and bicepts. He is good at cueing the exercisise and showing correct form. I like using the bands with the leg exercises. He has a great exercise for the calves. Cons: NO ABDOMINAL EXERCISES in this dvd. The music is almost non-existant. If you like to work your back out (traps, lats, rear delts and rhomboids) you may find the back exercises too easy and not enough reps- I did them with both arms to make it harder. He doesn't have anyone showing modifications for absolute beginners-though the exercises are not that complicated. But overall a decent workout."
4,great but very sore,"I like this dvd a lot. It is aimed mainly at the upper body. The first part he uses a band and the second is weights. But I would recomend doing half of the workout at at time, my shoulders were sore for almost three weeks afer this workout. I would have liked the cool down or warm up to have more stretching of all the muscle groups."
5,Working It!,"This is part of set of three dvds. All excellent. This one is for scupting and uses weights and a resistance band. Don't worry, if you don't have a resistance band you can use weights instead, no biggy. Also don't count on getting your heart rate up, like I said this is a scupting workout, so consider a jog/walk on the days you use this one if you want cardio too.This is not a difficult workout, but I would suggest, expecially to beginners, to watch it first so you know what you need to do and as always with excercises watch your form so you don't injure yourself."
1,Damaged goods,"Was in the middle of working out and DVD was damaged.The workout was intense and I could tell it would give the results desired. I would recommend this DVD to all who enjoy a workout, but be careful about the seller."
1,Exercise dvd,Gilad's dvd's are very good. However this particular dvd would not play on my dvd player. Had to send it back and got a prompt response from Amazon. Got my refund in a matter of days.
2,Unhappy with product,"This purse is cute. But it is little bitty, and the picture and price made me think I was getting all three, but only one came with it."
1,Horrible fake product,"This is NOTHING like the real gel I purchase at my dentist for $25 dollars. This burned my gums, turned them white, burned my throat, and I had to take it out of my mouth after only two minutes due to the pain. This is the worst purchase I've made on amazon so far. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"
3,Space rage is all the rage,"""B"" movies don't get any better than this, that's why there's such a thing as ""A"" movies.The character of the colonel was kind of interesting... he was like an eighty-year-old Mad Max. Would've been neat if they focused on him more.The music [was bad ]. It gave the movie a [less than quality] feeling. The acting was good, considering the circumstances. Even the black guy form Married With Children was here... No Ma'am!I also recognized the other guy (he played the Governor) who was in ""The Doomsday Machine"" from Star Trek.Still you have to wonder how this movie ever got made."
5,A tale of two SICKO'S,"Very good book - equally as hard to put down, but BEWARE - This animal named Paul was a real sick bastard. It is amazing and very scary that this kind of thing goes on around us! I still can't decide If his wife Karla was as much at fault as he obviously was, for the horrendous things they did to these young girls, but she definitely deserved ATLEAST the years in prison that she was sentenced to. I think he deserved the death penalty, but unfortunatley - they don't have it in Canada. TOO BAD!"
4,Deadly Innocence,"This book shows that there are evil monsters living among us. How Karla's family could have stood behind her knowing full well what she did to her sister and other young girls. To think that she is free, married and a mother of three is frightening. The Canadian justice system is nothing but a joke. All for the criminal and to hell with the victim or victims as the case may be."
2,"long, drawn out, and borimg","This author jumps all over the place and is extremely over descriptive. Im on the 6th chapter and bored. I deeply regret this purchase. If you are interested in this case, just Google it."
2,This story hasn't been written correctly once...,Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka are without a doubt the most amoral and dreadful human beings I have EVER come accross. I have 3 different books about them but feel like the story has yet to be told as well as others have. My first exposure was through this book with all it's lurid and shocking details. After reading it several years ago I was stunned into silence for almost 10 days. I could barely speak... unable to understand how anyone could possibly sink as very low as Karly-Curls did. This book actually destroyed something in me and left me feeling indescribably different about the rest of the world. That Karla hasn't died from simple shame equates her mortal value with that of a PIG. I am ashamed to be in the same species with garbage like them. Enjoy the book.
4,Well-written if a bit protracted at the End,"Deadly Innocence is definitely worth the read especially if you are a true crime buff. I have read both this and Invisible Darkness and find that Deadly Innocence seems to tell a more unbiased and complete tale of depraved sex, psychological torture, and death. Unfortunately, no one can really explain the ""whys"" and ""what ifs."" The end featuring the trial and various psychologists views on Karla and Paul is a bit too drawn out. However, all in all, this book is worth the read."
4,Beyond Interesting,"I think the story of these two maniacs can fill a thousand books, but this one, so far, is better than the others out there. He doesn't give so much detail of their backgrounds and his buildup is very swift. I enjoyed reading this."
5,A SHOCKING & MIND NUMBING CRIME,I remember when the story had just come out and you couldn't get many of the details of the crime. This book filled in all the blanks! It is terrifying to think that a once normal teenage girl like Karla Homolka could be taken in to the murderous acts of a sick minded Paul Bernardo. I believe she had the opportunity to put a stop to it and because she didn't innocent girls including her own sister had all of their innocence taken away and their last torturous moments of life preserved on video tape. I have read numerous true crime books and this one just sticks in my mind as the most horrific account of serial crime. A must read for true crime buffs!
4,Hard to Put Down and Makes You Think About Abuse!,"I read this book last week and got online to find more books by this author, something I don't normally do. It sure has made me wonder just how Karla could be involved with the death of her own sister and other young girls and blame this all on Paul! I enjoyed the book, but it sure makes you think about the affect of abuse on a person"
1,Poor editing on Kindle,"The overall content of this book is disturbing. While reading it, I could not help but be amazed at what people can do. While the facts were all there on the case, the overall editing of the Kindle version and the organization of the book were terrible.There were many times while reading that I would have to re-read an entire paragraph a number of times just to figure out what the authors were trying to say. It seemed like the manuscript was given to a monkey to type in for the digital version and then was quickly run through a spell checker.In addition, the overall organization of the book was poor. It jumped around in years as the authors changed point of view and made it difficult to follow the chain of events.While the information on the case was interesting, I would not suggest this book to anyone planning on reading it on a Kindle. There must be better versions."
5,So far so good.,"Indeed they are big to hold but I feel like I have a good enough grip on them so I don't have to worry about dropping them. I didn't sense that they got to hot like some reviews reported. I tried the grooming attatchment that you can order seperately and it broke the first time in use so I just use the clippers w/o the attatchment and they work fine, they just shave him bare. If you have a good guiding hand, you won't have to worry about shaving too short."
5,Oster GroomMaster Professional Animal Clipper is a 5-star rating!,"This is a great product that we have been using on our Persian Cat for grooming. Very easy to use and does a great job on removing his hair that has been matted. Our does not seem to mind the humming that the clippers make, in fact it seems like a soothing effect. Great product. Great delivery."
2,QUESTION???????/,"WHY IF YOU SHOW THREE TOWELS IN THE PICS, YOU SEND ONLY ONE??? AND SAY TOWEL SET??????"
3,not robust and lenses are poor quality,The quality of the lenses are poor...the lense is not well made...the frame is made of plactic and is not robust and can be easily break. The frame should have been made using strong materials...
3,Useless,Sorry but the gravity of my mother-in law eyes did not allowed the product to be helpfull. I thought that it would help people who is with only 5% of view but unfortunatelly it was not the case.I kept the coil to offer to someone that could need.Even though thanks for your kind attention.From Brasil
5,"A facinating. funny, poignant true life dog story","Young readers will smile as Willy, a true life Chihuahua, is fitted with balloons to help him walk, then laugh as he becomes a terror on a skateboard, racing uncontrolled through the house and scattering the other pets in his wake. They will cheer for Willy and his owner when he is fitted with a tiny cart and truly becomes independent.And finally shed a tear as Willy, for the first time, is truly able to explore his world. The water color illustrations of Rhonda McHugh perfectly showcase this engageing, insightful story by Deborah Turner and Diana Mohler"
5,I don't know when I have been more touched by a book,"This book is charming, funny, sweet and most of all inspirational. This true story of a very special little dog would warm the heart of even the most life-hardened soul.I don't know when I have ever been this touched by a children's book. And here I sit, the mother of three small boys."
5,Strong and Fast,"Our choir uses an electric hole punch to put holes in the music. The old one we had finally gave out. This Paper Punch does an excellent job. It has a strong motor, it's heavy enough to stay in place, and it punches holes so fast, it's hard to believe. I'm expecting this commercial strength hole punch to last a very long time."
1,Worse Puzzle Book Ever,This is a very bad puzzle book. Most of these puzzles had nonsensical solutions. About two thirds of the puzzles had solutions that made no sense what so ever. The remainder of the puzzles were painfully easy.
1,Computers for Beginners,This product was of extremely poor quality. The visual and audio appeared to have been a copy of a copy of a copy. Don't waste your money!!!
1,Computers for Beginners,This product was of extremely poor quality. The visual and audio appeared to have been a copy of a copy!!!
4,I like it,"I watched this on my TV and it wasn't very clear, so I put it in my computer like it said to do, and it came out real clear. I could follow along with the lessons and I learned quite a bit. I also thought it was fun."
5,A family favorite,"This book is a favorite of mine and my 2 year-old daughter. It is perfect to read aloud due to the effortless rhyming in the story. The book is illustrated by children which makes each page interesting and different from the next. There is a page in the back for your child to draw their own illustration, so they too can become part of the book. I also really like that this book has a mission, and that is to make art an important part of a child's education."
5,Calling all cat and kid lovers,"""Clint The Black Cat"" is a great book for kids amd kids at heart. The text is written in a fun and lively rhyming style. It is interesting because it is based on a real cat -- his picture is in the book. The illustrations make the book even more entertaining. They were done by K-4 students at an elementary school in Nashville, TN. These drawings define and expand the text. Wow, there is even a place for the reader to draw their own picture of clint the black cat. I really liked this book. It is great for elementray kids and the young at heart and of course cat lovers of any age. Get it ... Read it ... Share it ... stir your creativity."
3,OK product,"This wheel does its job. It rolls and cuts the pasta. The handle is great, but the actual wheel is a bit shaky, it doesn't feel rugged at all, and it slightly tilts sideways while rolling. Also, the wheel could be a bit sharper."
5,Helpful,My son is a chef and he loved getting this gift from Santa. It makes the job easier so much easier.
2,For Angelica Maria Fans Only,"This out-of-print experimental CD has Ranchera versions of Angelica Maria songs. Eddie, Eddie originally had a rock & roll beat. This CD has a Ranchera version of Eddie, Eddie and it does not have the same ""magic""! This CD makes it up to us by having the original version of Ana Del Aire(the theme song from the Mexican soap opera). I remember seeing The Nobel Prize for Love(1972) on TV when I was a child. I couldn't understand a word Angelica Maria said, but I thought she was pretty and charming. I was later surprised to find out that she was born in the United States of America and spoke fluent English. TV broadcasts of Rosalinda(1999) renewed my interest in her. Maria is ""Mexico's Sweetheart"" and she does echo Sandra Dee, Suzanne Pleschette, and Doris Day. Me Quiero Casar(1967) and Romeo Contra Julieta(1968) are still quality entertainment. Angelica Maria is already a legend in Mexico."
5,A Different Side of Bill Connors - Quite Beautiful!,"Just after leaving Return to Forever and doing some sessions (most notably Stanley Clarke's s/t solo album), Bill Connors had a life altering experience. This was hearing a Julian Bream disc called ""20th Century Guitar"". In short order, Bill put down his Gibson Les Paul/Marshall amp combination and took up the acoustic guitar just about the time he inked a solo artist deal with the ECM label.What resulted was a very colorful and haunting set of original solo acoustic guitar pieces. Free of the constraints of a band, Bill is able to let forth some very colorful and dense melodic and harmonic ideas, that would find an even fuller realization on his subsequent solo disc ""Swimming With A Hole In My Body"".Very highly recommended"
2,"Great Idea, not quality product","Perhaps mine was a fluke, but the first time I used this, the handle broke off. The other side broke on the next try. Was very disappointed, but have seen a friend use a plastic version that I am currently looking for."
1,Amazing grills......but WAY over-priced covers...,"I took the advice of the review above and bought the Char-Broil 68"" (grey) cover from Lowe's for $14.99 It fits my brand new Weber Genesis Gold B like a glove (very snug due to velcro straps on bottom ends). Interior is fully lined which protects the beautiful stainless steel and the exterior is made of heavy vinyl. To pay $55 for a cover simply because it says Weber is foolish. This is a much better option. Spend the money you save on some steaks and wine."
5,perfect,Wow this grill cover is perfect. Whats to say... its a grill cover. I dont really understand the mesh window near the logo i guess it is to help it cool down if it is still warm and you want to cover it for the night? Maybe it is just so it can breath and rest with nice ventilation!!!OH man do I reccomend this grill cover if you have a Webber grill.
3,Covers it up so far,"Grill cover fits Brinkman, replacing a Sears cover of 12 years. we'll see how long this makes it without cracking/tearing through. Not enthused by the ventilation panels on the top of the cover - that's where I want it to keep the rain/snow out. Maybe the designers know something I don't about dew vaporization but the Sears cover didn't have these and worked just fine."
3,"Nice, but ...","This is a nice enough cover. But, as noted by others, the vents allow the rain in!But no one mentioned my biggest issue: the cover shrinks. When new its a nice snug fit. A couple years later its almost impossible to force it on or remove it. Had to replace our first one for that reason, now the second one is too small."
1,What the Heck?!?,"Alright, I bit the bullet and shelled out the $50 after cheap covers lasting a year at best...boy, wish I would've read the reviews first. Sure, it's a nice heavy well-fitting cover, but the vent holes are brutal. Rain goes right in and soaks the thing, which is the primary element I'd like to protect from. Guess I don't understand this at all. The only way water got in my old cover was when it got cracks, so I'm not sure why this needs vents to allow water to evaporate (unless it's for putting on hot, which is silly too...let the thing cool!). Anyway, would've been a 5-star, but gets a 1 for the completely ridiculous design flaw."
1,Not worth buying,"This $50 gas grill cover has a major design flaw. It has an open 'hole' along the top that lets rain through, which causes the grill to get soaked every time it rains (which defeats the purpose of the cover). I returned this one, and bought a less expensive one for $12 in a local department store that is *MUCH* better."
3,Grill Cover Shrunk?,The cover was good. We did have it for about 6 years but it shrunk. Really after a few years it became impossible to get this back on the grill. I don't know if that is because we covered it when the grill was hot but it did shrink. Very bothersome.
4,Weber Genesis Silver C Grill Cover,"I ordered this product from a hardware store and delivery took a very long time but, the product arrived in perfect condition. It fits perfectly and the quality is first rate. Also, after comparing several vendors, I found the price to be very competitive at around $55.00 shipped. Of course it will take much more time to assess the wear factor as it is only a month old but, so far, so good."
3,"Great Material, Great Fit... Questioning the ""Vents""","This grill cover fits my Genesis Gold B grill (2005) wonderfully. The heavy plastic material is durable. The vents are my concern. Not only does rain go through both vents, the water then drips down along the front and rear of the grill, pooling in the storage cabinet area below (which is made of coated steel on the Gold B, and will eventually corrode). Be aware of these vents before purchase-- they WILL allow water to enter. They could be better placed to prevent this from happening, but they're not. To shell out $55 for a grill cover-- designed by the manufacturer of the grill-- there is no excuse for this design ""flaw""."
2,An OK product at best,"Nyko is a good company. However, their screen protector for the PSP actually SCRATCHED the screen of my $250 PSP. Buy the Hori Screen protector instead for $5 at an EB games or a Gamestop."
4,"Good Protection, But Not The Best","I have been using this for about 3 weeks. It's a sturdy little thing and does what it says it does. It's very sturdy and hugs the PSP for dear life. Good protection for the screen. But I would've liked it more if it was in different colors, like black for example."
5,PSP armor,I really like this product. My son's last PSP was ruined when something fell onto the screen. I know having this will protect the screen.
3,"They do their job, but don't last very long","I bought my Weber Silver A about 3 years ago and these were the flavorizers that came with it. While they did their job admirably, they only lasted a pretty short time period before I had to buy new ones. I would suggest buying the stainless steel flavorizers if you have the extra coinBARS FLAVRZR SILV A SS. I am going probably going to by a more tricked out grill in the next couple of years so I went with the porcelain."
5,authentic parts,"Ordered repacement parts for our weber grill. Everything fit and works fine. Quick delivery, great price."
2,Expert only,You better have a high level of understanding the registry before buying this book. Also most of the book is geared to network administration
3,"More like ""Tweak your XP""",Professionals already knew the bulk of these tips (not hacks) and the jist of all of them is to modify your XP visually.For real hacks go look up Irongeek
4,Decent,"This isn't a book for anybody just learning how to use a computer. If you know your stuff then this book can be very helpful in getting the most out of your Windows XP Operating System. If an individual is in the market for a computer and reading this review I HIGHLY recommend that you get a computer without a Windows OS. This is especially true if you plan on doing online banking and/or shopping. Windows is the WORST OS system out there when it comes to security. I have an old e-machine, that has windows xp, which I use every now and then. That is why I own this book, but I also own a Mac. Purchase a Mac or if you really want to get serious, get something based on Linux."
1,Ok but hoppy is better,"I live in central NY. During the course of a normal winter we will normally receive over 200"" of snow. I had a hoppy brush that is very similar to this one for 6 years in this type of conditions with out any problems until the locking mechanism for the swivel head broke. I needed to replace it so I bought this brush. What a waste. We are having a very light winter this year with very light snow fall and the brush probably won't make it this season. The grip part of the handle moves while you are trying to push snow. You are watching for that and then the extender nut starts to give way and your nice long brush is back to a short brush. The nut is set up so you have locked and unlocked. On the hoppy I had it was more of a nut you could tighten right down. Overall I'm not happy with this purchase. I am estimating one year of service."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!,Wow this series is a favorite of all time for me. I hate when the second book drags threw a series but this did not disapoint! I just love the characters and the amazing abilities and changes that happen! I just truelly enjoyed these book and will give them the highest compliment I can and read them to my kids.
5,excellent for young readers,"Kate Constable has written yet another great book for young adults, as well as older adults. The Chanter of Tremaris is a great series."
4,Loved it...,"Very creepy and well written, I thought. Cary Elwes was excellent. I haven't read the book, but it is on my wishlist."
3,Well-researched but unreadable,"This is an intensive study of the excavations at Guila Naquitz, and is clearly an immensely intelligent and important piece of work. It accomplishes its goal by describing the intricacies of the evidence from the site, but unfortunately the book fails for the general reader. Even with training in anthropology this is an extremely dense work and does not lend itself to easy interpretation. But the information is detailed and well-documented if you can ever dig that deep."
3,"Girdler presents a good overview, but misses some details.","Girdler delineates the distinguishing characteristics of each model so the novice buyer can tell one from another and do some thinking about what Harley might suit him or her best. He defies Harley buyer convention in preferring function over form by rating the FXR models higher than the Softtails. He tends to ignore even glaring flaws like Sportster vibration and glosses over the INA cam bearing issue with some Evo engines. He doesn't note significant changes from year to year, such as the move from 35mm to 39mm forks on XL and FX models, the change in the clutch actuation mechanism on Big Twins, and other changes that significantly effect the performance of the bikes. He clearly loves Harleys, and that means he sometimes turns a blind eye to their faults."
4,Understandable Look at Economics,"This is a great introduction for anyone who wants to better understand basic economic theory and why it matters to individuals. Swonk first talks about her own career and how she got involved in studying economics. Then, she offers insights into why people should understand Fed policy, interest rates and world economy. This book will help people better understand what they read in the financial press and make more informed investing choices."
4,The title describes this book,"Swonk begins her story with the events of Septmeber 11, 2001, as she saw them from her perspective at the World Trade Center. Her story demonstrates her belief that economics is about much more than just about cold, hard numbers. Against the wishes of her family, she chose economics as a field and went on to become a star. As chief economist of Bank One, she is widely respected and a leader in her field. Well known as a public speaker, she has often appeared on television and her story is worth reading."
3,Off Beat Musical from the Golden Age,"It was interesting to me to hear the wonderful Julie Harris in a Musical, as well as Peter Marshall, the former game show host (who for years headed the Hollwood Squares Program)...I never knew either one could sing...also showcased were the talents of Charles Nelson Reilly, who had earlier appeared in Hello Dolly, among others...Peter Marshall has an amzing voice and performed his numbers in strong voice (I only miss her when I think of her, and others) Would recommend as a good buy!"
2,"NOT VERY GOOD, REALLY","In a nutshell: quite dull and uninteresting.The songs are all forgetable, nothing remians in your mind or heart, and the play itself seems to have been quite dull. I got bored listening to this languid, boring musical. No wonder it was a Broadway flop. I wouldn't recommend it, not even to musical fans. They'd better spend their money in something better than this."
3,Not to everyone's taste,"My particular interest is making Access work against corporate Oracle back-ends. This is not an uncommon approach these days and offers some very interesting opportunities for rapid development and ad-hoc querying. But there are a lot of challenges in getting Access to coexist with an external SQL Database. I have the impression there are a lot of secrets about how Access does its thing.Unfortunately, this book appears to emphasize using Access primarily as a back-end for VB applications employing various Microsoft objects. It goes into quite elaborate detail in this area. But it wasn't what I needed to know about. Alas."
5,Good for the beginner or experienced Access programmer,"This book is a great tool to learn all about developing applications in Access. Not only does it tell what to do, but why to do it, and in what order to do it. The Tips and Notes she adds are terrific. Being a developer herself, she walks you through the steps in designing tables, queries, forms, and reports. Additionally, there are many examples of VBA. Special note is given to developing your project and avoiding possible pitfalls for upsizing to client/server in the future. She starts with the basics and builds to advance concepts."
4,Solid disk,"Good DVD with plenty of action. Tons of jumps/air. Would have liked some more deep powder segments. Like X better, but 9 is solid."
4,Great How-to and story,"Pulling Through has 2 parts--the first part is a fictional story depicting what would most probably happen in the event of a nuclear was (a much more likely event when it was written rather than now) and the problems people might face. The second part gives very practical information on how to plan for such an event and how to make/get some very useful tools. Useful for showing what might happen in other types of disasters as well (tsunamis, etc.). Not his best work, but still a good, well-written, entertaining story-with-a-purpose."
4,Do it yourself guide.,"I liked the informational aspect of this book. There were a fair number of useful nuclear war survival tidbits. Many of the ideas implemented are the public domain work of a man named Kearny working out of the Oak Ridge National labs.The weakness - and this is just my opinion - stems from the main chracter. I just couldn't identify with him. I like my characters to be ordinary people who are forced to struggle with no special resources but their wits. This guy dives a Lotus hovercraft and lives in a virtual retreat behind a chain linked fence for heavens sake! The kid in this story was so unsympathetic I disliked him from the start.Other people love the characters, so who am I to gripe?"
2,Not Exactly the Nuclear Survival book I'd hoped for.,"This book had the potential to be one of the great post-nuclear survival books like ""Alas Babylon"" but it just did'nt measure up. The actual story was far too short and the main character was too flamboyant to be any kind of serious survivor. Who actually ownes a Cheetah and a flying or jumping amphibious car? The book had some good survival information, the last half the book was a survival/technical manual. As for exciting fiction, my 14 year old daughter can write better stories."
2,you may be served better by other books,"Much of the text appears as if the authors wanted to put information on paper and get it published, without regard to the readability or clarity of the text. The information in this text is largely good information. I have used a lot of it. However, you can get most of the same information elsewhere without having to ""read between the lines"" (and without all those damned footnotes!!). For example, a MUCH better and more comprehensive book is Programming with Data: A Guide to the S Language (1998) by Chambers (Springer): Chambers defines terms before using them, illustrates concepts with simple examples before moving to complex examples, and gives overviews of ideas prior to more extensive chapters. All of that is routinely missing in Venables and Ripley (V&R). Thus, even if you buy V&R to learn more about programming in S, it almost cannot be your sole reference, which is unfortunate and misleading given its title."
5,Dense,"This book is dense, yet it has a lot of high-level information that I could not find easily anywhere else. This is basically a programming reference for those who have experience in R and probably in some other programming language. For example, the information on loops (for, while, repeat) and their endings (next, break) is found on one page. I basically knew what these terms did from C++ and from prior use in R, but the page had all the extra detail that I had wanted to know. The section on functions is much longer but similarly pithy. At times, I wish there was more detail about easier stuff, but I'm thankful that the advanced/esoteric information is well explained. This book is a life-saver for me."
2,S Programming (Not as an introductory Text),"This text was not well suited as an introductory text. I do not recommend this text unless you have some knowledge of a high level programming language or prior experience with S plus. This text is well suited as an intermediate level text. As its title implies it is inteded for those interested in more advanced programming with the S plus language. It is hard to read and the examples are are not always clear. The authors do provide a nice comparison of how S plus and R differ. For first time users of S plus I would recommend ""The Basics of S and S-plus by Krause and Olson."
4,J Daniels did it again,"This was an excellant read!! I am a fan of J Daniels and she did not let me down. Kimberla Bacon(The Chameleon) went undercover to find out what happened to her best friend. What Kimberla did not bargin for was the surprise she got during her investigation.The writing was very detailed. It actually made you feel as though you were in the situations with the character's. This was a page turner from the very beginning. if you are looking for suspense then this is your book. If you are looking for a great read, then this is your book! Once I started reading this book it was very difficult to stop. I am waiting on the next J Daniels release. I would highly recommend this book!!"
5,Loved It,"It was like looking at a movie, excellent storyline and I loved Jacob. Kimerla on the other hand worked my last nerve sometimes with her selfish attitude, but I have to give it to her though when it came time to protect herself she was the bomb. I highly recommend this one it's a keeper. Someone need to turn this into a movie."
4,I like the music more on every listen.,"The first time I listened to this cd I remembered all of the songs I really liked in the years gone by. The great thing about this cd is that not all of the songs were huge hits since grunge squashed the metal genre. The blues songs I really like, just the right amount of Hair metal and blues mix. I think I actually like this cd more now than I would have in the late 80s or early 90s, since at that time I was more into heavier metal, but the hooks are great and the music jams nicely.If you love Hair Metal and you like Blues then this cd is a good addition to your collection.Heck if you want to just download a few of your favorites from amazon and transport your self to younger days then this will do nicely.Rock on."
3,Greatest hits 2,"Poison rocks.This cd is the greatest hits 2, featuring tracks from every album except for the most recent 'Hollyweird' which is great however it had some of the same songs as the first greatest hits cd.I believe it should've focused even more on the best tracks from the albums that came out after the first greatest hits : 'Crack a smile', 'Power to the people' and 'Hollyweird' and also the best hits from 'Native tongue' as there was only one song from that album on the first greatest hits. A combination of this album and the 'Rock champions' compilation would have been perfect."
3,"Good, but there is better!!","Everyone loves Poison...that's why they still tour, and sell records. However, for those of you who have NOT checked out Bret Michael's solo record, SONGS OF LIFE, you're missing out. Bret IS the songwriter in Poison..and you can hear that clearly on Songs of Life. As far as Poison compilation records go, 86-96 is a much better record."
3,Under Counter TV/dvd,broke and thrown away prematurely in my opinion.How can you be serious and ask people to add additional words to honest evaluations just to reach some mamby pamby parameter that you'd like to fit all of us in. We are not all liberals and actually do believe in efficiency rather than evaluating and measuring. A little too much to ask.
1,Didn¿t work at all!,"I bought 2 units of this Mouse Repeller, but it didn't make any difference at all.We still had a lot of activity going on. The best thing is to use all conventional means available to get them out of your house."
5,Outstanding Clarity,"I previously owned a Palm 105, the bottom feeder of handheld technology. I recently upgraded to the Sony Clie and it was like going from dark to light. What an amazing difference! The unit could weigh a little less, but basically it's compact and holds a tremendous amount of information. In addition, the screen is so clear and you can make the letters large enough to read in any environment. It has many bells and whistles that I haven't even discovered yet. I have a small business and this unit allows me to keep all my client information, my calendar of appointments and important information right at my fingertips. It's easy to use and better yet, easy to read and recover information you need. Thank you SONY!"
2,Sony Clie PEG,"The device was used, which I know is already stated. I liked the shipment time but wondered exactly why I purchased this item. I suppose the price should've been a little low for the quality. Keep in mind though, this product is rather obsolete."
3,Pretty cool but...,"This is my first PDA so I don't know too much except that this machine is really a computer in the palm of your hands. ...Anyway, the screen is crystal clear and quite nice. I wish the games that came on the CD rom were free if you like them you have to buy them and Sony should include a game bundle ... ... Also, the troubleshooting section in the manual seems a bit weak-only talks about sound mostly not the screen freezing up which it did, and I just hit the reset button in the back. Nevertheless, I am excited about possibly using it in the classroom to take notes (when I get good at the grafitti) instead of paper notebooks. I think I may a wish investement but time will tell....An update: the thing has a tendency to freeze any you need to reset it, also the letter keypad doesn't work right at times."
4,Clie on the Mac!,"I am finally going to buy this for my Mac, as I spoke with the MarkSpace Missing Sync people at MacWorld, and have confidence this will work for me combined with their product (which apparently comes with both OS9 and 10 versions bundled). They have a way to get the pictures from either the built-in or stick camera through iPhoto, so I guess I am all set! I am only giving it 4 stars, because Sony doesn't let Mac users know there is a way to use the Clie on the Mac, and I haven't got this set up yet. Can't wait for that Jog dial!"
3,MagicGate Scam,"I recently purchased the CLIE 665. There are many things I like about this device, but a few things I have learned since buying it that I am not happy about. I did some research before buying. I was very excited about the ability to play mp3 files and synchronize files between my computers at home, work, and the clie. What isn't widely advertised is the fact that these features don't work without the addition of a memory stick. In the case of playing music with the supplied audio player you must have a special memory stick called MagicGate. You can check the prices of these here on amazon. They are not cheap. ..."
1,Warning!,"After owning 3 Palms and one Pocket PC (... I kept dropping them), I bought but deeply regret buying a Clie. If you are a heavy user of ""tasks"" as I am, Clie's performance is so bad the PDA is unusable. When one makes any change in the task (...change date to ""tomorrow""), there is about a 5 second delay. For all the Palms this was instantaneous. Change ""priority""... same thing. Etc. This renders the Clie unusable.I will not complain about the fact the machine just flat stopped working after a month of use because I sent it in and they fixed it for free and quickly. I pointed out the above problem but they did nothing.This really disappointed me as I had previously thought well of Sony."
5,A Great PDA,"I have finally found PDA bliss. I have used a Palm xe, Palm iiic and now the Sony Clie T665. This unit is fast, good looking, and does what it should. The character recognition is much better that what I have been use to. The display resolution is simply great. I have loaded it with some of my favorite mp3 files and actually use it for listening (you need to buy a MemoryStick). I agree with some of the other reviews about the quick battery drain. But I'm at my desk most days and have purchased a charger for use in my car (not too expensive but a great life saver). The price is right at this date because the high price Palm OS5 units are coming out (too expensive for what I need). For any new PDA I immediately buy three accessories: case, screen protectors, and car charger. If you want a good solid PDA, this is a great unit."
5,an all new Gilad workout,"Gilad gives a great workout as he always does- this one is deceptively hard, the first time I did it using hand weights because it seemed too easy, and my butt and quads were sore the next day. He uses no weights or equipment, beginners need to be careful with their form because if knees are in wrong position they can get torqued. Gilad is a little less chatty than he is in his Fit TV series, and the exercises are a little different, but still fun."
4,Pretty good workout,"Good cardio, excellent workout for your lower body, all areas of your thighs and butt. Not nearly enough core work, but i don't think it is designed for that. I just do core stuff afterwards. Good for weight loss and strengthing your lower body, maintaining your core."
5,Is there a Nobel prize for fitness?,"Why becomes obsessed with exercising a few body muscles (calves and heart)as is the case with most aerobic programs, when you can exercise all moving parts. I can not speak more supportively of his video."
1,The Untruth Told,"This is so far off base from the real truths of what goes on at Oracle, I rate it very low as the author must have been influenced by Ellison and what ONLY HE believes. What is missing is that with Ellison's 'shadow management team', that was very devious from from start, they effectively destroyed one of the most successful management teams of the 90's and replaced it with the most inexperienced people possible. Additionally, Ellison continued to support Wohl even though he delivered some of the worst quality products in the industry and Ellison shipped them anyway. The most obvious statement that is way off target is when Ellison said he only lied once!! He consistently shipped products knowing there were major holes. The reality is that customers and employees do not trust or support the leadership of Oracle. A very bad sign for the future."
1,No info about his early years,I was very disappointed by this book because it has absolutely nothing about his early years. I wanted to read about what he was like growing up. Most of all I wanted to read about his early years in business and his rise to the top. Instead the author only describes Larry's business dealings around the year 2000. I didn't learn anything of value from this. I thought this book was a complete biography but it's not even a biography. I wanted to learn how a man can go from nothing to having one of the world's biggest yachts and billions of dollars. I got nothing from this book.
2,"Thrown together, poorly edited, boring read","Reading this monster of a book took a commitment - one I would like back. What is troublesome is the poor editing - repeats of entire sections, stories, calling people by pronouns before mentioning their actual names, just a lot of confusion. The book didn't flow at all, which made it difficult to get into, let alone gain an understanding of Mr. Ellison.My takeawy is that Mr. Ellison is an ass, a tough guy, a soft heart, sensual, emotional...I think you get the idea. The author seems to focus on the firing of top execs, Mr. Ellison's wealth, and his boat racing. Somehow the author completely forgets to provide an ""intimate portrait of"" BOTH Larry Ellison and Oracle."
5,Weber 9814 Gas Grill Flavorizer Bars,Stainless steel bars will last longer than plain enamel/metal bars which lasted a ling time in all kinds of weather since we leave our Weber grill outside all year. Cookung results seem to be the same.
5,Unknown Treasures Laid Bare by a Master...vive la Dimitri!!!,"I own five albums by him, each one has its quirks...songs andloops that come of left field...but after listening to the albums youalways get into the groove. With AFTER THE PLAYBOY MANSIONI was hooked from the first song, NYCE & SLO by Lil Louisto the last song the old skool R&B; groups HAROLD MELVIN& THE BLUENOTES doing DON'T LEAVE ME THIS WAY. This albumhas it all disco, afro-cuban, house, even some acid jazz moments.The variety of the music is what is the true gem.And of course it all flows into each other like honey ona hot bagel. I highly recommend this album for fans of music,especially house music lovers and those who enjoy disco.You will not be disappointed."
2,Listen before you buy!,"I don't know if I could ever stress this more strongly for a DJ set. No matter what you read here, no matter if you think you're just like the people that love these discs, do yourself a favor and give this a listen first. Based on some opinions here I thought I'd be into it, instead I couldn't even sit through the length of either CD. That's just my tastes though..."
2,Just Like The Jurassic Park Series,"...Not everyone is Sergio Leone (director), comparing to cinema world. I would not buy this CD even if it cost [a lot less]. My policy on buying CD's is: ""Buy only CD if it contains over 80 percent of good tones.""Just a warning, please listen to it first. Your expectation from previous album may mislead you.Or just read the title ""After The Playboy Mansion""; people were leaving, or the its best; some people were there listening to Dimitri and started leaving.What is next? ""Return to The Playboy Mansion""?Be honest! How often have you listened to ""A Night at The Playboy Mansion,"" more than 25 times, if not this means that there is novalues in mixing made by Dimitri.Dimitri has good songs, but sad that he can't mix."
1,HORRIBLE,"This CD is horrible. Don't buy this CD, you might think oh playboy mansion party COOL!, you're dead wrong, this cd is horrible, it might be good if you're on serious [intoxication], in which case you would love this CD it would feel like God rubbing your belly. I was thoroughly disappointed, amazon will probably filter out this this review because it is saying how horrible the item REALLY is, as opposed to those fake reviews they posted."
2,Not the same calibre as 'a night at the playboy mansion',"After listening the CD with some good expectations after the masterful 'a night at the playboy mansion', i decided to just stockpile it in my storage desk..the album lacks connections, transitions are not thoroughly thought and the tracks sound a little bit outdated.When in A night at the Playboy Mansion, Dimitri made old songs sound fresh and new, in this Album he makes the old song sound same old.my question is: why Dimitri? why?"
5,Amazing!,"I coudn't find a better word to characterize this CD/Set. Amazing! It gives the best of House, non-comercial but with funky drums and a lot of vocals, for those who like it! Besides, Dimitri from Paris is one of the best DJ's in the world, so this CD goes in count of that!Have fun listening!"
2,Only half as good...............,"After a long awaiting for this album, I finally got it in my hands and this is what I think. First of all I think its only half as good as the Night In Playboy mansion, the tracks on the uplifting selection have no logical sequence and there has been no effort to cover this up with some editing, remixing etc. When you listen to it you can feel at once the lack of structure in the mix. It has some nice tracks that are hard to find outside this collection but thats all. On the laidback mix things are not so tragic as on the uplifting mix but once again I found it nothing special.I am very suprised that Dimitri went ahead with this album, especially after releases such as A Night In The Playboy Mansion and the ""Japanese"" Salsoul Mix. This is way below his average and all of you who think that this is going to be as the first part, do listen to the tracks before you buy.Disapointed? Yes, definetely."
2,"not terrible music, but not the same class as .. at the mansion","not nearly as good as I was hoping. i'm not sure i would even define the music as part of the same genre as ""night at the playboy mansion"". much more drum and trance feel..."
2,Only half as good............,"After a long awaiting for this album, I finally got it in my hands and this is what I think.

3,Too much chaff for complete satisfaction,"...The Playboy Mansion made Dimitri on of my ""Immediate Buy"" artists and as soon as I saw that the ""Return"" was out, I bought it. It's been a disappointment because there are quite a lot of duff tracks on there. ""Return..."" contains some tracks that are old but don't sound fresh (So good so right, Nyce and Slow), some tracks that are on many other dance compilation cds (It's Yours, Never Enough) and some great new finds (Candidate for Love, Fran Mig Til Dig). It's worth buying for those new ones that I would never have found anywhere else."
1,This model DOES NOT fit Weber 9957 as described!,"I was furious to find that while I ordered Weber Model #9857 (which the Amazon description stated that ""The Manufacturer states it fits Weber Genesis Gold B #9957), A compatible Weber model #7551 was sent, which does not fit my grill at all. To me, this is false advertising, and now I am left with the headache of having to return (and not to Amazon, but to ""Polstein Home & Beyond"", who was the merchant who provided Amazon with the item).Be careful before purchasing if your grill is not listed directly in the title!"
5,excellent value,"I shopped around before buying this cover for my Weber grill. Your price was the best and it was the real deal. It is a genuine Weber cover with the logo on it, unlike other company knock-offs for equal or more money. It is a perfect fit and excellent quality."
5,Don't settle for a generic one.,It's worth the money. Fits perfectly and is extremely durable. Has two vented screens built in to prevent moisture build up.
2,Venting lets water in,"This grill cover has a long mesh vent on the front/top panel. The venting is supposed to let trapped moisture out, but the vent is what lets the moisture in in the first place. When it rains, water comes right in through the mesh and gets trapped under the cover where it stays for days. On the positive side, the cover fits well and keeps the dirt off."
1,Delivered Late - Paid for expidited shipping and no refund,I paid for fast shipping and was shown on the order that this would be delivered by 12/15. It arrived 4 days late on the 19th. I have been waiting over 24 hours for a response from ACEHardware regarding a refund of the additional shipping fee.
1,Too tight,"This cover fits too snug, and shrinks with time. It has become a chore to cover and uncover our grill, and the rear corner seams have torn. Plus it won't fit at all with the tool rack attached, which itself is not particularly easy to install and remove."
5,Excellent quality,"The cover is made of a heavy high quality material, with venting so moisture can dissipate. Well worth the price."
3,Going on the second one in 2 years,This cover is great for keeping snow and rain off my grill. Only if it wouldn't tear at the seams it would be even better.
4,It's worth every penny,"This cover, like the grill, is well made and will last for years. I like the venting to prevent moisture build up and the velcro straps on the sides will keep it on even in high winds. Protect your investment with this great cover."
1,NOT a 'premium' gas grill cover,"Definitely NOT a premium gas grill cover. I've searched high and low for a quality Weber grill cover (like the one that came with the grill). I am now convinced that Weber no longer makes them. This expensive cover is no different than the Weber cover I purchased at a local hardware store and I paid about $40 for that one! Skip this one; I'm trying a totally different store that specializes in quality, heavy-duty materials."
4,A wonderful overview of wine regions & producers,"This book does a wonderful job of describing the various wine regions of the world, what styles the regions are known for, and who the major producers are. Although it would be too hard to outline specific vintages, the book does highlight specific varietals, cuvees, etc. that each producer is known for. A better all-around information book than Hugh Johnson's Atlas, in my opinion. Makes a good companion to a rating guide by Clarke, Johnson, or Parker."
5,The ultimate tutorial and reference for novices & experts,"Sotheby's encyclopedia includes detailed maps, photos, diagrams, wine labels, ratings, and just about anything anyone would want to know about wine in a very user-friendly format. Absolutely the best wine book available."
4,"Works fine but tastes ""funny""","These did not taste as good as I remembered. They worked just fine for my acid reflux, but they taste like they've been sitting around too long."
5,Outstanding value,"An excellent basic mouse from the fine folks at Kensington. The shape, size and feel are all good. The warranty is unparalleled for a cheap mouse. The software (on the Mac) is some of the most flexible out there (though it still hasn't fully matched its former glory from the days of Mac OS 9)."
1,Not ergonomically correct!,Not only does it not move smoothly but the shape will make you a candidate for carpal tunnel! Save your money!
5,Fabulous piece!!!,"How lucky to have found this piece! It fit beautifully and is gorgeous-much better than the peices you would find in stores that carry body jewelry. Delivery was prompt, service was great-could not have asked for a better deal for a better item!"
1,Terrible Karaoke Machine,"I purchased this mainly to have a karaoke system that would connect to my existing entertainment system. I was extremely disappointed in the performance of this item. The main reason for my dissatisfaction is the sound of the microphone. There is way too much ""echo"" on the voice & no way to adjust it. I will end up using this as a DVD player in my camper since it's size makes it very portable. Don't waste your money on this. Purchase another machine if your looking for a cheap karaoke console."
3,It's OK for the price,"I only give it 3 stars because the machine works all right but there are a few things that I don't like:(+) Price is right(+) Works OK as a DVD Player(+) Karaoke works fine (need to turn the TV volume up to hear your voice well)(+) Comes with a microphone which is about $10 value(-) Doesn't play all DVDs (machine is too sensitive to read old or slightly scratched discs)(-) Doesn't play DVD subtitles that can be switched off right(-) Takes a little longer to load some DVDs(-) Makes noise when reading a disc(-) The remote control isn't user friendlyI use the machine mainly as a Karaoke machine and to play VCDs. In general, it's fine for the price."
1,Total waste of money!,"Oddly enough, I did not purchase this item from Amazon. I selected it as a free gift for a 15-year service award at work. It's not even worth the time it took to ship. I could tell as soon as I pulled it from the box that it was poorly made but the first thing that went wrong is the power button broke so I had to rely soley on the remote to turn it on. Then, the disk tray malfunctioned and refused to stay open long enough for me to even insert a disk. I noticed Amazon has it listed as ""not currently available"". Smart move on their part. Good riddance!"
1,Garbage.,"Purchased this a few months back (for apx. $50) with the sole purpose of playing DVDs purchased from Greece. First machine had to be returned because it wouldn't read the discs. Amazon quickly shipped out a second machine. It worked, was able to view the movies -- but, only for a short time. Machine froze, one of my discs is still being held hostage inside this garbage machine.In the meantime, my father also bought one of these players -- same deal, it broke. Don't even waste your time."
4,Colorful and Positive,"After learning that both of my daughters were adopted from China, a classmate of mine introduced me to Over the Moon. I like this story for a number of reasons. It's a true story of international (Central America) adoption containing very vibrant painted illustrations. Everyone in the story is always smiling in this 28 page hardcover. Some people might criticize the story for being too positive and not realistic enough, but it is written for little children (ages 4-8). The parents dream about the same child, and the child is never seen crying, but keep in mind that we are talking about a book that has pink cars, orange airplanes, and a dad wearing purple pants. An author's note is included at the end of the book."
5,Love this Book,"This is about the best book we have that deals with how we became a family - hands down! Our daughter was born in China as is our Number #2 daughter who we are expecting any day now. I found alot of the ""classics"" in the ""how we became a family"" to be not my cup of tea or piece of crazy cake, as it were.""Over the Moon"" approaches the ""how you were born"" subject so beautifully that we felt comfortable reading it to our 3 year old (over and over and over........) and would have felt comfortable reading it to her 2 years ago! A very gentle, happy, gorgeous book!"
5,"Beautiful, heart-warming book","This is a lovely adoption story, particularly for young children adopted from Central America or South America. The illustrations are beautiful, dynamic and colorful, and the story is gentle and joyous. The story captures the excitement and joy of traveling to bring home an adopted child without dwelling on details, so it is easy to add the specifics of your child's adoption as you read. The book emphasizes the permanence of adoption, and that the child was meant to be the child of the adoptive parents. My 2 year-old daughter, adopted from South America, loves the story, and requests it before nap-time and bed-time."
5,Love it!!,Very sweet story!! The illustrations are very colorful and unique!!Great for families who have adopted internationally.
3,The Art work is Beautiful,"I gave this as a present & I think it was liked. However, I found myself wondering if it was more a book that adults want children to like than one they actually crave to read over & over again. It is a beautiful book with a great message, which is why I gave it as a present."
3,Beautiful Illustrations,"First, this is a pretty book. My 4-year old likes this book; however, I have changed some of the wording to fit our perspective about adoption. Instead of ""the lady"" (what odd language) we use birthmother. Also, I skip the ""meant to be"" theme. I think that is sugar coating the truth a bit much(I'm sure it appeals to the red thread crowd, though). I'm sure my daughter wasn't ""meant to be"" abandoned, separated from her birthfamily, medical history & orginial culture. I like the book ""The Color of Us"" by the same author much better."
5,Great book on Russian Adoption,"We searched all over for a Russian Adoption book. Our child loves this book, and we enjoy reading it to her. I highly recommend this book."
3,OK book for out of country adoption,This book is more for out of the country adoptions. Very easy and simple to read.
3,Solid instrumental album,"I have to be honest--Desire doesn't do a thing for me and never has. That is the album, not...well you catch my drift. Belew has assembled a number of interesting instrumentals that for me just never catch fire. It's interesting mood music which is probably the point. Before buying I'd suggest sampling it to see if it's you're cup of tea.Desire isn't a bad album just an unfinished work that offers more than it delivers."
5,page turner,"I was prepared not to like this book; usually I am not a fan of short stories. After I read the first page, I could not put it down. Each story is a unique tale about the strength and power of women. The writer's straightforward and realistic writing style was refreshing. My husband loved the book - amazing adventure stories for all."
4,Highly entertaining,"This book is a thoroughly good read. If you've been to Africa, or dream of going there, by all means have a look. However, I'm also intrigued by the negative review below by the English literature professor who ""found this book in the bargain isle ..."" Exactly where is the Bargain Isle and can I book a cruise there? Sounds like a shopper's dream."
3,"a good read, but is it true?","I've lived and worked in Africa and these stories did not ring true with me...great adventures, based on some experiences, maybe...but biography??...I just don't know. Would love to know and would be happy to eat my words."
5,"lovely, exciting...","this book is so entertaining. it makes me envious of the adventures.I couldn't put it down, often waking up to read a few more pages..."
1,Made me cringe,"Pretty cover and deceptively classy design brings to mind the old truth that one should not judge a book by its cover. I cringed for the thirty pages I managed to stagger through. Being in love with Africa is not enough to make this author's life of interest to anyone. Had this collection of weakly held together and blatantly exaggerated stories taken place in less exotic locations, this book would not have been published. As an African, I found this book unreadable."
2,not enjoyable,"Compared to ""Eagle in the snow"", this story left me wondering who really wrote it! From the very beginning it was hard to follow and understand. Eventually, I gave up and donated my copy to the library."
3,"Not a patch on ""Eagle in the Snow""","Strictly OK. I bought it because I was BLOWN AWAY by ""Eagle in the Snow"". This isn't the same genius."
2,Too short~,Santa is not that skinny. Only way to use it would be to add about another 5 inches or so. Not reasonable. Didn't see a size on the product description. That would have helped. Shipment recvd quickly though.
2,Size matters,My Santa is a big guy but this belt can wrap around him twice. It is unusable and should have listed the size.
1,Cover is different but CONTENT is the SAME,"I ordered this book hoping that it would have supplemental information in it to the Nurse's pocket guide by Doenges and Moorhouse, which I already have. The content is EXACTLY the SAME. So if you already have the pocket guide don't bother ordering. This is the same book with a different title. Just spent $3.99 shipping it back!"
5,book,item was as described and the price was good. shipping time great. will look for this seller next semester
4,Good seller,"The book is kind of old-school so somewhat hard to follow, but the shipper is great -- I got it quickly!"
3,comprehensive but....,"intelligent text and many illustrations, sadly however, none are in color. Beckmann deserves more."
3,Guru Guru - 'Tango Fango' (Repertoire),"Originally released in 1976,this certainly isn't THE Guru Guru that I've become so very fond of from their earlier lp's,like 'UFO','Hinten' and 'Kan Guru'. This is WAY more instrumental jazz/rock that's fused with experimental weirdness. It's well-written and well played,I'll give it that much.Best tracks were ""Tomorrow"",the title cut ""Tango Fango"" and ""Banana Flip"".Line-up:Mani Neumeier-drums&keyboards,Sepp Goldschmidt-guitar,Roland Schaeffer(of Brainstorm)-synthesizer&guitar and Jogi Karpentiel-bass.Fans of '70's progressive and Latin jazz would obviously probably get more out of this CD reissue than I did."
2,Not recommended for light reading,"""Flatterland"" would have been a fairly good read had it not been for the heavy-handed treatment of mathematics. That's saying a lot considering I was a physics/astronomy major in college. Don't get into this book unless you intend to spend some time with it."
1,Literature that makes me grind my teeth,"In this book agonizingly simple theories and bits of logic are spun into a web of mixed metaphors and frustrating wordplay that is tedious, confusing, incessant, and causes the reader to fixate and break his or her reading 'stride' every other sentance to translate into ""Planiturthian"".Entire chapters are devoted to simple mathmatical theories I recall from high-school algebra, which could be described to conclusion over the course of a brief paragraph (such as tacking an extra dimension onto a geometrical equation). After reading the first paragraph of any section and translating all the gibberish, your mind will leap to the logical conclusion about seven pages before the author does.This book offers little educational or entertaining rewards. Reading it is more of a test of determination."
1,Coat tails,"Abbott's Flatland is a work of genius. It's short, to the point and endlessly clever. I've probably reread it four or five times in my life and each time it astounds me. Flatterland is a case of ""more is not better"" and ""cute"" is not clever. Get an original idea Stewert."
1,Regurgitation of old stuff,"Ian Stewart thinks he must write two books a year. But he doesn't really have anything new to say (besides the title which is as old as the hills...). He turns over and over churning the old mathematical ideas that he and others have talked about. What a waste of paper! For heaven's sake: Please let the trees grow! Why turn them into pulp?? I did give this book my full attention, but I got absolutely no satisfaction. This is the man who, as reviewer, called David Berlinski's innovative and interesting book, A Tour of the Calculus, ""California Computing,"" Stewart's implication being that Berlinski, who then lived in San Francisco, was somehow soft as Stewart views all Californians. Let me tell you: This snooty British writer is much worse than Berlinski. Please read better books than Stewart's nonsense."
2,Flatterland: Like Flatland Only Pompous,"Please do not judge the classic ""Flatland"" by the bland ""Flatterland"". While ""Flatland"" was creative and alegorical, ""Flatterland"" is just an exercise in cutesy phrasing.I suppose that Stewart does a decent job of explaining multidimensional geometry to the layman, but is there a need to do it so condescendingly? And what is there of a message beyond the mathematical analogies? Abbott's original is a classic because it is socially relevant. Stewart even references this, but he makes no effort to provide a current relevance to his story other than to reference current culture.This book is an insult to the original classic. Those looking for a better understanding of multidimensional mathematics and physics are better off looking elsewhere."
3,"Fun Book, but hard to compete with original","If you have read ""Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions"" you may find yourself hungry for more. This book passes the time and stretches the ideas, but lacks the originality of the original. Still though, glad its here for our enjoyment."
5,Awesome,I'm in eighth grade and my older high school brother told me to read flatterland. It's amazing! And by the way the puns are AMAZING they're one of my favorite parts of the book. They're hilarious. (also when reading look really close at the dates on Vikki's diary entries)
2,Bride of Flatland,"""Flatterland"" is billed as the sequel to the book ""Flatland"" and like most Hollywood sequels, ""Flatterland"" doesn't measure up to the original. On the subjects that I do know something about (e.g. Doppler shifts) there are minor technical errors, but not of any significance. However, in my opinion, the book fails because it is too much like a Hollywood production. In an attempt to appease everyone, the book performs a ""Dante like tour"" (the book's author's words, not mine) of the huge realm of mathematics and beyond while not attempting to explain anything in any detail. To my mind this attempt at ""drive by learning"" simply does not work. The book would be better served by addressing fewer subjects at a slightly more detailed level. Also, (like a Hollywood production) I could have done without the author interjecting his political views throughout the book."
3,&#65533;Is there an editor in the house&#65533;,"A strange book. Chock full of interesting information but hard to read.After reading, rereading much of the book, my feeling is this book needs an editor. Oh after one fights the poor puns, the `creative' spellings and the curse of an author who seems to want the reader to discover everything the author knows ... and do it `right now' ... the information's all there if ones willing to use `nitogyrcin' to free it up."
2,Pretty weak,"While an interesting introduction to many aspects of modern geometry and physics, this book actually has diddly-doo to do with Flatland. Beyond a few superficial trappings, there is very little about the two-dimensional world, and our two-dimensional protagonist, Victoria Line, is constantly thinking, speaking and acting in ways far more reminescent of a three-dimensional being. Which makes sense, really -- after all, the book is intended to introduce a lot of geometrical ideas to three-dimensional humans, right? Right. So then why bother setting it in Flatland in the first place. (Other than to attract a larger set of potential buyers by pretending to be a sequel, that is. For a true sequel -- one which succeeds not only in introducing the reader to 20th century geometry and physics, but also in enlarging the social world created by Abbott AND in actually depicting a two-dimensional being -- stick with Burger's ""Sphereland"".)"
1,What a great paperweight!,"Absolutely horrible. Assembly is easy until you try to get the guard on and then good luck. Cutting area is next to nothing and the spool lock will not stay in place. It is already unusable after just 30 minutes because it came unlocked for the 15th time, shot off the spool and shot out the spring to lands unknown. Construction is shoddy and overall I'm VERY disappointed in my purchase. It is light and easy to maneuver but this is pointless if you cant even cut the grass. Great paperweight however, you could hold down 5 or 6 stacks."
3,not as easy as it looks,"A little difficult to put together, even my neighbor had problems. String doesn't last very long and it's hard to get apart to replace the string."
4,the Matthew Shepard Story,"This is a great movie, gave me wet eyes. Too bad bad that the quality of the dvd is not that great."
4,would be 5 stars if not missing 25% of picture,"The other reviews on this site accurately convey how good this film was. Unfortunately, the DVD producer decided to ""pan and scan"" the original 1.78:1 aspect ratio film into a 1.33:1 format, cutting out 25% of every frame at the sides of the picture. I hope someone will bring this out in an uncut version soon, ideally on Blu-ray, so we can see what the director actually created."
5,what she can't see,"these are the best books I have read in a long time, only wish there were more, once you start you just can't stop."
4,seven madment living in early 20thcentry in buenos aires,"because the 7 are underclass young people, they dream and scheme with hope to make for some success in the world. i have no ieda about these down and outs and their hope and aspirations."
2,strange and experimental.,"well, to be fair i only paid a cent for it, but it cost about 3 dollars shipping. The music is very experimental, but still keeps to a base tempo for the most part. I highly enjoyed 63, 360' but honestly i didn't enjoy many of the others. It grew hard to listen to after a little while. I suggest this album if it's cheap (less than 2 dollars)"
3,Finally something about bisexual Christians!,"As a bisexual who loves her faith, I fully support this video! It's about time there's film that explores people's bisexuality and faith. I only gave it three stars because I feel like it was lacking content. It could have went further with people's own personal experiences, but it was very good nonetheless! I'll pass this along!"
1,"Unfortunately, a zero star rating is not possible...","...Office Depot CD-Rs seem to be of the lowest quality. Used them to archive about a year ago and only very few are still readable. Of course, CD-Rs have a limited life-time, but I am sure a quality product wouldn't degrade after only 1 year."
2,There's not much here,This book seems like a collection of short columns from a local newspaper. I wanted more information and PICTURES would have been nice.
5,Very enjoyable!,"Although the scientific jargon of the opening pages almost changed my mind about reading ""The Vanished Child,"" I trudged through and found one of the most intriguing mysteries I have ever read.Alex or Richard? Is the up-and-coming young scientist an Austrian baron or a missing American heir? A fortune depends on his identity and more is at stake than money. This tangle of intrigue is intelligent and somewhat haunting. One reviewer complained that not all of the loose ends were tidied up and that is true, but it leaves you thinking and involved long after the final ""The End."""
2,Disappointing ending,"I found the book very intriguing, but nearer the end, I felt as though the author had given up on the story or that someone else had taken over. I was thoroughly disappointed with the ending. As I read, the book raised my expectations but failed to reach them. None of my questions were really answered. If you like books without an ending, read this one."
5,A Fascinating Mystery,"I could not put this book down. I began to feel as if I knew these people, and cared so much about what was happening to them, especially the child Richard. Long after I had finished the book, I continued to mull it over in my head. It is the best mystery I've read in years, and I've been recommending it to anyone who will listen"
5,An Excellent Investment!,"If you are involved with training, course development, or performance improvement then this set is a MUST for you. Each book ""reads"" with the greatest of ease. The concepts and techniques are so simple, yet so POWERFUL! This set is truly an excellent investment for your personal development and growth. Buy it today. Trust me!"
5,Mager Six Pack,The Books arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks for being so prompted.
3,Weber Flavorizer Bars,"They seem just fine and take 5 minutes to install. I didn't get stainless steel, which I would have preferred, because my grill is old and I am not sure how long it will last. Otherwise, I would have purchased the stainless ones."
5,Love it!,"this is Amber Pacific's best CD yet!, i'm a huge fan and love their music, it's a perfect amount of punk, and it's one of those CD's where you love pretty much every song on the CD, not just 3 maybe 4 songs, can't wait for their next CD to come out, now that their original lead singer is back!"
3,"Works well, when it's on...","The standard Weber gas grill cover fits my new Genesis Silver A perfectly. The material is heavy-duty vinyl, well made and repels rain and snow in exactly the fashion one would expect. The biggest problem is that the cover blows off when the wind picks up and there's no cinch cord or straps on the bottom edge to hold it on the grill. Perhaps this is why the Deluxe model is longer"
4,"A little tight, good quality",Quality heavy duty material with corner straps to slip around corners but somewhat tight. Have to stretch it tight to get it on.
5,Acco Solid Brass Fasteners & Washers,Acco Solid Brass Fasteners and the company's washers are industry standard for movie screenplay presentation. The fasteners and washers are far more sturdy than commercial supply house brands. Not all commercial supply houses stock ACCO products and those that do charge an arm and leg for boxes of 100. Through Amazon.com I found much better prices and sooner than guesstimated delivery dates.
5,fast and fun,"The wildly entertaining story of Hura, a young Berber woman. Sent to marry an ally of her Father, she is unwilling to subject herself to the rigors of harem living and grows in power to become the real ruler of her husbands lands.From her first escape from the harem right into the slave quarters her unorthodox antics keep the plot moving rapidly. Her adventures are even more amazing when you remember that this is the tale of a real woman of sixteenth century Morocco. Ms. Malt is obviously well acquainted with the lifestyle and customs of the Middle East. A great read!."
2,Inexpensive But Flimsy,"As a graduate student doing research for my thesis, I have a lot of paper to punch and put in binders. I bought this punch mostly because it was inexpensive and fit in my desk drawer. While it isn't totally useless, it is flimsy and prone to jams. It will routinely take only about four or five pages at a time without jamming (it depends on paper thickness), and once jammed it is sometimes hard to get the paper out of the punch without ripping. A second problem is that of chads. Until the 2000 election, I didn't know what the little partially detached pieces of paper not cut by the punch were called, but now I am unhappy to report that, thanks to this punch, I too have problems with hanging chads!Swingline makes a lot of great office products, but if I had to do it over again, I would buy a better grade of punch. Unless you only have one page to punch here and there, this punch is not really up to the job."
2,Pretty good condition,The front cover of the book is torn around the edges but the rest of the book is in good condition
2,"Not a typical king size, strong odor, and extremely stiff","It was apparent upon immediate receipt that this pillow was not a typical king-sized pillow and was only two inches larger than the standard memory foam contour pillow I already own.As noted in the other comment, the odor was extremely strong. Though I have not owned this pillow for very long, I made numerous attempts to ""air out"" this pillow, and the odor remains very strong.In addition, this is the firmest memory foam pillow I have ever experienced. I'm hoping with time that it will soften, because it certainly can not be used for sleeping in its current state."
3,Didn't like this one at all,"Well, I think this could have been a decent story. It was hard to get into at first for me, took me like a month before I just cranked it out. It was a semi-interesting story. It had slightly dull characters, no lasting characteristics or remerable characters. It also had some plot twists, but that had no real point, so they were basically stupid. . . The only good thing about this book was the writing was descent. It was easily understandable and flowed well together, very mellifluous, but other than that twas incredibly short and boring. The main problem was it was really just to predictable. After a few dozen pages you could pretty much figure out exactly how it would end. At least I did successfully.If any of you have read Shadowmancer (written by same author), this book is way better (in my opinion).Sorry Taylor, don't mean to discourage you or put you down on every book I've read of yours, you just can't create unique enough stories to make it big. . ."
4,A very readable study of Poe,"Scott Peeples has created a great overview for Edgar Allan Poe studies. This introduction takes a step-by-step approach at looking at a variety of categories of Poe's life and work, linking thematic similarities in both his more famous and not so famous writings. Peeples keeps this very approachable and very readable, not entirely focusing on the pyschoanalytic criticism that is often invasive in Poe studies. Even so, he grabs bits and pieces from a variety of Poe scholars throughout the years, from Mabbott to Silverman to Meyers to Hoffmann. This book will help you get started as a serious Poe scholar, though it certainly shouldn't end here. This is a good companinion to Poe works, but the serious Poe scholar should continue on to other biographies and criticisms as well!"
1,Atlantic Starr All-Time Greatest Hits Review,This collection of songs are NOT sung by the original artists. It is not good. BEWARE!
1,This is not the group Atlantic Starr just their songs,This cd contains all of Atlantic Starr's songs BUT it's not the group singing on the cd. Very disappointing!
2,"Just so, so",It worked great for 6 months than died !!! I used it on average twice a week to grill a sandwich ....... it should have lasted years considering my limited usage !!!
4,Great Small Panini Grill,"I just got this but I really like it. I would give it 5 stars but I had to return the first one after it stopped working after 1 day, looks like that one was a lemon. The second one is working great, it melts the cheese, cooks the meat, and I get the perfect panini. I have limited counter space so this was exactly what I needed."
1,doesn't work,"I got a two-pack of these from the local hardware store and I have to say that they are terrible.One of them will not close because of the poor-quality construction. The other one has been tripped at least twice, but the mice have escaped with the bait.Don't waste your time with these."
1,Save your money,Save your money. Mouse would set it off before it could get inside to get the bait. Very disappointed!
1,Worthless--Do not buy,"These flimsy traps just don't seem to work. They've got a balance mechanism that is supposed to drop the trap door once the mouse enters. But, it's poorly designed and as a result, the door just drops on it's own most of the them."
1,If I could give no stars I would,"Do not buy this trap. If you feel like throwing your money away - just send me the [...], please. The trap is so small a baby mouse would have trouble getting in there without freaking out. Our mice went in and out of this thing with ease because they could just back up once they got the treat.This product shouldn't be legal to sell it's so awful."
3,works but...,"I set two of these at my mom's house the first night. They both caught mice, but one had chewed through the plastic and escaped before morning. I'm going to buy one of the multiple catch traps like the EatonEaton, J. T. 421CL Multiple Catch Mouse trapor the Victor Tin CatVictor Tin Cat Clear Top (2 Pack)so they can't chew through, and as I now suspect we have more than a few of the little critters living here."
2,Mixed Luck,"I've had mixed luck with these traps. In a previous house, they worked every time and I was able to get rid of 3 or 4 mice over the course of a year. My latest attempts have been less successful (maybe I have smarter mice?)It seems to be down to inconsistent manufacturing quality. A number of the traps need a little bending of the plastic in order for the doors to snap all the way closed - the friction created by the locking mechanism is enough to prevent the door from dropping completely. Others close fine, but also open rather easily. I found them tripped, closed and cleaned out of food. I'd say about 1 out of 6 that I owned worked well and the rest just worked as dinner trays for the mice."
1,No good!,"I bought a pack of two of these and baited them. The mouse was able to get all the bait out of one of the traps without getting caught. The other trap had its door shut with no mouse inside. I understand the principle at work here, and how the trap ought to work- but either our mice are too smart for these things, or it's just a lousy design. The live-catch mouse traps we've had great success with are the simple rectangular ones, which are see-through amber plastic and have a little door which only opens one way. Only trouble is, my husband kept stepping on them so we have to buy more. Argh!"
1,Mouse dies slowly because you can't tell if they're caught!,These are little torture chambers for the mouse. Who has time to check them every few hours? Checking requires resetting the trap.
4,I know these work...,"Bought this kind specifically because my mother used them when I was still living at home. The mice in my house mysteriously disappeared. Not sure where they went, but not into these :(. Peanut butter works pretty well.Also, each ""order"" was 2 of them. The one ""open"" in the package required adjustments to get them to work. Would have been nice if they each worked easily right out of the package. Might be worth trying this with another kind. But I'm all for saving the mice!(Just be sure when you let them go that they are far enough away from houses that they won't just go right back in. Someone else may not have these humane traps!)"
1,Ya gotta' be smarter than the mouse!!!,"You've gotta' be smarter than the mouse -- not only did the mouse get the bait out of these traps, open them up and escape with little difficulty, but he did it 3 times and MOVED the traps to where he wanted them!!!!Victor needs to go back to the drawing board and do some REAL testing on these traps -- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.After the 3rd time, I bought a JT Eaton ""Repeater Multiple Catch, Mouse Trap"" (no kill) and caught two mice in four hours time!!!!"
2,Works but not that humane,"I've had a bunch of these and caught quite a few mice with them, so they do work and they are cheap. However I am now going to buy something more expensive. These traps are very small, with tiny air holes, and mice are nearly dead after a few hours in them. If you are going to check the traps every hour or so and transfer the mice out quickly, they will work, but otherwise they kind of defeat the purpose of having a ""humane"" trap."
1,Bed service,I want to return them since I received them late. I worte the retun request until now(5 days) nobody give me answer.
3,kitchen mouse in laguna niguel...Victor Live Catch Mouse Trap M007,"took a while but i got one. now there's more and they seem to be catching on, so i need to be creative. good design, simple, worth it."
3,Tricky to set and too many escapes,"Works most of the time, but tippy design makes false trips too easy for mice. Recommend Mice Cube instead of this."
4,"Great T&A, really really really bad hair","I agree with all the above reviews. Great stripping, a script so stupid you have to laugh, and plenty of naked ladies. But, becuase the movie was made sometime in the '80's, the ladies' hairstyles are so horrible bad it ruins some scenes. Because of that, it loses one star."
2,Very sub par,"Anybody who watches this for a sexual thrill take my advice stick to the 18 and up stores. This movie is dull, the same girl does the same kind of routine over and over again."
2,Want T & A? Try the WWF!,"Just a huge, huge disaapointment. Oh my, how sad. All the women are droopy and look depressed, like they are being forced to do what the do. Sad."
2,"Silly, but what do you expect?","Silly plot about a group of strippers trying to drum up business by featuring new talent. The trouble is that their new young dancer can't strip, so they a hire a professional to hypnotize her to strip when the song ""Takin' it Off"" is played and they can't get her to stop afterward whenever the song is played. It's silly, but Candi Evans as the young stripper is easy on the eyes, as well as some of the other women in this picture. Take it for what it's worth and there's ""plenty"" to see in feature."
2,"Cute, but useless","The book's theme is attractive, but useless. To explain using the author's own paradigm: Jesus Christ, for all of his goodness and potential as a leader, was still crucified. This is the same path that servant leadership leads to in the corporate world. While the spiritual world may have offered reward for this destiny, the business world is far less accommodating.The book is well written and persuasive, perhaps good as the foundation of a management theory course (stressing the word theory, here). But in the end it is not worth the purchase simply based upon this reality."
5,Lawn Roller,This is a good quality product at a fair price. It does exactly what it is supposed to do.... flattens the lawn. Works best after a good rain because the earth is wet and softer. I ordered it on Friday and received it on Monday. Can't get much better service than that.
2,400 lb???? then I'm 900 lbs.,30 gal's of water @ 7.5 per gal 225 lbs. my be I need to fill it with LEAD
5,Such Good Boys,"Such Good Boys: The True Story of a Mother, Two Sons and a Horrifying MurderThis story is very frustrating because several people knew this mother had mental problems and did't try to get help for her or her children."
4,Happened Locally,I chose this book because it occurred a mile from me. Matthew attended the same high school as my daughter did at the time. I wanted to read the details that the local paper the Press-Enterprise did not. I often wonder if the current occupants of the apartment know what occurred. This is a definite read.
4,Good Book for someone that likes true crime books.,"I thought it was a good book. I wish it would have had updates of where the 2 boys are today, or at the time the book was written. I feel sorry for anyone that has to deal with someone with mental illness, but by no way does anyone deserve to die over it."
3,Good book -- a very sad story,"It's a fast read. The book focuses on the life of the sons (who killed their mother). I remember when this story made headlines. The sons were villains in the media. I don't remember any of the information in this book being in the media. Shows how people can be convicted in the media when the public doesn't know the whole story. The mother was mentally ill and her sons had a tragic and abusive childhood being raised by her. Not an ""excuse"" to kill someone, but I can understand what drove them after reading this book. Tragic all the way around.Not one of those books I couldn't put down.. Not one of the most well-written books I've read, but I appreciate the other side of the story being told."
4,Such Good Boys:,"This book is a very good book and story line and written very well as you have no problem following the course it takes you down with all the twists and turns. Very interesting and in one way you want to put it down because of some of the content and then on the other hand you can't put it down because you want to find out what happens.Read it, you'll understand what I mean."
2,story needed a better writer,"story starts out fine. then, along the line it seems to me there are gaps that need to be filled in in order to make really good sense of this. like the reason for the murder; writer makes it sound like because mom slapped him around he killed her, not true. he was abused and her family knew it also, so they bear blame also. maybe this guy just got tired of her and idiotic theories, moving constantly him trying to stay in school basically taking care of his brother. gotta be hard, had i been on this jury, i would have gone for manslaughter."
2,give it an F,only a f grade it didn't have much sense to it and the writing and gathering of information a bit over the shop
3,Sad story...so-so writing.,"I was instantly captivated by the story of two sons murdering their mother. Unfortunately it's a situation of child abuse gone too far. It's amazing how family and friends never thought of seeking help for those boys. I would never justify their actions, however it's so sad that they felt this was their way out. On the book itself, I think it could've had better writing. Even though you have to state the facts because it's a true story, it could've had a more interesting approach."
2,One-Sided and Poorly Written,"I really don't like a lot of editorializing in my true crime, and this one was full of it. The author attributes thoughts and feelings to the characters that can't possibly be known and the portrayal of the boys in this case is slanted. I don't mean that I think they're innocent and she disagrees with me; I mean the facts about the boys and the case are hardly presented while we get the back story of the victim's entire family tree. The book was also written very much with a good guy/bad guys mentality between the cops and the boys and that is simply annoying when you're trying to read non-fiction. I wish Mara Leveritt had written about this case."
4,I Went to school with them...,"I didn't know Jason and Matthew well, but everyone at school knew Jason and we had no idea what he was going through. I plan to read this book, and have heard it is well written, and graphically accurate. So sad, that none of us knew what he was going through and he didn't try to reach out for help to us, though who knows if that would have helped. I hope this book helps give ppl the insight on what abuse can do to children, and to encourage us to watch out for warning signs, come down hard on the local governments to fix CPS, and encourage kids to come forward when they or someone they know needs help. <3"
3,Interesting but not outstanding,"This book held my attention, mostly because is involves a mentally ill mother and the outcome of her illness. It does not delve deeply, though, into the mental illness issue or the investigation of her murder."
5,Good read,"I received my order within a couple of days, very fast shipping. The book itself was a great read. Would recommend this book to anyone."
2,Pass It!,Dull....Kept waiting f/something interesting to happen. Written as if by a teenager. Skipped over most of it because it was so annyoing.
3,Nothing to flip about...,"Was not impressed with this title. Disturbed knowing a mother could act in such a manner. Written well by author, just an ok read, nothing to keep me reading, easy to put down."
5,Awesome book!,This book was so hard to put down and really sheds light on how important it is to talk about mental illness within a family.
4,Interesting Read very sad,"The book was very sad to hear how a Mom could treat her boys growing up, but it still isnt right what either kid did to her. Nobody deserves that and nobody saught her help so everyone was to blame for that."
4,The Humor Story,"Imagine what your life would be like if you didn't have to do laundry ever again because your plant eats your dirty socks but sometimes you might wake up in the middle of the night with a plant vine wrapped around your leg. The Plant that Ate Dirty Socks is by Nancy McAuthor and is a fiction/humor book. If you haven't read this book you haven't read a funny book. Michael said that ""If you don't have a pet, get a plant. You only have to water and give them plant food. You don't have to clean up after them and they don't cost much."" This is McAuthor's first book."
1,It was funny some of the time,"It was funny some of the time. Once, I got so mad because it was so not funny, I through it on the floor! :)"
5,Too funny!,"This is one of my all time favorite books! As a kid, I used to read about 3 or 4books every week! I thought this book was hilarious! I remember one day in school, we had quit time where we were reading quitly to ourselves. I wound up getting in trouble because I came upon a part of the book that was so funny that I laughed so hard that I fell out my chair laughing so hard and loud. I got this book to give to my son when he grows up so he can enjoy it as much as I did!"
5,The Plant That Ate Dirty Socks,This book title was chosen by third grade students in an after school book club which I help lead. My rating is based on the fact that the students really enjoyed this book. Several are interested in the sequels to it and wished we could do so next month. They were able to get into some interesting discussion and predictions!
4,a story that will stay with you for years to come,"I read this book when it was first published, in 1988 when I was in 5th grade. I don't rember the details after all this time, just that is was 2 brothers sharing a room when one is neet and the other messy, and they get mail order seeds that grow into ""carnivor"" plants (socks are cotton, ie, a plant, and the plants eat socks) and the boys use them in a sciene fair, get famous, and I think a soap company is involved somehow?Basicly, I wanted to say that even if its not a ""classic"" Its a story that you or your kids will think about years down the road. I would classify it along with Chocolate Feaver, and How to Eat Fried Worms as good stories that will capure your imaganation and hold it, helping you grow through the years."
5,HELP PLEASE,Hello i Need a chute for my mower will u be intrestred in selling me the Chute? Contact me if you will sell me the chuteSuperBluePanda@juno.com <<~~ I Check email Every Day
2,Oh this could have been So much better.....,"Having bought this DVD I was looking forward to sitting down in front of the TV for a few hours and having a great time, But NO I found this a very poor viewing experience. I don't know if it was the very boring narrative or even the lack of enthusiasm in the voice. I also found that each section didn't role into one another in was jumping from place to place... It just seems that it was put together by a non-football(soccer) producer. I have had this for a number of months and still haven't watched it all."
5,Awesome history!,"I love sport, and especially soccer. I don't know much about the deep history of it, nor the great moments. This is an awesome DVD and always steals my attention when it's on. I definitely recommend this to any 'newbies' to the sport, or history buffs. Great footage, and organized into really interesting moments. Can't beat the price either."
5,Explorative,"This is an excellent recording in the vain of the ECM spacial sound. With a hint of the Advant Garde mixed in. I think this is a very accessible disc, and highly recommend it."
3,Where's the CD?????????,"Where's the CD? This book does not come with a CD! The book does say that all the examples are on the Web but its just not the same.I am disappointed that he dropped DAO coverage in this book. In this Access 2000 book he had dual coverage of DAO and ADO. The author even admitts in this Access 2000 book that DAO is easier than ADO. He says the DAO chapters are on the Web. I cann't log on to the web on the train.........I really like Barker's Access 2000 book and would recommend it over this book. There were a lot of useful examples in his book that help me with my job.I also donn't see any new examples in this book. One topic I would like he to talk about is ""Self-Joins"" and how to use ""self-joins"" to calculate percetange changes...."
1,I did not like this book,"I am sorry I bought this book. I don't think it does much. Alison Balter's book in better for general information, and to me it's just full of fluff. I will most likely throw it away."
2,This is a plain old run-of-the-mill coloring book,"I was very disappointed when I opened this book. The cover gives every indication that this will be a nice short storybook or activity book similar to a Highlights book. Forget it. It is nothing more than a 99-cent newspaper-print coloringbook with a nice cover, and some cheesy stickers that do stink, but not like you'd expect. Save your money and go to the 99-cent store where at least you get a decent amount of pages for coloring on."
2,No scratch and stink!,"Unless the definition of scratch and stink has changed since my youth, the stickers in this activity/coloring book smell like any other page- dusty- no matter how much I scratch!"
3,"Not too bad, but...","They worked great in the copier, but I was hoping that I'd also be able to write on them with a vis a vis marker and erase them again. They are very hard to remove the overhead marker ink from, and it leaves a blur on the page. Highly recommended if you just want to copy for a presentation or something, but not at all recommended if you're (for example) a teacher wanting to use the same blank over and over for classes."
2,plate stand,The quality of the stand is very good and heavy and thick but the color is wrong. I ordered black. They are not straight black. The are a lacquered reddish black.
5,Attractive plate stands.........,"I needed several plate stands, or easels to display decorative plates I had. Saw these on Amazon and ordered them.They look great, support and show off the plates well and were priced right.If you need attractive plate stands, I would advise you to take a look at these.Priced right and do the job sums it up for me."
4,leave,It would be nice to get a product such as yours without a sticker that was almost impossible to get off. The adhesive did not come off. Mike
2,Not the best quality,"I just received the plate stand and it is not symmetric--one side is longer, so it does not stay up straight.It looked as I was expecting, and was a good price, but the quality is not there. I could not count on this rickety plate stand to hold anything of value as I am sure it will tip complete over once there is weight on it.I hope I can get a refund but I am not pleased with the quality of this product."
4,Great product for the price,"Used as a gift and it is exactly what I was looking for. Sturdy and ""nice"" feeling. I highly recommend."
1,"Picture + description says black, but got cherry wood","I was ordering these easels for my bosses awards that have black frames. The picture shown on Amazon for the easel is black. The description says black. What arrived were cherry wood colored easels. When I explained to my boss what happend and said I'll refund it and try to get black ones, she was frustrated with me (no doubt thinking I ordered the wrong thing) and said forget it I'll just keep them. I was careful to order the right thing and thanks to someones carelessness, I look like an idiot. I will never order from reorient again. Oh, and beyond all that 2 of the stands wobble because they arent attached symetrically. The hinges were attached while the two wood pieces were not aligned correctly."
2,way too small,"I ordered the 3X/4X and it wouldn't close by at least 8 inches. It's sized wrong. In addition, the material is very flimsy."
3,Size deceiving!!,"I wear and XL and I ordered the 1x/2x. I figured it should fit. Well, if you have a large chest don't get. Not even half of one of my breasts fit in! The clasp like said was very small and flimsy and I had a hard time getting it done. It was rather tight for being the size it was."
3,Very attractive,"This is a very cute and sexy piece. But it isn't the greatest material and the company can't get the sizing right. The large was way too big, the medium was way to small for a medium. Nevertheless, I was drooling when the wifey came out with it on."
4,Love it!,"I love this outfit, but for me the undies were a little to tight and the top fit perfect. I was scared that the pleather buckle would snap too, but after I get it on it was fine. And it actually held my boobs in! Which is a feat for me."
1,Mullet Run is everything it promises...sort of,"It is a ""wild tale""...it is filled with ""brutality and flesh""...it is ""bizarre"". But the characters are only two dimensional. The ""passion"" we are promised is really only lust. We are told on the back cover of the book that Jason has fallen in love with Jessie...but there is no such emotion communicated. There is no emotional connection with the characters. At the most, it is a suspenseful yarn woven around lots and lots of sex....A male's ultimate sexual fantasy. One would think that the women of Mayport were nymphomaniacs...at least the women characters in the book are portrayed as such. Then we have a little ""sci-fi"" thrown in with werewolf girl! Also, there were far too many typos in the book. I am sure there are some interesting stories about Mayport. I am sure there is a rich and colorful heritage there. Surely there is more than what we are given in Mullet Run."
1,GARBAGE,"A pathetic excuse of what the author calls ""southern gothic."" He has taken local stories and lore from a small fishing village in northeast florida and tried to make money with these stories. He is so confused by the stories he attempts to write and instead of getting the stories right or correct, he goes off on all this violence, and lies, a muddles the true facts of actual history from the quaint little drinking village with a fishing problem. Don't waste your money on this garbage. He's not even from the little fishing village of mayport but lived outside the village on mayport road, but will tell you that he is, which is another embellishment to go along with all the other horse manure in his books and this one is just another of his trash in an attempt to make money. I also might add, the 2 star reviews and about are all friends of the author."
2,The Mullet Run low grade sequel to Jetty Man,"Having grown up in the Beaches area of Eastern Duval County at roughly the same time as this ""trilogy"" takes place, I was drawn to the jacket brief of the first installment, Jetty Man, and found it to be fun reading due to crucial conflicts and riveting characters. But the lastest installment, Mullet Run, does nothing to add to the development of the original characters in the first of the series. It is so bad, in fact, that I could not even finish the book. If I never here about the ""Mary C Mo-Jo"" again, it will be to soon!"
1,Wrong product ships when you order this item - every time!,This is a beautiful item although when I ordered it a rectangle beige plate came. I exchanged it two more times and still the rectangle plate came. I even sent a note several times with a picture of this plate showing it is the wrong item shipping and still nothing. I am still awaiting my credit for the final plate I returned. Dont order this item as it is marked wrong in their system and this beautiful plate will never come. :-)
5,Hey Uncle Mike!,"Uncle Mike,I'm so happy for you! I have also always wanted to be a writer...and now that someone I'm actually related to is becoming famous, it just makes it seem so much more possible. I know I'm only 13 years old, but its better to get an early start on things, right? I'm still wondering if you are ever going to send me an autographed copy of your book, or if I should just buy one and send it to you in the mail and have you send it back. None of the people at school believe that you are a published author. So, if you do send me a copy, please put something on it like ""to my favorite neice in the whole world"" or something like that. :) I know I haven't met you very many times, but its kind of hard to not love me...j/k...mom, Kim, says hey and congrats on your book. Please respond to this as soon as possible. sugah@cheerful.com is my e-mail addy...its a new one...love always, your neice, who also wants to be a writer,_,.-'``*``'-.,_Steph_,.-'``*``'-.,_"
1,keep away,"its saggy and not sturdy, your ferret will fall off of it. its not made well at all. however it might work for a rat or sugar glider."
1,make/add a shelf...,"Unfortunately the shelves are too soft and cannot hold the weight of our ferrets, making it a wasted purchase. The idea is great, but once you get past the metal frame, the inside is just soft material and can't even hold a bowl on it. Sorry..."
4,"If you read this at Oval, Watch your back","Once again I am drawn into the gritty world of the London crime scene. In Ken Bruen's books, I am never sure who is more vicious and criminal, the serial killers or the police who are searching them out.This book has our serial killer going after the police starting off with a traffic warden and aiming toward the protaganist himself, Ken Brant. We have all of the usual police who we got to know in previous books including Brant (of course), Falls, Roberts, the incompetent Super with his ""golden boy - snitch"" McDonald. Alas, we no longer have my favorite, Lisa since she killed herself in McDead.This book may be a little rough for many readers and it might be hard to follow by people who have never been exposed to the peculiar language that is spoken in South London (some say that it is English, but I would not swear to that)."
3,Not as good as the movie!,The book was written about 10 yrs before the movie came out and it wasn't as good as the movie. The movie had more interesting and humorous dialogue. And it starred Jason Statham!! Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!!
3,Interesante,"Una buena investigación sobre el tema, completa, entretenida e interesante. Algunos capítulos un poco lentos pero en general un libro para leer"
1,Agree....poor material,I too have not had great success with this product. Cracks developed after a short time and progressed rapidly to the base. Will look for another in a stronger material.
4,Reflections of an Under-rated band,"I remember loving ""Reflections of My Life"" by Marmalade when it crossed the big pond and found its way onto American Top 40 radio, but I didn't discover Marmalade until I got under the covers with Susanna Hoffs and Michael Sweet. Hoffs and Sweet blew me away with there cover of ""I See the Rain"" by Marmalade. My wife and I liked the song so much that we searched You*Tube for a Marmalade version. Not disappointed, we came to the awareness that perhaps Marmalade had more to offer than the one hit wonder reputation built on Reflections.Although I could have been satisfied with fewer tracks and a sampling of their best recordings, I'm glad I spent the cash on their three disc set. Consistent quality, writing and sound make Marmalade a must have for any Brit invasion fan, and offer an indictment against American radio for not making this band a household name in the US."
4,Fun game but will not run without CD in drive.,"A good game with lots of skill building, but if I would have known that I had to change out the CD each time I wanted to play it, I would not have purchased the boxed version and waited almost two weeks to get it. SUCH a pain!OK. Here is an later comment. Lots of fun and ""making"" the zen gardens by completing the puzzles is an added bit of art. If you get stuck with the higher levels you can take a screenshot (Ctrl+Prt Sc) or (Fn+ Prt Sc) and then pause the game by using the menu button. Figure out the best word and then go back to the game. This takes quite awhile but does let you move through a puzzle that you might be stuck on. Oddly enough I found a few puzzles in the master and grand master level that I couldn't seem to get close to completing without ""cheating"". Then more difficult puzzles (in theory) were a breeze.Have fun."
1,word zen,"The copy of word zen sure looks like it would be fun to play I cant get it to play on my new pc.The rep. told me belives the game works.It was a used game.I told him I have windows7 I was told no problem. Does any body have any ideas? I think Im gonna get a refund be Im not sure. I realy want this game,one that works."
1,Virus warning,I couldn't install this game because my virus protection stopped the installation with a warning. I don't know if it was a false warning but I decided to not proceed. I did buy the game from another source.
3,Not the same as before,I special ordered these because I couldn't find them locally and needed to finish a project. I could have bought a store brand for less than half the price but I liked the quality and style of the Avery item I ran out of. It turns out Avery made a production change and kept the same item number so the item I ordered was not the same as what I had. It's still a good product but I purchased a top dollar item to get an exact product.The change is not major but I needed them to match.Disappointed.
4,Simply Better Than The Rest...,"Love these sheet protectors! We have used them for many years and they are simply better than the rest! They have changed over the years (not quite as good as they used to be), but are still far better than the competition, which we tried recently. They are worth the extra cost. More economical in the 200 count box. Never seem to have too many; my spouse likes them for protecting shop manuals printed from online, I use them for recipes and cookbooks I printed online. Will buy again!"
4,"Great, but kind of difficult to put on","For what you get for the price, this item is fabulous. The only reason I gave only 4 stars was because it was confusing to put on the first time and it is really hard to prevent bubbles."
4,Fun game.,My kids really like playing this game. They say it is a lot of fun! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because each player has to have their own cartridge to play the multiplayer mode. But thanks to Amazon I got the second cartridge at a very cheap price!
4,Suite Life of Zack & Cody is fun for all kids.,"My daugther just turned 11 yrs old, and she loved the game but found it a little hard to undersand. I am sure that once she gets the hang of it she will be fine with it. The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is one of my daughter's favorite show, so I knew she would love the game."
5,Very efficient,"I used these before but the hardware store I used to get them from had closed. I tried going cheap and buying the first trap i saw only to find that it often didn't snap at all, and when it did, the mouse would often be left staring at me when I checked the trap. Not to humane in my eyes. These traps always go off (i never find one still set but missing the peanut butter). When it does, the end appears to be very swift for the little vermin. I've used two of the more than 20 time in the past before they break. That's a pretty good return for the money."
4,"Good, cheap, sensitive","Good, simple, cheap product that works well - I always use a dab of peanut butter and it never fails. Only challenge is setting the trap without scaring the crap out of yourself - the traps are sensitive and sometimes will snap shut if you don't get the metal tab set snugly enough. It often takes me 2-3 times before it holds, but the product is good enough that I keep returning to it."
1,Unlike the old ones,"These traps are NOT like the ones we are used too. Use them once and after the mouse is caught the trap is no good, it will NOT lock in place for a reload. The old version of this traps could be used over and over."
1,Useless,We bought 4 of those kind of traps and I saw with my own eyes the mouse walking over it!We had to trash them away and buy a glue kind of trap
3,Good pic and Dictionary info.,It's okay info about basic Crystal. Picture are very helful to go find a crystal name. Good as a dictionary of crystal. David
3,lots of gemstones,"this really did not help me much with what i needed, but to someone else that knows alot of different stones it would be very useful. im just a beginner and there was alot of gems i have not heard b4"
3,Healing Crystals,I think this is an average reading book. For the beginner this would be an excellent start. Not advanced enough for me.
2,Not that great,My laptop screen had spots. I still have no clue how they got there but the cloth didn't work well because I really needed something wet. I can use the cloth for something else so no big loss.
2,DOES NOT WORK,I bought this product thinking that it would work for all the finger marks and dust on my new laptop. But it doesn't. Don't buy this and waste your money.
3,Probably good,"For some reason, I got the idea that this cloth would clean the laptop screen on its own, but I think it just added a little further smudging. It must be that I also need to buy some kind of solution or spray with which to use it -- haven't done so yet, so my laptop, ""inherited"" from my daughter, remains a hodge-podge of fingerprints. On the assumption that it works well when accompanied by a spray, I'm giving it an average review."
4,Works Well & Cleans Efficiently,"This cloth has been under my use for several months and so far I'm pleased with the results. I always keep my workspace close to spotless so I can't say that I've given it a 'industrial strength' workout, but it does the job well, picks up the lint and dust, and doesn't scratch or blemish my equipment."
4,balanced,"a good balance of easy and more challenging trivia to appease new, moderate and hardcore old timey fans of the king"
2,Unfinished Business,"After I finished reading this book, my first words were, ""That's it?"" Admittedly, when I first opened it, I kept reading, however long winding and digressive it seemed, but I just wanted to see if it was *going somewhere*. I just ached for *something*. A death, an accident... ANYTHING. I felt like I was in a bad soap opera: Knowing that what I was watching was possibly complete hogwash but I was too hooked to give it up. It's not that anything in it was enthralling. No spell *on me* was cast; it was just boring, but I needed to finish it to make a fair evaluation and I was searching for something in the book that would make it worth the money I spent on it (having bought it as a used book I only paid $1, by the way.) It's a mean trap, this book. It caught me with its mundandities, but in the end, you're in Nowhere Land. I was going to rate this with a 1, but I decided that getting me to read all the way through deserved another point."
4,This book rocked my server world.,"this brilliantly compiled reference makes Mark Menasi's work look like an afterthought scribbled on a cocktail napkin. This truly rivals The Da Vinci Code in its stunning, intriguing drama and adventures in AD scripting"
3,Its informational,"This video contained a fair amount of information on full tang, and half tang samurai swords. Its fairly indepth. Its definately worth the... bucks you'll shell out for it. So give it a try if your into a pretty good sword documentary."
4,Fly Fishing the North Platte River,"Walinchus does a good job of breaking this incredible river down into its smaller components. However, his synopsis lacks detail; for example he does list the dominate hatches and compatible flies but does not suggest sizes for all. He includes a few small maps for each section, but they too lack in detail. All in all this is a good guide book for a first timer to the area and will definitely help you catch more fish."

2,Nothing Exciting - Pretty Lame Mixes,"All 5 mixes sound almost identical! The Dance Mix and Extended Club Mix - there's a difference? The Exacto Mix is just shorter then the other two. As for the Dub Mix and Bonus Beats, just a means to fill disk space. Don't bother with this one."
1,Cheap Rip-Off,Forget some cheap crap remixes & covers. Support the REAL band and purchase Feeling Strangely Fine
5,i love this song,"if this is ""closing time...one last call for alcohol...gather up your jackets..head for the exits.."" i love this song."
1,NetLingo,Not what I was looking for. Too hard to use and understand for myself and my teenage grandson. Maybe we need NetLingo for Dummies? I liked nothing about this little book
4,Very Handy,"To NOT be aware of this kind of information, definately limits the effectivness to intellectually communicate in this present day world of the Internet. A very good tool."
3,A Bit Disappointing...,"I bought this book through Amazon and I was expecting all the songs from the CD or, at least, the ones I considered important. But what happened is that it only comes with the 'usual' Peter Allen ones. I mean, not that they are less good or anything, but being a huge fan and a musician I was expecting the songs that are practically impossible to find the sheet music of. I am referring to the ""Legs Diamond"" ones. I LOVE those tunes and they are missing on this album. If anybody know where can I get them, some, or even ANY, of those songs please get in touch with me through my e-mail above. I would be very pleased. Thank you."
5,Great Atmospheric Work,"This is a great disc that will take you on a very interesting journey. It should get more praise then it does. It wasn't what I was expecting when I purchased it a few years ago, but after two listens I was quite intrigued.Darling's later works can get a bit to repetitive, but this really pulls you in."
4,Good core video,"Its not the toughest workout video in that it focuses in on one part of the abs or other muscles, and it really won't make any particular muscles very sore. Instead, this video is a good core video because it works all parts of your abs, lower back, gluts, and some of your upper legs. I do this video 1-2 times per week, and it has gradually made me core more shapely in the core area, which is great for the beach. I'm sure it would work faster if I did it more often, but I use this video as an ""easy"" day from harder workouts."
4,great workout,"I really liked this dvd, I don't tend to do these tapes but got cought in the winter doldrums and needed a kick start and this is excatly what it did, I think it was a good overall workout with easy to follow instructions but challanging enough to feel like a good work out"
3,Great workout,"I have been doing P90X for a few months now and was in the market for a new workout when my friend told me about Gilad and his videos. So I bought a few to try it out. Lets just say I am fully satisfied with this workout. Occasionally I got frustrated because one of the things Gilad doesn't do is show you how to do some of the moves. But other then that, this is a great workout especially with Haiwaii in the background :) Enjoy"
2,Boring,I didn't like it. I find the DVD boring. Sorry but I don't like it!! But I gave it to my husband and he like the DVD and he's been using ever since it was delivered and he said it target his abs and he has a better abs but not for me.
3,Gilad,I mistakenly ordered this video and Amazon was great about the return. It was very simple and they were very quick on response. I would order items without a question again.
3,"Polarities marked, but ...","I ordered three of these for a very old hand-held calculator for which the OEM no longer makes batteries. Once charged up, they worked just fine. There is just one caveat: you will need a voltmeter [or some other way] to determine the polarities of the terminals prior to charging them or connecting them and doing possible damage either to the battery or the electronics it is powering. Either that or you will have to know by osmosis that the groove around one end is the positive side. Not very considerate of the manufacturer not to label it with a ""+"" symbol."
1,Picture is VERY misleading,"I purchased this product because I thought the price was great for the picture shown. The picture shows a 50 ft cushion wrap, but was in fact only a 10 ft. I could have purchased a way cheaper one from my local store. Picture should reflect what is being sold. VERY MISLEADING."
3,10 ft square and small bubbles,"I was a little surprised that it was actually 10feet square in total size and small bubbles. I guess at that price, I should have known better. Description needs to be mproved on this item."
4,Classic!!,"Purchased Paddington Bear and the book ""Paddington"" for my littlest nephew. His dad is from the UK, so this is a classic! Paddy's really cute and I love his rain gear!!!!!"
3,Cute but not for toddlers/infants,"I ordered this bear for my son for his first birthday and ended up keeping it but ordering a different Paddington (My First Paddington Bear). I originally ordered this one because I had a Paddington when I was younger and it resembled it greatly and seemed to be the most original looking. The bear isn't very soft at all and his legs do not bend so he is stuck in the standing position. This one reminds me more of a collectible bear; not really a toy that can be played with by a young child and remain intact. This bear just doesn't seem like a huggable, squishable, durable bear that a little child would carry around. I am still keeping him however, and I think I will give him to my son when he out-grows the other Paddington bear and won't be so rough with toys."
4,very cute,"Not the most durable looking little bear, but he's super cute. I purchased the book about Paddington to go with him as a gift for my friend's daughter. A very nice gift combo."
4,Classic,A good representation of Paddington. Sent to a 9 month old child.The quality of the stitching and material are quite good.The bright primary colours really attract his attention. He enjoys holding the bear while mom or dad read Paddington's adventures to him.
5,Cohen does it again!,"Joe Cohen, the inimitable author of A Good Friend series and I Love You Because, has done it again! He has compiled an amazing amount of facts and lore about a subject that even ""us guys"" had never given much thought about. Cohen's wonderful blend of humor, conciseness, and pure information make this a more than worthwhile read.I heartily recommend The Penis Book as a Christmas/Channukah gift, birthday gift, or just a gift to a friend for no special reason."
4,Body beautiful,"I came across The Penis Book at the Museum of Art in San Diego. I found it delightful, informative, and a great gift idea. I gave it to a friend on her 70th birthday and she loves it. Now she wants to buy one for her daughter."
1,Dull and lifeless,"This book is a disappointment. What could have been a funny and informative book is just another brief treatise citing Kama Sutra passages and a few quotes about impotence. It's cheap, yes, and might make an amusing gag gift, but you're guaranteed not to flip through this book more than once. Don't bother."
4,The Penis Book,"Well, like it said...love them, hate them! This book has something for everyone.A fun read again and again"
2,This game is dated.,"Thiis game is dated and therefore, the narrowness of the categories did not translate well. That made the game tedious to play. We love scattergories, which is similar, more fast paced, easier for big groups and basically more fun."
2,Not a Top 10 Game,"I liked the concept of the game, but what the box doesn't reveal is that only 2 of the 5 categories on the card have answeres. The others require that you agree as a group on whether an answer is appropriate. The 5th category on every card is make up your own question, and again the group judges the answers. This means that the majority of game play time would be scoring. I am annoyed that I spent so much on a game I wouldn't want to play, but we did have fun just going through the cards and using the first two categories to try and guess aloud what the answers would be. You'd be better off with a book full of top 10 lists."
3,Dave from Ransomville,"Top 10 is an excellent bridge between Trivial Pursuit and Scattegories, two games nearly played to death in the last twenty - five years. The standard lists of trivia are adequate if cold in nature. The real fun of this game and the gimmick to give it longevity is the ""Invent 10"".Imagine Scattegories wherein players decide the categories. I wasn't too sure how the more literal players in my group would take this opportunity at creativity. Surprisingly, it is very liberating for everyone. Players at the back of the pack can pick categories like Top 10 herbs or Top 10 new wave bands that are specific to their own interests. Like Scattegories, players only receive points for legitimate answers that are unique from other responses.This simple twist to an old idea livened things considerably when my family played this game recently."
5,"Excellent insight, but dated","Most of the essays are pre-bubble, although the book is published in 2002.Better look elsewhere, or atleast for a newer incarnation. See: ""Internet: Opposing Viewpoints,"" James D. Torr (2005)"
3,my tag.,"Maybe I'm pedantic, however when I spend US$2000 I expect the stop watch hand to sit at exactly 12 o'clock and not 1 second before 12. Tag heuer after all do claim to be precision instruments.Unfortunately I have already scratched the glass from what seemed to me to be a minor ""bump"". My Omega certainly wouldn't show a mark from an equivelent bump.Other than this it really is a lovely looking watch."
2,Disappointed,"I love the look of the Monaco but for the price I expected more of a watch. I had a minor bump against a wall and the front 'glass' is scratched, I have two other TAG's and they are bullet proof but the most expensive one is NOT!!!! Also I don't think it keeps very good time, my other watches are always spot on but I have to check the Monaco every other day. Also I find that the adjustment bezel is easily pulled out - overall a sexy watch to look at but with very disappointing performace."
5,Excellent Synthesis of Use Cases and Soft. Rel. Engineering,"As a specialist in the field of software reliability engineering, I have always felt that there were many fruitful relationships between use cases and software reliability engineering. Now Richard Denney focuses on these in his excellent new book Succeeding with Use Cases. I was impressed by the user-driven approach and the bridge Denney provides over the language gap between the business orientation of management and the technical orientation of software developers. The book is readable, practical, and filled with examples. It should be required reading for anyone working with use cases."
4,Not sure about Use Cases? This book will answer all your questions.,"Example after example; model after model! After reading this book, I was ready to begin implementation! Chapter 3, Operational Profiles, will convince and evangelize engineering and management. The degree of detail is perfect for the professional. Great Work!"
3,"Intriguing, yet poorly written","This book gave me new perspective on Iranian culture. Kousha discussed issues that are most pertinent to women in Iran: mother-daughter relationships, husband-wife relationships, and the different experiences and expectations regarding education and careers.While the content was interesting, the book was repetitive. For example, on page 54, it says, ""Most often, children assume the mother's attitude and beliefs toward the father before they ever get a chance to know him on their own."" Two paragraphs later, on page 55, it says, ""children assume the mother's attitude toward the father before they themselves have ever had the opportunity to know their father.""If I were to disregard the repetitive nature of the book, it would rate higher."
5,"Very, Very Nice","I use this cam with my Kenwood P-NAV514 Video/Navigation Pack with KVT-514 and KNA-G510 system. Only time it has not looked right was when it got rained on. No way to avoid that really. I just tilted the cam down a little bit and wiped the lens off. Worked great from then on. It costs more than other backup cameras, but the detail and quality are there even at night. Makes it look like the day out the back even when it is dark outside. Use it on my 03 Dodge Ram quad cab Cummins. Cable was just the right length to get into the cab near the driver's side kick panel. I'd buy it again. Just might add it to my wife's Chrysler 300."
1,Not Water proof,"Becareful , this product is not waterproof , installed on tacoma double cab license plate, working only 2 days, good image quality night and day."
1,Wrong item sent,"Beware this seller (Audio Kraze). I ordered the Kenwood CCD-2000, and (without checking with me) they sent a different camera (CMOS-200). This was an unacceptable substitution for me. Avoid this seller and find this item elsewhere if you can. Boo to Amazon for letting these sloppy sellers trader via Amazon."
3,Not what I expected,"This is the only rear view camera I've ever used, so I had nothing to compare it to.The build seems solid, the picture quality is good. My concern is the fish eye lens. Objects only several feet behind the car appear to be at a safe distance. Also, since my vehicle's rearward visibility is not good with the cabrio top back, I'd hoped to be able to judge if 'the vehicle' behind me was following too closely ... it's useless for this due to the fish eye. As a 'back up' camera it fills the bill. As a rear view camera, it fails. If it had a less extreme fish eye lens, it would get 5 stars.EDIT: I later found a ZOOM function in my Kenwood 8120. This makes the camera more useful as a backup camera. Rear view camera, not so much."
1,old bulbs,"The bulbs I purchased for mu bug zapper must be old, even though they are in their original package. I have tried everything, including taking them to a hardware store & they do not work. I am too busy to return them, but will probably never purchase anything again through your site. Replacement bulbs should work in something they were made for & they are the correct size bulbs."
4,Bug Light That Works,"I worried that the light would not work with my older zapper, but it works fine and a much lower price than from Stinger for the original. It also saves me about 10 watts on electric bill over the OEM model - great all around once they shipped it (my only complaint is the 4 days to ship)."
5,Groundbreaking,"Fun^Da^Mental continue to push the envelope. Less industrial than ""Erotic Terrorism"", ""There Shall be Love"" features beautifully crafted cross-cultural collaborations with Sufi singers, a South African choir, and even some Tuvan throat singing. Multi-textured, compelling, even uplifting -- this is a must-hear for the adventurous listener. Highly Recommended."
5,"Toys ""R"" Us/ Babies ""R"" Us' greatest gift","On July 16, I ordered this Geoffery. Yesterday Geoffery came.This toy is perfect for ""R"" Us.He has 8 great phrases:1. ""What's the matter? You never seen a talking giraffe before?""2(and rather singing). ""I don't wanna grow up.I'm a Toys ""R"" Us Kid.""3. ""Remember,animals are people too.Well, not really.""4.""Let's Play!I had to say that.I'm a toy.""5.""Squeeze me!OK, not that hard.""6.""Have you hugged your giraffe today?""7.""I'll always stick my neck out for you.""8.""I love toys so much,I became one.""Recomended.I like its bandana."
3,Not for infants,My mother bought this toy for my son when he was about 6 months old. He never took to it. It had been sitting in the bottom of his toy chest for 6 months. We took it out about a month ago and he seems to love it now. He drags it around and presses the ear to hear the messages on his own. He laughs when it speaks. It's good for a few minutes of entertainment here and there. I think a child has to be at least 10 or 11 months old to appreciate it.
4,On Second giraffe,"This is the second giraffe we've gotten. The first one stopped talking several months after we bought it, but my baby loves it so much we had to buy him a new one."
3,Good overview of the different cultures present,"This video is a good overview of the cultures present in Singapore. As someone moving there, it was helpful to show the family, but could have had more information about the history and what life is like there on a daily basis."
3,interesting book,The book is interesting. A child can understand the boredom with just being a pig and daring to dream about an adventurous life.
5,Can't Wait for sequel To Grace Surrendered,"I am not a fast book reader - it oftens takes me three months to read a book, but I couldn't put down this book!! I read it in one day. The author has a way of pulling you into the story where you don't want to stop at the end of each chapter. You want to read just a little bit more, and there is no good stopping place. I am hoping there will be another book out soon by this author. I love the characters -- especially Phillip. This would make a good movie."
3,I Didn't Know It Was Loaded,"As a big fan of Robert Ruark's stories of hunting and fishing, I was a little disappointed with this book. I Didn't Know It Was Loaded has next to nothing to do about guns or hunting, instead, Ruark rants about the world around him. Definitely a different side of Ruark's writing talent is exposed here."
3,Good Paint after mess,Most of the paint was usable however when product arrived all of the gold paint had spilled all over the inside of the package creating a mess. But once that was cleaned up the rest of the paint was good quality paint.
4,works well,Paint works well for the model I am building. It is easy to appy and dries rapidly. I am pleased with the way it performs and would recommend it. I will use again in the future.
4,Good Stuff,"Testors always makes great paint, so this is a great set, good price, and the paint sits well on model parts. Only thing I wish is the thinner comes in a bigger bottle."
3,PAINT,have not got this order yet SO I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SAY WHAT THIS ORDER IS LIKE OR HOW IT LOOKS
4,"Great Game, Worth the Buy..","Alright, so it's no Dynasty Warriors, we'll give it that. But, trying not to compare it to another game and just rate it on it's own, Drakengard is a fairly good game. It's not the most incredible thing you'll ever have seen in an RPG, and indeed some of the missions are repetitive. (The last battle, as well, was rather frustrating, as it suddenly gets extremely difficult to stay alive). The voice acting made me wince.. it's done well, but the accents are a little.. irritating. However, it kept me occupied well enough, and is definitely worth a shot."
3,Best for obsessive compulsives,"Got this game for $20, at that price point the game becomes worth it for casual buyers.Pro's:1.) the story is dark and intriguing2.) level up system takes the edge off grinding3.) voice acting ain""t too shabbyCons:1.) grinding for levels2.) still a button mashervariables to enjoyment:the endings of which there are many and largely depressing"
2,Great game.....As long as you dont get the last endings.,"I am here to warn you. If you like a good story line, get the game, as long as you dont think that a bad ending could ruin the game. I thought the game had a great story line the first time through and it got me hooked. There were 5 endings and I was determined to get them all. I got the first 3 and I was starting to think that something was going wrong. Then I saw a flying baby that eats people and I know it was going downhill. The final ending almost made me write a letter to Square-Enix asking them why they made an ending like that. This game had so much potential but Square-Enix killed it. Im not going to put the ending up on the board but if anyone wants to save hours of their life not looking for all the weapons then they can send me an e-mail. My suggestion, borrow the game once or twice to beat it if you really want to get it and save the money."
3,Go Buy Dynasty Warriors 5 Instead.,"I played this game and I'm glad I borrowed it. The plot is really good but its the gameplay that brings it down completely. It was slow and boring, nothing different execpt pressing the same button over and over again, I am usually I fan of this genre, but this one was terrible. Go buy Dynasty Warriors, more action and fun."
1,A very dissapointing RPG,"This videogame is like Dynasty warriors, except that you don't have any ally fighting alongside with you and the enemies look stupid. However, I do recognize that the game has good graphics, and that the storyline is very touching. But I believe that's not enough to make it a good game."
2,OK,I played it on the march issue of playstation magazine demo.The only things bad are that its exactly like Dynasty Warriors and Panzer Dragoon but not combined very well.Theres not many attacks and the game makes you dizzy.But the game has good action and its fun on the dragons.
4,BEST HISTORY PROGRAM EVER!!!!!,"You Are There is simply an unsurpassed way of getting a capsule review of historic events. It arouses interest and provides incentive to dwelve more deeply into specific events throughout history. I would very much like to see a release of the entire series. There are more of these individual DVD's available for those that wish. The quality of this disc is quite good and the shows are complete. However, I can't in good conscience acquire any more because I refuse to support any series where they inject a watermark during the program. There's just no way that could have originally been there. If not for that marring, this would have been 5 stars."
1,A 1980 VHS (or betamax?) recorded on DVD,"This was by far the worst purchase at Amazon ever. I paid with S.H. almost [...] for a DVD that does not cointain updated information.This DVD was recorded in the early 80's, the information about the cities is very old, and when you go online to check about the tours or sights, cant find anything. Also the quality is as poor as a Betamax.You are better off with a quick visit to [...] and try to find about the Swiss sights and places worth a visit."
2,blah blah blah,"Most of this book is the same as the MCSD Fast Track VB 6 book for the other exam (70-176). There is some useful information, but most of it is a cursory look.These two books should have been put together into one book and made better. If you buy both, you've been had."
3,OK but not enough,This book works fine for the test but not enough to cover the whole test and also missed some very important part of it
3,Not too bad if you already have a good knowledge base in VB.,"First of all let me say that I reserve 5 stars for a book that basically walks me through an exam. I haven't seen one yet! Overall this book wasn't too bad. Although it was vague in a lot of areas. The objectives were covered, not in great detail but covered. If you already have a good background working with VB development this book can be used as a prep for the exam. The questions at the end of the book were pretty good, although not really like a Microsoft question. This book in my opinion should not be the only book you use to get ready for the exam. If you are starting from scratch, you might look elsewhere for material."
1,Don't waste your time or money,You only need to purchase the 70-176 book in this series. 95% of all the information in this book is contained in the 70-176 book by the same authors. The other 5% you do not need.
3,Angel Lessons,"""Once upon a time, up in the highest of heavenlies, there was a huge castle. One bigger than anyone had ever seen. A castle so huge you couldn't see the tiptop except for the bright, bright, shining light that shone like diamonds. This light could be seen from all over, even from the furthest cloud."" ~ pg. 1Laurie Elizabeth Bornstein has created a beautiful imaginary world where angels learn important lessons. While humans learn their lessons on earth, Cherry, Saraphina and Salina enjoy life on Angel Cloud.The sister angels live with their father and brother and have the personalities of children you might know. When the angels get bored, whatever will they do to occupy their time? As the adventure progresses, they learn they have a far greater destiny than they imagine.~The Rebecca Review"
2,Weak Portrait of a Tormented Soul,"Taylor tries hard to get the reader into the head of a likely insane loser in Lambdon Spa in the north of England, but too many of the relationships are insufficiently explained and lack credibility for the book to really work. He's semi-kept by a gay man who he no longer sleeps with, and it's not at all clear why the other guy tolerates him since they so openly despise each other. He's constantly spending massive amounts of money on a co-worker he's obsessed with, who is a class-A tease. Why he's so into her and why she leads him on is never convincingly explained. Ditto the sexual relationships he has. There are a few good scenes, but too much is unexplained--and it feels as if Taylor has left it all unexplained because he's unable to come up with anything plausible. There are a lot of better books that portray a soul tormented by obsession, anger and fantasy spiraling toward self-destruction--try Duncan McLean's ""Bunker Man"" for example."
2,Lots of waste!,"The roll is perforated every 12 inches, but it does not tear at these spots. It rips and you are left with jagged strips and must use numerous pieces. Quite a waste!"
4,Works as Window Insulation!,"I ordered this bubble wrap to add some cheap and much needed insulation to the old single pane windows in my apartment. Even here in San Francisco, the weather gets a bit chilly in the winter. Next to the two big windows in my room I could feel a major draft coming in this winter. Inspired by a post on Re-Nest, I bought this bubble wrap to add insulation my windows. I wish I had opted for a larger bubble size for more effective insulation but this still helped. This particular product had the best deal and the quantity of square footage that I wanted compared to the other options available. Be sure to measure your windows and get the right quantity!Window insulation tip: If you want to attach the bubble wrap easily without the hassle of tape, just spray your window with a little water. Try it, the bubble wrap will stick! Now of course it won't stay forever. Mine falls down a bit every couple months but it's still so much easier than fighting with tape!"
5,Great deal for the price!!,"Hey, if you need to move...do not pay the UPS store or your local walmart, target, rite aid or grocery store for bubble wrap. I bought this and had it shipped to me in 2 days. I really was going through bubble wrap fast. I must have bought2 containers at the grocery store and then another 8 from Hobby Lobby but the best price is through here. Great price! Great value!!"
1,White Paint Chips Off,"I registered for and received these baskets. They look nice in the picture, and they are a great price, but the white paint flakes off and the edges are very sharp. Needless to say, I am returning them. I received 6 of the Wendy Bellissimo baskets (which include NICE liners that coordinate well with all bedding - more expensive, but worth it) and I highly recommend them. They have no sharp edges and they are not painted so there is no issue of paint flaking off."
1,WARNING do not buy!!!,"I am appalled that babies r us would sell such an inferior product. I purchased these baskets as a gift and am returning them right away. I opened the box to put items in the baskets as a cute gift, but just can't be responsibe for putting such a hazardous item into a babies room. The paint flakes off, the baskets have sharp edges all over them, and pieces of the baskets splinter away. How are manufactures able to make these items specifically for a babies room? I would never recommend any baskets like these. I am not understanding how they are even on the market!?!? Don't waist your money. You will just be returning them when you see the poor quality!!!!"
4,"Mellow, introspective Rypdal","It's hard to say that this is typical Rypdal, because he's covered so much ground musically. Nevertheless you'll find here Rypdal's distinctive violin-esque guitar in six serene, meditative pieces. These are not tunes to tap your toe to, although there is one tune, ""Flight,"" that has some of the more headlong, flashy guitar work. What you generally get in place of a driving beat is striking musical imagery and color. At times, the way the instruments come together is like two glaciers flowing into one another or streaks of morning light streaming across the sky. This isn't my favorite of Rypdal's work, but it is very fine."
2,"Can work, but only on small rodents.","This trap can actually catch mice, but if they aren't small, will only injure them. It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat, who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as ""starting fluid"" in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care."
2,not the same as pictured,This Trap is cheaply made. fell apart and had to figure out how to put back together. It was not the same as pictured. The V was not Red.
1,I wanted these to work!,"These looked so nifty! Especially as someone who's always afraid of getting snapped by the dumb traps, or the gross idea of emptying one! We bought two of these and put them in an area of the garage where we knew a mouse lived.He was very happy for the peanut butter treats, but those traps sat empty for 3 days, even though the missing bait proved that our mouse visited both traps frequently. We finally gave up and I let my kids set them off for fun. Armed with plastic forks they lightly tapped the triggers. Nothing. They whacked the triggers with the plastic fork handles. Nothing. Finally they pressed down on the forks hard enough to cause them to bend, and the traps finally went off.I'm not sure what kind of mutant mice these traps were designed to catch, but if it's big and strong enough to set off this trap then it's too big and strong for a mouse trap to kill."
1,Boo!!!,"Woundeful mouse feeder! Dont waste your money. Mouses in my apartment very intelegent, never get in trap, but allways eat all peanut butter..."
1,falls apart,Shoddy design and construction. They wouldn't set right out of the package and fell apart within seconds of me trying to fix them. Do not buy these.
2,"Difficult to set, easy to trip and fragile.","They work when they work, but are likely to trip when placed on the floor. I have several of these and they often require setting and resetting several times before they stay set, the slightest bump will set them off. They're fragile too, a couple stopped working rather quickly due to wires bending. The Ortho Press N Mouse is much sturdier and so much easier to use."
2,It didn't kill the mouse,"These are very easy to set, but a mouse can still get the peanut butter off without being caught. Dumb animals my foot. The only mouse I caught was not killed. The trap caught it by the front shoulder, and the mouse managed to drag the trap along with into another room. I am not sure how long it had been in the trap, but it also managed to chew half of the trap away. I don't want mice in my house, but it seemed VERY inhumane to have a mouse stuck in a trap like that. I will not use these again."
1,Not a Humane Option,"After miserable luck with humane traps (the mice have all been able to get in, eat, and get out again) I bought these as an alternative to traditional traps, mostly for re-usability. However, both times they sprung and caught something, I was 'treated' to the manic thrashing of the trapped, mangled but very much alive mouse. The first time I lasted 20 mins before I gave up and finished the job myself. The second time, I did so as soon as I realized what the noise was.The problem is that the jaws don't snap together - there's about a 1/8 to 1/16th inch gap, which for these guys, is just enough to keep them alive. Traditional snap traps are a much better deal, even if disposable."
2,3 live mice,This is indeed easy and quick to bait and set the only problem is it lacks ooomph it doesnt kill the mice though it does seem to be able to hold small mice i caught 2 in the same trap yesterday both are doing ok now one was completly inside the trap the other was halfway out today another live catch he was securly held halfway in the trap by the jaws he has since joined his friends in an old aquarium i utilizing as a detention facility
2,Great design but mixed results.,"It's a bit hard to rate this product...on the positive side, I give it a 5 for design. It's so easy to use and is way better than the old style mousetraps. You can set this with one hand and no fear of getting snapped, and you can remove the mouse from it without having to touch the mouse. Really nice.On the negative side, it doesn't always trip. I am frequently finding that the peanut butter is gone and the trap has not tripped. There's no way to adjust the sensitivity, so I don't know what to do. I fear I'm just making my mice fat.I wrote the company a while ago and, to their credit, they responded. They told me to not put too much peanut butter in the trap. I've done that, but I often find the traps untripped.So: Really super design, and when it works it is great, but it doesn't always work.Given the fact that reliability is an important part of any product, I'm giving this a 2."
1,"fell apart on first setting, not as pictured","the ones received are not the same model as shown, ones received are junk, fell apart on the first setting. look for the ones with the spring wire that wraps around the outside, these are garbage, literally fell apart in pieces setting them the first time.Lots of loose little metal pieces inside that come apart and out of slot easy. too easy. waste of money."
