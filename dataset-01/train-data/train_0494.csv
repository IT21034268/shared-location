3,Suspicious Reviewer,"I am sure Emil Gilels' recording cannot be surpassed but why not get both? After all, there isn't much of overlap.By the way, I can't help questioning the intention of one of the reviewers named Dag Johansen. He is proactively reviewing most of Andsnes' CDs and giving them very poor rating. In fact, all he is reviewing are Andsnes', no other.I don't mind that if it is truly his honest opinion but there's something fishy here... why does he keep buying Andsnes' CDs if he hates his playing so much? It's as if he is trying to damage the artist's reputation... Shady....I have not actully heard this CD or any of Andsnes'. Just felt I needed to report on this."
4,Not quite Emil Gilels,"I've always been a big Andsnes fan but I must say that I find the 1974 Emil Gilels rendition much more ""lyrical"" and sensitively rendered. Comparison is stark between the two versions of Arietta. While Mr. Andsnes showed dazzling technique, by comparison Gilels' refined elegance lent the piece the gentle and simple grace that it deserved. Mr. Andsnes's Arietta sounded a little rushed and I detected ever so slight a glitch in one of the opening notes?"
4,"Good, but not great","This CD was good, and I defnitely want to hear more from them. It did sound a bit too much like old Bright Eyes at times. I think this is a good band to watch for in the future."
5,"Short album, but a great mix of songs","What a great debut! The lyrics are simply fantastic, and this EP is a really amazing mix of songs of different tempo. The first song, You're a Wolf, made it onto their subsequent album, Leaves in the River, later in 2007. I ended up buying both this EP and Leaves in the River because their music was so good. The EP ends with I Don't Know if I'll Be Back This Time, possibly the best song on the EP, although I think that The Garden That You Planted is really good, too."
5,Oooooooh-eeee-yieeee-ooooooh!,"I heard ""You're a Wolf"" on xpn and bought the CD just to hear it again. The other 4 songs are a bonus - they were great too."
4,"""This Is Sergio Franchi"" (But Only A Portion Of Him)","""This Is Sergio Franchi"" is a wonderful compilation disc which provides the listener with a basic overview of the late tenor. However, so much of what he recorded for RCA remains unreleased. Sadly, there seem to be no plans for release of these treasures in the near future. Franchi's live recording at the Cocoanut Grove in LA remains a classic and would be ideal for CD release. As for this disc, the highlights are his wonderful readings of 'Core 'n grato"", ""Serenade in the Night"" and ""What Kind of Fool Am I."" There really is not a bad track on the disc. My wish however would be that it could be a bit longer, it is a relatively short CD and that it could include some of his live recordings and some of the duets he did with the lovely soprano, Anna Moffo (album ""The Dream Duet""). Perhaps in the near future we Sergio fans will see more of his musical legacy revealed."
3,cost more than it should,"$40 for two relatively cheap plastic garment bags was a bit pricey. I probably should have shopped around a little more, but I was in a hurry.On the plus side, they did arrive fairly quickly."
1,Piece of Garbage,"Cheap piece of garbage. The thing tore the first time I used it, even under light use."
3,Exactly as described,The product was exactly as described. Shipping was a little pricey but the item was needed.
4,Wedding Bridal Garmet Bag,The item was as advertised and arrived on or before the shipment date. It was in great condition. Thank you!
4,Not your average vampire story!,"This was a vampire story that thought outside the box! A young gay man who is on the rebound from a breakup, decides to take a class in Egyptology taught by a magnetic, enigmatic professor.Although star athletes are being murdered and horribly desiccated, Jamie, our young student is oblivious since he has other things on his mind..his burgeoning love affair with Professor Danilo.But there is much more to Danilo than meets the eye and Jamie will eventually have to choose between returning to his bland, ordinary world or joining his vampire lover and mentor in a lifetime of passion, power and blood.The story seemed innocent enough in the beginning, but as the reader progressed with Jamie, events unfolded beyond my wildest expectations!Emotional roller coaster of lust,love,passion, murder"
2,Let down by a poor Aida,"It's good to have a new recording of Aida in English. Unfortunately, this project has been spoilt by a major flaw, and that is the casting of Jane Eaglen in the title part. Not only is Miss Eaglen's performance cool and dispassionate, her voice often turns ugly above the stave. Her performance leaves much to be desired both vocally and dramatically. O'Neill is a good Radames and Plowright, having turned to the mezzo repertoire, is a vivid Amneris. The other roles are adequately taken and the orchestral playing is good without being remarkable. Anyway, a recording of Aida without a proper Aida cannot be recommended. Thus, I can only award it with 2 stars."
3,"Actually, a bit of a disappointment","This was one of those rare instances when I felt that the film worked better than the book on which it was based. Maybe this was because John Wayne was, in a sense, acting out his own life. Somehow, though, the characters were more convincing in the film and worked together better. Oh, and the book was surprisingly light. I sat down with it, expecting a good read, and was finished in a couple of hours. Not that it was bad - but it should have been a lot better."
5,Excellent! Must Read,This book I was forced into reading and it actually turned out to be a great book. It still has relevance today being that prostate cancer is still around. This was a really good book! Most of the times I don't like westerns but this is one of the few I like. You really must read it. Even though it is kind-a gross. At least the parts when he shoots somebody but I guess that's his job.
1,Forget it.,"If you are challenged by the real thing, than forget it. This book wasn't worth the bother, so I started in reading the Adams authored originals, and find them just fine, thank you. As to the Adams influence on my photography, I have utilized his standing on the roof of the van (he had a Suburban) and combined with the proper lens, love the point of view.Did you see where at a yard sale in 2000, some guy bought 65 glass negatives for $45 and are now worth $200 million because they are bonafide Ansel Adams stuff that had been thought lost in a fire? Two Hundred Million. Read his books, not this one."
4,Good book - too text bookish!,"This is indeed a great book. It talks a lot about the basic photographic techniques and is a good read for a beginner. However, most of the book is limited to black and white photography. The book is also a bit out dated.Overall a good book for a serious beginner. It will help a person get accostomed to both the scientific and the creative aspects of photography."
5,WOW!What a voice,"""Can't take that away"" is one of the best songs on mariah carey's album in this song she really shows her voice. I didn't like the song crybaby because it's too much of rap and i only like the strong ballads that mariah do and not the hip hop rap songs"
3,Mariah needs to work with other remixers,"Can't Take That Away is wonderful track, not perfect but very good. Morales Revival Mix is only average, it's too long and Mariah sounds tired and her vocals are boring... but I really like the idea of that remix - it could have been phenomenal!David Morales is great remixer, but Mariah has worked with him since ""Dreamlover""... Mariah really needs to work with other remixers also! Her working with Junior Vasquez was step to the right direction, so why did she return to Morales again?I really would like to see Mariah working with Hex Hector, Tony Moran, Peter Rauhofer, Thunderpuss..."
2,Simple but colorful pictures--but nothing else to recommend.,"You should be aware that this book is only useful for reading to babies no older than, say, two or three years old. Each page (with a few exceptions) contains only one word and a picture that describes that word. But in some cases, for thoses children who do not know the word, it is difficult to determine what in the picture the word is describing. For example, on the ""scarf"" page, one sees a picture of what looks like a little boy wearing a cap, scarf, and jump suit standing in front of a large window with prominent white curtains and snow falling outside. So what in that picture is the ""scarf""? And to make matters worse, the scarf and cap are identical in color and virtually touching so a young child might think they are one item. Of course a parent could clarify this to the child, but why should a parent have to work at clarifying the shortcomings in this book? Save your money and let this book remain on the bookshelves."
2,LOW LEVEL RECORDING-BUT TRY BOSCOE,"Yes, the recording level on this is way too low. Normally, I have my volume on like 16-20. You have to turn this up to 30, the lowest level of recording volume I have ever encountered. Remastered from the orignal tapes...hummm... You might want to re-record it on to tape or CD using an equalizer. It gets better that way. Also, ALL YOU OUT THERE-if you like this you have to check out BOSCOE. Hey anyone, is Pieces of a Man any better???? Doesn't sound so sampled here...This stuff deserves better..."
5,brillant,this is true rap.forget the so-called y2k which i know gil scott-herron would have a take on.this album showcases a great artist.arguble as important as bob dylan? a true lyrical poet.who is passionate about his subject matter.and isn't afraid to tell it like it is.and the music is right on time.this is a must have album.i agree this is the greatest rap album ever.
2,disappointed,the sound on this CD is terrible. I keep adjusting the bass & treble to try to get it to sound better. not working...
2,Too acessable,Jazzy artist who uses simple rhythems and predictable lyrics of love. Sound familiar? I like her name so this gets 2 stars just for that...
3,A bit uncomfortable,"Bought this during my second pregnancy for additional support. It worked overall to support my low baby, but was difficult to find shirts to cover it. It crosses like an x across your chest making it noticeable in everything but a turtleneck!! But helped for a long day at Disney."
3,Needs size information,The description does not give a size. This particular item is size Tall/Medium recommended for women 200 to 250 lbs.
2,One of the weaker choices in the Great Conductors series,"If there was ever a conductor known for a single recording, it is Ataulfo Argenta, a Spanish maestro who died ignominiously in his forties when he decided to warm himself on a cold winter night by sitting in his car and running the engine in his garage. The recording that made him famous was Espana, an audiophile showstopper from Decca that is legendary to this day.Nothing in this set is worthy to be called great conducting, or anywhere close until the very end. For one thing, most of the collection is taken up by the scrappy Paris Conservatory Orch. I won't run down the details of the Liszt Faust Symphony, the Schubert Ninth, or any of the other routine readings until one gets to de Falla's El Amor Brujo at the end of CD 2. It is vivid and alive, and it gave me the most enjoyment, even in 1951 mono sound (quite clear and satisfying for its day). Poor Argenta, he should have put on a sweater!"
1,I cannot read this book because of scratches.,"It is really old book and previous owner draw a line almost all over the book. So it is hard to read this book. I bought this book for my brother in Japan. I believed the quality because I believe the Amazon, so I send this to my brother right after I got this book. After he open this he really angry at me. It was my fault send it without checking, but I really disappointed. I could not imagine that kind of book condition, because I didn't buy a book in *bed quality."
2,Buy as a gift,"If you have someone that is a Tami Hoag fan, her new book is good, if not, dont buy it just to read it, you will be lost. I have never read any of her books before and I was completely missing the point of the plot. Im sticking to my MAD magazines."
2,Too much characterization.,"Night Sins was non stopping mystery, looked forward to Guilty As Sin. Disappointed in the slower pace and too many non-essential descriptions"
2,"Interesting story, not worth two books to tell it, though","Night Sins held my interest. I was disappointed when the ending was obviously a ""come-on"" for another book. Guilty As Sin had a twist I wasn't expecting at the end, but generally character development was as expected"
3,Guilty As Sin,Followed Ms Hoag's usual format and delivered the story pretty much as expected. The plot lines were strong but the characters tended to be single dimensioned. I would like to see much more character depth and a little less format.
3,Unresolved suspense.,"I read both Night Sins and Guilty as Sin in the order they were written. Ms. Hoag spins an intricate web of mystery with twists and turns littering the path to the truth about who kidnapped a little boy in a Minnesota town. She also injects into the storyline romance fraught with secrets and obstacles for the main characters. Unfortunately Ms. Hoag does not answer all the questions that the plot poses. While the identity of the perpetrator of the crime is revealed, the books never delve into the whys and the hows. Instead, the reasons for masterminding a kidnapping and performing mind control on a child are summarized in a few vague pages. Since Ms. Hoag spent almost 1200 pages leading up the resolution she could have written a few more which explained the motives of the kidnappers."
4,I wish I had known,"I really enjoyed this book but I agree that some expansion could have been done regarding the ""kidnappers"" and what led them to their crime. My main complaint is that I had picked up both Guilty as Sin and Night Sins and had no idea Guilty as Sin was the sequel and read it first. There was no indication of that anywhere in the book. Should have visited amazon.com first!"
1,a lazy rehash of former work,"What a disappointment! I began reading mysteries only recently--Patricia Cornwell and P.D. James--but I ran out of their titles, so I picked up ""Night Sins"". It was adequate, but clever Tami hooks you into buying the ""second volume"", ""Guilty as Sin"". It is a transparent replay of the former, especially in male-female relationships...what a mess...Is it just me, or are all the females who dare to have careers punished in some terrifying way?"
1,"Time to die, birthday bitch","It's a great first sentence, I admit, but let's look at the rest of the book.I read the prologue and the first two chapters. Only 35 of its 606 pages, which violates my informal ""10% rule."" Did I read enough? Actually, I read too much. I was treated to overfamiliar cardboard characters, equally overfamiliar cliches, awkward language, cutesy language, wordy language, the telling of scenes that should be shown, and the showing of scenes that should be told. Hoag has been a regular on the best seller lists since 1988, but not because of anything I bought. I'm returning this to the book swap at the Jazz Pub here in Hangzhou and bringing home something else."
3,Good follow up but not as good as Night Sins,"This book finishes the story started in Night Sins. The movie based on this story actually includes only the first book and I guess it's for a good reason: Night Sins is way better than this one. Well, this one is entertaining but in comparison to the other one this one is boring. Read it if you need to know who is the master mind behind the crimes."
5,Guilty as Sin,"Great sequel to a great prequel! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it in four sittings. The characters are believeable (where are you Jay when I need you?) and although I would have liked Tami to continue the theme of Mitch and Megan more than she did, overall thought this a thoroughly entertaining book."
1,disappointment,"Well, I just discovered by skimming through the customer reviews that Guilty As Sin is a sequel. That explains the gaps in the story. The story is not generous at all. It definitely doesn't stand alone. As I read the book, I was able to skip over the descriptive part and just read the dialogue. That doesn't say much for the story. After all whether or not Ellen's blonde hair is coming out of her bun doesn't really advance the 'story'..."
3,Reviews by Nan Kilar - 3 1/2 stars for this one,"This is a continuation of Night Sins. Josh Kirkwood, the little boy that had been kidnapped, is returned to his home, but won't say a word to anyone about who took him or what was done to him. ADA Ellen North is sure Dr. Wright (a prof from the local college) is the mastermind. Will she be able to nail him? Add in other subplots, creepy characters, a wacko woman, and a few twists and turns of fate, and you get a story that's a bit too long, but most loose ends are tied up; or are they?"
4,Guilty as Sin,"I love reading Tami Hoag, she is almost as good as James Patterson-who is my favorite author. No doubt you can see I enjoy mystery,suspense andthrillers."
2,Big letdown,"I think Hoag's writing is fairly tight and she keeps the suspense moving along but the reading was simply not worth the final ending. One small cliched twist at the end does not justify over a thousand pages of reading (Between Night Sins and Guilty as Sin). The shame of it is that there were so many other interesting aspects of the story that could have been wrapped up but were not (vague here so as not to spoil): the role of other significant characters and leads that were developed throughout that led nowhere or were left unexplained. And how did these brilliant perpetrators become so clutzy in the end? On a second point, I don't object to the mixing of romance and thriller but this romance was a copycat of Night Sins with different characters: complete waste of time."
2,very disappointing,"I READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE OF A POSITIVE REVIEW IN A MAGAZINE AND I WAS EXTREMELY LET DOWN. THE CHARACTERS WERE SHALLOW AND THE PLOT WAS LAME. IT TOOK ME ABOUT 1 DAY TO READ IT BECAUSE I JUST FLIPPED THROUGH UNTIL THE ENDING. I HAD HEARD SHE WAS A GOOD AUTHOR, I WILL NOW AVOID HER LIKE THE PLAGE"
3,"If you have read ""Night Sins"", do not read this.","""Night Sins"" was my first exposure to Tami Hoag, which set my expectation level very high for every book of hers that I read after. The storyline and protagonist/antagonist intrigue will capture your attention, but only if you haven't read ""Night Sins"". If you are looking for a fairly well developed plot, a decent character description, this is for you. I highly recommend reading ""Night Sins"" instead of this one."
2,"Well paced, but predictable","Are you one of those readers who hates pesky surprises in their crime thrillers? Then this book is for you. Beautiful, single, dedicated-to-justice lawyer (of course) battles against her undeniable sexual attraction to ruggedly handsome writer (of course) while also having to face off with slick defense attorney who is also her ex-lover (of course). Not even mentioning suffering from frightening threats to her life (of course) by a sick, mysterious but ingenious criminal (of course) that you can spot as the one who did it when the character is first mentioned at the beginning of the book (of course). But in defense, it's a readable book that will occupy your time while you wait for the bus."
2,600 pages and a cliche on every one,"From the main character's general aspect (determined working woman and therefore lonely)to her romancer (suave, painfully handsome, southern scoundrel) to their very dialogue, these 600 pages are simply a heaping pile of cliche! An assistant prosecutor is designated to try the case of a child kidnapper, caught seemingly red-handed -- but the nightmare continues even after he is in custody. As they uncover their clues, the reader has to uncover the story, sifting through the junk heap of improbable chatter, stiff character description, and standard Steele-like love scenes. And it isn't even a mystery which leads you to the conclusion -- instead Hoag pulls a switcheroo. Heavily edited for useful text and characterizations, this 600 pager could become a more reasonable, and probably persuasive, book. But write like we readers have half a brain and want to use it! Don't challenge us to sort through unimaginative text for the story"
1,A Great Sleep Aid,I have never read anything by Tami Hoag before and I doubt that I will again.This story starts off slow and gets worse quickly. It is very rare that I don't finish a book once I have started it. I only made it 60 pages into this and it took me four days. It is really very boring. It might be good if one is having some problems with insomnia.
2,Could've been shorter,"This book is much too lengthy for comfort. Too many characterizations and side stories that could've been omitted and yet maintain the complete flow of the story. Only the last 100 pages are truly worthy of the word ""exciting"". Dissapoints"
3,"Good, Mystery, Laughable Romance","After having read ""A Thin Dark Line,"" and ""Night Sins"" I was ready for more of Tami Hoag. The story line of ""Guilty as Sin"" was just as good, but everytime it turned to the relationship between Ellen North and Jay Butler Brooks I was ready to toss the book in the trash. I don't think the author meant for the romantic parts of her book to be funny, but I found the situations totally laughable. They reminded me of the old Carol Burnett ""Went With the Wind"" skit. Tami needs to make up her mind whether she wants to write mysteries or romances. I vote for mysteries."
1,"Repetetive, boring and predictable.","Unfortuneately, I read this novel before Night Sins. Ms.Hoag, I feel, simply reused the same characters and the same plot. I feel like I should get my money back. It's a shame that a talented writer couldn't come up with a new story line."
3,"good mystery, awful romance","I've read many of Tami Hoag's books in the past and have always enjoyed them. This one, however, could have used a good dose of editing (as other reviewers have commented). While the mystery of the kidnapping and subsequent murder is well done, the romance between protagonist Ellen North and crime writer Jay Butler Brooks is really awful. The dialogue and general scenes between them were so poorly written as to be laughable, and that part of the story just didn't seem remotely credible. Hoag has done much better in the past, and I hope she'll get back on track for future efforts."
3,Too Many words,"The follow up To Night Sins has a lot of words and little action. The suspect is in jail awaiting a trail and is proclaiming his innocence. When a second abduction occurs it seems as he may be one criminal who is innocence of the crimes accused. The policedepartment and the FBI agencies keep working on the theory there are two criminals working together. They even try to pin the crimes on the father of the first child and Hoag does a great job of taking up space proving this theory. I wanted more action that would of kept me reading late until the night, sadly I skimmed huge sections of this book waiting for her to get back on track. The ending left me unsatisfied as the whodunit didn't support the evidence trail throughout this book."
3,Guilty of NOT having an Editor,"Tami Hoag's tale of a cold-blooded kidnapper wreaking havoc in a small Minnesota town, has a good plot, some excellent twists and turns, but is a very long-winded and often laborious read. A good editor could have streamlined this story. Prosecutor Ellen North is the well-developed central character of this entertaining and hard -hitting whodunit."
3,Repetitive of Night Sins,"I thoroughly enjoyed Night Sins, enough to immediately go out and purchase Guilty as Sin. I was anticiapting some answers to hanging questions from the first book, but the story lines were so similar that I had a hard time finishing. Only my desire to have my questions answered allowed me to finish this book. The author could have written one book with all (?most) of the answers. This is a good book on it's own, but not if you have already read Night Sins."
3,A Major let down!,"Well, What can I say. The climax and the plot was so lame. You could finish it all in one day. Hoag's books are usually pretty good. This book has a little romance and a lotta suspense. Some might like it, some might not. I can't wait to start NIGHT SINS (I did'nt see the TV mini-series)."
4,Highly recommended for Accounting 101,"I was taking an Accounting 101 course, and found many of the principles and equations being taught in the text to be confusing. If this sounds like you, then get this book. Everything is presented clearly and concisely, and it coincided with each chapter in my text book rather well.I ended up with a B in the course, and I'm sure it would have been a C (or worse) without this book.Four stars because there isn't an index, though."
5,Totally Rocks!,"My all-time favorite Santana album! Probably among the best compendium of super hard-rockin' Latin-Rock, Latin-Jazz music there is. All the musicians/singers perform flawlessly and with great flair. Great solo performances and tasteful mix of studio/live recordings. This album is a ""must-have"" and Under-rated!! Being a double CD means you get lots of music including all your favorites, no doubt."
5,NUCLEAR DRIVEN SOUND FOR THE ELEMENTS,"I first heard Transcendence at a friend of mine's house in late 1987. AND FROM THAT POINT ON I WAS BLOWN AWAY. Santana's guitar sings from the heavens above. Al Dimeola take a seat, Eric Johnson hold on just a second, Eddie VanHalen take a deep breath, let Santana on the stage."
2,A Bad Album.,"A bad Album compared with: Santana, Abraxas, Santana III, Lotus, Caravanserai ---> This albums are the best of Santana."
4,Muy excitante,"There's a wide range of moods here: takes a few spins to get into the overall flow, but the album certainly has flow. I bought Moonflower because I remember the live version of ""Black Magic Woman."" The Santana sound, with amazing percussion and guitar, comes through not only on this song, but on almost all the selections. You will find Carlos in top form. I dig the version of ""She's Not There."" What's more, many of the songs contain really impressive elements of jazz fusion. Overall, Moonflower is more readily accessible than Lotus (Lotus being an AWESOME but dense live masterpiece), and it's the kind of music that gets you up and jumping. Highly recommended."
5,Probably the best,"This is, in my mind probably the best Santana album in terms of material. If you could only get one Santana cd this should be it. What else can one say, buy it and see."
4,Moon flower power,"While I agree that Lotus is a superior work in many respects, it suffers from mixing problems, and tunes like Black Magic Woman, became long drawn out, lacking the fire of the Moonflower version.This also is the most latin sounding of Santana works, especially Flor D'Luna which is done in the best of the latin romantic tradition.Other stand outs are Greg Walker's soulful vocals on Transcendance, and Carlos' playing on El Morocco kills, turning the middle eastern flavored tune into a jazz-blues workout with Tom Coster.This cd for me, marks the end of very creative experimental era for Santana."
4,"Now He Sobs, Now He Sings","Hands down, this version of ""Europa"" is the most gut-wrenching, soulful instrumental song ever recorded - don't be surprised to find tears welling up in your eyes as it winds its way to its simultaneously mournful and hopeful conclusion. Carlos' crystalline guitar rings and roars throughout the album, but this piece alone is well worth the price."
1,poor quality ... save your money!!,"Worse movie ever ... quality was sub standard, worse than a home videofrom the 70's. CHEESEY songs ... unbearably slow, audio painful.And on top of all that, it's biased. Poor illegal aliens, breaking allour laws just to work. Or import drugs, prostitutes ... disgusting what they've done to our country.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!Can I get a refund AND compensation for suffering?Buy ""Border"" by film maker Chris Burgard. See the real story.Or move to Los Angeles ... see the impact of illegals."
2,Cochise County USA - Cries From the Border,This DVD was a disappointment. I thought it would cover the topic more in depth but there wasn't really anything there I didn't already know or couldn't have seen on the news.
4,Douglas Perspective,"As a bilingual family with European-Mexican origins that lives less than one mile from the Mexican/US border we feel that the documentary, ""Cochise County USA"", was quite accurately presented. On a topic that seems to arouse such intense emotions and racism on both sides of the issure it was refreshing to see a sensitive, intelligent and balanced report without the hysteria and rancor so often demonstrated on the News Programs. Wallace & Rosa Cooper, Douglas, AZ"
3,A spirituality of the head,"The author does a decent job of explaining a spirituality that is lifeless and spiritless. My own experience with the Lutheran service, eg., is one lacking a spontenaity and freshness that would appeal to younger adults and bring life into a slowly dying denomination.This book helps to explain in form and tone the head over heart lackluster, over intelectual roots of this orientation in Luther's abhorrence of works.The book explores a spirituality without any spirit, a tradition that sees works, including spriitual exercises, meant to help one feel the presence of God, as anathema. Religious experiences and symbols meant to connect the personal with the transpersonal, the ordinary with the transcendent are shyed away from as egocentric efforts to gain grace through our own efforts."
1,Nice idea but......,Needle broke first time I used one .Very easy to thread. Nice idea but not strong enough. Needs to be improved.
5,Help at last,"After spending many frustrating hours trying to thread a regular sewing machine needle, I tried two sizes of the self-threading needles. Even though there were no instructions on how these actually work, I had the needle threaded in just a few seconds. You can't believe how nice it is to be able to change thread color again and sew to my heart's content. Thank you!!!"
5,Exactly what I wanted,"This was a gift for my neice. it was excatly what she wanted so I was thrilled to be able to find it on Amazon. Incredibly though, I ordered it from my home in Australia just after I returned from a trip to New York. When I saw that it had been sent from Niagra Falls NY, where I had been the week before, I was astounded by the coincidence!!"
2,Not as good as the others,I've had several training kits. This one in particular is not the best one. The tubes are a little bir thin and weak. Try to get a training gear set that has thicker tubes. In that way your helicopter stands a couple of inches above the ground and ptrotects your landing skid.
5,Perfect,It fits the Syma S031 well but the helicopter has not been flown outdoors yet - waiting for warmer weather - late March or early April.
3,Broke after four or five landings.,"In this product's defense, the helicopter I was using was a bit too large; however, the reports I read stated that most of the choppers could not support the weight. The product seems somewhat flimsy; however, for the price, worked well enough if only for a limited amount of time."
1,No instructions. Did not fit,This training kit dis not come with any instructions. We had to look up instructions on several other websites before figuring out how to assemble it. The holes in the balls are too small for the metal rods to go through. We had to figure out all this before we figured out that it did not fit the model if rc helicopter we had purchased at the same time here on Amazon. Disappointed.
2,"The idea is there, the marketing is not.","Do not buy these for small helicopters. They are way to heavy, my landing gear continues to fly off as my Heli is in the air. I have finally decided to simply glue the gear to my frame(not fun when needing repairs)....."
1,cheap and worthless,well when it did come all i got was a plastic bag with cheap parts in it nothing on how to install broke in the process of being installed didnt even get to use the thing dont buy this if you wish to use it more then once
1,Don't waste your money,The center bracket (hub) is very weak and broke almost instantly. I see no reason that this bracket needs to be this weak. They designed it in a way that it would not stand up well to a hard landing. It's TRAINING GEAR for crying out loud. Look for something else which has a stronger center bracket or two full length rods instead of 4 like this one.
2,Micros Only!!,I bought this for my son because it showed up as an add on for the Double Horse Coaxial Helicopters....it is NOT big enough to hold one of those up!This set is for micros only and totally useless to us.If you're learning on a micro(why?)... this is pretty durable and should work well.
3,Usable Product,"This product works as described, but is only usable for large helicopters the Micro and Mini's cannot lift off of the ground when this is attached."
2,problems with the product I get incomplete,I want to tell you that I received my product incomplete because only received four yellow ball and two barillas product so can not be used in my helicopter.regards
1,useless,Makes no sense. No assembly instructions. I think some pieces are missing. Blasically 4 balls and 4 sticks and some small black plastic parts that don't appear capable of attaching to the sticks or the skids. Wish I saved my money and used ping pong balls and bread ties
2,Training Gear Set/Helicopter,"First of all, due to the nature of this product, it is probably purchased by beginners to this hobby. with that in mind, there are no instructions to its use and installation. there were little instructions as to which model of helicopter this product would work with. there needs to be more help."
3,"Not bad, could be better","The biggest issue I have with this product is that it lacks instructions on how to mount the training gear to the existing training gear, there were no pictures or anything. Putting it together is pretty straight forward, except for trying to figure out the orientation of the 4 mounting clips (again, no instructions, trial and error). The four fiberglass rods that hold the yellow balls come out of the center hub at a slight angle, so there is a question in my mind if the yellow balls should be on the ground, causing the rods to flex slightly or if they should be the other way, hovering just off the ground (I currently have it set in the later configuration...works pretty well). I never did get the clips to work or fit well, and had to use a little bit of tape to ensure that the rods stay secure to the existing gear. A few test flights around the living room have resulted in better landings and no tip overs."
2,Incompatible Products,"Seems to work fine on helicopters with landing bars. In the case of the Apache, it has wheels and the assembly does not fit the helicopter. I bought the Training gear because the page recommended it, but the training gear is not compatible with the helicopter at all."
1,MISSING PARTS,"The order came but without the rods, all it had was the balls and clips, so I ordered from another vender, for the price it was not worth returning..."
1,A Disappointment,"Presumably, these are for novice fliers, yet there are NO instructions to show the novice how to attach them. Whatever the method is, it's not intuitive. You would think the seller would read these comments and act accordingly, but nope, you're on your own. I would not recommend them."
3,Useful and hand,"For starters, the product arrived in a nice box but lacking any documentation. Still not sure if I was able to put it together correctly or not.Originally I was going to give it 4 stars but it was a pain to figure out how to put it together so I took it down one star.Once I put it together it integrates with my budget light nicely.I guess, the most difficult thing will be to figure out how to put it together and you will have to bend the wires due to the tension but then again...no documentation so I don't know if there was an easier way to put it together"
3,"Infesticons, The - Gun Hill Road","The Infesticons go for odd hip-hop on GUN HILL ROAD. ""Hero Theme"" has a nice retro funk bass on it, despite some odd gender-related lyrics, and the operatic vocals on ""Cave Theme""---singing about the Infesticons---is oddly hilarious. ""Quarterback Theme"" might have the best use of numerals as lyrics since the Boards of Canada's ""Aquarius."" And ""Tiger Theme,"" as short as it is, has a sprinkling of rock in it that makes it pop --- same goes for the bubbly pep of ""Shampoo Theme."" Liza Jessie Peterson goes bat-s**t crazy on ""Figurine Theme,"" while a different sort of craziness infiltrates ""Church Theme."" The moods on this album range wildly, keeping things interesting, if not cohesive. Eclectic, but uneven."
4,Fresh,"This album is fresh, that's all I have to say. From the moment it starts, until the end, the album is like nothing you have heard before. The lyrics are quite good, although not freestyle. And the cuts could be a little better. Otherwise, it really is complete. But what makes the album soo good is the electronica type music in the back. It adds a new flavour. When I mean fresh, I mean something new, something different. This is the type of album you wanna own first, so you can play it to all your buddies, and they would go ""who is this! "". And so you tell them...Infesticons."
5,Couldn't Put it Down!!!,"This book is incredibly motivating. I read it from cover to cover in one sitting!!! It has language that is easy to comprehend and to carry with you once you put the book down. I hear the words in my mind many times throughout the day. They have very thought provoking ideas that make you really stop and notice how you are conducting your life and what choices you make. Those choices, in turn, affect the rest of your day and so on. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a ""lift."" I also recommend it for team building ideas and motivation!!! It works great!!!"
5,The Title Says It All,"At first, I wondered about the title. How can anyone be better than their best? It struck me as catchy, but illogical. Then I started reading. Within moments--after reading the introduction and the first chapter, the authors had made a believer of me. It is possible to be better than your best. If you don't believe it, buy the book. It's a fun book to read. Lots and lots of excellent quotes. I particularly liked simple but powerful story Jay told about a lesson he learned at a candy shop with a word for the day. The book summarizes in simple but unforgettable language some of the most important truths we know about human motivation."
5,i've loved this album since i was a little girl,"I love this album. As a 7 year old I knew every word on the album. I just wish I could have it on cd so I could play it in my car and put it on my ipod. This is a wonderful selection of the best pop songs from that era sung by a wonderful selection of icons -- Rosemary Clooney (ain't nothing so funny as seeing a 7 year old girl from Indiana singing Come On'a My House!), Tony Benett, Cab Calloway (or Jumpin' Jive for that matter), Jo Stafford, Patty Paige... super yummy musical memories."
4,Relatively Flat Response Speakers,"These are decent shallow mount speakers. I replaced these for the rear factory speakers in my 97 Nissan Maxima. The sound that comes out of them is definitely much better than the factory installed speakers and the Infinity Speakers use much better quality materials. I'm sure that's to be expected. I'd say the response is relatively flat with and you can adjust the tweeter by 3 db with a button atop of the speaker.The installation could have been a bit more smooth and the instructions aren't anything more than some pictures that give you some sense of how everything should fit together depending on what installation scenario you are in. Keep in mind that the speaker grills that go with this are roughly the same size as the speakers themselves, so if you are putting them in a location that has a larger speaker grill, consider using the original grill as a cover.Overall, I'd say it's a decent product without taking up much space."
3,Installed in FJ Cruiser,"When these replaced the stock door speakers there was not a substantial improvement. But after adding an Infinity Basslink and 4 Polk db351s to the front and rear, the sound really woke up. Alone these didn't do much, but as part of an overall speaker upgrade they perform quite well."
3,Beach Boys: In London 1966,"I agree with the previous review about the sound but I will add that the actual film length is shorter since footage was repeated, ran backwards or sped up."
1,DVD Damaged,"This DVD contains 2 movies, one side movie is ""Cuando Viajan las Estrellas"" other side movie is ""El Rebelde"" this side is damaged, after watching half of the movie the rest is damaged. I would like to return the movie and get a new one or get my monie back. The link of the movie is: http://www.amazon.com/Cuando-Viajan-las-Estrellas-Rebelde/dp/B002OGMJOI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1350684616&sr=8-1&keywords=cuando+viajan+las+estrellas"
2,Cliff notes version of other architecture books,I can't think of an audience for this book. It's a terse refresher course on a bunch of different architecture books. It feels like the Cliff notes version of the Design Patterns book smashed together with the Cliff notes of Code Complete. You really have to understand the topics before you read this book. You will not learn them here.I can't imagine who I would recommend this book to.
4,Could this happen in my town?,"I like Gwen Hunter's fictional female doctor, Rhea Lynch. I agree with another reviewer that Hunter's books contain graphic medical details, but to write Dr. Rhea's stories any other way would be to take the easy way out.In this book, Dr. Rhea comes face to face with a fast-acting, virulent, and deadly virus that has her completely stumped. The first victims, an interracial couple, die within hours of being brought into Rhea's small emergency room in Dawkins County, South Carolina.But, they aren't the only ones to die and before it's all over, Rhea must use every ounce of her impressive medical talent and survival skills to save her town, her staff and herself from the evil that lurks in the shadows.Hunter keeps getting better. She and Dr. Rhea will make it to all the bestsellers' lists soon.I'll be reading whatever Hunter writes...she's a keeper....blood, guts and all!Enjoy!"
3,New Author for me,"I have seen the name, but never tried the author. It was a so so book for me. The backdrop was in the south, but got the idea the author didnt have a good handle on the area. I really got lost with who was in love with who. Hunter created a cast of characters with half of them sick or injured at one time of the other which made it complicated for me to follow the plot. At the end of the day, I think I best hang out with the dogs as they made the most sense."
4,This will keep you reading...,Kept my interest. Great medical mystery. Read both her books.! Wish there were more! I will keep checking to see when her next medical mystery comes out.
4,Prescribed Danger,"Great book. Correct knowledge of medicine, good suspense, Set in the South, where I am from, therefore I really liked the book!"
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Where oh where have the editors gone? There are errors, nonsensical terms, and all the fiction no-no's I can think of. The book is poorly written and follows a suspense formula. There are hints of romance but no chemistry between the main characters. Worst of all, the author tries to write in dialect. It is simply absurd. I admit I'm not fan of the romantic suspense, but there are good writers in the genre. This author is not one of them."
5,I love Susan Polgar's style,"Susan Polgar's commitment to sharing the game she loves is obvious. Her style of presentation is informative, illustrative, corrective, and easy to understand. This book is good for both the beginner and the intermediate chess player."
1,AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COST,"Do not BUY this book unless you are out of toilet paper and its snowing too much to go out and buy some! That is how bad this book is. And FYI: Chantelle Ried, who rated this book above, is a close friend of the Author. So DO NOT TRUST it!"
3,Good for starting out,The book is good although if you had bought Claire Sun-ok Choi's other book Designing Handcrafted Cards: Step-By-Step Techniques For Crafting 60 Beautiful Card you would have wasted yur money as every card is already in this book. The cards are basic and easy to make so this book is definitely geared more towards beginners rather than someone who has already been making cards and is looking for a little innovation or something different.
2,The Monster Book of Greeting Cards,"This book has been stitched together from other, older greeting card books, and like Frankenstein's Monster, the parts don't match. Claire Sun-ok Choi's delicate and beautiful quilling creations have been combined with potato prints, pressed leaf stationery, seeded-center flower cards, and vegetable kingdom collages that look very sixties (or third-grade, if the truth be told).Many of the cards suggested within this book have bits that will fall out of the envelope when it is opened, or won't even fit into envelopes and will have to be delivered by box.A wedding card included in this book has a zipper sewn between the photographs of the future bride and groom. It could also be used as a divorce announcement by unzipping the zipper.If you'd like to buy a book on quilling, I'd recommend Claire Sun-ok Choi'sArt of Paper Quilling: Designing Handcrafted Gifts and Cards. I'm sure there are other, better collage books out there, too."
5,Brilliant and subtle as usual,"wonderful human being as hero, brilliant swordplay, captures the human condition. Tatsuya Nakadai adds weight with an excellent performance and gripping showdownmy favorite series, always hits a home run"
4,For the Record,"This is an exellent album. Song number one sets up a great record from start to finish. The surf city type songs are a little over the top, but they still fit in well with the entire album. This is a refreshing and original album, during these hard times of musical slop. If you're looking for something that is pleasing to the ears and interesting, then I suggest you buy this album. If you're not familiar with Beachwood Sparks, then I suggest you look into them too. They have three albums and they're all great."
2,Could be worse,"""Best Intentions"" is a great tune with solid lyrics. Remainder is bland. Comparisons to Lou Reed in other reviews are fanciful. Best thing I can say is you don't need to fast forward much, these songs roll along in mediocrity."
3,The Tyde - 'Twice' (Rough Trade) 3 1/2 stars,"At least as good as their previous effort 'Once' (see my review). More or less, another helping of the Tyde's trademark neo-psychedelia. Never been able to figure out if the Tyde is a side-project for Beachwood Sparks or if it's the other way around. Either way, 'Twice' is worth checking out - looking at the asking price here. You can't go wrong. Tunes I was most impressed with were the catchy ""Henry VII"", ""Best Intentions"", ""Takes A Lot Of Trying"" and ""New D"". Any of you familiar with Asteroid No.4? They put out a CD sort of like this one, called 'Honeyspot'."
5,Fantastic!,"I love the book "" Smoothies"" by Anne Akers Johnson. Smoothies are the new ""craze"" in our town . They are so expensive to buy at the smoothie ""cafe's"", so I decided I wanted to make my own.. This book has 22 recipes that are all absolutely delicious! I recomend that you buy it, now!"
2,"not much of a ""recipe"" book","WARNING: This ""cookbook"" does not have ""recipes."" All it does is list some fruits and juices under generic smoothie names. It gives you some measurements and leaves the rest for you to do. There is a page or two showing you the generalized smoothie making process at the beginning, but there is NO substantial ""cookbook"" fare. But I mean... what else can you expect from a smoothie book? Nonetheless I was very disappointed with it."
2,Easily broken,"Bought this for my nephew and he loves it, however the green plastic piece that holds the pops is very cheeply made. The portion of this piece that the metal stands snap into, broke right off the first time a bag of frozen corn accedentaly fell on it. Now we have to prop it up in the freezer against other things to make it work. Other than that, we are pleased with the way the pops turn out. If you have enough freezer space to let this stand alone with nothing touching it, you should not have a problem."
5,Perfect!,"These popsicle molds are great! The ships are the perfect size for small children to both hold and eat. I've used them with my nieces and my kids at school - ages ranging from 2-6. Sometimes it's tricky to find popsicles that the kids can finish before they melt and these are simply perfect. The little recipe book that comes with the kit has yummy recipes that the kids like, and they love coming up with their own popsicle ideas. I like that juice and yogurt replace the sugary ingredients of store bought treats. Win, win!"
5,"Still not perfect, but","Based on the reviews I've read and the many many retractable ID holders I've owned, none hold up too well except by chance. These have been no exception. But at least they were slightly cheaper per reel.That's not a great review, but this isn't a great product, no matter who makes it."
2,Mostly disappointing,"I am a fan of the Muppet Show from when I was a kid, and I am usually a huge Steve Martin fan, but this collection just doesn't have much to offer. I've seen one of the other collections (with Harry Bellafonte, John Denver and Linda Ronstadt) and thought it was good. But this one is weak. Steve Martin is saddled with terrible writing that he barely manages to make funny. Carol Burnett is just bad. The only saving grace on this disc are the scenes with Gilda Radner. Gilda was a genius, and she shines in each of the bits she's in."
1,Season 1 coming August 8,"Don't spend the overweighted price for these out-of-pruduction ""Best of..."" DVD's, Season 1 of the Muppet Show will be released on DVD beginning August 8, and the other seasons will be released soon after."
2,America You're Being Ripped Off!,I have just purchased a Region 2 (English) Muppet Four-pack that has SIX episodes per disc - totalling 24 episodes in all! Why do you Americans have to make do with 50% less? Search out the Region 2 collection for far better value for money!Ps. the contents of my set are excellent.
3,Great physiological explanation of essential oil use,The physiological explanations for the various parts of the body was very educational. The oil descriptions were thorough and useful in their descriptions of the methods used for for the various effects wanted. I would have loved to see a more complete listing of oils. This is the books' only weakness. I enjoy it and use it often for reference.
3,Good but not THAT good!,"If you have wide feet be sure to ask for one wider size the least...I always try to buy 2E but in this case I had to be 4E because the first few uses before break in they were a bit uncomfortable, after that, they are OK."
4,Fantastic voice - great charisma - excellent concert.,"ANGELA GHEORGHIU - LIVE FROM COVENT GARDEN, LONDON.The opening song is LASCIA CH'IO PIANGA from Händel's opera RINALDO. It's a very beautiful song.DEPUIS LE JOUR is a amazing. Angela Gheorghiu has great charisma with a lovely smile.UN BEL DI, VEDREMO from MADAM BUTTERFLY by Puccini. Angela has a fantastic voice, with warm and fullness.ECCO: RESPIRO APPENA. LO SON L'UMILE ANCELLA. Angela sings it marvellous.Angela sings CASTA DIVA live on stage The song is also as a special music video on this DVD. This is a very impressive song, with a quietness you don't find in pop/rock music. The song has the time it takes to blossom beautifully. Angela's voice is very beautiful.Puccino's O MIO BABBINO CARO. Is one of the most beautiful arias. It's so wonderful.The final song is I COULD HAVE DANCE ALL NIGHT from MY FAIR LADY. It's a lively and lovely song.This is a wonderful concert and the sound on the DVD is excellent."
2,Night off,"Angela Gheorgiu sounds uncomfortable in this live performance. Te evening gets off to a bad start with Handel and Mozart, and even in the idiom which is usually her srength (e.g. Puccini), she sounds careworn and struggling with pitch."
3,toybox review,"Box was much smaller than I expected. Some screws were not easy to put in. It does hold a fair amount of toys, the lid doesn't go up more than half way. It works for what we need, but is not my ideal."
4,More photographs than in-depth information,"There's no doubting Hugh Johnson's position as one of the leading wine writers (and appreciators) of our time. This book is a little misleading however, for it is not the in-depth exploration of the Italian wine explosion one expects from Johnson's past works. This book focuses more on Andy Katz' exceptional photographs of one of the lovliest wine regions of the world. Johnson's prose is an homage to Tuscany more than a technical exploration of just what has caused the stunning advances is the region's wine production over the past 20 years. Johnson gives insights into many fine properties, but if you're expecting an expansion on Johnson's encyclopedia of wine's Tuscan entry you will likely be disappointed. Think of it more as a heartfelt appreciation of Tuscan wine and culture -- it's almost poetic in its mesh of prose and photography."
3,"good pictures, poor text","3 stars is the average between 1 star for the text, and 5 stars for the pictures. Don't get me wrong Hugh Johnson is a good writer and very knowledgeable about French, but what about Italian wines? I just wanted to warn any potential buyer that this is mostly pictures (very beautiful indeed), as the text is very brief and not particularly well researched."
4,Everything Parent Guide To Sensory Intergration Disorder,So very helpful when you need a information to put everything in order. This book is easy to understand and helpful even when you see the doctors or therapists - it helps you stay in tune with what is happening to your child and takes the mystery out of the problem.
3,It was okay!,I really wanted a book that would explain SPD for a toddler instead of school age. Bi have a Grandson that was diagnosed with this at 16 months and this book didn't really help me understand this disorder.
5,Very Nice and Sturdy!,"This is a very nice product that is very sturdy, well built, easy to assemble, and safe. I have looked at a number of toy boxes safe for a toddler, and most are either tacky looking or not very sturdy. This one is very attractive and being natural wood tone, it blends well with other furniture and doesn't look tacky."
5,"Nice Looking, Sturdy and Safe for Little People",My husband and I bought this for our one year old at Babies R Us after first seeing it on this website. But when I went to pick it up at Babies R Us the display toy chest looked dirty and grungy and unattractive so I reconidered buying it but when we saw ours it looked so much better like the one on this website. The color is beautiful and appears to be made of solid wood. The hinges are spring loaded so that it opens and closes slowly and won't slam on little fingers. For safety reasons it also has openings around the top. It was also easy for my husband to assemble... I applaud it's safety and beauty and recommend it highly.
3,good,my husband reads these western bools and his comment was the book was good. he read all five books and said the same for all.
1,Terrible!,"This stuff was awful! I let my three and ten year olds ""play"" with it and we were all very disappointed. It doesn't stick to itself, so molding it into any sort of shape is impossible. It's really just like sand - crumbly and messy. After we made a huge mess and spent half an hour trying to get the moon sand off hands and faces, we threw it away and I got no complaints about that - even from the three y.o. Buy some Play Doh instead!"
1,Roughhewn Sand,"I bought this 3-pack last night for my 4 year old, and couldn't be more disappointed. The sand is just that... sand. Messy sand. It won't mold, won't squish, won't... anything, really. It's colored. It has glitter. We took the top off a pizza box so that our son could mess around with it without getting this stuff everywhere, and he smartly added drops of water to it to see if he could get it to do something, but now it's just glittery wet sand. Thankfully, he maintains that this water now represents water basins at his magical sand quarry. He's also decided that a dump truck will be coming soon to take it all to the dump.I hadn't planned to write a review, but was on the computer searching to see if there was something we needed to do to the sand to make it malleable, but seeing nothing to remedy this situation, I can rest satisfied that this product is simply worthless."
5,Worth the money!!!,"This is my one of my best purchases of the year. There is a Sharper Image model that is similar for $199, walk into a Sharper Image store and put your iPod into each unit you won't even think about saving the $100 the sound quality on this one is unbelievable compared to others. We have music playing all the time and to have this with your custom iPod playlists for any party, event or even a little background music at dinner I couldn't live without it. Oh and the compliments we receive it's on every friends wishlist this Christmas! If you get a chance go to a Sharper Image and just have a listen you probably won't leave the store without it! This my first ever product review I love it that much."
4,Holly Brook - Like Blood Like Honey,"For Holly Brook's classification in Music- Female Folk/sort of jazz avenues is actually very good. She sort of has the same quality as Suzanne Vega, however her lyrics aren't as metaphoric as Vega's she's still does a very good job in her performance. I also was quite impressed with her vocal range. I found this CD quite enjoyable and relaxing to listen to."
3,Too Much Detail,"I love history and I love Impressionists paintings, so I should have loved this book, but I didn't. It just had too much detail about people and events that didn't seem relevant to the story. The author did a great job of researching, and I don't know if I can blame him for putting in the detail he did, but for me, reading this book was a slog. I had to force myself to finish it. I did learn a lot about French history, art, and society, but I felt like I had read a textbook."
4,good condition for second-hand,have not read it yet but Ross King's writing and story-telling is highly acclaimed so am looking forward to doing so
2,No plates and many typos,"Although the book is entertaining, I am surprised at the huge number of typographical errors that appear in the Kindle version. Not having the hard copy, I don't know if these errors are in the original publication but names are misspelled throughout as well as common words. These errors are repeated. Words such as intuition, unfortunately, prostitute appear as inmition, unformnately, prostimte, respectively. The architect of the Paris Opera is Charles Garnier but in the book is Gamier. There are many more of these errors.In addition to this, in the Kindle edition, plates are referred to but do not appear. Since this is a book on painting, this is indeed important and a pity that they do not do so."
3,Art history as MTV,"My husband read this, and passed it along. While I finished the book, I found slightly infuriating: Chapters are short, occasionally the book reads like a guest list at a fancy party and nothing is treated in any kind of depth. To top it al off, there are too few reproductions of the art discussed. In all, a decent view into the rise of Impressionism but, not one with great soul."
4,Engaging Perspective,"This is good book on its own, but a great reference for those who wish to know more about the area. The is so much emphesis on the Impressionist Movement itself that there is very little information about the times and events that made the movement such a revolution. Art historians talk of the Salon, but a laimen may not grasp its importance, which King does. The only regret I have about the book is how little King speaks of The Commune. It was a devestation to the people and city of Paris and again very little is known. King addresses it, but fails to deliever with respect as to how the artists responded to the disaster."
4,A perfect introduction,"This is a perfect book for those of us who want to know more about the recent history of Western Art and specifically the impressionists. Art historians will all undoubtedly find fault; this is not a university text book, it's a wonderfully written overview of the struggles and eventual rise of the impressionist art movement in France. No it doesn't cover every impressionist who lived but you'll recognize the ones it does mention. It is written so well that I suspect it'll encourage many readers to ""dig deeper"" into the subject matter."
5,A Real Pageturner...oddly enough for a biography,"I'm nowhere near an artsy type, but this book was so compelling and interesting! I found myself thinking 'what's gonna happen next? will manet ever sell a painting?' And I had no idea Manet, Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, and Degas all knew each other. But even more surprising was that I'd never heard of Meissoniet. I've checked some of his works and they really are very good.The thing about art is that there's room for all types of expression. We humans are too complex to feel only one way every day. What Manet and the rest did was share their point of view. Anybody can look at a field, but it's the personal take that turns it into art. None of us see the same thing.I listened to this on audio, and the narrator is wonderful. It was 13 cd's but they flew. Books like these may not be for the connoisseur, but they're great for waking up the masses. And if no one understands what you're saying, you may as well keep yer yap shut. Eh? Right? Y'know?"
4,Breathes life into our favorite French Impressionists,"Ross King, who recently spoke at the Margaret Mitchell house in Atlanta, does a marvelous job bringing to life our favorite-and not so favorite-Impressionists as they grew and developed during the course of the Empire period in France. Instead of the dry, dusty recitation of facts and figures of the players during this period of the experimentation in painting(though he certainly sites his original material in copious footnotes), he animates the sometimes cardboard images we have of the artists that dominate our current art scene and draw thousands to the mega exhibits in Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and DC. The roll of the historic dice means we no longer vernerate the detail-orientated works of Ernest Meissonier, the lauded artist of the period, but instead worship at the altar of Manet, Renoir, Cezanne and Monet who were regarded as rabel at the time. This one is a keeper..."
5,Fassbaender's best Schubert,"After she retired from opera, Birgitte Fasbaender devoted herself almost completely to lieder swinging, at which she became a renowned mistress of the art. In this relatively early Winterreise (1988) she takes on a man's cycle with complete conviciton and authority. Indeed, the advantage of a woman's voice comes in greater flexibility and agility--I've never heard anyone negotiate Schubert's leaps and runs with such courage and panache. This artist can be emotionally overbearing, but here she reins in the desperation and anguish of the cycle. Even so, hers is a wrenching interpretation. Her long-time accompanist, Albert Reimann, isn't on her level; his palying is striaghtforward to the point of bluntness. This is one Winterreise entirely carried by the singer, but Fasbaender is more than equal to the task."
2,"fine item, but seriously overpriced by the seller","This product is fine, but the seller charges over 2x the price on the manufacturer's website (where the product can also be ordered, incidentally). A curious choice for a relatively simple product..."
5,So sturdy!,"After having yet another plastic laundry sorter fall apart on me, I decided a serious investment was in order. Do NOT waste your money on plastic ones! It took probably about 15 min to assemble, and the tools are included. The only thing I wish was a little big different is that I the bags could be a little taller. That said, they easily hold a full load of laundry, if not a little more. And I am no longer worried if it actually going over the top, because this thing is not going to fall apart from being loaded up! The other nice thing is the hanging bar - I didn't think I would really use this, but I have thrown a few blankets over it to finish drying and it was much handier to hang dress shirts on right out of the dryer than the pipe I used to use."
4,Pretty good quality,"I got this to help my girlfriend organize her laundry room. It works very well for what it is. The construction quality is good, but not superb. If you have the room and need organizing you can't really beat this.It really took no time at all to put together and seems that it will last quite a while."
4,This product is what it appears to be.,"The cart works great. It is sturdy and holds about a load per bag. The metal frame is strong and should last a long time. I did accidentally rip one of the bags while putting it together which is why I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, but I have had no other problems with it. Assuming that it continues to hold up well I would recommend it, but I have only had it for three weeks."
4,"Good quality, good price","Seville Classics SHE16165 3-Bag Laundry Sorter Cart With Hanging BarThis laundry sorter has all of the features I wanted and more. The adjustable bar is great for hanging clothes on hangers when unloading the dryer or for clothes that you don't want to put in the dryer. Sturdy frame and wheels, heavy canvas, washable bags are removable and have handles for easy carrying if you want to take just one or for sorting and delivering clean clothes to different areas of the house. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because there are 4 plastic connections for the hanging bar. The plastic pieces are pretty flimsy and one cracked as I assembled the cart."
4,good quality,"Pros: Sturdy metals & wheels. Bag fabrics are good.Easy to move around.Cons: Metals have manufacturing odor in the beginning, but do air them out for a few hrs.Hanging bar should be easier to move it."
4,good buy( high quality),"I did my homework by researching all the laundry carts on internet before I ordered this one. I love this Laundry Sorter Cart; it is veryn functional, pretty, high quality and stable. It's not made in China; it's make in Taiwan. I give 4 starts instead of 5 starts is:..... the break friction of the wheel is not strong enough when my kid is able to move the cart even the break is ""ON"". Over all; it's a good buy."
5,Great Item...Very durable!,This was easy to put together and the chrome pieces were very solid. Amazingly good! I am very pleased with this laundry bag compared to the last one I had.
5,I don't know how I lived without it.,I put this together myself in just a few minutes. It is so strong and durable. I store empty hangers on the bar and have used it to dry sweaters. It's the greatest invention for the laundry room since the laundry basket.
4,Great Laundrey sorter!,I purchased this item because I wanted to separate my hand wash items from my whites and colored clothes. Works out great since my husband now can tell what is to be handwashed. I have one small problem with this item and that is the left bar that clothes hangs upon does not fasten tight enough which sometimes allows the bar to slide down. I also like the way you can remove the canvas and wash them. Over all it is a Great purchase.
3,Hanging bar broke...,"Right out of the package, I started to assemble this laundry sorter. When I connected the hanging bar, it cracked on both sides! The sorter itself is really nice. I like the metal bars beneath the bags, because it gives a lot of support to the bags, making it so that they won't rip from being too full. The bags can easily be taken out individually so you can carry them to the washer if needed.I duct taped the hanging bar on, and it hasn't fallen off yet, so I give this product three stars."
1,Dishonest seller,"At a listed price of $14.49 it looked like a great deal. I almost clicked on the one click purchase button, but my gut feeling told me that this must be too good to be true. Instead, I put two in my cart and then went to check out. There I saw that the shipping and handling was $163.98, for a grand total of $192.96 for two. This is a crooked, dishonest, sleazy, underhanded, fraudulent sales tactic. I wouldn't buy anything from these crooks."
2,Hope you don't need to hang anything wet!,"I purchased this laundry cart about 6 months ago. At first, all was well. It seemed like a solidly built cart, however, after about 2 months, all of the plastic fittings on the hanging bar started to crack and break and now the bar will not stay in the ""up"" position even with hardly ANY weight on it. It wont even hold dry clothes. I am now using garage spring clamps to hold it up. With a six month manufacturers warranty, this cart will last you just long enough so that the warranty runs out."
4,Sturdy and Useful Product,"I am very pleased with this purchase. The cart is well made and sturdy. It was easy to assemble and has roomy laundry bags for sorting. Even though it is in my laundry room, I like the fact that it rolls, which makes it easy to clean under/around."
5,"High Quality, Sturdy","Pleasantly surprised how nice this is. Easy to assemble.Laundry is not fun but this makes it a lot easier, for sure.I love it!"
5,Great,"Love this hamper, very sturdy...works perfect for my laundry room. The adjustable bar to hang clothing to dry is a nice feature."
3,Great Cart / Terrible Plastic Connections,"This cart works great and has nice commercial grade casters that roll smoothly even outdoors. The biggest problem is the CHEAP plastic sleeves that connect the cross bar to the upright bars. They both broke on the first day of use. Rather than bothering to call the company and ask for two more worthless plastic connectors that would just break again; I went down to the hardware store and bought two PVC T connects that are durable and it works great now. It doesn't look as nice, and it is ridiculous that for close to $100 they can't come up with something better. I love the cart now, but wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't have the skill set to fix the plastic connector problem."
3,a little thin..,"I have had many laundry sorters and they usually are wobbly and weak...this is one is very sturdy. I just worry about the quality of the material for the sorters...a little thin. Overall, best sorter I have bought!!"
1,Disappointed shopper,I just got the laundry sorter two weeks ago and washed the bags and they all opened at the seam. I am so disappointed with the quality of the bags.
2,disappointed,"i bought this for sorting laundry and hanging stuff that needed to air dry. I was VERY upset to learn how easily the bags would tear!!! All 3 bags tore after about 1 month and VERY minimal use!!! I have been letting this sit unused since then debating what to do, now that I have a sewing machine I guess i'll just repair it."
5,Excellent product,"This product was just as described. I would defintely recommend getting this if you are looking for a durable sorter. The bags holds about a weeks worth of clothes. Also, very easy to put together."
5,Great Quality and well designed,"I didn't want to spend this much money at first for something just to sort dirty laundry... but I've found it to be an incredible improvement over using baskets. I'm thinking about getting another one too for others in my household as the top bar is great for drying clothes and pre sorting your clothes as you use them, more of a time saver/convenience than I thought it could ever be and the bags are much easier to carry around than bulky baskets. The construction is surprisingly heavy duty. This is the third Seville Classics product I've purchased through Amazon and I've been very happy with them all."
5,amazing,This one of the best purchased I have made on amazon. It is sturdy and works so well. Thanks for producing a strong product.
3,Replaced parts three times. Customer service is good though.,"Seville's customer service has been very responsive and helpful (via email). They replaced broken parts on three different accounts.You have to be careful raising and lowering the horizontal hangar bar so that you maintain a 90-degree angle at both upper corners. The slightest unevenness will snap both of the plastic corner pieces.I've replaced the two clamps that hold the vertical poles in place; Those parts aren't designed well. If they break again, I'll probably make something myself to hold it in place. I'm thinking a piece of hose, wrapped with a pipe clamp will do the job. The height won't be adjustable anymore."
5,So convenient,"This is a little expensive for a laundry hamper but well worth the money. It is very sturdy and moves smoothly on the wheels. The bags give ample space for sorting colors, whites etc. The hanging rack can easily be raised or lowered and is very stable once loced into position."
5,So useful and compact!,"Great product! Sturdy and bags are durable. My washer/dryer is located in the kitchen in a closet, so this sorter cart sits in the corner of the kitchen. It's discreet, simple, and the retractable bar is a great addition!"
3,Great at first,"I purchased this item a few months ago, great construction, awesome laundry bags can hold alot and very durable. Now the bad part, I purchased this item because as I do my laundry I like to hang things as I go. As you can see from the picture there are black brackets on the side for adjusting the hanging bar. These brackets hold at first but you have to adjust them on a regular and that was fine since I only do my laundry maybe once a week. But now I can get the brackets to hold and the bar just keeps sliding down. This is a very expensive laundry rack and for the price I shouldnt have to brain storm on how toget the hanging bar to stay up."
2,Good for 3 years,"I've had this for 3 years now. Two wheels fell off :( I loved it before the wheels broke. I don't know whether I buy this one again. After looking at a few other ones out there, this one may still be the best bet. I am just hoping the 2nd purchase will last me another 3 years."
4,Excellent Product,I was really impressed with the price and quality of the product. It was on sale with a free shipping they even lower than Costco.
4,lighter and less thick than I expected,"The logo is not on the sleeve but a small N next to the front packet.I expected it to be thick but it is just like a normal fleece, very light. However, there is a tag written with ""Nautex techonology"" which makes it twice warmer and twice performace. I don't know if that is true but it seems the fabric is more dense than a columbia fleece I have. I guess that is why its original price is $85."
2,A couple problems,"After making a strong case that Boxers need specialized training, there seems to be little in it particular to the Boxer. I wonder if this is just an edit off one of the other Barron's books.Two, the author pushes treats as training rewards, which many believe isnt the best.Three, on some topics, like handling aggression, the author just punts - 'consult an expert.' Not very helpful.All in all, I prefer the Monks of New Skeet, and ""The Art of Raising a Puppy."""
1,Started strong but died.,"That says it. The first few chapters were ok, but after that it got so tedious that I couldn't finish it."
2,Too one sided to be a truly great book,"I must confess that I both oppose the war and consider myself to be quite liberal. This collection of letters is quite intriguing, and we certaintly can not discredit it as the letters come from real troops with real concerns. I must fault this book, however, because the book clearly does not give a complete picture of the sentiments of our troops. In a time when we really need to reconcile the differences between ""Red"" and ""Blue"", or liberal and conservative, this selection of letters does little for that goal. A more accurate representation of the letters Moore recieved, with both sides of the argument, would have made this a far more useful read. Overall I would say read this book for what it is, a selection of letters from disenchanted troops, and try not to let it's clearly liberal leanings boil your blood."
4,Read Moore AND Annenberg,"Mark in Memphis, you might want to check the Annenberg site again: ""October 16, 2004. Service Members, Families Say Pentagon Sent Too Few Troops To Iraq, Stressed National Guard and Reserves, Should Allow Photos of Coffins at Dover."" There's always another part of the story--this book is simply one part, meant to be taken along with other sources for a full picture."
4,Letters from the Soldiers,"This book is a great book that must be read. It consists of letters written by soldiers who have served or are serving in Iraq, giving them the opportunity to express themselves. For once soldiers get to speak out, by sharing their stories that will make you feel compassion. Amazingly, the majority of the letters are from soldiers who voted for Bush and are or were very conservative. It is the words of the soldiers, if we cannot trust them, then whom can we trust?"
3,Excellent Story Idea - Very Redundant,"I want to say that I think Michael Moore is an amazing writer and director. Unfortunately, this book just doesn't cut it. I understand the idea behind the book, but it was so redundant (understandably).More GIs and Reservists than you can shake a stick at took the time to reveal their reservations about the Iraqi War, their crummy treatment, their shortages and the misjudgements of Bush, to Michael Moore. If these soldiers can find Michael Moore, why can't ABC, NBC, or CBS find them?"
1,Can you take away 2 more stars?,"Wow, it's a book from a spiteful and arrogant lib. If you enjoy this kind of book, I really do feel bad for you. For as much railing against the president that Micheal ""The Red"" Moore does, he can certainly thank Pres. Bush and A LOT of confused, impressionable small-world thinkers for making him a very, very rich liberal. Military folks (by and large, and speaking from first hand knowledge) aren't fooled by the B.S."
1,Support the troops,"Pathetic whining is not a dignified response to hardship. If those in Osama bin Moore's book are really soldiers (doubtful), they should be ashamed of themselves. Save your money. Instead of buying this book, send your $14.96 to the USO (that's United Service Organizations for you in the blue states)."
1,Kind of Puts Things in Perspective,"I've read it. All I could think about was the fools who threw themselves against Mare's Heights, the idots that sacrificed themselves at Cold Harbor and the imbiciles who stormed the beaches at Normady.Soldiering sure has changed since my day. Used to be ""when the going gets tough, the tough got going."" Now its ""When the going gets tough, [...]Does Moore or these [...] have any idea what the difference between low and high intencity warfare is and what our forefathers had to contend with?"
3,What about the other side?,"A book is good when it just have one side of the argument, the book is better when you have both side of the argument. I am sorry Moore, even though some of the letters are heart breakening, I still want you to see and present the other side of the arguments.Also I hope some of the soldiers as well as their family getting a part of the book royalty"
5,Excellent for what it is,"This book is excellent for what it is...letters and insight into the lives of US soldiers and their families. It is just more infomation I needed from the source instead of from our biased media and President. More information is perhaps scary for some people, but it also helps us make more informed choices. Many people don't like Moore, but if there was another author's name on this book, I'm sure it would get great reviews. Don't confuse the book for it's cover."
3,emozionante...,"I am following this insane war from my country,Italy, which is involved in a so called ""peace establishment"". I read this book that I found touching because says things that I already sensed. I knew that most of the soldiers fighting miles away from home weren't aware of the lies of their President. This is a great ""real"" book, I finished it in two days, I just could't stop reading and thank you to M. Moore to let us know the truth."
5,He did again. Superb Book.,"Michael Moore's book: This book is composed completely of letters from soldiers in Iraq that were written to Michael Moore or to their families that Michael Moore has published. I liked reading the informal first hand views of the soldiers about the war, views that the American media chooses not to show us."
1,Shameful,"Reading this book made me sad. This man is AGAIN exploiting emotion in order to make money. Moore now has about 5 or 6 products on the market about this topic and he is getting rich off of every single one. He is quoting U.S. Army men and women, and reading from these letters in his cross country tour, but what he is not saying is that the average price for him to speak at one of these engagements is $30,000 plus expenses,(look it up). People in this country need to stop being taken advantage of FROM BOTH SIDES LIKE THIS!"
1,70% of Military Families Support Bush,Clearly there is something wrong when an AP poll of military personnel and their families comes back 70% in favor of Bush while this book contains none of their comments yet claims to speak for the military families in general.'Nuff said.
1,Calling all Michael Moore fans!,"Please go to Iraq, visit a victim of one of the recent terrorist bombings there and tell that person what good people the Iraqi insurgents are. Tell them that they are fighting for the freedom of Iraq and that their numbers will grow and they will win. Go ahead. Tell them!"
1,ARE YOU PEOPLE SERIOUS???,"How anyone can call this piece of crap ""an accurate representation of US soldiers thoughts"" must be on crack. First of all, this is a piece of ""FICTION"" from Michael ""I hate Republicans, President Bush, America and everything it stands for"" Moore. What happened to all the ""other"" letters from military men & women who support and love their country? Conveniently left out? This is the type of propaganda which causes not only simple minded Americans, but uneducated and un-knowledgeable foreigners to think negatively about America and our way of life. This ""piece"" of work by Moore should be taken as exactly what it is....a one-sided, un-original blathering from someone trying to push a minority agenda!Thank you Michael, I sometimes forget how stupid you are until I am reminded by things like this!"
5,Finally!,"Thank you Michael Moore. The world as a whole resents our government for forcing our military upon this country. The American People resent our govenment for leading us into a war based on false pretenses and political spin, simultaneously pulling our nation from internation treaties and alienating long-time allies. Now it becomes clear just how much the soldiers, the force behind the american government, the so-called American superpower bent on world domination, disagree with the politics behind the war they are there to fight. It becomes clear that they are as frustrated as the American public as a whole at the lack of direction and guidance through this conflict from their commander-in-chief. It becomes clear that they feel that they are forced to be there, forced to fight for a cause that they don't have faith in anymore. The stories they tell are frightening. I love my country, but in this respect it seems America is abusing its power."
4,Moving and powerful,"One shouldn't look to this book for an unbalanced view of how all those in the military feel about Iraq or American politics. That is not its purpose, nor does it purport to speak for all soldiers stationed in Iraq. What the book does, instead, is allow us to peek inside the lives of some of the individuals who are fighting this war, rather than see them as faceless people. The book succeeds as extending some of the most captivating moments of Fahrenheit 9/11-- those moments when Moore stopped talking and let the images and voices of the soldiers stationed in Iraq carry the story he wished to tell. It is a moving, powerful, and visionary collection of something most of us would never get to see otherwise."
3,Good Try,"It seems like Moore got a bunch of soldiers who were extremely angry at the president and let them have at it. None of these soldiers seemed too concerned with US strategy and how important it is to defeat terrorism, but were quite obsessed with what kind of scoundrel George Bush is. Moore is so overtly biased it is hard to believe anything he says.He makes the left look silly.Anybody can gather a bunch of hate letters against the administration and make it into a book. It's harder to find real answers. Moore is not concerned with answers. He just loves to grandstand and thumb his nose at the administration.Sure, Bush needs criticism, but let's have more intelligent debate. Moore carries the debate to a grade school level."
2,Simply Not Effective.,"This book isn't effective for the pure reason that it represents less than one one-thousandth of a percentage of the United States military. For all we know, bags of letters could have been written to Moore supporting the war, outraged at him for embarrassing the country, asking him why he doesn't care about Democracy for the Iraqi people, but that would nullify his argument.On Overstock.com, ""most people"" who bought this book also bought a Titan Scooter, but that's probably not representative of his book buyers either.Patriots don't lie.2 stars for the original idea."
5,Heartfelt and genuine,"""Will they ever trust us again"" is an awesome collection of correspondences from a wide variety of individuals across the globe, writing to Michael Moore about the war in Iraq. This book will, undoubtedly, go down in history as a ""primary source"" book to analyze letters (or e-mails, for that matter) from soldiers and family members during a time of international crisis.The book is nicely compiled, easy to follow, certainly very heartfelt and genuine. It is quite clear there is much resentment in the hearts of the American people...The only question now is: What to do about it??"
2,Audio Edition is Too Abridged And The Narration Could Have Been Better!,"I also listened to the audio recording and I agree that the story was fine but I also agree that the narrator's lack of British accents was a bit odd. Why would a company put out British Historicals and Regencies on audiobook and not use a narrator who has a British accent? They should rerelease this and use a British narrator or find someone who knows how to put one on and another thing is that this book has been extremely abridged on this tape, it is only one tape and approximately ninety minutes so though I love listening to audiobooks I also love to read and I would recommend you buy paperback or hardcover editions instead so you will get the full story. Why an unabridged audiobook with a British narrator was never issued I have no idea why!"
3,a basic text,"quite a bit of the research on which it is based is now dated, and some important aspects of nutrition have been completely ignored. It does however give a simple introduction to amino acids, and this is a complex topic, so that it is a good place to start"
2,The Healing Nutrients Within,"When I read the reviews for this book I thought I'd found some great info on healing with amino acids. While there is some useful info in the book, I felt disappointed when I read through it. What got me was the fact that roughly three quarters of the book is a list of references. This is not what I expected. I would never have purchased it had I known.I have to wonder if the older versions of the book had more information. I'm sure not going to waste more money finding out. I'd still like to read a good book on amino acids.(Note: I bought the edition that says, ""New Third Edition,"" on the cover.)"
5,Understanding how important nutrients are for healthy living.,Reading this book has given me a new understanding of health and nutrition and how important it is to eat right! This book is essential for understanding how to stay healthy or get healthy if you are not.
4,THIS DISC KICKS!,"I played 'Serpentine"" as part of my first live performance. This entire release is great! ""Get On Up"" is a stutterin' classic, and the entire disc rocks like they don't do no more!"
3,Leon in a cranky mood,"As I die-hard fan of Donna Leon's Brunetti mysteries -- I went to the trouble of buying this one through amazon.uk since it is not available in the U.S. yet -- I find the author seriously off base here. The plot of the mystery is only moderately interesting or challenging, and Leon herself seems to be in a generally sour mood. The wry and careful observations of Venice tourism and Italian government red-tape have turned into rants and crabbiness that make us wonder if Leon is getting bored with life at the Questura and the Brunetti household. Even the regular cast -- Miss Elettra, Vianello, Patta, Paola, Chiara, Rafi, etc. -- seem to be in a glum place and eager for a fight. For first-time Leon readers some of the earlier books are a better place to start."
2,not using book,"Book is fine, but I'm not going to follow the diet. Will be doing a weight watchers type of diet instead.I lost 7 lbs on the Drinking Man's Diet in a week using the book. Put all back on in 3 wks. Kept wanting to binge."
5,Great Comedy!,"This tape contains two of my favorite Bosom Buddies episodes: The Pilot and Macho Man. The comedic genius and talent of these two actors, as well as the whole ensemble cast, is timeless. I occasionally pull out my old tapes to watch an episode or two and always ending up laughing hysterically. If you want to be in a good mood, watch this show."
1,Crusty Demons X...,"I love dirt bikes. Timing, however, is paramount. I would have enjoyed the video more had I gotten it when it just came out. The content was too dated to get any meaningful review from this consumer."
2,Problem with Sony DSC-F828 - won't work in it,"Beware that Sony's new DSC-F828 camera is _very_ particular about third-party NP-FM50 batteries, and this one DOES NOT WORK in the camera. Works fine in the DSC-F717 and other earlier models, also works in Sony's digital video recorders, but believe me, it will not work in the DSC-F828 digital camera. ..."
2,Experienced User,"Please even with the Sony DSC-F717 this battery didn't last very long. So it may be nice as a quick ""replacement"" DO NOT DEPEND ON IT AS YOUR ""MAIN"" BATTERY, for a photoshoot. For your ""main"" battery...go ahead, bite the bullet, and get the SONY replacement battery."
5,A great book,"As a professional humorous illustrator/cartoonist, I think that the Artist's Market is one of the best books geared toward helping commercial artists find markets for their work. It has listings of greeting card companies, magazines, poster companies, advertising firms, book publishers and galleries. The listings are up-to-date and there is a short description on what the company publishes and how much they pay for purchased artwork. All in all it is a great book and very helpful.[...]"
1,BAIT AND SWITCH!,"I thought I was buying ""Streetwise Pepper spray"". It turned out to be a ""bait and switch"". Rogers Goods sent me a different lesser product than what I had ordered. When I complained to Rogers Goods I was told that's the same thing. I explained I did not want to spray that I wanted Streetwise. Finally after several attempts, Amazon approved my return of the product. I had to pay for the postage which I did not think was right considering I was given the wrong product from Rogers Goods. JMC"
5,A new view of an unfamiliar area of History,"As a history buff, this has been a delightful insight into thebackground and family history of a great wine producing family,now of the famous Napa Valley of California"
5,Terrific!!!,What an incredible story! Any Hollywood producers out there? I think this book could be a blockbuster film. The descriptions of the characters of Angelo and Marianna are so perfectly written that I could envision many of Hollywood's mega-stars in these roles. Kudos to the author!!!
5,Not my usual cup of tea...,"I hadn't expected to like this book as much as I did. A gothic, psychological whodunit that tells you right from the first page what's going to happen, the development is so well done that the story never loses its spell. The way the perspective changes with each chapter is a skillfully executed tour de force that is perhaps the main reason why the book is so gripping: we get to watch the events unfold through the eyes of all involved."
1,RIDICULOUS!!,"I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED! I COMPLETELY THREW MY MONEY AWAY ON THIS ONE. IT ONLY HAS A FEW PAGES, AND DOES NOT TALK ABOUT JUSTIN OR BULL RIDING. IT MADE NO SENSE TO HUSBAND AT ALL. I AGREE WITH HIM. PLEASE, DO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON THIS ONE!!"
4,College Majors Handbook,"This handbook has not yet been updated; however, its principles are stillpertinent. The author urges us to understand and know our abilitiesartistically, intellectually, spatially, in language, ability to lead,numerical, organization skills, science, pursuasiveness and socially.The texts shows sample earnings by knowledge acquired. i.e.high school, college and graduate schoolThe difference in earnings can be significant between high school andgraduate school. i.e. well over $1MM dollars in lifetime earningsMen tend toward business and engineering careers; whereas, women majorin education and the social sciences. Applied mathematicians areemployed by private industry circa 69%; whereas, 9% are self-employed.Physical therapists are employed by the private sector circa 38% and11% are self-employed.This work would be helpful in planning a career over a long termtime horizon. It is worth the price charged for the significant valueof the information contained therein."
5,All You Need for CLEP Principles of Management,"This book contains all that you need to know for the CLEP Principles of Management test. If you study it a little bit, you should easily pass. I scored a 76, which is well above the ACE passing score."
4,"A good TOOL to use, not your primary source to study for CLEP","I purchased this book and studied both this and the CLEP review for the principles of management exam. I passed, but not by a large margin. I think the book is a little outdated but gives a majority of the functions of management and its history. I have an extensive management background and took a small business management class before this exam. Overrall I think it is helpful, but don't rely solely on this book to pass!"
5,helpful,I used this book to clep out of a college management course. I studied this book for two days and passed the test by a large margin. The only part i wish i had studied a little more was management history.
2,Not the best choice,"Information was a bit out-of-date.I purchased two books to help me study for this test, I found the other one much more helpful, so if you are only going to get one book I'd get that one, as it has practice tests and more up-to-date information.:CLEP Principles of Management w/ CD-ROM (REA) - The Best Test Prep for (REA Test Preps)"
4,"Passed, but not with flying colors","I was hesitant to buy this book because of the publishing date. Most of the amazon reviews were from years or months ago, and I was unsure if the material of the book was still relevant to the 2009-2010 Principles of Management exam. I had no previous knowledge management theories or practices. I just needed ro CLEP to fulfill credit requirements for my university. This was the only book I studied for approximately 2 weeks. I used a website that had practice tests, and used those to test myself in addition to the quizzes in the Cliffs Notes book. I did well on the practice tests, but when I took the real exam, I came across several terms that were not covered in this Cliffs Notes book. I passed the exam, but I wish I would've referenced other books to cover all areas of the subject. Overall, I was somewhat satisfied with my selection of this book and I did pass the exam. For my next CLEP exam, I will try an REA study guide."
4,Good reference book for managers,"As a manager, I wanted a book that I can use to quickly review the core subject areas within management. The book was concise and on target. I would receommend it to any manager needing a management quick reference guide."
5,excellent beginning reloader,"This is an excellent entry level reloader, It is even good for the experienced, I have logged hundreds of hours reloading and now have 3 machines set up with different loads for 12 guage. this makes it easy as I can just switch between machines instead of changing the machine each time I want to reload a different type of shell. this is a great product and Mec is the best as far as I can tell in this price range."
1,Do NOT buy from this Amazon SELLER,"Never communicated with me about my order. After waiting two weeks and sending several emails to find out where my order was this seller never sent me any communications. I never recieved the item I ordered. I am also a little ticked with Amazon.com since they never sent me any communication about the claim I filed against this Amazon vendor. I am a little shocked because I have always had great luck with Amazon.com.I hope this was a one time event. My wife and I live in a remote area and we rely on Amazon.com for many of our purchases and I would hate to think that Amazon is starting to be like a lot of the sites that simply don't care about it's customers. My wife even worked for Amazon for a while and was shocked at the lack of attention with this problem.Anyway, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS Amazon Seller."
5,Good advice indeed!,"Where does a shy guy go to answer questions about how to meet other guys? I don't know about you but for this reader ""How to get Laid"" was just the answer. Thank you Mr. Bass for your useful hints and guidelines for those of us who aren't a Greek god amongst our homo brothers. Come to think of it, even you super hotties can probably learn a thing or two from this book. It's funny and frank and always informative. ""How to get Laid"" has helped me understand many things about confidence, personal grooming and even etiquette rules when cruising some where other than just your local gay bar. Love the illustrations too!"
2,Not helpful,"I found most of the advice in this book to be overly obvious and not very useful. Like where to go to meet guys--bars, saunas, gyms, gourmet food stores--duh! Tell me something I haven't already thought of, and tell me some lines that are really funny and not over the top stuff like, ""Where can I find the freshest meat?"" Who in the world really says that? I felt like the author treated the whole business of cruising and meeting guys to be a big joke, not the fine art that it is, and something that we really need to work on. Also, some of the stuff in there was just wrong--like ""foreplay is for girls!"" What??? I don't know what planet this guy is from, but foreplay, anticipation, and attraction are the hottest parts of chemistry that two males can share. If you want real advice on this, I think you're better off looking in the straight aisle, i.e. Double Your Dating by David deAngelo (a downloadable e-book). I've picked up some great tips there and have used them on boys."
5,It is an easy read,It is an easy read not sure that it has helped but it is a good conversation starter when I am out. Enjoyed it.
1,How to have vanilla sex...,"You will learn more from your first gay erotic video than you will from this entire book. The author describes only the most basic practices, and rather badly at that. For example, how to kiss well is ignored entirely, the chapter on oral sex describes the basic mechanics but doesn't describe how to do it well, and something as relatively vanilla and commonplace as anilingus is viewed by the author with horror - he finds himself obligated to tell us that he and his friends don't do it. In short, this is not a person who should be giving sex advice."
5,Complements the dinnerware,I purchased these cups to complement my dinnerware in this pattern. I prefer this smaller size over the mug that came with the set. I love the size and feel of this cup.
3,SoftSpots Bonnie,Sent it back because it made my feet look even bigger. Did not fit well either. The support was comfortable but did not like the look on me.
3,Good for the money!,"The comforter pillow sheets and shams were all cute, as I expected. My daughter loves the bright colors and it really perked up her room. The comforter is surprisingly warm considering the reasonable price. All in all we are happy. A decent buy. Shipping time was really quick and all pieces were received in good condition."
3,Help Please,"I love this set and am amazed at the large number of matching accessories. I can't, however find the most important peice..the comforter! Does anybody know a store online or otherwise that still has this item in stock?"
3,Addictive piece of work,"The whole setting boils down to the root of misunderstanding between 4 families who served the Emperor. The Wu family went through hardships, facing the endless revenge from the other 3 families, and lasted for 100 years. Finally the whole truth comes out at the top of the snowvy mountain, where the treasure buried by the Emperor 100 years ago! What were the secrets? Why was the misunderstanding not resolved before? Who was right? Who was wrong? Who betrayed who? Sworn Brotherhood, loyalty, betrayal, and more. Answers are revealed but the ending will require your deepest imagination and this is the best part of the story. If you are interested in knowing more about Chinese martial arts novel,this Jin Yong novel is a good introduction. Not his best work, I agree but once you finish this one, you will be asking for more! Others to look up for would be The Deer and the Cauldron, published by Oxford University Press."
5,Detailed and full of suspense.,"This is one from the set of 12 novels written by Jin Yong. Too bad not all of them are translated. I know there's another one, The Book and the Sword, translated by Graham Earnshaw..."
1,Doesn't work on Kindle Touch!,"I've been looking for English translations of Jin Yong's works and was surprised to find Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain available for the Kindle. I warn you now, the formatting of this ebook has some serious issues. Every line of text runs beyond the margin so you'll miss a good chunk of what's being said. Also, on my Kindle Touch, many pages appear black, so you can't read anything unless you highlight all the text.I never thought I'd say this for an Amazon purchase, but I want my money back!"
3,Great O&G book for medical students,The textbook I used in medical school at UQ. Just the basics and the essentials. Great for med-school level.I have no interest in O&G; but going into general practice I am satisfied this book covers the basics I need to know to deal with common things in a brief manner.
4,fundamentals of obstetrics and gynaecology,"it shipped really fast... the book is in top shape.the book itself is very concise, and straight to the point.. basically it covers almost all the topics in OB-GYN... it is not that thorough but it is very good for reviews and for clerkship."
5,Fantastic intro and review for O&G,"This book is the perfect introduction for med students into O&G, and also for revision towards exams. Packed with great colour illustrations, and dealing in a systematic manner of physiology, anatomy (better than my anatomy text) and pathology, it is a must-have on any med student bookshelf."
1,disappointed,"This book is recommended by many medical schools in Australia as well as Australian Medical Council. I was disappointed after I started to read it. There are many grammar mistakes and, much worse, the author frequently used complex structure of sentences to describe many different and unrelated things. I wasted lots of time trying to understand the meaning. This really drives me crazy."
2,Words without substance.,"The books gives an easy description of obstetrics and gynaecology, but it does not give much information on the subjects. It is difficult to find answers to even easy questions which arise at the ward during clinics. But you can read the whole book in two days, and that is an advantage before the exam. But if this book is all you read, you might not pass it."
1,Deception,"I have read the recommendations of this book and warn all those who would be deceived; this book does not contain THE TRUTH you seek. For the final authority, read a Bible, there are many translations and ask God to open your eyes to THE TRUTH. God will answer."
1,Very Bad Quality,"This duvet cover was so badly made I am sorry I spent any money on it. First of all it came to me with large white (bleached out) areas on it. Secondly it was advertised as a ""Jersey"" material, this was NOT Jersey! I have jersey sheets that are soft and nice, this was rough and gross. I would never buy this product again. This is the second time I have had a problem with a Wamsutta product. They are very badly made and cheap quality, do not buy!"
5,Its great.,"I got the King size duvet cover and it fit my comforter perfectly. Its pretty heavy, but its soft and warm. I fall asleep in it a lot faster because of the weight."
3,Will probably arrive damaged...,"Now, maybe it was poor judgement on my behalf to buy bulk potato chips online, but I like Pringles. These (pizza flavor) arrived, and I noticed, by ear, some damage, but I didn't think it would be that great, so I opened it up anyway.The first can had minimal breakage, and I thought, alright, this is fine. I just oepened can number two now though, and I see shards of Pringles up to about the halfway point of the can.So yes, lots of these chips were cracked beyond recognition during shipping, which isn't the best way to enjoy a Pringle. Amazon definitely needs to package this item better."
2,Strike 2 for the Saga Series,"Romancing Saga is a mediocre RPG with bad graphics that attempt to be artistic combined with obscure objectives and long boring dialogs.The combat system is pretty standard fare as far as console RPGs go. It is turn based, and starts you out with a good variety of options as far as what commands you can execute in combat. The music, while uninspired, ranges from atrocious to something that sounds like Aerobiz for the Sega Genesis.If you have a friend who will let you play at his house or let you borrow it for a while, and you are a fan of RPGs in general, you may find a little amusement out of this game. Otherwise, I would not recommend wasting your time as there are plenty of better RPGs out there."
2,bad rpg,"I don't like this game chiefly because the music sucks. On top of that, the story is not very dynamic. I hate slow movements and boring conversations. :("
1,Incomplete for GMAT,"I got 750 on the GMAT, proud member of gmatclub community, and a huge fan of Cliffs Series but this one is not a great fit for GMAT.Netagives from GMAT Standpoint- The Grammar/Sentence correction is not really built for GMAT - more of an SAT/GRE/old TOEFL style- There is a section of AWA but that's hardly needed for the GMAT- Very poor RC section- NO Critical Reasoning Section- There is no index - one of the previous reviewers mentioned a ""great index"" but it is not in this edition. There is a detailed table of contents but no index.Positives:- A few good points on usage and grammar such as Like/As or Parallel structure.- Plenty of practice questions but they are again not in the GMAT styleBottom line: there are better books out there for GMAT. Though there are plenty of questions, the strategies and approach in this book make it weak. Lack of CR section ads the last drop."
4,going back to college,This book was helpfull becaouse I am going back to college and it prepares me for their entrence exams.
3,One of the Better Ones,"This review concerns the revised 1959 ed.Since you have probably heared the synopsis one time to many, Ill just summarize it in a nut-shell; On her first case, Nancy is to find the missing will of Josiah Crowley so his freinds and family can claim thier rightful inheiretence. This, like most of the earlier revisions, is fairly good and follows the original plot pretty well, but only shorter and less descrpitive. Reccomended. Grade: B-"
2,"Not for adults. Or the modern, cynical kid","Now I remember why I didn't really get into Nancy Drew books when I was a kid. I seriously don't think Nancy would be able to solve a single mystery if ""clues"" didn't keep dropping directly in her lap. (""Oh, a sudden rainstorm. And what's this? My convertible top won't go up. Well, I guess I'll just drive into this random open barn, which just happens to belong to the people I'm looking for!"") Nancy is sickeningly sweet, smartly dressed, idle rich, and just has loads of time to go investigating mysteries, breaking in to people's houses, arranging lovely surprises and just generally being loved and admired by everyone she meets (except our evil villains, of course, which you can tell are villains because they don't like Nancy). What a Mary Sue. Maybe I'm just too old and cynical to appreciate this series/character."
3,A good Nancy Drew mystery...,"I read both the 1930 and 1959 versions of this book. Both are just as entertaining, only the original version is better written. Unfortunately, the 1930 version also contains some of the worst Black stereo-typing of the series, but otherwise, it's a good book."
1,Disappointing,"I agree with the first reviewer. What a disappointment to see the revised text and a poor presentation to boot. An 80th anniversary edition deserved better.The Applewood Books reprints are closer to what this anniv edition should have been. For those interested in reading the original text, I recommend it.This G&D; reprint is not worthy of adding to my collection."
3,Apparently I bought this twice,When I purchased the second time I was told to look into some folder on the kindle to find this as I had previously purchased. I did and sure it enough it was already on my kindle but I was still charged for it a second time
5,The best book you'll ever read!,This book is fantastic! I loved it. It had action and mystery. Everything I wanted in a book. I just got my first book 1 year ago and ever since than i have read 25 of them. They are so awesome! Nancy Drew is the coolest detective. I love the Nancy Drew series!
3,new face on a classic,"this 80th anniversary edition will appeal to collectors and or a youngster just starting the Nancy Drew series. The cover makes it collectible, as it simply contains the revised text of the first ND title without fanfare or extras."
5,I <3 Nancy Drew,"I decided to start re-reading the series i enjoyed as a child! an easy read, with an inspiring main character! Enjoyed it just as much during the second read!"
3,'Grown up' but fine for young readers,"As a librarian I recommend The Secret of the Old Clock to my students based on how much I enjoyed it 50 years ago. I do wonder at its appeal for today's readers because it is rather archaic! But who could resist cheerful Nancy Drew and her unbounded energy? Even without the reread, I recall the lovely clothes Nancy wore and the car she drove. Although superficial, the story clips along with an array of interesting characters and bright descriptors over a good mystery. As for the ""80th Anniversary Edition""? Give me the old yellow cover with the picture of Nancy kneeling down to pry open the face of the old clock! Nancy is eighteen and drives a car, but will charm tweens who want something more grown up to read. The elegance in the prose is still refreshing. Love that word `sleuth'!"
5,I wish I was Nancy Drew,"Dear Nancy Drew,I know you're not a real girl but you made me want to be a private investigator when I was a little girl. You kept me reading under my blankets long after everyone in my house was asleep. These books are timeless and I enjoyed every single one. I must've read one a week when I was growing up. I used to walk around trying to solve crimes because of these books.Thank you for being so cool.LM"
4,Good Book,"A will leaves out a lot of people that were promised money and Nancy feels there is a newer will that she must find for the sake of all the people involved. She ends up in places where she could get caught and hurt, but keeps working to solve the mystery. I miss Bess Marvin and Geoge Fay, but if it is the 1st you read you will fell like nothing is missing. I hope you read this book.Thanks"
5,Nancy Drew is kool,"You know, i don't like harry potter that much. its not the best thing i have ever read. and i love nancy drew. So watever. i have read nancy drew since 4th grade, and i still think shes kool, and I'm in jr. high now."
1,READ THIS PLEASE !!!!,"I rated this one star even though I haven't read it I just wanted to get your attention. have you read these other peoples reviews the ""1 star""ones ? well they are saying about wanting a nicer covers on the front, I mean pathetic so if they dont have a nice cover ? get over it and dont juge a book by its cover !!!! and if the text is changed good because I'll understand it better than old fashioned stuff !!!! (sorry I'm just so ANGRY!!!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"I always liked the Hardy Boys better than Nancy Drew, which is perhaps not too surprising. The whole team adventure thing there is probably a bit more interesting, and perhaps a bit more freedome given to the young lads than Nancy, anyway.Other than that, a pretty garden variety kids mystery story. With these books, the title does actually have something to do with it."
5,"If you love to kayak, camp and canoe and a little history","What a great book! We spent a week kayaking the Adarondacks and a wonderful day at the Adarondack Museum. In it was the tiny little boat the Sairy Gamp. It sparked my interest to learn of George W Sears travels. Reading Christine Jerome's version of his and her travels was a joy to read. If you love camping, paddling and history you will love how she intertwines modern water travel with the 1800's and G.W. Sears writings.cathy"
4,Effectively evocative,"An Adirondack Passage is a sweet, gentle introspective account of the author's recreation of the voyage of the Sairy Gamp, a boat and journey well known to Adirondack canoeists. Jerome has no bones to pick and her simple yet perceptive descriptions of the people and landscapes she encounters are a fair reflection of the Adirondacks as they really are. Possibly she makes a little too much of the challenge of this route - after all these waters are traversed by hundreds if not thousands every season - but then again, Jerome is admittedly an inexperienced paddler. I've covered these routes multiple times both alone and with my father. An Adirondack Passage transported me back effortlessly to those happy days."
3,Bead Carousel,"This is a decent product but not made of the greatest material...my tower started to crack when just trying to pull the containers out of the holder. Over all I do like this item and its been useful, just wish it was made of slightly stronger materials."
5,Encouraging and Liberating,"A very thorough biography about an amazing individual. Parker would be proud of the term-""heretic"" which literally means ""chooser."" When it comes down to it, we are all heretics since ultimately; we believe what we want to believe. Worth putting your life on back burner and letting this book consume your time. Requires some wading through background info, but overall wheat/chaff ratio is excellent. It is very encouraging to see a liberal non-literal approach to the Bible comes with deep historical roots. Current similar thinkers such as Shelby Spong and Marcus Borg owe Parker a lot. If every religion would admit the large degree of cognitive dissonance necessary to swallow many seemingly self-evident axioms this would be a more peaceful world."
4,Comic noir caper in the Southwest desert.,"Are you a fan of the breezy side of Elmore Leonard or Ross Thomas? Check out this original by newcomer Norman Partridge. Jack Baddalach is a decent fellow and professional boxer, who is asked to hang up his gloves and go to work for the local Vegas don. His first job? Track down a missing $2 million of the Mob's money. Jack's search leads him to a showdown at the Saquaro Riptide motel and its unlikely mix of ex-surfers, retired SEALS, crazy women (both straight and gay) and desert rats. Dark, macho and very, very funny"
4,I adore this camera,"It's fast, small and cool-looking. My husband has a high end digital camera that I like but this one is much faster and also takes good pictures. Digital cameras are improving!Yeah, it does eat battery power, but only if you keep it turned on. I've only had it for a few weeks but have taken it to four gatherings and on a ski trip with no problems except for one time when I let my nephew play with it for a half hour without turning it off. I've already got in the habit of recharging it the evening after I use it so it's ready for next time.I'm only so-so when it comes to understanding how to use high tech stuff, but I was able to figure out the features of this camera pretty easily. Except for the red-eye reduction. It took me a bit of manual study to figure out how to turn it on. (Push the arrow up.)I love the design, too, and so far I love the pictures. And it's just incredibly nice to carry around and pull out and snap pictures with. Makes me giddy."
5,Attention Getter,"Love this camera! Wonderful size. Great pictures. Movie mode was really impressive. Awefully short on battery life when using the LCD Backlight so consider a second battery. I've been wanting to get a digital camera for some time but was completely unable to deal with the lag between pushing the shutter button and getting the picture. I originally bought this camera because it was billed as having no material lag. I can tell you it has lived up to its billing.I took it with me on a business trip and it fit in my suit pocket with less bulk than my Palm. When I took it out to use it everyone wanted to check it out (an added bonus). In fact someone else on the trip liked it so much they bought one as soon as they got back.I am a gadget lover, a shutter bug, and a mobile kind of guy who doesn't have a lot of pockets for carrying stuff. This camera pushes all of my buttons."
4,A great little camera!,"I've been waiting around for a couple of years, trying to convince myself that I really needed a digital camera. I'm glad I finally jumped in with this little gem. This camera makes vacation photography fun again! I was looking for a small camera, but one that would hold up and do some video. I read all the reviews and will admit that I was hesitant, particularly about the memory and battery life. But what I liked out-weighed the negatives, and I am thrilled with my decision. The first thing I did was go out and purchase a larger memory card, which is really necessary. The camera comes with 16 mgs, not nearly enough for photos, let alone video. But with more memory, the thing is perfect for me! I should add that if you really want to enjoy digital photography and don't really want to climb the learning curve, buy a Mac, sit back and have fun!"
4,Aunt Dimity's Christmas,"Its that wonderful time of year that Lori so enjoys. Christmastime is here and Lori has plans to start so many holiday traditions anew that she remembers from her childhood. All of her hardwork and plans are thrown to the wayside when she discovers a mysterious man passed out in the cold and snow of her front yard. Of course mystery surrounds this man. Who is he? Where did he come from? What was he doing in the remote yard of Lori Shepherd?While lying in a coma this man teaches Lori some well needed lessons and he affects so many people. We,of course, meet up with Dimity as she too tries to help figure out the identity of this man. A heartwarming cozy mystery great for Christmastime or anytime reading, Aunt Dimity's Christmas lives up to the past books in the series and keeps me wanting more."
3,The setting is indeed the present,"to a reader from New York---just to clarify, Lori's father did not die during World War II. He died later--from stress and overwork, etc. In the first Aunt Dimity book, Lori comments that it is ironic how her father, a man who survived WWII, could be ""killed by a briefcase and a bad habit."" I like all of the Aunt Dimity books, but my favorite is still the first one. It has a lot of heart, mystery, warmth, and surprises, all of which make for a good read."
3,I couldn't suspend my disbelief that much,"Overall, I enjoyed this book. I liked the question of why the ""tramp"" was carrying WWII medals and visiting WWII airfields. I liked the idea of learning valuable lessons from people you first wanted to ignore.My problem is with Aunt Dimity. I couldn't suspend my disbelief to accept that Lori's dead aunt communicates with her by post-humously writing in a journal."
4,Aunt Dimity,"A delightful, light, airy read. The language is wonderful. The characters a delight. No blood, guts, and gore.... just pure fun and enjoyment."
2,The Setting - is it the 1960s or the 1990s?,"This is the first Aunt Dimity book I have read. It's very nice but the setting confuses me. In the story, Lori, a mother of nine-month old twins, states that her father died in WWII when she was just a few months old. When a comatose man is discovered outside her English cottage, she becomes involved with his past. For help she turns to the Rev. Julian Bright, who oversees a soup kitchen in a shelter for the homeless. One of the first things he says to Lori is ""Don't worry I am not a homosexual."" This is a 1990s phrase so that makes me think the setting is now. She also states that she has a cell phone, another current item. What confuses me is that if this is a contemporary setting, that would make her in her late 50s, and she is the mother of nine month old twins? Maybe she adopted them. The story would be more enjoyable for me if the time setting were clearer."
4,Cozy Mystery for the Holidays,"Lori Shepherd is ecstatic to be able to spend the Christmas holidays with her husband, Bill, and their two, young twin sons, in the cottage that her fabulous Aunt Dimity willed to her. But Lori's holidays are thrown into an upheaval, when she finds the body of a barely alive mysterious stranger lying beneath the cottage's lilac bushes. Lori decides that it's up to her, and her handsome accomplice, Julian Bright, a Roman Catholic priest, to figure out who the stranger is, and solve the mystery involving the man, before Lori's Christmas holidays are ruined.This was my first AUNT DIMITY MYSTERY, and I am not disappointed. Atherton has created a mystery filled with lovable and enjoyable chracters, who will make anyone's spirit bright this Christmas. A must have book for anyone looking for a nice cozy during the Christmas holidays, and Winter season.Erika Sorocco"
2,Initially delightful series now losing its spark,"I really enjoyed the first couple of Aunt Dimity mysteries, but this one left me feeling that the series is starting to wear a little thin: will Lori perpetually end up lusting after handsome strangers and completely forgetting about the existence of her husband Bill? It strikes a big sour note in the books' otherwise cozy/comforting world. And now she's also forgetting about the existence of their two baby sons for chapter after chapter -- and giving away almost all the boys' Christmas gifts at the end of the book, to boot (it's meant to seem charitable, but to me it seemed more like Joan Crawford/Mommie Dearest). For a protagonist who's intended to be sympathetic and appealing, she's beginning to seem pretty annoying and unsympathetic -- and since these mysteries are fun mainly because everyone in them is so nice and unthreatening, this book isn't as enjoyable as the earlier ones in the series."
5,Awesome!,"We gave this to our 16 year old son as a reward for good grades. He loves it! He has discovered Keith Green music, and feels there is none better! When we were young, both my husband and I listened to Keith Green, and went to hear him if he was doing a concert in our area. Keith played with his heart, and his message was always true. His death came very suddenly, but we all new he was still playing in heaven!It is fun to hear our son learning the songs in this book, as well as the silver book as well! He has a few songs he can play from memory (how does he do that?!), and wows people all the time. The music in this book isn't just chords, it is the actual music, with the notes, just as Keith wrote it. The music is not for a beginner, it can be fairly difficult, but worth learning!"
1,Digital Concepts 1000 MAH Replacement Battery for Canon NB-2L/NB-2LH,It did not charge well. Sakar customer service is very average. They said they will send a replacement.
2,Battery Review,"It works, it's beyond cheap compared to official models. It does not last as long as the original battery that came with the camera. I would say about 80% as long. I doubt it actually has the storage capacity the manufacturer claims. But I can buy five of them for the price of one of the Japanese made ones. So for my needs it works. But I suggest you should not believe it will last equal to or longer than the one that comes with the camera originally. Expect 80% the capacity for 10% of the price of the OEM battery. (1500 MAH appears bogus to me but I don't have accurate scientific equipment to verify it)"
3,"Buy the official Canon version, unless you really really can't afford it","I use a Rebel XT and this battery, while 1/3 the price of the Canon NB-2LH, only lasts 1/3 as long. I purchased this thinking I would only use it when the battery that came with my camera was recharging, but I found that in many cases it couldn't even even last through the whole day of shooting on a vacation. I ended up buying a second Canon NB-2LH and now only keep this around as an emergency backup."
1,Total crap,"This battery can't hold any charge.I'm using it for my Canon Rebel XT and this battery can't hold even one shot.As soon as I press on shutter for first time my camera flashing empty battery sign and shuts down.If I'm trying to charge it again, charging completes in few minutes as it is already charged.I'm just throwing it away.Don't waste your money."
4,"Good battery, but be careful when you receive it","The battery is great. Works well with reasonable charge capacity. Both my camera and myself satisfy with it.But the order came in with a wrong one at first. This one is 1500 MAh, but they have another one of 1000MAh. They looks very close except the label of capacity on the paper and on battery label. Guess what, these two models have the same UPC number on their barcodes. Be careful when you receive it. Look on the print first before opening the package.I do hope Amazon inform the manufactor of such error and avoid the wrong shipments in future. This costs Amazon too."
2,Poor Performance,"This 1500mAH performance after full charge is worse than the original Canon Battery, 750mAH."
1,Significantly not as described,Ordered from EforcityBattery was not brand advertised nor 1300MAH cheap knock-off
2,worth the low price.. I guess,"You get what you pay for - it costs about 1/5th the price of the Canon battery, and lasts about 1/5th as long before it has to be recharged."
2,false advertising not 1500 mAh,I bought this battery 2 years ago. It would never show a full charge. I used it as a backup to my canon battery. I finally gave up on it and opened it up. Guess what the batteries are part number icr-14430 3.7v. I checked out the capacity for the number and it is only a 650 mAh battery. They are in series to get 7.4v but the amperage is still only 650. Don't buy them thinking you are getting a longer life. It never even lasted as long as my OEM and it is still working fine.
1,Wasted money.,"I purchased this as an additional battery backup for my Canon G9. After fully charging it, it will not work AT ALL in my Camera.I didn't notice the problem til it was too late to get my money back. Manufacturer says they will replace it, but I highly doubt another will be any better. I noticed the 3 contacts were more recessed than the Canon battery and wonder if that is the problem (in other words, it may not be making contactt. Sakar, the manufacturer, didn't seem interested in my observation. I'm back to buying a Canon battery."
1,Not Good (was okay for a month),"Hello folks,I guess most of the good reviews are written with in a month of purchase.This battery was okay (Not good) for few initial charges . Now when I put it for charging, the charge complte light will come on in 5 minutes. Then i could take few pics. My original canon battery (5 yrs)hold more charge than this one. I could not locate the warranty form in the original packagng. Tried their website and the only thing I found was a pdf to send the produt back to them (No RMA etc).I do not under stand how they rate the battery to 1500mah(may be just sticker).Bottom line : IMO do not BUY this product."
4,Very Happy,"I purchased this about 2 months ago and so far have been very happy. It definitely last longer (significantly) than the original Canon battery and has given absolutely no trouble so far. It charges in the Canon charger that came with my G7. On a trip I just completed to Rome the camera was in constant use, with the :CD screen on. I also reviewed many photos on the screen in the evening. The camera lasted for days without a charge or any indication that the battery was in need of charging. Overall, very good."
4,Excellent!!!,I have used this battery for the past 4 months on my Canon RebelXT and it works great. The battery last as long as the Canon NB-2LH battery that came with the camera. I highly recommend this battery.
3,False advertising on warranty,"I just bought the battery, works fine, but want to say that ""5 year limited warranty"" is a lie. If you look up the warranty on the web site, it simply is a ""one year warranty."""
2,No as good as advertised,"I bought the battery from Amazon one year ago, and the battery already dead."
1,Digital Concepts/Sakar Canon NB2L replacement battery,"This is the worst battery I have ever purchased. After fully charging this battery the Powershot S50 shows that I need to recharge battery. I had to contact Sakar (distributor) numerous times via e-mail and phone. Finally a rep was reached and advised I must pay $5.00 for handling and shipping. I received a new battery. Same thing. It could not hold a charge. The first battery from Sakar cannot even power up the camera. I can take four shots with the second battery. I have tried charging with my original Canon charger. Still no good.The Digital Concepts charger is crap. The DC charger does not even fit into the car lighter. I always thought Sakar products were cheap and inferior. They are not even that. They are just crap. Never, ever purchase their products. Buy the original equipment batteries or separate adjunct batteries."
1,Do not buy this...stick with the Canon product,"I bought this battery to save money. It doesn't hold a charge, not at all. The charger keeps blinking red and green. Had to return it. Don't waste your time thinking you are saving money with this one."
1,Works not fine,"It can not hold a charge, After fully charging this battery the Powershot S70 shows that I need to recharge battery.I figured I'd save money and purchase this battery instead of one of Canon's for my S70 camera. Just blinks red and green. Not worth it at all."
2,Not 1500Mah!,Was sent a 1300 Mah battery. Complained to Amazon but they said that since they aren't doing business with that company anymore they can only offer a full refund if I send it back. Decided it wasn't worth the effort to get the refund.
3,An interesting if not scholarly account of a troubled town.,"Strife in the Sanctuary is an interesting read, but doesn't fully explain what it sets out to explore: Why would a small religious community expel some of its members for getting too religious? This fascinating question is raised, but the author does not employ journalistic or scholarly methods or reasoning to find answers and relies a bit too much on gossip and his own opinions and beliefs to make his point. I enjoyed the book, I just wish the research was more thorough."
2,Doesn't make much noise,"Really, these spoons make a faint tapping sound. I could make more percussive noise just snapping my fingers. Better to use two spoons, the old-fashioned way."
2,not balanced correctly,Don't bother if you wants these spoons to actually play music. They aren't balanced correctly and don't make the right sound.
3,does the job,"These spoons are a little light and ""chinsey"" but it does the job. I can play a few rhythms on the hitting my hand and then against my leg for another sound. I am sure there is better quality out there somewhere."
3,Not as fun as I had hoped.,"Not sure what I expected but the sound is not as pleasing as I had hoped....and I was hoping my kids would have fun with them but they're too hard to use for my 4 year old. Bet they are better for older kids. They're fine, just not a favorite."
3,CONTACTING SUPPLIER IS DIFFICULT,"Didn't receive product on time, called supplier and they informed me, after their investigation, that UPS delivered my package to wrong address. It was finally delivered to me a few days later. This company is extremely difficult to contact my email, you have to call them if you have complaints or issues with your package(s). I received a 20% discount for all the inconvenience."
5,Buy this filter!,"As far as the quality of this filter I see no difference in quality between the new and the old. These filters are the best on the market as far as im concerned. They give you extra large filter cartridges, extra large media container and the biowheel which is the best as far as biological filtration. They are also durable and dependable. The flow control as far as I can see they did take that part away but i never used it anyway. I have mine in my bedroom and i love the sound of the trickling water. These filters are not what i would call noisy."
5,Emperor 400 Power Filter,"I have had this aquarium filter in a 44 gal tank running 24/7(except when I feed the fish for 5 minutes) for the last 14 years. This is a very robust power filter since we have electricity surges due to summer storms, and the Emperor filter is unaffected, even when a near lightening strike wiped out a TV & PC about 5 years ago. I do wish they had put an on/off switch on the cord, so I wouldn't have to unplug it while feeding the fish. I will be replacing the impeller since it has been getting noisier for the last 5 months."
4,Strings,"Yo. This ain't too bad. It's like a Jonathan Richman album. It makes you like music again. But it's the strings man...awesome. The lyrics are a little wack, but hey, that's cool...this album is mad sweet...mad catchy. A good buy."
4,this joint is great!,I bought this CD for a frined and we listend to it and it is AWESOME. It is the best thing from Adam Green that I have heard yet. Putting more bass and drums and even violins in his recordings gives his music a much fuller sounds. Go Adam!
4,Did Anyone Else Notice Roads Must Roll Sounded Familiar,"Unless I'm crazy, the theme in ""Roads Must Roll"" is very similar to the intro title from Legend of Zelda: Link's Adventure for the Nintendo.I can dig it!I highly recommend this CD."
3,Boom Bip. Boom Bleep Blip.,"One of the luxuries of being a DJ is having complete creative control over your art, and Boom Bip, aka, Bryan Hollon, demonstrates this quite nicely with his spacey quirky brand of turntabilism. 'Seed To Sun' takes the DJ Shadow template, shifting back and forth between the post-rock of Tortoise and the IDM of a Boards Of Canada. Dotted throughout are interesting twists, eg, Kid Koala-type scratches, kitschy samples, and the ambient vibes of early Aphex Twin/Tangerine Dream. Although not lost in this minimalist mish-mash is the CD's warmth, trancelike yet charming at the sametime."
2,Just Okay,"This product is okay, must use with care...The product will leak if it is overturned (does not travel well)."
2,Terrible mixer,"Company shipped fast, and the price was good. Love the portage in the bottom cup, and the ice wand is a nice touch - I hate warm protein drinks. Unfortunately, the ""fan"" mixer thing works about as well as a Labrador in the desert. I ended up with clumpy ""pebbles"" of mix.J"
4,A must for any history lover,"Published by National Geographic, this is a history book that takes many taken-for-granted events (such as Columbus and Pearl Harbor) and completely re-tells the event using recently discovered or little known evidence. Set up in the form of question and answer, it takes about twenty points in history and re-examinens them, leaving you astounded and wondering how much about history you really do know.I enjoyed this book a lot, especially since history interests me, although I wouldn't give it five stars. Some of the events examined, such as Stonehenge and the pyramids, didn't provide that much new information but seemed simply to end up confirming knowledge that many people already know or would with basic research. But other points in history, such as the death of Napolean or the possibility of the Chinese discovering America, was completely new and extremely interesting. Maybe not worth buying new but definitely used."
5,Very Informative!,"The kids and the adults like this book. It's always laying around somewhere in the house, never on the book shelf."
1,Rigged review?,"This book is just too outdated to be of any practical use, but that's not the point of this review.The funny thing i want to point out is about all the other reviewers who gave this book a 5-star rating.Of course, i believe a few of them really think this is a good title; but the majority of them are just fake users to push the rating up. You think im kidding? just click on the ""see all reviews from this reviewer"" button for each of those reviewers, and you'll see that for most of them, his/her ratings for all books are 5-star. I can hardly believe this fact. The only reasonably conclusion is that these are fake readers created by some charlatans to boost the ratings of some select titles."
2,These aren't the real alternatives,"Instead of writing about the real alternatives to prisonsuch as less punative criminal justice policies that work to mend damaged communities instead of tear them further apart, Anderson's book uncritically describes programs that expand the state's power further, will saving no one from prison. Alternatives to Prison does a disservice to the subject it proports to examine. -Daniel Burton-Rose, co-editor, The Celling of America: An Inside Look at the U.S. Prison Industry."
5,Love this stuff,"I'm incredibly sensitive to cleaners. I have finally found something that I can use consistently without any irritation to me. Not only that, it does the job 100%. Really, it's been a lifesaver and I'm always telling people about it. I should own stock. ;)"
3,Disappointing on Mac but ScanTango saves it,"I expected TravelScan 464 to be a suitable replacement for the Visioneer Strobe portable scanner, once they stopped supporting the Macintosh platform. Unfortunately, the TravelScan's own software is next to useless on a Mac. The company's support group never answer phone calls or e-mail. Thankfully ScanTango (http://www.scantango.com/downloads.html) have come out with software for this scanner. That software also supports Visioneer Strobe XP 100. Take your pick."
3,Faster than a speeding building!,"Able to leap tall bullets with a single bound. But seriously, it is a small enough scanner, but the software interface is weak. I've had two other scanners, a Logitech PageScan Color Pro and A Visioneer Paperport Strobe, with eithe of the two you could feed one page after another without having to mouse click 3 times like you have to with this scanner. Both of those were connected via the Parallel printer port, and we couldn't get the Strobe Scanner to work with the Newer PaperPort software and my new Laptop only has USB ports. If anyone out there knows of a better scanner or perhaps some software that works better and faster than what comes with the scanner, please post. It sure seems like these newer scanners have taken a Giant leap backwards in the way they let you scan multiple pages, but maybe it is the nature of the USB port. I have to find a different scanner!"
5,Carry this with you,"This book was an essential introduction to literary criticism for me as I went from under- to post-grad studies. Lundin displays the development of postmodernity in a precise, insightful way that proves a solid foundation for further thought."
5,FANTASTIC! One of his best to date!,"I have been listening to Marty Brown for almost a decade and he just keeps getting stronger as far as his writing ability goes. Although his first three were great, ""Here's to the Honky Tonks"" has several that are radio-worthy! Hey, if anyone has any info on actual play dates for Marty, they would be greatly appreciated!"
3,This CD is an OK CD compared to his other ones.,"I do like this CD, but my personal opinion is that his first CD, High & Dry, was the best. But I do like about 2 or 3 songs on this CD and I rate is because its not bad, yet its not the best either."
3,get fried,"i never really cared too much for The Kills' blend of dirty stripped down blues rock, but maybe because i wasn't listening close enough...because this little single is pretty great. i love the song ""Fried My Little Brains"" with it's bare drum sound and gritty guitar. and the whiskey-soaked vocals are smooth and seductive. the remaining two tracks are suitable b-sides, but you'll be coming back to the first song again and again. pretty cool."
5,A beautiful CD of country music sung with soul.,"Buddy Miller is one of those artists who will never be popular with radio for whatever reason. Yet, his songs are covered by other artists who will get airtime with them. This CD teams Buddy with his wife Julie, Lucinda Williams, Dan Penn and others.Once you listen to it, you will play it again and again. Very similar to albums by Dan Penn, Donnie Fritts, Eddie Hinton, and Arthur Alexander. Essential!!"
5,Great stuff,I once shook hands with this man! I saw him with his wife (and a guitar) supporting the great Steve Earle in England and they blew us away. This CD is brilliant. Get also his next two. A great songwriter...
3,Toothless drama,"Despite excellent photography and acting, Imagine Me & You fails to be interesting. The main drama -- a married woman in love with another woman -- is confined to the relationship between the lovers. The tension between the female leads is compelling at first but loses energy as it drags on without anything to replace it. The expectation of an enormous explosion for this forbidden relationship fizzles after several scenes where everyone, including the jilted husband, is instantly supportive. The movie is billed as a comedy but would better be categorized as a drama -- and a toothless one at that."
1,uuuggghhhhh,this movie was awful. i am usually a sap for cute lesbian movies but this was a waste of time. the only reason i watched the whole thing was because i thought it would get better. no one says they want to dance and then goes to an arcade to play ddr. i feel like i should have been paid to watch this rather than paying my own money for it.
4,very enjoyable and definately catchy tunes,"wow - didn't expect to like this one as much. Piper Perabo and girl meets girl with no tragedy, the guy gets dumped and survives to find better things, happiness and love. Check it out its a cute flick. The steamy scenes could have been a bit more, but all in all cute flick"
3,Imagination lacking!,"Nothing spectacular; very predictable, and probably better off spending time watching a Disney movie! I would waste money buying or time watching."
3,Region problem,i live in australia and have bought many region 1 Dvd before and they have all worked on my region free dvd player but this dvd didnt work.
2,Best thing about this film is Matthew Goode,"I loved ""kissing jessica stein"" and so i figured i'd give this a go. Well, no! Piper Perabo just isn't a good actress. I mean she tries and you can tell, but she just stinks! She pouts the entire way through the film and is put in obsurd situations, the only time she doesn't pout to convey the point 'she's truly found herself' is at the very end! Save your money and time and rent ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" or ""Lost and Delirious"" which she did when she was 12 and was to young for us to see how rubbish she really is!"
3,An okay movie,"This was an okay movie. The story line was pretty good. Piper is a talented actress, and Lena is amazing. It is a PG movie though, so if you're looking for sexy girl on girl action this is not the movie. Kinda disappointing in that aspect."
5,Absolutely wonderful,This is by far one of my all time favorite movies. It makes you feel good about love regardless of orientation. Lena Headey is amazing.
5,NO other movie for me,This movie is completely satisfying. I rented it on a whim one day and just fell in love with it. It is definitely pleasing to watch when you are a girl who is upset with the opposite sex. I already suggest it to all my girl friends.
4,Great Movie,"Piper Perabo pulled off the English Accent very well! I also liked how this movie isn't just a ""lesbian"" movie. It's about the power of love and it doesn't care/matter what the gender is. You feel what you feel, and that's it! Definitely recommend this!"
4,Very good movie,I liked the cast and the movie very much. I was in the same situation once so it seemed real to me.
5,Better Than Chocolate....,"Delightful love-story with a twist. Intense chemistry between characters Luce and Rachel. Unlike many stories of this genre, the character who plays Rachel's husband, Heck, is quite sweet and adorable as well. Unique storyline. The sexual tension between Rachel and Luce is palpable. Rachel's deep feelings for her adorable Heck, make pulling for her to follow her heart, not a simple decision. The viewer feels torn...but the honest yearning between the two women is tender and heart-warming. Their deep connection is undeniable.Several light moments throughout the movie. Even the parents of the characters are endearing. I highly recommend this flick! I typically hate British films....but this one is a keeper!"
4,Imagine You and Me,"A delightful romantic comedy about meeting the ""unstoppable force"" of soul-mate love. Piper Perabo and Lena Headey are wonderful together."
2,I'm disappointed...,"Decided to watch this movie last night after seeing almost perfect ratings from other users. I'm a little disappointed. I didn't like the movie, not because it is a lesbian movie. If you call falling in love with someone else (love at first site) on your own wedding day is romantic, then this is the movie you should watch. Sometimes you have to use some common sense to reason, and not just follow your heart. This is why divorce rate is increasing ever rapidly!"
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen!,"The reviews sold me on watching this movie and from now on I will not depend on the number ofstar ratings again. I am not gay and the ""reviews stated"" that it was a great movie, even if you were not gay...and that it was a great love story worth watching. I found myself still cheering for the husband and wife to reunite and it did not have a ""happy ending for everyone"" as the reviews stated. To leave the husband crying on his roof top, is not a happy ending in my opinion. I just wasn't ""into"" this movie. What a waste of $ 2.99. I will stick with the traditional love stories."
1,What the ?,"I cannot go by other people reviews anymore! This movie has a lot of good reviews and then I saw it. I did NOT like it at all, I actually can't believe I wasted my precious time on this horrible movie. (sorry people, for those that loved it..i guess we all have different taste!)"
5,Imagine Me and You,"Piper Perabo is unbelievable in this film, you'd never know she wasn't British, her accent is perfect. I haven't seen a film that illustrates the complexities of love at first sight so well ,or the consequences of following it out. It was clear the characters had no choice but to be together or to be unhappy living a life of mediocrity in terms of the heart."
4,Imagine Me and You,Very cute movie. I liked it alot. Needs to be watched with an open mind. Just goes to prove the saying that we can't help who we fall in love with. I loved the husband's line about the unstoppable force - very clever!
3,"""Simon"" at last!","An imaginative and well-acted little gem from 1980. I'd almost given up hope of ever finding this on DVD. Alan Arkin is priceless in the title role; the shots at American society/culture from the late 70's are sublime. HOWEVER, the disc has NO extras. Since when is closed captioning an extra? Newsflash to the manufacturers of this disc: Closed captioning is essential not just because there is an aging population who cannot hear as well as in earlier years, but also because sound gets muddled sometimes , or dialog is underspoken. Pity, the transfer to disc is clean and precise but leaving out the CC is a two star error. Get a clue, WB!"
5,sway bar,all parts appear to be of good quality and function well - and at great savings over similar american made product $50 vs $250 - i believe in buying american but i dont believe in throwing money away
1,Self tapping bolts pulled out,Easy to install but on the 4th day the self tapping bolts came out-stripped out of the frame. It was adjusted as recommended and I never backed up or turned too tightly. I felt it helped and will likely pay to have it welded in place. Lost one pin and 4three bolts. I would probably buy a Reese equalizer hitch with anti-sway next time but I have an Eaz type.
5,Great buy,Bought this for much less than anywhere else. It works great. I use it for a 28ft trailer and don't get any sway.
1,Piece of Junk!,This item was installed and the ball torqued as per manufacturer's specifications: with the factory tension on the slide bar the front ball broke during a normal turn onto the street. Consequently the front of the bar fell onto the ground and dug in which could have been catastrophic had the vehicle been at speed. An absolute piece of junk and I'm surprised Amazon sells such rubbish. Buy at your own risk - caveat emptor!
2,Measure before buying; Amazon SUCKS for returns / refunds,"Purchased the Camco weight distribution hitch and it was recommended to purchase the sway bar; unfortunately, it is difficult to fit both on a 6 X 10 foot trailer. Also the hieght of the trailer frame was smaller than the base plate holes so it would not have fitted anyway. Amazon SUCKS in that although the parts made by the same manufacturer did not work together as advertised, Amazon did not care and when I returned it I only got 50% of my money back. I now LOOK ELSEWHERE instead of Amazon since I now know several trailer company websites offer a FULL REFUND if parts don't work together when they are supposed to."
2,friction pads,"This unit worked really great until it was about 4 years old. From being parked outside and road salts etc. the friction pads came loose and there's no way to repair them, therefore rendering the unit useless. I would think they would use some other way to fasten them instead of a dab of glue that lets loose when the unit gets rusty."
3,Yum....,"I bought this for my uncle who is diabetic and in his area he couldn't find a medium cut marmalade. He loved it but it did cause his blood sugar to spike as the dextrose will still do that. He was fully aware that this would happen and cared for his sugar levels accordingly. Only downfall is that dextrose will send a person to the potty. Again..when you are aware of your sugars and what you can and cannot have, you learn to enjoy what you can and manage the results appropriately. Shipping was quicker than I ever expected...Thank you so much for a great product! My uncle was very pleased with the marmalade."
5,Easy to Read - Easy to Understand-Easy to Use,"PeopleSmarts presents the basic principles of good communication skills in bite size pieces. In its easy to read style, PeopleSmarts allows the reader to digest the principles one at a time and not become overwhelmed by the size of the task. By providing easy to understand examples and suggestions for individual practice, the book is not only enlightening by practical as well. It is a book that is useful for the individual and the professional equally"
5,Communicate effectively and understand people better,Provides an excellent step by step approach to working with people. Exercise at the end of each chapter reinforces the concept and is very practical. I would suggest this book to any one who wants to express themselves well and understand why people sometimes behave strangely.
2,a how-to book with step by instructions and exercises,"I did not finish the book - it is more like a 'workbook' than a book. I was hoping to get some insight into how to deal with people in the workplace - this book is full of material that I consider to be common sense. Little emperical or formal evidence is offered.I suggest 'The Secret Handshake' by Kathleen Kelley Reardon for readers interested in improving their polical skills in a business setting.That's my take - loopster - Chicago, IL"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought these a size too big and they still barely fit, then a seam split when I had been wearing them for 15 minutes. Complete waste of money."
2,Lee Jeans low quality material.,Lee Jeans has always been my favorite jeans and I would buy nothing but Lee's. But as with everything it is about cutting cost and by doing so it has made a bad judgement call. Lee Jeans has changed it's material to a lesser quality jean fabric resulting in the material just suddenly spilting open or just fraying on the seams. In the last 4 months I have gone thru 3 pairs of jeans. They did away with the french seam on the inside of the leg wrong choicethat is the one area on women that wears out first. The french seams makes for a stronger and longer lasting seam. But because the material is so thin any real stress and the material splits in a way that cannot be repaired other than an iron on patch.Needless to say that they have lost me as a customer and will now go back to wranglers. I live in my jeans and it is important that they hold up. Farewell Lee Jeans it has been great up unitl now.Lee Women's Relaxed Fit Jean
5,Love the fit!,So happy to find these to order. Bought one pair several months ago and noticed last night that there is a tear by the back pocket - then I read these reviews and found that another has had the same issue! But they are a perfect fit so I'll buy more. Interesting that that is a stress point for these jeans. Doesn't matter. I'll keep buying them because of the fit! Love the 'at the waist' fit!
2,jeans,"I bought two pairs of stretch jeans, exact same style and size. One pair is definitely stretch and fits tighter than the other pair. I am not sure why both pairs are not the same since I ordered the same pairs of jeans. Perhaps the tags were wrong. At any rate, both pair fit, but I have to wear a belt because they gap in the back. That's the only draw back. They wash up well and do not shrink."
2,Improper stitching,"I hadn't worn these jeans until just last week but when I put them on, the stitching in the right pocket was messed up. I figured it was too late to return these for another pair where it wasn't messed up so I have washed them. If I am still able to return them for an exchange, please advise."
1,Great fit but lower-quality material,"These jeans have a comfortable fit for curvier bodies. The waist is high (higher than my preference) but tolerable. By far their biggest problem is that the jeans material is thin and easily tears. Both of my pair lasted only about 2 1/2 months, because they tore at the back pocket. I don't expect strength-of-steel but I do expect jeans to last longer than this. I am shopping again, but not for Lee brand jeans."
2,Not for me,"Even though the company tried to describe the fit of these jeans, they fell short of the mark. The jeans didn't even come close to fitting me. Not only were they too big, the shape was totally different from what I thought from the decription. I am short 4' 10"", but not a plus size. I did not understand they were for a plus size woman."
2,Not inspirational -- just dull,"I suspect that Betsy Carter thought her autobiography would be inspirational. It's not. She often comes across as self-centered and immature. Also, her anecdotes and descriptions are not really very exciting. There's lots of mundane stuff here -- her mother's dress styles, her childhood friends, her dates with prospective suiters, etc. These details might be vaguely interesting to people who know the author personally. I found them to be boring.Overall, I don't recommend this book."
2,Happy martyr,"While her resume sparkles, Betsy Carter does not live up to the promise of her editorial credits. The facts of her story are certainly interesting, but Carter's observations of her own fate are removed and somewhat clinical, rather than compelling and empathetic. Her story weaves back and forth between her childhood, young adulthood and careerhood in a poorly structured manner that is confusing to the reader and does the story no favors. My hopes were so high for this book and I was sorely disappointed. Readers are tired of the ""woman overcoming adversity story."" This one could have stood out with more emotion and less antisepticism."
3,The French Revolution Paper Dolls,"The illustrations in this book are terrific, and beautifully colored, and the biographical text is an interesting overview of the personalities and the era.However, as a paper doll collector I was disappointed with the format. Most of the dolls do not have additional costumes and those that do, have only one extra costume each. The greatest disappointment of all was the Marie Antoinette doll (which doesn't resemble the queen), and her costumes (they look like dresses one would see on the ugly sisters in a Cinderella pantomime). It's a pity her costumes weren't based on actual gowns she wore in portraits."
5,great...but....?,"This is truely a great collection of die-hard Procol fans. What I want to know is what ever happened to all the cuts from the ""Broken Barrickades"" album, like ""Simple Sister"" and "" Power Failure"", etc. I can't find them anyplace. If anybody out there has any info, please e-mail me... signed True Procol Fan Vaugj@aol.com"
3,live w/ Edmonton symph orch??????,"It's good BUT...How can the album procol Harum did with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra live have been overlooked when CD's were being produced?It's some of the finest, blood rushing music ever."
3,there are better ones out there!,"The sound quality on this disc was very poor. It sounded like what it is - a bootleg. It's a shame since the song selection is killer! Check out ""Live At The BBC"", ""Live In Europe"" or best of all ""Irish Tour"" to hear MUCH better live recordings. I felt it was a waste of $15.00."
3,Great Performance But....,"This is a great performance by Rory, and I'm glad I got to hear it. However, those of you expecting it to sound as good as a typical commercial live album are going to be disappointed. While I have no problem with his record company releasing an audience recording (I have the original G-Men box set), they should have put some effort into fixing the glaring balance problems which occur during the final two songs. In particular, the really strong performance of ""Messing With The Kid"" is nearly ruined by the sound ping-ponging from the left channel to the right and back again. If they're going to put this out as one of Rory's official releases, they need to do some quality control before it hits the shelves."
1,Phyto no!,My hair didn't feel good. It wasn't soft it was greasy and it felt with built-up. IT WAS NOT MANAGEABLE! Not worth it.
3,not that great,"Although it did not leave a greasy feeling on my hair, it did not make my hair as soft as promised. For the price, I expected more."
1,this stuff sucks,"I was anxious to try this product out after reading all the positive reviews. However, I found this nourishing cream to be anything but nourishing...or ""creamy"". In fact, it's consistency was too light to be an effective moisturizer and it actually dried my hair out and made it brittle. I would absolutely not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Ultra Dry Hair,This product claims to moisturize ultra dry hair. Well I guess it doesn't know what ultra means because it had absolutely no positive effect on my hair which is type 4. It doesn't have a nice fragrance either. I won't recommend this for extremely dry african american hair.
5,Swing... Bridging The Generation Gap,"Track Listing:1. [7:38] Sing, Sing Sing2. [3:05] Song of India3. [3:10] Down South Camp, Meeting4. [4:53] Anvil Chorus5. [2:10] Sourth Rampart Steet Parade6.

5,A jewel of a documentary,This is a jewel of a documentary. It takes you behind the scenes into the world of today's young female Russian tennis stars who are dominating the women's tennis tour in the wake of Anna Kournikova's rise to celebrity stardom. It has amazing footage of the players as children; candid interviews (don't miss Anna's interview) and includes an angle on the history of tennis in Russia. This is a must-see for all sports fans. It is beautifully produced and is hard to take your eyes off.
4,"A unique book, a good one","Whatever might be said in finding fault with this book as a literary work, I've had it around for almost thirty years and have enjoyed reading it several times. The fact Golem was a monster, the fact the Jewish community is portrayed as what it probably was, the fact that every element of this story is a tragedy, none of that takes anything away from it for me.I keep this one on the science fiction shelf of my mind, even though it's more than that, different from most science fiction. It's historical fiction, it's fantasy, and in a sense it's a study in eastern European and Jewish cultural history.I have no qualms about recommending it despite what others might see as literary flaws. I've dissected enough good books in university English departments to understand how perfect a work must be to survive the determined perusal by lesser men."
5,Sound Track of What the Bleep Do We Know?,"I love the music in the movie so I decided to also get the sound track. It has songs from the easy listening to the pop rock genre. It's very relaxing, groovy and at the same time, sends good messages."
1,Boring - don't waste your time or $$,"This DVD is a waste of time and money. Not very exciting, sexy or interesting. A big dissapointment!!!"
4,Love the Shorts,Some of the shorts in this package were great. We just love to watch these types of DVD's.
5,WORTHY FOLLOW UP TO MUSH,"This is the follow up album to Mush, one of the all time great punk albums. Imagine Motorhead and Husker Du making babies and you might be close to the sound of Leatherface. Catchy as hell, every song is a winner. The only way it pales next to Mush is in the vocals. On Mush, Frankie's vocals were harsh yet melodic; here, in the space of a year, due to touring, age, or who knows what,he barely rises above a garbled whisper. Don't let that deter you,however; if you are tired of Sesame Street punk and want an old school lesson, you can't go wrong with Minx."
1,Terrible,"The lesbians have absolutely no chemistry (although to be fair, despite the title, the movie is about middle daughter Elvira and her impending twentysomething crisis). The actions of the daughters in trying to break them up are actually quite vile, when you think about it, but are sugared with a Almodomar-esque brightness and sweetness. Conventional Hollywood ending. Just goes to show that, because of the slim offerings for lesbians in the cinema, sapphic moviegoers will praise movies that are actually somewhat insulting to them."
1,Not Spanish Speaking,"Had I known the movie was in Spanish with English subtitles, I would never have purchased this movie. I did not see any where this was how the movie was set up until after I opened it and in small print on the DVD is where it was. A total waste of money."
4,what a mind boggling book,"new author Kristal Bagley writes her short stories with passion. The stuff she wrote about in her book makes you think when you finish reading it. my fav, was the story entitled ""Hope"" You all have to read it. those of you who are not into long books that takes too long to get to the point this writer is for you."
2,"Good reference, but not a modern text","If you want a good grammar reference, this is the book. However, the text is old. There are several vocabulary items that reveal the original age in which the course was written (1882). For example, in the travel chapter, it has the Spanish word el vapor, steamship. Hey, we don't even call them by that term in English!Also, the pronunciation guide is for the Madrid dialect only, with no variation for Latin America. Sr. Cortina had a good idea in 1882, but the methods and language have changed over the last 120 years. Perhaps the publishers should consider either updating the material or taking this one out of print.By the way, I am a Spanish teacher who was looking for a simple conversational book for adults with little or no background. Needless to say, I had to do a lot to supplement this text."
2,mediocre,"this book is a good resource in despite of my rating. however, it is a good resource only for someone with previous knowledge of spanish. the final chapters are literature excerpts, but contain no translation which i would find frustrating if i were a novice."
3,SSL,I am an English speaker attempting to learn Spanish as a second language. The textbook is well organized. The memorizing is up to me!
4,Great for an oscar cichlid,I ordered this 6 months ago and I am satisfied with it. It is easy to install and maintain. My only problem with it is its output...I have it filtering a 55g freshwater tank with one 6in Oscar Cichlid. After a few weeks of use it's water output decreased...even after I cleaned out the unit and pipes. Even with the low water return it still is doing its job. I use the polishing filter insert and I am amazed at what it collects. The bio wheels are working wonderfully. The carbon insert for the filter broke after a few weeks...but I dont need to use it for an Oscar anyways (it purifies too much...even the good bacteria..leaving an Oscar open for things like Hole-in-Head). It primes easily as long as the canister is filled with water. If you are hesitant on purchasing this I say buy it...it will do the job.
5,freshwater fish watcher,I highly reccommend this product you can't beat it for the price.It is a little tricky to set up however it is worth the effort.I have it installed on a 30 gallon tank. you need to get the pro filter because of the bio-wheels. Necesary for biological filtration. I have had the filter for over a year. I change the chargoal every 2 months. the foam sleeve will last through several cleanings if rensed properly. I have read negative reviews sounds like the directions were not followed. Be shure and follow the directions. You should have no problem.
2,Magnum 350,"I still have not gotten it to work. The motor works, but I can't get suction into the inlet tube. The basket that holds the carbon media is very poorly designed; it opens easily, spilling the charcoal out into the canister (where it doesn't belong). I did solve that by using 2 rubber bands to hold it in place. There is also a ""rigid core"" that fits inside the basket; my wife accidently threw it out after the basket opened when she had to clean it (I can see how it would happen). I reordered a replacement, and it was several WEEKS before it shipped. Overall, I have not had a very good experience with this filter, although if I could get the $@#% thing to work, I might form a different opinion."
5,wow,although a little complecated to install the results are well worth the investment of time and money.
3,Could have been better,While I recognize that the author has an unparalleled authority to write about the SR-71 he is a total amateur when it comes to writing a book.The content is fascinating. The stories are amazing... I just wish he had collaborated with authors like Dennis Jenkins or Tony Landis.Still. If you are an SR-71 buff then this is an invaluable insight into it's world.P.S. I am a complete XB-70 nut... This book just made me realize how special the XB-70 was... You could fly at Mach 3+ in your shirtsleeves and not have to stop every five minutes to fill up with gas!
4,Great info for a plane junkie,I love this book. It gives all kinds of details! Love it!! Love the short stories from other pilots that are placed throughout the book.
2,Not much new here,Pretty much an ego boost for the author. Some decent photos and details of this incredible airplane.Would have liked more about the plane and less about him.
3,Blackbird,"Nice book, written to learn a bit more about the Blackbird. A times a bit slow. But overall nice to read"
2,SR-71 Politics Revealed,"This author had an agenda, and he doesn't hide it. It seems he wrote the whole book just to fill for the later chapters where he puts forward his agenda and whines on how the program was unfairly terminated and how they didn't deserve to have their little toy taken from them.The book has virtually nothing in terms of technical or developmental aspects on the plane and fills an entire chapter with detail such as how to operate the engine's doors which is quite irrelevant since that's pretty much the ONLY technical aspect we get to see in the book. NOTHING on how the plane flew, how it was designed or its history. Pretty short on anecdotes too.Overall left a lot to be desired, and quite boring to read."
4,Good for the humor value,"This book is more humorous than it is useful. Those looking for actual useful advice should look elsewhere. However as a light, quick read for the humor, it's good. It's not that the book is wrong; actually many of the tips and experiences are far too real. It just doesn't give any really practical advice on what to do about it all."
3,Funny but not really useful,"The guys who wrote this book go more for the laughs than providing real-world advice. Funny book, but if you're seeking serious advice, this is not it."
3,Funny but nothing new,"While I did laugh at a lot of the things the authors brings up, none of it was really new to me. The authors also take the issue of STDs very lightly, something that it seems shouldn't be done in this day and age. There are other better books on the subject out there."
3,"Finally, a guy's perspective!","I'm so sick of those dating books written by women, telling us guys how we should approach them, what to say, what not to say, etc. Hey, the women don't really know what's going on in the male psyche! If they only knew the hell of rejection! They just sit back and sift through the offers. We have to do all of the initial work, and that means relying on our instincts and breaking ""the rules"" to make an impression. Its good to get a male perspective, but this book was a little too casual and silly for me. I wish it would have been a little more honest. There are some other issues--the primal issues--that men struggle with, ie. money and status, our self-esteem, a woman's looks, our sexual needs, which significantly affect the dating process and aren't taken seriously enough here. It was a fun read though."
2,Sophomoric at best,"Bought this as a gag gift for a recently divorced friend. It achieved its purpose. It comes across as a gag...maybe that was the author's idea. Written for the anti-social shy, petrified dork who has no chance with women. Maybe even more so after reading this book. It shares the occasional morsels of truth, but for the most part is written tongue in cheek. This book came out way before all the great PUA titles. Perhaps in its day it was a prize. If you find Mystery Method, et al to be too much to stomach, than give this one a try. Or maybe send it to a friend to make him feel hopeless. Worked for me."
5,Terrible to Conteplate? I Guess is Right!,Since having this book bought by a friend this is one of the successful books a guy can have to know and succeed his dating.It's up to you to place a review on this book but I'm giving it 5 stars! =)
1,Damaged Goods,"The initial DVD was defective. Amazon replaced this promptly. However, the replacement also appears to be defective. Maybe the entire lot is. I am still hoping somehow to see the film"
3,Not bad if your a Guererro fan,"Overall, this DVD set was pretty good. The match from No Way Out was worth the price alone. Would have liked more stories and such but it was good."
4,Viva Eddie.,Great dvd package about Eddie. Lots of incredible matches from a legend that died too soon. The mat hes reaaly show you how talented Eddie was as a performer. Lie. Cheat. Steal...
5,EDDIE GUERRERO FOREVER,This was a great DVD set released by the WWE of Eddie Guerrero! Had gto purchase it to add to my WWE DVD's of superstars! VIVA LA RAZA!
1,Disapointment big time,"Bought this for two reasons. The good reviews it had and I wanted fresh water fish instead of Goldfish.I was completely disappointed. Fish are all drab silver in color, their swimming is very mechanical. Overall the underwater scene is the most boring ever and completely drab. For a little dose of horrible ""realistic"" movements, select the frog.I will now be very happy to go back to my Goldfish aquarium. The colors were so vibrant, the whole fish tank was more realistic than an actual fish tank. Bubbles, movements, water shadows were are superb. I was looking for all of this with this program but it is completely boring and drab to the nth degree. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,It was kinda blah...,"Didn't care much for it, found it boring... but for the price I guess you can't complain much. I only bought it cause of other reviews. The fish where blah not much color. Sounds whern't very great either. But everyone has diffrent tastes. But it just wasn't for me."
1,Replaced Disappointment,"Wrong DVD was in the case, I never had an opportunity to see the WOW 2010. I thought it was very negligent that no one reviewed the inside of the case prior to mailing the product."
2,Great song - Great video - HORRIBLE Audio,"Where in the WORLD is the high-res audio mix? What a let-down.The commentary is pretty funny - no matter what people are saying - exactly what fans of Tool should expect from the band.I sure hope the new record is released with high-res audio of some sort. I mean, Lateralus was HDCD. You'd think SACD or DVD-A would be the next step for any new material. I guess I better not get my hopes up, right?"
1,A Gift From Tool,This is a wonderful DVD full of material to keep you interested for days??? Blair said this is gift from the band... In my life I didn't have to pay for a gift that was given to me. In order to keep this tradition I'm downloading the whole thing from the net for 0$ as gifts should cost. I think that after all these years of enlightnement guys from Tool won't mind. Peace.
1,Way too little too late,"These two singles are utter garbage. Sure, we get the videos on DVD, thats great and I'm not complaining about that, but couldn't they put better audio on the discs? 2 channel 192 AC3, I mean really how cheap. There should have been at least PCM streams (like Salival) or maybe 5.1 mix to make it all worth while. The audio quality of the CD which was released in HDCD is better than whats on these DVDs. No wonder I could not find any info on what audio was on the discs before I bought, they didn't want us to know or people like me would not have bought them. Hopefully the new album won't be available only on 8-track cassette."
3,We want more Tool(s)!,"Not completely satisfied with this DVD. Pakaging and content are great. However, this video along with the Parabola DVD release should have been included in a new 2-DVD set with all the Tool videos and and live DVD. Not that this may not already be in the works for the future but, with 2 non-lp remix tracks that make their first appearance on the DVDs and nowhere else, it leaves fans wanting more."
4,It's Tool,"Some say Maynard is god. I say, ""has there every been a bad Tool song?"" Adam does another get job in this video.. If you get a chance, watch it. Enjoy art at it rarest form."
4,Where's the Grudge?,"Why all the negitive petty complaining about the PCM streams (like Salival) or maybe 5.1 mix HDCD,2 channel 192 AC3? It dosn't matter, get over it. DON'T BE A TOOL. Hear, Think, See, Feel. Get over your shrinking shelf. Stop crying about packaging and how much you had to pay 599 never killed anyone."
3,What we really need is a complete Tool video collection,"I bought this just so I could add at least one Tool video to my collection. The video for Schism is itself pretty cool. It's just what you expect from a Tool video. It's visually interesting in a nightmarish kind of way. It makes you wonder at the symbolism involved. And the fits well above the actual song. The problem is that I'm not going to be purchasing any more of these at the $10 price tag. Hopefully, there will be a future DVD release that contains all the Tool videos. That would be an outstanding product!!"
4,Finally,It's about time decent versions of these videos were made avaliable to those of us who care.
1,Where's the new music?,"Terrible. Does not deliver. Video and new graphics are cool. But don't buy this expecting to hear something quality. This is not Tool, this is a remix done by Lustmord and it is trash. The new Tool will rock, it just has too."
2,Also a waiste of money,"This review is the same as my Parabole review, but here it is again if you see this first, because it is worth repeatingIf you are a fair weather fan, don't waist the money. This is only one track and not worth it. This is a good song off an album that is loosing it's zip. The video is a standard tool video, claymation and bizarre images. However, other than the first track, the rest is just a waste of time and money. The audio comentary is not funny, and makes tool look like fools (but with a some of my money, and me feeling used.) The bonus remix is nothing but an extension 8 minutes of ambient noise before the same song. If you want real trance like meditation like music, listen to Neurosis, they have been doing this for 15 years and are a lot better at it. Tool better have a heck of a next album to dig themselves out of this embarassment. The only reason I don't give this a 1 is that I do like the packaging, and the video is nice to add to Salival in my collection."
3,nice book...for a girl,"nice book. uses very few big words, but stll manages to put her point across perfectly. characters are so many. you'll probably need a paper to jot em down while reading so you won't forget. but they're well developed and very real. storyline very girlish (read the book out of boredom), that's probably why i'll give it 3 stars."
2,Battery schmattery,"I had high hopes for this battery for my Nikon camera. It promised more MAH than the OEM battery that came with the camera. Unfortunately, it must be leaking electrons all over the place, since a charge in this model does not compare to the original. I would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original Nikon battery. The price was cheap and you get what you pay for. If you are going to purchase this one, get two since you'll need to keep one charging while using the other. Cheers!"
1,Another Nikon Battery RipOff,"We gave this item 1 star because we were forced to do so. It deserves none. The item, sold as a 1500 mAh battery for the Nikon Coolpix 8700 (and others) arrived clearly labeled as an 800 mAh battery. So far, it has functioned almost as such, giving us about the same number of exposures as one would expect for a 700 mAh btty. Why does Amazon advertise it as twice the capacity? The reason is clear to us. Warning: Watch out for this manufacturer."
3,Early TENEBRE,"This early 90s Swedish thrash/death metal evolved into TENEBRE who turned out one of the best CDs of the late 90s ""Grim Ride"" and two of the best from this decade ""Electric Hellfire Kiss"" (02)and ""Heart's Blood"" (05). Tenebre, however, are Goth metal, not unlike Danzig, 69 Eyes or HIM on a good day. Flegma were two-chord speed/black metal with little creativity. Not bad but Flegma are only recomended to hardcore Tenebre fans."
2,Not what I expected,"The reason I purchased this book is because it billed itself as a great reference/sourcebook. In my mind, that meant a place to get ideas for contemporary home improvements, as well as a means to make them actually happen. I envisioned a book that showed a photo of a (kitchen, floor, bathroom, some tile, etc.), discuss the actual materials used in EACH setting, and where possible, where they can be found. While there are a few basic references of this type, the bulk of the book gives the name of whatever architect contributed to each setting and then describes the shot in great detail, yet with hardly any information about what's IN it. In addition, many of the pictures are too small/shot too close up/at odd angles to get a lot out of them. I'm sorry, but I did not find this book helpful."
3,The details are not exactly what I was looking for,"Although I do not own a copy for myself, I intended to purchase it. The pictures are wonderful and there are a myriad of products. But, while browsing through a copy at my local bookstore I realized that the items pictured where not exactly my taste. The fixtures and furnishings are definitely modern, but tend to have an extremely hard edge. I love contemporary interior design, but something a little softer, a little less abstract. If you are interested in that end of the contemporary spectrum, then go for it. If you are like me, you may be dissapointed."
4,Great for the convenience,"Thai tea brewed fresh in a restaurant is always going to taste better. For something convenient out of a package, this is pretty good. I like having it on hand for a treat, because brewing authentic Thai tea from the powder is very annoying and I've never quite gotten it right. Some people may find it a bit sweet."
3,Could have been better,"I gave this book only 3 stars because I found it one of the dullest tales of the most fascinating events in history, the marriage of King Henry to Anne Boleyn. Though that its more about one of Anne's ladies than of herself, there is so much more detail the author could have gone into but didn't. There is so much more to the story than was put in, and I was hoping that the tale would have started during the early years of their courtship. Oh well. The story was good, though lacking in some aspects, and I would recommend it for a quick read that doesn't require much thinking."
3,"Not bad, but not great","This wasn't my favorite book about Anne, but it wasn't bad. If your looking for something to read, I would recommend picking it up, but its not something I would go out of my way to find."
4,Pretty good,"I read this book to learn more about Anne Boleyn. I am aware that it is FICTION. After reading THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL, I thought this book was excellent. Unlike BOLEYN GIRL, Lady Raised High portrays Anne Boleyn as a gentle kind person who gets angry and have bad days instead of portraying her as a complete arrogant idiot. The only thing I regret is that it starts with Anne & Henry already together and doesn't tell alot of what she might have been thinking."
2,2 stars,"Frances Pierce, as one of Anne Boleyn's lady's maids, has a unique perspective on the conflict that brought her mistress to power, and then to her fall. Even as Anne comes into favor, then begins to fall from it when she fails to bear Henry a son, Frances' own fortunes wax and wane. Often driven to tears by the capricious royal moods, Frances suffers the good as ill with as much grace as possible. Even her own marriage lies under the cloud of the court.** It is difficult to define a true plotline in this story. Frances does provide a different sort of look at one of the most infamous love affairs of history. However, her own story is somewhat distracting from the more interesting royal one. **Amanda Killgore"
2,Readers Beware!!,"I enjoyed the first Laurien Gardner book,and bought this one right away, expecting the same quality historical read. But this one didn't have the same passion or detail, and I didnt' care about the characters at all. I couldn't figure it out, until I read on a readers board that the books are written by different writers and the name LAUREN GARDNER is a HOAX.Maybe this isn't so bad as the James Fry books, but still if readers buy a book with a certain writers name on it, they deserve to get a book by that writer, not someone else. It's a FRAUD and it's not fair to readers.I will think twice about buying a LAUREN GARDNER book again. Writers and publishers, don't do this to readers or we will stop buying your books!"
2,Too much hearts and flowers,"I have to agree with the previous review; I found the book to be more girly than upscale. Fortunately, I bought the book used, so it wasn't much of an investment. But, yes, if you're looking for ""Cinderella"", you might find tons of romantic ideas that can keep you within a budget. This book is useful as a starting point, to get your creative juices going. If you're looking for truly unique, memorable, and modern, this book is not for you."
2,Too Cruel,"I've loved every Alice Hoffman book I've ever read and waited with anticipation until this one was shipped.Unfortunately I almost did not finish it. Something about Gus touched me and when the river king was discovered I was devastated. So much so that I skipped ahead in the book to see what had truly happened. At that point I put the book on the shelf and left it there for over a week.Thinking surely that justice would prevail I went back only to be disappointed. The magic of Alice Hoffman could not overcome the cruelty Gus endured. Nothing about the book could overshadow the hazing that took the life of a teenager struggling as so many do through that period of their life.Maybe Ms. Hoffman wanted to shock, if so she succeeded, but this time I was disappointed more than anything."
4,carefully crafted and intriguing,"This book takes a little while to get going, because there is a lot of description and not as much action in the beginning, but it is worth it because Ms. Hoffman creates her setting so painstakingly and convincingly. The book deals with the cruelties and class rifts that occur in a private school and the working-class town where the school is located. The book has riveting images and strong, believable characters. It will probably give some parents second thoughts about sending their children to private school, especially since some of the hazing rituals probably had some grounding in reality."
4,A Pleasurable Read,"The River King, by Alice Hoffman is a well-rounded book. There is the right amount of sentiment, tragedy, and suspense to balance the plot and the overall experience of the book. While this particular work does not excel in any of these categories, it is a nice combination.It is set around the late 1990's at a private high school in the small town of Haddan, Massachusetts. The main story follows the lives of an incoming freshman, a new photography teacher, and a local police officer. Everything plays out in a continuous cycle of events that intertwine and include the past and the present.While The River King may not be the intellectual thriller of Conrad, or have the wildly imaginative characters like in Faulkner, it is good writing for our day and age. The themes are modern and the story is life-like. I would recommend it as a good book to read for pleasure."
2,She wrote this one for Hollywood,"This book is Practical Magic part two.....complete with roses, thorns, frogs and a dead guy. No originality! That is my first complaint! But if you loved Practical Magic, and want to read it again, then this is the book for you!Second, the main character is 15....yet acts as if she is a college freshman. Smoking, sex....all of it....the fact that this is a high school, and we are talking about a bunch of 14 and 15 year olds just doesn't fit the story. I know that high school students do these things, but the WHOLE SCHOOL?Third, there is not as much conflict between the townies and the prep school kids as you would think from the book jacket.Finally, this book is so predictable. I think Hoffman wrote this book so that Hollywood could cut her a big fat check for the screenplay. ""The River King"" starring Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Elijah Wood. Coming to theaters this summer. No thanks."
2,a disappointment,"I've read and greatly enjoyed many of Hoffman's other novels, but here I found one plot point impossible to get past. A boy sporting virtually every one of the signs of a Youth in Crisis, (in a black trench coat, no less!), comes forward to report abuse and nobody takes him seriously? After Columbine? This was hard to swallow.As for the rest, the descriptions (as usual) were beautiful, but there were just too many characters whose stories weren't woven together enough for me to sustain interest in them. Keeping the focus on Betsy Chase, Abel or Carlin might have helped. As it is, Elizabeth George's mystery ""Well Schooled in Murder,"" tells a very similiar story and does it better."
2,"Maybe she's a great writer, but...","I'm unfamiliar with Alice Hoffman's other work, but if this book is indicative of her talent, I'm inclined to remain that way. I have a tendency to continue reading books I dislike, just because I don't like to quit things halfway through, so I kept on reading well past the point I had begun to wonder ""why am I reading this?"". The plot is as worn as an old shoe and the reader must continually endure schmaltzy references to the ""mysterious wafting scent of roses"" indicating - what? A ghostly indication of the character's victimhood? As if we didn't recognize this on our own? The characters seem to have been ripped straight out of a melodrama, complete with fainting spells and evil sneers. And the ending is just halfhearted. There's sure to be a movie, where at least the only wafting odor will be that of popcorn."
5,A deeply moving novel that has a sorrowful tone,"I bought this book on instinct after reading the plot summary and I was not dissapointed. I have read other books by Alice Hoffman and I thought this was probably one of her best.Actually, this books is quite sad and the mood throughout is very melancholy. In most cases a sad book is not always enjoyable, however, I was deeply moved and at times I was on the verge of tears.I must say that I found similarities between The River King and the novel ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tarrt. Both are based around a small elite college campus that have beautiful houses and mysterious going-ons. I highly reccomend reading Donna Tarrt's novel as well if you enjoy The River King.Overall I found the book to be enjoyable and magical even with its sad plot and melancholy characters. I finished reading this book in one evening because I simply could not put it down."
3,Hmmm...just OK,"I do have to agree that Hoffman has a very lyrical and flowing style of writing, which I like; however, I kept getting caught up by her sometimes wierd analogies. It was like she was sometimes focusing more on how the words 'sounded' rather than if they made sense together. Then, she would sometimes contradict herself...like the night sky was as black as coal and then two sentences later the sky was illuminated by starlight (not the exact wording, but you get what I mean). Overall, I didn't hate it, but I'm not sure I will read Hoffman again...it's just OK."
5,Beautiful and haunting book,"OK, first I will tell you that if you aren't able to let yourself inside of a book and allow yourself to believe things you normally would not, you will not like this book. However, if you are a reader who loves to escape into a book, to truly feel and experience things that are not every day - then this is a book you will find to be disturbing, beautiful and full of sensory images you can almost touch. Find a quiet room and immerse yourself."
3,An Empty River,"As a fan & avid reader of all Alice Hoffman books, I was left longing for more. Page after page, I continued to look for the magic, beauty of her prose, the appreciation of everyday life & nature that I had come to know from her storytelling.Her writing seemed old, lazy & repetitive of her past novels. Perhaps, a first time reader of her books would enjoy this read. However, I would strongly recommend Turtle Moon & Seventh Heaven to experience the magic, emotion & poetry of Ms. Hoffman."
3,Not impressed..,"I like Alice Hoffman as a writer, and this book certainly had the potential to be a pot boiler. Great characters, nice magical references, but it appears Alice got to a certain page and decided to wrap it up. No ryhme, no reason.The plot did not deserve this ending. I'm left feeling very unfulfilled. I'm not even certain of the reason for the name of the book, let alone why one of the better characters is killed off early on and we're not ever given a satisfactory reason. And then other characters appear but don't seem to stay around of have any purpose, like Sean Byers.And Betsy running away with Abe???? The pharmacist suddenly discussing everything with his wife. This isn't the result of magic, but lack of imagination maybe? None of the actions or character/plotline prepares the reader for the way Alice wraps up a tidy little ending, unfit for the great beginning. Quite a let down. Did Alice run out of steam on this one? I won't give up on Hoffman, but this was not her best effort."
2,Disappointing,"I've been a fan of Alice Hoffman's for several years, having read and enjoyed almost all of her books. However, I didn't like *The River King* because (1) the magical realism was too heavy-handed and (2) there were too many false details, such as a character wandering around in the country looking at Joe Pye weed blooming in the Spring, or some such silliness. Just as I would begin to get lost in the narrative, some errant detail would bring me back to the realization that I could not willingly suspend my disbelief. I gave up on this novel about one hundred pages into it."
3,"Simplistic story, yet satisfying","Good linear storytelling, but a bit heavy-handed at times as far as the symbolism goes. It was compelling at times, but I expected all of the supernatural elements to be tied together a bit more cohesively in the end. Good beach/gym reading, but not great literature."
2,It's the humidity!!!,"In THE RIVER KING, strange meteorological events are always happening in the town of Haddam where the story takes place. It's hot or cold at the wrong time, or strange things fall from the sky. The climate seems to affect the populace to an unusual degree, as Hoffman gives us repeated descriptions of ailments and strange nervous conditions. The plot involves a long-dead headmaster's wife with a love of roses, and strange scents always seem to be popping up. Everyone is nervous, or sad, or loopy with love. Unfortunately, Hoffman commits the great error of all freshman comp students, she tells us rather than shows us. Almost nothing happens in the last 3/4 of the book, but Hoffman attaches great importance to it all without explaining what anything means. I found her rather cool, detached, omniscient narrator to be a distraction, as she gives equal weight to everything in the story. All in all, a disappointment."
3,Are you Alice Hoffman fan?,"You have to be a true Hoffman's fan to fully enjoy it. If you are not, you may find yourself wondering through pages looking for something more. There are no tricks or surprises. Some parts in the book are disturbing but mostly is it predictible life story of several people from small New England town. Although the novel is written in beautiful poetic language, I wish the characters spoke more for themselves - there are hardly any dialogs or conversations. But if you are simply looking for enjoyable reading, this may be a book for you."
2,wished I waited for the used paperback,... I found the plot and characters only marginally interesting and the ending rather ho hum for a supposed murder mystery. I guess I am spoiled by my favorite writers... .
1,Terrible book!,Is it a ghost story? A love story? A murder mystery? A coming of age story? This book hits on all of these things in passing and fails at each and every one. The character development is awful- she sets up the characters with one personality and then immediately has them act in the exact opposite way. New characters are introduced halfway through the book. Don't waste your time or money!!!!!
2,Hard to believe yet predictable,"This was pretty grim and predictable. It sort of meandered ( like a river?) without really comimg to a conclusion that was believable. The adults behaved like adolescents, while the street-wise, over-exposed children ""acted"" like ""adults""? I didn't feel much empathy for anyone, except the older teacher, who seemed like the only real character in the book ( and the cat)."
1,not believable,"Excuse me but isn't this an expensive and exclusive school? Don't the parents of these sutdents expect something more than everyone, students and staff alike, sneaking around at all hours. These students are supposed to be in high school. Does no one care if they don't show up for meals or stay out all night drinking, smoking an having sex. Is this really what goes on in boarding schools or did I just stumble into one of the poorest examples of education? Puhleese, spare me."
3,"Not her best, though","Alice Hoffman is one of my fav authors. This is not one of her best here. It got very boring at times, and i had to keep reading just because she is one of my favs to finish the bk. She did have success with the descriptions of the locations in this bk. If you are a Hoffman fan, try here on earth or Illumination Night."
4,Good Light Read,"This book is a wonderful light read. It's a ghost story. It's a love story. It's a story about regrets and family. The story contains many surprises throughout the book that keep the reader from putting it down. I only gave it four stars because it didn't pull me in emotionally (it didn't make me cry or laugh). If you like books with a good mix of reality and mysticism, you'll like this one."
3,Predictable yet fun,"""The River King"" is a somewhat predictable tale where fantasy and ghosts meet reality. Set in a small town private Massachusetts boarding school, the characters are weaved together with precision and grace as they develop within the confines of the town's sorrowful history. I particularly liked her style of jumping from one character to another mid-paragraph, as the story progresses to reveal the inner-workings of this mysterious town. Though not the best Hoffman book I have read, the reader will not be disappointed in her latest work."
2,Not for me.,"The River King grabbed me at the begining with the pleasant prose and I have to give Hoffman credit for inspiring me to emphathize with intelligent, basically kind people who are failures (except for Carlin).But before long I got very frustrated with the multiple fainting spells and swooning attacks, and characters who have to take to bed for a week after a shock, have to be carried upstairs after seeing a dead rabbit, and have to breath into a paper bag. It was weird and creepy and after a while every time it happened I wanted to throw the book against the wall.Maybe Hoffman is a good writer, and maybe this is supposed to be some sort of dark fairytale written with a Victorian aesthetic that I lack the sophistication to appreciate. But I thought it was lousy."
4,Another great read by Hoffman,"Again, I am amazed by Alice Hoffman and the lyrical quality of her writing. I am also spellbound by how easily she moves in and out of what we consider the natural world. Although we know this is purely fictional, it really makes one wonder about the paranormal and the effects of such on the living world. Again, Hoffman brings us a great cast of characters, although I found myself wanting to know more about them. I found her characterization in perious novels to be much deeper, so I felt somewhat disappointed that I didn't get to know Betsy and Carlin and Gus a bit better. Also, the secondary characters are left as just that - secondary and flat. However, it's a great story overall and I would recommend reading it."
2,Disappointing,"This book missed the mark for me. I did read it, but I did not find it necessarily engaging. I think that this may have been targeted for a younger audience. It was dark in an odd way - not like Practical Magic, however. I felt a little cheated when I finished the book - I did not have that 'good' feeling that comes after having read a 'good' book.I do appreciate Alice Hoffman's talent, but I did not feel this book showcased it as well as others have. I much preferred A Probable Future."
2,Unusual case of movie being better than the book,"This represents one of the few instances in which I actually saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw the movie, I found it moderately captivating. I was drawn into the story and really felt a connection to the characters (however, I have to add I was ill at the time and cannot rule out this reaction being an effect of the fever). In any event, seeing the movie moved me to read the book. I was overall a bit disappointed. The book just never seemed to capture my attention. I never seemed to enjoy the characters or the story and I felt the movie director did a much better job of making the characters real and moving. This is the first time I have ever felt a movie outperformed the book the movie is based on. This is my first time to read a book by this author. To me, it was just ""okay"", and I don't believe I will be reading any of her other works."
4,NEW VIBES IN TOWN,"There's not much competition when it comes to playing the vibes, but even if there were, Matthias Lupri would whup most of them. The Boston based musician doesn't sound like Milt Jackson or Gary Burton or Lionel Hampton or any of the other mallet-wielding patriarchs, and his intense writing distinguishes him even more so.Verbole's ballsy sax is a perfect foil, the two of them weaving in and out of each other's paths, sometimes at a ferocious pace as on ""Freefall."" Lots of tempo changes midtune, the band holds itself together by the telepathic rhythm section. It's obviously a tight group, given that the entire, impressive album was recorded in one afternoon. This is definitely a band worthy of greater recognition.--JazzNow Magazine - April 1999"
5,a new master of the jazz-vibraphone,"it's been a long time since we have heard a fresh new voice on the vibraphone. with Matthias Lupri, that voice has arrived. a must for any fan of contemporary 'straight-ahead' jazz"
5,Love this book !,"Great Book. Easy read, this book just grabbed your attention from start to finish. I would be sure to read more books from this author."
4,Don't interrupt me dammit!,"Whew now this book was a refreshing release. I laughed so hard throughout this book that my jaws were hurting eyes were watering and stomach ached. I loved this book, everything about this book was good. The only thing I had to get a hang of were the names; Mavis and Darien( maybe Darien is pronounced differently). Those names are male names...well I've only heard of males with those names. I was us to the southern speech being as how all my family( mother aunts and uncles) were born and raise in the south. I laughed at the fact that Ms. Leslie spelled the word 'get' as 'git' now that was nice because that is how its pronounced down south.This was my first time reading Leslie Edailes work. I enjoyed every bit of it so I am going to check out some more of her work just to see if there's something else that I would want to read by her.Will recommend..."
2,I couldn't read it,"I feel bad because everyone loved this book, but I couldn't read it. Maybe its just not my type of book"
2,High hopes ... not close to being met,"As a huge fan of sports from the 60s and 70s I had very high hopes for this book but was disappointed. The content is very superficial with much much more focus on Chief's trivia than the Chief's history. Their are numerous interesting pictures but the only color one is the one on the cover. Finally, I found the layout of the book awkward to look up the answers to the triva questions. There are tens of pages of trivia with the answers all in the back of the book without the questions repeated; you will spend the majority of your time flipping back and forth trying to match answers with questions."
4,Beautiful Romantic movie,"At first i was not a fan of Rani untill i watched "" Saathiya"", or Ajay untill i watched this movie "" chori chori"", Both actors performance were great. The movie is a romatnic comedy, the kind that makes you feel good watching it.The movie is a parody of the american movie "" House sitter"" which i watched in 1993 and liked. Its about a guy who proposes to his childhood sweetheart by buying her a house but she turns him down. Then he meets Rani who works in a hotel and shows her a pic of the house. Thinking he wont be using the house anymore, she goes looking for the house after she was kicked out by her boss and she settles there. The whole town mistakes her for Ajay new fiancee. When he comes back he makes a pact with Rani to act like they are in love to make his childhood sweetheart jealous and thats when the fun begins.Personally i fell in love with the movie."
4,Charming Early Sondheim,"Judging by previous reviewers, this seems to be a very under-appreciated CD. Yes, the piano accompaniment can be a little off-putting at first (especially in the more densely harmonic songs like ""Silly People""), this CD is still worth buying for the beauty of these songs. So Craig Lucas isn't a top-notch singer/actor. His voice is certainly pleasant enough, and I love his ""Uptown/Downtown"" and ""Happily Ever After."" Suzanne Henry is also more than acceptable, shining on ""So Many People"" and ""Can That Boy Fox-Trot.""After a person listens to this CD, he'll probably want to see the show. And isn't that the ultimate goal of all cast albums?"
4,Very entertaining snippets of a precocious Sondheim.,"Marry Me a Little has some really wonderful pieces that the avid Sondheim listener will recognize in later shows. Especially appealing, was the song ""What more do I need?"". The brilliant lyrics presented in this song will spark a familiar view of life in the city. Also, the title song, ""Marry Me a Little"" (which was later revived in the hit musical ""Company"") is a very thoughtful look at relationships and committment. Other notable songs this listener particularly enjoyed were ""Bang"", ""Saturday Night"" (a personal favorite) and ""So Many People"". This original cast recording is a precocious Sondheim at his best. Although, the later works are much more sophistocated, this first presentation of Sondheim is a very auspicious and entertaining work. I highly enjoyed it and recommend it highly to not only Sondheim fans but all listeners!!!"
2,Morose,"I am a Sondheim fanatic. Having said that, I will now go on to say that ""Marry Me a Little"" is one of the worst Sondheim recordings I have ever heard. The synopsis to the CD said that Sondheim was reluctant to put on a revue that contained songs cut from other shows. If only he had trusted his instincts in this case! Musically the songs are underorchestrated and the lyrics are gloomy. ""Happily Ever After"" contains many lyrics that are later included in ""Being Alive;"" yet while ""Being Alive"" celebrates marriage, both the good and the bad, ""Happily Ever After"" is just downright nasty. ""Bang"" and ""Marry Me a Little"" are used more effectively in ""Putting it Together."" ""Pour le Sport"" is affected and stilted. I looked at the date of the CD and saw that it was recorded only a month before ""Merriy We Roll Along"" which I consider to be one of the finest Sondheim recordings available. Every artist has works which are not up to standard; the ""Marry Me a Little"" CD should be dismissed as one of those."
3,Well..,"The songs are hard to find, but the recording is mediocre. These people are not the greatest vocal talents in the world, and ocassionally they come off harsh. Then there is the piano. Some of these songs are quite energetic, and the piano does not do them justice. It is really quite boring sometimes. There are some high points though. ""The Girls of Summer"", ""Bang"", ""Saturday Night"", and the title song. Buy it you are a Sondheim completeist, or a fan who likes the obscure Sondheim, rather than ""Send in the Clowns""."
2,Great Material Dreadfully Arranged,"The only reason to purchase this disc is for its collection of hard to find Sondheim songs. The piano accompaniment is uninspired, and the two voices border on annoying. Such gems as ""So Many People"" and ""All Creatures/Bang"" earn the two stars."
1,Unfortunate,"The product was poorly crafted, the edges uneven, and overall a disappointment. The photo does not accurately reflect the thickness of the ring. The seam where the two ends were joined was blued from sodering and incomplete. The only saving grace was that I didnt spend much."
2,Not a well made r/c car,"Delivered scuffed and dirty, the windshield is either very poorly structured or just didn't fit as it pushed right in and would not go back into place. Had lights in the back window that lit up, but basically did not do anything else. Was not what our son was looking for in an r/c car."
5,Wait til Your Mother Gets home,"This movie is far better than the theatrical production, Mr. Mom starring Micheal Keaton. This movie is based on a real story, and all the characters are based on real people. The humor in this movie is true from the heart, in real situations. It can easily translate to any family economic situation. It is a simple story told with much love, affection, humor and truth. I have been looking for a copy of this movie since it first aired on television in 1984 ( I believe). Since I seldom watch movies at all, and have a poor memory, the mere fact that I have retained the name and love for this movie speaks strongly, at least to me."
5,"Great message in movie, delivered with sensitivity","Glaser does a convincing job as a dad and school football coach. His bemusement at the start of the movie about how his stay-at-home-mom wife never seemed to get on top of the homemaker job transforms into a new respect for her when, outside his control, he loses his job and his wife gets offered one of her own. It takes about 24 hours on his new job as stay-at-home-DAD for everything to fall apart around him.Each job switch gives each spouse a new perspective and respect for the other. It's not just a ""husband wakes up movie"".GREAT family viewing, especially for any family where there is a stay-at-home-mom working hard to keep the show together.Funny throughout. Great for all ages- no guns, violence or foul language. I can't believe it's not on Netflix or Blockbuster."
5,Enthralling....,"I've owned this book for about a year now and can't get enough of it. The pictures are so vibrant and beautiful, it's become a favorite in my ""library"". I recently ordered the India Style book and look forward to it's arrival. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in exotic design ideas or if you simply love Moroccan design."
4,Chris again,Chris Smither is one of those rare artists who has the talent to be able to turn the most mundane subjects into music that sounds fantastic. People reading this may already be familiar with his uncanny musicianship using the most simple gear but some may not be aware of the sheer beauty of his poetry. This is a terrific album. Do yourself a favour and give it a listen.
5,Removes blinders from the eyes of any sociologist.,"This book examines the practice of social science from several angles, like turning a sea shell slowly in your hand, looking at the curves and openings and aspects. The author accomplishes this by looking at social science through the eyes of empirical, phenomenological, critical, and analytical social scientists.Sound boring? It isn't -- and you can learn from each perspective. You can also learn why there is no one right approach. Some questions fit better into one framework, some into another. Any social scientist who weds him/herself to a given approach is wearing blinders. This book removes those limitations. Ideologies become tools for social examination. This book should be the starting point for any social science student."
5,Terrific,"After such a long time we get this jewel from Melissa Manchester. I'm happy to see that the wait has been well worth it. Her voice is golden and like a fine wine, has improved over the years."
5,Beth's review - Cosmic Ray's book,"This is my third copy of the Cosmic Ray book; the other copies have been ""borrowed"" and not returned. The maps are amusing, and it fits into a jacket pocket pretty easy...Good book if you like a cartoon type picture."
5,Favorite Hikes: Flagstaff & Sedona by Cosmic Ray,"Just got back from Arizona- and we used this book extensively as it was easy to read, the maps accurate, and the book is quite entertaining. My 6 year old son stated that the Lava River Cave trail ""changed his life"" (in a good way). The trail trips turned out to be the highlight of our trip!! The authors advise is excellent and the designation of level of difficulty is on target."
4,Makes hiking fun!,"Cosmic Ray is a fun guy. You get the feeling he could make anything sound interesting. Lucky you! He chose to publish his favorite hikes in the Flagstaff - Sedona region! Trail maps are wacky. Most certainly fun to look at, just keep in mind they're not 100% accurate. Each trail includes information such as distance, time, effort and such. I've hiked all the Sedona trails listed. It kind of surprised me to find out Marg's Draw would make anybody's list of favorite trails. Then again that's my personal opinion. It's still a cool book. I've used the book on several outings to the area. The elevation profiles are rough but very much appreciated! This is a nice book to get you interested in hiking."
5,Great film of old school martial arts,"Ok , why these clowns above me shot this great David Chaing film down is beyond me, I seen this film in drive in's when it came to the US.This film has tons of great martial art and sword action that is uncomparable to any sword films ive seen even Kurosawa's movies. Only because of sure number of swings and balance from the movie's heroes and villians make this a rare piece of film making, unlike most films i counted over 100 plus dead in the final fight scenes. David Chiang played a great role of a self pity master swordsman , that reflects just how low a man can go in own life and spirit and then take revenge. I think out of the 200 plus martial art/sword films ive seen over the last 40 years i put this in the top 10 of all time martial art films. Too bad everyone is so spoiled over Bruce Lee and the latest street fighting style movies to come along in the last 20 years. There missing a great treat in the New One Armed Swordsman aka Triple Irons"
2,The cards are beautiful BUT,Two of my cards appear to be a misprint. One with Ace with 2 of clubs face. The other 2 of Clubs with Ace of Diamond face. Strange? Anyone else see this?
1,Nothing like being up to date,I have seen this Rosie Flores album on your opening page for well over a year if not longer. Don't you change these albums or is Rosie sleeping with Mr. Bezos? Common guys...use your space better.
4,supported on Linux,"dm9601 chipset. Supported on Linux, but only very recent versions (2.6.21 or later).Unfortunately not supported by the version of Linux included in latest Debian GNU/Linux release."
3,Power hungry adapter works with Linux,"Works with Linux, which is all I use.Sucks up six (!) watts!! Holy cow, that's quite piggish, but if you need it, you need it.Does not do simultaneous bi-directional 100BT, sometimes called 200BT (which is nonsense). In fact, if you try to pump simultaneous bi-directional 100BT, the throughput seesaws back and forth between the directions. But if you're just trying to use it to access the internet, this really shouldn't matter."
4,stuck with me like a fishbone,"My roomie had to read this for a class and she left it on the table over break and I never read poetry before so I thought why not but wow this book blew me away. I love how this poet uses neat scientific ideas to color her metaphors even more. You can tell she is a nature fan, in almost every poem, even the ones about relationships, there is a smidge of small but extraordinary moments observed in nature, it helps make her experiences come alive to me even more. Nezhukummatathil can be funny too, and sarastic, and sensuous. A hard feat to accomplish all three!! You can tell she seems real and doesn't take herself too seriously. Seriously, like I said, I NEVER read poetry, but this little book was quick and easy and a delight to read. My only problem was that it was too short? When will she write more???! Highly recommended."
4,Fullmetal Alchemist 2 Exceeds the First.,"This game is far better than the first one. In terms of graphics, the game far exceeds ""Broken Angel"" due to the fact that the characters are now cell shaded and look more like the anime versions. The game play is also better because you are given many more melee attacks then in the first where all you could do was use your arm blade. In this game, Ed can kick, punch, dodge and still pull off all his famous alchemic works. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a Fullmetal Alchemist fan and anyone else who as ever wanted to perform alchemy on anything or anyone."
4,Fullmetal Alchemist,"I purchased this product for my 14 year old daughter. She is a huge Anime fan and a fan of this show in particular. She was very excited to recieve it and has spent several hours enjoying it. The game has good art and graphics. It follows a good story line and stays true to the shows characters. She did say that this game is easier then the first one. I'm not sure if that is due to the game or her being more adept at the game since learning on the first one. Overall, this is a good game and not just a blood and guts slasher thing. I recommend it."
5,miller's the best,This is an excellent example of the Glasgow blues singer at his best. Well woth promoting as the best blues voice of his day.
4,Used for Self Study,"I used this book for an independent study of linear algebra in undergrad. I'd had no prior exposure to the field, but had taken very good real analysis and abstract algebra courses prior. My self-study was quite effective, which is a testament to the book, since it was essentially the only material I had. (There were a few typos I remember seeing, as well as some unclear formulas/notation here and there, hence the four stars, but nothing serious)."
3,"OK, but could be better.",The book sometimes eliminates using some symbols when the meaning is clear from the context; this is OK only if you either have prior understanding of the material presented or easy access to an expert.
2,Shoddy Construction,"I've just gotten this book, so I can't speak to the content, but I can speak to the construction. One day after I picked up the book, which I bought new, one side of the spine detached from the side of the pages.I mean, seriously?"
5,Beautiful Movie all around!!!,"This movie demonstrates the results of a big ego and of looking out only for your own wants and needs... then the second half shows how being a selfless person can not only make others benefit, but also gets you what you want when you're genuinely selfless and giving. There is also excellent music and Elizabeth Taylors great beauty at its best to set the scene. I'ts a pity this is not on DVD. The ending is REALLY great!!!"
3,RHAPSODY,"RHAPSODY IS SPECTACULAR FOR ITS LOCATIONS AND LIZ'S WARDROBE. TWO OF THE MOST HANDSOME MALE ACTORS, VITTORIO GASSMAN & JOHN ERICSON, ARE RARELY SEEN IN AMERICAN MOVIES. THE MAIN ATTRACTION IS THE MUSIC, ESPECIALLY THE 2ND PIANO CONCERTO RACHMANINOFF, PLAYED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY A WONDERFUL ORCHESTRA. THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE DIFFICULTIES OF LOVE."
3,The Music is the Star.,I bought this because a dear friend was one of the violinists as a young man and enjoyed it very much. The disc did not play on one Zenith DVD player but did on another one. The music was fantastic especially when the supervising violinist was standing behind Vitorio Gassman playing the violin as if Gassman was playing - amazing! Elizabeth Taylor was perfect as the spoiled little rich girl and Louis Calhern wonderful as her father.
2,Two reasons to get this movie; the young Liz and the music,"This movie is standard 1950's soap. What makes it worth a look are two factors; the splendid classical music (though I agree with one of the other reviewers that there were too many reaction shots) and the beauty of the young Elizabeth Taylor, as annoying as her character might be."
2,music and trash,"Glorious music and glorious robes for Liz Taylor. Butmy God what a trashy story - yes, of course the woman has to be selfless, of course she has no talent whatsoever. This is how girls were taught to be dummies...."
1,Could not watch it,"Received the title just in time for a gift, and did not notice that the cd box was damaged on the back until the box was opened. My mistake was not inspecting the CD box properly when I took it out of the shipment box that seemed to be in perfect condition.Once opened and unsealed I new I could not return it. Tried to watch the movie and my player rejected it.I will purchase the movie again, but not with this seller as they should have detected the problem when packaging."
1,doesn't wink any longer,"This product is not worth the money. It worked great the first year but now will not wick. It just blows dry air around. I have cleaned it as directed and changed filters. It has a great warranty but when I called and asked to get a replacement through Holmes, I can't get one until sometime next spring. Why can Amazon and other retailers get them? Oh well, will look for some other brand now."
3,Good and Bad,First the bad. This humidifier only holds 6.4 Gal max. Everything I could find on is said it holds more but it doesn't. Most humidifiers I've ever seen the wicks lasts longer. I'm going to try to clean the wick when it's time to change it before buying more. The tanks are rounded at the top so they don't stand when filling them. Fair is fair now for the good. I found one for $80. It does well for the price and doesn't look bad. I use it on high most of the time and the noise isn't bad. The medium setting isn't loud at all. Holmes does sell replacement wicks on the site in there booklet for as low as $9.34 if you buy 5 or more and at times they have free shipping.
2,"Cheaply manufactured, awkward to use, looking for replacement","I came here to read reviews because I just filled this one with water I think for the last time( I have to run upstairs and check if it is leaking).Rubber gaskets on tank covers just crumbled and it does not stop water from flowing continusly. One is still working and somehow plyable, so maybe it will work for a few hours,but definitely I will not leave it overnight. Had to empty one tank to prevent overflowing. It is my second winter of using it.I have had humidifiers in my home for over 15 years now, and find Bionaire used to be the best. I say used to, because they do not make the models I used to love any longer.Giving it 2 stars since it lasted for two seasons unlike others that had to be replaced every winter.It is noisy, very awkward to fill with water, cheap plastic with sharp edges. Not to mention terrible filter."
1,Be prepared for tons of Maintenance,"I used this humidifier throughout the winter season and today I threw it away. The wheels were very cheap and fell off many times. The filters/wicks last anywhere from a week to 20 days. You have to add Anti-bacterial and Anti-scale solution to the water every time you fill the tank. If you don't, you'll have a foul stink in a matter of days.I've switched to a smaller ultrasonic version. So far I'm much happier with the results. This Holmes model sucks! It requires way too much maintenance and the cost for filters and water treatment is ridiculous."
2,I Just Don't Get It,"Sorry band members and friends who gave yourselves 5 stars, you're just not that good -I like bluegrass, alternative country and the Grateful Dead. This CD is a little bit of each of these, but not exactly any one of them.This CD just doesn't work for me.When visting, Amazon sometimes pairs this with Peter Bruntwnell's ""Normal For Bridgewater"", and sometimes with Farmer Not So John's ""Receiver"". NFB and Receiver are two much better albums."
5,I no longer slide off my kitchen stool!,This stuff works VERY well to keep my seat ON the seat while doing OT and PT exercises. Also works well to open jars and bottles. I love it!
5,great stuff,"this product is just what i wanted, fast shipping.... grips things great. very easy to clean,love that its black easy to conceal... thanks"
4,mistrial is evidence of the continuing maturity of Lou Reed,Any person who would give Mistrial any less than four stars obviously has no idea as to what Lou Reed is about and probably would give New York or Rock and Roll Animal a one star rating. Listen to this album next to those two and you will know what I'm talking about.
3,"Oh, fiddlesticks","Several MISTRIAL reviews don't speak well of this Lou Reed album. I don't get it - infectious tunes such as ""Original Wrapper,"" ""No Money Down,"" and ""Mama's Got A Lover"" make this a worthy purchase. Don't know why there's a drum machine and I don't care. Lou Reed's rockin' with wit and wisdom! Declare the bad reviews a mistrial and give MISTRIAL a chance."
3,"Mis-step, slight","A bit of a let-down after the artistic success of the trilogy of Blue Mask/Legendary Hearts/New Sensations, as some of the songs are duds and the drum programming is bothersome, but the album finishes very strong with the emotional punch of the final three tracks. Probably Lou's low point of anything post '81, and it still beats the hell out of most of his early and mid-seventies work."
2,I'll second that: Reed's worst,"What else can I say about this album that Mr. Caratsas hasn't said? Horrible use of drum machines, poorly written and arranged music, bad lyrics, uninspired performances--this has it all. This is the only Lou Reed album I can't even sit through (not counting ""Metal Machine Music"", of course).I guess I like it a little better than Caratsas. I'd give it a star and a half (rounding up to two). I like the droning guitar in ""Video Violence"" and a couple of the other songs are not completely terrible, but no one needs this album, not even hard-core fans. For masochistic completists only."
3,Syncopated Doldrums,"Lou, what were you thinking? Mistrial is driven by, as much as I hate to say it, a drum machine. Set the tempo, turn the machine on, and follow the automated and synthetic beat. Perhaps appropriate for club dancing, but not Reed's street wise sing-speak raving against a violent society. And Reed, like the drum machine, sounds although he's on autopilot - his typical spit and vinegar sarcasm is missing. The shame of Mistrial is that the last three numbers are enticing. `Mama's Got A Lover' is a down and dirty (that's good) rocker with the tongue in cheek line ""I think I'll send him a card on Fathers Day."" `I Remember You' is a charming ballad, and `Tell It To Your Heart' is one of Reed's most lonesome and bittersweet compositions. But three out of ten compositions doesn't lift Mistrial out of the its syncopated doldrums. So how does one equitably rate the ""average"" work of a Rock & Roll genius?"
1,wat are they doing,like other outkast music it sucked like crap. unfortunatly amazon.ca (not that there bad at all) did not let me put -50 stars. it reaks this cd.
3,Common Sense Sisterly advice,"I like Patricia Fripp. I sense she is a smart, genuine person with real heart, and has lots of valuable experience to share with other people who meet the public for a living. I'm sure she'd be great fun to have dinner with. That said, nothing in this short book runs very deep, centered as it is around business anecdotes and focusing on sales, but if you want some idea of how this little English hairdresser achieved success in the American business world as a public speaker and sales coach, this is a quick, painless way to get that idea. Though she quotes her brother a few times (guitar legend Robert), I wouldn't expect this book to give you much insight into his thinking."
3,Decision is still out?,So far so good but I haven't had a chance to do much comparison to other dictionaries on the market. I do like that it is compact and I can take it with me to my bible study class.
2,Bummer,There's a section missing....but I still use it and enjoy the compact size and the lengthy description and scriptural references!
1,"Do NOT ""See This Movie"".","This is one of the worst movies I've seen. It's only not worse than ""Date Movie"" because it's not epically unfunny (it doesn't take a crack at being humorous...I don't think?). It's uninteresting and doesn't make sense. The plot, what is it? The resolution? Seth Meyers is still hot as hell but I wouldn't be surprised if this sucky movie took home a couple Razzies."
4,Carnage,"While I enjoyed this movie and the cast is a strong one, it did not live up to my expectations having seen the stage show, which was quite a bit better. I think maybe it needs the shock value.On the other hand, it showed up quickly and as expected."
3,"Solid, but unspectacular.","Two Couples get together to discuss a fight between their two kids. They spend the entire day arguing with each other, with the discussion beginning friendly enough, then evolving into outright verbal warfare. This film features four top-notch actors, each bringing their own unique gifts to their respective roles. The movie is short and features a few laughs, with the characters trying to maintain a modicum of civility while hurling verbal zingers at one another. This is a solid, if unspectacular film that is worth seeing."
5,Awesome,Sometimes you have to think a whole cast of oscar winners that can be an awful combination but not at all great Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet that was great they should have gotten them in a movie together a lot sooner
2,Did Not Like,This movie is an hour and a half of fighting that is just frustrating to watch. I did not like it.
2,Certainly not Virginia Woolf,"Hmm.Even though the script provides all the necessary elements for a great movie, Jodie Foster (who is normally so capable), overacted annoyingly and remarkably badly, whilst Kate Winslett (equally capable of wonderful work), did not manage much better either. John C Reilly gave a good and controlled performance, but the other male actor also failed to improve the problem.Perhaps the problem lay with the direction. I don't really know, as the film could have been superb. I just realize more and more how difficult it is to get everything just right. ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf"" comes to mind in this context, a movie where parties confronted each other with equal intensity. Only there the mix and the acting was spot-on and the direction masterly."
1,Boring,"I have to say that I respect Roman Polanski as a director and I have often found that I ""like"" (not love) his movies, but this movie just fell flat for me. I thought it was going to be witty, cynical,sarcastic and funny. It was anything but those things. I thought it was boring, boring, boring. There was not anything funny about this movie, just two couples bickering over nothing but their ailing relationships. I would not recommend this movie, unless you need something to help you sleep."
1,"3 strong actors, 1 very week one",christoph waltz was terrible but the direction was even worse. there's a lot of comedy in the writing but it seemed like only kate winslet was the only one who even came close to making it remotely funny. i know why it went to video SO FAST.
2,"A few laughs, mostly boring","I fought turning it off after 20 minutes, but but being stuck on a train I continued to watch hoping it would get better. I didn't."
1,Horrible,This movie was not entertaining. It was not thought provoking and the acting was bad. In a nutshell the movie was boring.
1,"Star cast, crap story.","Don't let the star cast fool you. The story line is weak, the writing is crap and it is overacted to try and make it mean something. Very disappointing and the title is the only believable part of the movie... It is the beginning of carnage of a few great careers. All in all, it's 2 hours of my life that I will never get back."
1,Not Good,"I enjoy watching movies and I like just about any genre, but this is one of the worst movies I have seen. The entire movie is one afternoon with two couples. I rented it because of the stars, but I am so very sorry I did. It is not worth the .99 or $1.99 I paided for it. Save yourself the 2 hours it took to watch it."
1,the single worst movie I have rented in years,This POS was not worthy of taking up digital storage...this movie single handily made me hate Jodie Foster as an actress...I really had to see how much torture I could withstand not to just hit eject and get it the hell out of our home asap...anybody who thinks a single second of this was remotely funny needs to recheck their entire existence..
3,Someone forgot to bring the funny,"After seeing this movie I was surprised to remember that the play had won a Tony Award. So I can't blame the writing. And I can't blame the actors, they are all first rate. I can only assume that Polanski, who did the impossible, got a bad performance from Jody Foster, is to blame for the bad timing and lack of funny. I am guessing he did not trust his actors and didn't really get the material, particularly the American characters. Just for one example, did he ever hear the expression passive aggressive?Oh well, what a missed opportunity."
2,Cliche Typecasting,Imagine the most intense 5 minutes of a Woody Allen or Ingmar Bergman movie sustained 90 minutes. I understand the original play dictated the dialogue. But even the two calmer characters were forced into nonstop staccato ping-pong delivery. This material begs for pregnant pauses to breathe and apparently the actors and editor were not allowed to provide them.
3,"I couldn't escape the ""Carnage"" either...","Between the words ""razor-sharp"" and ""comedy"" the words ""VERY DARK"" should be included in the description of this film. The acting is generally terrific but I was all set for a comedy and found myself being brought down so thoroughly that I started thinking about all the ways Harold tried to kill himself before meeting Maude...NOT a ""light"" topic at all; each person brought enough baggage to overflow the room on the screen, as well as the room where I sat observing the massacre...if you're happy, and you know it, and you want to change that about you,watch this film!"
3,quality of the DVD itself,"Even though I bought it wrapped, brand-new and direct from amazon, the DVD itself is definitely of second-rate quality. It skips and gets stuck at times. I have 3 different players and each showed the same poor quality. It looks like a copy of a copy of a copy. It is a pity, because there are so many details that are essential to the movie and are meant to be visual and tangible to the plot. Perhaps a better copy will be released in the future."
5,Loved it.,"If you don't like arthouse ""talky"" films (the French are very good at this--especially Eric Rohmer) then I advise you to stay as far away as you can from CARNAGE. However, if you enjoy people talking about everyday things and slowly revealing their repressed inner souls--then go see this film! I think it's one of the best films I have seen in 2011 and that includes SOURCE CODE, MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, MONEYBALL, THE DESCENDANTS, BRIDESMAIDS, WAR HORSE, THE SEPARATION, IDES OF MARCH, and TREE OF LIFE."
2,not razor sharp,I expected so much more...this was not razor sharp.It ended up being dull and typical. You already know what to expect.As a play on stage I think it would be much more interesting and physical work for actors!
3,Video quality poor,I was surprised that the video quality was fuzzy and poor. It was disappointing especially since we purchased the video from Amazon instead of renting it. I expected a better quality picture from Amazon.
3,Carnage,"Here's a recipe for tension: put Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly, Christoph Waltz, and Kate Winslet in a room, add a pinch of disagreement, simmer, and serve. Roman Polanski's Carnage sticks to those particulars throughout its 80-minute runtime, and though I found it a bit too stage-bound to truly take flight as a film, I simply enjoyed watching these four fine actors rip each other to shreds. A pair of married couples meets for a polite chat after a playground dispute between their respective children. However, it isn't long before any veneer of civility is stripped away, and the situation devolves into an out-and-out cage match of verbal sparring and bitterness. It isn't as compelling on the screen as it was on the stage, but Carnage makes up for its flaws with Polanski's smooth direction and assured performances from Winslet and Foster."
2,Stilted,"The premise of this movie is good: one eleven year old boy whacks another with a stick during an argument and the parents discuss it to try and enlighten the boys about what's right (at least that's what one mom wants). Despite an impressive cast, however, the conversation and movie is unrealistic and stagey. The characters seem implausible and one inconsistent. Like always, Kate Winslet is awfully nice to look at and there is something there, so not a total loss, but definitely not a recommendation."
3,"It's OK, not great",I use this with a Nikon SB800. The light is a bit tough to control and hard to get the look I am looking for. I think a softbox with a dedicated monolight wold work much better. It's inexpensive though and you can get OK results. I am sure some of this might be inexperience with the SB800 on my part.
2,Single ply,"I almost bought this item because it seemed like a good price. I had to enlarge the image and take out my magnifying glass to see that it is only single ply. One or two ply should be mentioned in the description. At this time, all the types of Cottonelle offered are single ply. Call me spoiled, but I won't be a customer until that changes."
5,Please! A review of tissue paper?,"Well, I don't care what you think! I'm glad to have Amazon ship this bulky product to my doorstep instead of schlepping it home from the supermarket weekly.It's a nice brand at a good price. Buy a couple of month's worth at a time; save your back. Leave space in your grocery bag for food!"
4,A very funny Christmas DVD,Larry the Cable Guy's Star Studded Christmas Extravaganza is very funny. I love Larry the Cable Guy. I'm so glad that I pre-ordered this DVD.
1,WHAT AN IDIOT,"That kinda crap? What are you people thinking?? The Cat in the Hat Motion Picture Soundtrack?? sheesh... For one, this Cat in the Hat's a complete disaster! and for two, they've recently made an excellent Cat in the Hat cartoon in 1994, and I found it a perfect cartoon. to whomever disagrees and loves this piece of mindless bullshi*, find something more constructive to do."
4,very good condition.,this is a product that you will find very enthusiastic due to all the explanations needed and the the real origin of many grapes.
4,Great Lacrosse Movie,Great movie. Sticks to the tradition of lacrosse.Watched with some players and kids - all liked it. Would recommend to others.
3,Enjoyed,I enjoyed learning about the history. The acting was not the greatest but the storyline was okay. I asked I would recommend it.
1,Had potential but they blew it,"This story had the potential to be excellant. It was amateurishly done. The acting was horrible and the story so stereotypic I almost expected to hear "" we gottem land you givem wampum""."
5,Great Movie!,"Living within Western New York, Lacrosse is a HUGE sport. This movie has everything that a viewer wants, I could have done without the story line due to my love for the actual game. There are quite a few greats in this movie! Go Iroquois Nationals and the Buffalo Bandits!"
5,Great family movie!,"I saw this movie in the theater during its limited release. What a fun film! This is the type of movie that you can enjoy with your whole family. It's a great story that needed to be told. It's a story that inspires you to truly care about your roots, your community and your family. The cast is great, especially Brandon Routh (Joe Logan), Gil Birmingham (Ben Logan) and Chelsea Ricketts. The score is also great, and a must buy for music lovers like me. If you like sports movies with heart and a positive message, check this out!"
4,Lacrosse excitement,"Great family movie, wonderful story about a great sport and it's origins. Highly recommended, for all sports enthusiast. First movie about lacrosse"
4,Great LAX team builder!,"Watched this with the whole family, but my son, in particular, was excited as he is on his second LAX season and has fallen in love with the game. As a parent, I thought the movie not only highlighted the importance of team with LAX (and many other sports), but also provided insight to the sport that is otherwise overlooked.Great movie - will watch again and again."
5,Amazing Movie!!!,This movie was a amazing! My daughter just started lax last year and has been very interested in the history of lax. This movie was both informative and entertaining. Now because of the movie her brother wants to switch from Baseball to Lax as well. Great family time movie.
4,decent movie,"A bit campy, but I love lacrosse and this actually did a pretty good job showing players with skill. Wish they would have taken some of the extra stuff out"
5,Loved the show,I love this movie. It deals with life of Indians in a current world. It deals with a great sport that many people are unaware of. I cannot say enough about it other then I am going to order a copy for a grandson who is interested in playing the sport
3,Where are the actors?,"The sports plays were brilliantly choreographed, directed and executed. I commend the Lacrosse players for their skill and acting. The sports scenes were quite believable. But the rest of the cast... I wasn't expecting Oscar nominees, but the acting quality didn't score any points with me at all. Buy this movie for the Lacrosse!"
3,GOOD MOVIE,If you like lacrosse...you will like this movie. The plot was interesting enough and the acting was decent. Good story line.
3,At least it's lacrosse.,"Low budget, predictable movie, but considering how few lacrosse movies get made, we enjoyed watching it. Good action shots and realistic moves."
4,Good but could have been better.,"I saw this movie in its limited release in the theatre because my son plays lacrosse. As this is not a subject which is highly portrayed in movies we both went with high hopes. The best part of this movie is how it shows the importance of the sport of lacrosse in the Native American culture, the worst part is the over-all plot of the story which is highly predictable. If you are a lacrosse player you should probably buy it (in particular if you know nothing about the sports' background). If you want a movie which is more entertaining, purchase ""Warrior's Heart"" which touches the same subject matter to some degree. If you want a very interesting dvd dealing with lacrosse, purchase the ""Morgan Lacrosse"" documentary ( very good true story)."
5,Crooked Arrows,Awesome movie that deals with a Native American male who has lost his way from his people and how he finds his way back by helping his people in the end. It also brings historical information about the true beginnings of La Crosse. So much of Native American history has been Americanized and taken away from the Native people. This movie helps to re-identify that there are a people who were here first and their ways have been incorporated to help make America what it is today.
4,"blues, funk and soul","James Armstrong's CD Sleeping with a Stranger combines blues,funk and soul in an appealing way. Mr. Armstrong is a gifted musician and it is a pleasure to see and hear his guitar work. He is also a skilled songwriter judging fromhis work on this cd. I am quite fond of Baby's Catwalkin'.I would expect James Armstrong to become a recognized musician among today's blues artists."
3,Good book for entry level flash cartoonists,"Flash 5 Cartooning is a good book for beginning flash cartoonists. I recommend getting this book from the Amazon.com used book marketplace in order to get more bang for your buck. Once you have a grip on Flash Cartooning, you may want to start creating some flash games.I also recommend and have the following books:""How to Cheat in Flash CS3"" by Chris Georgenes, ""Cartooning: Animation 1 with Preston Blair (HT26)"", ""The Big Book of Cartooning"", ""Dreamweaver MX / Fireworks MX Savvy"", ""Flash MX Savvy"", ""Flash 5 Bible"" and ""Macromedia Flash 5 ActionScript for Fun and Games"". The ""Flash 5 Bible"" has a small section on cartoon animation."
2,A somewhat helpful book,"I'm sorry but I didn't achieve the goal for my cartoon with this book. I get frustrated easliy and this book being a partial culprit. Sure, I learned a little actionscript. But I recommend the The Art of Flash Cartooning over this one. There are also free online sources that will provide some very important instruction on staging and layout which this book covers briefly(Staging is too important to have a brief walkthrough) The CD gave me the urls to some cool sites and some cartoons to watch other than that this book isn't of much use to a flash animators, particularly beginners. In order to do something it is best to do it right the first time or not at all."
2,A Beginners Guide,"I should have listened to one of the above reviews, entitled ""This book was written by a beginner"".If you never done animation and never used Flash, then this book is your new best friend. If you've used Flash, you can skip the beginning chapters. If you've ever done any animation before, don't buy the book.Compared to other Flash books and material out there, this book doesn't hold up. The author's own work is only average at best, as he ever states in the intro. ""...I'm not the best, not ever ranked"". For anyone with experience, this just isn't the book you're looking for."
1,Another geek who thinks he can draw!,It's high time some real animators wrote a book about Flash animation. The same people who have been polluting the net with their useless Flash films are now going into print.Don't waste your money....completely hopeless.
3,Dumb ways to turn a great book bad....,"My niece (7) and nephew (13) wanted to see what you could do with this book, so I pulled out the CD and started running the animations for them. I was embarrassed that profanity was unnecessarily used in one of the first animations I showed them. It was the dope smoking sheep that put the book over the edge. While it was funning to me, I am now no longer allowed to show animations that I have not previously previewed to my niece and nephew. I didn't expect that I'd have to pre-screen the content of a Flash book on cartooning before showing it to kids.As to the book, it is shelved away until my wife forgives me for what I have shown my niece and nephew...."
5,Want to be a Flash Cartoonist? BUY THIS BOOK!!,"WOW!!I had come to that strangest of life decisions, to become a Flash 5 Cartoonist. I looked up on Amazon for books related to this, and I found this book, just like you are doing right now!Within a month I had not only learned Flash 5,but had learned crucial lessons about cartooning itself!It is so fulfilling making cartoons/movies using Flash.Flash 5 gives you the power to make art, and Flash 5 Cartooning teaches you how!I especially enjoyed the specific chapters in the book.The chapters about watching and writing cartoons are very helpful for me. This book is more useful everyday!Mark Clarkson is a wonderful teacher for all the young padawan Flashers out there. Mark clues you in to all the tricks of the Flash cartooning trade!He even provides you with earnest advice about selling your art!Mark Clarkson put heart into this book and it shows.His genius will be proven by future generations of Flashing Americans. THANKYOU Mark Clarkson! You rock!"
4,Great for a beginner.,"As someone who has quite a bit of experience with animation programs, but little exposure to Flash, I found this book to be very useful. It's written in a lively, entertaining manner and Mark Clarkson manages to describe difficult procedures in terms even those new to Flash can understand."
5,Definitely recommended for beginners to Flash Cartooning.,"This is excellent book, I'm still working with it now, and it's going much smoother than I expected. I was a bit leery about buying the book at first, because I had bought a competitor's book first (Art of Cartooning in Flash). I was really disappointed with that one. This book however is great. I've only been working with it for two days and I already did my first bit of real character animation (Chapter 8's Stickman). I didn't expect to pick Flash up so quickly. Brilliant writing, Mark Clarkson."
5,An Amazing Life Story,"A wonderful and easy read. For those interested in the Civil War, and particularly naval action, this book is a MUST read. It is difficult to accept that the author came into such close contact with so many CSA leaders, as well as having second meetings with those he met years before. However, there is no reason to disbelieve him and reading about first hand encounters with Jefferson Davis and many other Southern leaders is very helpful in understanding the reasons for this terrible American tragedy.His life includes attending the Naval Academy aboard the USS Constitution; months at sea on a sailing steamer raider, numerous boardings and sinking of US merchant ships, encounters with Moroccan desert cave dwellers, moving in high social circles, hunting kangaroo in Australia, and more.A spine tingling tale."
1,I used to be a fan of twista...,"Untill he made the mistake of signing with cocka-fella. I mean i had almost all his cds before he went to that gay lebal. First of all, i mean, atleast if his album was a bit decent then maiby i would not be so letdown but twista's ""kamikaze"" basically sounds like he was trying to sound like ja-rule and have all those r&b queer songs. All the songs are wack and even for an r&b album? It's pretty horrible. Dont waste your hard earned money. Peace !!"
1,Mainstream,"This is the last straw. Twista cant rap for gods sake, he says a trillion words per second with no rational meaning wat so ever. 99% of the rappers on MTV nowadays cant rap for their life. Why did my favorite music genre have to have gone mainstream? Rap is just the next disco or funk, notice how nobody likes those anymore becuase pop culture ruined them for people who liked it. ANYONE who owns a Murphy Lee, Nelly, 50 Cent, Ja rule, Chingy, Lil anybody or w/e is not a hip hop fan but a mainstream loving loser who doesnt know hip hop at all and is just trying to like what everybody else likes so they can pretend to be cool or ghetto. Go home MTV and BET and give us back the hip hop we know and love. Support the underground real hip hop heads and ban the fruity mainstream."
5,Most underrated album ever made,"I don't usually rate albums if I feel I don't need to or if everything has already been said. But this is the most underrated album I've ever heard. I first listened to it when it came out and I couldn't stop listening to it. Literally for months straight, I didn't listen to one other album. It has an insane amount of replay value and never gets old. I still listen to it today. There isn't one song on this album I skip or dislike in the slightest. I felt I had to write this review because I don't see one reviewer that seems to like the album as much I do."
3,kamikaze,"the long awaited album is a must have, this album has a variety of slow songs mixed with fast. however it didn't have the kick that i thought it would have and after listening to the cd a few times it does get overplayed and boring"
2,What happened to the old Twista?,"i have been reading the reviews of this CD over the past couple of days and i cant believe how many people say this CD is the best album of the year. IF you are a true twista fan, and have been listening to him since Adrenaline Rush, over even his Legit Balla CD's you would understand what Twista is truly about, not this so-called album of the year CD. To me this CD is crap, with a few good songs, but the rest is unbelieveable. There is not one guest apperence by any of the Legit Baller family, and twista raps about clubbing and women through-out this whole CD. If you want to hear a real twista CD go get Adrenaline Rush, or Mobstability where Twista is at his best."
2,Not a hit,"I used to like Twista, but this album is very disappointing. That is because is was produces by Kanye West. I dont like Kanye West's music. He should have stayed with the folks who produced Adrenaline Rush. This album kinda sucks."
5,Twista Is Doin' The Thang!,"Slow Jamz was my most favorite song in the whole rap and r&b world. When I got the CD, I could not stop listenin' to it. Twista is doin' the thang fo' real. TWISTA IS OFF THE HEEZEY FO SHEEZY. Cop this album if you like Twista, Do or Die and Bone Thugs."
1,Standing up for black Americans,"I was disappointed with the track ""Slow Jamz"" which states ""got a black skinned friend, looks like Michael Jackson. Got a white skinned friend looks like Michael Jackson."" When black Americans were dying in New Orleans, Michael Jackson started to take action but what did Twista do about it? What did Kanye West do about it? Michael Jackson cleared the way for black artists who can now appear on MTV, thanks to Michael Jackson. Twista should show more respect."
4,Worth the wait,"Waiting on the follow-up to ""Adrenaline Rush,"" listeners will appreciate Twista taking his time. Cuts like ""Get Me"" and ""Kill Us All"" show he hasn't lost his hunger, and he certainly hasn't lost his gift for spitting vicious rhymes at Ferrari-like speeds. Obviously, his alliance with the Roc is helping his push, with the lead single ""Slow Jamz"" and arguably the gem of the album, ""Overnight Celebrity"", with fellow Chi-Town star Kanye West contributing on both songs. He also get creative on the playalistic ""Drinks"" in which he likens the ladies to his favorite liquid potions. He even gets personal on ""Hope,"" which shows the motor-mouth murderer pondering the world around him. A couple of cuts seems a little trivial like ""Like a 24"", and the Roc-A-Fellas posse cut ""Art and Life"" is average at best, but not enough to hurt the album. It's a great buy, and puts Twista back in the best of the pack, ""Kamikaze""-style."
5,TWISTA,"This album is definetly one of my all time favorites. I like that he raps really fast I don't like slow rappers as much. I think his lyrics are great and it is amazing how he raps them so fast and so clearly. My favorite tracks are kill us all, higher featuring Ludacris, and hope. This album is a must have!"
1,what f*ck happen ?,"Mann, im pissed at diz sh*t. Wtf, happen to twista ? Why he had to sign with rocka wear and turn gay ? F*cking sell out! I have twista's early cds and do or die and those are classics but kamikaze is just plain horrible and pure r & b insted of the rawness he used to have and its just pathetic and dumb! No song here is good and no he's no longer fast like before so it realy f*cking sucks like sh*t. Yo, get his other works and skip diz one maynn! F*ck twista and his sell out fa**ot self.. Traiter!!"
2,Come on Twista,"Twista, I know that ""Get it Wet"" was a big success, but the fellas don't need a whole album of ""Ja Rule"" type tracks. I got love for you and all, but I was expecting another ""Adrenaline Rush"" or harder after seven years. The highlights were ""Get Me"" ""Kill Us All"" and ""Roll Like a 24."" It's nothing wrong with loving the ladies, but can we get some ""Overdose"" type music."
2,All the wait for .... Nothing,"This album is good for the candy hip pop loving masses .. But if your a real Twista fan (like myself) this album should disappoint .. His flow is softer his brash lyrics are gone to the waste side also for the 50 Cent, Ja Rule type of sales .. Not to say this album stinks .. but if you followed Twista compare his other albumS and see the ugly difference .. A bright spot of this album that gave me hope was the second song ""Kill Us All"" the old Twista sound! ... IF YOU MUST HAVE THIS CANDY COATED CRAP DOWNLOAD IT."
3,OK...........,Twista is one of the mc's bussin out of chicago.....But on this effort it's like every song sounds the same to me....lol...probably cause 90% of the cd was produced by Jazzy Pha....nice effort though..the cd isn't bad....i'd give the lyrical content about a 6/10...check out some of twista's earlier work...
4,Twista gone mainstream.,"Twista samples alot of songs on this album. But, hey I guess he has to because they way he raps it would get old really fast. Not a classic but I'm glad he is starting to discover himself as an artist, look forward to see the next album.Best Tracks(Beside Slow Jamz):Overnight Celebrity.Sunshine"
3,Eh,"To be brief and honest, Twista lost his sense of storytellin'. With ""Kamikaze"", you'll notice that none of his songs tell a story or take you on a ride. Yea, he can rap fast, but he cant play wit peoples emotions like the greats could, 2Pac and Biggie, Dre, all them. It's not a bad album, but i wouldnt recommend it if you are into the kinda rap i mentioned before like 2pac and BIG. But if ur in it for insanely good speed rap, or just sumthin to laugh about, pick it up. Adrenaline Rush was much better, but this isnt a bad cd at all."
2,Twista-Go back 2 tha Adreneline Rush days,i wuz very disappointed hearin thys album.thys cant hold a candle 2 tha underground classis Adreneline Rush album.my expectations were higher for thys album.what i suggest twista should do is re-release adreneline rush 2 tha mainstream.this album is o.k. but could have been better.
3,Review of Twista's Kamikaze,"Twista started his career in 1997 with his debut album entitledAdrenaline Rush, then returned in 1998 with Mobstability(his sophomore album), then in 1999 with Legit Ballin I, then in 2001 with Legit Ballin II, and then in 2004 with Kamikaze(which deserves 3.5 stars.) By 2004 Kamikaze is his best released album yet.*I will rate the following tracks on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the best.*1. Get Me - 8/102. Kill Us All - 8.5/103. Pimp On - 7.5/104. Slow Jamz - 10/105. Get That Doe (Ain't It Man) - 7/106. Still Feels So Good - 7/107. Drinks - 7/108. Badunkadunk - 7.5/109. One Last Time - 7.5/1010. Shows Over - 7/1011. Higher - 8/1012. Snoopin - 7.5/1013. Like a 24 - 8.5/1014. Hope - 8.5/1015. Lovely Day - 8.5/1016. Art and Life - 8/10~If you've liked Twista in the past then don't doubt him on this album and go get it.~"
2,Kamikaze by Twista,"Chicago native Twista returns with his latest record and his first with Roc A Fella records, Kamikaze. While is wicked fast tongue sets him apart from all the other emcees, to listen to it for an entire album is asking way to much. In fact, he sounds most at home on slower tracks such as ""Slow Jamz"" with Kanye West & Jamie Foxx & ""Sunshine"" with Anthony Hamilton, where he still insists on his trademark rapid delivery. Its worth checking out for appearences by Ludacris, R. Kelly & Cee-Lo, but I'd much rather wait to hear him guesting on other people's songs then listen to a full length record of his own material."
3,could have been better,"this album was good but there should have been more hardcore tracks like kill us all there should have been way more joints like that. Way too many love songs and party tracks e.g, slow jamz, so sexy, drinks, like a 24. track # 2 was the best one on here. followed up by one last time. also the last three tracks sag on this album just like on infamy."
3,"yes, we all know he's NOT the fastest ever!","but it's a refreshing change to hear a fast peaced mc in the mainstream, but after a few songs, it's apparent that he's changed his sytle (a good thing) to emcee at normal speeds on most tracks. However, when this happens, you can see Twista's about the usual game ""clothes, hoes, and rankrolls"" and he comes across as a mediocre emcee on top of great production.Even when he's rapping fast, he still doesn't include very many rhymes...recommended download!peace,"
4,DIS THANG IZ OFF DA HOOK,"TWISTA'S CD IZ TIGHT, IT WAS WORTH THE 9$ I SPENT ON IT. MY FAVORITE SONG WAS HOPEFUL UNTIL I STARTED LISTEING TO SNOOPIN'.. THE WHOLE CD IS TIGHT. HE DID HIS THANG ON DIS ONE!"
5,Chi - Town at its finest,"First of all, Twista is unbelievable. To rap as fast and as unike as him it overrides any wack beats or lyrics. But in this album his beats are sick. All of the tracks are insane. If youre gonna kick it with the ladies drop this LP. I love this album so much that after a week of listening to it it was all scratched up. My favorite tracks are: Kill Us All, Slow Jamz, Still Feels So Good, Badunkadunk, and Sunshine. This is the best you can get for your money. Buy it TODAY!"
5,YES! IT CAME!,"I have been waiting 7 long years for Twista to come out with a new album. 7 painful years. Now that it has finally come I am not dissapointed at all. The fastest rapper in the world still has it. On this album there is a variety of songs like So Sexy to Kill Us All. Both are great. The best songs on the album are the hit single Slow Jamz, Higher, So Sexy, Kill Us All, and Like a 24. Go pick this album up. And Twista please don't wait another 7 years before you realease another album."
2,2-2.5,"""slow Jamz"" works&is catchy. Kayne West Production works there but Hit&Miss on the other stuff He has on here. R.Kelly hits another Home run with ""So Sexy"" featuring JS who sing&sound alot like Janet Jackson on there Background parts. Twista has a Dj Quik vibe with a Sugga Free attack on certain cuts.I think the Album suffers from a few to many guests.Twista got Skills but He is often Burried behind His own flow on alot of this set."
3,Might as well join the R.O.C,"c mon twista your killing me, dont get me wrong there are good songs on this cd about 5 or so, but twista is taking the same route as everybody else rapping about females money and what kind of stuff he got,but hey anything to get played on mtv and get a bunch of 12 year old girls to buy it, im not saying i hate this cd i was just expecting more out of it, and i probally wont cop the next one..."
4,OFF DA HEEZY,"FROM DA LAND OF ALL DA BALLAS AND GANGZTAS, I CAN SAY TWISTAS MARK IS BEING FELT IN BAYSIDE... THE FIRST FOUR TRACKS ARE THE HIGHLIZZLE OF THE ALBIZZLE... I ALSO ENJOY EVERYTHING BUT THE R. KEEZE SONG... THAT ONE ISN'T SO HOT... BUT IT'S DEF BANGIN... PEEEEEZ"
1,Not worth the money,"This rerelease of ""Kamikaze"" is a way for Twista to make more money. I'm not paying 15 bucks just for 2 extra tracks. That is so not worth the money. I already own the original version. If I were you, I'd just buy the 2 extra songs through legal music download websites."
2,GO GET THA OLD TWISTA,After listening to all theze new whack rapperz playin in the radio station that plays rap crap....i thought maybe twista will get some good muzik on the cd...this album is an embarrassment.....i gave thiz cd 2 stars because i really like twista back in the day...especially adrenaline rush...(go get that album instead)....he shows too much heart to thiz album...therez too much love songz and i cant stand him no more....thiz guy got talent but the beats n the music just soundz too fruity for me....i wish twista goes back in the old dayz....man there is no good album in 2004...rap iz dead n i think thiz cd is R&B
2,Item in picture is not correct.,"The item shipped to me has a side hinge and a big protruding button where a clip attaches. If you are looking for an adequate case this will be it. But if you want something that won't snag your clothing, keep looking and pay a little more.I wish the case was as pictured in the photo."
1,"Shoot yourself, you will have made a smarter move",I'm serious. Buying this book is a total waste of time. He's an arrogant jerk who attributes his success to his lack of charm and intelligence. Even a stopped clock is correct twice a day.
4,My new favorite book,"This book has worked a dozen times for me already. I have picked up more single women with this book than with all of my other pick-up line books combined. This book has not only led to better sex, it has also helped me immeasurably in job interviews, interrogations, and general awkward silences. Since buying this book my stutter has bothered me less and I smile all the time. This book is not just for men, even a shy girl like me can get a little lovin carrying the new Sex Bible around with her. I pull it out and use it where ever I am, bars, airports, bathrooms- the lines are universal. Mr. Max is a pioneer of the pick up line and I hope I can thank him personally someday. Move over L. Ron, Tucker Max is here to stay."
1,Waste of Time,"Do yourself a favor and skip this title. It is nothing you can't find on 1000s of web sites about pickup lines. The guy who wrote this book obviously has no experience being successful with women.I mean when is THIS line going to work -- ""Can I buy you a drink or should I just give you the money?""Please."
1,Crude and moronic,This book is full of lines best delivered by an arrogant jerk who has the maturity of an 11 year-old. Most frightening is that there are other people who profess to actually find this funny. The world is a scary place. Don't waste your money.
2,not worth it,"While I am a big fan of his website and stories, the stuff in this book is pure crap. Half of ""his"" lines are old lines I have heard used a dozen times. A couple of them are adaptations of jokes that are from the 2nd grade -- and weren't even funny then. Personally I think this is very out of character for Tucker. A real letdown.I didn't crack a smile the whole time."
1,SOOOOO CLICHE,"There is nothing different, or special, or even slightly amusing about this book. It's just like 2000 other books out there on the subject of dating that think they're amusing. Don't bother buying this - it was boring, tedious, and dry at best. I should have known it was going to suck as soon as the author said he's still single. .... Maybe you need to get some new pick-up lines!"
4,very funny!,"I went to college with Tucker and I can only assume that he wrote this book in an attempt to help out his fellow U of C students who think that ""Do you have the Stat 220 homework?"" is a risque pick-up line. For the most part, the book is amusing, and perhaps even successful for some. I wouldn't take it too seriously, since I've seen Tucker in action."
5,very good,I grew up with my father watching the lone ranger every week. it was really good \I\work in a nursing home and took it to work for my resident to watch and they loved it
4,Gift,"My mom said that her boyfriend would really like this so I purchased it for his Birthday, boy was that a good choice he watches it just about every day."
4,Nearly perfect,"I love this set but hate that part of the openings is missing where the narrator says, ""With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains, led the fight for law and order in the early west. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. The Lone Ranger rides again!""Also, the close up of the LR rearing up at the rock, the insert shot, doesn't fit and I don't remember it being there. Many of the episodes are time sped, but having said all that, it is clear that the producers of this set took great care in remastering and adding extras and I for one appreciate their effots. Any LR fan will be happy to have this, despite its imperfections."
5,Wow!,"As a little boy of 7 I watched The Long Ranger and longed to be him. He gave me and many of my era a sense of patriotism, hard work, service to our nation, a sense of fair play and admiration for our nation. All I can say is Wow and Wow again. Every cd, all 12 are jamped full of the Long Ranger, full length just like it was 60 years ago or more. The actors are gone, but the value still remains. There is no politcally correct to worry about. Good was good and bad was bad, how can it be anything other? What I did not expect in the collectors item was a picture of The Long Ranger signed by Clayton Moore, obviously just recopied, but what a thrill. Also, a copy of ""The Long Ranger Victory Corp"" complete with a picture of Webbers Bread, long gone. Also a post card address to ""The Long Ranger c/o Meita Bakers ATlanta, Georgia "" incidently it has a place for a 1 cent stamp. Aslo, it reminds us to keep listening to the Long Ranger on radio, i wish I could. All I can say is hi-ho silver."
5,Worth Every Dime,"For a fan of this TV show, this DVD package is the works. So much quality and care went into this offering. From the DVD holders, to the booklet tracing the history of the character (not just of the show) to small collector's packet of memorabilia. The quality of the video transfer is the best of this show you are going to find anywhere. They've done a top job at creating a DVD package of Season One and Season Two, with extras. Every classic TV show DVD released should get this treatment. This collection, for me, even though it's a bit pricey, was worth every dime."
3,Okay,"I haven't been using this textbook very long, but there is one issue I think people might want to be aware of. If you buy this book used, you can't get access to the website. Mine didn't come with the CD-ROM either, but that's more to do with the person who sold it back than anything else (although if the CD-ROM were packaged so that you could just slip it into a pocket on the back cover more people might return the CD with the book). You can buy access to the website for $22/yr."
3,Pretty colorful photos and good CD rom for extra effect,"Overall, the book was well-written. I really enjoyed the color photos and the review questions at the end of the chapters was pretty good.Also included was a CD-rom with the answers to the problems, iActivities to help us digest the chapters we read, and chapter quizzes.I really enjoyed the chapter quizzes because they helped me focus on areas I was fuzzy about. However, I did not like the quizzes very much either, because there were wrong answers. Most of the time, I figured the answer it said was ""correct"" was wrong and vice versa, so if the problems with the CD can be cleared, this can be a great book."
2,Could be better; could be worse,"I haven't surveyed the entire landscape of genetics textbooks, but in general this one still left me lacking. My largest complaint: even though this is a first edition, the editing was atrocious."
4,Entertainment?,"The book is great for genetics though I haven't read many other genetics books. The CD is a great addition, it gives real life scenario activities for what you are studying in each chapter, I wish they had it for organic. Description and pictures are great in coveying the general concepts of Genetics. Enjoy!"
4,Good product for a good price.....,"I like to go with OEM parts when I can and if the price is not way out of line. From my experience OEM parts seem to fit better and are easier to install than a lot of aftermarket parts, although not all.This filter came with a better gasket than the Wix (a brand I trust) filter from my local auto parts. The price difference was a bit more but, for the better gasket it was worth it to me and Amazon had it for a good price.It was packaged very well from ACDelco. The gasket was sealed flat instead of folded in a box like a lot of others."
1,Good fit but....,"Although this fits very nicely on my Pearl, I, for the life of me, could not remove the cover easily.My phone was acting slow, so I wanted to remove the battery for a minute and put it back in. That means I had to remove the cover, and I pulled and pulled, cut my skin, and left a imprint on my fingers because I struggled so hard to take it off.The second part of the battle was putting it back on! Because it's such a ""perfect"" fit, it took my dad and I another 8 minutes to squeeze the phone into this and zip it up properly.Unless you never plan on taking out your battery or sim card, then this is perfect, it really does become part of the phone. But if you ever need to remove anything in a moments notice, make sure you alot 10 minutes and wear gloves because you're in for a fight! This was NOT worth the price!"
5,An Excellent Case,"I decided that I needed a case for my Blackberry Pearl that could stand up to some punishment. After a bit of looking around I decided on this one, made of leather and tough plastic.I had never owned or known anyone with a Krussel brand case before, but I decided to take a chance, and I am thoroughly pleased with this one. It is extremely durable and has protected my Blackberry (and its screen) from numerous falls, bumps, and scratches.All in all, it is an excellent case, and would recommend it, and the brand to anyone."
5,Great item,"I really wanted a case to protect the screen and didn't want to use a stick-on protector because of past bad luck with them. The case fit perfectly and was very thin compared to other cases I looked at. I did remove the back clip (which was sewn-on leather, so I used a seam ripper) because of its bulkiness, because it covered the camera opening, and because I would not use the clip. The removal caused no damage to the case, and it looks great as ever. This product gets 5 stars because of the classiness of the soft black leather, the slimness of the case, and the protection that it provides, as well as the good price."
2,Poor quality,"I was disappointed with this case, especially since it got so many positive reviews.Two major problems:1) The case that I received didn't fit perfectly. There was a little bit of slack in the clear vinyl front.2) After a few weeks, the removable belt clip broke. There is a very frail piece of plastic that locks the belt clip in place to the case which broke without me yanking on it or anything like that."
4,Great Product - Perfect Fit,"i have had this case for about a month now and its great. it fits perfectly, tight fit so your phone doesnt move, and its protected my phone really well so far from dropping it to things hitting it and whatevers in my pocket at the time.the only downside is that you have to unbutton the back piece and hold it down to take a picture, but its really not that bad."
4,Good case for people who work in a dirty environment.,"The case fits well and protects the screen and keys from dirt and debris. It does not however protect the trackball which is still exposed. Only complaint is that the plastic over the keys makes typing a little more difficult than without it, so if you don't need to protect the phone from dirt or grease I recommend getting a case with open keys."
4,Krusell BB Pearl Case,Very nice case that covers screen and allows free access to all other input/output interfaces. Can't beat for the price!
4,blackberry case,the krusell classic case for blackberry pearl is great. It is an excellent fit and it protects the phone.
1,Krusell case for Blackberry Pearl,"Please do not buy this case. I am very disappointed because Krusell usually makes a good quality case. The case does not fit properly. They made this case too small and is very difficult to install. Once installed the side buttons and covered, not aligned properly. Do not buy this case. I'm trying to return it for a refund."
4,Accepting new concepts of reality,"I thought that this book was very interesting. I would also recommend ""The Science of G-d"" by Israeli physicist Gerrard Shroeder. I am constantly surprised by the number of individuals that seem threatened by different concepts of reality. I am an environmental scientist and not a physicist, but I keep up with many of the current trends in physics. Considering the fact that it has been proven multiple times in reputable physics labs that reality can be affected by consciousness. I didn't feel this book was a big leap. Anyone that studies up on laboratory experiments involving photons and observation would be doing a disservice to science by not at least acknowledging that the mind can exist on levels beyond physical synapses.How else could physical observation by an intelligent mind effect the ultimate outcome of any individual photon?"
4,A Good CD,"Johnny Rodriguez has one of the finest voices in Country Music, and although this album was released nearly 10 yrs ago, it's the latest collection we have from him! Personally, I prefer the early-'70's sound that he provided; this CD, while good, is more reflective of his later '70's-early 80's sound. But, there are a few songs here that harken back to Johnny's traditional country sound, which makes this a must-have album. The best number here is ""Corpus Christi Bay"", a true redneck reminiscing song if there ever was one....noone could pull this number off except Johnny. Other notable mentions are: ""Big Red Sun Blues"", ""Every Night About this Time"", and ""When it's Your Turn To Fall"". Although modern ""Country"" Music has reverted to a Boy-Band, Pop-sound, I hope Johnny Rodriguez will put out another album soon. And, if it's half as good as this one, I'll be the first in line to buy it."
2,Hard to watch...,"I love The Flaming Lips, and this film wouldn't be hard to watch if it were shorter. The scenes where the characters were just walking in silence I sped up and enjoyed the film as I wondered ""what is the point?"" But in the end there seems to be a point. Watch it. Rate it."
2,"2 good parts, mostly not","I liked the innovative spaceship parking job (definitely the highlight of the film), and the initial color swirl thing. But the dialog was slow and repetitive, and the acting was terrible."
5,the most fabulous singer!!,"Della Reese is the ultimate performer.Her voice is beyond description:amazingly powerful,expressive with flawless elocution and most original articulation,that requires much taste to be appreciated by real connoissers!Each song is a unique composition and none is like the other.After you listened to Della,the other blues or jazz stars seem colourless,despite their own qualities,they all are outcasted by Della's incredible temperament and talent.She is the alpha and the omega of song:she can sing everything,from gospel,blues to jazz and even classical music!!Della reese is without contest the BEST singer in the world!She has the trumpets of Jericho in her voice,and sings like an angel!She makes songs alive,she is not only an entertainer (actually the best) but she delivers a message in singing,of life,passion and joy.She is true and authentic and once you heard her,she put a spell on you forever!Moreover,she is gorgeous,and charismatic!Della Reese is the ultimate diva!"
4,Does exactly what I needed.,"I got this arm band because I like to run, walk and bike and I didn't want to be holding my iPod all the time or putting it in my pocket (just in case I didn't have one). Its nothing fancy, it just does exactly what you think you would. It comes with this sleeve that slides onto the band; which is nice because that sleeve can be used without the band so you can protect your iPod all the time. It also comes with a plastic screen cover, but to be honest the stickers on those always confuse me and I never know how to put it on right, so I haven't used it yet. Also, if you have skinny arms (girls you know what I am talking about), the twig skinny arms, this item is probably not going to be the best for you. I don't think it would strap tight enough so it wouldn't fall down while you were using it. All in all, for me, its just what I was looking for."
2,Buyer beware!,"The listing does not say that the sleeve is for a VIDEO Ipod. We have an older Ipod that just stores PICTURES. The video Ipod is smaller than the other, and as such the holes for everything did not line up. We had to cut bigger holes to get it to fit. This seller (Computer Brain), however, was very good to deal with. I would buy from them again."
4,Nice case,"It does the job, quickly put your ipod into the sleeve and onto your arm and your ready to go. Not bad!"
2,No craft projects,I was so disappointed by this book. There are a lot of pretty pictures but hardly any actual craft projects. It's more of a display of the author's and her mother's private Christmas decoration collection. The book gave me one or two ideas but all in all was not worth the money. I regret buying this book.
4,"Nice book to flip through, holiday houses are very cute","I enjoyed looking through this book. Of particular interest to me were the adorable holiday houses. They have about 8 different templates and a lot of photos of them all decorated and displayed quite nicely. Since I ran across them in this book, I have seen more examples of them online, and they are very pretty. I'm planning on making some myself. There aren't many other projects however, hence the loss of a star."
4,A source of inspiration,"I bought this book for crafting ""inspiration"" rather than for craft ""how-to"" or instruction, although it has some of both. It met my expectation & more. It is well photographed & well written."
5,Vintage Christmas Crafts,I had seen the book in the book store. I bought it for a friend. I liked it so well I bought one for myself. Got it cheaper through Amazon.
5,"Great Overview-- and All of ""Looking On,"" Their Best","The Move were sui generis-- nothing before or after remotely like them. Roy Wood, loony genius, wrote most of their stuff, and it's still fresh and fun 35 to 40 years later. Some below maintain that their ""Looking On"" album is somehow weak-- I couldn't disagree more. I'd call it a masterpiece. It's hard to find these days, but appears here in its entirety on CD 3-- I've listened to it hundred of times (just as I did when it first came out in 1970). Buy this set and then track down ""Message From The Country"" and you'll have pretty much all you need. Enjoy!"
2,"A wonderful novel, told in bright terms","If you like novels couched in the intrigue of the cold war in Europe you will find this very exciting. How he gets into that problem and how he gets out provides a particularly entrhalling text. I really like this type of nove.Seems like one always wonders what happens next. Like we all do, we try to anticipate and hope that the next turn goes both his and our way. The book is something like a mystery story with the expected twists and turns but with a lot more. It gives one a chance to assimilate the advance of the story without the confusion, because of too many sub plots.Mr. Lunsford's style of writing is very appealing to me. Somewhat like the old Mike Hammer novels. The Bob Burton Bounty Hunter books. Speculation is not there when he says something. He just spits it out. Some vernacular, colorful words and such.You will not mistake his meaning.If you don't like this book you don't like chicken soup.A new fan of this gentleman."
5,"Excellent lyrics, great vocals, fabulous musicians!","I spent New Year's eve in my neighbor's basement as the privileged guest for a private Tamarack concert. They had been snowed out of their booking and were his houseguests. For over an hour they took us into another world. It is a mystery to me that ""Farther Along"" is not playing on every easy music station. This is a finely crafted CD that you will play over and over and over."
2,Good book but poor quality binding,"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for a young woman. When it arrived, it looked like it was used - the cover was all beat up and the inside binding (front and back) were off kilter from the rest of the book. The book contents looked pretty good though, so I sent back and asked for a replacement. The second one arrived immediately (thank you Amazon!) however, the cover was still slightly damaged and the binding problem was the same. I sent it back and asked for a refund."
5,proper country music !,"this is what country music needs, if you dont like Heather Myles then you ought to stay out of the country section. every track is better then the pervious, no matter how often its played. heather has got a lovely voice that makes her music stand out from the rest. get this cd, you wont regret it !"
2,Plunkett is right,"Plunkett is indeed right. The album was rushed and it sounds like it. The first track has no hook to it, just him repeating the title over and over. Hammerhead is good, but it's no Eruption at all. Get over it is good, but Steve is right, it could've used some polish. Blondes In Black Cars just simply was not what I was expecting when the new Autograph came out. I saw the video and decided NOT to buy it, I think your first single should entice you to buy. I didn't purchase it until it came out on re-issue. It is a good listen, will bring you back to the 80's no doubt. Add this to your metal cheese collection, just don't pay alot for"
5,Excellente!,"Julie Brown is absolutely the best! I love this movie, and I love Madonna too. This is, if not the best, one of the best comedies in the World. You have to see it!"
5,Where is the DVD??,"We have all been patiently waiting for ""Medusa"" to come out on DVD...but our patience is getting thinner than Lindsay Lohan. This needs to come out soon...as does ""Without You I'm Nothing"" by our gal Sandy. Both titles are among the funniest comedic performances in gay culture."
5,Outstanding!!!!!!,I really like it. Everyone should see it. I am going to become Zorro when i grow up.
5,Thoroughly exciting and entertaining!!,"Whenever I have two hours to spare for some spectacular romance, comedy and swashbuckling I'll turn this movie on! Banderas and Hopkins both play Zorro flawlessly. Zeta-Jones makes a stunning Elena. My only disappointment is that Zeta-Jones didn't do more fighting scenes. The one scene she did was great! It was very convincing. The music was perfect! It really enhances the action. I recommend this movie to any one who likes swordplay and romance."
4,It was great but predictable,"It was great but predictable. You know what's gonna happen, but how it's gonna happen kept me at the edge of my seat."
3,They just took too much time getting across the beginning!,This movie was kind of great at the end but the beginning stunk
3,More Buckle Than Swash,"But, all in all, this was an entertaining film. Didn't leave much of an impression, but everybody did their job and it wasn't time wasted. Suitable for anybody over the age of 10."
2,Cross-color artefacts,"This Deluxe Edition DVD has the worst case of cross-color artifact I have seen on any DVD movie so far. It has a ""Mastered in Hi Definition"" sigh on the back of the DVD; well, it may be mastered in high definition, but they obviously used a composite source and a terrible color decoder. This artifact is really very obvious on a big plasma TV, and my DVD player's ""Cross-Color Suppression"" filter could not remove it completely."
3,Great Adventure Movie,"This sucessful rendition of Zorro`s story is a truly convincing and engaging blockbuster, showing the best qualities so rarely seen in action-adventure movies nowadays. Martin Campbell treats the material with care and respect, never dumbing it down into utterly childish stuff and creating an acessible, enrergetic entertainment that satisfies both kids and adults alike.Antonio Banderas plays a credible Zorro, Catherine Zeta-Jones shines as his love interest and Anthony Hopkins is a menacing and adequate antagonist. The action sequences are well-done, being suspenseful and exciting enough and not too forced, overlong or tiresome. The script is simple but well-written, and given that the movie is convincing as a whole one can forgive some predictable moments.So, this is a fun, solid picture, a good blockbuster that rises above most examples of the genre. Consistent entertainment."
5,Exciting return to the past,"If you grew up, as I did, enjoying the adventures of the great Zorro this movie is for you. The portrayal of the characters is true to form, following the classic style of the original story.The end result is expected but along the way the story line is alternately funny, romantic and full of drama. Enjoy a blast from the past and see this remade classic style set of characters."
3,One of Banderas best,"Anthony Hopkins good as mentor, Antonio good as his student. Excellent action sequences."
4,Action-Packed!!!,"""The Mask of Zorro"", starring Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderras, is a fast-paced and highly enjoyable film. The plot is very rich and entertaining. Each actor does a great job of blending adrenaline filled stunts with deep emotional feelings. I feel that it is a must-see for any Zorro, Banderras, or Hopkins fan."
4,Cut scenes make this a meediocre DVD release,They cut out two scenes that seemed like relative parts to the movie... What's the deal? I thought DVD owners were supposed to be getting more than the VHS release....I definitely feel cheated.
4,Great fun for the family!,"This movie harkens back to the golden age of hollywood in the '30s with its bold stunts and cinematography. This version does true credit to the entire DVD medium experience. So gather everyone in the family around, grab you bowls of popcorn and soda and just sit back and enjoy!"
5,Antonio Banderas creates the best cover of Zorro!,"I remember seeing this in the theatre and on video. I loved it on both. Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, and beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones bring this classic tale to life. There have been 40 versions of this film and Antonio Banderas is the first Hispanic/Latin actor to star in it. As the story goes, the old Zorro (Hopkins), trains a new Zorro (Antonio Banderas), to reclaim his daughter (Zeta-Jones), and avenge his enemy. Filled with comedy, fun, warmth, adventure, this film is for everybody. From beginning to end this film is outstanding. I remember visiting in California, and my dad and uncle were arguing over how beautiful Catherine was, ha-ha. Antonio Banderas is hilarious, Hopkins shines, and Catherine is breathtaking. Enjoy!"
4,Jim Klunis' Review,"i liked the movie very much., the scenery appropiate,beautiful. the buildings, costumes, excellent! Antonio, i am now a fan. Catherine Zeta, she has old hollywood looks, and has the potential to excell in the industry for years to come. She is quite a good fencer,and it appears her lessons paid off. Anthony hopkinks, as usual, superb. L.Q.Jones; crusty and deralict, a bonus treat in the movie!"
5,Again and again and again..........,"The first time in many many years I felt like going from the seat in the theater to the ticket booth to have a repeat that very day. The actors are excellent. The interplay between ""Zorro"" and his horse will have you howling!!!!"
5,good dvd,"My little brother is a big fan of antonio banderas' movies, he became a fan ever since antonio banderas started in the movie shrek. He loved this movie and I liked the price, the service, and the shipping through amazon."
4,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY COLLECTION,"When testing a system, this is one to carry along. When I got my home theater I put this DVD in first. The sound is incredible and that was the first time I felt like I was in the movie theater. Awesome story, beautiful heroine, evil villain, and great sword fighting make this one of the best DVDs available. Some scenes might be a bit much for little kids (like a human head in a big jar) but teenagers and parents will enjoy this together. Would be 5 stars if it was anamorphic, but now that the special edition is out, I'll have to upgrade. I've learned my lesson and only buy special editions now, or at least movies with anamorphic transfers."
3,Entertaining Action Film,"Some movies are just fun to watch. The Mask of Zorro moves along at a brisk and entertaining pace. Banderas fits perfectly the character of Zorro.The photography is nice and smooth.Anthony Hopkins almost steals the show in the role of Zorro Sr. Some humor, some action, some love....works good.I sincerely liked the movie....and have seen it several times."
3,The Action is great but the plot needs to be changed,The action in this movie is great. Antonio Banderas does an excellent job along with the other cast members. The only thing wrong with this movie is it's plot. It should have stuck to the other Zorro story lines and had Banderas playing Don Diego returning from Spain to dethrone the evil government and Hopkin's (or another famous actor)playing his father Don Alejandro. Whoever wrote the script must not have read any previous Zorro titles because if they had the plot would have been much better.
4,lots of fun & adventure,"I had a good time watching this swash-buckler. Anthony Hopkins is great as usual, but Antonio Banderas steals the show-good looking-sexy and a great dancer. Sit back, relax and just let yourself be entertained. It's great fun!!!!"
4,"Hopkins shines, Banderas struggles","As always, Sir Anthony Hopkins turns in a fine performance, this time as the legendery Zorro, now nearing retirement. Banderas, as his unlikely protoge, delivers an admirable performance -- but struggles to avoid being overshadowed by Hopkins's overwhelming presence onscreen. Catherine Zeta-Jones provides much needed spark as the spunky daughter of an evil general, and more than holds her own in this swashbuckling adventure.The script combines witty dialogue, for the most part, with believable conflicts -- and a noble storyline which is quite engrossing. The cinematography is breathtaking, lending a sense of realism to an otherwise mythical legend.If you like high adventure, romance, and have a dry sense of humor, this film should be well worth your time."
3,This movie has everything but...,"It has a great look to it and a great storyline. Fantastic swordplay, adventure, romance and one really lacking dance scene. What was with the obvious doubles?Not to put down Antonio but I think this film needed someone else in the starring role. Adrian Paul of Highlander the series is more qualified to play Zorro's (Anthony Hopkins') apprentice. He trained with sword master Bob Anderson on the Highlander set and also has more than ten years of dancing experience. Anyone who has seen flash backs on Highlander the series can see that the part of Alajhandro was made for Adrian Paul. However I do recomend this film. It has a fantastic feel to it. Beautiful costumes, breathtaking shooting locations and over all enthralling storyline."
2,.,"It isn't the worst Hollywood fluff -- there's some effective humor and a few decent sequences -- but it's Hollywood fluff all the same. I don't *need* in-depth characters or high artistry in order to enjoy a film, but the Hollywood fluff of the 90s just strikes me as fundamentally awful -- it consistently tries WAY too hard to be funny, cool, and exciting. Raiders of the Lost Ark was good Hollywood fluff. Robin Hood was decent Hollywood fluff. This is painfully sub-par Hollywood fluff, but it is slightly redeemed by the qualities I mentioned at the beginning of my little ramble. I couldn't actually recommend the movie and continue to respect myself, but if you just feel like watching a silly but mildly entertaining adventure movie, I suppose you might give it a rent."
2,uninteresting,"The beautiful blu ray image and fantastic sound stage could not make up for a weak plot and several unbelievable plot twists. The movie became tedious. My wife watched the entire movie, I could not; sleep became more interesting after a while."
2,"Good at first, then turns boring","The Mask of Zorro began like a true action/adventure/comedy. There's plenty of good fight scenes, loads of laughs, and you're having a heck of a great time. Unfortunately, the last hour turns boring as the fight scenes all look the same and no more humor is injected into the movie. I did like the performances, mainly Anthony Hopkins, who knows how to dazzle a crowd."
5,Neat-o,"This movie is super fantastic! I thought it was going to be a serious movie but it had a lot of wit in it. This movie has a spectacular cast. Anthony Hopkins is great in every role he plays. This just proves that he doesn't only have the persona as a cannibal. Antonio Banderas was the perfect men to play the part of the new Zorro. Not only was he smashing he portrayed a great hero. Catherin Zita Jones was just beautiful. Yeah, this is chock full of violence, love and humor. It is one of my favorites."
3,Please place the review for the Legend of Zorro for The Mask of Zorro,"The movie Legend of Zorro does not play in Australia, come up with wrong region code. Please replace Legend of Zorro with correct movie to play in Australia"
4,Awesome Movie,"It is an awesome movie. I think they are both VERY GOOD. Good cast and story and lots of action. I am confused about one point. It is being advertised as being 1:77 widescreen, but you can look at the back of the box and clearly see that the movie comes in 2:35 widscreen. Shouldn't whoever wrote that information about the movie checked better before he or she wrote that ?"
4,THIS STORY WAS CAPTIVATING (ZORRO),I LIKED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE. THA ACTORS AND THE STORY BOTH ANTONIO BANDERAS AND KATHERINE ZETA JONES WERE WONDERFUL. YES I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!!!
4,Zorro will always be Zorro,"A legend is a legend and it cannot be changed. Yet you can revisit it and modify some details without any risk. Zorro, this Californian Robin Hood, has to fight against the powerful and for the powerless. But Zorro ages and has to find and train a substitute, an heir. The tricky thing is that his wife was killed and his daughter stolen by the governor. Everything will turn OK and a new generation of the legend is ready to live, the next one already out of the oven. The film adds a couple of winks at other films, particularly Batman. The training room and living quarters are in a cave for example. Look for all allusions you can identify and the film will appear as a real patchwork of quotations and borrowings, in other words, with the good bees we have on the screen, perfect honey. And the powerful will be punished and the powerless saved. Zorro will manage to be on time.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
5,Loved It,I really enjpyed this movie! It wasnt a chick flick but it had enough romance to keep us women interested. It was a great action packed movie with tons of great DVD extras
3,Mask of Zorro (Special Edition),"The movie itself was as entertaining and stirring as I remembered from seeing it at the movies, but I was disappointed in the special edition.I bought the special ed for the added features and was annoyed to find that it had no theatrical trailers,no advertising materials, no music video (which I specifically bought this edition for), and only two deleted scenes. My advice to any to buy this edition is this: save your money and just go with the regular version and enjoy this thoroughly entertaining film.Stephanie"
5,"Terrific, Old Fashioned Entertainment","""The Mask of Zorro"" is an expertly crafted, well made film. I like the old fashion aspect about the movie it makes it alot better. This film manages to stimulate, rouse, and entertain without insulting the intellegence of the person watching it. This film will be a classic. Highly reccomended."
5,Ken From Connecticut on Mask of Zorro,"Great flick! Excellent mixture of adventure, romance and light comedy. My wife is in love with it. Ranks right up there with Romancing the Stone, Lethal Weapon and other great action movies. Would highly recommend as a movie both men and women can enjoy."
4,Almost Excellent!,"Anthony Hopkins was magnificent! He set the level too high, although Banderas was OK, you can't compare he's acting to Hopkins, can you. Zeta Jones played a great role, too. She did all the dancing and fighting by herself, you can't say that about Banderas and Hopkins. Hopkins is old and Banderas is short :)) Altogether a great movie!"
2,It's Not Netflix.,"I didn't quite understand how the whole movie purchase worked on Amazon, now I know. I also know now that using Netflix is the greatest thing ever."
1,Enough is enough (times 4),"First came The Mask Of Zorro, followed by the Special Edition, then came the Superbit Deluxe & now (notice I don't say finally because after all this is Sony) Deluxe Edition. Only reason for this release is to promote the upcoming sequel & the only reason to buy it is if you don't have one of the 3 previous editions. Then you'll also get a free ticket to the sequel (which will probably come out in conjunction with a 5th version). Enough already."
1,Worst movie ever! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !,"I would have given this bad movie 0 stars, but the thing wouldn't let me. I'm so surprised Anthony Hopkins would take on such a stupid film. Don't buy this film! ! ! ! !! !! !! !"
1,DON'T BUY THIS TRASH,"THE MARK OF ZORRO (TYRONE POWERS) IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES AND OF COURSE I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST IN LINE TO GO SEE THIS MOVIE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. I DID NOT LIKE ANY OF IT, THEY SHOULD KEPT TO THE ORIGINAL STORY OF A YOUNG DIEGO, INSTEAD OF HAVING ANTHONY HOPKINS PLAY AN OLD AND BITTER DIEGO. HALF THE TIME I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ANTONIO BANDERA'S HEAVY ACCENT. MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE SAID THE LINES IN SPANISH, THAT I COULD OF UNDERSTOOD."
5,OUTSTANDING,"Of all the summer blockbusters made last year, Armageddon, The X-Files, this movie was the best!! Banderas was funny, Hopkins was brilliant, and Zeta-Jones is the most beautiful women in the World.. My Favorite Movie of 1998!"
3,"Enjoyable,fun and refreshingly free of the f-word.","Banderas was ok as Zorro, but I would love to have seen Adrian Paul (Highlander TV series) play the role."
4,An excellent addition to any home theater library.,"Mask of Zorro is a movie that I originally thought looked boring. After viewing this movie on DVD I have to say I was very surprised by this movie, there was plenty of great action and sword dueling without blood or extensive violence. James Horners score and the sound editing is a great treat to 5.1 viewers and the picture is crisp. I highly recommend this movie."
2,This movie does a great job of not provoking thought,"Completely predictable Hollywood version of the famous swashbuckler, the focus is on the snappy one-liners and the sweeping swordfights. But somewhere between bending over backwards to make sure that we take Zeta-Jones' character seriously (she's from the 1800s, but has the confidence and power that a modern gender-conscious audience demands) and bending over backwards to make sure that we take Anthony Hopkins' character seriously (he may be an old drunk man, but he can fight like the devil once he finds his inspiration), this movie lost me."
2,Trite,"This film is basically a collection of cliches and set peices from just about every action/adventure movie ever made. The only difference is that it has been rearranged and given a new paint job. In short, there's nothing here you haven't seen before. The action scenes aren't badly done, but the movie is very, very predictable."
2,AWFUL,"I watched this movie on a 16 hour bus ride from Washington DC. It was absolutley no good. The plot was confusing, and the end was just creepy. The younger Zorro was pathetic, and the older Zorro was too weird. I would not reccomend this movie to families, as there is much violence. There was some historical reference, but not enough to consider this movie historical fiction."
5,Grand Old-Fashioned Entertainment,I loved this film. It actually tells the story and allows the viewer to be woven into thestory of this epic hero. No reliance on CGI or big explosions but story with charactersthat you actually care about. Well-done.
4,Yes to Anthony Hopkins!,"Antonio Banderas is the up-and-coming Zorro, a character fit to have all the young chicks cheering. Great for the role he is in, but gals, you're cheering for the wrong man. Yawn to that young stuff. Anthony Hopkins can't be beat for style, class, brains, world weariness and charisma. Everyone cheers over young Zorro, but sorry, Hopkins takes my vote. I'll take the old man any day of the week.Great stunts -- as compared to over-used computer graphics. The horse stunts and swordplay are awesome."
4,Good Fun!,"This movie is a fun escape from reality. There is humor, action and unbelievable circumstance, but in all, the movie is worth seeing more than once."
5,I love Zorro's DVD!!,"The Mask of Zorro is one of my all time favorites movies! I really enjoy the DVD, It was the first DVD I bought after my parents bought a DVD player....."
4,Real treat to one's eyes without much computer effects!!,"One of the well made movies of recent times (after 'Titanic'!!!) without giving much focus to computer graphics. The screenplay is swift and keeps the viewer busy admiring it. It 's really wonderful to watch Sir Anthony Hopkins who steals the limelight in the initial part of the film. Later Antonio Banderes and Catherina-Zeta_Jones acted superbly and director Martin Campbhel did a great job!! May be for Indian cinema viewers, the climax is a bit familiar!! On the whole, Zorro is back . Any guess over another sequel of the Great Zorro?"
5,Great!,"This was the most satisfying action film I've seen since Indiana Jones. The film contains great action and a stellar cast, but still doesn't take itself too seriously. The viewers have no choice but to enjoy themselves."
5,What a movie!!! Don't be stupid and SEE IT!,"The girl in this movie is totally fine! There is great action ! It's a good story line! It keeps you wanting more! It's such a good movie because not many movies are done about mexican heroes and this is as close as they come.! Every HISPANIC should defenetly see this movie! Heck, EVERYONE should see this movie, you would be missing alot if you were'nt!"
3,"Humor, Romance, and Comedy.","Continue movies of previous Zorro. Protecting poor and bring justice to Mexican Citizens. Later call themself ""California Citizen"". Catharine Zeta-Jones did good performance and attractive actress."
3,Large Bauble,This is a very pretty ring but my hands are rather small. It looked like costume jewelry on my hands so I returned the ring.
4,Gentle and beautiful.,"The ring itself (gold part) is not as thick as it is on the picture, but still beautiful. This is the only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars.Overall I am happy with the purchase."
1,Cheap Ring cutter,The cutter broke during first use. The wheel came off and would not screw back on. The thread was wasted.
2,okay but no anywhere near great,"The cutting wheel on the ring cutter I received is bent a tad but, making it difficult to turn the blade. After buying the same type of ring cutter on epay and getting a defective one I will live with the one that I have. I would not recommend this product."
4,Great CD old meets new,"This CD has a great list of songs, the motown medley is unbelieveable with Ruffin and Kendricks of the Temptations! The harmonys are great blue eyed souls and hitsville. Great energy on the cd plus some of hall and oats greats like ""everytime you go away""."
4,Great sound for a live album,"Very well-produced live effort from Daryl Hall & John Oates with guest appearances from David Ruffin & Eddie Kendrick.The album's sound is so crisp and clean you'd think it was a studio production.Best cuts are ""I Can't Go For That"" and ""Every Time You Go Away"". Ruffin and Kendrick perform well too.Buy the video of this while you're at it..."
5,black 'n white soul,"how sad they stopped pressing this cd, now i have to do with a used one, though well preserved; this shows that hall and oates know how to play soul!"
4,Saved our dog!,"All these reviews are correct (and funny!). This is loud, but we keep it on low all the time. The rest of it is wonderful. Our dog had pneumonia last winter. She had a couple of rounds of antibiotics, which took care of her fever and congested lungs, but she could not stop coughing up phlegm for months. She went for x-rays and was headed for ultrasound next. We had a small humidifier, but purchased this after Christmas and the very first night we had it on her coughing disappeared and only comes back when we don't use it. We had no idea we had such allergens existing in our bedroom. It would be nice if Holmes worked on the sound issue, but as far as the performance of humidifying and purifying our air, we wouldn't live without it."
2,Very lound,I just got it in time for Christmas and had it on for 30 mins. I couldn't stand the noise any more. When I just turned it on at the high setting it sounded like my expensive dryer. So I turned to the low setting but still lound enough to interfere the conversation. I will return it and get 2 or 3 warm mist humidifiers instead. The warm mist type is much quieter.
1,Biggest Piece of Junk I Have ever owned,"I bought this and brought it home, set it up and turned it on. I went downstairs and thought that someone was doing constriction outside. One of the fans continually droned and vibrated; causing so much noise I could not use it. I thought it was a fluke so I sent a message to Holmes which they did not respond to. I returned it and replaced it with another identical model. I set it up and turned it on and was satisfied. I went to bed only to wake up to it turning off and on and from high to low. I looked at the display and it was alternating from a humidity level of 40 all the way to 75, and all numbers between. Also it was randomly cycling between all levels of power. I turned the unit off and went back to bed. To my surprise it turned itself back on and again cycled through different power levels and modes. Stay away from this model and I am not impressed with the lack of customer service from Holmes."
1,Loud and inconvenient,"I bought this humidifier about week ago and will be taking it back asap. There are two different modes: a high/medium/low and an automatic on/off depending on the room's humidity level (it sounds like a really good idea, right...). The first, always-on type setting is very loud. The other, automatic setting is intolerable. If you do purchase this, make sure you have a spot planned for it where it will not be near bedrooms since you can hear it through closed doors and walls. The one star that this equipment gets is for the fact that it can pump a lot of water out really quickly. Other negatives are that it's really hard to fill without using the bathtub and that you can't rest the water tanks on its top when you're filling it (they're inconveniently curved, so you have to hold up most of the weight of the water tank while trying to finagle it in the bathtub)."
3,Bought 2 1 great one Bad,I bought two of these units one sounded like a b-52 landing went set to med or high. HOWEVER the other one sounded almost as quite on 3 as 1.Sounds like there quality contraol is lacking. But I really like the one that sounds quite. It also puts out a lot of water.Good unit for the money. I bought mine at costco for[...]Just make sure you can return the item. Not one to buy online for sure!
4,NICE LOOK INTO THE PAST,"THE LENS IS THE NAME OF THE BAND THAT ORFORD AND HOLMES WERE IN PRIOR TO I.Q. THESE ARE THE SONGS THAT THEY HAD AND THEY ARE ENTERTAINING. THERE ARE VERY FEW VOCALS BUT IF YOU LIKE GOOD PROG INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC THIS IS A MUST. I FOR ONE AM HAPPY TO HAVE ""LOOKED THROUGH"" THESE LENSES."
4,Geneik-Moomandt,"People who want an extension of Okie coupled with beat-manifesto of mark pember.aka. Meat Katie this one goes for them. Its like giving away the hardcore deep groove for something differnt that can be quite easily attributed to Howie B. Its like getting on a ride, which for sure will take you through some of the widely heard genres on the dancefloors around europe and americas and yet sound devilshly diffrent. I must warn you it will take SOME time(somewhere after garbage's cherry lips) to get into the groove and after that you will think of ""money spent well"".Groove Description: Breakish, Electro, Progressive, yet housy."
1,I didn't like the ending at all.,"This was the first Arthur Book I bought for my four year old daughter...who very strongly believes in Santa . As I was nearing the end of this book while reading it to her, I realized where we were going with the ending. I understand if your target age is ten years old or so and they are doubtful, but I had to explain to my daughter after we finished the book why Santa didn't eat the stuff that Arthur had worked so hard on, and why the sister got rid of it all. I bought this book at a school book fair, and I was really looking forward to introducing her to Arthur Books. Now, I can't say that I'll ever buy another one."
2,"NOT a review of the music, but of Amazon","Normally I dislike when people post product reviews that don't directly relate to the product, but Amazon GIVES NO OTHER OPTION. I removed this disk from my wish list because I found it substantially cheaper at another web site. When I did this, the following message pops up from Amazon: ""Please tell us more so we can improve the quality of our recommendations for you."" Clicking on the link takes you to the ""create your review"" page. I can only surmise that this is what Amazon wants me to do.For artists not in the mainstream of what some might call today's popular music, sites like CDBaby are much better. Amazon needs to learn this lesson. I am finding that I am purchasing from Amazon less and less, and not only music & books."
1,Disappointing,"With songs like Pentaluma Afternoons and Old Mistake in the discography, I found this CD to be unmemorable. It cured my insomnia and was regretably low energy. Susan Werner has a magnificent voice, ill used in this ill advised release.My first experience in Werner's music was I Still Believe - I still believe Susan's return to the more folk rock pop style with strong lyrics and fewer self indulgent forays will garner more favorable response from this fan."
5,WOW!,"Great review book. I had to take the Praxis I just last week and so I ordered this book along with a few others to help me prepare. Not having had algebra and geometry for 14 years, I was very rusty to say the least. This book far exceeded my needs, but better to know too much than not enough right. I missed a perfect score on the math section by 2 points. Did this book help? You bet!"
2,"If you are taking the GRE, then don't buy this book.",This book wasn't made for people who are taking the GRE or the SAT. It covers the most basic of facts and it doesn't explain anything in depth. If a person is taking the GED then he might find this book useful.
2,Very basic math,"Hey this is not even for for fifth graders. So, do not bother buying it. Ok. alteast this was too basic for me and one would expect a GRE taker to know all this previous hand."
1,didnt like it,"dont like the format and missing a lot of info. I bought it because I forgot some basics and there not even in this book.,"
4,Good Book,"This book is definitely a good book to look into if you haven't seen math in a long time or would like to brush up on some areas that maybe gave you a hard time in the pass. The book break things down with a few examples and also have you practice them as well. At the end of each chapter, the book gives you a test based on what you learned throughout the chapter itself. Honestly, if you take your time and understand each problem within the book, taking the test they give you in the book shouldn't be a problem at all. At the same time, don't assume this is the only book you should be looking at for those who are taking the GRE and especially the GMAT. This good is a good start to brush up a few weaknesses you have but definitely get a much harder book in the near future because I know for sure that the GRE and GMAT would not be this easy on the exam. I think this book would definitely make anyone feel confident and prepared for any math exam. Highly recommend this book for sure."
4,Great review,"I took a lot of math in college, then proceeded to forget most of it. I wanted to see how much I could remember. This book is a lot of fun. Highly recommended."
3,Very Good Book But Abit Inadequate For GRE,"This is a very good book to learn the presented concepts. But I found that the questions presented in GRE test are of higher difficulty that what is presented in this book. If doing GRE, look for a book with harder questions. The ones in this book are too easy and can mislead you to think that the questions in the GRE will be as simple.Otherwise, a good book."
5,"Great, easy to review",I got this book because I was going back to college. It's been a few years since I dropped out and they required me to take a placement test. I was worried because my math had become incredibly rusty.The way the book is setup is awesome. You take a pretest before every chapter and then they give you an answer sheet with page numbers so you can find where in the book you need to look on how to solve that problem. This book actually taught a few things better and easier than some of my HS teachers. I thought it was incredibly effective and it mostly saved me time because I think that I would've done well either way but I would've just had to study more. I literally only went through the book once and found the sections that it said I should brush up on and it worked like charm.
4,Yes,Absolutely love it .. I ordered used one and it looks like new with2 days free shipping ..This book every thing SAT test taker will need even the basic math ..
2,Not helpful for CBEST.,Too hard to navigate and find the exact help needed for CBEST exam. Would be helpful for students needing SAT/ACT help.
5,TO THE POINT!,"This was an outstanding book that helped me with college algebra and I know it will help me and my wife in the near future with our children! It gets right to the point. You do not search for ""hours"" looking for assistance. Even though it lacks an index, the table of contents is organized in such a manner for speedy searches."
4,Mathematically Challenged,This book will save you if you are bad/rusty on math skills. Talks about every subject that is covered on GRE in detail with examples. Great buy for anyone taking a math class or studying for a standardized test.
4,Good book to Review all the math of the GRE,I used this book to review all the basic math of the GRE. So far I've been happy with the book bc it gives you all the steps in the practice problems so that you know how they got the answer they did. It also has problems that you work on your own to practice the math you just learned. They have math diagnostic tests which are helpful in seeing your areas of weakness. At the end of each major math groups there is a mini-final exam that tests your knowledge which is a nice bonus. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is studying for the GRE and hasn't done any of the math that the GRE tests in at least 4 years. I gave it 4 stars because there is no CD for practice GRE questions or any other online aid/extra practice problems.
5,Excellent resource for my daughter,It has what my daughter needs to prepare for her high school entrance exam. Many thanks to the seller who offered this book at a rock-bottom price.
4,Great studying tool,"You have to know at least a little bit, but it all started coming back to me after 15 years with this great studying tool. Lots of practice questions with explanations."
5,A great math supplement,"Through college and my occupation, I have been away from math for years. However, I am planning on going to grad school, so I wanted to brush up and polish my math skills. I read the reviews for this book, and I would agree with all the positive remarks. This book is organized well, makes sense, and is generally helpful. This covers basic math, such as algebra, geometry, statistics, etc. Don't expect to understand calculus after reading this, but this book certainly helps with understanding fundamental approaches to math. The lessons/overviews are clear, the practice/drill questions are helpful, and the organization makes sense. Each main section has a 100 question review test that helps to solidify operations and concepts. Math makes more sense to me from this book than any time before."
5,great math review.,"i got this to cram for the GRE math section, and it totally helped. it was a great refresher on math i had completely forgotten and has tons of practice problems to do. i highly recommend it and gave it to a friend who saw a 70 point jump in her math score!"
5,Also great for ASVAB prep.,I bought this book when I was getting ready to take the ASVAB to join the military. I got a much higher score on the ASVAB after reviewing the entire math section involving word problems and percentages. I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to improve the ASVAB score. It's so easy to find what you are looking for in this book. It's very important that you review everything in this book from the beginning( the basics) to the end.
4,A great rhyming book,"...The artwork is very bright and child-friendly, and the rhyming is equally friendly. Note the rhymes/story on each page are not as short as a Dr. Seuss book. The line I gave at the top of this review is typical of what you will read on a page. Young readers may want to move on faster than you want to read, but once you've read it a few times and memorized the story flow, it's easy to get through. A great addition to a collection for toddlers."
3,An ok book,My 19-month old daughter is still into the flipping the pages of different books but this book does not seem to catch her eye.
2,Not a purchase I would do again,A bit tough to put on. Thick is great for durability but makes it impossible to use with case and have no bubbles. looks great on until it gets used the. Smudges and scratches are all you notice plus not easy to see In bright conditions
5,"Works well, if not under direct light",Mirror works very well but becomes troublesome when under direct light as it reflects towards you.
5,Great Product!,"Great Product! Inexpensive, easy to apply and use, protects really well against scuffs and fingerprint marks. Way better than the JAVOedge screen protector (Microswipes variety 4-pack) I also purchased and discarded."
3,Cool Idea,The mirror cover is a really cool idea and when you arent using your phone it looks cool but when you are using the phone it is hard to see the screen in the daylight. I took mine off soon after putting it on.
2,"Cool, but annoying","The idea is very cool and it deflects anyone who is near to see what you're doing, but to create the illusion of the mirror, it causes this holographic image. It hurt my eyes and gave me a headache. I took it off after a couple of days and just through it out. Waste of money really."
1,"I never got it,","I waited for this but I never received it. I sent two emails. They replied to the first one. Still waiting on the second response I sent last week. They wanted to verify my address (which it was correct except for the postal code that I couldn't verify). I checked my mail every day. I paid about 6 dollars for the screen protector so I probably don't mean much to them but I think they can do a better job for all customers including their ""small"" ones. This is my first experience with them. I hate to pay for something and get nothing in return."
1,not what I expected at all,"The image would lead you to believe the product would give your iPhone screen a ""mirror like"" appearance. Either I was sent the wrong product or this is just false advertising, but it's just a screen protector, no matter at what angle you hold the phone. Whether the screen is active or inactive, it's still just a screen protector. No mirror like appearance at all."
1,Not pratical,"Like everyone else has said, it's not pratical to use. It looks very cool, but you just can't see a thing in bright daylight. It leaves a dirty mark every time you touch the screen."
3,"The mirror effect makes the ""air bubbles"" even more apparent",I have had experience putting screen protectors on phones for several years. I generally do pretty good with installation and have a minimum amount of air bubbles underneath the screen.With this protector I cleaned the phone very well before installing and ended up with numerous air bubbles/pockets. I was able to use a squeegie like device and get most of them out but the ones that are still there are seemingly magnified due to the mirror surface. It makes them much more apparent than a standard clear or anti-reflective screen protector.
1,"Yes, it's a mirror but the penalty is when viewing in sunlight.","It's a protector, a mirror, and...really difficult to see the screen in sunlight. Best for those who use the iphone/ipod mostly indoors."
3,Not that great of an item,"I got it since it was novel to me. I don't hate it, but I don't love it. The outer side of the screen protector is very sensitive and creates scratches (even while putting it on the phone). Once the screen protector is put on, you have to get used to the new feeling of looking through the protector: it feels as if you're looking through a screen. Once, you get used to it, it's not that bad. Since the screen protector is a little thick, the touch screen sometimes become a little desensitized. I plan to use this until the novelty wears off for me and decided to just buy a real, good screen protector from the Apple store, as I have learned through my mistakes from ordering cheap screen protectors. You always get your money's worth."
1,sent screens for ipod not iphone,very dissappointed. i gave them away. not worth the trouble and hassle of dealing with this. I expected to receive I-Phone covers and received I-Pod covers !!!
1,Terrible customer service,"I could list all the emails and telephone calls back and forth with importer520, but I won't waste your time like they wasted mine. I ordered a product 12 days ago and have yet to received it. I spoke to a rep today from importer520, and first thing she offers me is a refund, instead offering me to reship the product, ahhh duh! Then I was told they would only reship if I removed my negative comments about them on Amazon. Can you believe this! importer520....never again."
2,"Not bad, good screen protection","Ok like everyone else says, the outdoor use is not good at all, but indoors it's great. It's was cheap so I was curious about it, looks cool when its off...mirror finish looks wild. But outside your phone isn't really usable. I ended up taking it off if you don't use your phone much outdoors then this might work for you...hey it's cheap so why not"
1,Very disappointed,"This screen protector looks awesome, don't get me wrong - but it's completely impractical. It's really hard to see through in normal light and almost impossible to see through in sunlight/outdoors/bright lighting. Too bad.. it looked super awesome on the iphone :("
5,Beautiful,This fit perfectly on my iPhone and works great! I would suggestto run your brightness all te way up when reading emails or viewing videos and pics as it is a little hard to see with the reflection. Other than that it is great for a quick make up check :)
1,It didn't work,"The shields go on really smoothly and stick well, however while I had it on my phone it affected the phone, I kept dropping calls constantly which had never happened before and has not happened again since I took the shield off. It may be the material it is made with or the weight of it, but it caused the phone to not work well. Also the mirror image is not clear enough to use as a mirror. Good price, not a good product, sorry."
3,Useful,"It's useful, but really diminishes the amount of light that comes up from the screen of the phone."
2,America: The Root of All Evil,"America is bad. Everybody else is either good, or not responsible for their bad actions because, of course, America is to blame. Leftist propaganda. I give it 2 stars because the writing it good. The Michael Parentis of the world are useful to maintain balanced perspective. His extreme leftist views are useful to balance the extreme right views of others. He is not however to be regarded as the last word on his subject."
1,C'mon dude!,"Give us a break Parenti.This guy rails against US patriotism ""exploited"" to promote free markets, global stability, prosperity, peace, and freedom while silent to the ""patriotism"" of his communist cousins who use their patriotic fervor to ""promote"" despotism, poverty, and violence.It isn't patriotism Parenti is against, it is capitalism, christianity, and representative governance.Google ""thinly veiled communist promotion"" and you will see this book title.btw, comrade parenti is a member of the communist party of America and I can guarantee that every contributor who recommended this book is a diehard automaton Leftist."
3,my personal review,"This film has all the elements, cute actors like Shiri Appleby (which was the only reason I bought the film Ha!) All and all the acting is rather bad, Kevin Pollak was terrible, and Michael Goorigian look far too sensible to be the averrage high school geek. This film was too predictable with Henry getting the girl at the end, but my didn't they look good together.If you are thinking of buying this film, don't,unless your a big fan of Roswell Hign (Shiri Appleby), or Party Of Five (Michael Goorgian).I rate it three stars because Shiri Appleby shined this average low budget film up."
3,Okay but not great,I got this movie because it was cheap and I'm a big fan of Shiri Appleby from the show Roswell. This is one of those movies were you really need to be a fan of one of the actors to enjoy it.
3,Comedy,Shiri Appleby is the only reason I bought this movie. As usual Shiri turns in a great performance. Just not enough scenes with her in it.
2,Its was okay.,I wanted this movie because Shiri was in it. She of course did excellent in the acting. The other people in it were somewhat disappointing. I prefer Bedazzled over this movie.
5,excellent,"This vídeo os excellent, I will consider purchasing un the near future great quality, perform a plus, what I really liked was fast ir arrived in time l thanks"
3,So much Fun for those times that you just don't want to thin,"This movie is completely stupid and trite and you know exactly what's going to happen the whole time. However, the production is fun and not a typical hollywood one. And everynow and then you get the feeling that the movie is making fun of itself anyway. I really enjoyed how they didn't JUST use pretty people in the movie...like the not so cool girl was actually really average looking which definately gave me a bit of respect for the movie. In the long run, i'd say don't get this movie unless your a big Mike Goorjian Fan, which i happen to be. If you are a big Mike Goorjian fan you will not be dissapointed...he's absolutely adorable in it and still shines through his talent even though the role he plays is very much against his type."
5,"Cool, sweet, and satisfying like a gelato!","What a wonderful, educational, language kit from the beautiful design of the box, booklet and CDs to the ease of the lessons and ability to REMEMBER them!If you have ever been in a foreign country where you don't speak the language, you know how frustrating it can be to get around. If you devote just a good half hour to a lesson or two a day, you will be able to have a basic tourist fluency that will make you want to learn even more.Italian is such a beautiful language and I have always wanted to learn it; now I have more confidence to take that desire to the next level. If you are fortunate enough to be going to Italy and want to navigate the canals and piazzas with impunity (LOL), this is definitely the guide to take!"
3,How does one pronounce 'pronunciation'?,"I've only got 3 weeks to learn Italian of which I didn't know a word, before going to the Venito for 2 weeks in May. What a hope. I'm fairly impressed with the method and have learned a lot in the last one and a half weeks. I know it's silly but it annoys me each time he pronounces 'pronunciation'; 'pronoUnciation'. I would have thought a detail like that would have been caught by the editors. I find the speed of the speakers incredibly fast but I think that is intentional--they are trying to prepare you for what you will encounter and any new language seems rapid fire to a debutant.I'm only starting Unit 4 but already I've been annoyed when they use a bit of vocabulary that hasn't been introduced but maybe that is intentional too;So far I am impressed with the method"
3,A Decent Supplement,"I read, write and speak Italian at a moderately accomplished level. Of course, I haven't had to read, write or speak it in about 18 months, and so my skills and comprehension have diminished over time. This set is useful and effective for practice, especially the necessary practice of the ear, of hearing the language spoken and hearing yourself speak it. If you have some level of Italian and want to maintain it, this Oxford set is a good and reasonably priced choice. Also, if you want to learn enough Italian to get you through a trip to the country, this would also do the job for you.However, this in no way is a true course in the language, which means studying Italian in the cultural context, developing the ability to read stories and novels, newspapers and magazine, and discuss daily life with adequate skills - the Oxford set will not bring you to that point. So, evaluate your needs, and choose accordingly."
4,A reader,An excellent concise review of material learned through a whole semester. I used it as my primary source in preparing for the CLEP in American Government. I passed the exam with ease. (I also used the Complete Idiot's Guide to American Goverment as a secondary source)
5,Perfect if you need to brush up!,This gives the perfect overview of the American Government if you just need the facts. I wouldn't consider it an introductory book however - it definitely assumes you have some prerequisite knowledge. They even throw in some trivia to make the read more interesting. Book arrived on time and just as expected. I would recommend this seller.
1,"Leak, my floor got flooded","I brought this unit and the first time I fill it with water and started it, noticing the water just keep going at a faster than expect speed... and my floor was wet... I thought I did not do it right and went to read more on the instruction... I tried it again. fill with water, and just leave the unit off. 30 mins later, my floor was flooded... half of the water gone... I am going to return it!"
2,"Noisy, leaks, dies....","Bought this humidifier last winter. Worked reasonably well for 3 months before it died. However, the unit was quite noisy - it is designed in a way that boiling noise is amplified and loud enough to be disturbing when watching TV. In addition, the design results in water condensing and ending up on the floor. Thirdly, the after filling the tank, it was usually very hard to get it restarted - impossible to get the empty tank to turn off. Last, the design makes it hard to clean the heating element after a while. The element has a non-stick coating but this coating disappears over time. Can not recommend this unit!Addendum: I think I will upgrade this unit to 3 stars. After all, it did work well for 3 months."
3,Darth Vader Helmet Review,Item was received in a timley manor. It was for Halloween.It worked great. The only problem was the top helmet part does not stay connected to the base (lower portion)very well.Also we didn't conside the fact that the dark eye lenses were a problem at night tine trik-or- treating.
4,Darth Vader Voice Chamger Review,"This in combination with my Master FX lightsaber and Deluxe Vader Costume helped me cause such a BUZZ last Halloween! ""That-that's not really Darth vader, is it?"" ""Darth Vader looks a little thin this year---OH MY GOD, IT'S A GIRL!!!"""
4,I didn't know Darth was potty trained!,"So inexpensive we had to get two. One for my three year old boy and the other for my 5 year old boy. They just LOVE 'em. Three weeks after we received them and they still put them on their heads several times a day. My only complaint is that the shell splits away from the mask (as designed), but a bit too easily. Since my boys' heads are so small they don't need to split the helmet to take it on or off, so I just taped it together with some strong duct tape."
4,THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE,"Sure. The box is aptly labeled as ""ages 5 and up"". Good thing being in your 20's is, technically, still on the ""and up"" range. What I am trying to say is that adults who are fans of the Star Wars phenomenon will definitely love to be in the shoes (or helmet) of everyone's favorite Sith Lord, Darth Vader. The breastplate that they mentioned that's ""included"" is a part of the voice changer, and not an actual separate item. The set may not be a complete Vader costume, but it will definitely satisfy your fantasy of galactic domination. The downside? Actual Empire and minions do not come with the box."
3,Not Bad,"This item is cool, the voice changer is not what I expected,and the top of the helmet is near impossible to stick on, I had to tape it tot he mask portion of the helmet, but not bad!!"
3,Looks cool on the shelf,"This helmet was a gift for my 10 year old. Looks nice sitting on his shelf but not a practical ""toy"". Helmet is in 2 pieces that come apart during wear (back piece falls off). Very hot to wear for any period of time and also annoying (and claustrophobic) when on. Glad we bought it even if he never uses it - it's a nice Star Wars collectible. And it looks cool on the shelf."
4,Two piece helmet is frustrating,"We got this helemt to go with my six-year-old son's Darth Vader costume for Halloween. It looks fantastic! The only downside to this accessory is that the two pieces of the helmet do not stay together very well--a little trick-or-treat gum did the trick for the night, but for the money one should not have to improvise with treats! Other than that annoying issue, the helmet is fun for any Star Wars fan, and looks great on."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this toy for my nephew for Christmas as was quite disappointed in it. After reading some of the other reviews, maybe there are things I could have done to improve the voice changer, i.e. put in new batteries, move microphone. We tried to change the batteries, but couldn't find a screwdriver to fit the small hole. Next time I see him I'll try the suggestions above, hopefully the voice changer will work better. If I paid less than $25 I would be very happy with it, but for over $40..not worth it."
3,Not a hit at a Childrens Star Wars Birthday Party,"Unfortunately, the Voice Changer portion of this item was the major purpose of our purchase. Our son wanted a Star Wars Theme Birthday party and really wanted this to play with his friends. While the breath, and the pre-recorded sayings sounded great, the voice changer portion sounded like some cheap dollar store item. The helmet was ditched in moments and none of the boys liked it. Too bad, it had a lot of potential, but ended up being a waste of money."
2,let down,"i bought this because i was gonna use it for halloween, thinking that when you use the voice changer option, your voice would at least sound something like Darth Vader, howerver this was not the case. Your voice sounds nothing like Vader, but rather your own voice, with a barely audible ""Darth Vader"" echo...very dissapointing, especially considering the price"
5,BEST TOY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a really great toy. Don't belive any of the bad reivews you hear because their wrong.so if you're onig to the mall and you come across this toy, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Or beg your parents to buy it for you. BECAUSE YOU NEED IT."
4,"Nifty for adults, but too heavy for kids","My sister picked up one of these babies for me tonight, and I had a blast playing around with this helmet. As advertised, the mask is adjustable to fit your head. And the voice functions are really neat. The helmet itself is surprisingly hard and sturdy. The eyepieces are fairly wide, and you could see out of the mask. And despite my initial concern, you could breathe through the mask without any problem.However, the voice box is pretty heavy, and drags down the heavy helmet. So it may not be suitable for really young kids due to the weight of this item."
3,what the <<<<< is this?!?,"what on earth! a talking head?!? sry, i am here 2 put this toy down. now we begin,,, so a head thats all that just says phraseswhen u press the red black or black!{look i am not sure of da colors}i mean realy! get real! cmon who will b my back up! triple h! hit humpy head! lol"
3,"Be wary if ""Try Me"" mode doesn't work in box","Our mask (ordered by mail) arrived with the ""Try Me"" functions not working. I thought this was likely due to the batteries having run down from repeated use or something. Which turned out to be the case, but wasn't the full story. When we put in new batteries, the evident problem was that the ""breathing sounds"" button was semi-permanently ""on."" And there's no off switch, so you need to take the batteries out if you want some relief from Lord Vader's ceaseless attention!"
2,Fun Doesn't Last Long,My son got this for his birthday. It does not fit comfortably on his head. The fun wears off in about 5 minutes. I don't think it is worth the money...maybe if it was half off.
5,AWESOME!!!!!!,"This is SUCH a cool toy! everything about is gret. I recommend it for all ages! The only, ONLY, bad part, is that u can hear your voice, and his at the same time."
4,It's Fun,This mask will fit all comers. It's as much fun as you think it will be. The voice changer works well and is very easy to use. I would say if your a fan of Star Wars this is a must have.
2,Wow what a waste of money...,"Sure this is good for looks, and the actual sayings fromt he movie, but I mess around with this at work all the time, and it really is a piece of crap. When you try to talk into it, it just sounds like a broken microphone... it's just staticy.."
1,it broke in 2 days,"if you have a child that can break things vary easy, I don't think you should buy this. if you do be careful when taking it out of the box.thank you"
2,I was kind of disappointed,"I bought this Helmet not too long ago, and it was great looking in it's box. It took a while to get it out, and had to adjust it to my head to try it out. The pre-recorded voice came out nicely. It is the voice changer that I had trouble with. The voice changer has three level button on it, and I tried all of'em. None realy worked. I mean it, not a single one of them even came close. At times as I have read in other reviews I had to shout just to hear the outcome, which you could probably tell that it would have sounded bad. I tried to wisper my breathing and I got close to the original breathing voice of Vader. I am a big fan of Star Wars, but this is pretty disappointing."
5,awesome,im 22 years old and this helmet is awesome when playing Texas Hold'em everyone stares at you and can't believe you're actually wearing it and therefore can't concentrate and lose! BUY IT!
3,Lol? wtf?,This is a very good helmet lmao im 17 and i got this helmet when i was 12... any reason why this is $200? i got this at ToysRus when i was 12 for $39.99... lmao The Voice changer is trash but for looks...Very nice
4,Star wars Darth Vader Voice Changing Helmet,"I loved it! I actually bought this for my 7 years old daughter's birthday, but I really think that my husband and I had more fun playing with it than she did! She loved it too, of course!"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This is a good mask and the breathing sound effect is cool too. However the voice changer is absolutley the worst I have ever encountered. Star Wars should be embarassed that they actually used the title ""Voice Changer"" because it does a super poor job of changing your voice. You do not sound like Vader at all. DO NOT BUY THIS MASK IF YOU EXPECT TO SOUND LIKE DARTH VADER. Buy this mask if you need the helmet and chest piece to complete your Vader costume."
3,kids gift,"the product was enjoyed by the birthday boy. Amazon helped me to make him happy I could not find the product at any of the stores in the area. I, as a grandmother could not bear the thought of someone's expectations not being satisfied. Thank you again"
4,My Homeez! the best PRANK CALLING DEVICE of all time!!!!!,"Oh man this thing is great! or at least it looks great, haha. I don't actually have one but it looks like the most best prank prank calling device of all time! oh yah, and for me and my brother and my friend's movies! Oh yah! SWC productions all the way guys. Haha! boy will i be laughin the next time i prank call taco bell and ask them how much it costs to cater a wedding. Yah Elk Grove Taco Bell thats been getting prank calls all their life, that was me! Casey! Muahaha this is the most best voice changer of all time!!!"
1,ill give this toy 44 thumbs...down!,"this is the worst toy ive ever seen! you cannot hear the other voice, just your own. the quality is terrible. it just makes you sound like a robot i'd give this a 0. i thought hasbro could do a better job. i have nothing against toys r us. take this off the shelves"
1,worst thing out there,i am 10 yrs old and this toy is terrible! it didint make my voice sound like darth it made my voice sound stupid. dont buy this toy!
3,S'okay,"It's fine as a filter, but if you are looking for something long term for an aquatic turtle habitat think bigger. The first set up is a pain in the butt, after a few cleanings you get used to it, but it is still a pain to disconnect and reconnect. As far as cleaning. It does a good job, but the intake gets clogged every once in a while causing it to lose suction, which puts a strain on the motor. It might just be my turtles mess causing this problem, but thought I would mention it as it has happened a number of times. In all a decent filtration system."
4,Ok for the price,"Pros- power switch on the unit, high water flow, easy filter replacement.Cons- with pump on bottom difficult to get air out of system, room for filter media small making it difficult to use more than one type of media at a time, quick release valves between pump and tank leak air on intake side creating air pocket in filter chamber, noise level high due to air inside unit and included hoses will crimp or collapse easilyFor the cost a great filter if you can get all the air out of it. Decided I would rather have another Fluval filter instead and will only use this guy for specific filter media like the micron filter to clear water quickly"
2,Pain in the butt!,"I bought this canister for my 60 gallon tank of discus. It took a long time to get together and get working, but then when I needed to switch out the media inside the canister, all heck broke loose. The lid on the charcoal holder kept coming off getting charcoal everywhere. And the silicone ring to keep a water-tight seal on the lid kept falling off, getting lost inside of the canister. Don't waste your money and just get a Fluval."
4,Clean well!,Works well but can be a pain to clean when it's dirty. It gets dirty pretty quick since it cleans very well. I suggested having towels and buckets around when cleaning. Try cleaning in the sink or bath tub.
5,The best filter for my turtle!,"This is the best filter for my red-eared slider and his three friends, Curly, Larry and Moe, the three goldfish I threw in the tank to keep him company. The water is clear as a bell and George the turtle is very happy!! Highly recommended."
4,Very Good!,It's the only Sylvia Tyson CD I own and I've loved it since I bought it in 1994. Good variety of selections. I recommend it.
1,dragon incense burner,"I didn't realize that this was made of resin instead of metal. I think it even comes with a warning not to put anything hot in it. And since it doesn't come with any kind of tray to set the incense on, how can you burn incense in it? It's attractive enough. I just don't like resin products."
5,Wife Approved Remote,"I got the TX-1000 to replace an earlier damaged ( I steped on it ) Universal Remote Control MX-800.My surround system is a multi-componet system and my wife is a ""techno-ticked"" person who wants a easy and direct method of controling the ""tv"".This remote ( with the URC provided software ) had the control functions of ALL my individual remotes.ALL buttons can be used in a custom macro. There are even discrete on/off's that were not on the maufacturer's remotes. That makes the macro programming very direct.Just be sure wherever you purchase this from is an authorized Universal Remote Control dealer. If you buy this from a ""third party seller"" URC will not honor the sale and will not provide the programming software."
1,Beware...motor burned out in 4 months,Bottom line: We bought it. Loved it. Used it once a day on juice and fruit smoothies (nothing to harsh). Motor burned out in less than four months and we've been able to get no help from the Oster people. It's now a $90 paper weight. Buyer beware.
2,Oster Fusion Blender with Food Processor Attachement,Machine does everything they say and more BUT replacement parts are hard to come by. Oster/Sunbeam Customer Service center is NOT helpful. We got the Oster Fusion with the food processor attachments but the blade for shredding is missing and the company has not been helpful at all. There has been no response whatsoever from the company after NUMEROUS attempts at contacting them. The machine totally died after about three months of less then average use.There are cheaper models that work almost as well but this is mighty powerful it just sucks that we are missing a vital part of the machine and it is a heck of a lot easier to grate cheese with that missing part and if the machine still worked and the warranty was honored. Save your money and buy a better model.
1,* I returned it *,"I've had it for one month and have used it 3 times. Blender worked great for the three times. The fourth times I used it with no indication of a problem previously, it would not turn on. This is very sad, to have a blender only work three times and quit. I returned it back to the store."
1,Do NOT buy this blender! It's defective!,"I purchased one in June 2007. By November it quit working; it would just not turn on. I complained violently to Oster and they sent me a replacement unit and by April that unit crapped out with the same problem. I have had several Oster blenders over the years and they all have failed prematurely. Their quality is horrible and they obviously don't care. I am sick of filling up my blender with ingredients just to turn it on to find out it won't work.Yea, this model was OK while it was working, but it is not worth the hassle.DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER!"
2,Quit working within a year,"I had an Oster beehive I used most every day for 4 years or more. When it came time to replace, and as I had such great experience with the beehive, I decided to ""upgrade"" to the Oster Fusion. I loved the unit until it quit working within a year of daily use. Since I use it everyday for smoothies, I then decided to buy the best and got a Vita-mix which I've only had a few weeks. So far so good and it has a very long warranty, I think 5 years."
2,Works great until it dies on you.,"I used it mainly for margaritas and other frozen drinks. This thing crushes ice nicely.As other reviews have said, this thing doesn't last very long. Mine lasted about a year being used maybe once or twice a month."
5,Fusion is the Sports Car of the Blender World,"I am a man's man, and I am absolutely in love with this blender. It sounds like a Corvette and literally bucks from all the power when you hit the frozen drink/shake button and makes me the smoothest shake I have ever had in my life! I am so glad I bought it...initially I was saying to myself ""why am I paying this much for a blender?"" but now I just smile when my powerful little Corvette-like blender makes my shake. Two thumbs up!"
2,Motor burns out within months,This blender works great the first few months and then the motor just dies out.I called Oster and they were defensive and not helpful at all. After checking reviews of this blender on other sites I see this is a very common problem. I mentioned this to Oster and they denied this. My small appliance repair man said they gave up on trying to fix this Model. Do not buy The Oster Fusion blender.
1,Good until it wasn't,"I bought this blender to replace my oster beehive which died after 3 years of use. This product claims to have an all metal drive but after 29 days of use the piece that the blade connects to on the base BROKE OFF. It was the exact same thing that happened to the beehive. Thank goodness it hadn't been the next day and I would have had to eat the cost. Buy once, cry once. I got a blendtec and couldn't be happier."
1,WAAAAYYY TOOOO EXPEN$$$VE,"After seeing the negative reviews and plus a friend just got one, worked well for a week, then KaPut! Only then I became hesitant to buy this power house way to Exp$$$ blender. Oster blenders are usually durable and perform well no matter how much they are. NOT THIS ONE! EXCELLENT SHIPPING THO! lol that deserves A STAR! Amazon Keep Up The Good Work!"
4,"An emotional journey, guided by an emotional voice.",Stina Nordenstam has created an intelligent album with an exceptionally personal touch. The scene of the music is rather gloomy but conveys something real and honest. The lyrics have been used by actors throughout Europe and appear very convincing both on paper and in voice. Listen and feel something.
5,Who COASTDA really is,"I, for one, thought the book was true to the account. Especially of what Ulys Stapleton and Josh Marquis were telling the public in Newport Oregon at the time. As a long time resident of Newport, to this day I'm appalled at the lack of responsibilty on the part of these two men and this book brought all that back to life. COASTDA is one of them, the latter if I'm not mistaken. In fact, I think it's pathetic that his only recourse is to attack Gerry Spence in this forum after already FAILING in all other attempts to bar him from speaking his piece in this case. I say to these men only, it's been 19yrs...isn't it time to grow up and take responsibility for your actions?"
1,Not Quite a True story,"Gerry Spence takes huge liberties with what actually happened in Oregon in 1985 when his clients were accused of shooting a man Spence grandly describes as a""real estate developer"" to death.The book will be a treat only for fans of the Buckaroo Bannister. Anyone who knows the actual events will find little to recognize"
5,"A ""MUST"" Read",Spence's latest book about two murder trials in Oregon chillingly details what can happen to anyone who is caught in the sights of overzealous prosecutors. This book is a great read -- an insider's view as to the strategies of a very talented lawyer who clearly cares about his clients.
4,Goodstuff,"I mean i bought this lasts night and i must say its pretty good. Its one of those cds that you just sit and chill to in your room and think about everything around you. Or atleast it does that to me. But if you are looking at buying it i picked a copy up at Best Buy and they had it for ( $12) so i def def suggest checkin your local one out. I asked the guy why it was so cheap and he was like ""i dunno"" so im not going to complain."
2,....another hit.... and miss,"Really really disappointing! If you looking for something similar to Gatecrasher Discotech set or Global Sound System, you won't find it in this one. This one is very dark, heavy, pounding tek-trance style. Although mixing is pretty good, on the other hand it's a lot easier to mix heavy trance. For those of you who really liked the Discotech set, skip this one, save youself disappointment and money."
5,utterly superb mix of heavy techno and trance bliss,"There are heavy techno dance disks; there are trancier blissouts... though the quiet disk 3, which is like Pink Floyd on ecstasy is pretty much up there; but this collection moves beyond Gatecrashers more commercial tendencies into a more blissed out drift, which has moments of such sweetness, whilst not compromising on relentless beat. It is a desert island disk. A must have. I couldn't live without it.Highlight cuts include;Universal State of Mind's ""All Because of You""... slow trance build into bliss, with the growing rising beat... pure heavenBassmen's ""Sending SOS""... picking up on the euphoric elements of the Police track ""Message in the Bottle""DJ Wag's ""Life on Mars""... a dark foreboding intense dance trip across the universeMauro Picotto's ""Bangkok""... with Picotto's normally extraordinary insistent pounding beat"
5,Great set of music!,"I'm new to the Trance scene but while I was in Hobart, Tasmania, A DJ turned me on to this CD set. It hasn't left my CD player in 3 weeks! I absolutely love this! also try Gods Kitchen."
5,Informative and Helpful,"I am finding How to Keep Kosher a valuable tool to explain and de-mystify the how tos and whys of keeping kosher. This book is a must read for a Jew by choice, or a Jew wanting to live a more kosher life.Lise Stern explains the process of kashering a kitchen, something which may seem very over whelming. I appreciate that she acknowledges how work intensive the kashering process can be, but as she explains the reasons for keeping kosher, it becomes more achieveable and worthwhile."
4,"""Kosher for Dummies""--and that's a good thing","This book is a clear, informative, comprehensive, and flexible guide for creating a kosher life. With this in hand, you can make decisions that fit your own inclinations toward keeping kosher, to whatever extent you might wish to. The book explains all the basic elements and offers a comparison among several branches of Judaism. It is not a rabbinic text, but a practical and useful one which also recommends consultation with one's rabbi of choice. It also provides some information on the food rituals of Succot, Passover, Chanukah, Shabbat, and High Holy Days.In the back of the book is a helpful glossary, a selection of recipes, some tied to holidays, and a number of very useful web resources. Depending on your interest and commitment, this may not be the only book on the subject you will ever want, but it's a great introduction or refresher course, and will come in very handy."
5,Easy to understand,"Converting my kitchen to a kosher kitchen, conservative laws. This explained exactly how to do that in simple to follow guidelines. I asked my Rabbi about it before purchasing it, and he ordered a copy and thought it was great. It is also nice because it gives you some history as well as recipes."
4,Good fun,"Ken Loach's excellent eye for humour, which can go missing from time to time, is well to the fore in this highly enjoyable film. Of course the socialist indignation is never far from the surface, and if there is one criticism, it would be that the left's version of regional stereotypes is alittle too obvious. But there are many nice human touches and enough substance to amke this a film worth viewing more than once."
3,Not bad for an Indy film,"As a fan of Robert Carlyle, I've been going back through his filmography & watching whatever I can find. I think this was one of his first movies and it was pretty good for an independent film. It's kind of rough around the edges & the story is on the darker side, but well worth seeing. In fact, I wish more of his earlier work was available...some titles are almost impossible to find."
2,Good film ruined through subtitles,"Intrusive, unnecessary and inaccurate subtitles block the image and completely ruin this film."
4,A good collector book,"This book would be handy for those Sackett folks. It is not what I was expected, however, When I start purchasing the Sackett collection it will be a good investment. I started a collection of Louis Lamour in my kindle and will be filling it pretty soon.Martin"
4,It was initially hard to figure out how to use this book.,"I realized quickly that this book contains information I did not want to know BEFORE I read a Sackett novel. So I carefully read the appropriate chapter after I am finished with a particular book and avoid other pages so as not be ""spoiled"" for those I have yet to read. The book gives a lot of insight into the mind of Louis L'Amour which is fun.It is laid out very nicely and I am glad to have it as a companion."
4,MAD Sackett Fan,"The book (bought used) arrived in superb condition and in a timely manner. The book itself however was a bit of a disappointment. Instead of a book brimming with Sackett lore, mystic and legend; you find instead précis info on the sacketts, most of which we already know of, from reading the various books.One saving grace of the book however, is the family tree links it displayed. Though woe-fully incomplete, it is at least helpful in sorting out the lineage of the characters we have read about and romanticized."
2,Looking for an intro to Tantric practice? look elsewhere...,"Just a warning to those of you who may be looking for an introduction into the actual practice of Tantra...This book is part of the ""World of Art"" series. It is very academic in nature, and can be quite dry. I must say that it would probably be a great asset for someone studying art history or history of religion. It is just NOT by any means a ""how-to"" manual, or an easy read. As the previous reviewer stated, it does not concentrate on the sexual/spiritual aspects of tantra."
3,Light Needs to be Brighter,"I bought this light for a night light in my kids room. Although they like the fact that it changed colors, it wasn't bright enough in the room for the light to be effective. I like the changing colors but for the money I could have gone and got a small lamp for my purpose. If you are looking for color, you have the right light. If you are looking for one light to lightly illuminate a dark room you made need two or save your money and go to Walmart."

4,A good start,"Having only about 140 pages, I wouldn't call this 'The Definitive Guide'. Even though I read it cover to cover and mod_rewrite is a relatively small subject, there are still some unanswered questions.Still, the book contains easy to read explanations, a quick primer on Regular Expressions, recipes, and - very important - examples of problems that should NOT be solved with mod_rewrite because there is an easier way to do it.So for those that are no experts yet and thus far had to consult the (not very user-friendly) official documentation on the Apache website, this book is certainly a good introduction."
5,Great for programmers AND webmasters!,"This book is perfect for programmers AND webmasters! Before reading this book I had very limited knowledge of what mod rewrite was or how it worked. After I finished it I was able to:1. Make search engine friendly URLs (dynamically generated by my site) work.2. Block bad bots and remote file inclusion attempts.3. Rename pages or move them seamlessly.I would recommend this book to anyone, it was easy to understand even from the point of view of someone just starting out."
3,Just read the online documentation,"I was very disappointed with this book. The information inside is so basic and cursory that you're bound to quickly run into situations more advanced than the contents can cover.For instance, it doesn't deal at all with using a rewritemap within a rewritecond, and it only gives one small paragraph to rewritecond backreferences. I've spent the last few weeks scouring the internet for details about mod_rewrite, and there's very little documentation.This book, at most, aggregates that documentation in one place. To call it the ""definitive guide"" is a bit much."
5,Great shoes,I ordered for my son for Christmas . ...he loves them ..I didn't know the left sole was different from the right but one is for gripping and one for sliding
1,What Happened?,"I thought he could have done alot better in the writing of this book. The story line seemed like it was created by a average joe than the Foster we have come to know. It was to elementry in story line and did not seem to want to move with the flow. This is the reason i gave it 1 star. Come on Foster, i know that there is better work than that in you."
4,Great book,"I thought this was a really good book. The plot was great, and the scenes and settings were too. This book was an alien encounter book with puzzles. To the reviewer who thought that this book was very similar to a computer should perhaps know that the book is based on a computer game. The game was also pretty good."
5,Wonderful!,"Foster did a great job on the book. Not a detailed translation of the game, though as good as the game itself. Whether you're searching for the meaning of life or just willing to have plain old fun, this book is for you, and owners of the game should not miss it by any means. The only scene which should have been worked on was the pre-ending scene: how couldn't the very advanced beings see the Eye as obviously as Low did and pass through it, after being there for a thousand years? Foster should have given a better excuse."
5,Camarillo student Digs this book.,"This book is a nice piece of science-fiction. The Dig has all the characteristics of a space opera with enough information to keep your feet on the ground along with enough mysterie to keep you holding the book in your hands instead of putting it down for a break everyonce and a while. However there was one draw back, this entire book was based on a computer game! I played the game befor I read the book and I ended up with not enough surprise to keep my eyelids open, The entire expierence was almost ruined for me if it wasn't for Foster's originality. I would recomend this book for whoever hasn't played the game. It is a very mysterious novel that is definately a five-star. I hope I see more of Alan Dean Foster."
5,Best book ever!!,"I loved this book, it was packed with action, intensity, suspense, and a little romance too! The idea was totaly cool! I cried at the end of the book and it was a huge helper for me because I have the game for my CPU. Hats off to Alan Dean Foster, and all the workers at LucasArts!"
3,So-so for Foster. Reads like a plot for a computer game.,"This is only so-so for Foster. Most of his work is much better. However it still exceeds most other writers.About half way through the book I begin to think I was playing Myst because the story has the same kind of go - explore - discover, go - explore - discover,- pick up magic stick which you will need to 1) fight a monster, or 2) save a life type of plot.However it did sustain me through a 4-hour plane ride"
5,Better than other sci-fi books!,"When I bought the book just for game cheats, I thought that the book would be boring, but it was the best sci-fi book I've ever read. The book starts out slow and boring, then gets more exciting. I got a little confused at the end, but got the idea. At the same time, I was playing the game, The Dig, by LucasArts Entertainment Company. The book only helped me a little with the game, though.()"
2,A Cosmic Letdown,"Foster is great at painting images of NASA, the Senate, and the workings of a shuttle mission. He goes even further with surprising the reader with the looks of the inside of the mysterious asteroid, and the grand climax of the asteroid sailing away at the speed of light to an alien planet called Cocytus.<P Some things are over explained, while others remain understated. And while Brink and Boston Low remain true to the game, Maggie has turned characterwise from a serious, no-nonsense, self-reliant reporter to a giggling, silly high school senior.The descriptions of the ancient alien machinery is uninspired, and the beauty of the world that comes across in the game is noticeably absent. Brink's crystal madness is understated, and instead of becoming a raving, screaming madman, as he does in the game, he sort of states that he has a problem with Boston Low and lets it go at that. I was extremely disappointed in this book."
4,The game translated well into a book...,"I didn't realize that the book was based on a game until after I had listened to it on tape. A group go off to blow a hole in an asteroid so it doesn't hit earth, but they find more than they bargained for. Sort of like Alice they fall thru the rabbit hole into a strange world - what will happen next? Are the Cocytens alive or just a prerecorded memory? And will they ever get home? The audiobook is read by John Shea, who does an excellent job. He has a soothing reading voice and does great characterizations. I listened to it twice and enjoyed it both times."
5,fun and learning with the tye dye care bear with blow pen,The bear itself is a great toy for little children and the blow pens make it more fun and the children learn to color in areas:)Wonderful product for little ones
5,Healing the Trauma of Domestic Violence,This book is great for Clinicians and Educators! I recommend that every domestic violence agency have one available for employees.
4,Charming,"A thoroughly enjoyable New York story of family, romance, and food, not necessarily in that order. The only thing I found confusing was the point of view. It drove me crazy that Julia's Grandma Ida was referred to as such and her Uncle Jay was referred to as such, but that her mother was always referred to as ""Sondra."" Did they think if they referred to her as ""Mom"" it would be too juvenile? I thought the references to the mother by her first name was ridiculous, and it put a huge distance between me and the characters every time I read it.I guess nobody's perfect."
2,No Love in the Details,"The love at Zabar's premise was a good one, but details didn't ring true. Talking about the bagel guy putting the bagels in platic bags? Yuck! Paper bags for bagels, always. ""What flavor bagel would you like?"" Oy. Better: ""What kind of bagel?"" The family that owns the place never eats the food? That's a major part of the plot and seemed totally unbelievable. The main character lives on donuts and Cheerios? No skinny NYC girl would do that -- especially one whose family runs Zabar's. She even takes a donut into the bathroom to snack on while she does her hair. Who does that??? Characters referring to the IRT line -- haven't heard that in NY in 20+ years. I'm sorry, I couldn't get past it."
3,Good if you have money to spare...,"I only noticed very little difference in using this sonicare model and my old manual toothbrush...not enough to run out and spend $100.00 on another bursh next time.Cons: 1.) Toothbrush is quite noisy.2.) Don't toss your manual toothbrush away, the Ni-Cd battery in this sonicare handle takes 24 hrs. for a full charge!"
3,Contains a nickel cadmium battery,"The Sonicare toothbrushes contain nickel cadmium batteries. The Sonicare manual says they ""must be recycled or disposed of properly""."
3,Sonicare no longer recycles the batteries,I think this model has been discontinued. Mine lasted about 5 years. It seemed like a decent electric toothbrush except that crud would collect in the handle- gross. The new FlexCare model solves this.I would give the brush 4 stars except that it turns out Sonicare no longer sends you a postage-paid mailer to recycle the batteries. I'd recycle them myself except they're impossible to remove from the housing and I hurt my hand trying. These older models use NiCad so they really should be recycled.
3,Should last longer,"My Sonicare Elite lasted 2 or 3 years. The cover came off of the on/off switch. That means that water can get in and ruin the electronics. It hasn't failed yet only because I stopped using it. I contacted Phillips support on line chat. Nice people, but no offer to replace the unit. Obviously it is out of warranty, but this type of failure should not happen until past 5 years. [...]Please note that Sonicare will protect your teeth and it is money well spent."
2,watch the button,"one year after my purchase, the top button made of rub wore away. so, water can flow into side! Then, the switch randomly worked for electric problem inside. I'd to seal the cleft on the button with tape, but no way to get back to normal function. now this brush seems useless to me.Try to protect the button with particular care."
4,Nice tooth brush ever.,I've used this product for a long time and I really feel good whit this tooth brush. It greatly remove all dirty things in my mouth and easy to unse and brush.What a Good Product !!!
1,Arghh!!! 3 went bad within a year!!!,"I have used the Sonicare brand toothbrush forever it seems, I loved this thing and every time i put on a new brush head it was that great feeling you can't get from a regular toothbrush. But I have no idea what is going on as I have had to replace 3 of these in less than 1 years time. The first time I thought it was a fluke but after 3 times I am wondering what the heck brand of batteries are in these things. I was about to throw out the 3rd one until i pressed the button and held it down as if I were resetting it and it worked, but I need to do that EVERY time now. Done with sonicare going to try Oral B."
2,Thought it was great. Now I know better.,"I used the Sonicare Elite for several years, buying the hype that it was cleaning my teeth better than I could. But then my dental hygienist pointed out that it was also brushing away the base of my gums with its back-and-forth action--she showed me the linear ridges it has made in my gums. I don't apply alot of pressure when brushing, so this was upsetting, especially since the damage is permanent. She'd been trying to get me to switch to the Oral B for ages, so when my sister-in-law (also a hygienist) recommended the Oral B, I went out and got one. The circular action doesn't wear away the gum line, and my teeth are significantly cleaner. Even though I floss every day, I still had plaque build-up behind my bottom front teeth with the Sonicare. With the Oral B, it's gone. And with the variety of brushing styles that automatically switch when you change a brush head (several options are included!), it's a lot more bang for your buck."
4,Worth Every Penny,"At first I thought that maybe spending $100 on a toothbrush seemed liked a lot, but then I realized that these are my teeth and I want to have them forever. I've only used the brush for a couple days but I already love it. I had a problem with over-brushing before but now with this new Sonicare I can barely feel the brush on my teeth, but my teeth feel really really clean afterwards. The brushheads are a little expensive but if you're only replacing them every 6 months, it's really not that big of a deal."
1,did not work out of the box,"First we purchased an e7300.The timer did not work and the unit would turn itself off repeatedly.Called Sonicare who confirmed it did not work and I replaced it with an e5300.The timer did not work and the unit would turn itself off repeatedly.Called Sonicare who confirmed it did not work and I took it back for a refund this time.I suppose these are good toothbrushes. I've been using Sonicare for a bit over 10 years and never had any problems other than poor battery life. However, the above experience suggests they have some bad electronics or brush heads in the distribution pipeline.Or, now that Sonicare is owned by Phillips, quality has been compromised. It certainly was in the last razor I purchased."
4,great toothbrush,I have been using this brush for over 3 years and my dental checkups have been great and I noticed whiter teeth after using for 3-4 months. My only problem with the brush is that the battery died after 3 years and I had to buy another one as there was no way to replace the battery. Other than that a great product that does what it says it does.
5,Whiter teeth,"My dentist recommended this product since I had some gum recession. As an extra bonus to helping my gums, my teeth are definitely whiter and shine after brushing. I'm very pleased with this product. It is very expensive as are the replacement heads. The only complaint I have is that when you replace the toothbrush in the charger, it must be seated precisely to charge, otherwise it keeps blinking causing you to return to make sure it's seated correctly. You'd think that this task could have been made easier with all the technology available."
5,Great toothbrush! Well worth the money,"I had purchased this model from a recommendation of friend/dentist after being quite unhappy with another electric toothbrush purchase. Even after the first night of usage, I noticed a difference in the cleanliness of my teeth.My kids, who both have a mouthful of braces, use this toothbrush as well and both love it. Their orthodontist has even made comments on how clean their teeth were. That's enough to make any parent happy."
3,"Great Product, Horrible Packaging",I have used Sonicare for years. It produces wonderful results in dental hygiene. I just received this new model. The entire package is encased in an impenetrable hard-plastic clamshell with no way to get in. You will need cutting tools and gloves. Be careful you don't damage the Sonicare or your hands when wrestling with this devilish and unnecessary covering. I didn't wear gloves and cut my hand on one of the razor-sharp plastic edges. 5 Stars for the Sonicare itself; 1 Star for the Packaging producing the 3 star result.
1,Go Broke,"This toothbrush does a fair job when the brush heads are new; however, they get ""mushy"" rather quickly and at $12.50 each you will go broke replacing them! I have purchased a Braun Oral-B Triumph to replace it and it has been a much more economical alternative and functions just as well, if not better."
3,Great polish but annoying tickling vibration & no deep clean feeling,"This toothbrush is great for making your teeth shine as if you came right from the dentist. The problem is that it works by vibrating its head rapidly which makes for an uncomfortable & tickley brushing experience. Also, it feels like it doesn't do well to get in between teeth. I'm currently in the process of finding out what the model name and manufacturer of my previous electric toothbrush was so I can go and buy that one again.Edit: I found it and its just as amazing as I remembered it. It's the Conair Interplak toothbrush! It doesn't tickle, it gets in between teeth and makes them shine, and it removes the need for dental floss! I'm SOOO happy I found it again!"
4,Feels cleaner,"It works pretty good, not as good as everyone out there made it seem ... my teeth def. feel a lot cleaner, but I don't think they are when I look in the mirror ... one good thing is the timer ... it ensures I clean my entire mouth for the full dentist recommended time period. Plus I don't feel as lazy since it feels like less work when brushing.Good buy."
1,Don't away your money!,"I got this product in 9/2008. It worked well but only for about a year. About a year after I got it, the edge around the green power button on the handle began to crack. Now the crack has almost made a complete circle around the button. All this time, it was still functional so I didn't give it much thought about replacing it. Today it just died completely and it has not even been two years yet. My old Sonicare Essence lasted quite a few years without any glitch until the batteries would not hold charge any more. I would go back to the Essence but I am definitely not getting another fanicer model of Sonicare."
4,Sonicare Elite 7300e,"A great electric toothbrush. Does a terrific job of leaving teeth feeling clean. However, it has only four 30-second cycles per use. For the slightly greater price I would recommend the model that has five 30-second cycles so that it is possible to clean the chewing surfaces of the back teeth without having to turn it on again."
5,ABSORBING,Absorbing book. Lots of adventure; twists and turns. I have purchased the rest of the series as I rreally like continuing stories.
4,decent book,"This is the first Thomas Perry novel I have read. The story is good and moves quickly and I enjoyed the strong lead female Jane. I enjoyed learning about Native Americans. I however got annoyed with some inaccuracies about surviving in the woods. For example the author writes that she was surviving on blackberries in May, not possible, maybe the strawberries still a stretch and deer go into the rut in the fall not the spring. Good book but more research could have been done."
5,"Fascinating premise, interesting character - kept me reading","Ever wondered how people disappear intentionally? Read this book and find out. Jane Whitfield is an interesting character and a bit of a rarity among male authors - she's a woman who lives a very different life and makes no apologies for it. She helps people in genuine trouble - not criminals running from the law - disappear into new lives. This book kept me reading until the end, despite disappointment in Whitfield's decision to help the person who comes to her at the beginning of the book with a rather unlikely story. Perhaps her need to believe is part of her character. Hopefully future books will explore her reasons for her unusual ""occupation"" - she doesn't take money for her work, it turns out"
4,Another terrific read from Perry,"As strained as the premise may be, Perry makes Jane Whitefield and her adventures (and misadventures as in ""Vanishing Act"") come to life - a compelling read. As in many Perry novels there are certain ruminations that go on a bit too long but that's why they make books out of pages - just keep turning until she is back in action. On the other hand, Jane's somewhat mystical connections to her Native American past are intriguing - a shot of anthropology and history. No reason to spoil the plot other than to say that her Native American roots allow for Jane's ingenious solutions to the various obstacles placed in her way. Western NY is an unlikely setting but in a sense, it grounds the rather implausible plots. All in, Perry writes well and provides enough twists to keep you reading. 4-stars versus 5 only because of my feelings about the over-long digressions. A 5-star review otherwise."
3,Unbelievable but entertaining.,"I enjoyed reading this book, although the story line is unbelievable. Often, I would put the book down and say to myself: ""No way"". The main character is interesting and original, it would make a good movie. The information about native people is the best part of the book. This was my first Thomas Perry book and I will go back to him again."
2,disappointing,"A heroine who's half white, half Seneca, and helps criminals ""disappear"" is inexhaustibly energetic but not too bright, it turns out. The plot alternates between long passages of exposition and fairly good sections of flight/pursuit writing. The ""Indian lore"" scattered around the pages--well, if you take that seriously I have a bridge to sell you. I read this on the recommendation of a friend, and was grievously disappointed; I felt manipulated by the author in bad ways."
4,Good Read,"This book has good suspense, with a surprising twist. It is hard to put down. The attention to every small detail that provides clues is so interesting. This is a great read."
2,at least the beginning is lively,"It all starts good and interesting, however, the plot is centered around dumb actions of the good girl and on otherwise unfounded expectations of the bad guy that she will do exactly these stupid things, it is so annoying that it is almost impossible to read this book once you realize this."
2,Figured out the plot in 50 pages,"Trite. Obviously a continuing character, so maybe other books were better. Figured out the plot in 50 pages, and nothing changed. Wondered how the heroine could be so stupid. (Maybe other books were better - this was the 1st one I'd read). If you watch ""Mystery"" on PBS or other mysteries on A&E, you'll have figured out the whole plot really early and can spend the rest of the book figuring out how the heroine can be so dumb!I read a lot! That mean I read a lot of bad books, too, although I try to limit them as best as I can. This book doesn't make it for me."
2,started good,I could not finish this book.It started out so promising but I found all the detail about the American Indians distracting and so i got bored and quit reading it.When i find myself skimming through parts of a book to read faster then i know I shouldn't read any further.I hate quitting a book but I just couldn't get past all the detail about the native history. Some would find this interesting but i didn't.I might try this author again...
3,It is not like that in the north woods,"The heronine is out in the north Woods in early spring. No food or dry clothing and is able to make a working bow and a set of arrows in a day!!! give me a break, this is too far from reality. All in all it was an adventure albeit a bit slow at times."
3,Above Average,"This is a decent thriller. However, it drags in spots and when he goes through a stream of concious for several pages, it gets really convoluted. A clean straight forward thriller would have been better."
5,"Excellent,engrossing,could not put it down!",First book I read of Thomas Perry..can't wait to get more of his work in. Could not put the book down.I'm a readaholic so have many authors whom I've come to know..he's one of the best!
5,A well-guided tour through the decade from hell.,"Thompson at his sardonic best. From Ollie North through Reagan -- Thompson excorcises the horrors of greed, stupidity and mindless, unchecked power that mark the decade we'd most like to forget."
1,Garbage,"Trite, overblown, and redundant. Hunter S. Thompson proves that even ""biting social commentary"" can become stale with age."
3,Maybe drugs finaly caught up to him...,"Book was good but I didn't enjoy it as much as ""The Great Shark Hunt... Gonzo 1"". Articles in book seemed forced, short...Disapointing? Anyway, worth reading, just don't expect too much."
2,"What a long, strange trip its been","Before he burned himself out on drugs, Hunter Thompson was perhaps the best and certainly most vicious humor writer in America. Unfortunately, by the time the 1980s rolled around, Thompson had lost a few miles-an-hour off his fastball and could no longer knock 'em dead like he used to. Though you can still delight at the occasional potshot at those in power (like his description of George Bush senior as ""the mean, preppie vice president""), overall he fails to consistently produce the kind of cutting satire that he could in his prime. It was almost as if he had come to personify the ""Uncle Duke"" character by which Gary Trudeau had been lampooning him for all these years. Sadly, we must use his own words to report that the master has ""cashed his check."""
1,His Worst Collection of Tripe,"This collection of 100 or so newspaper columns is probably the worst material I have read of Thompson's. First of all, it starts OK, but then turns into a liberal rant for the last half of the book. In almost all cases, Thompson's wild and repeated predictions about the fall of Republicans never come to pass. In fact, not one of them came true.It is a shame that a man with such insidious ability to write from the gut would allow himself to slide into the dark, slimy Left side of politics, all the while failing to report-much less admit-that the Left was as much if not more corrupt than the Right.I would pass this tome of incoherent bloviating. His other works are far superior to this wasted cache of paper."
2,unsure,I found this very difficult to read because of the long run-on sentences. Unfortunately I was not able to finish reading the book because of the author's writing style.
1,one long boring sentence,"Our book club picked this; we are a group of professionals with a median age of ~45. None of us liked it. Too many run on sentences, too many thoughts and ideas falling all over the place. We decided maybe someone in their early 20's who's grown up on the computer might like this. It read like an IM or email."
3,"Not what I thought, but ok.","I found myself rushing through this just to get done with it. It was boring to me. I would have rather her concentrate on one section of her life. I understand what the author was trying to do, but to me, it didn't turn out that great."
1,Another Castro Apologist,"Johnathan Kozol lionizes the dictatorship set up by Fidel Castro in Cuba. Yes, Mr. Kozol, Castro has a great school system in Cuba which teaches everyone to read...and Castro then thoughtfully decides which books they can read. What kind of fools do you think we are?"
5,Excellent album,"Julie Miller's BLUE PONY album is truly amazing, from start to finish. The opener ""A Kiss On The Lips"", is a rockin little tune that will have you reaching for the repeat button. I find her lyrics to be very introspective and true speaking, especially on reflective ballads like ""Give Me An Ocean"" or ""Blue Pony"". Songs like ""Dnacing Girl"", ""All The Pieces of Mary"", ""Take Me Back"" and ""The Devil is an Angel"" will have you singing along. There's a good variety of music here, including country, americana, blues, roots, and more. Her unique vocals combined with the strength of the lyrics bring the songs alive, a listening experience like no other. Give BLUE PONY a try!"
2,I don't get it.,"If you like listening to women singers with annoying, little-girl voices, this CD is for you. I bought the CD because I'm an Emmylou Harris fan, and I noticed that, according to Amazon, people who bought some of Harris's CDs also bought Miller's. After listening to Blue Pony, I don't understand why."
5,Quintessential American fusion........,"I don't have strong enough words to use in describing what a fantastic album this is.Julie Miller's ""Blue Pony"" covers the range of the roots of America's musical history, form Rock, Folk, Country and Celtic all the way to Blues.Give this a close listen folks. Rarely do we get to hear a recording that embodies so much mucical passion.Julie and her husband Buddy are a treasure trove in American Music, and, as such, too well kept of a secret.Buy 2, and prepare to want to give this album to everyone you care about!!"
1,Very Bad REcording of CD,"I love this album, it's one of my favorites. Had it for years on cassette until it broke. Bought this CD and it does NOT play correctly. You would think it was recorded by a small child at home on a cheap computer. It is useless. I love the music so much I am re-ordering it. Hopefully it was only one copy. If not I plan to challenge Amazon's ""no music returned"" policy. Heads up, Amazon!"
2,Over rated by reviewers,"I hate to throw water on the gushing party for this album, but I don't agree with the reviewers here. Some have said that this album was under rated. If it did get mediocre ratings and have soft sales it was for a good reason.I just converted my old LP to digital and I'm wondering why I bothered. I didn't listen to the album much when it first came out and now I can see why. It doesn't hold up well.Yes, it's well produced and the performances are top notch. The songs, however, are bland pop music. I guess they were hoping to cash in with this album going for some middle-of-the-road audience.Manhattan Transfer has done some great and interesting work, this just isn't part of that. They were far more interesting when they stuck closer to jazz. There's little here that makes me take notice."
4,Great for hand and machine sewing - beginners should buy,"I loved the hand sewing tips and advice in this book. I used this book with John Flynn's Double Wedding Rings (his pattern varies and has less pieces in the archs - we're learning, less pieces are best at this time) and we are having great results. Good reference."
2,Water resistant Not Proof,I bought this to go on a cruise as I know I needed something as we would be in the pool and at the beach. After using it a couple of time it started to not close. We have 2 of these and both had the same problem and everything got wet!
5,I use it all the time,"Whenever I go somewhere that I don't want to bring my purse, I use this.I bought another lanyard with a keyring on it, because the clasp on the one that comes with it isn't very reliable. It kept coming undone in my pocket.I haven't tested it on any water rides yet, but for every day activities where cash would normally get a little wet, this holds up. I use it for theme parks, football games (which, it's WONDERFUL for). I tie the lanyard around my belt loop and put the holder in my pocket and I'm not worried about it at all.I'm glad I chose the men's size instead of the women's because my credit cards & cash fit just right, and they're still easy enough to take out."
1,Water Actracting Holder,"I used this product for surface level snorkeling and was extremely disappointed: 1) it filled up with water after only 15 minutes in the water and 2) the plastic holder came off of the clasp during snorkeling (luckly, I noticed it floating near me when I stoped to clear my mask). Referring to this product as 'waterproof' is criminal as everything I placed in the holder was saturated with water; even after dumping it out and resealing throughout the day it continued to fill up with water. In addition, this product is overpriced as a snorkeling mate found a truly waterproof holder at a dollar store that kept his contents perfectly dry throughout the day."
2,not quite concise,"Like the title, it isn't concise.The author writes too much theorems and postulates that are obvious to know.However, I'm not saying that it is bad; it is the best geometry review book.But if Mr. Kohn deletes these obvious theorems, I would love this book."
5,great for reviewing,I am involved with tutoring and haven't looked at geometry for MANY years. I am using Cliff's for review and to supplement more in-depth material. I am finding it great for bringing back the material.
1,hippy nonsense at its finest,"all kinds of gobbley gook and nothing remotely useful. her ""knowledge"" consists of things like ""mix in a little bloodmeal"". amateur growers would do well just to throw their seeds into the back garden and hope for the best, rather than waste time with garcia's brand of tripe."
1,not worth it,I thought I was getting a set as that is what the tag line said - The best of dyer cd SET. I got only one cd. This is not a set.
5,Strange Generation ~ Dirty Americans,"This is not historically my type of music, but I love the album. I love the group, just wish they had not changed their name from Workhorse Movement. They are an excellent group, and appear to be getting mentored by some of the classic GREATS. Freedom (Jeff Piper) is one of the best guitarists this country has seen in a long time. It's great to see young men from my home town make it. Doesn't hurt to be related to one of them either."
3,Very nice ... now what do I do with it?,"The dyna disc was delivered promptly and the price was very reasonable. However there were no instructions - zilch. Not even any info abont inflating/deflating it. Would be nice if the manufacturer would include a page of simple instructions, exercise tips, etc."
3,good turn around,quick delivery except there were no directions to follow. I only have the exercises from my physical therapist. Kind of a bummer.
5,Connects to other OVO habitrail systems,"As pointed out in the other review - these are not designed to go with the crittertrail systems. It does connect to the other OVO habitrail systems, though.The attachments do click on to the other OVO sets, but not quite as easily as the larger OVO parts connect to each other. The interlocking rings are stiffer and more difficult to twist from the locked/unlocked positions. Just be careful they're really attached if you're mixing sets, so you don't have a tragic fall or escape on your hands, at the connection between other parts. Plastic is thicker and seemingly more sturdy than the other, older OVO habitrail connection parts."
4,Cheap and does the job.,"nothing special but it gives you something to carry papers, a pen and business cards. also has writing pad. I paid around $10."
4,I Appreciate the Reviews,"The previous reviews helped me decide to purchase the video. I am slow at any dance classes and I need to repeat and practice before I can feel comfortable in leading steps. I have wanted to learn the hustle for about 6 months bud did not have time to take any lessons. This tape enabled me to learn the moves and practice the leads. It is very helpful for me. Again, my sincere thanks to those previous reviewers."
1,humor is a major distraction,"The instructional part is ok, but the never ending corny humor is major distraction for anyone trying to concentrate on the steps. You could compare it to trying to watch a movie in a theater while the person behind you continuously makes jokes about the show. Do not buy this unless you absolutely can't find another hustle video. I'm sending mine back. What could have been a good instructional video is actually painful to watch. Very unprofessional."
5,A Must For Magnum Fans!,"Excellent audio and performance make this totally essential for a fan of Magnum. Recorded in 1982 in Tennessee on their Chase the Dragon tour supporting Ozzy. 2 songs appeared as bonuses on the CtD remaster....Great set list and tight performance. Cool art as well. Find it, but don't pay more than $20!"
3,This film was a little disappointing,While this film is somewhat dated I still found it interesting as Alan Ladd always gives a good performance in his films.
2,Lightweight but dreary,"This is an English police procedural starring Erkine Powell, a Scotland Yard Chief Inspector whose marriage is nearly on the rocks, who hates a boss who returns the favor, who is attracted to a lovely sergeant, and who is awash in two dimensional suspects of the murder of an unlovely victim. There is very little action, too much review of what we have learned so far, no humor and other than perhaps liking his lager too much, an unflawed hero. This is sort of in the Deborah Crombie genre but not written as well or appealingly. If you are stuck for a book on an airplane, it will do, but that is about it."
3,Loose cap,"Good idea but drinking tray is a bit difficult to deploy. Biggest problem, the bottle is too soft and the cap threads do not hold well. Over tighten slightly and cap pops off. Weight of bottle can pull out of cap when suspended by strap. I don't think I would buy another one."
4,Wonderful product!!,"This ingenious product is exactly what I needed for my dog. She drinks a lot of water and it's been hard to find a way for her to drink. She would mostly drink from my hand, but this certainly resolves that problem! I love the product and will probably get another to stay in the car. However, returning leftover water back into the container is timely and not easy. So I suggest only pouring what you think your dog will drink. It's better to pour again than try to return it to the bottle. That keeps the water clean, too, in case I need a sip!"
1,Not worth it,Threads on cap don't hold under the weight of a full bottle. I used the straps and had 2 bottles let loose. The bowl is hard to use without strong hands. It's only use is to hold water in my car for use in another bowl.
3,don't waste your money,"great idea. can't lose any of the pieces since all connected. but the top doesn't stay on, while twisting shut, it hits a point where it opens again. leaked all over my bag. the strap is also connected to the top, by carrying by the strap you risk the bottom falling out."
3,great idea but significantly flawed execution,The problem with this water bottle is the overly brittle plastic used for the closure plug. It is very stiff and difficult to pull in and out. This morning one of the tabs that creates the finger hold for opening the spout broke off and cut my finger open as I tried to open the bottle. I agree with other reviewers that the plastic of the bottle itself is overly soft and creates a mismatch with the stiff brittle lid elements. It is a great idea but I'm not going to use it anymore.
1,poor design and waste of money,"I agree with the reviewer who claimed that the drinking tray is too difficult to use. It sounds good on paper, but twisting and then flipping the tray is a procedure that is not condusive with walking the dog as it takes time. I also experienced the problem with the cap not staying on the bottle. The threads don't hold it on and after two uses, the whole contraption was useless as it leaked all over the place. No amount of teasing, cajoling or expertise made this bottle work so I finally just threw it away. Waste of money for sure."
1,Leaky bottle,"The idea behind this water bottle is good with the flip out attached bowl, however, it leaks like crazy. The threaded rim of the bottle is not completely round so the cap does not screw on tightly.Waste of money!"
3,Portable Dog Water Bottle,"The bowl part of this product is a soft plastic that runs alongside and underneath one side of the water bottle. You pull it off and away from the bottle, and it forms a little boat; open the water bottle nozzle and squeeze the bottle and water pours out into the little boat/bowl. My dog uses it without any problem, and I can keep squeezing to refill as she drinks. Once she's finished, I slip the bowl back into its original position. Easy enough, but takes both hands to accomplish. Twice I have not gotten the lid correctly onto the bottle - leaked all over my front seat once, and the other time, the bottle slipped away from the lid, causing me to lose all the water on the walking trail. But that could simply be operator error. A good product that does what it is intended to do."
5,Water! Water! Water!,I like the fact that no matter where we may go my puppy will always have water. Love the sling for easy carrying.
2,The top leaks.,"It's a great idea but the pull up top leaks when pushed down to the closed position. I bought one a a local pet store and it leaked. They replaced it but the replacement leaked also. The clerk and I looked at all the ones they had and the tops were all suspect. If kept upright *should* be fine but otherwise, beware."
2,Don't leave it in a hot car!,"Bought this item and at first it was great, although I had some trouble folding out the bowl. But my dog loved it and it was convenient to take. Unfortunately, I live in Florida, where the heat in the summer gets to some fairly unbearable highs (hence me buying this for my dog in the first place). Anyway, I left the bottle in the back of my car while I went to PetSmart with my dog for about 45 minutes. When I came back to my car to retrieve the bottle, the bowl part of the bottle had melted itself into a completely useless form that wasn't able to hold water anymore. I ended up having to cut the bowl off the bottle and just bought myself a folding bowl to take along. I'm going to give Gulpy Pet a try and see if it fares any better... hopefully, it being hard plastic, it might retain its form."
2,"Flimsy, small, not for big dogs","The ""drinking dish"" is a piece of softer plastic that has to be turned inside out, creating KIND OF a bowl.Not worth it. Maybe for the emergency use when there is absolutely no other choice.I will continue bringing a big jug of water and her own dish to the park. My dog is not that big either, 50 or so lbs and the water held there would be enough for oh 1 or 2 drinks.Yes, they do specify 20 oz"
4,My shepherd loves it,"My big Aussie/German puppy loves this bottle! We hike almost every day and it became such a pain to lug around multiple water bottles for both her and I. I ordered one and i love it! The only drawback is that not too much water can be held in the container, about one regular sized water bottle. Another drawback is that it is pretty akward to carry around. I usually tie the strings attached to the water bottle onto her leash, long enough so I don't have to remove it every time she needs a drink and short enough so it's not dragging on the ground. All in all, it is worth the money and should be more considered by smaller dog owners, otherwise invest in 2!"
3,Thirsty Dog Portable Pet Water Bowl-20 Oz,"Hi. The Thirsty Dog Portable Pet Water Bowl is an ok product. I found that the plastic part that you fold down so the dog can drink out of it gets dirty very easily, so I cut it off, & my dog drinks out of the top. It also leaks if it's not kept upright. I hope this helps."
5,Handy Reference,This is a great little book that you can carry in your pocket. You can select from 72 angels from areas such as courage or patience. It really works.
5,nutrition superbook:the good fats and oils,"attention!,all fat-fighters,and health seekers.we need fats, it is a body's need,but this book is telling you what kind rather then just how much,and this book is telling you both things in a very simple yet deeper understanding of all the fats-kinds,molecular-shapes(that is understandable), and the actions and functions in the body, together with the right foods and the contents in those foods.there is also a section that tells you the reader about the diseases that those valuble fats are able to heal, and the book described them from the most leading reserchers from around the world. the only thing that maked me sad about this book is that if the knoledge that is represented in that book was published all together years before,then a lot of grief could be prevented. thank god we have that book. what about you?"
2,"Good Points, Wrong Conclusion","Keyes is a skilled and eloquent rhetorician, and much of his analysis of African-American communities is right on target. Unfortunately some of his conclusions seem illogical. While an intelligent argument can be made against the wellfare state, operating from the Republican party is nonsensical given it's historic opposition to civil rights.If Keyes' supposition is correct, that education and moral strenght are what lift people out of poverty, then welfare needs to be replaced with a monumental effort on the part of the federal government to provide equal funding and support to every school in every community. Republicans have consistently opposed equality in education, to the detriment of African-Americans and other minority groups.Keyes could further his cause much more effectively by working within the Democratic party which is much more inclusive and tolerant not only of racial diversity but of education and difference of ideas..."
4,Listen to this twice and you won't take it out of rotation.,"He has got some really great one liners in here. Intellegent lyrics, and good musicianship. It really is a good album. Everyone I have lent this out to has bought it for themselves when I demanded it back."
5,"A ""must have"" product for a better smile!","This is a great product. I travel, and it holds it charge all week when I am on the road without having to recharge. My Dentist visits are much easier to take now that I use this toothbrush since I have so few problems with my gums and teeth. My gums are actually much better than they were before I bought this product.I bought one for my Mom who has arthritis in her hands and has a hard time holding on to a smaller toothbrush. Now she can brush her teeth without any pain and her dentist tells her he can really tell the differnce.We both love this product and highly recommend it!"
2,5 stars until the battery ran out,"i'm a dentist and luckily we only stock oral-B in our office. why? many people i've talked to have had the same problem i had with the sonicare elite and that was the battery running out. i received mine free as a promotion anyhow, but i'm glad that i don't have to repeatedly answer 'why did you sell me an expensive piece of junk?' great toothbrush otherwise, i think that it cleans better than anything else out there."
5,Best Tooth Brush,"My dentist recommanded I buy this tooth brush. He said I was gonna be pricey but well worth it which I come to find out to be true!My teeth feel so much cleaner than brushing with a regular toothbrush. The 2 min. auto timer is just such a good feature, every 30 seconds it pauses to indicate for you to move on to the next sections of your mouth. And the battery life last so long! Fully charge it over night.. and don't have to chargeit again for 2 weeks! With it's traveling case, you can take it with you on vacations and not have to bring the charger!So it's a bit price... the next time you want to buy that pair of shoes, or that new gadget... don't. Instead, buy this toothbrush!"
3,Works very well...But,"Yes, this thing works as advertised and as well as the people who rave about it say. You should be warned the power put out by the motor in this thing has you feeling like you're brushing your teeth with a chain saw at first. Not to worry, you'll get used to it.Here's the 'But': When the rechargeable battery dies (in my case, after about two years of use), YOU CAN'T REPLACE IT -- you're stuck having to buy a whole new unit.Not wanting to believe this, I went to the Sonicare Website, and found precious little information and no apologies. All I found was an admonition to not attempt replacing the battery.Call me a tight wad, but I think having to replace a $100+ toothbrush every couple of years is a tad bogus.Philips/Sonicare, you need to correct this issue."
5,A great product,"I recently got braces. I told my dental care professional that I have difficulty flossing and brushing and he recommended the Sonicare product. This is my first time with an electric tooth brush and I must say that I have been missing out. The instructions for the product are clear and it is preset to ramp up the level of the brushing action to help beginners adjust. It is easy to grip, comfortably reaches all parts of my mouth and the timing mechanism is wonderful. Philips even offers (easy to set up) email remainders to let you known when it is time to change your tooth brush head. They have made this a very well engineered and easy to use product. I really feel like my teeth are cleaner than they every could be with manual brushing."
2,Cloddish replacements,"Be careful because you will waste time and money ordering replacement heads. You won't be able to tell what kind of toothbrush you have, because Philips doesn't indicate it on the toothbrush, so you have to guess when you reorder. Philips wins on this, but you lose."
2,Works well,"works very well, but its a freakin toothbrush, unless you have teeth problems dont spend$100+ dollars (or ur rich) i mean its really not that great or worth it, just get a $20 one instead if you want to blow your money..."
1,Sonicare Elite 7500 Toothbrush,This is my second Sonicare Toothbrush the first one lasted for five years of daily use. The new 7500 is much lighter and smaller which makes it easier to use and more effective in reaching all the surfaces of your teeth. I'm very pleased with the product and how well it removes plaque and food bits from between the teeth. My dentist always remarks about how little tarter I have during semiannual check ups and cleaning. I highly recommend this product.
1,Buy an Interplak! Save money and your teeth!,"Sonicare is FAR inferior to INTERPLAK brand electric toothbrushes with rotating bristles. Get the Interplak toothbrush with the rotating bristles, not the round ""Oral B"" style head.My family has used Interplak brand since the 1980's and we have had fantastic success - imagine cancelling your curettage appointment and reducing the number of cleaning visits you need...etc. (Don't tell my dentist that I don't floss - I just use my Interplak!) We tried a Sonicare & were horrified. These are overpriced and they don't leave your teeth with the same clean feeling you get with an Interplak."
2,"It broke, I tossed it","I bought this for more than $150 at my dentist. It worked well for about a year, though it does get pretty disgusting beneath the top half without fairly intensive cleaning.After about a year of use, however, the switch broke. It wouldn't turn off or on reliably. Now I'm SURE Philips would have happily replaced it under warranty. The problem is, I can't be bothered with a toothbrush that adds that much complexity to my life. An iPod breaking is bad enough, a $100 plus toootbrush breaking is the proverbial straw.It also didn't magically prevent the age related recession of my gums -- if it had I'd suffer the time drain. As it is, it's back to the old toothbrush. I'll spend the time I save dealing with the warranty on better gum care.It gets two stars because it does have a warranty, I just can't stand to deal with it."
1,Non-Replacable Batteries,"I bought my Sonicare about a year ago, and only used it maybe 6 months of that year. Batteries are dead, and completely non-replacable, toxic, and a pain in the ass to get to a recycling plant. I'll never buy another Sonicare product."
1,"good idea in theory, but. . . .","The use of ultrasound for this application sounds good in theory, but my two-year experience indicated that it did not work in practice. Plaque build-up was, if anything, worse than with manual brushing. It was only when I started to use the Oral-B 3-D Excel that we (my dentist and I) noticed an improvement."
1,Not worth the money,"If it were possible to give this toothbrush a 0, I would. It's a little pricey for a piece of junk that it is. A toothbrush that is way better is Cybersonic 2. It costs less than this toothbrush. It also offers more. The Sonicare Elite 7500 cleans at 31,000 strokes a minute, but Cybersonic 2 cleans at 41,000. Cybersonic 2 comes with a 2 tongue cleaner, 2 flosser attachments and 45 pre-strung flossing heads which are disposable, recharging stand, and best of all free replacement brushes every 3 months for free for ever. The Sonicare brushes cost more than $20. With the Sonicare brush you have to brush for 2 minutes and with the Cybersonic 2 you only have to brush for 1 minute and the brush pauses for a second to tell you that a minute has passed. Plain and simple, Cybersonic 2 is the best and most powerful toothbrush in the world. So if you want the best toothbrush, do not buy the Sonicare, buy Cybersonic 2. Check it out for yourself at Cybersonic2.com peace YO!!!!!"
1,This is a disposable toothbrush,"I was surprise to discovered all Sonicare toothbrushes are disposable item. Its battery cannot be replace what so ever. Like any other electronic products, its battery and IC board are toxic and can only be dispose by your local electronic waste program. Mine lasted about 6 months, at this rate...we're going to end up tones of these in our landfill. It is irresponsible to produce products like this. If I had known about this I would never have bought it.Forget about this hi-tech marketing stuff. Use a regular toothbrush and get your teeth clean regularly is the best prevention."
3,Sonicare old and new,"I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for about six years and I loved it. I can even do without floshing with the Sonicare. But I was using the old one, i.e. the 4100. Recently my beloved 4100 is breaking down. I can switch it on, sometimes pressing several times to do so; but I can't switch it off. I have to wait until the two minutes is up. So I bought a new one. First the battery operated one, then the new 7100. I found them both unbearable. They are very noisy and very rough. I don't know it's just me or what. It just doesn't make sense. The old one is so gentle and quiet, but the ""advanced"" new one is so rough. Am I missing something? I would like to have the company to explain why they ""improve"" a good product in such a way."
4,Sonicare,"Again, I have to complain about the shipping. I found a product that I love, but find it a pain to have it shipped to an APO address. Basically, I pay for shipping twice...once to a friend in the US and again when they ship it to my APO address. Please, please let this merchant know how user unfriendly they are toward folks with APO addresses."
1,Beware of gum damage using this model!,"I was a loyal user for years of the original Sonicare before it was sold to Phillips who designed this model. It worked wonders as I had no cavities for 5 years and no gum problem. Since ""upgrading"" to the 7500 I have gotten 1 cavity (on a receding gum area) and a detached gum using the ""new model 7500. I attribute this to a smaller brush head which is a poor design that ""overvibrates"" on a smaller area loosening up the gums causing them to recede. The original Sonlcare cleaned over a wider area with a flat brush to evenly spread out the vibrations. I wonder if the original inventor had a hand in this ""improved"" model? If it ain't broken don't fix it! If you are a dentist or gum specialist,please take notice!!"
2,"Nice product, but the battery life and replacement? Fooey!!!","Capitalism at its finest moment: Battery dies after the two year warranty, can't replace it, carefully dispose of it. Spend another 120 for a new one.Yeesh. At least sell replacement, proprietary batteries for the consumer to fix it!!"
4,Mold buildup in base.,"Great toothbrush, but water can collect under the brush head and ugly stuff will grow if you don't regularly take off the brush head to air it out. A bit of a hassle. I've had the brush over a year and my wife has an Oral-B. I'm thinking about getting an Oral-B for myself when it's time to get new brush heads (yes I've changed them over the time I've had the brush)."
5,Best toothbrush ever,"Sonicare is absolutely, utterly brilliant. I&#146;ve been using the Advance model for almost three years, and even though it's still working very well I'm seriously tempted to buy the Elite. It almost seems like it can't get any better, but if it does - I want it!Yes, it does cost a lot, but there is absolutely nothing that takes care of your teeth and gums like this thing does. As far as I&#146;m concerned, that&#146;s &#145;priceless&#146;. I used to have bad gum pocket problems, and now they are almost normal in depth. And every time you brush your teeth they get so squeaky clean it&#146;s like you&#146;ve just had a professional cleaning at the dentists. It takes some getting used to at first, but once you have you&#146;ll probably never be satisfied with another toothbrush again."
5,brushing your teeth is no longer a boring task!!,"wow!! i bought one of the 7500 elite series for my wife and after hearing her talk about how good it was, i decided to buy an extra twin pack of brush heads so i could see what the big deal was. if you have noticed in several of the other reviews, it states how you get that just left the dentists office feel. thats an understatement!! your teeth feel so amazingly clean, its kind of scary how good it works. a few people whine about the price but dont let that scare you away. i will have one for the rest of my life. its simple to use and the battery life off of one recharge lasts a good week or so. worth every penny."
5,No doubt worth the money!,"I am one of those unusual people who have a film that forms over my teeth after only a few hours, the positive part is that the film itself helps reduce the potential for tartar but I hate the way it makes my mouth feel. When I first got this toothbrush it was a bit much for me. I had not used an electric toothbrush before, but my husband's dentist and my dentist both recommended it. The first day using it I noticed that the film that usually formed on my teeth wasn't as heavy. The more I used the toothbrush the less film formed and the longer it took to form. Also, after using the toothbrush for a couple weeks the sensitivity wore off. My check-ups were always good, and my cleanings were never difficult, but I never imagined that it could be as easy as it is now!"
5,Almost perfect,"Once you start using this product, you can't go back to regular brushing. Only flaw this product has is the necessity of frequent removal of the toothbrush head from the main unit to enable the water that collect inside to drain out. If you forget to do this, the toothbrush starts to smell foul."
5,Sonic Elite 7500 toothbrush,"I purchased the Sonic Elite 7500 after my old (10 years) Sonicare finally passed away. My dentist recommended the sonicare system. I like the smaller brush and the timing device, which allows for 30 seconds of brushing on each quantrant. The Sonic Elite also comes with a travel case which makes it easy to pack without damage."
5,Best toothbrush! Better than my Oral B,I had the best Oral B and now this toothbrush recommended by my dentist. WOW! This toothbrush really is the best. My roommate AND girlfriend bought one after seeing mine and my teeth.I also love the timer with the little 30 second quadrants thing. That helps me out so much. Make sure to get the one with the timer.I just never could get the timing to change to 2.5 instead of 2. Never worked. I put it on the charger and held the button forever and nothing happened. Still... this is a small issue.
5,Much better,This toothbush is so much better than the old model. It fits in the mouth so much better and gets to places easily that would of been difficult to get to with the older model. Great toothbrush I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It's worth every penny.
3,Great but keeping it clean is a problem,"I love my new Sonicare. My teeth and gums have never been cleaner. My husband and I have noticed a big difference in the condition of our teeth since we purchased it.My problem is with cleaning it after use. I've tried using q tips, cotton, etc. because it says that you shouldn't run it under water. If you don't clean it out it gets quite fowl. I wish there was an easier way to keep it clean. It takes too much time in the morning to try to get into the crevises of the brush to clean it.I recommend this because it has really helped to improve the condition of my teeth and gums. But maintainence and battery charging problems (I've read this from other reviewers) may make me look for another brand once the battery is dead. For the money I spent, I shouldn't have any worries."
3,good but not great,"Recommended by my dentist, whom I trust. Product worked great; I loved the timer feature as I tended, like most people, to brush too quickly. My check-ups were improved, and my gums healthier as a result of using this product. However, after 2 years, the battery died. It is not replaceable and as far as I can tell, the unit must be disposed of--entirely. What an incredible waste. 5 stars otherwise. I will not replace it because it looks like the new version has the same 20th century engineering mindset. I thought Philips was a progressive product designer. Please correct me if I am wrong."
2,Annoying maintenance etc.,"Owned an Oral-B for 10+ happy years. Attractive pricing on Sonicare caused me to defect. Totally regretful. It thoroughly puzzles me that a design of a medical appliance causes a colossal harbor for bacteria/mold. Consumer needs to take the thing apart each week and resort to Q-tips etc. to at least ensure visual cleanliness. Fact is, growth of the nasties commences immediately whether it's visible or not and compounds with the number of uses in a given period. This same weird design accomplishes an ongoing revenue stream for the manufacturer because the screw-on brush head unique to this product is very expensive to replace comparatively...especially on the recommended schedule of every three months. That said, the cleaning action is quite good. But then, so was Oral-B's. And the closed design and cheap brush heads far exceeded their Sonicare counterparts."
2,Throw away,"Yeah, it works great until . . . the on/off button cover needs to be replaced. Sonicare says they cannot repair it. Also, from what I've been reading, you'll need to throw it out when the battery will not take a charge. Greed engineering!"
3,Frequent incompatible design changes,"I've never been able to replace a brush because there's always a newer model which uses a slightly different brush, and the old brushes aren't available. It's actually a rip-off. It's too bad because otherwise it's a good product. The same problem exists for all the parts. I've had to buy a whole new appliance (charger, handle, and brushes) twice because I lost the handle,twice because I needed a charger, and several times because the brushes wore out. I did it because there wasn't any real competition. But now I'm going to switch to a less expensive brand and stop paying $100 everytime I need to replace a part."
3,Good and Bad,"Cleans your teeth. Check. Now that that's settled. Let's look at the downside.It's expensive. Replacement heads are expensive. Ours died after a year and luckily was replaced d/t warranty. Then, after a year, the replacement died. Users of the Sonicare know what I'm talking about. We recently switched to Oral B. Hubby thinks the Oral B cleans better. I think they're about the same. However, the Oral B is cheaper and the heads are cheaper. Also, the Sonicare design creates a gunk environment where the head has to be taken apart to clean. So if you don't mind the expensive heads and you don't mind cleaning them once in a while and you like a quiet toothbrush, Sonicare is your toothbrush. Otherwise, my choice is the Oral B."
5,Amazing toothbrush,"All the positive reviews here are true, it feels like I've had a professional cleaning after I brush with it. I can think of nothing negative about it. I'd recommend it to anyone."
2,Non-replaceable battery unacceptable,"This is a wonderful toothbrush, but I find it absurd that the battery life is 3-5 years (2 1/2 in our case), and the batteries are non-replaceable."
5,Great Product,"My dentist suggested Sonicaire, but I thought, ""Yea, sure, this pricey toothbrush is going to make a difference?"" But, after using the Sonicaire for two months, the gum pain and sensitivity I've lived with for years has decreased to almost nil. I'm delighted! Now I have to eat humble pie during my next visit to the dentist."
4,instruction manual is misleading,"I just got the Elite 7500 and it sure does seem to do a nice job of brushing my teeth. It feels kind of funny when it is brushing, but the manual says you ge tused to that. The manual also says that it beeps when you turn it on, and after every 30 seconds of use. It *does not* beep at all. I called Phillips and they told me the manual is wrong and there is no beeper built into it. The Quadrapacer feature just makes the toothbrush stop for a second or two - it does not beep as the manual says. It is not a big deal, but the first time I used it, I kept it in one part of my mouth waiting for the beep, which never came. Just something to be aware of."
5,Worth every penny,"It seemed like a little too much money to be paying for a toothbrush, but after using it only once, I knew it was worth it. My teeth and gums immediately felt cleaner, more smooth, and after a couple of weeks, I noticed a definate change in the color of my teeth. It sure wasn't a hardcore dental bleaching white, but it was noticeable enough to impress me. This product is very recommended, and Phillips provides a great warranty in the case of an accident."
5,Great Dental Care Tool,"The Sonicare Elite 7500 electric toothbrush is rated highly in reviews because it's comfortable to use, and is effective at removing plaque. Its ultrasonic bristle movement reaches hard-to-clean areas, like along the gum line and between teeth. The Sonicare toothbrush has a non-slip handle, two speeds, and is rechargeable. It beeps every thirty seconds to prompt you to clean a different area, and shuts off automatically after two minutes. Oral-health experts say we should brush twice a day for two minutes, and there's evidence that people brush longer with the Sonicare electric toothbrush than with a manual brush.I use it everyday, and I notice a significant lessening of plague buildup around my teeth. Highly recommended for anyone who values oral care."
2,"Lot's of vibration, strong EMF","I have purchased my Sonicare over the holidays and me and my spouse have used it for couple of weeks. I found it to be very unpleasant - way too much vibration for my liking. It seems that electromagnetic field in the toothbrush is quite strong as well - after regular for couple of weeks, we have found that it could cause you to become more easily irritated. This might not be true for everyone but was true for us. We have returned our Sonicare toothbrush, and did switch to manual for now - but likelly switch back to Oral-B - we used to have one in the past."
4,Backlash 2007 Review,Backlash 2007 was a great ppv.The Hardyz vs Cade and Murdoch Tag Team TitlesA pretty good match. 7.5/10Melina vs Mickie James Womens Title MatchThis is one of the best womens title matches ive ever seen. 7/10Chris Benoit vs MVP US Title MatchGood match not much to say about this. 7/10Heres where this ppv gets very good.Lashley vs The McMahons and Umaga Ecw Title MatchI liked this match a lot i think this is under-rated. 7.5/10Undertaker vs Batista Last Man Standing World Heavyweight ChampionshipWOW! Amazing Match! 9/10Cena vs Orton vs Edge vs HBK Four Way Fatal WWE ChampionshipGreat match not as good as the last match but still a great match. 8.5/10Overall Backlash is a great ppv with no bad matches but some of the matches could be better.
2,Last Years Was Better!!!,"This PPV sucked, I was at last years in Lexington KY, first ever PPV I've been to and it was better then this years. I would never buy this dvd, unless it was like $4 at Wal-Mart like the big sell they had last fall."
3,Good but Ends Up Same,"WWE Backlash 2007 was good but ended up damm same and stupid.1. Hardy def. Cade 'n' Murdoch. it was a decent match.2. Melina def Mickie James. it was just an ordinary divas match.3. Benoit def MVP. it was an boring match completely.4. Mcmahon,Umaga def Lasley. like last year mcmahon got 1 more backlash victory.5. Undertaker def Batista. the match ended up a draw but was the best match of the evening.6. Cena Def HBK.EDGE 'N' ORTON. cena won by landing on a fallen randy orton after getting a sweat chin music by hbk. the end was stupid hbk could win the match if he was a bit faster.WWE BACKLASH IS MUST ORDER FOR TAKER 'N' CENA FANS."
3,pretend you're hearing the concert out in the parking lot,"This release is truly only for fans of Soft Machine who have their other available concert material already. The sound quality rates only one star, although the performance itself would rate five stars. The person who recorded this concert (Brian Hopper) claims that you'll hear the concert as it was for a member of the audience. Given that Brian's brother Hugh has said that the goal of each band member during this time was to play louder than the others, the muddy distorted sound may indeed be close to what the audience actually heard. Again, the performance is great, but start with Backwards, Noisette, or Virtually if you haven't heard those yet."
2,For completists only,"You can't fault the performance on this album and this is considered by many to be one of the best Soft Machine line-ups.Unfortunately, this concert was recorded by Hugh Hopper's brother with a portable tape-recorder and the sound quality on this release is atrocious. The drums are inaudible, there's noisy hiss all over the recording and to top it off, there are speed problems with the recording resulting in a jangly sound in a lot of places. This is definitely a 'completists only'-release."
3,Softs Crazies Only,Yes... the sound is very dated... what do you get with a hand-held tape recorder in 1970... tapes speed fluxs and all the worts... well... that being said you can guess quality of sonics but not the performance. The performance is fantastic and it takes my bootleg weary ears to tell. Buy at your own risk but how can I say don't... it's Soft Machine!
2,Don't begin here...,"Lou Reed rocks!!! Dude!! But methinks this collection dost not. The tunes are all good, but there aren't very many of them, and the sound is deplorable, in that inimitable RCA-first-CD-edition sort of way (fans of the Jefferson Airplane and Harry Nilsson know what I'm talking about). A much better jumping off point would be ""Different Times: Lou Reed in the 70's"", or, even better, check out ""Transformer"" or ""Rock 'n' Roll Animal""."
1,Once upon a time there was a movie...,"...called ""Walk On the Wild Side"", whose powerful Ellingtonesque theme spawned first an impassioned vocal version by R & B legend Brook Benton (""One day of prayin' and six nights of fun...The odds against goin' to Heaven are six to one""), then a version by Jimmy Smith which fused the big band blast of the movie version with his own nimble organ work. Many many years passed, and then a man who could not really sing did a whole new song that went by that title (Lou Reed once wryly commented that his own work could be considered rap--after all, it was of roughly the same tonal range). Nowadays when you mention ""Walk On the Wild Side"", the response ain't got squat to do with the day of prayin' and the six nights of fun--nope, it's more like ""and the colored girls go doop-de-doop."" I did a Morpheus search this morning and was lucky to nail the Smith version--I drew a blank on the Benton version. But I turned up more than a dozen Reed versions. Grrr!!"
5,Solved our problems,"After burning thru about 6 different feeders, this one did it all. Simple, easy to clean, excellent tough material and construction, and the best part--to the detriment of too many pigeons-- the dome is easily adjustable (up/down) protect the seeds and adjust to the type of bird you want to attract. Absolutely 5+ stars."
2,"Did not work, the squirrel was able to jump into the food tray","I think I had high expectations for the product, but did not work, it was able to stop the squirrel a week, until she realizes how to get into the food tray. Another one that does not work, very expensive though. Seller sent it prompt and quick very well packed, but again, the squirrel beat it."
3,A disappointing read,"I purchased this book with the thought that I'd read up on Suwannee River history before undertaking a weeklong paddling trip on the Suwannee. The book is not what I expected. What I expected was a physical and sociological history of the river. The Native American inhabitants of the area as well as early European explorers of the region are given short shrift. Instead, the book focuses on a family of white settlers who live in the Okefenokee Swamp. The book reads almost like a novel.At the end of the book, an essay titled ""Rivers and American Folk"" by Constance Lindsay Skinner explains the scope of the Rivers of America series: ""This is to be a literary and not an historical series. The authors of these books will be novelists and poets."" I wish I had known this before investing my time and money in this book."
4,Country Fried fun,"The Reverend is in fine form on this, mostly, recorded live disk. there is great honky tonk paino playing and riotiously funny songs. The stories between songs are great too. But the most important distinction between The Rev Billy C. Wirtz and the rest of the yahoos with an inturment, is that The Rev. can strike a chord that moves you. Check out Grandma v. The Crusher. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be hopelessly addicted."
4,Quiet-Close toilet seat,Kohler K-4636-47. Seat works as expected. Directions on how to remove it for easy cleaning were either missing or totally unclear.
4,Luxury seat lid,We have had this product for a few months now and we are very happy with this purchase. Lid closes effortlessly and has never failed to close.
1,Don't buy this! Junk!,"The hardware is SO cheap on this seat, it never stays in place and it makes a nice seat the worst thing ever. The ""quick"" release works well when you sit on it and the seat slides off the toilet. The bolts are plastic and will not allow the seat to be securely be screwed down. Very disappointed in Kohler with this product. Returned it to Amazon the next day."
1,Poor quality,Arrived with a broken hinge. We chose to not replace as the quality of the entire product was thin and flimsy.
1,so bad I kept the old mayfair,"Just installed a new kohler commode that came with this seat. The hinge system was so loose that it slid sideways on the commode with the least pressure. Although the Mayfair seat on the commode I was replacing was looking a little old, I put it on the new commode rather than keep the Kohler one. The Kohler seat has a sealed hinge system, and there is no way to improve the action so that the seat doesn't slide sideways. A very poor design."
1,Junk Cheap Design,If I could give it negative stars I would. The clips are cheap plastic and do not hold it in place. it moves.
2,"Quiet, smooth - - UNCOMFORTABLE","Works good. Quiet, smooth....but it is the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SEAT I have ever sat on.Came with my new toilet, but I'll be changing it to something else...verrry quickly. I keep thinking it is 'just me' but after reading other reviews it seems I'm not the only one in ""uncomfortable"" territory."
1,Kohler toilet seat,"I was very disappointed with the seat. It wasn't any better quality than the one that came with the toilet. If you spend that much for a toilet, you don't want to sit on a flimsy, cheap plastic seat."
3,A Pricey Piece Of Plastic That Works Well,"The seat works well, is comfortable enough for the intended use, but....2 star dock for the high price. It's a pieces of molded plastic, including the bolts that connect it to the commode. Glad I don't need anymore, but had to match the toilet and couldn't find any better choices."
5,Best Toliet seat money can buy...,"Yes it costs a little more, but the quality is first rate and worth the extra cost. No more accidentally slammed lids in the middle of the night. Easy to clean, Looks sharp. I have purchased one for each bathroom and never will be sorry."
3,"Nice seat, but not perfect","This seat is made of high quality material. The quiet close mechanism is a nice touch. The quick release also seems like a nice feature on paper, however in reality, it causes a less than perfect connection to the toilet. When you start tightening the screws, it starts opening up the jaw of the quick release mechanism and starts releasing the seat. In order to keep the jaw intact, you need to not tighten it that much in which case the seat becomes a bit wiggly and not completely tight in its spot. It seems like a good idea but it is not implemented well in reality. I would have given it a 5 star rating if they skipped that feature all together."
3,Might be nice,it might be a good product however BOTH times the item came with a broken piece. I sent the first one back same day received the new one 3 days later but it was broken at the same place also. I have returned both and just ordered one from another online store. But my refund has been credited fine.
3,toilet seat,"Product seemed well made. It did not come with instructions and therefore did not fit as a replacement easily. It would be better if the product came with information as to which Kohler toilets is would fit or, reverse, one was able to find which replacement seat one could use for a specific toilet. Very distressing to see a company like Kohler which we all respect to leave you stranded like this ezpecially when the seat that originally came with the toilet had an extremely weak, tho' crucial, plastic part which gave out within 3 years of intemittent use in a powder room."
4,Its a toilet seat!,"I bought this from Amazon as it was much cheaper than my local store. I bought the toilet bowl from the store as I read too many reviews about broken toilets and didn't want to risk that happening when I was employing a plumber to fit it, but I was happy to take the risk on the seat. The seat was packaged well and there was no problems. I have had a soft close lid before and I really like them. The only issue, if any, with this seat is its not the strongest, meaning you can sit on it when its closed, but you will notice it sinks in a bit. Obviously this isn't the main purpose of a toilet seat so its no big deal unless you need to regularly sit on the toilet with the lid closed. If that is the case I would probably go for something much more solid, but I doubt you will be able to get such a product in the soft close."
5,Closes very slowly and quietly,The toilet seat and the lid close extremely slowly and quietly. The cover and seat are made out of a lighter weight plastic than I was expecting. The seat and lid does NOT feel like a cheap seat. It is just made from a lighter weight plastic.There are no bangs or squeaks or any sounds coming from cover/lid or the seat when it is opened or closed.
2,mine ware broken,"we ordered 2 for our house,what a surprise was when we opened them,on bothof them the plastic cover of the holder was brokenvery dissapointed"
1,Don't waste your money on Kohler!,"Don't waste your money on Kohler! I bought a new ""HIGHLINE COMPLETE"". 2 days after installing it, it backed up after my 10 year old daughter used it! It was rated the 5 STAR flush, their most powerful! What a joke! It couldn't even handle a 10 year old girl's poops! DO NOT WASTE you $$ on this product! And of course, LOWES policy is you can not return a toilet once its been used! HOW ELSE are you gonna find out it doesn't do what they promised!??! So buy the cheaper model. I'll never buy another Kohler product ever!"
1,Total junk,"I bought one of these at the suggestion of the salesman when I purchased my toilet; it was part of a total bathroom renovation. The lid comes off of the seat assembly constantly; to fix it, I have to take the entire seat & lid off the toilet, turn it upside down and push the things that make it close slowly back into the holes and put the thing back on the toilet. I have done this three to four times per week since our bathroom was completed about 15 months age. I HATE THIS THING. When I finally went to Lowes this week to replace it, it was the only Kohler seat they had for my model toilet."
1,terrible!,i installed this seat three times trying to get it to stay on the bowl. it would snap off every time i lifted both parts of the seat. the bottom section of the seat would come apart. and it stayed wiggley and would not tighten snuggley. terrible product at a terrible price. i spent $20 more on this seat trusting the name. i am so disapointed.
2,Wouldn't buy again,"Looks nice but installation was a pain. Plus the hinge for the seat and cover was partly disassembled and I had to uninstall the whole thing and figure it out. It wasn't hard but why should I have to do it at all? And not a word about it in the pathetic excuse for installation instructions. One of the ""nuts"" wouldn't tighten b/c it was stripped, I may have to try to get another one. I don't like the flimsy ""quick release"" hinges and I'm not eager to try the feature. The hinge covers don't quite reach the seat so it looks crappy. As noted elsewhere, the seat is funnel shaped, not flat, so not comfortable. Doesn't Kohler sit on their own toilet seats before releasing them to production? I won't return it (unless it breaks) but I wouldn't buy this model again."
2,Epic FAIL of product design,"The combination of the Quick-Release system and the slow-close mechanism simply does not work. The slow-close mechanism puts a lot of stress on the mounting brackets, which wiggle around due to the utterly POINTLESS quick-release system. Solved the issue by permanently attaching the ridiculous quick-release parts to the mounting brackets with epoxy resin, but a well-designed product should not need such measures!"
2,very uncomfortable,"The quiet close feature does not make up for the following : by far the most uncomfortable toilet seat my derriere has ever sat on. It is not flat, the sides angle inward and the seat seems to tilt to the back which makes us short people sit even higher from the floor. Unfortunatly, I bought two of them and we may have to replace if we can't get used to them."
2,Boring and outdated,Lost interest in this book about 1/4 way through. Will donate it. Outdated information. There are some good ideas in the book.
3,Pleasant Listening,"I tracked this album down and bought it because the Skeletons backed Syd Straw on War and Peace, playing with an energy there which added much to her songs. I don't find that energy here. The songs roll past, well-played, well-written and pleasant enough, but nothing grabbed me by the throat and wouldn't let go, especially after four or five listenings over a couple of week. It's a democratic band for sure. Three write or co-write, and all four take turns singing lead. Keyboardist Joe Terry has two of the three best songs, Mad Old Lady and Whiffle Ball; the other is Pay to Play. If they really needed to record Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, why not I Wonder What She's Doing Tonight instead of the eminently forgettable Teardrop City? Heard in a bar, with a couple micro brews under your belt, these guys would probably sound like the best band in the world. (And I gather that's why SS got them for War and Peace.) It just doesn't translate to CD."
