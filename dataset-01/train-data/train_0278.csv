3,Uncut unrated?,Not a bad movie. I wish I would have had been able to find a rated and cut version though.
3,Factory Girl Review,"Director George Hickenlooper's biographical drama charts the meteoric rise and subsequent fall from grace of Edie Sedgwick (Sienna Miller), an ambitious starlet who becomes the muse of Andy Warhol (Guy Pearce). Heading for New York City's bright lights after dropping out of college in 1965, Edie meets pop-culture icon Andy, who turns her into the toast of the town. But she soon discovers that glamour and fame have a price."
2,Edie Deserves Better,"First off, Sienna Miller gives it a college try but she's too old for the part. For most of the arc of the story in this film, Edie's supposed to be 19-25. No way is Sienna believable as an ingenue at this point. She's got her accent down but lacks the luminosity and charm of the singular Mz. Sedgwick. Instead, she comes off as annoying.Granted, to recreate Edie and the era in which she reigned would be an extremely tall order for any film maker. Unfortunately, their efforts fall far short here.Siouxie, Brooklyn"
3,"Grrrr, no french subtitles >:-[","Il n'y a pas de sous-titres en franais contrairement à ce qui est indiqué sur la page Amazon, juste des sous-titres en anglais pour malentendants (c'est à dire avec indication des bruits)."
1,"Like Edie's story, without the burden of facts and complexity","Short and sweet, because others have said it perfectly already, this film's grasp on Edie's story is as shallow and misguided as the average first grade student's understanding of the American Civil War. If you are hungry for Edie, turn to Jean Stein'sEdie: American Girlor David Weisman'sEdie: Girl on Fire- both great books.Taken as simple entertainment, this film is bland. Taken as a biographical film, it's downright offensive in its utter disregard for fact - made all the more baffling when you consider that the TRUE STORY IS SO MUCH MORE COMPELLING AND DRAMATIC!"
3,Kind of meanders,"The real Edie and the real Andy Warhol, I would imagine, were much more interesting than this film makes them out to be. I haven't read the history and I doubt this little bio-pic is very accurate. Did she really have a short love affair with Bob Dylan? I would like to know. It's not mentioned in the extras. The film seems to build itself on a jealousy between Dylan and Warhol over Edie's affections. True or not? This is one case where truth was probably stranger than fiction."
4,"Boring Movie, Phenominal Acting!","The movie was very very boring. I've been a big fan of the Warhol/Factory scene, but this movie just didn't have much going for it--aside from the acting.Pearce's portrayal of Warhol was 100% accurate, from the look, the voice, the posture, and body language. There's a few complaints about the Bob Dylan character, but I thought it was right on, Bob Dylan is an oakie folk singer not that complex a role--Christensen's acting was great. Miller was breath-taking, the camera adores her, and just the look in her eyes--you could really feel the emotion pouring out of her."
1,Poor Amazon DVD package,"I got this DVD...However, your package is AWFUL when shipping. The disc was jumped off the fixed button of the case. Its surface is full of scratched.................Your package shall be wrapped more bubble paper to prevent from shaking and outer pressure."
1,Awful-,Awful - awful piece about nutcase (and I mean nutcase) rich girl hanging out with the king of whack - jobs- Andy Warhol. It has NO plot. Just meanders along haphazardly from one vulgar scene to another. P.U. 20 minutes and it went back in the Netflix envelope and returned. Yaawwwnnn.
1,weak story,"The movie dragged and although it was based on real people, the story was hardly captivating. The main character was also hard to relate to: A spoiled rich girl who gets involved with drugs and the wrong crowd and ultimately is ruined by her own weaknesses, wah..wah..wah. Who cares? It was a total waste of money."
1,"in all fairness,unfair to Edie Sedgwick","This film is a poor portrait of the genuine article.It seems very fake . Sienna Miller is lacking the sparkling and perfectly symmetrical beauty of Edie Sedgwick, bearing no resemblance except the make-up and hairdo, mimicking Edie Sedgwick very unflatteringly.I'm waiting fro Warhol's ""Kitchen"" and ""beauty"" starring the real Edie Sedgwick.I highly discourage the purchase of this bland film, lacking in all respects."
2,"Poorly Acted, Poorly Executed Film","Factory Girl is a poorly executed, poorly acted film about poor little rich girl Edie Sedgwick. The socialite/drug addict who starred in Warhol films and made a celebrity splash is portrayed by Sienna Miller, who simply does not do justice to the tragic socialite. Factory Girl is a biographical film and as such is obligated to adhere to some semblance of ""what was"" or ""how it happened"". In this film, it does neither.Edie Sedgwick's rise to celebrity was due to her charism and waiflike charm that drew people to her. Miller acted as if she used Liza Minelli as her role model! The film viewer is left confused as to why anyone would want Edie Sedgwick in their life--she is portrayed as shallow, boring,and without an ounce of sexuality, despite the R rating for nudity.Overall, the film doesn't add up. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Don't waste your time...,"Sienna Miller's portrayal of 60's icon Edie Sedgwick is an embarrassment. She portrays Edie as an empty-headed twit and her affected accent is ridiculous and cloying. While Edie Sedgwick without a doubt had deep emotional problems, she was also incredibly intelligent, well-educated and articulate. To portray her as a naive dip who does nothing but search for love is over-simplication at it's worst. The real Edie was much more complex than that. The film is highly-fictionalized as well, which only adds to it's annoyance factor. Reveiwers who praise the film and/or Miller's performance have no concept of Sedgwick, Warhol or The Factory. This film is a complete and utter waste of time. Additionally, the ""real"" Edie documentary (also included on this DVD) is nothing but an extended version of the end credits of the film."
5,"Excellent, excellent, good friend!","The product is exactly what I expected. It includes an English translation of the Dhammapada in the front section followed by an analytic presentation of the text in Pali with the English translation presented a second time followed by a vocabulary analysis that goes into enough depth to help the student recognize how insufficient translations can become. It's a marvelous ""trot"" to help study the Dhammapada without getting caught in the misleading thicket that arises in every translation. This book is a major help in avoiding that pitfall: Traduttore, tradditore!"
4,Nice rainbows but somewhat smaller than expected,We hung this on a sunny window and it creates small rainbows. The size of the crystal is somewhat smaller than expected.
5,Great Story!,What an amazing story. The story line was charged with cultural differences and taboos that you would not expect from a lesbian love story. I was not expecting this movie to be as good as it was. It has become my new favorite ;-)
3,Very PG film,"Decent film for the value. Nice to have 2 of Sarif's films in one place. I didn't relate enough to the characters to be drawn into the relationships, so for me, a little disappointing."
5,Amazing Box Set :),"I was so happy when my box set arrived. It contained my favorite movie of all time, I Can't Think Straight. The bonus was The World Unseen. I could watch these movies over and over, the message each delivers is one of hope, inspiration, love and self awareness in a sometimes unforgiving world. I highly recommend both movies for many reasons. The amazing acting, strong storyline, fantastic creator and director. It even came with a bonus CD soundtrack from the movie :). I am so thrilled I found these movies on Amazon!Thanks, enjoy everyone, this is one buy you do not want to pass up on!Mary-Ann"
3,Made me wish I was that age again...,Production and acting very good. Cute romance between 2 YOUNG ladies. A bedroom scene that was PG-13. Made me want to be young and experiencing first times again...
2,"""I Can't Think Straight""","The disk I received (I Can't Think Straight)skips in a great many areas. It's as though it has already been used and I ordered mine ""new"".Whereas ""The World Unseen"" is fine. I'm very disappointed and know it can't be returned. Am considering buying directly from store so anything like that can be returned.Gloria Hansen"
5,ICTS + World unseen,"You can miss this.. it contains some great features and behind the scenes... great quality of both movies..And both movies have bubtitles in Spanish, portuguese, japanese and chinese if you are worry about it."
1,the world unseen + i cant think straight,"i bought the box set and ""i cant think straight"" has a major glitch in it, as if it were scratched it wont play i can only see the first 10 mins...uuummm soo i dont know what to do, the world unseen is playing just fine so how can i get 'i cant think straight"" replaced or do i have to send the whole box set back, does anyone know if there is a number to call??"
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"Like a previous reviewer, I can appreciate the author's efforts. Being a physicist, I am well aware of how difficult it is to explain even the simplest concepts of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, I find the book to be extremely boring if you happen already to know something of QM, and extremely confusing if you are trying to learn something about it. I'd highly recommend George Gamow's Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland, instead, which I read for the first time in my junior year in college 17 years ago, and several times more since then, always with great joy."
3,Fun Book to read,"Very fun book almost complimentary to Mr. Tompkins. A lotof concepts are explained, Uncertainity with Heisenberg Bank, matter antimatter, electric current,I loved the description of electrontron spin described as umbrellas up or down,two slit experient, superposition principal with taking routes in the wilderness. It is very nice to put some imaginations into Quantum Concepts. I think it is very good book for interested student in high school, before he gets into dry formulas of Quantum Mechanics to see what is to come or someone who is already in it to put some image to the formulas."
2,Whimsical but confusing,"I bought Alice in Quantumland for my bright soon-to-be 12-year-old daughter. She's very interested in quantum physics, but I'm afraid this book will be daunting for her.The writing style is generally good -- smart but accessible and witty. My main complaint is that all of the complicated points are explained purely through words, in fact, through long blocks of text.Even most adult-oriented books on quantum physics that I've seen in the past come with plenty of diagrams to explain concepts like interference, uncertainty, etc. This book features some amusing (and well-drawn) illustrations of the characters, but the absence of explanatory diagrams is a major weakness.The concepts explained here are paradoxical and difficult. The narrative helps make them a little easier to understand, but the lack of visual aids keeps this book from being truly great.Suggestion to the author and publisher: Add some simple diagrams of quantum phenomena in the next edition!"
1,No no no!,"I don't really even want to take the time to bother saying why; it wasn't worth it! I wholly appreciate what Robert Gilmore is trying to do (make quantum physics more palatable for novice readers), but his analogies aren't clear and he puts too much effort into trying to be the Reverend Mister Dodgson. For a much less insipid book, try Fred Alan Wolf's ""Taking the Quantum Leap""; or for a more comprehensive history of things, look into George Gamow's ""The Great Physicists from Galileo to Einstein"" (originally published under a different title, but I see it's here at amazon.com). Gamow's book is dated (early '60s), but surprisingly relevant and well-written. It's amazing NOT to see constant references to Feynman!"
4,A brief and whimsical tour of quantum physics,"I read this book as a junior in high school and loved it. It's a wonderful introduction to quantum physics for those whose interests are pique but just simply don't know much about the topic. It isn't meant for those who already know the basic nor those who analyze every word of a text; it is meant to be a very basic beginner's book. As that, I think it works very well. It's witty while trying to explain difficult topics. It doesn't talk down to you. Overall, a good book."
3,"Interesting book, worth the read for non-mathmatics types","It was an interesting way to present quantum mechanics of subatomic particles, but I was left wondering what has happened in the last twenty years that is missing from the book."
4,A Fun and Brief Journey Through some Theories in QP,"I thought it was a creative book that captured how one felt when they first started learning about quantum physicist . The examples in it help take away some of the confusion , but some of it you have to accept without understanding . It makes a good children's book , if you want to put them to sleep . All and all it's a fun book ."
1,Error,"I ordered the coated but received the metal one. Unfortunately, I did not realize it until it was too late for a return. The box was labeled coated, but the item inside was the burnished metal."
2,Works BUT,I normally love KitchenAid products. My problem with this is I have now bought 3 of these because the coating wears down and I end up eating the stuff and than notice I have to replace the item. The bottom shows bare metal. Not sure what the coating is made of but I doubt it was made for me to be eating. My poor cake had hard little pieces of the coating in it. I have lined the beater up again but not sure how often you need to do this. Hate to having to worry about this.
2,Not great quality...,I was disappointed in this product. It is not the best quality that I was expect from Kitchenaid. It now sits with the rest of the gadgets I wish I had never bought.
4,American History Through Sports,"I understand that when Michael Hurd was putting together this book and calling historically black colleges to talk to them about their long-gone football programs, some college employees responded with, ""We used to have a football program?"" This is not a book of just names, dates and places -- it describes a unique time and the very unique culture that surrounded football at historically black colleges, and programs that, at the time, were storied and exhaulted. This peek into the past should prove interesting to anyone interested in the cultural aspects of American history, not just people who like American football (which I don't, by the way). For what it is -- a very targeted history book about a very particular period and practice -- I give it four stars. Obviously a labor of love by the author."
2,Statistical analysis of cases,"This book uses quantitative approach, purely statistical. Except chapter 7 giving possible application to case study research, as written by Yin, the rest proves how statistics may help selecting and analyzing a small numbers of cases. The tille misled me. Case study should be extended limit of stastistical analysis to wide reality, especially in postmodern worldwide. If so, this book does not suit you."
3,For Crimson Collectors,"For the casual listener, the music here isn't all that stellar. Sinfield is a better behind the scenes man, writing lyrics, producing etc. than he is a singer/guitarist.As a Crim related solo outing I think most hardcore fans of the early group would want to own this just for the sake of the collection of musicians here(Greg Lake, Mel Collins,John Wetton, Ian Wallace, Boz Burrell, Keith Tippet).Lake's vocal performances on the duets ""Wholefood Boogie"" and the title cut totally upstage Sinfield's weak vocals.On some material his voice is appropriate; like on ""Song Of The Sea Goat"", and ""The Piper""(great flute from Collins)which have a dramatic classical feel not unlike some of Crimson's work on Lizard and Islands. Excursions into country ,""Will It Be You"" and rock n' roll, ""Wholefood Boogie"" are ill advised.A lesser Crimson fan would probably rate this a lot lower overall."
4,"Still, it's Not Bad","After reading the other reviews, and listening to this album for the first time, I can't add much to the other reviews, except to say that Sinfield is not that bad a singer. I think his voice lends itself more to folk music or even folk rock. I will say the vocals are better than those of Crimson's third lp, Lizard.I was prepared for a vocal performance worse than Lizard and was surprised to find that Sinfield's vocals are actually better! He does best on quiet songs with a soft, dreamy feel. I remember seeing this album when it first came out in the early 70's and was going to buy for the cover art. Although that was the reason I brought the first Crimson album without having any idea of what they sounded like, I will still say that this is not a bad album -- not as good as Court of the Crimson King -- but equal to Lizard or even Islands. I brought the vinyl lp and not the cd."
3,not as compelling as previous works by Reed,"In Japanese By Spring, Reed loses much of the force of his earlier works, such as Mumbo Jumbo and The Free-lance Pallbearers. A professor named Chappie Puttbutt fails to receive tenure at the racist Jack London College. The school is then taken over by the Japanese, who put Puttbutt's Japanese teacher in charge. Puttbutt becomes his adviser, and begins to seek revenge for not making tenure. The story becomes somewhat amusing, but the satire is nowhere near as strong as in Reed's earlier work. Reed also inserts himself into the novel as a minor character, but then moralizes for many pages atthe end of the book, leaving it without a good conclusion. Reed is an excellent writer, but stay away from Japansese By Spring unless you intend to compare it to his other work."
3,Not my favorite,"I had to buy this book for a Linguistic Anthropology ""Language and Culture"" class I was taking and dreaded having to read this book. The way it's written is just so utterly boring. If you're looking for an interesting read related to the subfield, I would recommend the 2nd edition of ""Linguistic Anthropology"", edited by Alessandro Duranti."
2,Agar's ego interferes with his insight,"The actual content of this book and its truly interesting parts are muddled by its author's self-righteous, self-important conversational style of writing.The author frequently inserts snippets about himself (whom he has quite a high opinion of), unbearably awkward similes and off-the-cuff thoughts in an effort to be clever or interesting, and winds up being neither. Perhaps his excuse is that anthropological linguistics is a very personal study, one in which fieldwork cannot be done without factoring in the researcher's temperaments. In either case, this book quickly becomes tiresome due to the author's intrusive, egotistical ramblings.There are plenty of interesting points that he makes; unfortunately, you will have to wade through plenty of self-indulgent blather to discover them."
3,Looks Good,Only gripe is that the actual seat is shorter then I expected. Seem solid enough for breakfast bar.
2,Not for bicycles!,"Although this is an effective degreaser, it leaves a bad film on everything that it touches. I used it on my road bike and I had to spend a full afternoon scrubbing my bike, especially the braking surfaces. Leave it on your engine blocks, but nothing that needs to be shining when you are done."
2,Not for me,"Up until now I've only used alcohol based aftershaves, but I decided to try this for a change.What I like is that the smell is pleasant, really pleasant. It strikes a nice balance between being too weak and overpowering.What I don't like is the lack of any kind of sensation when I put it on. No burning, no cooling, no relief. It just feels like I'm rubbing on a scented lotion. It also leaves an oily residue on your skin.Really it's just preference. I can see how other people prefer this product, but not me."
1,This will leave your face oily,"I have used countless different facial moisturizers and aftershave balms. This is easily the worst. While it has a good scent, it does not fully absorb into your skin. It will leave an oily film on your skin making it look and feel greasy. Just terrible given the price point. If you are in the market for a good post-shave moisturizer, for high end product both Anthony for Men and Jack Black make great products. I even like Olay's Regenerist. If you only want to spend $5, use Every Man Jack's post-shave moisturizer. I cannot stress enough how bad this product is. It is a HUGE step down from the quality of the shaving cream. Nobody wants a greasy/oily face, especially when the product is $30-$40."
1,Reformulation is bad,"This product was reformulated sometime in the last six months. The scent now bears no resemblance to the old sandalwood scent. It smells like sweet baby powder. The consistency is noticeably thinner, and it is now a brown color. TAOS used to be one of the best, warmest sandalwood scents around, and now, this product should not even have the word sandalwood among its descriptors or ingredients."
4,"Very Nice, But, Maybe Not The Best","I've used a few premium balms such as this from AOS, Wm. Neumann & Co., and Truefitt & Hill. Out of the three, it's hands down Wm. Neumann & Co. followed by Truefitt & Hill and AOS a close third. But compared to many, all three are the best you can get, IMHO. I think the difference lies in the herbs and extracts in the Wm Neumann & Co Balms that make it the best for me.I have the AOS Balm in Lavender and Sandalwood. Both are very nice and I have them in my rotation despite my preference with the other two mentioned; The variety is nice.You can't go wrong with this from AOS. I like it, and you probably will too!"
3,Didn't work for my skin.,"I ordered the lavender balm along with the AOS lavender shaving cream (which i like) and was disappointed in the moisturizing capabilities of the balm.Although the smell is fantastic it didn't calm my sensitive skin at all. I have switched back to my old, cheaper standby (Gillette for sensitive skin).Edit- I now use this balm after first applying another product first to calm my skin. I then apply AOS lavender balmand have found that it works well as a sealing layer that has the added benefit of smelling terrific, so I feel fine now about having bought this product."
4,good but could have been better,"I was eagerly awaiting this release, but found the finished product did not live up to my personal hype. Don't get me wrong I am a huge fan of the disc but would have liked more solo equipto. ""yeah mane"" is my favorite track and just happens to be the only song featuring solo equipto. Equipto's flows are so sick i was looking forward to 3 verses per song, but most of the tracks feature only 1 quipto verse. Looking forward to more solo equipto in the future."
2,Obscure,"Poetry is an art form that succeeds only if the reader can share with the poet a vision communicated by the poem. How this work won a pulitzer prize escapes me. The only way for an ""outsider"" the read this book is with an interpreter and a dictionary so the obscure, at least from my point of view, references can be appreciated. As a reader I get no sense of the images the writer wants to conjure and the poems fail to take me anywhere but to the cliff of reason where I am just left without a bridge for crossing. I do not wonder I was able to purchase this book for such a low price."
4,"This is a definite hit CD , with catchy hooks and deep bass.","Sillkk the shocker is one of the more clever lyricists coming out of the no limit camp. his off beat flow mixed with his southern drawl make for ear catching lines like:guns we all got sometimes they all glocks..... and best believe that they all cocked. A definite honor roll sophomore album for the shocker. The appearances by P,Fiend,C-murder and of course mystical make this CD and all the other no limit soldiers CD's a definite 6-disc carnival."
1,What a disappointment...,this was the worst CD no limit put out...this is P's little brotha...and his sh*t is that weak..Betta luck next time
4,sECOND BEST SOLO ALBUM.,"IF YOU GET THIS ALBUM.....YOU GOTTA GET HIS FIRST ALBUM ""THE SHOKKER"" ITS LIKE WATCHING BLADE TRINITY WITH OUT SEEING THE FIRST TWO.... AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WOULD EVEN WASTE MY TIME BUYING THIS CD UNLESS I ALREADY HEARD AND OWNED THE FIRST ONE. YOU GOTTA HEAR NUMBER 14 ON THE FIRST ONE..."
4,good,i liked the album. im just glad hes not on every song by himself. he must be the absolutely worst rapper i have ever hurd. wack garbage everything in the book but i liked the album.
5,SILKK---- BEST LP,This is silkk the shockers best lpmade man is awfultry (My world My way ) - that is the 2nd best from SILKK
2,People Always Talkin Bout How Your A Busta,"I respect No Limit records to some extent. At one time I actually felt Master P and his music, along with some other No Limit artist. But Silk Da Busta Shocker??? This kat cant rhyme. Ever try to listen to his lyrics? Shaq and Will Smith have better lyrics than this fool. Silk Da Shocker has no business touching a microphone. I dont see why this album went platinum. Track one is nice I must admit, but Silk is only on that track for 20 sec out of the entire 6 min. If you want to check out some quality No Limit material try some Kane and Abel ""Am I My Brothers Keeper"" or try Soulja Slim ""Give it to Em Raw""."
4,Tight cd!,"Alright, I gotta admit that I didn't listen to this album that thoroughly when I first reviewed it. But I listened to it more and I think that most of the songs are really tight! The songs I like the most are I'm A Soldier, Give Me The World, Just Be Straight With Me, If I Don't Gotta, You Ain't Gotta Lie To Kick It, Let Me Hit It, What Gangstas Do, Who Can I Trust, It Ain't My Fault, and Who I Be. Y'all gotta check this out today!"
3,Good cd,"I love No Limit, and this is a good cd, but I think it was way overrated. A lot of the songs could have been better, but this cd does have some tight songs, like I'm A Soldier, Give Me The World, Just Be Straight With Me, and It Ain't My Fault. It's a good cd, but it could have had some better songs. Check it out!"
4,IT WAS GOOD BUT I LIKED THA FIRST ONE BETTER,"LET ME SAY I LOVE SILKK, HE IS SO FINE.I LIKED SOME OF THA SONGS ON THIS CD. MY FAVORITES ARE GIVE ME THA WORLD, IF I DON'T GOTTA, IT AIN'T MY FAULT, LET ME HIT IT, AND JUST BE STRAIGHT WIT ME. I THINK HE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER."
1,Silkk da Shocker can't RAPP!!,"I'm sorry but Silkk da Shocker can't rapp at all. All he do is scream. I really don't mean to player hate, but he can't rapp. The only songs I like by him were ""IT AIN""T MY FAULT"" and ""LET ME HIT IT"". That's only because Mystikal was in it;which Mystikal help bring Silkk's voice. I'm sorry,but he can't rapp and that's the bottom line.Also I don't see why girls go crazy over him. He's not all that,but Mystikal is sorry.Also let me get supmtin' strait I'm not a music fan of Silkk da Shocker,but I'm a fan of Mystikal."
4,bertz25,"Silk is so fine! but his music is not verry fine, I like it but only because I hear his voice, he can rap but he need more skills like P, he could use some tips from his Bro. other than that he can stay the same.-SILK I LOVE U SO MUCH - lot of love. Amber Pavlat."
3,"2 Crowded, but that's a good thing","This album starts off with a strong anthem song but fades in and out throughout the album. The long list of guest appearances is a good thing for this album because Silkk cannot carry the entire album by himself. Silkk's lyrics are wack and don't make any sense(see my review for ""Bout' It Soundtrack""). But for what it is worth you do get to hear some great lyrics by the NL All-Stars(MP,Fiend,Mystikal,MiaX,C-Murder,Mac,and so on). POINT BLANK: THIS IS NOT A SILKK THE SHOCKER ALBUM MORE OR LESS A NL COMPILATION ALBUM."
5,Amazing,"*wrote a review before, but never got added, so here's a shorter version* Like everyone else said, this album is amazing. Easy listening, yet provokes thought. One of those CDs you can put on replay. It's definitely worth your money and ears. =) Thanks to Matt for reassuring the world that real music is still out there."
5,simply amazing,"i have to agree with what everyone else said about how amazing this album is. i bought the cd not knowing what to expect, but was completely blown away by not only the music, but by the passion that is so clearly found in it. no two songs sound alike, which is why i could listen to the cd over and over again. thanks matt for giving us an incredible piece of who you are and for reassuring the world that there's real music out there."
5,He's Got Soul,"I just accidentally came upon this album, then decided to buy it. I can't believe we haven't heard more about Matt Morris. With rich vocals, good beats and interesting lyrics, this is a good pick for any day!"
5,Matt is Back!!,"Ok well I have not heard the whole cd yet but from what I have heard, it is sooo FABULOUS!! ""You wont be there"" and ""Eternity"" are my favorites! Matt's voice is absolutly amazing and I know he will do great! I recommend buying this cd, it is so worth it! You will be mezmerized by his great voice...Nobody can sing like Matt, and no one can take his amazing style for writing...I give it 5 stars!"
4,An Excellent Review or Preparatory Book For Algebra II,"This book really helped me prepare for Algebra II. With the help of this book, I had a 97% in the first semester and a 94% in the second. Then at the end of the year, this was a great tool in reviewing for the final."
2,Many typos,There is at least one typo in every chapter and some chapters have multiple mistakes. The chapter on logarithms even has an example that they forgot to include the answer to and there was a mistake in the chapter on conic sections that made me think I was going crazy. Normally I'd be a little forgiving but COME ON. This is math. Having mistakes in a math book can really mess with people's heads.
3,Albebra II Cliff Quick Review,The book has some good notes but is not as complete as I was wishing. This particular vender took longer to get the book to me than any I have ever used on Amazon however. It took 3 full weeks. I have never waited that long. May have to go buy another book to help my daughter but this one was cheap enough.
2,Grip-Rite GR08RHG Round Head 2-3/8-Inch by .113-Inch by 21 Degree Plastic Collated Ring Shank Hot-Dip-Galvanized Framing Nail,These nails were of very poor quality. The galvanize was ok. The ring shank was almost nonexistant. Many of the nails were totally smooth. The others had marks where the rings belonged but were nothing more than a small dent in the nail. If I purchased the nails locally I would have returned them.
2,a light weight read,I found the book to have all the depth of a Saturday afternoon coffee and gossip woman's group. While amusing it only attempted to skim the top most layer of it's subject. I would save my money and pass by this and future offerings by this author.
3,Thomas the Tank Engine,Bought this for my Grandson to play with in the cold winter months to keep him busy. He is a 2yo and he seemed to enjoy it but like any 2yo his attention span did not stay on playing in it too long. Maybe that will change the older he gets. Bottom line he liked it and did play well in it.
5,Dr. Progoff has a vast mind.,"I would say that until a person has read The Psyche As Sacrament: A Comparative Study of C.G. Jung and Paul Tillich (Studies in Jungian Psychology), and has become familiar with both the leanings and orientations of both, then the Cloud of Unknowing would remain an esoteric and more or less inscrutable account of the inner life of a mystical relationship between man and God. This would remain true unless of course a person had already attained a particular view on the mystical and spiritual by experience, through which then his/her understanding will unfold as granted according to the need."
1,Weird and not much information,"I was disappointed in this book, it was weird and I got very little information out of it. Maybe I thought it was going to be about something else but in my opinion, it's not very spiritual or informative unfortunately."
2,another exploitation of fischer s name,"i am very disappointed from this book. Its title seemed to me very promising but nothing matched my expectations. This book contains a lot of chess interviews some interesting some not..But nothing more, it is just a collection of interviews that the author- a known chess journalist- has taken through out his career. Moreover he uses the very marketable name of bobby fischer inspite that only a brief part of the book is refering to him. Save your money for something else...."
1,Judgmental and rigid,"I'm sorry to rate this book so low, because the author understands basic astrological mechanisms, but possibly not all that deeply. The author has a very stubborn, all-or-nothing approach to every planetary interaction which seems to show a lack of appreciation for how multivalent these symbols are. The author's tone and approach are so insensitive, unpleasant and arrogant that it really turned off this reader. With experience with clients and charts, the astrologer may find that relationships are more complicated than the author credits, and it is not the place of the astrologer to judge them, but rather to explain them."
5,The Secret Place:Passionately Pursuing HIs Presence,I really liked this book. It encourages you to know there are greater and deeper encounters with God that you can have and a deeper place in Him where you can live. I shared it with a friend and she decided in the first few pages she wanted the book for herself and another friend to have to read and re-read.
1,"Starts,good but declined rapidly","At first it seemed like it was going to be a nice guide to developing a personal relationship with God. However, I soon got the feeling that the author was trying to make himself appear to the reader as some kind of chosen one. There are a lot of scriptural references to support the author's story. I just felt that the author's purpose quickly turned into fulfilling a personal mission to be seen as someone more important than the rest of us --- setting himself apart and putting himself into the category of a prophet. It did not help me at all in my personal spiritual growth."
5,Great book! Worth reading.,"This is mostly a journey of a man entering into the presence of God, not a lecture on ""How to"" but the actual example of how a simple man did it, showing us that it is not only possible, but highly necessary to get into the presence of God, seeking intimacy with Him, if we want a victorious life. And this is a daily struggle, not something you do once and you got it made. It is a life style that you develop. Is it easy? For some may be, for some it may be very difficult, but the degree of difficulty is totally irrelevant, for the reward is much higher than whatever this world has to offer."
2,Sad Name,"Not really worth purchasing. If you have a friend with this joint then you can just borrow theirs. I'm not a fan of bootlegging so be forewarned, this is a waste of time watching. The only reason it got a 2 is because I still support my black people.."
1,Don't do it,This is good to just watch once not even. It's just a lot of people talking garbage and they don't tell a good story.
1,the logic of hate,"This book should be titled ""the Logic of Hate"". It is full of bitter venom towards all people who are of the wrong skin color. The author should go to ""attitude reeducation"" school to get rid of his hate."
5,WOW!!!,"Wow!!! May I say bravo to this author! This is a very intriguing and moving story. This author is so desriptive, it as though she has painted a picture. The events come to life!"
4,I'd like to share it with friends,"This movie has a lot going on -- the music, the romance, the city of Paris, some really great actors and a really good feel. Poitier and Newman are a little seedy and very worldly, while Carroll and Woodward are naive and easy. Everyone's just looking for a good time. It made me feel as if I was the one on vacation in Paris. The plot is good and I kept trying to guess how things might end up. As always, Louis Armstrong stole the show during his scenes. I really want to share this movie with my family and friends. I can't find it to rent. I'd love to have it on DVD."
4,a good duke,"I did know this record, it was a good surprise for me.I receive this Cd more quickly than it was precised, a another good surprise. Thanks"
3,"Good teacher, bad accent","Despite my quibbles with this package, I learned a lot of French from it! I think Mr. Frobose has a very good system for learning, although a bit repetitive. His French speaker is charming and very easy to understand, but Mr. Frobose's French accent is bizarre. Fortunately, he lets his native speaker do the demonstrating. I was irritated by the errors in the tapes (you can't rewind and re-record?) and by the wasted space on them, and by the frequent references to a text that doesn't accompany this package. A far better cassette course, smooth, polished, and even entertaining, is the Pimsleur course put out by Sybervision, but it's also much more expensive."
5,Timeless,"This book compiles some of Olson's best writings. In it, his last book, Olson further explores the concept of self-reflection and self-discovery through wilderness solace. His writing will be of interest to anyone who enjoys the outdoors (especially canoeing), but also readers who enjoy general contemporary philosophy."
2,Am trying a new brand,"I have been buying these for quite some time and was pleased with them until my most recent order. Alas, the formula appears to have changed and now there is a *very* strong ginger smell and taste to the caplets. I know ginger is good for me and I don't mind it as an ingredient but I absolutely do NOT want to taste it. Even if I gulp down an entire tall glass of water I can't escape the biting ginger flavor left in my mouth. Digestive enzymes don't do any good if you are reluctant to swallow them so I'm going to try ""Doctor's Best"" and hope it's a good product."
1,Caused severe gas,"I gave this product a try to aid in digestion and my Crohn's. I tried different doses from high to low but it kept yielding the same results... severe abdominal gas! I experimented with the product for 2 weeks and my body was unable to acclimate to it. I have tried other Garden of Life products with great results but this one, IMHO, is not worth it."
1,"Good product, bad seller?","I have bought this product many times and this was definitely a bad batch. The caplets were more friable than others I have bought. However, as the bottle seals were intact, and it was not even close to the expiration date, I attributed the product's condition to being roughly shipped. The more I used it, however, the more it didn't smell right, look right. It almost seemed as if it had been water damaged and then dried out. Upon closer examination, it appeared that the Lot # had been altered. At this point it was too late to do much about it, as half the product was used up, but I will not buy from this seller in the future."
2,Pleasant Valley,This may be a good product but the caplets are so large I cannot swallow them. I tried chewing them and the taste was just so horrible I had to spit it out. I do not recommend this product for anyone who cannot swallow very large pills.
3,Meh.,"I installed this on a 1991 Honda Accord. My dad almost broke it trying to fit it where it was suppose to go. My dad is not a professional, but he has done more than enough installations to know that this did not fit very well. It stays put, but the radio is sticking out a bit. The only thing that we really needed was the the part with the cubby. All the others did not do anything to help the installation even though in the instructions it tells you to use this and that."
3,Gets the job done.,"Ordered this kit for my 96 Honda Accord. Came with an installation guide. Not the best write up, but you can figure it out, no rocket science here. As to the product itself, made of cheap plastic. Build quality is ok, but then it gets the job done and doesn't look too bad. Definitely worth the money."
1,1993 honda accord ex wagon,"This product is junk. Woundn't use the directions to wipe my rear with. Cheap plastic. Rear mount does not work (atleast in my dash). Had to cut bottom of original radio and use orignal mount. Is only sturdy because of the extra bracing I put in. Not a very secure mount with this kit. Would not use at all but, car was apart so had to make work."
3,"good, but could be better","The item is of decent quality. takes a couple mins to figure outBut what i found a problem with was that it came with no screws to fasten the stereo to the Dash kit,so for now, this product it useless to me."
2,not a great fit,"Fit for my 97 Honda Accord EX was a ""close but no cigar"" fit. Cheap plastic offers marginal support. I used this to mountPioneer DEH-1300MP CD Receiver with MP3/WMA Playback and Remote Control. You may have to disregard the instructions and play with some of the parts to get things to work depending on your stereo."
1,Improper Description.,This does not fit my 1997 Honda CRV. From looking in the manual the part needed is Metra 99-7893 one number above this one.
2,Don't buy for '95 Odyssey,"Bought this since it was supposed to fit a 1995 Odyssey. It didn't fit. Huge disappointment, but at least I was able to secure it with cable ties. Cup holder won't go in now, so I'll be looking for a different dash kit down the road. Otherwise, it's a mediocre quality dash kit. Make sure you read the manual for the correct dash kit model, or you'll end up cutting tabs you shouldn't."
4,Exactly as described,"I used this for my 92 acura vigor. Works great. It comes with a little booklet that tells you which parts you'll need to use depending on your car model. In the car now, the cubby hole is great to have and it fits seamless into my dash"
1,Arrived Broken,Who ever made the decision to package the kit inside of a plastic bag made a terrible blunder. It arrived broken! No one should ever put such of a flimsy fragile piece of plastic in a bag and ship it across the country! (seriously this thing feels like it would be easier to break then a china tea cup.)
5,Great fit in 1996 Honda Accord,"Purchased this to install radio in my 1996 Honda Accord. Worked great, mounted solid and looks fantastic!I would highly recommend this product for an Accord like mine."
1,did not fit,"i bought this product because it stated it would fit my 1998 civic, it didn't because it is a dx model. this was not stated in the review. my installer said i should have checked with the manufacturer of the product to make sure it fit my dx. Luckely he had the proper kit to install my pioneer unit the right way."
4,Functional and does just what you need it to,"I used this along with the wiring harness adapterMetra 70-1720 Radio Wiring Harness For Honda/Acura 86-98 Power 4 Speakerto install a new stereo in my 96 Accord. The instructions were a little bit of a headache but mostly I just test fit before I cut anything, and test fit again as I went. I feel the support strength could've been a little better, but it definitely did exactly what I needed it to do and supported the new unit adequately in the space as well as fill in the space where the double decker OEM unit used to be with a nice functional pocket."
4,"Great for the Office, School or Home!",These are great pencils. They do a great job of displaying the team logo and the colors are very bright. The item arrived in a timely manner and I would highly recommend the pencils and the seller!
4,"great toy, but as far as availability.....","All these Legends figures are really the ultimate in action figures. Unfortunately, if you order them from Toys r us, and thus Amazon, the release date will come and go and then the delays will begin in earnest. So shop elsewhere but get 'em!"
4,one thing i want changed,my only peeve is the paint on it i wish the have a better paint job on him any1 knows how to paint a figure? im looking 2 paint mine
2,Sound Quality OK...toxic smell,"The sound quality is decent for the cheap price, and the volume does get loud (although with a little bit worse quality when loud). The speakers have a strong toxic smell (from the cloth covers) that does not go away."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"I had to return these Creative Labs Inspire 245 Multimedia Speakers. I have to say that Amazon was very quick with processing the refund. As all us know, you get what you pay for. The speakers squeaked and scratched but didn't produce much noise beyond that. I wouldn't waste my time or money these again. Thumbs down!"
3,Well this is not the best place to start with his music...,"This is not the best sample of his big range of styles and is also quite heterogonous, as for the presence of live songs and those ones from the studio...but it's so much cheap that it can be the first place to start with such a small but important extract from his unforgettable career...after this one you can buy the other official studio albums,also in the double CD-format!!Not essential, but it's anyway interesting!!"
2,"A ""Zappa Sampler"" is an oxymoron!","To take chunks (generally unrelated) of Zappa's music and hail it as a good intro misses the point.Much of what he did needs to be heard within the overall context of the music contained within a particular album. That's how this genius worked.If you want a true starting point to hear the full range of Zappa, begin with ""We're Only in it for the Money"" (original mix) or ""Uncle Meat"". These are the best ""introductions"" to the man and his music.The great proportion of the music on this cd doesn't come close to his best work. Moreover, most of it represents the silly, toilet humor that typically appeals to stoned out/drunken male undergrads.Zappa was much more than ""Don't Eat Yellow Snow""!!!This recording is exactly what the title suggests...nothing more than cheap thrills."
3,Anti-hits,"3 1/2Even if this is not considered a great Zappa compilation, and even though I hate compilations in general, this was, and still is a highly impressive sampler of a highly influential, highly original, highly warped, and highly eclectic artist."
4,Great Zappa intro....,This gives you a pretty good idea about what Zappa is all about. I bought it because it was the cheapest of his discs. The guitar solo on Zomby Woof is worth the price alone. He is definitely one beeezare persona as this disk shows.
5,BUY IT!,"What's fantastic about this cd is ""Joe's Garage"". This live version is edited in such a way that if you hit repeat on your cd player it plays seamlessly....FOREVER!"
4,Vintage Zappa,"I came to Zappa as a child when he was in his prime, and came back as an adult just as impressed with his clever ideas, musicianship and ideas. I love his sense of humor and irreverence. I have only owned two Zappa albums but will probably purchase more since listening to this one."
3,"Not bad, but not great either...","I had higher hopes for this dvd. The blending of occult subject matter, male nudity and black & white photography sounded very intriguing and surely a must-have for my collection. And while it remains in the library, not something I'll be watching again soon. The short films are very low-budget and experimental, which makes it a keeper. But there's not a lot of substance to it and at times it appears as though the models are trying to figure out what to do, obviously getting little direction from the filmmaker. Not nearly as entertaining as Greenwood-Copper's ""Exhibition"" (a great dvd!), but not horrible either."
5,A wonderful story,"One of Astrid Lindgren's best books, deserves to be better known and more widely circulated. The characters are realistic, and the story carries them through difficult times into an ending that is satisfying as it is surprising. Bravo!"
5,Thoroughly Satisfied!!!,"I was a little skeptical about ordering a $60 9-cell battery as this sounded to good to be true. Manufacturers cost was $149. However, it works great and as advertised. I can't claim it provides 5 hours of usage because I haven't timed it, but it is far superior to the 6-cell battery included at time of purchase. The physical size is larger and it extendes beyond the back of the laptop but only slightly. Overall, I would highly recommend this battery. (Purchased thru Office Depot online via Amazon)"
1,Expected more - based on Lenovo claims!,"Lenovo claims that this battery provides up to 5 hours of battery life...How about just 3 hours! With light to medium use (no more then 2 programs running), the battery provided only 3 hours of time on a Lenovo Vista notebook. Disappointing!"
4,Try different juices for flavor,"I definately appreciate this product for the good feeling I have after using it; it is a solid player in my detox routine. I first tried mixing it with apple juice but did not like it. I think it goes well with blueberry, bilberry, raspberry or cherry juices. It's not something I want to sip, I just shake a scoop with 6 oz or less of juice in a small Mason jar and knock it back. No big deal. My wife likes to mix it half and half with Kyo Green and she likes the flavor better that way.Several different merchants sell this on Amazon, be sure to check the price because it varies greatly."
5,Best on the market,"I picked this up from Whole Foods 2 weeks ago after trying many green formulas and it is by far the best. For the people complaining about taste what do they expect from a product like this? You and not drinking it for taste but for what it does and my energy is way up and it tastes fine. Also for a container 1/2 the size offered here I paid $36.99 and it was on sale, it is reg $46.99! So Amazon has a great price as well."
3,"amazing ingredient, difficult to swallow","First I have to say that I have tried over 5 different greens products. Although some of them have been quite tasty and some hard to swallow this one is in a league of its own. Extensive search for the best ingredient has lead me to try this one. The sprouted and raw ingredients were unique and hard to pass up, and prime shipping was an added bonus. But honestly my wife and I do not know if we will reorder, its that bad tasting. The first time I tried it I was shocked how bad it was and actually gagged on it halfway through the cup, up it came all over my work clothes, its that bad. I found like others that juice masks it well, although this is really not the most healthy and pretty counter productive. The healthy and best method I found so far is a mixture of 75% water 25% lemon juice, masks it pretty well but it still a pinch your nose and down it experience."
2,horrible taste,"I drink a glass of these super green powders every day, and they really work. I have more energy, and I don't even get a cold anymore. I have tried different powders. None of them taste very good, but it is still OK to drink them mixed in water. I like to use water so I do not add calories every day just for these green drinks. I am sure this green powder is of similar quality as the others, but the taste is so bad, that I gaged when I drank it the first time. I did not give up right away though. I tried for a few more days, but eveytime I swallowed this, I got nauseated from the taste, and felt sick for about one hour. I gave up. This is so vile, it is just not worth it. There are many other good products out there which taste a lot better."
2,Yuck!...Sorry....,"My immune system was so low this last winter I had to do something. Being a picky eater, I couldn't just completely change my diet overnight, but I did start to change it some. I have tried daystar botanicals, ALIVE!, and now this Garden of Life product. The other products worked well to get my immunity up (I haven't had so much as a sneeze or cough since January), but I thought I would look for a product that didn't cost as much per bottle (free shipping too!). I have now taken the product twice (mixed with apple juice) and both times I have had to really focus in order to keep it down (remember the picky eater thing). I am going to try this for a few more days just to really give it a chance. I was impressed by the ingredients and would like to see if there is a difference in the way I feel compared to the other products. I will try to update this in the next week."
4,Different strokes for different folks....,"I'm so surprised at all the folks who say this stuff tastes terrible. I tried it after using another brand for quite a while and was so delighted at how much better it tastes than the other kind! I mix with milk and psyllium. As always with psyllium, you have to drink it fast or the psyllium gums up."
1,Ordered a week ago and it still has not shipped!,"I like this actual product, however, I placed this order a week ago and it hasn't even begun to ship yet!?!? What the heck??! And I have no idea whom to call or contact... verrry frustrating. I guess I will just cancel this order and pay the $18 more from Whole Foods. Why advertise something as being ""in stock""??"
5,I don't understand the big fuss about the taste,"I mix almond milk, strawberries, bananas, and a scoop of this super green formula and have no problem drinking it. It's actually tasty. If you are a smoothie drinker, go for it.I use a blender and frozen fruit to make it creamy. Try it and stop whining."
2,"If you are gluten intolerant, avoid this product!","The label on the container says ""gluten free"", but like a lot of things, if you have problems with gluten intolerance then check the ingredient label. There you will find wheat and barley grasses, which in of themselves do not trigger reactions, but can contain seeds, which are the source of the gluten. Are you going to tell me they catch every seed that goes through?I bought this as an addition to my morning protein shake and from the first day I started using it I felt HORRIBLE! Fatigue, diarhea, nausea, all the symptoms that told me I had consumed something with gluten. I finally tracked down the only possible culprit, which is this product. ANYTHING that includes any form of wheat or barley is not safe to eat for a person with gluten issues. The fast and loose labeling protocols for the food industry have once again done us a great disservice."
1,Allergy Alert,"Read the label carefully and consult with your medical doctor.When I took this product I had the worst cystic acne of my life. Turns out that these ingredients: Kamut Grass, Wheat Grass, Barley Grass, Oat Grass, Alfalfa Grass, Spirulina, Chlorella, Oats, Barley, Rye, Millet, Buckwheat, wreaked havoc with my body.So, if you have the slightest sensitivity to certain foods, carefully read the label. It took years of agony to realize that the Perfect food wasn't helping me, it was harming me."
3,"The product is great, if you can get it down!!","The stuff is as good for you as it is bad to taste. You will not find it easy to swallow, unless you find a way to make it taste better. It's gross... Just a forewarning. But, seriously... how many people actually like what is good for them? Vegetables for instance... great for you, but only if you can manage to get it down in the first place. Otherwise, I'm tempted to feed this stuff to my guinea pigs... I'm sure, as herbivores they will find the stuff rather tasty!"
1,Better things out there,"Tastes awful, expensive, and why not just use pure chlorella and/or spirulina powders? Those are the best ingredients in this and any other green food supplement/superfood that is worth anything. Kelp, wheatgrass, alfalfa, are great, but not as good as algae powders. I consider them fillers for green drinks and now prefer straight spirulina or chlorella."
1,Worst tasting grass ever!,"Even with a juice or flavored drink, the over powering taste of alfalfa makes this mix difficult at best to swallow. Different grasses make up this mix. It would have better to see more sea kelp or spinach in this mix."
5,My Favorite Product!,"i usually do not write reviews on my purchases but i want to share my opinions on this product. i am 23 years old and like to live as healthy as possible. i think green drinks such as this are healthier than multivitamins and i actually feel healthier after drinking this. This is the best product i have ever bought for my health. I drink it every morning as soon as i wake up. this is not a miracle product but it's full of vitamins and other healthy stuff that i probably dont even know about. Fair warning-- this product does not taste good. Once you taste it you will be able to tell that it is very healthy ( honestly tastes like algea and broccoli ). if u r someone who cares about what your green drink tastes like go elsewhere. otherwise, if u r like me and care only about the health benefits and want the best product for the money you pay, this is what u want. there are green drinks cheaper but they're far less effective in my opinion. hope this helps."
3,Deception or manufacturing mistake?!?!!?!?!,Seller was great...product was ok...I guess...what I am VERY disappointed with is the fact that there were 44 servings NOT 60 as indicated on the container!!!! I measured exactly as directed as well. I'm meticulous with those things and 44!! 44!! 44!!! Contacting company and seller!!
4,HEALTHY BUT NOT GREAT TASTING,THE PRODUCT MIXES EASILY .THE TASTE IS OK.I DONT THINK THERE ARE MANY OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE BETTER TASTING.I INTEND TO BUY IT AGAIN
3,Just okay,I've tried Barlean's and a few other supergreen powders. This particular one gives me a slight headache after a few days and I need to take a break from it now and again.
2,Good but bad,"I have tried this product at least three separate times. Each time I have the same problem; I get diarrhea that takes weeks to get rid of. I don't mind the taste, am confident of the company (I've taken their probiotic for years) but for some reason this particular product, which I would like to take because of its alkaline nature and ""green-ness,"" just causes havoc with my system. I can take a very small amount, like a half teaspoon, without a problem, but if I work up to half a scoop, I get the runs. I've encountered one other person, a medical professional who has a *very* good diet, who had the same problem.But it won't hurt you to give it a try; just don't buy a huge quantity to start with. If it works for you, it should be a great product."
4,"If made right, it's a perfect drink...","I mix a scoop of Perfect Food with a banana and orange juice with ice in the blender everyday.. it tastes good, it gives you solid veggie and fruit servings, and it wakes you up a little as well... pricey but worth it if you are serious about your health..."
3,God stuff,"Great stuff for you. Here's what I do to increase the health benefits and taste. I blend it into a smoothie with bluberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and a banana. I add a scoop or two of the powder. It tastes much better and the antioxidents in the berries are a huge plus."
2,Just couldn't do it,"I bought Perfect Food to up my greens intake and to accompany a detox/cleanse that I am doing. The taste is so bad, I just can't keep drinking this stuff! The first time, I mixed it with some blended veggies and fruits and was able to choke it back. I tried it with plain water and YUCK!!! I tried regular bottled, organic apple juice and NOPE. Finally, I tried mixing it in with unsweetened almond milk. After being close to gagging every time I drank this stuff, I finally gave up. I consider myself pretty tolerable of ""gross"" foods, especially when it comes to better health. But this stuff is just nasty! On another note, Garden of Life makes an antioxidant berry mix and this one isn't bad at all. But I'll be looking for another brand of green food to try."
3,descent slasher flick,"while i was bored at work i decided to watch the mutilator to kill some time. the movie has a typical slasher plot for the day it was made. the movie centers around a boy who accidentally kills his mother with his father's shot gun thus causing a series of murders years later. the acting is lackluster and the kills are cheesey which is ok considering the genre of the movie; however, the happy music at the end is rather annoying."
3,uncut.,"First off, I was made a DVD copy of the uncut version of the movie, so this review will reflect that uncut version.The movie has alot of the vintage ""camp"" slasher movies aspects to it, although the characters are twenties and going to a beach house for a get away. One by one the become missing, subjected to brutal deaths.The uncut version has some pretty bloody scene, a nice decapitation scene and alot of nice blood.A great addition to any fan of slasher movies, but I wouldn't shell out more than $5 for this video."
4,Great Tone - Long Life,"I received a free sample of these strings in 1997. I didn't believe the hype, so I was reluctant to put them on. I was playing my acoustic one day and I broke the high E string, so I decided to try out the pack of Elixirs. As I was tuning up, I noticed they sounded bright and clear, without a lot of string noise. All new strings sound good when you first change them, but my guitar never had sounded that great to me. Even the low strings seemed to have a more presence without buzzing. They also lasted a lot longer than other brands I'd used. A thin plastic coating helps prevent them from corroding from finger oil. Everything that's printed on the package is true."
5,Elixir's Can't Be Beat,I've been using these strings on my acoustics almost since they were first introduced. My fingers perspire heavily and normal strings don't last long for me. The Polyweb coating on these strings makes them last for months. The Nanoweb version has a thinner coating and plays a little 'brighter' but still has the longevity built in. Best string on the market for acoustic as far as I'm concerned. Amazon usually has the best price.
5,great book,"This is an easy read and one of the best I've read. Use your high lighter pen, if you have employees that don't read, at leat they'll read the high lights."
4,Relationship selling works,"Great ""back-to-basics"" book. No big revelations, but wonderful reinforcement that will help all salespeople who are selling in an environment where relationships really count."
5,This guy should be huge,"Great songs, great vocals and some stunning guitar playing. Nothing but good news. Why bands like GUNS and ROSES hit it soooo big, when far more talented and interesting musos like SALAS labour in obscurity, beats me. This is anthemic stadium rock without the childish lyrics and silly posturing by the aforementioned. Maybe he should complain about childhood abuse and wear a permanent sneer."
5,Storm The Marvel Legend we've all been waiting for.....,Perfect sculpt. Tons of articulation. Variant Mohawk also available too boot. Thank you Toy Biz you've made this fan very happy.
1,bad shelves!!!,"this product would not fit properly in our corners. bad product would not recomend. to heavy to ship back, not even worth it!"
4,GOOD BOOK,GOOD BOOK IF YOU'RE GETTING A NEW PUPPY!! GIVES GREAT TIPS ON WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU FIRST BRING YOUR NEW PUPPY HOME AND COMPLETE SHOPPING LISTS OF THINGS TO HAVE BEFORE THE PUP GETS HOME AND WHAT TO PACK WHEN TRAVELING.
3,"Too tight, don't buy it unless your phone is very thin","This cell phone holder is too tight. I would not recommend to buy it unless your phone is very thin. It is hard to get it out of the holder when the phone rings... It looks ok, a little too large for an average size cell phone, it covers all including the antenna."
1,Understanding Green Consumer Behaviour: A Qualitative Cognit,"This book is OK with loverly Braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanding, any questions?"
4,Solid cd,"Here's another cd where it has tracks that aren't on the best of cd which are better than the one's that are on it. These tracks are spirit slips away, a king's venegence, for thos who love to live..not that wild one, fighting or roslaie are bad songs they are good.. just I like the other one's better. Ballad of a hard man is hard rocker with southern rock flavor to it. Silver dollar and freedom song are good but not great."
4,3.5 stars,"Not their strongest effort, but it has its strong points in songs like the gritty and aggressive ""Suicide"" and the soulful ""Wild One."" ""Ballad of the Hard Man"" is a pretty strong closer, too.It's a good album for the big fans of the band, but not where I'd start a new fan."
2,Not overly impressed,"The unit does what it's supposed to and for a non tech person it was easy enough to set up but there was some problems getting the correct configuration initiqally which was very frustrating. I had a standard ADSL modem supplied by the provider and then decided to ""upgrade"". I never had connection problems with the ADSL modem, now I get disconnected continuously and have to reconnect or reboot my PC. I would not recommend this product, there are a lot of good networking products out there, this is not one of them."
2,Very Poor Range,"I have it mounted on a wall in my study about 6 feet away from my computer, about 7 feet from my modem and monitor. I did that to minimize the possibility of EMI. My Dell laptop has a new Linksys 2.4 GHz WPC54G notebook adapter. At 6 feet away it has 100% signal, at 12 feet it has 54% signal, at 35 feet away it has 18% signal, at 50 feet way it has 1% signal and stops working. I have 900 MHz and 5.8 GHz phones. I live in a condo 1335 sq. feet. I did not see an advertised range for this item. If I would have been aware that it has such a short useful range, I would never have purchased it. I wouldn't buy another one or recommend it. I will wait until something better comes along."
4,Simply love this one,"Linksys is a great brand name and they always deliver good products. This one is no different. I bought this through amazon on a great deal, with $30 off on credit it came around 10$.I have the same problem of weak signal with the router while replacing with a Belkin b router. But this can be easily resolved using an antenna attached to it. There is a huge difference in speed is visible while using this. Signal quality can be tremendously increased with the antenna.Not very happy about antenna sold seperately, but at least they provided a space for fixing the antenna.Overall I am a happy customer."
3,"Great size, but questionable performance","I bought this router because it was so small and would free up some more space on my crowded desk. It was also very inexpensive. It does give me more space, however I've been having problems with the wireless portion of it.My notebook is 3 feet away from the router, and most of the time the signal is fine. Then, inexplicably, the notebook can no longer see the router. All the while, my desktop PC, which is plugged into the router via one of the ports, has no problems seeing the router.I've upgraded the firmware, but this didn't fix the problem. I'm going to give it a few more days of looking for a solution, and then back to the store with it. I had a 4-year old D-link that I never had a problem with."
4,Excellent Shipping But...,"Amazon, as always had REALLY fast shipping. Thanks! However, the product itself was not up to scratch in my eyes. I have been battling with the wireless part of the router for the past few weeks (ever since I have had it). The 4-port switch works fine, and it is just for my dorm room, but that is the whole point of a WIRELESS router, is it not? I've tried everything short of buying the wireless extender to enhance my range, but I am almost always sitting right next to the stupid thing! Oh well - it's too late to send it back, and I bought a permanent ethernet cord that I can use to hook up my laptop to it."
2,Replacement seems to be working now...,"[Updated 2005-09-12]:Received replacement; this time it is working well. Using WPA-TKIP and the connection is consistently 36-54Mbps with either Very Good to Excellent.[2005-09-07]:After reading some reviews, I decided to get the WRT54GC for 43% off on Amazon. After receiving it ahead of schedule (thanks Amazon and UPS!), I was able to manually set it up pretty quickly (the setup CD doesn't really work well and I have noticed that on a number of Linksys routers).After using it for 30 mins, the wireless failed. I attempted to get it working again, then found out the wired part failed as well. Could not reconnect, reset button would not fix the issue either.My setup is the following:Verizon DSL Westell modem (C-90)3 WinXP Pro SP2 PC's with DHCP on a Netgear MR814v2"
3,Not for the newbie,"The product itself is fairly good. However, the documentation to guide you in the setup is insufficient, and the enclosed CD has only very basic, practically useless setup instructions that conflict with printed information. I needed to spend several hours of internet research to try to configure security, port forwarding, etc., and even so the results have been incomplete. Linksys should stop assuming that everyone who buys a router is a geek, and improve its setup instructions."
1,weak signal,this product has a weak signal and only proforms with in a couple of feet from the router. and knowing this i would have not brought it.
2,Poor Wireless Throughput,"It works fine as a hardwired router, but wireless throughput is poor. Web pages that display in under a second hardwired can take anywhere from 5 to 20 seconds to display wirelessly. At those speeds surfing isn't much fun. I returned it and replaced it with a Netgear WGR614, which works great (and is $10 cheaper)."
1,No Range,"I bought this a few months ago. It has no range whatsoever. It only really works in the room where it is placed. If I move rooms or stories within my house, I either get no signal or one that is weak and intermittan."
3,satisfied,I need a router which is compact and functional just like the one I boughtNot a bad price waiting for the MIR
4,"Good wireless router, but wished it had stronger signal strength","Relatively easy to setup, but I did need to contact Tech support in order to get the default password - poor documentation I think. I have installed many wireless routers and I almost always have to contact tech support for assistance.Anyway this router works well in my home network, but the signal strength seems weak, maybe I overlooked something or maybe I just need to contact tech support for guidance.Also this router comes packed with a lot of functionality almosgt as much as those commercial Cisco router"
2,Disappointing,"This antenna-less model just doesn't transmit adequately. My two PCs are only some 20 feet apart, with a single wall in between. The signal ranges from barely usable to unusable. Even the expensive addition of an external antenna (which completely negates the savings for this model compared to the next-most expensive model)only brings the performance up to satisfactory.Harry"
1,Continuous resetting!,This router has to be one of the worst. I literally have to reset it everytime I need a wifi connection. Would not recommend to my worst enemy!
3,Could have a stronger signal.,"The router is very small and extremely easy to set up. The signal is not very strong, my house has concrete walls, and I am having problems with the signal."
3,Good compact unit ......that could have been better!!,"The unit works well and very easy to set up. Its compact design makes it ideal for a small office wireless router. It works flawlssly yet why am I giving only 4 stars?? I thought that Linksys should have bundled it with the optional high gain antenna rather than selling it separately. Other than that, its a small compact unit that really works! It can be a travel companion as well.Update: April 3, 2010I tried to get firmware update from linksys site and the unit went caput....it died....locked up and useless. I realized that their are two types of firmwares one for units bought in the US and another outside the US....TO ME THIS IS CRAZY....so when you update you linksys routers....be sure you select properly. When i asked for linksys support I was told it's the end of the unit....it's crazy linksys would do this."
4,Linksys compact - works well,"I have been using this unit for about 6 months - I had it set up for my home network on Comcast. I retired it when I switched to the Verizon FIOS - but after three days with their monstrous wireless router and it interference with my cordless phones, I switched back to this - small foot print, good price - easy to use and set-up - plenty of features - I use both wired and wireless (tivo adapter) - connections. Cloned my mac address of the verizon unit and have had not issues since. Recommend the optional antenna, as the wireless range is limited otherwise."
1,You must be a technical Guru to install this product,You need to be a technical guru to install this product. You also better not call Linksys for their technical support because it stinks. They can't help you what they advertise - printer and file sharing. You are on your own there.
1,Slooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwww,Bought in December 05 for it's size. Thought my intrnet connection was slow until I researched the problem. Spend the few extra dollars and get the WRT54G full size router.
3,Lack of Range,This is a great router if you do not need wireless range. I picked up 3 of these and bought cheap $10 antennas to make the wireless work good. The Linksys brand optional antennas cost almost as much as the routers. Unless you are in the same room do not plan on having the wireless work consistantly with just the internal antenna.
1,Don't buy this!,"Having used many Linksys products for many years I have to say that this router is really crappy. Can't handle many wireless and wired connections at the same time and then freezes so you have to unplug and replug the power connector: Really annoying. It happens all the time. Save your many and frustations. Go buy another product, like the WRT54G (the non compact version) which has two antennas by the way."
2,Low lifespan,Worked for about a year for me. Range was low without any separate antenna. Range is average with antenna. Interface is pretty simple for networking VPN and games.
2,Not a happy experience,"I bought this model about one year ago, and had very hard experience on it. Yes, it is compact and looks cute, but that's all. Because of the size, it comes with only an inner anntena. The signal is very poor and my Thinkpad always got discoonected in my bedroom, which is only 10 feet away from the router and there is no obivous obstacle between them. But my thinkpad works well in other wireless networks. Disconnections happened very often. I have three laptop in my home, two Thinkpads and one DELL, none of them can work well with the router, it was hard to get an IP when two laptops were working together. Now I'm using another router which is also made by Linksys, but it is very stable and I'm happy with the new one."
3,Good router but poor wireless coverage,The installation was easy. CD installation idea is very dumb. One could install w/o the CD too. Configuration was partially automatic. Since I knew what I was doing I finished the rest of the configuration. Surprisingly the wireless coverage is VERY poor. I am sitting 20 feet from the router and I get signal strength of 40%. Totally ridiculous. This is my 4th router and I am tired of returning. The only thing I am going to try is changing the channel to something other than my neighbors use to see if it helps.It looks like there are quite some folks here having the same problem.
2,It worse then the WRT54G.,"Usually I'm okay with Linksys routers, but this one gave me lots of problems when I tried to customize it to my liking. I quickly returned it for a WRT54G and have never been happier."
1,No IP! Horrible!,"I wish I could say something nice. I love Linksys and this box is cute. Everything works great except for the fact that it will not obtain an IP automatically from my cable modem (Toshiba PCX1100U). India's tech support is useless and helpless. Too bad, back to the store..."
2,"DOA, Waiting on return","I have had varing levels of success with the WRT54GC in the past. They are better off for limited use as they are not stable for extended periods of time. I use them because of their compact size, it fits nicely in my laptop case. Then I end up giving them to giving them to my co-workers or friends and then i have to get another. But this time I have received a dead one. This one powers up but it does not establish any links wifi/etho. I am waiting on a return."
4,Still working after 6 years,"I have two of these, and both had been running 24/7 just fine for 5+ years -- one as the main router, with a 10"" Linksys 7db antenna that cost almost as much as the router; the other as an access point only. This week the main router stopped working. Because I had the second, I was able to determine that the problem was a *faulty power supply*.That router is now back in operation with a replacement power supply purchased from powerpayless.com at an irresistible price and delivered to me in two days. Highly recommended. [...]So, WRT54GC owners: know that the power supply may fail before the device does, and don't give up on it if it stops working!I'll be changing out that router for a Netgear N750 that arrived from Amazon today, but I'm certainly going to keep the WRT54GCs around. Useful as spares, access points, and for travel."
1,Poor excuse of a router...,"Scenario 1: I'm in a new apartment, walls are paper thin, router works fine, even through walls (once again, thin sheet rock walls) and down the hallway.Scenario 2: I'm in another apartment, walls are solid, router has no signal around ONE SINGLE corner. I literally have to be in visual line of router in order for me to connect. What are these walls made of? And why isn't this router able to send signals through it?Conclusion: Save your money and get the WRT54GWireless-G Broadband Router instead. I use that in a house from basement to second floor with 100% signal. What a waste of money..."
1,Needs refining,"Out of the box, this router looks impressive. Slim, compact, and aesthetic.However, after setting up the device and connecting, I have noticed the device frequently drops connections. This happens at least twice every half hour. So often that I am going to return this item.Bottom line- it is unstable, unreliable, and needs refinement.There is a reason why it is on sale and has a rebate available on it. Sale execs know that the only way to move this item off the shelf is to entice buyers w/ a special. Knowing that most of the sold units won't be returned (due to the hassle of it), they are willing to gamble that they buyer will give up on it.Buy the regular WRT G router. It is a bit more expensive, but it is tested and proven."
5,"Excelent Product, Best Around, compatible with WRE54G","Ok, simple and to the point.1. The size of this thing is incredible. Freed up almoust an entire shelf from my room (vs the old blue routers)2. I had the WRT54G V2 with the high gain antenas, and the RANGE is practically identical if not a little better.3. My house is big and has big old concrete walls, so signal has always been a problem. This baby takes good care of it and since it is compatible with the WRE54G (Range Extender) Its doing a great job for me.Bottom line, Its a well priced router, if you have other wireless G linksys router the only improvements are the looks and size. I upgraded because im those kind of gadget geeks, but im very happy. Sold my old router for 40 bucks in ebay, so only paid 30 for this one.If you want something 1/5 the size of the older ones, buy it. Just dont expect miracles. It does the same only in a diferent wrapping."
2,Crashes,"Works fine if you don't use WPA. As soon as I enabled WPA, it will crash every few days and require rebooting. Google it, I'm not the only one. (If you don't know what WPA is, learn - unless you don't mind people stealing your internet and passwords. Do not use WEP)Now, what to do if you already have one? It seems to be the DHCP server that crashes. Here's a workaround: set all your IP's as static. I still can't believe linksys hasn't fixed this in a firmware upgrade."
4,Now a brick. DO NOT upgrade the firmware.,"I own this little router and it has served me well on the road for four years or so. Tonight for some strange reason I decided to upgrade the firmware... in the name of security I think it was. Followed instructions and everything went well but then blammo, dead. Is now extremely secure.Hundreds (thousands?) of customers complaining about the same thing in the forums, nothing fixes it. Catastrophe ignored by support. A few people early on able to get them replaced under warranty but dangerous firmware files still on site ready to destroy customer property.If you own this this box, upgrading the firmware is not much different than hitting it with a sledgehammer. Here's just one thread of many:[...]"
5,A definite step up,"I purchased this router after being fed up with my Belkin router. So far, it's been speedy, I haven't had to restart it for no apparent reason, and it has a very small footprint. Also, the signal is quite strong most of the time, even on upper levels of the house. I would, however, recommend getting a signal booster if you'll be connecting wirelessly from far distances. All in all, this is a sturdy router. Plenty of features, somewhat easy to use interface, and minimal setup."
3,Small Area Router,The router was purchased based on specifications given. I realised too late that houses where I'm from are constructed differently (we use block and steel for all walls both interior and exterior). The signal from the router was weak and I had to purchase a high gain antenna to get signal in the bedroom. The signal from the router was steady but coverage is small. Assess your usage before buying. If you are going to be some distance away consider using the regular router rather than the compact model.
4,"Very Good, Very Easy!","Being new to the wireless game, I was hesitant about buying this unit. After himming and hawwing I did infact buy it and I was Very pleasantly surprised. It is very compact and I got it up and running in about an hour (would have been quicker but I need to remember passwords) I have a large home with two laptops, a Wii, and 2 PC's. I works great with the laptops and PC's, works pretty well with the Wii. It is located down stairs in the middle of my home (2000 sq ft) and I can get a signal from just about everywhere in the house. A good, small system that does what it says it should."
2,Not up to Linksys standards,"The market has moved on. However, I just threw two of these routers into the electronic recycling bin, so I'll use the occasion to warn anybody looking at picking up one online.The name of this product implies that you get the reliability and performance of the WRT45 in an compact package. Not so. The box itself is attractive and fits neatly on a desk, but the wireless signal is weak and the response of the unit somewhat slow.The first unit I bought began to fail intermittently after about a year. I bought another to replace it and it bricked immediately upon installing a firmware upgrade (which I was hoping might solve the performance problems with the earlier unit). There are numerous messages in the tech boards about the firmware upgrade problem, though nothing obvious on the vendor site. I set the thing aside, dreading the battle with tech support. Finally, I just threw both of them away."
3,Average router,"Ive been having this year close to 3 yrs now.Guess what its been replaced 3 times by linksys.First time, just 6 months later for some reason it bricked, got a replace.Second one ran for 2 yrs ok, with power reset every 2-3 months butwas fine. But when you apply a upgrade it bricked,Third one is going strong now. No issues so far.Only good thing about this is its cheap and does its job with little hassles.Plenty of bad things to complain from a networking expert config point of view.But not worth to mention for the low cost I got this for.The two replacements I got was for free, so nothing to complain either- ravi"
1,Unreliable,"Very disappointed with the product. The installation software is not compatible with Apple (despite claims to the contrary on this website) and while the customer support people are willing to help, they offer the disclaimer that they do not support Apple systems. Installation was long and tedious, the range is extremely limited (even in a tiny New York apartment the signal fades if I take my laptop two rooms away) and the router seems to require frequent, time-consuming restarting. The whole process has been a pain and has made me reconsider having a wireless network. I cannot recommend this product for use with any Apple computer."
1,Poor Signals,"Do not even try. The router by itself gives a poor signal, and adding a high gain antenna (HGA7S) does not improve the signal gain yet all. It gives me a total upset and ruins my values."
4,Sound piece of equipment,"This works and setup was easy, but to be honest I was expecting more. I upgraded from an older linksys in attempts to increase the range a little. It did, but not by much. You can expect a little increase to the effective range and a touch faster connectivity but beyond that it's the same old. I don't think it warrented the hefty price tag attached to it and the adapter devices, but that's what I get for buying something new on the market. I guess the only major difference between it and my older linksys is the cisco label smack dab on the front of it. Is there anything that company won't buy???"
4,It's great but not perfect,This router works great as a cable router and for wireles short distances but may not work as well if longer distances (over 15') need to be accessed. Then the signal decreases and may need to be amplified. In any case good value for the price.
4,I think it's great!,"This is my first wireless router bought for personal use at home. After receiving the unit, it was a little tricky to set up at first...but I got the hang of it in no time. Once that was done I was connecting instantly via my laptop. I am amazed at how small it is yet the range is good.I would recommend this router to anyone who is looking for a sleek, compact and capable device for home use. Enjoy yours, I know I am!"
5,Better than I remember it!,"I had this ball when I was a kid. Then my dog chewed it up. I tried to block that event out of my memory, but I was haunted by the howl of my deceased Vortex. I finally answered the call of the Mega Howler, and now we are together again. This is the best throwing implement ever invented. Even better than THROTON."
5,It's Inspector Morse. What more is there to say?,"As an Inspector Morse fan, I have started to make a collection of Morse DVDs. I have started with this one. It is typical Morse and If you are not an Inspector Morse fan, Watch this one. It is typical. I think most people will like it if they like English Murder mysteries."
2,Who cares?,"I suppose this is a great movie, since everyone says it is. I found it to be filled with unpleasant people (adults and children), not a single one of whom I found interesting. Nor did I care for any of them, or what happened to them. The whole thing left me cold."
1,"Another boring, exasperating director autobiographies","European directors assume that everyone wants to know how they got started to become such creative geniuses. The movie seems to be bragging: ""I was totally uncontrollable, undisciplined child, but look at the success i have become."" Since i don't think a whole lot of his movies, i find the movie ""400 blows"" pointless."
2,"One of the worst movie endings ever, I mean................ever","Just like most French movies, it just ends, there is no ending, not even a wind down. I guess film was expensive back in those days."
1,Not a very good movie.,"I don't mind slow movies, but this movie is slow + boring and 100% predictable. In my opinion, it's terrible."
4,Intriguing.,"The 400 Blows is a beautiful black and white french film. The cinematography is breathtaking and the acting is glorious. I watched this gem for my College film class a few years back and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The ending is a bit disappointing but this film has always stayed with me, I highly recommend checking this classic out!"
4,A must see for film buffs!,"This film is a wonderful autobiographical look at one of the leaders in the French New Wave, Francois Truffaut. It is a true story about one young lad's delinquency in his attempt to find freedom from authority. The famous freeze-frame ending marks the kid's arrival at freedom and not knowing what to do with it. Great story, great acting, and of course, great directing. END"
4,Another great Criterion release,"This is a review for the Criterion Collection version.This is a great film and Truffaut based it loosely on his childhood. It's populatity also spawned numerous sequels.The film follows Antoine Doniel, a boy about 12 years old as he gets into trouble at school, with his parents and the law. The acting is good andThe restoration of the film quality is also quite good and the acting is also very good.This edition remains out of print but was reissued in the ""Adventures of Antione Doniel"" box set."
4,Media Cabinet,"The design of the cabinet is fantastic and fits all the video and audio equipment. It was a bit difficult to put together, but at least the instructions were complete."
4,hard to put together but otherwise great,"Got mine from Amazon, took less than a week.It came in a single large long box with smaller boxes insides, well wrapped and protected.There was a plastic film covering one of the shelf boards that was torn, but I wasn't sure if that plastic film is supposed to be removed, so I ended up tearing the whole film away.The stand looks very strong, some very minor scratches.The biggest complain for me it is this is so hard to put together. The adjustable shelves do not have a fix slots, so you ended up having to measure it, fit it, adjust it, etc. The so called Guide tool is nothing but a smaller ruler. It ended up taking me 2 full days (10am - 4pm) to finish it. The manuals were sparse, and one of the manuals for the doors were missing, but I ended up finding it from the net.All in all I am quite happy."
1,Steer clear,"I wish I had read these reviews before buying Techtool Pro. It seems rather like a defective product. I had a drive that wouldn't mount, and TTP recognized it, and acted like it could recover it, but when I switched from ""Drive"" mode to ""Volume"" mode, the drive was no longer visible to the software, so it wouldn't perform any tests.(In Drive mode, the problem drive passed all the hardware tests multiple times)I executed the data recovery routine (which took literally all night to run on my 40GB drive, and it found 700+ arbitrary recoverable files from the thousands I had on the drive. It didn't retain the filenames, so it was a crapshoot when recovering any of them (most were superfluous utilities and Word docs, rather than my important files).If you have a defective drive, put your money toward a new drive, rather than this gamble."
1,Created more problems in Tiger than it solved,This program has messed up one disk (that was working perfectly) so badly that even DiskWarrior can't repair it. It has fixed no problems on any disk. Get DiskWarrior and hope that a better version (which is compatible with Tiger) comes along soon.
1,Version 4.01 can kill your drive if you have Tiger,"I used Techtool for years, ats been a good tool... BUT...Long story short, running TTP4.01 on Tiger (OS10.4) turned my quite healthy disk into an UNUSABLE DISK - black screen. A horro show, with no warning whatsoever. Micromat's current version is Techtool 4.1.1, which may or may not be compatable - I've totally lost faith in them. In any case, its unclear whether if you have this happen to you whether the newer version can repair it. I'm certainly not going to risk it again. HERE'S WHAT WORKED: If you have DiskWarrior: You need v3.03. In any case when you try to use it you'll first get an error dialog that STOPS you from using it further (Micromat would have saved this grief if they had an equivalent check) - Mine said ""another disk utility has erased critical directory information"". When I saw that I realized they probably knew how to fix what Techtool had wrought. I wasn't disappointed."
2,Does not play well with Leopard...,"Normally a good product, but be careful, it does not work with Leopard. As of this date there is no patch or fix available from the manufacturer."
1,Do NOT waste your $$$$,"To begin with, TTP is not by any means the only game in town. It is however, going to be the the most expensive or completely useless. Micromat will be happy either way. As a current Micromat customer, I am the proud owner of an expensive utility that worked for all of two months. Leopard broke it completely. When Micromat updated their utility to be compatible with Apple's current OS, they wanted all of us to pay them again. They simply renamed the ""update"" from ""Techtool Pro 4"" r4.5.3 to ""Techtool Pro 4"" r4.6.1 an ""upgrade"". They're also calling their all new ""Techtool Pro 5"" an ""upgrade"". Do yourself a favor, buy Diskwarrior and you'll only have to pay for it just the one time."
4,"LOVE IT, but enough w/the security already.",I loved tech tool but having to re-verify every time I use it is a MAjOR pain.
1,Betz is Lacking,"Although the Betz guide presents a well thought out study plan with a detailed outline of topics to be covered, it lacks any substantial test preparation material. The practice problems are few in number, and 5% - 10% of them contain an error of some kind,(those are just the ones I caught). While the Betz Guide gives a solid outline of items to study, it doesn't provide the summarized material it outlines. I already know what is on the DAT and I can easily come up with a study outline myself. What I need is a study guide that provides me with the information to master the test. Bottom line, the Betz Guide is a terse and abbreviated study aid for an in depth and difficult test. In other words, it is a waste of money. They need to hire a better editor and a few more authors who can tell us what we need to know."
2,too vague,I was really disappointed by this book. It lacked in explanations and examples. Too short to be benefitual.
4,Concise Review,"This book is stripped down and to the point. All the information you need to do a thorough review without all the fluff. I would have rated it a ""5"" if it had more ""Test Yourself"" questions -- but, that's a personal preference (don't let it stop you from buying the book)."
5,An excellent review for the person where algebra is still reasonably fresh in their mind,"While this book will be of little value if you need to learn or significantly re-learn basic algebra, it is an excellent resource if you simply need a refresher to prepare for a competency or placement exam. The coverage is complete though concise; a topic is introduced in as few words as possible and the examples as few as needed. If you have gone through the subject with understanding, then the examples will be sufficient. However, if you are weak in a topic, then the examples will be insufficient, although you will learn that you need to explore the subject in more depth."
2,Yangelis,2 1/2Few invigoratingly transcendent sections do not amend a general slothfulness this new-age-with-sci-fi puts out.
2,Great idea but parents have to do the work,"I bought this for my 4 year old who loves gears very much. We planned to read the instruction together and build it together. Then we found out right away that it is impossible for him to put together or take apart any ""tree trunk"" because you need to have a lot of muscle to do so. Sometimes I found it hard myself. He can put gears on once the frame work is set up. And he seems to enjoy spinning the gears. But if you plan to buy your kid a toy and hope he will go away and build it, forget it. This is not the one. Buy lego instead."
4,Many Tree Pieces,"The toy is about what I'd expected except for one thing: The trees/towers are made of many little pieces that are difficult for kids to put together. In fact they were difficult for adults to do. I'd suggest putting them together once and leaving them that way when packed up. Also, when I read how many pieces there were in different sets I didn't consider the fact that half the pieces in this set were tower structure as compared to base platforms, gears, and monkeys."
4,pleased,"This is a nice durable toy, it is a little hard to put together some of the pieces and one piece was missing, but my child still has loads of fun with it."
2,"Challenging to assemble, frustrating for child to play","It took several hours trying to build this up out of the hundred or so little pieces. Some were missing. It doesn't work the way we anticipated that it would, and that is most likely due to user error with assembly or the fact that it is missing a few pieces."
3,Needs parents help,"My son received this when he was 4and 1/2. He could not set it up on his own. As a parent be prepared to do most all of the work. Once it was up he played, but anything thing that was removed, of course stopped the toy from working. We have put it away and plan to bring it out again in a few years when he can do it himself. I would say best for kids 6 and up."
4,Fun & informative.,"I bought this toy for my 4 1/2 y.o. grandson. It was a bit of a challenge to assemble, but we did it together. He is very interested in how everything works together. The toy is durable and fun and really satisfies his mechanical nature."
2,Not as good as basic set,"I bought this toy for my 5 year old boy. He loves the basic gears set and loves to build things with it so I thought this would be great. I thought he would enjoy making the set larger and having the gears move something. Other reviews for it were good. However, when he opened it on Christmas morning it wasn't something he could just put together and make work himself. His dad had to sit down and help him put it together because there's only one way to make it all work right so you have to follow directions. It's not great for just being creative with like the basic set. So after you spend all that time setting it up, you crank the handle a few times and watch the monkeys go around and that's it. The kids lose interest pretty fast and then you either have to find a place to leave it out, or just put it away. It's not really something they can just get out and be creative with and then put away. I wish I would have spent my money on another basic set."
5,Powerful and Exciting,"Imagine a Stephen King thriller if Stephen King were a man of faith! All the elements of a thriller, with compelling, likeable characters,(also some evil ones), and the presence of God and Satan revealed in everyday life.This a book you won't want to put down, and will wait anxiously for the next sequel."
2,Lots and Lots of Room for Growth,"A rambling, bewildered hodgepodge of schlock from the dead center of mainstream evangelical Christianity. The characters are drawn fairly well; at any rate, they're better than the pompous angels and demons who pop up every now and again to provide sonorous intonations on the action. The author has created a universe where everything is as it should be if party-line evangelicalism were true; everyone who disagrees with the Christians either caves in to its obvious superiority or becomes a demon puppet. For its few dubious strengths, the book in the end reads like a lengthy gospel tract clumsily stitched together with iffy action sequences. As Christian fiction, it's all right. As fiction, it's way below average."
2,Interesting premise spoiled by amateurish dialog,"I got this book based on the premise, which sounded extremely intriguing. Unfortunately, the book appears to be badly in need of both editing and rewriting. The characters are wooden and ill-developed. To describe the dialog as stilted would be an insult to stilts everywhere. There are long periods between battle sequences and, said sequences really being the raison d'etre for the entire novel, it's very hard to care about the one dimensional characters whose misadventures and witless spoutings make up the bulk of the novel.There are books that you buy and put on your bookshelf to read and reread over the years. Then there are books that make you glad the library doesn't charge for it's services, because it would be a terrible waste to lay out good money for such atrocious reading. Sadly, this is one of the books in the latter category."
2,"Interesting concept, poorly executed","When I heard the idea of this book, I was very interested. It seemed like something that, while done even half-assedly, would still be very entertaining. I couldn't have been more wrong. The only reason that this book does not receive one star is because of the concept. There is a poorly developed love story and very poorly developed heroes and villains in this book. All in all I would have to recommend Meyer's A War Undone instead of this book."
3,A period piece in its period,"This was a nicely thought out AH. At times, however, the characters seem a bit wooden - though this may be intentional on Conroy's part as an attempt to portray the times (someone said he was trying to match books of the time, along with just setting the action then).Unlike the many WWII-ish ""Germany Invades the U.S."" stories, this one is actually believable, at least, from a technical plausibity standpoint. Germany isn't trying to conquer the place, just force some concessions. It's small navy can handle the U.S.'s even smaller one (split up in two oceans), and the fact that most of the U.S. Army is away in those newly held colonies makes the invasion's possibility much more believable. Heck, Germany really did have plans for such an invasion, should the need arise.Definitely worth a read."
2,Just doesn't feel like it's 1901.,"I read this because it was on someone's list of favorite Alternative History stories. However, people didn't talk like that then. Read some novels written around 1900 or some of TR's letters and the lack of historic flavor will be evident. Also the lack of patriotism is not credible. I doubt the state of New Jersey would fail to assist New York & Conn if they were indeed invaded. -- just one example."
1,Silly plot.,"Because he's upset that the United States won't give Germany the Philippine Islands, the Kaiser decides to invade Long Island. The plan is that German forces will land and stay in the US until we agree to give the Philippines to Germany or the Kaiser's face turns blue, whichever happens first. Why wouldn't the Germans just invade the Philippines to begin with? Might as well imagine the Confederacy trying to win the Civil War by occupying India until the British agree to help the CSA."
3,Interesting for Alternate History Fans,"One can tell that Alternate History has become a craze when something as obscure as 1901 comes out. I give Conroy credit for taking a totally implausible alternate thread and making it seem like something that could have happened. He portrays an unprepared turn of the 20th century United States struggling to dislodge a crack German army that has invaded New York and Connecticut. Although not Nazis, these Germans are not very nice people and one wonders where a sequel would take their nation (the ending gives a strong hint). Unfortunately, the novel has a romantic side which is cloying and simply awful. Nevertheless, 1901 is a good read for alternate history afficianados which is why I gave it three stars. Anybody else who reads this book will wonder how it ever got published."
5,Great book,The whole premise for the story is a bit far fetched but the rest of the story and the believability of the scenario as it unfolds more than makes up for it.
4,Great start for a new author,"Picked this book up on a whim, and was very supprised. While some might not like the premise (Germany invading the US in 1901), it isn't that far out.Good characters, decent plot, and overall a good read"
3,Sparse but somewhat entertaining.,An enjoyable read. Did not evoke particularly strong emotion. Historical detail seemed a bit off. Cultural anachronisms abound. A nifty concept overall if somewhat mediocre in execution.
2,Starts good and than it trails off...,"Unfortunately, although it starts on a good note, with intriguing international premises, the book gets pretty quickly under ""nobody can beat US because we are US"" spell. So, instead of really exploring the possibilities and alternate scenarios, the book spins towards the only ending author could have imagined - US will win no matter what or how. Author would do well to read ""The Two Georges"" to see how to write an objective alternate history novel, or perhaps ""The Man in a High Castle"""
1,Absolute crap.,"It has been years since I read, or rather started to read, this book. I cannot remember details or specific reasons, I just remember being annoyed with this book. I remember absolutely hating it. I LOVE the alternate history genre, but don't buy books by Conroy because of my memory of this one. I remember seeing one in the bargain bin (not this book, another of his) and immediately put it out of my mind. That's the strength of my feeling re this book."
4,Better than some other Conroy,"Mr. Conroy is an either/or author, His books are either very good, sort of 2nd rate Turtledove, or they are, well, not so good, reading more like Flint.This one is the first type. The basis for the German invasion is sound, considering the mental state of der Kaiser and the need for the German navy to create worldwide ports of their own to support an attempt to build a navy the equal of the British. And in 1901 the US military, both army and navy, did not appear the equal of anybody on the other side of the Atlantic. Certainly not in the eyes of those people who were actually on the other side.Other reviews have explained the actual storyline well, I'll simply add that the world of alternate history is made up of very many common stones and very few real gems. 1901 is a gem."
3,Candy For The History Buffs,"Alternative history has always intrigued history buffs and 1901 presents one of the most illogical premises imaginable; a German invasion of the U.S.A. in 1901. That's what makes this book so interesting.There are certainly historical flaws in the book and some ""leaps of faith"" that make the highly improbable largely possible. But the whole idea of some highly unlikely event taking place is more believable to those who are aware of some ""highly unlikely"" events that have occurred throughout history.This book is enjoyable if not taken too seriously. It's short, fun to read and thought provoking. Just some after-dinner chocolate.John E. NevolaAuthor of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II"
4,Very inchanting and discriptive work for this period.,This book is outstanding in it's entirety! A must read for history buffs!--Dennis Mosley
1,Hate Filled Garbage.,"Yet another anti-German hate novel.Just what we need!Anyone who has the slightest knowledge of history knows that the plot of this book is totally ludicrous.The assertion that in 1901 the German navy was the second largest in the world is a joke,in fact it was no more than 4th or 5th at the best.The author of this book obviously knows nothing about history and probably did no reaserch of any kind.Why are books like this written?Do we really need more anti-German hate propaganda? NO."
4,Interesting alternate history novel with a few twists,"Newly imperial America is too much of a threat for the Germans, and, having declined a German request to sell its newly acquired, formerly Spanish, possessions, is faced with a German invasion initiated over a lazy summer weekend in 1901 . . .Perhaps not the most detailed alternate history, but still stuffed with historical characters both on the German and American sides. Conroy sketches his characters with obvious delight (his portraits of Teddy Roosevelt and ex-rebel James Longstreet are memorable). Since Conroy sometimes gives us background on a historical character, and sometimes does not, a knowledge of history wouldn't hurt in reading this novel. Still, the plot does tend to drag in the middle, though it perks up a bit towards the end with the major battle scene (in of all places. Connecticut).In the model of Turtledove's ""The Guns of the South"", though not as good. Still, it is well worth reading.Recommended."
3,OK but not great,"Conroy represents an interesting concept here but with a horrible storyline, cookie cutter characters, and horrible writing. It was entertaining but I wouldn't reccomend it if your looking for a great book."
3,Too implausible to take seriously,"There are all kinds of alternative histories out there, ranging from wacky yarns involving time travelers and aliens to serious academic discourses. This book is more along the lines of the latter and it's well done and highly readable in most respects. The problem I have with it is it's just too hard to imagine the basic premise ever occurring. In other words, Conroy never convinces me that Germany would have ever invaded the U.S. I give him a lot of credit for trying, however."
2,High hopes...,"...for this book (I thought the premise was fascinating, and involved a time period/scenario that's received too little attention in the alt-history genre) were quickly dashed as I started trying to read it...Mr. Conroy's research is no doubt accurate, and it's a truly great idea for a book, but the writing itself is just, well, horrid. I hate saying that, but it's true. It's a shame he didn't enlist the help of someone with a writing background to co-author this with him. It could have been an interesting read if it was readable."
3,Wow! An alternate history that _isn't_ WWII or the Civil War,"This was a nicely thought out AH. At times, however, the characters seem a bit wooden - thoughthis may be intentional on Conroy's part as an attempt to portray the times. Unlike the manyWWII-ish ""Germany Invades the U.S."" stories, this one is actually believable. Germany isn'ttrying to conquer the place, just force some concessions. It's small navy can handle the U.S.'s evensmaller one (split up in two oceans), and the fact that most of the U.S. Army is away in thosenewly held colonies makes the invasion's possibility much more believable. Definitely worth aread."
3,An interesting idea but not fully developed.,"This was my first Conroy and comparing 1901, his first novel, with one of Turtledove's may be unfair and premature. That being said, 1901 wasn't the page turner I was hoping for."
4,Turning an Unearthed Imperial German Document Into a Great Story,"Fabulous what-if tale based on receltly discovered German plans for invading the US to negotiate seizure of its newly-won territories. Teddy Roosevelt's personality & politics figures in, along with American sentiments common in 1900, Kaiser Wilhelm accurately presented as an overbearing, greedy King with centuries-obsolete views on royal power; in one case, he orders the execution of captured Germans that immigrated to AMerica before the war started.Germany invades a woefully unready US at Long Island and quickly takes Brooklyn. America refuses to negotiate and attacks along Germany's weak point-- thye length of its supply line. American engenuity & technical innotation, including newly-important Navy figure in the filan conclusion."
5,This is THE book!,"I might be biased because I think everything Rago touches is genius but you just can't beat this art pottery expert. This man knows his stuff in a way no one else at this time can touch. His extensive auction and appraisal experience give him light on a subject that is still quite murky. Most of the examples in the book are from his collection or auctions so the reader gets a vicarious view of these masterpieces through Rago.This is the one book to own if you love art pottery. I have spent years waiting and wanting a book like this. Apart from Kovels (written years ago), you cannot come close to this book. Miller's Treasure or Not Art Pottery is also excellent but Rago pours his all into this one. The photos are outstanding-they make you drool. Nearly all notable potters are represented. This is a great book for the expert and novice collector.Get it now...it'll be relevent for decades!"
3,one of the last worthwhile early phase albums...,"Buy this TD album for one reason: Thru Metamorphic Rocks. This track is one of the last hurrahs of their early period and is without doubt one of the most impressive and driving pieces of music I have ever heard. The remainder of this album is the early stages of their future transport into the world of Mannheim Steamroller elevator-fluff. If I were grading this album by the last track solely, it would be 5 stars. Then again, with the current downward spiral of the music industry as a whole, one excellent track amongst 2 mediocre ones is better than reason enough to buy an album..."
5,One of the best TD albums,This album certainly at least ties with my favorite TD albums of all time. In fact it's one of my favorite albums of all time by anyone - period. It's amazing to take on a road trip - or for a rainy night. If you have the slightest interest in this kind of music or in Tangerine Dream at all I HIGHLY recommended this album. And it is timeless sounding - going beyond merely standing the test of time.
2,Bad compositions,"After Tangerine Dream stopped making records that would be called ""ambient"" these days, they're output quality fell down. The group members cannot compose very well and production has nothing interesting. The potentials of analog synths are not used. Bore, bore!"
2,NOT the Virgin original pictured; it's a CEMA knock-off.,"Caveat emptor, potential buyers. The record Amazon ships you is not the Virgin Records original they show in the photo. It's a CEMA Special Products knock-off with mocked-up art. It's nice to have Force Majeure anyway--a prog rock milestone, and WAY spacy--but $14.50 (with shipping and handling) is a lot to pay for what is essentially a Columbia House reprint with fake album art. Star Rating: Virgin Records original : 4 stars The version you get here: 2 stars"
5,FORCE MAJEURE - SIMPLY BRILLIANT,"The rules for listening to this CD are simple...wait till' it's dark, switch off all the lights, find somewhere comfy to lay down, shut your eyes and listen to this through a 'decent' pair of headphones...and let this album 'travel' you to the stars!"
5,Opera memories,To be able to view these Opera stars from the past again is exciting. The vedio is good quality. The sound is equally good mono quality.It will take you back if you are a senior. Younger folk will enjoy too.
3,A reasonably good read,"This book is a reasonably good read, it covers the mani aspects and I did enjoy certain parts of it. I felt it could have gone into more details at other points."
2,Short-lived - it's the pits!,"Just like the others who bought this pitter - I got mine and at first, it was wonderful. Then the 3rd time I used it the plunger fell out and now falls out with every cherry I pit. Piece of junk."
1,not much use,"This arrived after cherry season (my fault for ordering late), but I tried it on various olives. Useless. If it mangles cherries the way it mangles olives, I can't imagine it being useful for anything but a small paperweight."
2,Not much good as an olive pitter.,The design doesn't cut the flesh cleanly. I end up with smashed pieces and large portions still stuck to the pit.
2,Cherry pitter is the pits,I bought this and paid good money for it thinking that it would last forever. First the arm kept coming out and then the bottom holder completely broke off. I was very disappointed with this pitter.
4,Works great,"I have owned this item for about five years and have only used it to pit cherries because I don't like olives. My husband likes fresh cherries, and because I like him, I take out the seeds for him. It takes out the stone about 95 percent of the time, and I've had no trouble with it falling apart. Mine came with a plastic bracket to hold it together when not in use. Of course it goes in the dishwasher. Amazon is running it for a great price at $5.99 with super saver shipping; I paid about $12 for mine, so this is a good deal.September 12, 2011 update: This pitter has held up fine over time; it gets used a lot in cherry season and is still in first rate condition."
1,Total Junk- Falls Apart,"I was pitting my seventh cherry when this piece of junk fell apart. The plunger loosens and falls out, and you can no longer use it. Do not buy this."
1,The total pits!,"My cherry pitter lasted longer than the previous reviewers. The plunger, however, did fall out. The design of this product is obviously flawed."
1,TERRIBLE,"This is a TERRIBLE cherry pitter. I paid WAY too much money for it at an upscale kitchen gadget shop but thought that I would make the investment terrible mistake. The plunger has fallen out and comes out with each cherry. I have tried to glue, and fix and nothing works. It really is a poorly made piece of junk."
4,We aim to please; your aim would help.,"This is a very convenient cherry pitter. It does a nice clean job with little waste. However, sometimes it misses the pit and just makes a hole in the cherry. Whether that's user error or not isn't for me to say but, let's face it, it isn't exactly astrophysics."
4,Great Short Stories,"This book is six short stories. The first story describes how he was underneath his raised floor home (crawling in the sand) trying to poison termites. The description includes the smell of the termite juice mixed with termite droppings that will more than likely run down your arm. Having had this very experience myself it was nice to see it chronicled. He had to have lived in an older home in Coconut Grove of Kailua. The stories are of Hawaii but specifically Oahu, and many set on the Windward side. Living on the Windward side of Oahu, I almost feel as I know some of these characters. Great front Photo too."
4,Amazing Textures.,"Some people have said that they do not like the vocals on this album. To those, I can see where you're coming from...but it creates a completely different atmosphere!I Lied is a terrific example of this. The song is completely full of subtlety and feeling. The choruses are flowing, dark, soulful. The vocals might sound like R&B; at first, but this is just another music source that Telefon Tel Aviv are drawing from.What It Is Without The Hand That Wields It is another example of the completely creative genius that goes on in this album. The beginning, with low-fi piano samples and other ""skipping"" effects, is mind-blowing.While this album might be, on the surface, less technically complex than Fahrenheit Fair Enough, the mood that it creates is unmatched."
3,R&B+D&B=ICM,"In their complete element, TTA feel like some of the up-and-coming master producers in the glitch electronic movement, but all the elements rarely become spectacularly compiled like the best tracks showcase. Instead the small majority provides sleek, if slightly contrived, overly produced R&B+D&B, though it almost always equals intelligent club music."
2,Weak,"This album is filled with pretense. I spin the first record constantly but this one is a piece of junk. One can only hope they abandon the cheesy vocals and equally cheesy beats and melodies (my week beats your year). I feel like these guys are just trying to be funny and make fun of music. I can say there are about 2 minutes of this disc that I like, but by in large this is a HUGE letdown from the debut record and I'll be selling mine for cheap. I also saw them at SXSW this year and the live band stunk. There was no enthusiasm and it seemed like they would have done better to do a DJ type set and lose the lame drumming."
2,let down,i never expected the vocals. they seem unnecessary. ordinary. i never expected to fall out of love so easily.
5,The greatest baby book ever!,"This book is fabulous. I wish it was still in print. If you ever find it, do not hesitate to purchase it! There is space to record everything and terrific prompts for filling in milestones and other information."
5,the Irish Volunteer,I am a historical reenactor and thought this was a great CD. I turned all my friends onto it alot of whom dont reenact and they loved it. I cant wait for a second CD.
5,Great CD,This is a great CD for the Civil war buff. Several songs I have not heard before. Great listning CD
5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!","This CD was given to my husband as a Christmas gift (by my mother) and I just can't get him to stop playing it! It's filled with unique and wonderful songs and the music seems authentic and is great to listen to. The liner notes are extensive and excellent, and we were surprised to find a song dedicated to my husband's namesake, Lt. Col. James Haggerty (maybe a relative?). You don't need a strong interest in the Civil War to appreciate this CD, just a love of traditional Celtic music. Don't pass this one by!"
5,Awesome,"I am a Civil War re-enactor and have several Civil War era soundtracks. This is one of the best. The production values, quality of recording and liner notes exceed other Civil War albums."
5,Brings reality to the Irish/American involvement in the CW,"In all my years of Genealogy research, this is the first album that I have found that represents both the positive and negitive thoughts of those Irish volunteers of the Civil War. It is by-far the best representation of Irish sentiment that I have found to date. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who has Irish roots in America."
3,The Irish Volunteer,"Interesting recording combining Irish band and sound with Civil War music, the popular ballads sung by the Irish Immigrant Volunteers. After escaping one of the potato famines by immigrating, the Irish found themselves in a lethal battle for survival in the War Machine. Well, researched and I'm sure beautifully played, however, it is not exactly my taste in sound and music. The fault is mine."
4,Great but just leave some things alone ZTT!,"I really like this album. I was excited to get all the remixes.... But ZTT decided to mix them all together into one remix for warriors, one remix for whatever. I don't want a 20 minute remix of assorted mixes! Just frustrating. Like redoing the Propaganda album Secret Wish which was perfect, but they had to change it! Less is more kids! Makes me hesitant to buy others!"
3,This video has several good tips for swimming freestyle,"I swim laps on a very regular basis and have completed several Ironman triathlons. Since I don't have a coach, I sometimes buy videos like this to help keep my technique clean. This instructional video has several good tips for swimming freestyle, and some people will probably benefit from it. However, I didn't find it nearly as helpful as ""Fishlike Freestyle"", which I liked much more. I found ""Fishlike Freestyle"" useful enough that I have watched it about five time over the past few years. I watched the video in this review one time and I might not bother watching it again. If you are making an either-or choice, I suggest Fishlike Freestyle. If you have money to spend on more than one freestyle video, then you might consider buying this one too. The cost is lower than the cost of one private lesson with a coach. If you can make even one improvement to your technique, then the video is worth the cost."
2,Wanted more details,"As a new swimmer, i was hoping to get more detailed instruction, but it is mostly just Karlyn swimming up and down the pool with some commentary to go along with that. Maybe I'll watch it few more time and can pick something up from the DVD, but my first impression is that this DVD was not for me."
1,"dexter and crew drunk ""after hours"" maybe ???","Having collected listened and throughly enjoyed quite a number of CD's done byDexter I went ahead and bought this cd on a whim and was ABSOLUTLEY disappointedThe whole set sounded like the players were out of tune and no one played as if they they had a clue as to what they were playing, It surely wasnt jazz music and it sounded very uninspired"
4,I like it,"I like garden of life products a lot , but I will not re order because it is on the expensive side for such a small size"
5,"Great product, Love it !","This product is what they say it is, and I like it.But I understand that it will be no longer sold and anotherGarden of life product will take it's place. But in the meantime I think Amazom.com still has this product in stock."
5,"Great writing and execution, plausible the way the story is set up.",The actors are perfect in their respective roles. Great chemistry and the continuing stories are cohesive. Andersen and his constant dry humor are what keeps this series going.
5,stargate sg- 1 season 5,"This season its one of the best of this them good tv show.Its the one that Daniel Jackson acended to a higer plain of existence.I like all the episodes in this season. I have al the seasons that are on dvd,there is no greater tv show that this one"
4,Solid Season,"The 5th Season of Stargate was a solid, strong, team oriented season. When I watched it first on Showtime, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed but as I watched them again in repeats and then syndication, I found it to be a very well thought out season as a whole and find myself looking forward to the episodes in repeats on Sci-Fi."
3,Interesting...,"Another good effort, but with a little less success.The move away from exploration and towards X-files-like conspiracies and a plethora of blowing stuff up makes little sense in the established universe of the Stargate folks. The first half of the season was good; a little bit preachy, but still with the characters doing their thing.""Wormhole Extreme"", the 100th episode, purported to be a tribute to the show, is a mess of in-jokes and has a serious lack of the actual characters, instead focusing on comic alien Marty and his parody of the SG-1 team. Things pretty much go downhill from there, to the point where original character Daniel Jackson is ""killed off"" in a very obvious scifi-never-kills-anyone kind of way. (Don't worry, he returns in season 7)Some good stories, a couple great ones, and several real duds. Jonathan Glassner--why did you leave?!"
5,Stargate was not on Fox.,"The poster who said that Stargate moved from Sci-Fi to Fox is incorrect. Stargate SG-1 was on Showtime for the first 5 seasons. Year-old reruns play in syndication, which is a different local channel in each city (including Fox in some places, but can also be found on CBS, UPN, etc.) Seasons 6 through 8 are on the Sci-Fi Channel, which took over first-run rights from Showtime. I'm not sure why we should ""be grateful"" to get episodes on DVD two years after the UK... but I'm buying season 5 anyway, because Stargate SG-1 is the best show on television!P.S. To the guy above - Season 8 starts in Summer 2004 on the Sci-Fi Channel."
2,Over-Blown,"A remake of the original silent classic (so much so that the famous chariot race is stolen from the original almost shot for shot), the Charlton Heston ""Ben-Hur"" is so overblown that you may feel the need of an Alka-Seltzer at intermission."
4,good toy. 6.5 to 7 inches tall,well as i read all the reviews here while shopping for this toy I couldn't find a review that stated how tall the toy is. The toy is 6 and a half to 7 inches tall. I dont have the toy with me anymore as i gave it away as a gift so i can't give the exact height of the toy. anyway the toy is very detailed and it looks very nice and kool. its good for collection or for a kid to play with it.
1,the worse captain america ever...!!!,"face off series 1 captain america is the best of all captain america figures out there, but the ultimate captain america series 8 is a joke..!!! face sculp is terrible looks like popeye..!!! in my opinion I prefer the classic captain america and if you really like a true captain america i will recomment you guys to get the face off series captain america vs. red skull... also they have the variant unmasked face off steve rogers captain america witch if an aweson figure too...!!! but this guy from series 8 it isn't an ultimate captain america he's an ultimate popeye...!!!"
2,What a dissapointment,I thought after I got the New Captain America that it would beat my old captain America by leaps and bounds. Boy was I wrong. This figure is not as posable. His face looks more Like US agents than Caps and Hes just all in all and Okay figure. if your a fan of captain America And you want an awesome figure get the series 1 Captain America from marvel legends if you can't get him you could settle for this. but the Series 1 captain America is 1000 times better than this figure
2,Light? What light?,"This camera doesn't understand what light is. No matter what setting I have it on, it is always dark. The videos come out so dark that I have to tilt my computer screen down to see it from an angle.The pictures themselves are grainy and look sandy. I have tried every mode and size and they are still grainy. I had a 3MP camera that took less grainy pictures than this one!The pictures are also very dark. If you are not practically in your subject's lap, then it will be grainy and dark. It seems pointless to have a camera that doesn't take pictures!After having it about a year, it suddenly stopped working. It won't start, turn on, nothing. It is completely dead.I am not sure if my issues with this camera are universal or if I have a lemon. Regardless, I am not going to purchase another camera from Sanyo and I am hesitant to purchase any electronics from them."
1,does NOT work with HP SERVERS!!!,"After my server crashing several times for power issues and speakingdirectly to APC, they state SPECIFICALLY DO NOT USE WITH HP SEVERS, WILLNOT WORK and they are correct, it does not work"
2,"APC ""Selector"" advice was poor","Bought this product along w/ matching auxiliary battery pack BR24BP based on APC's Selector - an online app which asks about your equipment then recommends the products you should consider. The Selector gave me bad advice for my MacPro. I was never able to completely ascertain what the mismatch was about, but threads I found suggested it was either ""inrush current"" where a waking computer's current needs spike momentarily OR something to do with this APC unit not producing a ""sine wave output."" In any event, any time the APS unit was needed to step in due to an electrical outage, the waking of my sleeping Mac immediately overloaded the BR1500 and everything crashed. I returned this unit and replaced it with APC's Smart-UPS 1500 and have never had another issue. Bottom line: APC's Selector needs an overhaul. The two stars aren't meant to say the BR1500 is necessarily a bad product, but rather that its suitability to task was NOT what the Selector said it was."
3,It was good for an indoor fireworks show...,"I purchased this item based on past experience and reputation. However, I definitely got a lemon this time around. After connecting the battery, I plugged it in. I then pushed the power button. As it was going through it's self test, sparks and smoke started pouring out the front! I unplugged it right away, but of course that didn't stop the fireworks show, as the battery was still connected. And of course the battery cover was directly below where the sparks were shooting out of. I got the battery unplugged and opened a window, as the whole room smelled like there was an electrical fire. I have to believe this was due to something getting jarred loose in shipping. Amazon gets 0 stars for shipping out a sensitive electronic device in it's original packaging, with no extra padding. I am sure the UPS guys were nice to it in transit :) At least their returns process is painless. I am going to buy another one locally."
3,Ah,I have no idea when I purchased this book so I'm going to give this an okay approval rating. I hope you fellers enjoy it.
2,This edition does not include his other works.,"This book is not by ""Constance Garnett"".It is a famous classic novella by the great Ivan Turgenev.Be aware that this photocopied edition- complete with tacky cover design - is somewhat inferior to other editions."
3,too melancholic..but beautiful,"Before reading this novel, I have expected something really bittersweet and warm from its title...however, was kinda depressed by its dark mood and the melancholic air covering the entire story. Neverthless....however melancholic it is, it is never too heavy, but beautifully sad. Turgenev have catched that naive feeling of teenage and the infatuation of first love."
1,I picked this up on accident.,"I gave it a quick look over, it's a weak case for Jesus, when it is even mentioning him. If you want positive evidence for the existence of Yeshua Ben Yosef, I suggest you get something else, or just do a search on the net, the information will be much better than what is contained within this book. Even if you're looking for just general apologetics, I strongly suggest getting another book, one without pictures each chapter.This book is crap, plain and simple. The only thing I can recommend it for is to make Christians look stupid. Anyone could read it, and write a rebuttal in a single day.Is it any wonder why I am the first to review it?"
5,HAUNTING,"Although I usually find the inclusion of dialogue on a soundtrack to be intrusive, that's not the case here. Luckily it is not too overdone. The compositions by Trevor Jones and the sax of Courtney Pine bring back all the haunting beauty and terror of the film. There are no throwaway screeching scare tracks. At under 40 minutes, it is a beautiful rendering of a sinister mood that can be listened to again and again. More than a decade later, one might say the film doesn't keep it's ""mystery"" very well hidden but the music has held up. It's a superior example of a composer's ability to make a good film great and for that reason, I can watch it again and again. Note however, I could not watch the film without its score but I can spin the disc constantly. Alan Parker was a genius for choosing to go with atmosphere rather than musical hysterics. Never have the blues been so unnervingly hypnotic."
2,Angel Heart soundtrack,Unfortunately this was a dissappointment in that it did not contain all the music from the movie and sounded as though it was put together by an amateur because you could hear the actual movie in the background. Definately not worth the money that was paid for it and it was not accurately described in the listing.
4,Excellent Reference,"Long ago and far away, I majored in English--and I wish I'd had this book!If your kid is struggling with a course in literature, this is an excellent book to have on hand. It's easy to read and easy to understand.Mine is tattered from 8 years of kids writing papers in prep school English, and also from my own meanderings through its pages.It not only defines a literary term (such as 'comedy of manners,'or 'Proustian')it provides examples from literature (including extensive quotes from time to time) to complete the explanation. When there is disagreement or ambiguity about a term, the text contains both points of view.I found that it was of tremendous use when the kids were studying (the especially hated) poetry, or had to write what amounted to lit crit.I'd buy this again, no doubt about it."
3,Good but not Great,"This book would be a good resource for people starting out in an English program, or even advanced High School students but for more seasoned students in graduate programs, a heftier book is necessary, especially if you are working with theorists like Foucault, Lacan, Freud, etc. If you are using them, go with the Cambridge Literary Theory dictionary. It has many more references."
2,Crucial terms inexplicably missing,"I am a first year PhD student in comparative literature and I was hoping that this book would illuminate some of the often obscure terms used in my field of study. However, the two times I consulted the book trying to find a concise definition of a rather common term (the first one being simulacrum and the second one being metaphysics), I was disappointed by absence. There is a definition of ""metaphysical,"" but it only refers to a British literary movement, and not to the term used in philosophy. I am sorry to be the first reviewer to give this dictionary less than three stars, but a so-called dictionary of literary theory that doesn't contain terms that aren't exactly uncommon in the field deserves no more."
3,Not as good as Bedford or Oxford,"As an AP Lit teacher, I have a few of these types of reference texts on my shelf at work. Experience has taught me that the definitions in Penguin's dictionary are sometimes misleading or incomplete. Bedford and Oxford both provide a more precise definitions. Penguin is really only good for a general idea.Instead of this text, I recommend either:Bedford Glossary of Critical and Literary TermsorThe Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms"
5,the Quest,"this is one of the best books I have ever read(and I've read alot of books). It has action, an interesting search, and even a little romance. The history in it is very well written, and before you know it, you're learning something!! A book I would want if I were stranded somewhere."
4,Does what its suppose to,screwed it in my doorway and it makes a great chin up bar but nothing special
5,Perfect fit for my car...no sqeal so far,"I didn't believe the ""Does this product fit your car"" part of the website, as I have purchased wipers before, and the compatibility guide on Amazon was wrong. Anyway, the pads fit perfectly my car Audi A4 (B6) and so far do not make any annoying sounds...Stopping power is better than on my OE rear pads, but this is only the 3rd day of driving on them."
1,The Sussex Vampire/The Last Vampyre,"I adore Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes and cannot help but admire how beautiful and authentic these adaptations were filmed. Authentic detail and great casts made this a do-not-miss series. However, this episode (The Last Vampyre) is a travesty of the original story. Instead of a moving story about a woman who is protecting her child and trying to keep peace within her home, we have this horrible (as in ""horror"") and mindless tale. No doubt about it. Conan Doyle was a fabulous story teller. Why present this mediocre, at best, plot instead of the real thing??? And the Eligible Bachelor (based on The Noble Bachelor) is nearly as bad. A shame, too. Both original stories were strong and impressive on their own."
2,"It's not the story, it's the woe Brett has been subjected to","I adore Jeremy Brett's skills as an actor. However, ten years after the fantastic Granada series debued, Brett was a remarkably ill man. He was in the midst of a nervous breakdown after the death of his wife, and it is obvious in his face during the mosntrous two hours. I care not a wick for the story, I simply could not tear my eyes off of Brett's stricken and woebegone face. He looked so tired, so utterly tired of the role he has played for a decade. It was indeed cruel to have him come back into this role at that point in his life. He is so talented, so brilliant in his works of the past. I cannot stress that enough. Watch this movie and tell me he is not a suffering man! God rest his soul, we all miss this actor of unmistakeable calibur. I shall miss you, Mr. Brett."
2,Worst of the Brett/Holmes Stories on Granada,"This is by far the worst of the Brett/Holmes series on DVD. Please do not even think of buying the DVD - it's a waste of your money. Far more importantly, it's a waste of your time, and finally, I would not like you to put so much junk into your mind.I thought: ""Well, how bad can it be - after all, there's Jeremy Brett and the wonderful reputation of the Granada TV series."" Well, I was wrong - this one is out and out bad - horrendous story (Doyle's story was quite decent), bad direction and not much scope for good acting. I think Doyle's estate should sue the producers for putting out this piece of bad work in Doyle's name."
1,Put a Stake Through It,"Waxy, bloated and speaking in a nasal murmur, Jeremy Brett looks far more like a ""vampyre"" (to use this episode's overly cute spelling) than he does like Sherlock Holmes in this episode from this series' declining years. Conan Doyle's story wasn't much to begin with (his series declined, too) but at least it had some logic; this video version adds Roy Marsden as a suspected vampire and then has a devil of a time working him logically into the story. It would be maddening if it weren't so stupifyingly boring."
3,Wackos and weirdos and dingbats and dodos,"This album came out after Johnny Cash was dropped by his longtime label Columbia Records, but before he made his ""comeback"" with American Recordings. In many ways, these are the ""forgotten"" years of Johnny's career. Boom Chicka Boom has a sound that harkens back to his Sun Records recordings, somewhat, but it's not nearly as good as those classic records. It's merely an ""okay"" album, without any songs that I would call ""great"". Cash's original songs are somewhat cornier than usual, and while there are some cover songs here that you would think would work out well for Johnny, something is missing. Elvis Costello's ""Hidden Shame"" is a song that could have been a great one for Johnny, but it didn't come out as well as it could have. For some reason, Johnny just doesn't sound as ""inspired"" as he did on the later American Recordings. This album will be of interest to Cash's hardcore fans only."
4,"Nice boots, difficult to get over some shoes.","My husband wanted these to wear over his shoes, since he sometimes goes to muddy areas to visit in his job. He wanted something he could get off easily when he entered people's homes--people not known to him, not friends. Didn't feel he could do that easily so we had to return them. Company we purchased from credited our account in a very timely manner. Quick delivery as well. The product just didn't work for him."
1,very poor packaging of product,"The Isotoner boots themselves were fine, but a hard box shoved inside a soft shipping envelope does not make for pretty gift giving. The packaage was crushed beyond belief and to believe I paid around $7-8 shipping. I will never use that seller again!"
1,total waste of money,hated these. no support for my arches or heels at all. save your money. I guess maybe it is a bonus how small they are so they will fit in small shoes. But i need real support and these just didnt do anything. I found them uncomfortable too. Dont recommend them.
1,Not worth it!,"The insoles started to fall apart after a few weeks. On top of that, it hardly did anything for my plantar fasciitis. Do not buy, it is a waste of money!"
1,very poor quality,"one has a very thick gel support and the other a very thin gel support, obviously a manufacturing defect and a bad buy. If you have crack problems on the bottom of your feet, I recommend Easy Spirit Comfort 2 sneakers, which are really great, if a little pricy at $69.96"
5,A Surprise Tragedy,"When Hattie's mentally challenged uncle Adam, who she never knew existed, comes back from his closed down school, she sees so much more in the world than ever before. Hattie now realizes that her nana and papa aren't the most perfect happiest rich people. She sees people living in her own boarding house lying to her parents. Most importantly she finds those you truly think are happy always hide something inside. This is how it is with Adam and when no one but Hattie starts to realize this something major may happen that Hattie doesn't know about until it happens.I feel bad for Adam because no one can comprehend how he feels and what its like. When Hattie starts to understand a little she can feel some of his pain. I believe Hattie appreciates the summer she spent with her uncle Adam. I feel this way because it opened her eyes and let her see the world in a new way. Adam made Hattie appreciate and love the world far more than she ever did before."
5,Forever imbedded in my memory,This book holds a very special place in my heart. It should hold a special place in yours once you are done reading it. The characters were so well rounded that I did not want the book to end. I highly recommend this book. It is so touching and well written. I continue to think about this book and it has been weeks since I have read it. That is a true sign of a classic piece of writing! Absolutely touching to the heart and to the soul!
3,Irresponsible,"It is irresponsible for the author and the publisher to not mention the mature content of the ending in every description of the book. My daughter has read other books by Martin and when I read the synopsis it seemed to be very much in a similar vein. Her other books have dealt with the emotional loss of loved ones and social concerns of tweens. My daughter, who is an avid reader, was shocked the by the suicide--as was I! An inconceivable omission of information!"
5,Not For 9 Year Olds,"The recommended reading age is 9 - 12 but I'd start at 12 with this one for its sexual references. They were few and far between but if you don't want to start that conversation with your kid, don't invite this book into your home. Other than that, the book was an excellent read. The characters were all well developed and became life-like. The plot was very realistic and related a very touchy subject with perfection. Ann M. Martin should be commended on her ability to weave a dynamic web of a 12-year old coming of age, a 21 mentally challenged person coming to grips with society and inner awkwardness of a family trying to do what's right in both instances."
1,A corner of the Universe,"A Corner of the Universe is about a 12-year-old girl who lives with her parents.She has an uncle named Adam, who nobody, family or friend, has seen in over 3-years. Then suddenly, Adam appears out of nowhere. His school is being remolded. He ends up falling in love with a woman and stays with Hattie's grand parents.I didn't really like this book. I thought it was BORING!!!!!! Who would want to read about a 12-year-old girl and her uncle? Not me!!! My total grade for this book would be a total of 1.5 stars."
4,Amazing read,"This book is a great realistic fiction story. It's about a girl who likes to stay home and be with her friends and family. Her name is Hattie. She doesn't have many friends her age but, she lives in a boarding house and loves to spend time with the older people there. One day she finds out that she has an uncle she never knew about. Her uncle,Adam, is not a regular person. He is suffering from some mental problems. He has been away at a special school for almost his whole life. In this book Hattie finds her way through life and figures out who she really is."
5,A Corner of the Universe,"I love this book! A Corner of the Universe really digs deep into the lives of mentally disabled people like Adam. Adam and Hattie's friendship was a tight bond, and I was sad that it had to be broken through the incident on the top of the ferris wheel and the death of Adam. This is the kind of book that could make you laugh as well as cry, and has a moral to it. Yong as well as old will enjoy this book."
2,Parents BEWARE!!,"This book is INAPPROPRIATE for the ages suggested (9-12). It was presented to my 9 1/2 daughter's library reading group by the school librarian. This book is appealing to children of this age because is is a recounting of a twelve year old girl's summer, BUT don't be fooled! The content contains material that is questionable for this age group. Middle school ages would be better suited to this. Do not judge a book by its medal!"
5,The Best Book Ever!,"This book is amazing. It is all about a girl named Hattie. She lives in a boarding house of which her parents own. One day she finds out she has another uncle who has autism. She spends the summer with her uncle, Adam. Many things happen thoughout the book to do with Adam. You would like this book if you like sad endings.I LOVE THIS BOOK!"
5,A moving portrayal of the life of a small-town girl,"Hattie Owen is a pre-teen before she discovers the existence of an odd uncle, Adam, who is returning to her grandparents' home after his special home/school is closed. Adam suffers from a mental illness which affects his behavior but doesn't mask his intelligence. Hattie's experiences during a summer with her new uncle and the new carnival in town, which brings unexpected friendships to a shy young girl, culminate in an unexpected tragedy. A Corner Of The Universe is hard to put down and a moving portrayal of the life of a small-town girl with close family ties comes to life under Martin's experienced pen."
4,A Touching Story,"Ann M. Martin crafts a simple yet complex story of an eleven year old girl named Hattie Owen and her mentally challenged uncle, Adam Mercer. Hattie's innocence is charming. I enjoyed this book; I laughed, I cried, I gasped, I smiled. I would recommend this book to others, as I know they would appreciate it also."
1,Poorly Written,"This book was very sparse. It was more of a list of thoughts and notes than a book. The book provided no real value, other than to provide a few settings and copnfigurations I could have learned from the SAP site."
1,Useless Book,I m not sure why amzon is selling this book but its really worthless. I wish if amazon stop selling such books to save there repo and image in the market. I purchased this book keeping in mind that amzon is selling it so it will be good and i blindly trusted on amazon. So if amzon want to keep there image intact then I very strongly recommend that amzon should stop sale of this book
5,get what you pay for,this book is worthwhile if you dont have the time to gather information from 1000 different sources. helped me get a grip on what i need to know about SAP security
5,A visual and spiritual treat!,"I like to keep this book by my bedside and open it at random right before I go to sleep. I read the quote and look at the image, as my last thought of the day. I find the imagery powerful and empowering, and the quotes are insightful. This is not just a book for women, it is something that my husband also appreciates. This makes a great gift for special friends, and it is especially nice as a Mother's Day present."
1,"Very unscholarly, for the lay person","This book disappointed me because I thought I was buying a work describing modern practices and devotions to the Great Goddess, or at least modern mythology. Instead it is a collection of pics and facing pages of short, page length essays or poems or ditties. This isn't a deep book and is not academic or scholarly. A lay person wanting to find modern 'prayers' to the Goddess may enjoy this little book that could easily be read in 45 minutes."
4,Felon,"Great look, cool design amazing on my leather belt.. For the hardcore Biker in you!!This buckle will have a amazing look on peoples!!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST CD'S YOU WILL EVER GET!!!!,"Andrew Bird is a FANTASTIC musician!!!! This CD has the best blend of the best music...Hot Jazz, Calypso, Klezmer, Folk, Blues, etc....If you like music, get this CD! If you have heard of the word music before, get this CD! If you are still alive, get this CD! If you don't have this CD...get off the beer buzz!!!! ANDREW BIRD IS COMING OUT WITH A NEW ALBUM AROUND SPRING!!!! (Get that too.)"
2,What in the hell happened to Andrew Bird?,"ThrillsI loved Andrew Bird and the Mysterious Production of Eggs and was expecting the same quality from Thrills. While the music stayed true to the times of early century 1900s, the life seemed to be drained from it. I felt like I was constantly waiting for a song to begin and the next song would start instead. So, I would rate the competence of the music is acceptable but uninspired, especially if you have heard other Andrew Bird productions. This just does not measure up. Unthrilled in the SFBay Area. Sincerely, Tim McCanna"
5,Great album!,"This is one of my favorite CD's ever! The energy that is put into Bird's violin playing astounds me. There is a feeling of folk music in Bird's style, that is blended with the old-stlye jazz sound that is just incredible. I only hope to find more music from Andrew Bird, and I don't think I could ever get enough of it."
4,Good stuff,Good stuff in a sort of Tom Waites- or Juggernaut Jug Band variety- an good addition to your music library. Try it
5,The Only President,"(This pertains just to Volume I) We have had three Presidents who conducted a major war: Lincoln, Wilson, and Franklin Roosevelt. Wilson had John J. Pershing; Roosevelt had George C. Marshall. Lincoln had none; his greatest prospect was Robert E. Lee. So the very title of this book conveys a task for Lincoln that had to be done, if the Union were to survive. And so, Professor Williams starts out telling us in no uncertain terms that the beginning of the war showed no generals likely to be able to do the job . . . he completes Volume One with McClellan--who is not the general Lincoln wants. And we are anxious for subsequent volume(s) for Professor Williams takes us to Sam Grant--the general Lincoln finally found. This book moves along, and as it does, we fairly ache with the disappointment Lincoln suffered time and time again."
3,Lowepro camera strap,This strap is okay not exactly what I expected. I have similar older straps that are more elastic and therefore more comfortable than this one. The memory card storage is a handy feature that I Iike but like other reviews I read you can't buckle the attachment straps back on themselves. So If you use the camera without the neck strap like you mIght want to do for tripod work then the attachment straps are constnatly gettng In the way even to he extent of poking you in the eye. I think there are better starps than this one I'm satisfied but I would not buy again hope this review was helpful.
4,rliu,"I love it for its soft yet strong material and its plain black color without any shouting brand name. It can be unsnapped to make it shorter quickly to use on a tripod. However, the catching mechanism is design in such a way that you cannot reconnect the shortened version for hand carrying. Most other camera straps allow you to do that."
2,Too Afriad to Use It,"It's a nice strap and more comfortable than the standard Canon straps. But, I'm too afraid that I'll accidentally or the strap will accidentally disconnect itself and drop my camera. There's no locking mechanism to keep it securely locked. So, this strap will sit in a drawer forever. Normally, I love LowePro products, but if you like your camera and lenses, don't buy this strap."
3,Almost lost my camera three times,"Like all Lowepro products, the workmanship on this strap is irreprochable, but... the ladder buckles do NOT fasten securely. I've had the strap for a couple of years, but it hasn't been used the way I'd intended - I had hoped it would be long enough for a cross-chest sling, and it isn't - so it hasn't had much wear and tear put on it. But three times - twice in the past couple of months -I've had to make heroic catches when the left side of the strap slipped out of the camera - the whole thing went plunging toward the floor. Not testing my luck any more!!I'm looking for a new strap, one that's much longer, and one that attaches more securely. I'll keep this one for use on something less fragile."
1,DON'T BUY!!,I think you would be very sad about wasting your money on this thing. It doesn't work! You need wire spokes too. I had to change wheels.
3,Its a joke,It might be fun for little kids but if i got it it would be for fun. I would recomend this to anyone who wants to try to be cool but instead get made fun of.
2,HARD ASSEMBLY,"I Just purchased these "" Spinners"" I Have a Mongoose Ace Bike and i dont know who the heck to get them on well at least i have 2 bikes i may be able to put it on the other but if not i will be Very Sad : ("
2,One thumb down,"This DVD is very heavily cut. The prologue and Act I take 30 minutes. The entire ballet takes about 1:20. This video represents and abridged performance and should be labeled as such. Further, Ms Tennant does not dance well. Strictly for Nureyev fans."
5,Original Golden Crest Masters,"Wailers - Wailers - Everywhere! Mid to Late 1960's, growing up in Tacoma and Fircrst WA - The Tacoma Armory - Spanaway Lake Dance Hall - Evergreen Ballroom (long-live the Ballroom!) - The Spanish Castle! The Wailers were (and are!) THE MOST INFLUENTIAL GROUP EVER ON NORTHWEST ROCK! I went to Junior High, High School and College (yes COLLEGE!) with several of the band members and those were GOOD TIMES! Pre-New Age rock? They pre-dated them all! And they are STILL packing them in!"
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"An ""alternate miss world"" video with host Divine. Divine isn't funny and the competition has no talent. Divine fans beware!"
5,no unseen eposides!,"I totally love Miracles, although they shouldn't advertise there are seven unseen shows. I just recieved mine expecting them and I had seen all 13 of them. So I was disappointed in nothing new.R.Polen"
3,Miracles,"There is a reason this series didn't make it. But...it was not because of the actors. Even though little known, they worked hard at a bad set of scripts. This is a poor knock off of the X Files. A tortured male lead, a female partner, she gets about 6 lines a show (but of course is a knock out), and a boss who speaks a least 10 languages(not exagerating). They investigate a lot of very ordinary cases. The lead always gets beat up and falls for someone he meets on the case and the boss has lot of cut aways where he is looking Oh so serious. A priest/friend is his conscience, but he's not even sure he believes in God and here is a waste of great talent. There are 13 shows. Show 1 is a 4, shows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,13 are 2 to 3, and the last 3 shows seem to get up to speed at about a 3 to 4."
5,INTELLGENT AND REFRESHING,I never seen the series on regular tv. I wasnt a regular viewer of the X FILES which many compare it too due to the unbelievable nature of its subject matter. . But i like the stories tackled in MIRACLES. i found myself getting through this dvd set very quckly as i wanted to move on from one incredible story to the next. I like the cast and the theme which is well described in product overview. This was a short lived series which I AM VERY GLAD i found . It was better than a movie and i got to enjoy several Miraculous hours of MIRACLES. You should too. The series will touch some emotions to be sure. This one stays in my personal collection so i can share it with my family.
5,Best. Show. Ever.,"I rarely get hooked on network shows, but I was hooked on this one. And when it was cancelled, it confirmed my view that the networks are run by idiots!Eerie, beautiful, haunting, thought-provoking, spiritual, horrifying, intriguing --- well, I'm running out of adjectives.Thanks heavens SOMEONE had some sense and released it on DVD."
4,"Great fun, great rhythms, great atmosphere,really accessible","Toure Kunda were one of the first African outfits I ever saw and this album pretty much captures the magic of their live performances in the mid 80s. You can listen, you can sing along with those beautiful African voices, you can groove to the melting pot rhythms and if you just put it on in the background it will keep the atmosphere smiling and lively.There's rootsier music out there, and fellow Senegalese Youssou N'Dour is both funkier and more intense, but if you're looking to branch into Africa, check this album out. You won't be disappointed. Four stars rather than five because it's not quite sublime, but it's not far off."
3,Pretty good -- could be better,"Although this book does a fairly good job to cover the ground with Personalization & Membership (P&M), there's still a lot left unanswered. I found that it is more useful as reference material than actually learning how to program for P&M.Much of the book is filled with extraneous content, especially if you're an ASP programmer. It would be nice if someone would write a book specifically focused on programming in ASP for P&M as well as explain things a little better than ""This is what you type to get it to do this"".Until there's something better out there... you're probably going to have to be satisfied with this."
2,Beware of sample code!,"While this book is a necessary companion to the Site Server online help, I have been badly burned by using the sample code. There is one example of creating a class in Chapter 14 that was obviously dashed off without being tested even once. These utilities could have been very useful. Instead I ended up wasting a lot of time.Use the Site Server SDK instead."
3,"Does the job, but that's about it","This book is certainly the best available (currently - Feb 1999) on Site Server, and is invaluable for that reason and that reason alone.However it is fairly dry, the code has plenty of errors in it, and while it occasionally roams into other topics (e.g. building C++ components to let site server run personalised media streams) it neglects several more core topics which I would really have liked to get to grips with, for example building and using a site hierarchy in conjunction with membership server."
4,"If you want to understand PM Server, get this.","Site Server is a large and complicated product. The documentation that comes with it is unclear. For someone who wants to master the most powerful and useful part of Site Server, Membership and Personalization, this book is a must read. It explains the technology in terms of how its used in the real world. While I don't usually like ""how to"" books, this one is an exception."
5,Excellent overview of Site server membership server,Excellent book for understanding how site server works and how to use site server effectively for scalable application. Deals with issues like using LDAP for authentication in a simple language and clears some fog behind the memebership and personalization
2,nothing is really helpful in this book,"no special examples, no step by step setup tutorials, just talking in general sense."
1,Too much USELESS information.,"This was one of the first book on the topic, so there was no choice but to buy it. However, the author does not get in details about all of the setting to get the SS3 up and running, even though he dedicates 2 chapters to setting up Site Server. Most of the information is just a lot of technical jargon and no meat. If you are interested in Site Server, you will be better off waiting for another book."
2,Hard to get through,"Bought this for my daughter as it was required summer reading. She had to push hard to get through it, and she read me a few chapters so I could understand why it was so laborious. Just not our kind of book I guess - the story line and characters failed to capture, and the author's style didn't resonate."
2,Not appropriate for some teens!,"I was reading this book and previewing it to see if it would work for my 10th grade world history classes. Though, I am not a prude and understand that literature can be subject to interpretation, I must agree with some of the other reviewers here on the inappropriateness of some parts of this book. I was looking for a good YA book on the middle ages, and was a bit thrown off by the several really unnecessary sexual references in the book. I understand that for the book to be accurate or semi-accurate for the middle ages and the crusades it is not going to be a Disney story and there is going to be some blood and gore as it was a violent time period. But it was the several sexual references that turned me against this book."
4,EXCELLENTE!,a very great book. It really describes the middle ages perfectly great. The description made are very clear so that you can imagine as if you are there.
2,Accurate But Overly Gross,"Was looking for young adult books to supplement our homeschool study of the Middle Ages. This one looked promising, but it finally grossed me out too much. I wearied of all the descriptions of bodily functions, bug infested armpits, and squishing lice off their own skins. Not to mention the graphic descriptions of rotted bodies, etc. If you don't mind reading these things over and over, this may be the book for you. We passed on it."
2,Book of the Lion?,"Bleh. Add bawdiness to ""..stink and bugs, random cruelty, drunkenness, and sudden death..."" and you've almost got it. The story started out so good, but it got worse the more it went on. Frustrating. And the title had nothing to do with the story (unless I missed something)."
3,The Book of the Lion review,"I disliked The Book of the Lion because of the boring rising action. Michael Cadnum does a good job of giving details but in some parts of the book he tells the story in a boring and slow way.In The Book of the Lion an apprentice named Edmund was awaken at night by the Exchequer's men. They were sent from the king to punish his master for making counterfeit coins. This part of the book got me absorbed into the story, but as I read more throughout the book I started to get more and more bored of the story. Michael Cadnum is a good writer because of the details he gives but he should make The Book of the Lion's story go a little faster.This book has a good story and has a lot of details. Readers must be able to stick to a long and somewhat boring rising action in order for them to actually like the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the subject."
2,very scholarly,"this book covers an incredibly interesting and important topic - however, does so in a style that's very difficult to follow, in particular if you're new to what the author writes about. unfortunately, dr. condron lost me almost immediately and didn't seem to make a huge effort to be understood by a beginner like me. i hope to find books on the topic that are written in plain english as the bits and pieces that i did get were very relevant and eye-opening. if you're a beginner like me, then you might find this book too scholarly. this is not a book for someone looking for kundalini yoga exercises!"
5,I love the concept of creative genius and chakra energy.,"Though I have had many creative experiences in my life, it had not occured to me that these were related to the chakras and their use. Now that I know this I have been able to stimulate creativity within myself at my command. I love this book. There is much more yet to learn and I am loving every minute of it. Thank you Dr. Barbara Condron for giving me the information I need to be aware of my own creative nature"
1,very unimpressed,"This book presents a ramble about the author's thoughts and previous thoughts/teaching regarding Kundalini. It is filled with scientific errors, ungrounded assumptions and vapid generalizations. I found no real knowledge, insight and certainly no inspiration within its covers. Most of the book is not about kundalini at all but about the authors opinions and understanding of different subjects. I found those quite unremarkable."
4,Review/Truffaut/Jules et Jim,"I love this film. Sure, the sexual prowess and primordial impetus behind, well, seemingly everything was enjoyable: the images were sexy. And that is all one could ask from sex appeal in my opinion. But whatever. The real girth of this film is in its politics. It brings compromise down to the community level. Nationalism, commitment to a common man even at the sake of losing a great friend, is no match for Truffaut's ethic. I think his is the braver of the two. Bravo."
3,Jules and Jim (1962) - Francois Truffaut,"Jules and Jim is an imprenetrably emotional film full of superficial characters and a plot that never stops to take a breath, but this could possibly be everything erratic director Francois Truffaut intended. Despite some pleasent performances, nice cinematography, inventive editing and camera movement, the film just never comes together. It's incredibly fast moving story unfolds in such a jerky fashion it's hardly enjoyable. The film can be seen as either a reality based love triangle, or a fairy tale, but either way you look at it, it doesn't work. It's the type of film you see because of it's reputation, and sparse innovation, other than that, Jules and Jim is an irregular mess that's easily forgettable."
2,Very very thin.,The theme is the femme fatale: a highly neurotic woman who can never be happy and who keeps seducing men to gain power over them. This theme does not emerge until late in the movie and it does not redeem it. The men who fall for the woman are contemptibly stupid and J. Morreau is not THAT beautiful. There was also no indication why the woman is so neurotic. A marginal movie.
5,It's All Over Between Us,"I've loved this film, and most of Truffaut's others, since it first appeared: the lyrical style, the beautiful photography - so perfect for that timeless time in Paris - Werner's extraordinary performance, the background music, just about everything in it. There are some longeurs near the end, but then the final two scenes arrive with stunning effect. However, when I saw it last, it finally hit me after all thse years: I just can't stand Catherine anymore. It still deserves its *****, but Catherine and I won't be seeing one another again.By the way, the one star reviews of this film are worth reading for laughs."
3,A haunting magical movie,"I'm not normally a big fan of ""Art House"" movies, but this one is an exception. Telling the tale of two men of different backgrounds who first meet and become fast freinds in 1907 era Paris, and later become involved with an enigmatic woman, it holds your interest as you follow their lives from the carefree days of the early 20th century up through World War one, and into the 1920's where one final act by the woman alters the lives of all three. When I first viewed the movie many years ago, I really didn't pay too much attention to some of the symbolism in it, so it was a pleasure to be able to rediscover it. In one example, we see Cathrine circa 1908 leap off a bridge into the Seine river in order to shock her two male companions. This forshadows her final act; when she drives a car off the end of the same bridge, now bombed out from the war killing herself and one of the male leads. It is images such as these that help to make the film memorable."
1,An Utter Bore,"Five minutes in to this movie, I knew that Jeanne Moreau was going to destroy both of the title characters. Then, about six hours later, she finally did it. Why this movie has such a great reputation completely escapes me. It just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Very boring, and very precious, in that annoying French New Wave film kind of way, which means that a bad script and bad performances are the hallmark of quality. A surprising botch from the usually great Truffaut. To see Truffaut's best work, see The 400 Blows, or The Last Metro. Avoid this one like the plague."
1,this is what hell looks like on video,"worst movie ever made...if you want to waste money, then burn it but don't torture yourself by watching this sewage."
5,Five stars,"The stories in this collection are gems that every mother can relate to. If you're a mother or a daughter this book is a must read! The stories will make you laugh and cry and, best of all, you'll recognize yourself in many of the pages. Debbie Farmer, parenting author of 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat'"
4,Inspiring Journey,"I read this book about ten years ago and still have vivid scenes in my head of Mr.Meegan's couragous undertaking. I was so inspired by his determination and daring I set off on my own adventure. At the age of 62 I walked across England alone. It wasn't as dangerous as Mr. Meegan's oddyssey, but it was a milestone in my life. Read Longest Walk and it will inspire you to more adventurous undertakings or just give you delightful hours of armchair travel as you walk in his worn-out shoes."
3,It can bleach your clothes,"Overall the Tide product is good. But, be careful when working with delicates or colored fabrics. I ruined a tee shirt because the tide stick took out the color of the fabric as well as the chocolate I was trying to remove."
4,Mostly works well,"I really, really wanted this to work great, since I am both a klutz who spills stuff on herself and a mom. So far I've used it on:1. Tomato sauce - works perfectly if you catch it right away, so-so after the stain has started to set (5-10 minutes)2. Chocolate icing - lightened the stain, but was still clearly there.3. Baby spit-up - totally gone, but that's an easy one.4. Soda - worked perfectly5. Red food coloring - smaller dots totally gone, larger dot got smeared and became a nice big light pink spot, instead of a dark red medium spot :) but food coloring's always badI'm pretty happy with this, it works very well as long as you get to the stain immediately (meaning you notice it when you spill it!) and I will keep one in my purse and one in the diaper bag."
4,saved my butt,"Had an interview in an hour and got a pizza stain, panicked, went to 3 different dry cleaners in the city, and none would do an emergency cleaning. Went to the pharmacy and bought the Tide to go. Totally saved my Butt. Everyone should carry one of these in their briefcase/car/whatever. It removed a red marinara like stain from the pizza, I applied it about 30 minutes after the stain, and it worked. Even though it didn't remove it 100%, it got most of it and faded the stain to the poitn where it was difficult to see, which is what counted at that time. Just make sure you use it right (push-blot, then rub/mark out)"
1,Ruined new pants--on the very first use!,"I purchased a six-pack from amazon, and used one on brand new Billabong board shorts within minutes of lightly dropping a dab of pizza filling. My initial test of the tide-to-go stick worked alright... within several hours, I looked again and noticed that some color had faded out where the tide was applied! I read the stick precautions and saw no warnings with regards to color loss. Always test on a hidden location beforehand and all of that, but I am extremely disappointed. What is in this thing, bleach? No warnings on the stick to speak of!I am never buying another Tide product."
4,I have been using it over three years,I work at a restaurant and this is a must have item! There are certain food stains this product cannot erase(such as grease or chili oils) but other than that I have had so many little spots cleaned out through Tide to go! One will last at least a month or two!
5,Good stuff,"I carry one of the Tide pens in my purse all the time. When one of my kids drops something on their clothes it takes me about 10 seconds to get it out. It doesn't work as well on really greasy stains, but pretty much everything else comes out without issue. In the past if I was in a public place and one of my kids dropped something on their clothes I had to go to a public bathroom and get my kid all wet. Half the time the stain did not come out. With the Tide pen I just pull it out of my purse and any smallish stain can be taken care of in only a few seconds. No mess at all--makes going places with kids lots easier!"
3,50% Active,"First of all i thought that this product is a one of a kind, but i change my mind when i use it.it can clean easy stain but it can not remove strong stain like some suase and chocolate cake.i will recommend to buy this product but don`t expect that it will do magic."
4,Good Instant Stain Remover,"The Tide to Go Instant Stain Remover is pretty handy when you have an emergency situation on your clothing. It works great on Pen stains, not so much on the greasy, food oil type stains. Best is to use the laundry detergent right away, but in tight situations an Instant Stain Remover sometimes keeps the stain from sticking or clinging to your clothing.Removes: Soda, Ink, Coffee, Milk, Ice Cream and Orange Juice so far..DOES NOT Removes: Any HIGH OIL TYPES like, Curry, Salad Dressing (sometimes), Chicken Stew etc.. Mainly, it will take out the stains but still lives a slight mark on the clothing.."
2,Effective Coffee Stain Spreader,"This morning I spilled coffee on my ""million dollar"" white dress shirt. It left me with three large coffer stains. I remembered that I had my Tide To Go in the car. After drenching the stains with the solution and rubbing them per the directions, most of the coffee stains had disappeared....what remained, however, were large coffee colored rings at the edges of where the solution had spread. So, most of the coffee stain was gone, but I'm left with the unsightly rings...not quite as noticeable, but there're still there."
1,Miraculously Unuseful,"I've had a tide stick at my office for 6 months. The three times I've used the stick, after a salad dressing spill, coffee stain, and mustard stain, the stick has gotten rid of the stains, but leaves a white stain instead. In some of these cases the white stains are more salient than the original stains."
1,Garbage,"I figured I would give these a try since the Oxyclean stain sticks I bought did nothing. These did nothing either. We are only talking about dried blood on light cotton too. Nothing too drastic. In fact, one would expect with cold water and a little stain remover the stains would come right out. Didn't do anything. In fact, after watching it do nothing to remove the stain, these sticks actually made the stain more resistant to simple soap and water. Don't waste your money."
4,Its good,"It is not one of the stain removers , which instantly gets rid of the stain.So when you spill over something over your t-shirt, you got to spill this TIDE STAIN REMOVER on it as well so it does make sure that your cloth wouldnt be clogged with STAIN but its not an immedieate relief solution."
3,Sometimes useful,"When these do work right, they work great. But they don't often work right. And additional things are usually needed. I generally will not use this alone. The solution seems good at preventing stains from setting in. So I usually will apply this and then blot with a damp paper towel. The damp paper towel will help remove the stain and the solution does seem to help prevent it from becoming permanent once washed later. That said, without blotting it with a damp towel, it will often leave a stain of it's own. I gave it 3 stars because while it does help in some way, it doesn't help in the way it's advertised to. And it certainly does not work in the way the commercials make it seem to. They stain will not just disappear with application."
4,Mission accomplished.,"Though I've loved bands similar to these guys for ever, I only recently got this album. Mainly because I remember having the poster of the cover when I was in high school. Now that I've absorbed ""Carved In Sand"" I like it quite a bit. I won't make band comparisons, but they are good at goth/pop influenced rock. A nice mix of rockers and mellow tracks. I tend to enjoy the first half more, as it includes the good opener ""Amelia"", the beautiful ""Butterfly On A Wheel"", and the most rocking song ""Deliverance"". ""Sea Of Love"" is good too. The rest is still decent, and I like the final song ""Lovely"" as well. I believe one of the guys was a member of Sisters Of Mercy at one time, and I can hear that even if in a subtle way. I've heard and believe that this is one of their best."
2,Got it for a class,"This book was pretty boring. It displays an interesting point of view of slavery that wasn't just picking cotton. However, there's only so much you can say before the stories start to seem the same."
4,sonic psychedelia from the dawn of time,"This gets classified as ""world music"" in most places, but BREATHE is an attempt to synthesize most of the musics of old aboriginal cultures and dig up the common root of human music. What results is a compelling, hypnotic force that reminds you of many ""primitive"" musics but isn't exactly like any of them. This is music for dreaming, meditating, altering your consciousness thru sound, time travel and astral projection, and the suspension of reality. Simple power, powerful simplicity. Drums and chants and drones and exotic things that will transport you if you let them."
1,Too repetitive,"What a disappointment. The first three songs are exactly the same as well as one of the last songs. How many times do we want to hear men grunt? What, no women in creation??? I kept picturing the Maori hoisting a boat out to sea. I didn't like it and am disappointed. Was hoping to use it for my yoga class but it is too loud with the drums and too silly with those grunts."
1,Too repetitive and unsettling.,"I was completely disappointed in this CD, especially after all the good reviews others have given it. This CD is overly repetitive and uninspired for me. It will be a dust collector for sure!"
5,Earth-Shaking Paradigm Shift from a Very Prominent Biologist,"Ruth Hubbard is a professor emerita of biology at Harvard and a member of the Council for Responsible Genetics, a prominent national bioethics board. In this book (co-written with her son-in-law, Elijah Wald), she takes everything you think you know about genes, genetic health care screening, DNA fingerprinting, the Human Genome Project, and the search for a gay gene and other behavior-related genes, and blows your mind by explaining, point by point, exactly how unreliable, meaningless, and discriminatory each of these much-lauded technologies is. After reading this book, you'll never read a newspaper article about the latest genetic study the same way again. Don't miss it."
2,"The work of a good scientist, an abysmal social commentator","Hubbard does deserve credit for throwing some skepticism on ""the next big thing"" in science, genetic technology. Unfortunately, she combines her skeptical analysis with her hopelessly egalitarian political views, obscuring any positive contributions this book could have. Hubbard goes through every expected cliche - Nazi imagery (social pundits never tire of this), playing the ""race card, and discouraging scientific progress as ""unneccessary"". Read this book only if you wish to glimpse the future of awful politically-correct rhetoric."
1,Rhetoric Against a Needed Science,Ruth Hubbard uses the rhetoric of exaggeration to try to convince us to abandon genetic research. But if genes didn't matter then monkeys could talk and if environment didn't matter then we wouldn't have schools. Obviously they BOTH matter.Let us use the objective methods of science to document the specifics of what is genetically determined and what is environmentally determined.Any serious AIDS researcher knows that without genetic research we have no chance of defeating AIDS. Obviously we need to study genetics to maintain progress against disease.
1,does not fit,"The item shipped is not the item pictured and it does not fit a 1998 Hyundai Sonata 2.0L. I returned the item and had another sent, and it did not fit either. Amazon was great and gave me a full refund, but be cautious when purchasing this item."
5,NICE CHANGE OF PACE,"This was a fun movie with a nice surprise musical concert ending! The guys are hot, the story fun, and the moral of the story is right on track! For a light and enjoyable evening that will leave you smiling - this is a great flick!"
2,not worth the watch,this movie sucked poor acting performances on both parts I think too generic feel and it wasn't even funny but you can't too much from a romantic comedy i guess.
2,I guess it's okay for a Lindsay movie...?,"I liked Freaky Friday, but after that, she pulled a Courtney Love and screwed over her whole life.Ashley Albright is a squeaky clean, popular, pretty-in-pink, almost too perfect character.The guy is, well...not very cute, and not very popular. He's actually quite grubby.To say it in the least, I barely got through the first half-hour. (And I was watching it around 5:30, so don't question my credibility.)In one word, *BORING*. I nearly fell asleep. After much struggle, I managed to watch the movie for a whole 45 minutes without throwing a fit over what a waste of money this was.I could have done so much more with 2 bucks in Family Video!I guess if you like boring plotlines, 5 'o clock shadow, and sugary sweet ""nice"" girls, then this movie is for you."
3,A Teenager's Review,"I thought this movie was really cute. It is definitely a chick flick and is very entertaining. If that is what you are looking for, entertainment, then I would recommend this movie, but if you are looking to watch something meaningful then ""Just My Luck"" probably is not your best bet. I would definitely recommend this to any McFly fans. They have more than just a camio role in the film so it is worth seeing if you like them.~Jenna"
3,It was a'right......,"Ashley (Lindsay Lohan) stars as a yuppie who takes life (and her luck) for granted. After meeting loveable loser Jake (Chris Pine), he siphons away her luck with a kiss turning her luck sour. Can Ashley restore her luck to its former greatness or is she destined to be a loser?This was an enjoyable lightweight comedy with unchallenging dialog, pretty people and a few really funny scenes. I enjoyed it, but I got a bit bored during the part where Ashley's luck runs bad. I don't really like watching someone constantly humiliated and embarrassed, even fictionally, and I'm not a huge fan of slapstick so the scenes with the washer and dryer and the blow dryer were 'meh' moments for me. Overall, it was a cute film but nothing ground breaking. 3 stars."
2,Snippet,"The technical aspects of this movie are OK, and of course New York city looks bright and inviting. Success and failure are measured by the size of apartments and the ability to date rich guys or hot (pretty stupid) girls. The film is simply dumb, to the point where you cannot ignore this quality even when watching in zombie mode. Also, it tries to sell a light-pop British boy-band with too much fury. Like a movie from the Disney Channel. What more?, ah, Lindsey Lohan is extremely beautiful, all the time, and the deleted scenes are good and should have been included in the movie. That's it."
3,It's okay,"This movie is okay. But overall, it is not very good. This movie is not all funny. Some of them are actually fair-fetched. For the story, it is only so-so. It is all because these kinds of lucky and unlucky scenarios do happen in real life. However, some cases do not need to be over exaggerating. For the acting, it is a good one because for the role of Ashley, Lindsay Lohan suits as her role. For the direction, well, it is okay overall because the whole movie is just okay. For the visuals, they are so-so. For the music, they are good because almost all the music is from McFly and suits the movie. Finally, for the sound effects, they are okay. So, overall, this movie is okay to see."
3,Funny Movie,Just My Luck details the lives of two people.Ashley Albright has always been a very lucky young person. She gets a promotion and gets the chance to set up a party. At the party her luck changes.Meanwhile Jake Harden has the opposite luck. He just got fired from a job that he does'nt even get paid for. He crashes the party Ashley throws. They kiss and their luck changes-which is where the movie really gets interesting watching spoiled Ashley try to find the person she kissed to change her luck back.What happens-watch just my luck!
4,Soft and comfortable,"I like these even though there probably isn't a size that fits me exactly. This is a perfect item for me if I need to push the trash can out in the morning in the rain, but for just lounging I'd probably opt for socks. For roaming around the house, I would choose flip-flops or snug slippers I don't need hands to use. These really warm up my feet fast and look good too. It's hard to beat this price but the generic footprint (or poor sizing chart?) is what keeps me from giving it 5 stars."
3,warm and cozy,"These are very warm and soft. I almost can't wait until winter. Sadly I had to modify them with elastic because one was missing an elastic cord and toggle, even so they are comfy!"
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!!,"Purchased several pairs in several colors to use as stocking stuffers. They were not at all what I expected. They are just a pair of fluffy socks with a no slip bottom. If your looking for something more substantial, this is not it. The quality was very poor and very disappointing. Needless to say, They were not given as gifts."
1,they didnt even feel good on...,these were ill fitting and very poorly made i guess thats why they were on sale... get what you pay for...
5,****PurrrrrrrFECT!!****,"This ""slippers"" are heavenly! I wear them all the time! I got them for my mom but, they didn't fit her!!! LOL!!! lucky me!!!! they fit great! I love them!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"Sure they are soft and warm, but after giving several as Christmas gifts I was mortified how they fell apart after three days of gentle wear. Cheaply made, soles seperate from bootie and a complete waste of money."
1,Garbage-go buy socks instead,"I bought 2 pairs one for me and one for mom. I got them both in M/L size. I wear a 9 and these are super tight on me. Mom wears a 6 1/2 and they fit her ok, but a little loose. The soles are very cheeply made. You are better off investing in some great slippers from a department store or just some nice soft socks. These aren't very comfortable and garbage."
3,not durable,"These slippers are soft and comfy but there is not much substance to them. The material is thin, and wearing quickly, even with just normal wear around the house. DIsappointed when I took them out of the package because I knew they wouldn't hold up and wouldn't last."
1,Terrible! Do not buy,"These broke right out of the box, they fit horrible and they flop around and are useless, even though 2 pairs only cost me 4.98 , I returned these! I read the iffy reviews and took a chance, oh well you win some and lose some!"
3,Hue Women's Long Muk Luk,"I was a bit disappointed when the slippers arrived. I had ordered a medium which was supposed to fit a size 8, but they were too small. I gave them to a friend who absolutely loves them tho. She says they keep her feet very warm. I didn't get to try them, but do want to comment to be careful to order the next size up due to the fact that they run small."
2,"Women's long muk luk, chinos","I read the reviews before I purchased the Muk luk's. Even though there were quite a few big negative NO's, I ordered them anyway. I must agree with the NO's. The words, ""Too good to be true"" are my warning to others. For the price, I should have known. Great idea, but socks work much better.D.Lee"
1,very bad quality,"It is not a pair of slippers nor a pair of socks. The quality of the cloth is very thin for such a model... When you wear it, you feel like slipping at any moment."
1,disposable slippers,"What a rip off! These cheap and cute slippers were thrown together to make a quick rip off buck. Any decent company would have took the time to make sure they were stitched to last at least a few months of winter! I ordered 6 pair, and 2 pair have fallen apart in the 1st week, with only 2 days of wearing each pair. I will not buy from Amazon ever again, as they know what and who they sell for and are contributing to scam jumk."
3,"""Slipper-socks"" a better name","These are more socks than slippers. In fact, buy a smaller size than you wear, because they will fit your foot like a sack. My feet swim around in the size large (I wear size 8 shoes), and the adjustable feature is little help. It does tighten the strap around your leg, but the ""slipper"" (and I use that term as loosely as the thing fits my foot) still flops around on my foot. The elasticity in the top of the sock, around the calf, is also weak in the size large. The sole of the ""slipper"" is no more than little rubbery dots on a rather thick felt-like pad sewn onto the sock. The product gets three stars for warmth, because it does have that going for it. If you catch these on sale for $6, they might be worth the price for what they are. Much more, and I would recommend buying a nice pair of socks."
5,LOVE THESE!!,"I just got these and ordered a pair for a friend and I totally LOVE them!! I wear an 8 and I got the M/L and they fit pretty snug but perfect. I had socks on with them too. I like to wear socks with my slippers and these are perfect for that. I like that they don't have a hard sole but little rubber things so you don't slip but can still curl up on the couch with out wearing ""shoes""."
5,In Your Face Truth,"I was an atheist for most of my life and when I became a Christianity through examining truths, this is one of the books I picked up to read. I found it to be strikingly true. My life was pointless before I found God, in fact didn't see the point of living on many occasions. God gives up purpose and being German the chapter on the Nazis really affected me. I would recommend reading this if you are not afraid of truth. If so, probably not the right book for you."
1,"Save your money, folks","Just the openning line of the back cover notes, ""Atheism is a world without God. Its true nature-whether disguised in Eastern mysticism or American cynicism-is despair. In this thought-provoking and insightful book, Ravi Zacharias exposes the hopelessness of atheism"" tell you all you need to know. If you are religious, there is no need for this book. it will NEVER help you convert an atheist or practitioner of ""Eastern Mysticism."" I am an atheist, I am not in despair. To the contrary, not believing the myth of an afterlife allows me to live life in the moment and make the most of my time on Earth. For those of you who question whether I worry about what happens after death, I ask Why should I worry? I won't be around. Me being dead and me existing can not happen simultaneously."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"Beware! Despite no mention as such, these are pre-owned clubs. The first set arrived minus three clubs. They shipped with no head covers. Golfsmith re-shipped another used set; promised to ship covers for hybrids later; reduced price by $50. When my replacement set arrived, the Golsmith store price tag still on the clubs was $150 LESS than what they are selling for via Amazon!!! My problem is not with the product, but with the seller... live and learn."
2,Inconsequential,"This is a short and silly CD. It is only 32 minutes long, and there are only two songs of any substance on it. I think the cover gives a good indication of what the music will be like.This is Shriekback's fifth CD. They were a British new wave/alternative band that spun off of Gang of Four and XTC. They play similar music. Only this CD is much lighter.This CD doesn't have any of the haunting or sultry rhythms that made the group popular. This is mostly bouncy, silly ditties. They even try to do KC and the Sunshine Company's disco hit Get Down Tonight, and do a pretty bad job of it.Most of Shriekback CD's are out of print and hard to get. Because of that, they can be expensive. Go Bang is also out of print, but generally cheap and easy to get because nobody would pay big bucks for what amounts to a novely EP."
4,Tiny shank,"This tower is high quality material, nice and heavy and sturdy. The only issue I have is that the shank elbow reduces the 3/16"" line down to 1/8"" or smaller. For me, it caused too much turbulence and created a huge amount of foam. As soon as I replaced it with a one piece shank that is 3/16"" all the way through, the foaming issue is gone. All-in-all a great tower, but for the price, should have come with a better quality shank."
1,THE WORST BOOK EVER!,i had to read this book for my class. It is the worst written book i've ever read. The whole thing dosn't make any sence. i'm a good reader but the way it was written i couldn't understand. i literally fell asleep reading this thing. it is definatley not for 9-12 year olds how in the world would they understand it. even if your older you must have nothing to do to spend time and read this. the only good thing about this book is when your done reading it. ( i don't think it deserves even 1 star)
1,Andrew's Review,I gave this book 1 star because the book was really boring. It almost put me to sleep.The book takes place in Southern Illinois and it is about a boy named Jethro who wants to go to war.The family got tired of hearing about war and during the war people threaten Jethro's family.The book has a little bloodshed in it when they were talking about the war.The book tells what went on during the war when you live on a farm. When you turn the page somtimes it was good but it was mostly boring.I think it was the worst book I have read.There was nothing I liked or great about the book.And there was no point about the book at all.
1,this book is not good,"This is the worste book i've ever read in my life, save youself and don't read it. My life is permenently scared and i'll never be the same again. My friend Marcos tried to comit suiside because the book was so bad."
1,Across Five Aprils - Jay Sheth - Historical Fiction,"Time of this book is during the Civil War when a family called the Crieghtons are going through hard times. They are on the Northern side with Abe Lincoln, so many of the men of the house and family list into the army. However, one family member is on the opposite side and the town is against him while another one dies in the war. After a while the North was able to escape with the victory after the town comes to togther to help the family.The reason I'm reading this book is because it has been picked for me for a group book by Mrs. Shea my english teacher.My favorite part is the whole thing because it is the first book I have read with so many emotions. It makes you want to cry, laugh, smile, and frown. The family's problems and jokes never end. Once one does another one starts all over again. This made me feel like i was watching a TV show. Altough I didn't like the book that I recommend it to people who enjoy history."
1,Don't Even Waste Your Time!,"There isn't much to say about this book. I was assigned to read it in 8th Grade English class, and I assumed that it wouldn't be as bad as it was. We hadn't read many books yet that year so I was sort of excited about reading it and hoped it would be a good book-soon my hopes were shattered.I didn't even finish the 1st chapter and I it was so boring that it seemed to take five Aprils to read. I only finished 4 chapters and I regreted reading each of them."
2,Not the best.,I'm a college student and was doing research on young adult novels. For a runner up to the Newberry it was very dissapointing. It starts out well but then it soon begins to slow down and by the end starts to read like a history book. It is a fact that many young adults drop a book the minute they think they're being taught something. I'm sure this has been put down many times.
3,It was fine.,"As a whole people who are looking for a thrill or a light read shouldn't read this. It's very descriptive and you need to devote your attention and a willing attitude to be able to enjoy it. I'm in 8th grade and thought that it was hard to stay into. Personally I would have rather read something else, but I did get a good sense of life during the civil war and I suppose that's why I was made to read it."
4,Very Good!,"This is an excellent book. I would suggest this book to any other. This step-by-step book tells about the civil war, and the epic tale of a family going through love and hate."
4,give it a chance,"For me, this book wasn't at all bad. In fact, I started it yesterday and today I'm finished. If you want a short little story that will keep you interested, then you should try this one. But that's not all it did; I picked up a lot from what I didn't remember in the Civil War. This book hardly made it an American history lesson--it made the Civil War come alive instead. For the kids, well I can understand your pain. In junior high I wouldn't have given this book a second look, but wait a few more years until you can appreciate the history and writing in it. All right, take care."
1,Can you say BORING!,"I had to read this book for my 8th grade English class and Iwas so bored by it. The language was way too confusing to read. I fellasleep every time I would read it. The plot was ok but they could have made it more interesting. Sorry folks, I hated this book so did my whole class, even my teacher!"
5,Have loved this since I was a child!,"[...] I read this book when I was nine or ten years old, and I understood it perfectly. In fact, despite the many books I have read since, I remembered this title and have often recommended it to others as a great example of American historical fiction. I learned so much about the Civil War by reading it, and thought it beautifully captured the emotional conflict so many felt at the time. I have had a passion for American history, particularly the Civil War Era, ever since.Books like these are great for learning about our past in a more personal way than a dry history book. They help us to understand what generations before have gone through in order to make our country what it is today. [...]"
2,not really my thing,"i didn't really like this book, b/c it didn't have much of a plot. though Hunt had it to some degree, it can get pretty 'sleepy' pretty fast"
2,"Could've been better, much better!","ok I know the civil war was a horrible event in US History but I mean c'mon, need more action and it was just plain boring because every other scene was sad and droning! It was a good book for learning about how life was back in that era!"
2,Across Five Aplrils,This Book was pretty good but when I was reading it it waas not a realy good page turner to me it was kinda boaring but other than that the language and stuff about the civil war. And when he try to get eb out of trouble it was preety good.Andrew Loper
2,Ennui (Look it up @ you will see what I mean!),"The book Across Five Aprils was really hard to get into. I ended up reading the first chapter four times before I even remotely understood it. Perhaps it is because my knowledge of the Civil War is not quite extensive--but how could that be? I have studied the Civil War for countless hours and have read many books on the topic. All I really want to say, I guess, is that if you are going to read this book, it is best to have a good handle on the Civil War and to like to re-read passages. (This was written with all due respect to Ms. Hunt and her novel.)"
2,"infomative, but boring",Hunt tried to cram too much information into 1 book. The story was not destinct enough and was shadowed by stero types and more.
1,It was Ok,"I read this book for school, and I found it excessively boring. While I understood a lot of it, I definitely would not have picked it to read on my own free will."
1,Could a book be any worse?,"By far, this is the worst book I have ever been assigned to read in school. Our whole eighth grade class had to read this book and I don't think there was one person who liked it. I know the adult reviewers of this book seemed to like it more than the school-age reviewers and one went so far as to say that children would like it better when they were older and could understand its beauty better. However, I am not a child that can't understand books. I have read many great works which I know that many adults have never even dared touch (ex. The Catcher in the Rye, The Grapes of Wrath, Uncle Tom's Cabin, The Three Musketeers, The Red Badge of Courage, The adventures of Huckleberry Finn, etc.). I agree with many that this book is so boring that it would put many to sleep. I hated this book so much that when we turned our copies in, I thought that the best use for the stacks of books would either be firewood alternatives or for skeet."
2,"Informative, but boring","While this book was seemingly crammed with information it was also incredibly boring. If you have a Civil War project to work on read it, if not I wouldn't want to read about Jethro and his family's many dull problems"
2,I Survived,"This book was assigned for my 8th grade English Honors course. The book was easy to follow along with, but it was not very exciting. I found the story line to be well organized, but I really wanted to smack around all the characters, especially Jethro. I can't even remember why, I just feel that he could use a smack in the face."
3,Pretty hard reading for a young person's book,"What happened on the home front when all the young men left to go to war.This novel is about a boy growing up in a farming communityin the north bordering a southern state whose relativeson his mother's side were southern.He follows the battles in the war as he struggles to get the crops in.The point that northern people looked down on the farmer's dialect is make.I enjoyed the historical perspective of the novel,but I found the prose hard going at times as a matter of written style."
1,"Slow, Hard to follow","I was assigned to read this book for an English class. At first I thought it wouldn't be too bad, but lo' and behold it had a slow and simple plot. I heard about this author as being awarded and plaudited for her work. Sadly, this book just didn't reach me or my class. I zealously believe that some of the facts about the battles are wrong. I would recommend, however, her other book, ""Up a Road Slowly""."
1,This book put me to sleep!,I had to read this book for English class. It was boring and didn't interest me at all. The only thing that was useful were the facts about the Civil War. It had no physical discription of the characters. If you want to read something interesting don't read this book!
1,Andrew's Review,I gave the book one star because the book was really boring. It almost put me to sleep. The book takes place in Southern Illinois and it's about a boy named Jethro who wants to go to war during the Civil War. The Jethro's family got tired of hearing about the war and people on horses threatened them. There was very little bloodshed about the war and it got really boring as you got farther into the book. I think it was the worst book I have ever read. There was nothing I liked or great about the book. There was no point and that's why I gave it one star.
1,The most boring I ever read.,"I read this book for school and it was so boring I couldn't finish it. Obviously, other reviewers agree that...this book [stinks] Several words in this book were difficult to read and the dialect just got on my nerves. I say...burn the book. If I could give this book zero stars, I would. I don't know how this book got a Newbery Honor Medal. Anything that involves something historical most likely will. If you're going to write a book for an award, write a sentimental, mushy, war story."
1,one messed up book,the book was ok but it was too confusing. the people are saying the weirdest stuff i've ever heard. i would give this book 0 stars but i cant. i dont recommend buying it. it's worthless!
4,Across Five Aprils,"I really enjoyed reading this book to my sons and we have gone through quite a lot of books! It gave a different perspective on the Civil War and what it was like to be in that family shoes, so to speak. I had read it to my children and they enjoyed it, caused a lot discussion. I didn't give much thought to the title or author when I returned the book to the library, till I wanted to recomend to their teachers as a good book to read to the class. I had forgoten the name of the book and the author. I searched the library and on internet trying to locate it with no luck, I had given up and was sick about it. I mention it to my niece who is another avid reader she also enjoyed Across Five Aprils and more importantly remembered the title.This is a book that I have to have for my collection!"
3,Across Five Aprils,Jethro had brothers who fought for two different wars. Jethro was around during the Civil War. He was very sad beause of Abraham Lincoln's death. Jethro is from Illinois and Lincoln was too. Life isn't fair. The author of this book heard stories from her grandfather and that's what influenced her to write this book. The Civil War almost destroyed the whole South.
2,I've read better.,I had to read this book for an 8th gade class. I had a hard time reading the book because the story was so dull. I was a little dissapointed. I was also lost for some of the time. I watched the movie based on the book after I read the book. The movie was horrible. It was an ultra low budget that was worse then the book.
4,This book is amazing in it's storytelling!!!,"This book was so excellent! When you get into it is so sad, with much hate and prejudice, but also with a love that binds the Creightons so they can get through all the tradgedy they suffer. Jethro is so tough in appearence, but underneath he is sad about the losses of his family. He becomes a man way too early and through the book i was sort of worried he wouldnt be able to do it any longer. I will say no more except for this: Anyone that misses out on a book so touching and well thought and told, is missing out on one the great parts of life!"
1,I think this book is WAY boring.,"This book is hard to understand, mostly because of the dialect. Irene Hunt is a good author, but I think she could have done MUCH better."
2,To Bore or Not to Bore.,"If there's one word that describes this book it's BORING! C'mon, Irene could've losened it up a bit and made it barely exciting! There's like twenty charecters you need to keep track of with dumb vocabulary like, ""Them taters better be bedded."" Jeez!"
2,Pretty boring,We read this as a class and I didn't like it at all. Half the time you didn't know what was going on and it was really confusing. There was alot of extra detail that made it even MORE confusing. And nothing really happens- like Jethro is the main character but he just basically sits around the entire time. Nothing exciting ever happens. The characters barely even have personality.
2,Across Five Aprils,"My reason for rating the book Across Five Aprils by Irene Hunt low was because this book had several words that were had to read example:from pages(51-52)""you're too young to be married, Jenny; you're jest a little girl.' Oh. Jeth, it's horrible to be so young. Why does there have to be a war to take Shad away from me before I'm of an age that Pa thinks thinks is old enough fer marryin'?"" Several accounts of the book were true which was good. I did not like how Jethro who was at the age of nine in the beginning was shown as so mature and to me was percepted as a boy of a man's age. At the early parts of the book I recieved an opinion of Lincoln from the book and reasons were not explained for this opinion being formed. I would also recomend not reading this book in a school enviorment,the children do not like this plot in my past experiences. I have seen it used with seventh graders and feel they werent interested in the book's story. thank you -Mimi"
3,Alittle long and boring.Good description,"I think that the book was kind of boring. It had hardly any action.It did have some suspence,when you would wonder who was killed and who wasn't,but there wasn't very much. Although it wasn't very exiting, it was very descriptive and told what the civil war was like for the people who weren't in the war. It was well writen for someone who likes the kind of stuff the book tells."
5,CIVIL WAR TIMES FOR READERS WHO SAVOR EVERY DETAIL.,"Irene Hunt describes life on a southern Illinois farm in much detail. Combine this with a dialect and you have a book not all readers will appreciate. However, some readers will find themselves caring deeply for young Jethro and all he struggles with - the loss of a brother, the responsibility of farm work, the hostility within the community, etc. They will also learn much about the Civil War as it unfolds throughout the story. This is an extremely well written book, truly deserving the Newbery Honor it won."
4,"Not the best Civil War book, but certainly worth reading.","It is a pretty good book, I enjoyed it. Irene Hunt did a great job of telling what happened to families. Jethro was the only kid left after Tom, Eb, and Bill went to war. You always hear alot of families split by the war and brothers fighting against brothers and it's true and this book describes it well. Although The Killer Angels was a better war book this book is definately worth your time reading."
1,This book is a piece of _ _ _ _! It totaly _ _ _ _ _!,This is the stupidest and most boring book I have ever read. I have to read it in 8th grade and it makes no sense. Make sure you never read this book! NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!It STINKS!!!!!!
1,I only give it a 1 star because there is no zero stars,this is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! It had no action let alone anything that could reseamble interesting. The book was plain and simple terrible. Whoever made that book should get an education!
1,Sux,"That book was the worst book ever written, it was REALLY, REALLY boring. I was supposed to read it in 9th grade CP english, but I got to the 3rd or 4th chapter, and said screw it. I would rather make an F, than finish that book. Every one of my classmates hated it. It should be banned from america."
1,Across Five Aprils.,"Across Five Aprils is a horrible read. It is based around a colicky 10-year-old boy named Jethro who lives on a potato farm on southern Illinois during the Civil War. Throughout the book, he whines about how horrible war is and how he wishes his brothers would come home from it. The combination of his constant complaints, his occupation of potato planting, and the fact that the ""big adventure"" is a four hour trip to the town of Newton, make this book about as exciting as watching grass grow.Do not get me wrong, the book has some redeeming qualities. It provides historical information in the form of letters from the brothers at war, and from Jetho's one-room schoolhouse education. The other positive things about the book have, for the moment, escaped me. Nonetheless, they were surpassed by the book's slow movement and the author's poor writing, lack of originality, and conformity with the ""war is bad"" theme in all its political correctness. Thus, my recommendation is to no one."
1,REALY PREDICTABLE,This books is so boring. It is not original at all. Every book is like it so don't read this book. You will just be forcing yourself to read through. SO yes it is very boring.
1,A5A,This book is boring because it only talks about Jethro. I don't like this book. The only part i liked was when there barn was burned down.
3,Brothers at War,"Six brothers who live on a small farm in Southern Illinois durng the Civil War, have a family conflict. Four of the five brothers went to fight for the North and one brother fights for the South. Jethro, the youngest brother, has to stay home with his mother and sister to run the family farm. Everyone at home worries about the brothers at war. Getting letters helps the family know about the war battles. I gave Across Five Aprils a three star rating because it was slow moving in the beginning. If Hunt had added information about war scenes, the story would have been more interesting."
1,"This book was very boring, you should have TIME to read this","This book was the worst book I ever read. You should have A LOT of spare time to read this book, and should really want to read it. This is not a book I recommend for ages 10-15, it should be a book for older people, and have to be interested in the Civil War."
2,Boring as hell,"Reading this book (until chapter six, where the book picks up somewhat), I thought to myself, ""Why does my teacher hate me so? Does he find interest in learning about someone getting a bad headache from lack of coffee (which takes up an entire chapter)?"" This book offers a different look at the Civil War. A boring one. Written 100 years after the Civil War ended (1968), this book set the precedent of ""don't write about the Civil War if you aren't going to talk about battles, because it's boring."" Read something interesting with your ever-disappearing life."
1,A childs Review,I was forced to read this book in nineth grade ela. It was the most boring pointless book that was ever published. It is about a boy named Jethro who is a farmer in the civil war . Jethero ends up joining the army and goes to war..... The end. I wont tell you what happens at the end but this book is written in old english and does not portray childrens thinking well. It is definately a bad book. The story is bad and so is the writing so the only reason we should be reading this book is to know an example of how not to write .
2,bad book,"i honestly cannot tell you much about this book because i didnt finish it. i got up to chapter 3 or 4, then got bored out of my mind. one thing i did like about this book is that they spelled the words as the people pronounced them, like family was fam'ly and happy was 'appy, i think you get the picture. this also made it confusing in some points, where unless you said the word out loud you would not be able to figure out waht it meant. one more good thing was the characters had conflicts not only with other characters, but had internal fights. one of the sons, Bill, was a Northerner like his family, but did not believe in the North so he went against his family and fought for the South. i cant write more because i still need to find cliffnotes for this book-i didnt read it and i need to finish a packet on it ;)"
1,THS BOOK STUNK!,I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP I WAS SUPRISED ANYON GAVE IT A 2! I DIDNT EVEN FINISH IT IT WAS SO BORING!
1,Across Five Bedtimes,"The Stupidest, most slow book I've ever read. I had to for 8th grade, but I don't know why they make us. Everyone in the grade hates the book! PARENTS AND TEACHERS: Please don't make your kids/students suffer through this awful book about some nobody named Jethro. I mean, really, who names their kid Jethro? This book is such a stupid tale about a hillbilly family! PLEASE (for your own sake) DON'T READ THIS AWFUL BOOK!!!!!!"
1,This is the worst book I ever read...,"I hated this story. It was hard to understand, especially for a kid. I only read it because I was forced to by my teacher. I recommend to kids everywhere to NOT read this book. This book was difficult to understand and I hope you never have to read it."
1,very boring book!!!,i had to read across five aprils for the start of 8th grade and it was so boring that i couldnt take it anymore. I dont kno y teachers assign boring books like that. everyone agrees with me and its should be a law Come on NO more boring books please!!!!!
1,Without a doubt the worst book I've ever read.,"I'm only giving this book one star because it will not allow us to choose a zero! The majority of this book is in a language that 95% of the country doesnt understand and the other 5% are actual civil war survivors or have at least convinced themselves that they are. I normally enjoy reading, and often read more than is asked of me or just for my enjoyment. Most books I read are books that are to do with actual events and are written by authors who speak the English language. This book is without a doubt the worst book I've ever been forced to read, and this is the second time I've been forced to read it. I'm not going to bring up faults in today's education system in this review but it is certaintly a cause for concern. I hope to God that this author is not paid for writing this."
2,"The story in this book is meaningful, but boring.","This book is not one of Irene Hunt's greatest novels. Having read the ""Lottery Rose"" first, I thought that this book would have been equally as interesting. The book is set in the period of the Civil War and it is about a family who goes through a trying period because several of the men in the family leave to take part in the War. The main character is a young boy named Jethro Creighton who journeys from boyhood to manhood throughout the course of the book. He has to take on the responsibilities of the older boys when they leave. The community does not back the Creighton family because one of Jethro's brothers joins the Confederacy. This causes problems for the family as a whole. Needless to say, they stand by one another and stick together. The book has a few other little sub-plots, but none that are overly interesting. Sorry people, the book was not on my list of 'most fascinating' books to be read."
3,decent novel about a family split by the Civil War,"This book is a coming of age tale for southern Illinois preteen Jethro, who's hard-working farm family is forced to face the American Civil War. Jethro's schoolteacher, brothers, and cousin (who later deserts) fight for the North while his favorite brother fights for the South. The family must face the horrors of the war from the home front while also facing the prejudices of the zealots of home. The book would be incredibly difficult for young readers because of the dialect. Also, the plot is more tell than show. But, still, a powerful human tale of a border-state family during a tragic period. Grade: B"
3,not for younger readers,"i first tried reading this book when i was 8 or 9 because there was nothing else in the house that i hadnt read. Even then i had a fairly high reading level, and so most books like this were no problem. But this one i just couldn't read. It was moving too slowly in the beging. I tried reading it now at 14, and i found it more interesting and easier to read."
3,a good book,"I think this book is really good. I like the characters espically Jethro because hes determined, shy, and outgoing, he likes to help people. this book has also many other interesting characters, you might like, there are also many different parts there are scary, sad, mad, glad, and cheerful. It teachs you different things about the civalwar and racism. And thats why I like this book."
1,Omg the most boring book ever!,Ok...I'm not going to lie here..This book was down rite awful..It was the worst book i'v ever read! It was very small print and confusing and since i have glasses it didn't make it any better. Please save urself and don't read this book unless u have to!
1,DON'T BOTHER!,This book is so hard to understand! The dialoge is southern! I'm a new yorker! And I have to write a report on this book for 7th grade literature! This is probably one of the hardest books you will ever read! Don't read it unless you absolutley have to!
1,DON'T,Hi i read this book because it was on my summer reading for school. This was the worst book I've ever read in my whole life. If you dont have to read this then dont you will hate it. Everything from the authors wrriting to the plot was horable This was the worst most horable book EVER
1,Zzzzzz,"Sorry folks, but I thought this was a VERY boring book. I did't think it was very exciting and the dialect was beginning to annoy me"
1,"I felt the book was horrible, who wants to read about this.","It was no fun at all, it was to stretched out, at least Hunt could have smashed it all together to make it a bit more exciting, i mean come on."
1,I AM TELLING YOU...................,I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START WITH THIS BOOK. I AM IN THE 7th GRADE AND I HAD TO READ IT FOR SUMMER READING. IT WAS THE MOST CONFUSING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. IF YOU ARE GOING TO READ IT YOU HAVE TO READ IT TWICE. IT WAS SO BORING AND IT MOVED AT A VERY SLOW PACE.I DO HAVE TO SAY I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE.THE CONTENT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND MANY COUNTRY FOLKEN WORDS ARE USED WHICH MAKES IT EVEN HARDER TO UNDERSTAND.MY OPINION WAS WRITTEN IN THE MOST POSTIVE FRAME OF MIND THAT I HAVE. THANK YOU.
1,This book is boring,I didn't like this book at all. It was a long story about a family with problems. You expect action in this book but instead there is a buch of long character building stuff in it and unreasonable twists of fate to make the book somewhat interesting. I f you want civil war action don't read this.
2,It lacked in plot!,I think this book majorly lacked in plot and moved very slowly. I had to read this for English class. The only good thing about it was that it used historical happenings which made it seem realistic rather than fiction.
2,CONFUSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I thought this book was hard to Understand it was written for older people not 8th graders i enjoy social and reading but i did not enjoy this book. I have heard Irene hunt writes better books than this one
2,Not Worth buying,I read this book for eighth grade during the summer. My parents had to force me to read it because I couldn't even comprehend some of the material I wouldn't even recommend this to a person I don't like.
2,no way!,man...books don't get more boring than this...i recommend it only if you have nothing better to do.
2,A slow book.,It was a slow book.I would not recommend it unless you are bored out of your mind.It is the kind of book that makes you go to sleep.But it has a good ending.
2,"Pretty Bad, and too long","I was forced to read a book and I chose this one. Not a great choice. In some parts of this it is very detailed (mostly at the beginning) but on important things like death and love its very limited. Kid's my age (8th grade) should really choose a different book, this is more long, boring, and a replace for a sleeping pill. I gave it two stars . (-<) Peace out :)"
2,not what it's made out to be.,"I have read this book two times. It was very hard to understand the first time. I was in sixth grade. The second was for an 8th grade reading class. I understood it more but it was very boring. I read Irene Hunt's ""Lottery Rose"" in 7th grade for leisure and it was great. I don't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't like the Civil War."
2,It was stupid!!!!,"This book wasn't all that great!! I don't think it should have won all of those awards!!! I had to read this book and do a project on it, and it was really hard because the book was confusing. I don't recommend this book to anyone. If you have to read it, then I feel sorry for you!!!!!"
2,It was kinda boring,"I had to read this for my English class, it was so boring to me that I decided not to even read it! i didn't understand it."
4,A unique opportunity readers to grasp history.,"The Civil War did not occur without frustration and a sense of endless struggle. Young adult readers must be willing to invest those very attributes into the reading of this American classic. It is not an easy read with pretty wrapping. Rather, it asks the reader to live those five historical years and reflect on his or her own development into adulthood."
3,Great - but not relevant for everyone,"First, I think that anyone studying ITIL will benefit from reading this book - There is a lot of valuable information here.However, its not relevant to everyone. It seems focused on medium to larger business that are somewhat out of control. If you're a small or medium sized company that wants to use ITIL, and your current situation is not great but far from chaotic, then there are only a few points that will help you.I also want to say that the review by Mr. Shepard is also quite accurate."
3,FAirly good. Very small book,"Not as detailed as I expected. Many times, the same principles are told over and over again. All about change control. We all know it's important, but implementing is not as easy. REquires more beauracracy in the system to successfully implement it. Other topics such as serv. mgmt, finances, etc., related to IT are not covered. Beware the actual content of the book is only about 40 pages, excluding introduction and appendices. Tiny book. The book is about 7 x 5"". I was very surprised when I received the book. Everyone knows that change control is important. Everything in this revolves around it. Good narrative examples. I bought the foundations of IT serv. mgt and this one to take the exam."
2,Very practical but short,"The book was shorter than I expected, it was actually a pocket book. It wasn't my first reading about ITIL and it was the worst. I have to admit that I don't like the concept and I am more into project management and PMI standards."
3,A Simple Life,"I've read many books by Rosie Thomas and thoroughly enjoyed them - all very different though, but all remarkably well researched. I enjoyed A Simple Life too, but not one of my favourites by her. I found it a little implausible in parts and somewhat predictable. I bought it on the basis of rave reviews by other readers, so was slightly disappointed. However, if you're looking for a good read, which is not too taxing, then this will be good for you. Maybe a good one to put in a suitcase to read on the beach."
4,Fun read,"I first read this book when I was a sophmore in high school. I loved it. It was one of my favorites and I shared it with many friends. I've read through it a few times since and though I'm slightly more skeptical and analytical now I still find it to be a fun read. I think you can identify with many of the things stated in this book and its fun to get familiar with other Sun Sign characterisitcs and try to guess different people you meet. Its a fun little game I like to play now. I recommend this book if you are interested in astrology and sun signs, however I think its important to not take it too seriously and just enjoy it. (***This would probably make a great gift for a teenage girl!)"
5,The Definitive Work,"Quite simply, this is The Bible of astrology. It is the standard by which all others should be measured."
5,An excellent introduction to the mysteries of the stars!,This was the first book I bought on astrology- sixteen years ago- and I haven't found a better book on the subject since. Unfortunately I've lost the book- and all the notes I made in the margins- but was so glad that the book was reprinted- Now I will start all over again!
5,"Thought-provoking, compulsive and uncannily accurate.","An excellent beginners astrology guide to the sun signs. Find out the basic personality of yourhusband/wife, workmate or boss here. Mostof Goodman's comments are likely to be on the mark which must be why this book has been selling so well for so long. Read it with a partneror a friend and start to understand yourselvesbetter."
5,Most excellent read,"I first read ""Sun Signs"" back in the late 70's. At the time i was working in psychiaty and found the book most enlightening in understanding patients and co-workers. This book started out as entertainment but upon further reading and with an open mind (essiential) you find that it definitely provides insight into the pesonalities of loved ones and friends. Others came to the same conclusion once they opened their minds and really read it objectively. Very benificial when meeting new people. Put it right up there with ""Dianetics"". A must read for anyone interested in the human psyche."
4,"QUITE GOOD, ASTONISHING, BUT NOT PERFECT","WHILE READING LINDA GOODMAN'S BOOK, I ONLY DISLIKED TWO THINGS, HER EXCESSIVE COMPLEMENTING OF HER OWN SIGN, ARIES, AND THE FACT THAT HER DESCRIPTIONS OF EACH SIGN WERE NOT QUITE ON TARGET. NONTHELESS, I SUGGEST THAT EVERYONE BUY HER BOOK. IT WAS A GREAT HELP IN MY STUDIES OF ASTROLOGY, AND BROUGHT A LOT OF INSIGHT INTO THE SUBJECT. IT WAS PERSONAL, INTERESTING, AND WELL WRITTEN. EXCELLENT PIECE OF WORK, AND I'M VERY GLAD I OWN A COPY. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY OPINION."
1,Simplistic and stereotypical,"This book gives astrology's critics all the ammunition they need. Simplistic, silly and stereotypical profiles, with no acknowledging the complexity of character and personality. Also, I know the book was written in the 60's but the incredible sexism kept my teeth on edge. Read this book if the only women you know are housewives and ""girl"" secretaries (and find out which ones are out to marry the boss to boot!)"
1,LindaaGoodman Sun Signs,This book was yellowed and falling apart. I wrote tothe distributer but got no response.
5,Great Astrology Book!,"Linda Goodman has always been my go-to person for astrology, and this book is no exception. It's a good companion to her Star Signs which I have."
5,sunsigns,"all her books have been around for many years, they have amazed me and I never get tired reading them over and over another great buy for pennies! I'm the saver of old book and many trees, think green buy a used book. every book I get is like new in perfect shape for these oldies but goodies... hail to amazon's used books....."
3,"Dramatized, expansive portraits of the Sun signs","Contents summary: The Sun interpreted in the twelve signs of the zodiac (528pp). Each sign placement's interpretation is subdivided into six sections, covering its general, male, female, child, employer and employee manifestations.By far the lengthiest Sun sign portraits ever written, dating from 1968 and still unsurpassed quantitatively although arguably superseded qualitatively. Comedic and chatty writing, awash with poetic licence and sometimes seems rose-tinted; a dated style you may love or hate, but the writing itself is selectively very observationally insightful without being heavy on psychology or overly distracted by mythology. Fine for its purpose; inspiring for astrological sceptics and beginners, and worth reading from beginning to end in order to increase familiarity with the Sun signs, though not the last word in understanding them."
3,Not the full version,I have the original mass market paperback or rather one of the many printings. I must say while this gives great information it does not include so much of what my paper back includes. I would really like to see the full version even if its not free. Three stars for this version not the work its self that is five stars all the way.
1,This is all bunk!,"None of this is scientific in any way! Do not recommend buying this at any price! Nothing makes sense, and it's just pandering to confirmation bias."
5,damaged goods,This is a book I have enjoyed for many many years so ordered it for a friend. Imagine my disappointment to find once it arrived the fly leaf was torn. Where was the quality control??????? She graciously accepted it but I felt embarrassed...........I must admit to feeling apprehensive about ordering again.....sincerely Ted Gorrod
4,Very Good,"I don't read my daily horoscope--that's bull. How would anyone know your day just cuz of your sign?However, I was convinced that astrology is for the most part, accurate. Of course--not entirely. I'm sure not every Pisces is creative, not every Virgo is a loner, and not every Capricorn is conservative.Astrology is just a basic generalization that hits most of the targets of a person's personality, according to their sign. I'm an Aquarian, and I can assure you I am not unemotional. Not every trait of your sign has to be true.This is a good book, and like the other reviews say, don't treat it as the FINAL word. It's not. It's just a fairly accurate reference. That's all. Don't take it too seriously."
5,"Linda Goodman's ""Sun Signs""","This is a fantastic book. Not just because of the Author, but due to it being her first major work. Pure original Goodman in hardback."
4,Still a Classic!,"I read this book years ago and loved it. I made it part of my own personal collection this time. The book is still great. For those who believe that the sun and stars have a message for them, check out this book. It has very in depth information. Even for those of us who really don't fully embrace this thing called Astrology, the book is still intriguing and enlightening. You may be suprised and say "" this book has some truths about my personality."" Anyway, it would gender great conversation. It is still a ""Classic"""
2,way oversimplified,the purely Caucasion physical descriptions should be updated. Ignorance shows...maybe ok in 68. As atypical Virgo due to other influences I found it wrong wrong wrong. Use with huge grain of salt. Better yet dont use...read for fun if at all...tho style gets tiresome and grating.
3,Linda Goodman's Sun Signs,The words of Linda Goodman were as always GREAT but this printing was BAD. The paper and binding made it hard to read. I would buy the same book but not this issue.
2,OK book,"This book is really made for someone who's deep in trouble. I think I just have a little ""mall"" problem. This book is more for someone who has bad credit, is trying to avoid or is going thorugh bankruptcy."
1,"Review? Stale, mate","I wasn't expecting much from the chess set, but the plastic pieces were disappointing: they're just checkers with symbols printed on them (e.g., a silhouette of a pawn, of a king, of a queen, etc.). The board is stored folded into four pieces and doesn't stay flat when unfolded.The book is very short and not particularly helpful either."
4,"""Bad Reputation"" is enjoyable and should make you think","No question about it, ""Bad Reputation"" is enjoyable. Thin Lizzy has a terrific sound and there are many great numbers on this record. Actually, I'm particularly impressed with the lyrics on this one; both `Soldier of Fortune' and Southbound' are excellent in that way, as are most of the others. To be killed without a cause is not that unusual either, as far as I'm concerned. The guitars are great and truly Thin Lizzy in flavour.While not being the most loyal Thin Lizzy fan out there, I do recommend ""Bad Reputation"" without hesitation."
5,Best yet from classic line up,"This release followed Jailbreak and Johnny the Fox and was probably the best studio album from this line-up.The duelling guitars of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson were never better,and the live dates provided much of the material for Live And Dangerous.Check out Downtown Sundown and That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart for examples of lesser known tracks ,and Southbound ranks as one of their all-time classics.Their material was never again so consistently strong.Buy it!"
3,"Get it for ""Dancin in the Moonlight!""",What can I say? I bought this album for Dancin' in the Moonlight. I heard a band do it live at Penn State WB in 1985 and have loved that song ever since. Awesome tune.
3,Didn't know,"Well, I had never heard this talk about Thin Lizzy even having a remote resemblance to The Boss! (Springsteen). And I love both artists!!Bad Reputation is not their best. All guitars are played by Gorham, since Robertson was abesent due to illness.Not all the songs are fantastic, but there's enough material here to remind us of the amazing quality guys like Lynott and Gorham and Downey had at those times, releasing a new album every single year, and most of those albums were better than anything mos of today's bands release!!"
1,NOT REMASTERED,This is the same as the 1996 version. You have to turn your volume way up to hear it clearly. I'll stick with the 2003 Japan release which has amazing sound compared to this retread version.
5,One Of Thin Lizzy's Top Three Albums,"Next to Johnny The Fox and Thunder & Lightning this is one of my favorite Thin Lizzy albums. It contains gems like Soldier Of Fortune, Southbound, Dancing In The Moonlight, Dear Lord, and the title track (Downey's drums on fire!). Phil's songwriting is superb and the guitar playing of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson is excellent (I still think Another Perfect Day w/ Brian is Motorhead's best album). Thin Lizzy was a band that put out a string of great albums but unfortunately is only remembered for a couple songs (just like Blue Oyster Cult). Get this great album and enjoy some good music!"
5,Thin Lizzy strike again!,"If you compare most rock bands of today with Thin Lizzy, it would be obvious that Lizzy were far more talented, creative and skilful. The lyrics by Phil Lynott are usually very good and it's not just empty words that sound cool or right to a particular song. Thin Lizzy had the ability to play anything from the hardest rock (""Bad reputation"") to the most melodic and emotional pieces (""Dancing in the moonlight""). On this album, there's plenty of great songs that never gained the attention they deserve, ""Southbound"", ""That woman's gonna break your heart"", and ""Dear Lord"" are all in the line of the finest Thin Lizzy ever recorded."
3,First timer,"The glove will work for the price. I assumed the color would match the one in the picture so if you think you are getting anything different than the other ones you find online where the strap is yellow...its the same. I had to alter the glove to get my hand into it. I probably should have ordered the extra large to fit my hand into it, but the finger pads wouldnt have been long enough. Overall, I should be happy with the product. It is just a lot different than I expected."
3,Air Hawk Helicopter,"Initially the helicopter would not hover. A friend re-set the rotar blades; and we can get it to fly now, but it isn't very responsive to the throttle button, seems like a time lag, between the remote throttle and the descent of the airship."
4,great set,"I did not purchase mine from here however I do own a copy and it is an awesome set for when I want to find out about a word and cross reference it to another dictionary as this includes a dictionary in the set, I have one other set slightly older but Id have to say this is a pretty good one."
1,Which Women?,"A truly interesting book would be, why do profoundly, unhappy, single, childless women tend to be liberal, why do they blame everyone else for their unhappiness and why have THEY waged a war on women who disagree with them."
5,The Christains self titled album,"This is a great disk; I bought it in London after listening to a song on the BBC. Took it skiing in the Alps and thought I was in heaven. Made my hole ski trip fantastic, until I when off that little cliff.Joe"
1,Kinda funny,"It really is mostly just Youtube clips of girl fight and bad dancing, but some of it's just plan funny it's so bad. Like a cheap horror movie can be. It's a poor man girls gone wild, but with a name like hood rats what do you expect. It would have been a 3 star if they had actually shown some girls doing stuff, but not even so much as a topless girl."
1,Hood Rat ARE Crazy,"Hoped for some insight about why things are the way they are 'in the hood'. All you get is some smart-mouthed, obnoxious, needs-to-be-taken-down-a-notch kid who totally disrespects everyone he encounters. Especially women; color does not matter. And what's with the 'ni**ah this and ni**ah that'? Why must African Americans refer to themselves with this moniker knowing full well it's derogatory connotation and explosive history? I do not hear older African Americans using this foul word - because they lived it. It is a shameful word that should not be flung about as it is by young African Americans. These young people were not around when this word was used to describe Black America. This is one word that should definitely be put to bed. Wise-up young African Americans, you want respect? Act respectful... especially to each other."
1,What's wrong wid Afro americans,I watch aye documentary that blew mi mind. Total disrespect of aye race of people. Talking about going backward. Never new how badly Afro Americans needed guidance. The director of this movie should be brought tah the movie board and be reprimanded from making other junk and the particapents of violence should be arrested.
2,u got to start somewhere????,everyone has to start somewhere... this is a first for them... i hope the next will be alittle better... as long as u learn from your first mistakes...ya feel me...
1,hood rats gone crazy,THIS FILM IS NOT GOOD AT ALL I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON SHOWING A FILM WITH LITTLE KIDS ON IT IN THIS KIND OF WAY!!
1,Hood Rats Gone Crazy,What a bunch of loosers potraying the black community as negative. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. A pawn movie is better than this.
1,hood rats gone wild,the dvd wasnt long docomentery on bs fights waste of my money for 5 scenes of bull i want my money back another choice of movie thank you
4,Embezzlement for a good cause?,Carib does a little embezzeling to help his village survive the reign of a greedy king.
1,Save your money!!!,"Elmer Smith's new book is as interesting as his dry, uninspired journalistic pieces he has been writing for the last 20 years in the Philadelphia Daily News. I don't understand how Elmer's writing or his view on life is even remotely viewed as humorous, even in a satorical manner. He should stick to writing about boxing and leave the observations of the world to others. I think the only one who is laughing is Elmer Smith - and no one gets it."
2,oK for what I paid,PRO: Arrived QuicklyCONS: The attached marker pen was drier than the Sahara. .......Not sure how long this was in storage. No issue though..the board works fine
3,I had hoped for an insole with the Tuli heel cup,"I have tons of insoles, and these are decent. I also have several Tuli heel cups which I think are excellent at cradling and supporting the heel. What I wish Tuli made were insoles that have their full heel cup built in so we could have arch support along with heel adjustment. When I saw the waffle heels on these insoles, I dared to hope that Tuli had combined the two, but alas, it was only a slight indent. Frankly I think the Spenco supports with firm arches are better, even without the heel cup.Tuli, if you are listening: your heel cups are your best asset- try combining them with an insole that gives good arch support and you will have a winner!"
4,Could have been 5 stars,"Do not let the picture fool you. The jar will not be filled once you receive the product. I know products settle in transit, but I think this settled way too much. The jar is 3/4ths filled. For the price, the jar should have been stuffed. I would have given this product 5 stars, but considering in my opinion 1/4 is missing, I did not. If I need more whole cloves in the future, I most probably will purchase it again."
1,It's not what it says it is,"The title of this book is so misleading. I was looking for a poetry, not for a religious new born Christian propaganda. You could've put somewhere that this was Christian brainwashing poetry and not about real people's real feelings behind the bars. I want my money back."
2,Repetitive,"I read this book, as well as another one. Well, this one was ok, but the other one( I no longer remember then name) was... exactly the same book, with exactly the same plot. It's all the same: a group of people with verious problems on their habds go to the world of the wll and find out that they have even greater problems... they don't have hands! now the problems are at their claws!Anyway, it's ok. Not spectacular in any way, though"
4,"Interesting, light, action-packed and fascinating.","I like sometimes the books that give you a small rest from heavy thinking. This is not ""DUNE"" or ""RINGWORLD"" or ""UBIC"". It's a fun adventure in the playground of Jack L.Chalker. I think that he just wanted to exercise his xenobiology abilities, and then desided to make a book out of it. Anyway it's a nice one, well writen and jumpy. Not a masterpiece but pretty cool."
4,One of my all time favorite scifi series,"If you like scifi, just read it. The older paperback Amazon has a for a penny. You'll get hooked. I read the whole series about once a decade. It has a good plot, a surprisingly clever Universe, and decent writing."
3,Steinbeck and his Boyhood Dreams,"Like most first time authors, Steinbeck looked for inspiration in his imagination. Fascinated with the swashbuckling pirates, he tests the literary waters with his first work. While it is lengthy and overly flowering in parts, it is a wonderful starting point to tracing his lengthy career. Strangely enough, in his later years, he once again turned to childhood inspiration when he penned his ""King Arthur"" stories. A study of the two also provides an intriguing subject."
2,He got much better................,"This is a romanticized telling and not something that would make you try Steinbeck -- if you want him writing non-fiction I think his best is Log From the Sea Of Cortez, and otherwise, I like his Cannery Row books the best for light reading."
3,Only hints of the author he'd become,"I'd been looking forward to this book for years because it was John Steinbeck's first novel and was just hard to find. Then one of my AP Literature students bought a copy for me. (No, it didn't help his grade.) This was, well, and interesting read. There were flashes here and there of the great author Steinbeck was to become, but overall it was kind of overwritten with some stilted and archaic dialogue. Also, the buildup to the capture of the Red Saint, as given in the introduction and the back cover, made it seem like she was going to be an important part of the story, when in truth she wasn't that important. Probably the most irritating thing about the story was that the ending seemed very passive. Possibly a stylistic choice by the young author, but not one I liked very much.This one is primarily for die-hard Steinbeck fans or those with a passion for pirate stories. It has a few beautifully written passages, but it isn't one I'll be returning to anytime soon."
3,Life lessons woven into story,"""Cup of Gold"" is Steinbeck's first published novel. Although it is not as well-written as his more famous novels--""East of Eden"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath""--it is still an entertaining tale with some interesting life lessons woven into the narrative."
1,Steinbeck in the rough,"Another reader-reviewer refers to Cup of Gold as ""Steinbeck in the rough"". That's accurate. I love Steinbeck's humor-as developed in later novels-here if falls flat on its face, and there is nothing else about it to recommend. There is none of the marvelous psychological/philosophical insight of later Steinbeck. The characters are uninteresting, the plot is without intrigue or interest. The best I can say about Cup of Gold, is it is at least free of the immature political ideology of some Steinbeck novels (the lesser ones in my view). However, I take cheer from Cup of Gold, and recommend it to all of my friends who are struggling with first novels. If Cup of Gold could be published, and the author went one to become one of the greatest writers ever-then there is hope for those of use who are struggling with first novels."
5,very important stuff,"i found this book to be dealing with all the issues facing modern man in a clear, concise and integrated way and revealing all the relevant ideas necessary to help an individual understand his place in all this confusion. Much of the underlying philosophy is based on 'Objectivism' and that is much to its credit. I was a little sceptical about the unified field theory given as the basis of the whole universe and took that part with a pinch of salt. Some great insights nevertheless and I took away a lot from it.ThanksVince"
1,OSD? Maybe LSD ...,"I tried to take this author seriously, but one just cannotafter so many pages like after like. Unfocused, meandering, obtuse -perhaps it requires a pathological delusion to appreciate. The triageof a reader's time must be taken seriously - save some of your ownwhile you can."
1,Absolute Nonsense.,Without exception everything Gellar has ever done has been shown to be simple slight of hand or common trickery. Claims which suface over and over concerning helping locate minerals and missing people have been proven without exception to be false. I like to know the truth and I will search out both sides of the argument to find that truth. In this work you only get the Gellar view and nothing else. Any work that covers such a contested area and does not present fair balanced arguments and evidence is worthless.
3,The Title Answer is: Both,"Although the author states in the Introduction that this work will be ""partly investigative journalism"" and ""partly a biography"", the majority of the narrative is pure hearsay, one-sided, pro-Geller. The lack of bibliographical references attests to that same point. But no matter, this man still makes a fascinating study. If he is for real, then he's one of the most curious insights into the powers of the human mind. If he's a phony, then he's one of the great magicians of our time. Either way, he's just plain interesting, and the reader is drawn to the next wierd story about Geller and his feats. For me, the bottom line was not so much ""Can he really do these things?"" but rather ""Why do people react so violently against the thought that he can?"""
4,Halleck and Burnside strike again,Very informative. Hampered by the pathetic nature of the engagement and the lack of the use of re-enactments. Bonus track on medicine in the civil war. Louis J Sheehan
1,Hated It!,"I think 'hate' is a very strong word for what I felt about this book, but it comes close. First of all, the description on the back of the book is very misleading. It isn't an E. Lynn Harris style, bisexual love triangle. That wasn't my real beef with the book, though. The ending is what truly made this book a terrible read for me. There's a lot of deceit and lies flying throughout this story, and by the end, the deceivers seem to be the ones placing all the blame on the deceived.There is very scant romance interspersed, and not a lot of steamy loves scenes to hang your hat on either. True, die-hard romance fans won't enjoy this book. Usually, Adrianne Byrd makes love stories come to life, but I must disagree with the other reviewers who liked this book and say it was a swing and a miss for Miss Byrd."
4,Family Matters,MEASURE OF A MAN is a delicious love story with a plot that goes a little over the top at times. It is a pretty well written novel that touches on the dynamics of friendship and the complexities of family relationships. The story flows nicely with humorous spots and has enough unresolved issues to leave an opening for a sequel.Reviewed by Autumnof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers
4,The Byrd does it again!,Adrianne Byrd continues to write stories that delight. And that's what MEASURE OF A MAN is! A delightful story that will make readers laugh and cry and laugh again.
5,Very interesting,"I thought it was unique how she slipped the homosexuality part in there, gave the story a twist and made it funny... Pretty good story, read it in one night"
4,It's been much too long,"I used to listen to this a lot in the late 80's but for some reason put it on the shelf and forgot about it. What was I thinking? Released in 1986, ""Big Night Music"" is Shriekback's fifth album that is overflowing with catchy pop/rock/techno tunes and great production. Dave Allen (bass) and Martyn Barker (percussion) are so tight that you will shake your head in disbelief and Barry Andrews (lead vocals/keys) has such a warm voice, great tone. These three are Shriekback, and guest musicians fill in the missing links.Not a dud on this disc but some standout tracks include... ""Black Light Trap"" grabs you immediately with a beefy trance-like groove accented by some nice horn arrangements; ""Pretty Little Things"" highlights multiple vocals backed only by percussion (skipping rimshots, bells, a milk bottle) and a jazzy keyboard lick, or ""Sticky Jazz"" with a sing-along R&B; sounding chorus. This is such a fun record that should be remastered and brought back into circulation."
5,Best Shriekback Album,"This is one of my favorite albums - ever. After reading the notes, you find out that these songs are about dreams - some pleasant, some unfit for dogs. ""Black Light Trap"" starts off the album - a high powered song. The albums ends with ""The Cradle Song"" which is very soothing. All styles are represented. Some of the highlights - ""Sticky Jazz"" - dancable funky song to ""Reptiles and I"" - kind of creepy. ""Running on the Rocks"" is a rockin song...but then again, all the songs have their moments when you're in the mood."
5,Great music if you liked the movie,"This soundtrack wasn't available when the movie first came out. I guess someone needed cash and put this out for sale. Well they made a little cash off of me because I had to have this. The movie is one of my favorites and the music here was written especially for the movie, (except the ""Sweet Dreams"" cover) and you can't hear this music anywhere else."
4,good cheap power grind,this album is one of the best i have bought for under a dollar. didnt know much about em until i heard a split with pig destroyer. this album is heavy and grinds quickly but yet interesting no annoying brake downs just pure power. buy all there albums.
2,"Ye gods, this is awful.","If you're only going to buy one Starlight Express recording, DON'T buy this one. I know it's the cheapest. But. If you're only after one, buy either the OLC (the 1984 double CD) or the new London cast (1992 single CD). This CD is amusing (in it's dreadfulness) for the dedicated fan like yours truly, but it is very bad. Even if you're collecting them all, make this one the last one you buy."
5,Just good rock and roll,"This is one of the most rare musical pleasure I've listend to. Kyf Brewer and the Conte brothers quite simply rock. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this CD. The vocal are great, song writing is great, and the guitar playing is outstanding. They were marketed as a heavy metal band, but they are clearly not. They are just a down to basics rock and roll band. Pick it up and enjoy."
4,"Best Parallel Clamps ""BAR NONE""","I bought my first pair of 40"" Jet Parallel Clamps nearly a year ago, and at the time I thought the price was too high. I had been using old bar clamps like my Father used, and thought I'd try something new. After several successful projects where completed I decided to replace all my bar clamps with Parallels. I picked up a pair of the Bessey K-Body Clamps, which work okay but do not site upright and level quiet as well as the Jets. Then Woodcraft came along with their version of the Bessey K body, cheaper, and not as well made as either the Jet or Bessey, but I tried out a set of them anyways, much to my disappointment. So this weekend I found a sale on the Jet Clamping Kit, and jumped on it, for eighty nine bucks, the price was right. I wish now that I had spent the money on the Jets in the first place, and I've learned my lesson the hard way...as usual."
4,good movie,"One of Chou's and Woo's famous movies. It combined with romance and violence, along with some humorous. Although it is not best one compare to today's action movies, it was great back to old days. It is one of mile stone of Hong Kong action movies in late 80's and early 90's."
4,Very pleased,"Overall, I'm very pleased with this apple slicer. It does take a little bit of strength to push it through the apple sometimes but that's okay. The main thing that bothers me is that there are some apples I buy that are too big for it, so I wish it were a little bit bigger. However, even with those I can use this to start it off and knife to finish it and have almost perfectly uniform slices."
2,Hard Core,"Thought this would be great--stainless steel & sturdy. It is sturdy, but hard to use; you have to rock it back and forth to get thru the apple. Was rather disappointed, it should work better. Made in China, so no instructions, either. I've used plastic ones that worked better."
4,Great device!,Very sturdy but not as sharp as my onion blossom slicer. The sizes are the same just the position of the blades on the device so I figure they should cut equally well. This feels very sturdy but I'm left wondering if there is a way to sharpen them.
3,Nice while it lasted,"The product worked reasonably well. It cuts evenly and I like the design that produces a larger number of slices than most slicers. It does not do well at cutting all the way through the bottom of the apple, but I don't know if any slicers do that well. After a year one of the blades broke, so now it has to go in the trash."
1,Didn't last,We received this last year for Christmas and it broke this week. I never quite liked the handling of it or how hard it was to push it down on the apple. Often times it would cut crooked and cut into the core. I am not happy with this product as it didn't last a year and it is manufactured in China. Enough said.
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this to replace the $6 plastic one we'd bought at Ralph's (Kroger) a couple of years previously - one of the handles broke. I figured this would be better, being of all metal construction - I was right and wrong. Nothing happened to the handles, but the cutters themselves gave out. We bought this on 25APR09. In June, one of the cutter pieces came loose (the spot weld that held it to the corer came undone), but it still worked. Yesterday (20SEP09), that whole piece (two cutters), popped out, making this a ten-slicer instead of a twelve. The $6 one lasted longer - end of story."
3,Sturdy but small and not that sharp.,"I got this one because a number of other reviews commented on how solidly built it is. It is made very well with stainless steel and doesn't feel like some cheap piece of plastic that will break apart. That's the good part...the bad parts are that the whole things seems to be a bit smaller, so if you are trying to cut larger apples they just barely seem to fit and the corer is a bit too small so that you have to cut out what it leaves behind. It also doesn't seem to be as sharp as it should be since you really have to lean on it and kind of wobble it to cut through a decent sized apple."
4,"Nice item, but...","I have never owned one of these units before, so I cannot compare it to something else except good old fashioned slicing and coring. I like the size of the slices. The unit doesn't peel and the center cut is a tad too small. I have to finish the coring to get the frequent seed hard part out. Otherwise, I am glad I bought it"
3,Sturdy but needs tweaking,"I bought this to replace a deteriorating plastic-framed Oxo. I like getting twelve slices instead of eight. I like the all-metal design.However the coring center should be a larger diameter. I frequently have to trim the seeds from larger apples.Also the blade needs better sharpening and tapering. The Oxo had a better blade design; the radial blades were spot-welded to the core and then sharpened as one unit. But this Leifheit has tabs fastening the radial blades to the center. Those tabs create friction and catch a lot of apple fiber that has to be scrubbed out. A taller blade would also help stability as the blade is pushed down.I would buy the Leifheit again, but we still find the Oxo easier to push."
1,Not well made,"It worked fine for about 25 apples, then the blades broke away from the ring. Based on the other reviews, I may have received a defective sample, but I can't recommend."
1,Apple Slicer,Didn't work on solid apples like granney smith. Apples must also be symetrical and not too firmLeifheit Pro Line Stainless Steel Apple Slicer/Corer
3,Worked for a while,"I can't remember what I paid for this a long time ago, but I do remember that it worked well for a while and then it fell apart. I got a lot of use out of it but it seemed odd at the time that it broke. I've since bought a Rubbermaid and it is still like new."
3,"Kingsmen Quartet Anniversary CD, 35 years","This isn't one of my favorite CD's by the Kingsmen, I suppose because most of these in the lineup were not my favorites. The sound is still good, typical Kingsmen sound."
4,Dead Battery!,I order this watch in goldtone through Amazon. Big Apple sent me the watch which I love - BUT - it had a dead battery. It costs me another $10.00 for battery replacement. Seems like a such little thing to actually check and make sure that the watch is running before it is sent to the customer.
5,Takes the warmth from my blood....,"Compromises is one example of album that you can play from track 1 to the very end. The songs flow together so smoothly almost like a story. Furthermore, NOF is unlike most emo/indie groups today. Their music contains so much emotion, expressed through Nick's angelic vocals, Jon's powerful drums, and not to mention Mike & Matt's clever, intricate guitars. I can honestly say that these songs are so amazing, they have the power to give you goosebumps and take the warmth from your blood. Do yourself a favor and pick this album up... it wont leave your cd player!""I love the way she moved. This all may change inside the bedroom. Lets wait for nerves to dim. This has to be the prettiest sin"""
5,Love them!,These guys are awesome I bought this cd at a concert I saw them at and the cd got stolen so I was super stoked to find it on amazon. :) :)
3,TRACK LIST (NOT ENHANCED) 10 SONGS,"Tracks:1. Come On2. It's Happening3. Can't Forget4. Prettiest Sin, The5. Don't Say Anything6. Nothing Will Change7. Distance, The8. Sorry9. Make The Cut10. There Went The WorldThis release is from an independent record label and was released in 2003"
4,Beautiful lamp,"This is a nice lamp- however the shade is not as bright as it appears in the picture, it is more of a pinkish beige"
3,nice looking from afar,it's made of cast latex so it's basically plastic. so i think it's overpriced at $280 and the shade isn't amber brown and gorgeous like in the sample photo at all. it's more terra cotta and the wash technique was poorly executed. luckily i'm artistic and can give it an amber wash which should make it more to my liking. but unfortunately most people who buy it may be disappointed in what they get. maybe amber bulbs will help. if it were around $175 i'd have given this lamp 5 stars.
1,Ugly lamp with no aesthetic warmth,"The lamp doesn't look like the photo based on which I ordered two each. The lamp casts a very dark ugly light. I had to return them. I guess this is the problem with ordering lamps sight-unseen. Other buyers have said the same thing. So, I should have read the feedback."
5,Going Deeper Into God's Presence,"I absolutely LOVE this CD!!! I have listened to it many times, and will play it often. I love listening to it in my car when I'm driving, too. My Friends are amazed at it, as was I. And, the music is perfect. Listening to this CD taselfkes you Deeper, as it builds upon itself. I love God so much, and if you're looking for a CD to use in meditation and worship for your very own, you won't regret this one. It is so amazing! I never knew there were so many Names of God, that I'd been missing. Listen to it often."
4,I Am: 365 Names of God CD,"I really enjoy this CD...it is calming and thought provoking, so it is easy to listen to and meditate on...the only thing I did not like is the fact that it does not have but one track... so one can't back up to listen to a specific 'chapter' I can't"
2,I AM,very exciting content. Very poor quality CD. The CD skips. I tried it on several players and it skipped on all of them.
4,Good meditation on the Names of God,I found John Paul Jackson's CD to be an excellent meditation on the names of God. The background music is appropriate and gives one a sense of grandeur and the majesty of God. I have used it for personal worship and intend using it as an alternative form of worship in the context of prayer boiler rooms etc. Pastor Phil Robson
5,Beautiful book highlighting the attributes of God,"The quality of this book is just fantastic. But more importantly, what's inside is even better, because it's filled with Scriptures that focus on God's attributes. When you go through this book and take time to really think about the characteristics of each of God's names, you start to realize just how awesome He is. Great book to help deepen your understanding of God and enrich your walk with Him."
1,Not very helpful to me...,"This book was a disappointment. Based on other reviews, I thought it would be the happy middle between a ""nuts-and-bolts"" type of book and a textbook with a lot of theoretical discussion. This book was neither, and weak in almost all respects.The book read somewhat like an undergraduate term paper, with overuse of ""witty"" commentary. Based on the large font size, large figures, lots of white space, and way too much extraneous commentary, this book is really much ""thinner"" than its 300+ pages suggest - not a good value.In short, there is not much meat here. I would advise looking elsewhere - compromises are often bad choices."
2,Very little substance ...,"I did not find this book very useful. I suppose I was looking for more of a book on Access and the application of relational databases. I should have picked up ""Grover Park George ON ACCESS"" and avoided this one.However, even if I only had only wanted to learn the basics of relational databases, I should not have bought this book. It has about 25% of the substance that I would expect from a book of its length. The author explains every little thing over and over, and explains why he's explaining things, then provides more examples than necessary. To me, this book was an unfortunate waste of time."
5,Wish I had this when I started working with databases,"This is one of the best books I've read to get someone started in the world of relational databases. As a former software trainer, I've recommeded several database books to students. But I wish I had known about this one for my beginning students. Sure, there are the 800 page monsters out there, but if you want information that is straight to the point, well-written and user-friendly, this is the book to use. I'd also like to point out that the one time I had a question, I was able to contact Dr. Whitehorn and within an hour, I received a my answer. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the basics about relational databases."
2,Caused diarrhea and I have IBS-C,I have IBS -C. Was having a lot of stomach issues and thought I'd try this. Caused diarrhea which was a surprise and didn't help my stomach. After the fact I looked at the ingredients and the first ingredient listed is sucrose. I don't do well with sugar items.
2,The Strange World of Alvin Plantinga,"Talk about an ivory tower academic who is out of touch with the real world. If you have the same confidence in your belief in God as you do in your sense-perceptions and memmories, then you will agree with what Plantinga says. But if you are like the other 99.99999% of humanity, you will find his arguments strange and unconvincing."
5,Amazing film,"Truly amazing film about young people who are Christian, and have had to struggle with the question ""Why did God make me gay?"" Very powerful testamony as some recall family who threw them out of the house, and friends who turned their backs on them, all the while keeping God at the center of their lives. A MUST for any church that wants to honestly deal with how one can be gay AND Christian."
4,Worth Reading....But Not Enough to Save You?,"If you buy this book, I strongly suggest a companion volume THE IMMORTALIST MANIFESTO by Elixxir. It goes beyond what R. Michael Perry has done in this book. Instead of putting most of our eggs into the Cryonics (i.e. freezing) basket, THE IMMORTALIST MANFIESTO, in stirring minimalist prose, provides a most compelling vision of the coming Immortalist Society, and how it will arrive. And it argues that the anti-aging life-extension breakthroughs are not likely to come in time for most of us, especially baby boomers, unless there is an Immortalist Movement powerful enough to make such breakthroughs happen soon.Why read this book? It just might save your life."
3,Phantom Brave: The Official Strategy Guide,If you got time; correction. If you have days to give to a game this book will help the days go faster. Phantom Brave is another great game from NIS so if you like disgaea games and need a little help; this guide will be awesome helper.
1,Right Ladies?????,Please read all of the other 2 or 1 star reviews to get a real summary of the book. Also 'Manifesting' Making something out of nothing. Bunch of BS. Thanks for needing to MAKE me better because you know all about it!There are some good ideas but a smarter person needs to come up with how to use them.
3,Take It With A Grain Of Salt,"Contains some interesting insights, but I can't say that I agree with everything in the book. However, that can be said about any book that makes sweeping generalizations about either sex as a whole. However, it does have some very pertinent info that she explains much more clearly than most women are able to do. It's written for me, of course, but as a woman it was nice to hear that some of the issues my boyfriend and I deal with are not limited to us alone. I read it and marked the pages I thought were important for him to read :) But I wouldn't give any man the book and tell him to live his life by it."
3,great sex advice,"Guys, if you take away nothing else from this book, take the section on making love to a woman as good advice."
2,"Should be called ""What men do wrong""","A friend let me borrow this book after they finished it and I have to say that this book was probably the most sexist thing I have encountered that aimed directly at men. The author obviously has had several bad relationships and has failed at each one. At one point she defended her own views by saying that making plans, scheduling and planning events without considering the man's opinion at all was not being controlling but ""creating"" and ""caring"". The author seems to be a control fiend with a superiority complex. I especially enjoied how she went on a long rant about how men don't know where the clitoris is or how to use it and went into great detail about how (she likes) to have it stimulated.While this book did have a few good points to consider, the rest of it was just male bashing and a huge rant that would be better suited on a livejournal or myspace blog."
1,Frustrating read,"The book read like a collection of COSMO articles on insecure, needy, emotionally fragile women. I find it difficult to believe women are like what was presented in the book, and if they are, would you really want others, including men, to know about it?Maybe there was some substance, but the writing style ruined ""the message""."
2,What Women Want Men To Know,"Well, the front cover says this is the ultimate book about love, sex and relationships for you and the man you love. That's a big statement. So, what did I think of this book?Insightful is the word that comes to mind concerning this. Many times men and women don't communicate their feelings very clearly to one another and I think this book breaks some of those barriers down. It definitely explains how each member thinks concerning many various issues including myths, communication and techniques for being the perfect lover.Personally, I wish this book had been around a few years back. I would encourage men and women alike who want a greater understanding of the opposite sex to read this book."
2,Disappointed,"Of all the landscape books I ordered in 2004 this was the the biggest disappointment. I got the impression the author tries to convince me about his personal definition about what landscape photography is, with examples of images I wouldn't take a second look at.If you're interested in beauty of nature and not in an abstract thesis about the definition and value of art look for books from Art Wolfe or Jack Dykinga."
3,Good book but lacks important information,"Denny Martin Flinn presents a very good book about little known musical theatre works and provides the reader with a clear a concise overview of many shows. However, what is lacking - and most important - is what the shows call for in the way of musicians. Book provides nice info as far as synopsis, original cast, musical numbers, licensing, and some difficulties/advantages, but what about the size of the orchestra? Why is it that in a ""Musical"" the instrumentalists are always the first to be cut (or reduced) but last to be considered? It's first and foremost a musical, not play and this information should be considered along with sets, costumes, and props. Perhaps in a future edition Mr. Flinn can add this most important of information."
4,The greatest actor of our time,This is a must have for any Al Pacino fan. Grobel gets the normally shy Pacino to open up. Now I just can't wait for the Al Pacino DVD Collection to be released.
5,What I need to seek for...,This is 4th book by MLJ which I read. it helped me to understand why we need Holy Spirit seriously nowadays.it leaded me to repent and seek for the true joy with Holy Spirit and yet need to seek for the batism of Holy Spirit.Let's ask Him pour His Spirit by seeking for His face with importunity.
5,Joy Unspeakable by Martyn Lloyd-Jones,"This is one of the best explanations of the baptism in the Holy Spirit that I have read, backed up completely with biblical theology by a Spirit-filled, brilliant servant of God."
4,A good read,I liked it. For anyone that has experienced great pain. This book can definitely help you put things in perspective and realize God can still turn it around!
4,Wow!,"I heard the song ""I'm like a bird"" on Vh1 late one evening, and couldn't get the song out of my head. The next day I downloaded a couple of songs to see if I would like any others on the cd before I went out and bought it. Needless to say, I loved every track, and ran to the store to pick it up. It has been in the cd player ever since. I'm thrilled to have something different to listen to. Nelly has such a unique voice and sound thats just like a breath of freah air. I saw her in concert last night in Cleveland, and I just have to tell you, WOW!!! I thought the cd was great, wait till you see her perform! The songs are done even better than the cd! She did a much slower tempo version of IMAB, which brought the house down! She is very high energy performer that is a ""must see""!"
5,The Wonderful Nelly Furtado,"Nelly Furtado, besides being beautiful, is incredibly talented. Her mixture of Hindi, portuguese, and various other influences shine through in this wonderful CD. In case you're curious i am a 23 yr old male from NYC who does not like this genre of music but has been turned into a serious Nelly Fan."
5,The BEST album I've heard in a long time,"I am not really into music but when I first heard the song ""I'm Like a Bird"" I was so struck by it. There I was in my car and all of a sudden, this awesome song comes on. I knew that I had to find out who the singer was and where I could buy the CD. That day I went out to buy the CD and I have not stopped listening to it since. I also went on the internet to find out everything I could about Nelly Furtado. I have to say that she is amazingly talented and very beautiful. I have never felt so excited and giddy about an artist or and album before. This is a truly great CD and you will missing out on a lot of great music if you choose not to get it. An album that can get me hooked is worth listening to."
3,"Whoa, Nelly! Whoa what a nice surprise!","This album just reminds me of what summer should be in a perfect world. Long, hot, lazy days, the beach, no work, no early out of bed mornings... mmm. A fine debut collection from Furtado will ensure that she will be the next ""big thing"". She actually reminds me of a more cheerful and ""with-it"" Natalie Imbruglia. The star of the album is ""I'm Like A Bird"". The other singles that have been released, ""Turn Off The Lights"" and ""... On The Radio"" are the strongest tracks on the album. ""Whoa, Nelly!"" has quite a bit of filler but is quite easy on the ear and is generally of a consistently high standard. Some may find Furtado's voice slightly annoying. If you are one of them you would probably not find this album a pleasant experience."
3,A Fun and Lively CD,"I mainly bought this CD because it had my favorite songs like ""Turn off the Light"" and ""I'm Like a Bird"" which are fun and cool to listen to. I also like some others like ""Well,Well"" and ""Trynna Finda Way"" I think Nelly Furtado has a unique song style that other pop singers don't have. I would enjoy her CD more if she had put less swear words. Overall, I liked this CD and would recommend it. Here are my song ratings:Hey, Man!- 2/5 (Again, I'd love this song if she didn't swear...)....On The Radio- 1/5 ( I skip this song :P)Baby Girl-3/5Legend- 2/5I'm Like a Bird- 5/5 (My favorite)Turn Off the Light- 5/5 (2nd Favorite)Trynna Finda Way-4/5 (Interesting, but a cool song)Party- 2/5Well, Well- 4/5My Love Grows Deeper- 2/5I Will Make You Cry- 3/5Scared of You- 3/5You should buy this CD!"
2,Nothing new and nothing fresh,"There is nothing new - style, beat, lyrics, look or obscenities. Her voice is passable, but better can be found on some indy labels. Some of her songs actually makes me cringe! Her look is too similar to what is already out there. But it's the greatest pity that obscenity = creativity today; talent isn't enough to sell."
2,S#@$ on the radio...,"""I'm Like a Bird"" is the best pop song of the last ten years. Unfortunately, the rest of this album is terrible. ""Turn Off the Light"" is pretty good, though it suffers from the same crappy lyrics as the rest of the album. I haven't heard her new CD; I hope it's good, because she's obviously got a lot to offer musically and I think she will make some really great music once she figures out how to make a record and gets the lyrics issue sorted out.Also, whoever managed to hear bossa nova in this gets the creative-hearing of the year award."
1,What more can I say?,I thought I might enjoy this album.Yet I didn't.I dunno what Nelly F. be smokin' but she needs to puff and pass.I do though like her voice and respect her artmanship.No other producers writing terrible songs for Nelly.Hell no she writes her own.
1,HUH?!,"I've heard Nelly singing on TV a couple of times, and her voice is horrible! It's flat, she doesn't breathe properly and it's painful to listen to her voice. I can't believe her album has gotten good reviews. Just from listening to her, makes me NOT want to buy her album. I'm not tone deaf, which is why I'm amazed that so many people like her album. Huh?!"
1,"get your own sound, nelly!!!!!","Anyone that knows anything about the canadian music scene will tell miss nelly is a phoney. There is another canadian singer out there called ""Esthero"", and she is the real deal. Nelly copied her unique sound and made a mediocre album for the masses. And to make things worse, nelly has strayed away from this sound altogether and has made a top 40 hip hop album-yuck!!! At least esthero has stayed true to herself and is making music that just doesnt appeal to 'the norm'. But dont fret, esthero has gotten back at nelly. She released the single, ""o.g. bitch"". Check it out, it is sooooo good."
2,HELP THIS POOR GIRL FIND HER HOLE!,"I find it very sad that this talented and very attractive youngCanadian cannot find her hole or her soul as she plaintivelywhines through the first single. ...I know comparing her to everyone is easyand puts a lot of hyper links on the page, but really...? ...I would say Nelly sounds likea very shrill dog gargling syrup;("
3,Setting the Record Straight,"This is a great CD, no doubt. But for it to be called a product of Furtado's Brazilian culture makes no sense. She speaks Portuguese, but that's because her parents are from Portugal, not Brazil. Furtado is Canadian, she has no ties to Brazil, except for the fact that she speas their official language. Ican't beleive an editor who reviewed this CD could make such a huge mistake."
2,Nelly is a Bore!,"""Whoa Nelly"" is right! I wanted her to stop whining as soon as she started! I expected something more interesting and colorful, but I got a teenybopper quality music with a twist.... Sadly, it's a waste of 12 bucks."
4,good album,I am a big fan of music and especially of different sounds. Nelly Furtado definately has a different sound. I instantly liked the whole cd and got to know the lyrics. It has a good mix of upbeat songs and regular chill songs. Buy it.
3,"Whoa, Nelly!",What a great debut album!Nelly Furtado has definately proven herself worthy of all her success. Nelly hasn't won a ton of awards but has won a Grammy for Best female pop preformance!She's no Britney Spears!Her album takes you on a majical ride through her pop sound twisted with rock flares.Scince Nelly wrote and produced this album it proves she will be around for a long time.
4,Talent!,"Nelly Furtado has earned the right to be popular with this album. The most intriguing part of this ablum is the fact that she writes her music!!! Any artist that can do that is definately someone who can say they've made it to the top all on their own skills. Anyway, this cd has great music on it, with the hit songs like ""I'm Like a Bird"" ""Turn Off the Lights"" and "".... On the Radio."" All of the songs have catchy phrases and sections in them that you just want to sing over and over again, because of how wonderful they are. Furtado mixes pop with a whole heap of Latin American music styles, and creates her own style of music that is unmistaskable. Then to top it all off Furtado has a powerful voice that she uses to express herself very clearly. The best part though once again has got to be the fact that she writes her own stuff. So kudos to you Furtado for performing your own written stuff, and to every other artist that doesn't rely on someone else to write their tunes."
5,Amazing debut from a star with actual longterm value,"I despise most pop and r&b, and I suppose much of it is a lack of creativity. Enter Nelly Furtado.Nelly Furtado's first album is an original mix of pop, hip-hop (which i hate above all else, most of the time) and her latin roots to make something that sounds new and amazing. I'm Like A Bird is irrestibly catchy, Turn off the Light is very creative, and Hey Man could be the next single. She is also an excellent singer, and lets not forget she's 17 and writes brilliant lyrics.Nelly Furtado is a rising star, with talent and potential for a long career. Get it today!"
4,One of the best this year !,This cd is one of the best. I was able to listen to all the songs over and over. Very talented woman.... Turn off the lights is very danceable. This cd will have you dancing around your house. This cd takes you away from what your thinking about. Somehow it just cheers you up. I think it could be her voice...?????
4,Excellent,"Whoa Nelly is an excellent album that hasn't been off my stereo for ages. This debut album contains the massive hit single Like A Bird and other top class tracks like Hey Man, Baby Girl, and standout tracks like On The Radio and Turn Off The Light. You can tell from this debut that Nelly has been influenced by so many people and we can only hope that they keep inspiring her to make music this good again"
4,Incredibly refreshing!,"Amazing2 girl!Do not be fooled by simple, hippie-ish, Lilith type cover. This album has got class!!How often can you someone this young fuse thesounds of bossa nova,urban, samba, electronica and pure pop into one delightful package. Standouts incl ""Hey Man"" with its catchy violin samples, ""Baby Girl"" with that tight rhythm and cute cooing, the bouncy ""Well, Well"", the soaring ""Im Like a Bird"", and also the beautiful ""Scared of You"" whwere Nelly sings part of it in Portugese.If you are a fan of quality music, get this album!And this is coming from a rock music fan!!"
3,Needs [Alot] of Work.,"Ms. Furtado is a very attractive young lady, and she [can] have a great voice. It's not just the nasal feature, it's the whole attitude that comes across-like in ""I'm like a bird"", in the beginning she sounds like she's half asleep!""I'm like a bird"" and ""turn off the light"" are like diamonds in the rough compared to the other songs on this track. She curses far too often, and the beats simply don't have those infectious rhythms[like in ""bird""]."
4,Wow! Where did she come from??,"Nelly Furtado displays a simply beautiful debut album. Her voice and songs sound like a mixture of Lauren Hill, Fiona Apple, Gwen Stefani <from No Doubt>, and with a bit of her own style. There are edgy, with worldly rythms, and definilty catchy. But there is a downside, you can only listen to this cd so many times without getting slightly tired of the songs, but I would definitly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a different sound from most of the females who are dominating the charts today. This album proves that Nelly Furtado is more than a pretty face."
5,Her Sound is Addictive!,"This is one of the best CDs I have purchased in some time. I can't stop playing it. It's rare that I enjoy absolutely every song on an album, but in this case, Nelly Furtado's sound is so different and upbeat that I can't say enough about it. Her sound is very unique, and can't be summed up in any one genre of music. Her lyrics come from the heart, and tell a story of where she's been. The radio plays plenty of ""I'm Like A Bird"", but this album has so much more to offer."
4,NELLY FURTADO ON THE RISE!,"I first saw Nelly Furtado singing her single ""Like A Bird"" on Saturday Night Live a month or so ago.Never saw or heard of her before then. When she sang (and SNLs acoustics are never good!) she sounded fantastic! I said who is this lady she is great!, unfortunately I forgot to write her name down, and forgot about her. .....Than thanks to VH1 they started playing her video, and I said I really like this ladys voice, and I know I have seen her before, then my friend reminded me of SNL....Well I ran out and bought the CD and it is a nice surprise. Well produced, great talented voice, this lady has a future. Though when I give an album 5 stars ALL the songs have to be great, so I give Nelly 4 because there are some fillers on the CD, a couple or so.The CD cover brings me back to the 70s design. Who ever her graphic artist was for this CD was very creative....and the album is too!The Best New Artist for 2001 Grammies goes to....NELLY FURTADO!"
4,Pretty Good,"I like this CD. It mixed different cultures and Nelly's unique voice with lots of rythem. Although it dooes not have many smooth melodys it is light, lively and inspiring. My favorite songs are I'm Like A Bird and Well Well. Over all this CD is not for every one."
3,THE LAUNGAGE!!!,"""Well, Well"" Is one of the tracks, and best suits this CD. It is a REALLY good CD, but don't let that fool you. Nelly Furtado may have some talent, but I am here to warn you, that if you buy this BEWARE!!! Nelly Furtado says that this record was made with love, but would you say, saying obscene words is ""Loving????"" Nelly Furtado swears in ""Hey, Man!""""...On the radio""(the real title inside the CD is ""s-- on the radio"")""Baby Girl""""Party""""My love grows deeper"" and ""I will make U cry."" As you can see 6 out of the 13 tracks. And(as I live in Canada, and am 4 months ahead of you guys in singles)Nelly Furtado, will certainly lose fans(she lost me)She will release ""...On the radio"" next then release""Hey, Man!""(and I have descovered that across Canada, they don't censor the chorus)Who knows what dirty song she will release next.So I am warning you!!! ONLY BUY THIS IF YOU CAN STAND HAVING EVERY SECOND WORD BE A BAD WORD!!!"
1,Nelly Furtado???,"The little obnoxious lady is just as obnoxious as her music!And she just was that way at the grammys and gave a real poor rendition of her hit song ""I'm like a bird"" no vox backups, no music support except for an electric guitar player.I can't understand what is the hooplah with this cd and this canadian who is obviously not from there. I give her one star for vocal ability. ...and she could have come up with a stage name other than Furtado. To me she sounds like a 5 year roll having romp-around in the backyard!"
5,"Whoa, Nelly! What a cool name for a CD.","I absolutely loved this CD. In my opinion Nelly Furtado should have won more Grammy's than Alicia Keys. I liked it and I think you will too.1. Hey Man- 8/102. On the Radio- 10/103. Baby Girl- 9.5/104. Legend- 10/105. I'm Like a Bird- 8/106. Turn Off the Light- 7/107. Trynna Find a Way- 10/108. Party- 10/109. Well, Well- 9/1010. My Love Grows Deeper- 6/1011. I Will Make You Cry- 7/1012. Scared of You- 6/10All in all it was pretty good. Well worth your money!"
5,"Whoa, grate CD, Nelly!","I don't know about you, but I loved this CD. One grate mix of styles; bossa nova, pop... what else can you ask for? My favorite songs in this albom were: ""Legend"" and ""Baby girl""! If you don't have this CD, get it now. And by the way, all those samples of 15 seconds from the song are not useful here. The songs are WAY better then they are in those samples. One last thing, if I may... GO NELLY!!!"
4,Great music for adult ears only,"I purchased the CD because I had heard the two singles and was interested. The CD did not disappoint -- the songs are unique with interesting tempos and rhythms. I was also impressed that most, if not all, songs were written or co-written by the artist. A word of warning for parents, though. There are three songs which have words which I do not want my children exposed to. In fact, one song is called "".... on the Radio"" The blank is a 4-letter word which you don't discover until you open the CD and the word is prominent in both the beginning and end of the song. I was greatly dismayed that there is no parental warning on the album anywhere. So, while the music is good, beware if you are buying this for children, especially pre-teens."
3,"Great Voice, Great Music, need a better band","When you listen to this album, imagine, if all the sounds appearing to emanate from one of those $29.99 keyboards which suddenly spring up around your local electronics store at Christmastime every year, were replaced with real musicians, how incredible this music could be...Her voice soars with versatility. The music is creative and distinctive. If only the production were not tuned for a 12 year old. If she had invited Carlos for the guitar riffs in ""Tynna Finda Way""? If the drums had soul anywhere in the album?It would rate all 5 stars that so many other have so easily donated.OK so you say I'm sounding like Simon.... If Nelly were on any of these American Asteroid Search shows she'd be certain to make it all the way. But, then again, on TV we accept a mediocre backing."
2,"Whoa, she's cute, but...","I could barely get through this CD. The problem is not the composing or the lyrics, it's her voice! The girl sings through her nose through every song. With her accompanying herself on background vocals, it reminded me of a kazoo band. I did notice that on several songs, she drops the nasally tone in a few the background tracks, proving that she really can sing, but for some reason she chooses to sing in this annoying way.But she is adorable!"
1,WHOA! Nelly got a record deal!,"Nelly. Nelly. She is very good looking. Like other no-talent girl-clowns (Britney, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore..i can go on.) Her good looks and simple-catchy pop-fizz lyrics are getting her by. And people are eating her up. Where have we gone in music today? Down...Low...Waaaay Down Low... music like this is catchy...but lacks any substance. Yo, props to Madonna, keep it real."
2,"Alanis Morrisette, Part Deux","That's right. If you liked Naked Gun, you'll like Naked Gun, Part Deux. That's how I describe this album by Nelly Fartado. Sounding like Alanis Morrisette is a GOOD reason to stay away from this. Although a few tracks are good, it's not enough to turn the entire album around. I feel cheated when I buy an album and only one or two songs qualify as singles and the rest blow. Do yourself a favor and just listen to your little sister scream."
2,Promising debut but I will catch ya in a few years,"I was intrigued by the song ""like a bird"" and decided to take a chance on this album. There are a few standout songs, like ""legend"" and ""Scared of You"". She is daring in her vocal acrobatics however, some of the trite lyrics tend to get in the way.The album seems bogged down by too many conflicting influences and not enough depth. Nelly Furtado has a promising voice but I think that she will need a few years to grow as an artist. This is a pretty good album. If I picked it up a few years ago I would love it. The sticker prides her to be in the same veign as Fiona Apple but the voice is the only thing that is vaguely familiar.I will catch Nelly in a few years. For now it is back to my Fiona Apple cd that never fails to inspire and capture the deepest depth of emotion."
1,YUCK! Buy the single instead!,I fell in love with 'I'm like the bird' only to be crushed with how lame the rest of the CD was. It's cross between music that sounds like it came from a synthesizer type keyboard with lyrics written by a freshman. I literally can't stand to listen to any other song on the CD besides 'I'm like the bird' - which is a truly great song. I guess this is one of those one hit wonder type of deals. At least in my humble opinion.
3,its good but not great,"i feel like this cd is dominated by songs like ""turn off the lights"" and ""hey man"" but some others like ""tryanna find a way"" and ""party"" suck.thats it. shes talented but i feel that she can be a bit more r and b like she was in turn off the lights;a good buy for people who enjoy hard rap with cultural beats"
3,How was this compared to Fiona and Tori?,"When I bought this CD yesterday, a brightly colored banner exclaimed, ""Fans of Fiona Apple and Tori Amos? You'll love Nelly Furtado's critically acclaimed album!"" Sadly, the print lied. The first two songs on the album are actually pretty catchy, except she curses a lot and unecessarily in them. Using profanity in songs is fine and all, but she made those two potentially good songs lose its merit. Most of the other songs are basically . . . fluff. The songs have a good beat, and her voice is unique, but the content isn't as thought provoking as people have made it out to be."
3,I may be over-stepping my generosity here...,"I'd heard so many good things about this album, and ran out of things to buy last week, so I figured that ""Whoa, Nelly"" was as good a wasteful purchase as any. And I was about right, too.It's a strange album to rate, really... and it's a love-hate voice she's piping out, too shrill and weak (at least in the mix) to sustain your interest throughout the entire collection of songs, but with a breadth of originality in her compositions that makes you want to explore further...Frustration sinks in because of the potential lost.In short, appreciate the album for it's freshness and energy, for the simple fact that she's likely got only one in her. Ultimately it's got a few noteworthy, extremely hummable tunes, but it's no classic, and any 5-star ratings you see on Amazon regarding it are completely unwarranted."
2,Really only one good song,Turn Out The Lights is an amazing song. The lyrics were catchy & the beat is addictive. I was disappointed when I heard the rest of the cd only to find out no other songs were even remotely similar to this. The others are either just bland or have a strange rhythm that isn't my style. I'll probably add this song to my mp3 collection but forget the rest of the cd - it's a waste of time!
1,Better as just a single,"I bought this CD for that ONE song I heard on the radio and liked. If you're looking for others as catchy and good as ""I'm Like A Bird"", you won't find them here. The rest are slow and boring and I felt robbed that I paid $20 for one song."
2,Too Weird For My Tastes...,"Take my review with a grain of salt, I'm in no way saying this is a bad CD or a bad artist (I actually think Nelly may have potential). I'm just saying I didn't like it at all, personally. I think she kind of reminds me of a poppy/youthful Jewel or Alanis. Her songs have messeges, I'm sure, but I don't understand many of them. And her lyrics verge on two extremes; either laughably corny and simple (""I'm Like A Bird"", ""I Will Make You Cry"") to just weird (""Remember The Days""). But I do admit that ""I'm Like A Bird"" is pure pop bliss, a happy-go-lucky uptempo number with a beautiful orchestra opening and a catchy chorus. Nelly has a scratchy, deep and soulful voice, she reminds me a little of T-Boz from TLC. I didn't enjoy this record, but if you like adult-contemporary pop, you might like it."
2,Good Voice??!!,"I first came across Nelly Furtado when she performed on Letterman or some other late night show. I was immediately intrigued by her apparent lack of any talent - her moves were amusingly awkward and her voice actually worse than the average person's. So much so that I had to check out this album. Well I guess it's passable music, but kudos to the sound engineers. If you see her live, you'll probably know what I mean."
1,A Canadian Britney Spears Who Writes Her Own Songs,"So this girl writes her own songs. Who says that just because you write your own songs you instantly have talent? I saw her acceptance speeches at the Juno Awards and find her to be obnoxious and immature. I'm Like A Bird isn't any more original than half the garbage out there today. I don't want to disrespect anyone who likes Nelly's music, but she just isn't for me."
1,"Sorry, but it's the truth.","I know that I am going to get some negative feedback on this one. But I do have something nice to say. I bought the album and really wanted to throw it out the car window. I loved the single, like everyone else, but the rest of the album literally lacks direction. Nearly every song sounds exactly the same. The beatss are cool, but for how long. I do think she is creative and does have a powerful voice. I also have to credit her for writing her own stuff which is always impressive to me no matter how bad the song is. I will wait and see what she comes up with next. the nice thing that I have to say is that I did see her open up for David Gray and she is much better live than on record. Hopefully she will be able to incorporate her stage presence into her sophmore effort."
4,Took me about three years to enjoy,"When Nelly Furtado first came out, I couldn't stand her voice and image. She seemed like a spoiled-brat with limited singing talent. I changed my mind when I heard ""Powerless"" and I've been in love with her music ever since. I love her latest album more than this one, but ""Whoa, Nelly!"" is excellent in its own right. It's a shame her album ""Folklore"" isn't doing very well! Hopefully she'll be able to maintain a small but strong fanbase for years to come."
4,"Eclectic, at times soaring","Little cute Canadian Nelly Furtado is the flavor of the month, and that's pretty cool. She's all over the map with this nicely crafted record, which is bound to alienate some people. Throw in bossa nova, pop, grrl power folk, dub reggae, hiphop, world music, and who knows what else, and you've got Whoa Nellie! The Hit ""Like a Bird"" is a good showcase for her strengths and conviction, with it's complex layered arrangment, and extreme dynamics.With state of the art eclecticism and shameless hippie-chick optimism and you get a record that isn't predictable and will challenge your musical boundaries. As Nelly herself cries out on the end of Hey Man:""Cause I don't want Ambivalence, no no."""
4,Give Her the Grammy Now!,"I had a sneaking suspicion that the entire CD might be good based on the single, ""I'm Like A Bird"". Boy, sometimes it's good to be right! I've been playing it non-stop since picking it up yesterday and I hope the rest of the world picks it up soon!"
4,Not Britney,"This is female pop with talent...not mass market radio crap, just a chick with feeling...recommended!"
3,"Shows promise, not the masterpiece I read about.","Don't get me wrong this cd has some great songs but after reading the reviews I expected much more. The first half of the cd is much stronger than the second half as well. The songs are very similar sounding and she really is not doing anything all that earth shattering that we have not heard elsewhere.Now with that said, there are 5 or 6 very good songs that grab you and you cannot help but want to dance to. The latin mix is a nice touch too as well as the very 80's sound. Her voice is very plain however and could use some work."
2,unhappy,"I purchased this as a gift a month before giving it to the person. It was too big for wife's fingers. Contacted merchant, but they said it was past return period. Will not buy from again. Gave two stars because it was as described."
4,Pretty Darned Good,"This pan lived up to its billing in all but one respect -- I don't think you could quite get a 3lb meatloaf into the thing, 2lbs or 2-1/4lbs maybe. Other than that nitpic though, the design works well for draining away the grease as you cook (especially important if you mix in any ground pork or sausage as some recipes call for). The non-stick surfaces make cleanup pretty easy too."
4,"Great Quality, Wish It Was Bigger","The quality is obvious when you get it. What is left in the bottom of the pan after a meatloaf will make you really happy with your purchase. I also agree with the first reviewer in that you might want to find a way to make your meatloaf recipe and bit more 'wet' by adding water, whatever.My only complaint is that a 2 lb meatloaf will barely fit in the pan and I've had spills in the oven.I'm a happy camper but I look forward to version 2.0 as well."
2,Grease doesn't drain as well as hoped,"Unfortunately, most of the holes in the top pan are blocked by the meatloaf and can't drain at all, and there isn't much of a gap at the ends between it and the bottom pan for grease to drain that way, so it clogs easily and builds up. I usually pull out the pan halfway through cooking, clear away the built up material, and put it back in.Another pan I had from a different manufacturer with a slightly different design had the same problems, however, so it seems they all suffer from this.The top pan is also a pain to clean because meat gets trapped in the holes."
3,Typical LTD,"I like this CD for the same reasons Mr. Grindle dislikes it - the ballads. Apart from ""Back in Love Again"", LTD's uptempo songs could have been canned. I'm an avid fan of LTD for such songs as ""Concentrate on You"", ""Love Ballad"", ""We Both Deserve Each Other's Love"" and ""(Won't Cha) Stay With Me"". Shine On was an album with which I waited patiently to be reissued on CD. Jeffrey Osborne's voice and phrasing are tailor-made for romantic ballads, and are wonderfully showcased on the little known song ""Lovers Everywhere"", featured on this CD. The ballads on this CD lends it its value. Also, I take issue with Mr. Grindle categorizing the ballads as pop as Osborne's style in delivering them is consistent with authentic soul tradition. For fans of LTD's romantic music, I strongly recommend Shine On as it offers some well-known tracks along with some lesser known gems."
4,Osborne's Last,"You know upon hearing it 'Shine On' has the same flaw as every LTD release it seems-too little funk and too much smarmy pop balladeering,and for lovers of the latter this album is FULL of that slow jam stuff.But up the tempo and this album COOKS!!!""You Gave Me Love"",""Getaway"" and the fabulous closer ""Don't Cha Know"" are all fabulous funk tunes with great songs attached too!But like alot of LTD they just don't sustain funkiness for a whole album.I think a 2 CD compilation of JUST their funk tunes is in order-just too many boring album tracks that are way overrated!"
5,Millions of Americans are sickening from the food they eat,"Millions of Americans are sickening from the food they eat, last year 5,000 died, and obesity and diet-related diseases are on the rise: so Christopher Cook's examination of the food industry in America in Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us provides much food for thought. Cook is an investigative journalist whose probe of the food industry's perils is backed with facts and well-honed research. Food lies at the root of many epidemics and poor social and economic conditions. Cook not only pinpoints the problems, but argues for a new way of looking at what and how we eat which places sustainably produced foods within reach of the public. Diet For A Dead Planet is informed and informative reading."
5,Diet for a Dead Planet,"A well written and informative review of the current food situation.Well researched and presented, and easy to read.Chock full of facts, and the varied, related food topics are sure to grab a reader.Resources at the end of the book guide you to organizations and sources thatfurther your education."
5,Primevil fan for life,"I enjoyed the series on TV, so much I bought the DVD. Now I can enjoy whenever,where ever I want. So much Excitement and the DVD quality is great."
4,A decent tv show,"Primeval is a pretty decent tv show. It will probably never be a classic, but you could do a lot worse.The acting isn`t great, but better than you find on most tv shows these days. The writers are not bad either. Not great, but atleast the stories and plots are entertaining and (mostly) make sense. That in itself sets this show apart from most of the glopon modern tv. The special effects are pretty good for a tv show, but with decent stories and plots the show doesn`t have todepend on them. A good story will always beat flash/bang special effects any day of the week. But a good dose of both doesn`t hurt."
3,meh,"Handsome Male Lead: Danny Quinn, you are doing it wrong.Sorry, but Primeval without Stephen was bad enough, but Primeval without Nick? No, not cool. Very much not cool. We stuck around until the cliffhanger end, the very annoying cliffhanger ending since the show has been cancelled and will possibly be sold to America to be completely re-done, but once Dougie was no longer the loveable Nick Cutter the show took a very large nose dive. If you already like Primeval, you're going to pick this up regardless, but new people, be warned: this show has a habit of killing the people you love, or even like, and it certainly doesn't stop in this season. Not by a long shot."
4,"Cheesy, but addictive!","This is the cheesiest, silliest, most idiotic show. I cannot stop watching it! If you're looking for a classic, this isn't it. If you're looking for somewhat interesting sci fi with great actors, you've found it."
4,Season 3 review,The quality of the production is excellent and the special effects are amazing. They have continued to improve each season. The story and plot lines are great. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole season and am looking forward to the next.
4,Primeval series is great,"My son is 6 and saw a preview for the 1st season of Primeval. He wanted it so bad that he earned many happy points for us to buy it. After watching every episode many, many times. He was elated for the 2nd season. (we didn't even make him earn this one) Everyone in our family has watched Primeval--including grandparents and haved enjoyed every minute of the mystery and the creatures!"
3,Disappointing,Season one was great. This was a let down - main characters killed off and with all the creatures they could have come up with - a fungus that turns people into a giant mushroom? A dragon-like creature supposedly a dinosaur that I have never seen in any dinosaur book.What a let down!
2,What happened to this show is criminal,Having really loved the first boxed set and waited eagerly for the next season i was totally crushed at the direction the show took.I don't want to get into spoilers but it is a radically different show.New cast addition Danny Quinn is very annoying and how they added him to the show was silly.Anyways i really hated most of it.RIP primeval.
3,"Primeval..full of ""What ifs""...","This series is full of ""what if"" ths could really happen! The actors and actresses have rapport together as if they were all privately good friends...it doesn't always happen that way in TV series. I look forward to each adventure as they are all a variety of incidents.....beware if you don't have a fun imagination, you would not like Primeval. Enjoy.."
1,Super Jumbo cot failure,"First time I used the cot on my camping trip the middle leg supports buckled and bent upward, I sat down on the cot to lay down and the leg gave way. I was laying on the floor of my tent. I purchased the cot because it had a heavy duty rating of over 500 pounds. I weigh about 420 pounds and this should have been just fine. I am very disatisfied with this item."
1,Cheap knockoff,"I totally agree with the other reviewer that this cot is way overrated. It's made with cheap, way too thin, materials. The center rod down the middle is because without it, this cot would sway back and forth even worse than it already does. Plus it's too tall so getting on and off is way uncomfortable on the underside of your thighs. Traded it in for the TETON Sports version. Spend $15 more and get that because it has nothing but great reviews and it's well worth it. As the old saying goes . . . ""you get what you pay for."" Sorry Ledmark, but you missed the mark on this one."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,I have used this burner repeatedly and have had no trouble.My computer is getting old and i did not want to spend a lot of money.When I buy a new computer it will already have a burner installed.I have already told my friend he can have this one.I am very satisfied with this product.
4,Easy but Tedious,"I love this mix, although you have to remember to put the B complex in 5 minutes later. I love the results and haven't had happier corals. Complete complex for a beginners tank, loved the easy application and indications. Super easy for beginners."
4,"Fascinating, if a bit out of date","First published in 1979, Carol Ann Rinzler's ""Dictionary of Medical Folklore"" provides a nearly complete collection of our medical myths, beliefs, and delusions, from acne to zinc oxide. Often, they are fascinating. For instance, most people have read a mystery in which a corpse's nails keep growing after death; according to Rinzler, that's absolutely false: the cuticles shrink, making the nails merely look longer. I was also pleased to learn that chocolate does not cause acne, which would have made my adolescence a little less argumentative. There are a few items that have become outdated as medical research rolls on, but on the whole, this is a worthwhile book to have in your library, to help answer trivia questions or do research for stories."
3,Nikon prostaff,The Item I ordered and the item I recieved was not the same item...Becareful and review your order very well or youll have to box it back up and send it back!!The scope is fine though.. it just doesnt have the angled eye piece..
3,It's light and works well sometimes,"It's light and works well with my Leica. However, if you have any flash head with a little weight the swivel doesn't hold its locked position as you rotate the unit to take a portrait photo. While in taking landscape pictures it works fine. The swivel works on a ball pin system and cannot hold any useful stress or weight. They need to build in some sort of a locking mechanism into the unit. I have to use tape, not good. Thanks"
5,"Incredible song, incredible singer","I first saw Womack and Womack's ""Teardrops"" CD on the BA flight from London to Washington years ago and for years tried to track it down. I thought the song title was something like Footsteps on the Dance Floor or something like that. Amazingly, that was something like 1988 to 1990. I couldn't keep my eyes off the lead singer, Linda Womack. She was incredible, beautiful, slender. What a woman. Its now 2007 and tonight I just found the video on iTunes. I bought it and what a great, upbeat, positive song. The Womack and Womack story also seems a great one and I now wonder where in Africa they live. I would love to say hello some time. Cecil? Linda? you out there?"
4,One of the very best albums of the 1980s.,"Although it went mostly unnoticed at the time of its release, ""Conscience""was one very fine R&B; album that deserved far greater exposure and success. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves classic Soul. This is some of the best post-1985 R&B; music you could find anywhere."
3,Great songs,20 years or so on Teardrops is still a great song. Heard a remake of it on the radio this morning which is far off the quality of the original.
3,Returned this product,"I returned the above product because it was torn and they were great. No hassles, they returned my money without any problems. I would do business with this company again.New York Yankees Black Logo Tire Cover"
2,Useless book,I have a hard time finding anything useful for Busines Development or good practices for Government marketing in this book.
2,I loved OGs earlier stuff...but,this is crap compared to their last. Where's the emotion? The passion the intensity? This album is extremely predictable and way to overproduced for my taste. Nothing special about them here.
2,Vanity Press,"Mildly entertaining, but overpriced. The authors don't seem to have credentials as critics, writers, or theorists - but this is more of a hobby book. I also couldn't figure out which press published this book. Could this be a vanity press? If you want everything LOST, OK for a collection - but not as a primary source of insight or criticism about the show."
1,Thanks For The Tip-Off,"Glad I read these before I ordered and wasted my money. I hate typos in a published piece; it's a slap in the face to the reader, totally illiterate and irresponsible of the publisher.KT"
1,Will Nack be in the third season?,"I am an avid fan of the show, and anyone who needs a guide might better stick to the reality tv shows, in my opinion that is half the fun of the show (formulating your own conclusions and catching the subtexts and subtlties on your own or with friends. But as a collector and die hard fan it is nice to own and collect these things. I browsed through this at a friends and was compelled to see what other people had to say about the typos. I am buying a different one (not just because I also LOATHE bad spelling and silly, careless editing...maybe you should write ""Unofficial guides"" for ""The Bachelor"" or ""Survivor""...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PEOPLE."
5,must have,"This is the book that will help you get thru to LOST Season 3 - decent book. ""Sawyerisms"" were funny - had a good laugh. Chapter on numbers quite interesting."
1,"this is clearly the ""other"" book","I just finished reading this book (as well as Unlocking the Meaning of LOST), and I tend to agree with the other reviewer who gave this book one star. This book has a lot of humorous and entertaining facts about the show, but it doesn't really make you think about the show in new ways. One of the great things about LOST is the way it invites viewers to create meanings of their own as they watch. From visiting a couple of the fan sites for the show, I know that most of the fans for LOST are incredibly intelligent, creative people who want a read that will stimulate their thinking about the characters in the show, the meanings of the ""ancestor texts"" in the show, etc. And for me, this book here just didn't cut it. I think it's pretty cool that the show is generating so much interest now in books about the show, but if I had to choose only one book, I'd pick Porter and Lavery's book. In my opinion, it is the better read, while this book here is clearly the ""other"" book."
1,Did Someone Actually Edit This Book?,"Honestly, I have never seen so many typos in a book. Some sentences are almost incomprehensible (unless you want to spent the time figuring out which letters are missing or tacked onto the wrong word). Incorrect character names are aplenty. The authors and editors of this book should be ashamed! Did they read this book before they sent it to the printer? Huge print, double spaced - this book is actually about 100 pages, not 300. And all this at $24.95. This is so obviously a ruse to make money by piggybacking off the success of this show. Spent your money wisely - buy ""The Lost Chronicles : The Official Companion Book"" - a far superior book."
1,Waste of Money!!!,"For the price this book is a huge waste of money. It seems like it was rushed out with no regard to all the errors, disorginization, etc, in the book. It's just a rehash of commonsense and information that is readily available on the internet for free."
4,Cute gift for my husband,"My husband is an accountant so we always joke that he is not exactly Mr. Fix It around the house. This was a hilarious and cute gift for his birthday. We have not truthfully read it yet, but it sure looks fun on the coffee table."
2,Too dumb even for dummies,"I was disappointed in this one. A lot of fluff, not enough ""how to."" I much prefer my old Sunset ""Home Repair Handbook"", but there doesn't seem to be a current version available. I guess the best way to learn about fixing anything these days is just to look online. Google ""how to ..."" and you'll get much better advice than you'll find in this book."
2,fix-it book,"I love the 'for dummies' and 'for idiots' series of books, but have found that they can be hit or miss. Some contain a wealth of information, but I have found some - like this book-contain pretty basic, generic information. I am not even a homeowner, but a sgl apartment dweller, who likes to at least KNOW how to fix things myself. VERY little info of any use to me in this particular book, but will still ck out the 'Home Improvement' book in this series, & maybe that one will be more helpful to me."
5,This is a wonderful activity book for my students.,"I teach an ESL advanced grammar class at St. Charles Community College. These activities tend to take about 40 minutes or so and are entertaining for the students. I love that it gets them talking. Sometimes it gets pretty lively!This and the other book by George Rooks on conversations are gems! I've had to update some of the activities for modern times, so it would be nice to have a third edition (maybe there is one!) but I would really recommend this book for intermediate-advanced students. They really enjoy it!"
1,"Great Editorials not so ""great""","Aside from the editorials included, the writing is dry and often convoluted. The briefs on the historical periods during which these editorials were written could be improved with a little clarity on the author's part.Though this book was compiled in 1997, women are absent from this collection. Thus, this book perpetuates a subtle stereotype that women have worked for years to destroy: that ""greatness"" can only be achieved by or associated with men.Look to this book for a one-sided interpretation of editorial writers and history."
4,Outstanding resource,"Author Roughton's book is remarkably clear and concise, affording a comprehensive perspective on the context and content of an effective safety culture.Those interested in creating such a culture will understand that the emphasis on safety must become an integral part of the organization from top management to the operating worker. This book describes the path to that end, as opposed to simply describing a tool to be used and set aside."
2,Green Sunrise Doormat -- blah,It was not as eye-catching as I thought. I have it sitting out on my deck instead of in front of my door for neighbors to view.
4,Fun book!,My 16 month old nephew loves this book! The illustrations are bright and colorful and he loves to lift the flaps.
3,"Love the book, Just not toddler proof.","My son loves balls, so I thought this book would be perfect. While I like the book, the flaps are flimsy and guessing they will be ripped off very soon. However, I did read the reviews before purchasing, so I did know about that. Regardless, my toddler likes the book."
3,Elmo dropped the ball,Many parents have little Elmo lovers in their home and they know that that child loves everything Elmo. This book may be one of the first Elmo items they don't love. The story is rather dull and for a baby to toddler there are so many different kinds of balls that it is hard to explain what they are if you have an inquisitive toddler! Plus the flaps didn't seem to last very long.
4,Decent book for Elmo lovers,"We've learned the names of all the balls with this book. It's a good one with a ""door"" to open on each page. Not too busy and a good quick read."
5,"Balls, Balls, and more Balls","One of my grandson's first words was ""ball"" and then ""backet ball"" (basket ball). If it is round, rolls, and hopefully bounces, he loves it!! I bought this book for him for this Christmas and although he hasn't seen it yet, I know he is going to love it, especially because of the flaps that he can lift! Great book!! (For all ages)."
2,Only so-so,"This book is ""all right""...but I much prefer ""The Inflammation Syndrome, by Jack Challem, which came out first. Both books cover much the same material, but I think The Inflammation Syndrome does a better job of connecting the dots between dietary imbalances (caused by eating too many junk foods) and inflammation. It also recommends a very clear anti-inflammation diet plan, with easy to follow guidelines and recipes, as well as a number of well-documented anti-inflammatory supplements, such as the omega-3 fish oils, gamma-linolenic acid, antioxidant vitamins, and B vitamins. In addition to describing the big picture of inflammation, The Inflammation Syndrome also focuses on the top 20 or so inflammatory diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and arthritis, as well as inflammatory athletic injuries -- each with specific recommendations for eating habits and supplements. At the very least, you might consider getting both books and synthesizing their advice to suit your needs."
4,Helped me!,"I used info gained in this book to help me with my fibromyalgia pain. It has really worked, to my surprise. I am thankful to the author."
5,The best non-stick pans out there!,"I've purchased and tried them all, and these beat everyone of the nonstick pans out there. They are heavy duty, never warping under the direct heat of the broiler, and clean up in a breeze with a little soap and water. I cooked everything on them from steak to cookies and everything cooks perfectly. The best part about them is that even though they are dark, cookies don't burn on the bottom like they do with most dark pans. They will probably last a life time. I like them so much, I started buying them as gifts."
2,Don't Believe Everything you Read,"Dr. Ide should be given credit for his very easy-to-understand writing style. However, if you're looking for a fair and balanced portrait of Bush, you won't find it here. I was disappointed that Dr. Ide was apparently unable to look past his political views. What a pity he should conduct what seems to be very expansive research but chooses to litter his writing with personal sentiments. As an Independent, I picked up this book hoping to learn more about Bush, but realized its design was to ""add fuel to the fire"" of those who already dislike him."
4,Arthur and the Invisibles - Double Sequel,"This double-feature continues the story of the original very well. The spunk of the Princess is missing from the second movie, but then she is a prisoner of Maltazar. But have no fear, it returns in full in the third movie. -- All the characters are there and share great adventures to the completion of the story."
3,Hubbell Photocell outdoor timer,Shadows cause blinking so it is difficult to place anywhere it's not seen. Also would like an 8-hr. setting. Works well except for those two issues.
2,A poor imitation of greater works,"I got two things from this novel; That the author likes A) France, and B) Anonymity. The narrator never emerges, but chronicles the activities of the protagonist beautifully. And that's the crux of the problem. Greene's (IMHO much better) novel, The Quiet American, did not allow for neutrality or pacivity on the part of the characters, or the reader. Just's novel allows for a certain level of detatchment that does not fit. This novel never surfaces any issues in any way that makes the reader question what they'd have done differently. And this detatchment is far too safe for the subject matter."
2,Not quite there,"There were some interesting aspects to this book, most especially the decision by the author to focus on the early days of the Vietnam War--a topic not discussed nearly enough. That being said, I nonetheless felt that the characters and storyline were underdeveloped. He could have gone so much deeper with this. I never felt I fully understood the characters, that is the deeper complexities undoubtedly harbored being in such a unique situation. In fact, I could not believe it when I realized I had only 50 pages left to read. It seemed like the story was just beginning to develop."
3,eye shadow,This said it was wet/dry but when I tried to wet it didn't work so used it dry. Didn't come with applicator so quess you're supposed to use your finger or use you're own. Just okay product.
5,IRRESISTIBLE,I HAVE THIS IN CASSETTE FORM THIS IS A VERY GOOD ALBUM I REALLY ENJOY IT. I STILL PLAY IT TODAY. I REALLY ENJOY THE TRACK NEXTTIME. THE ONE CALLED SLOW DANCE IS MY FAVORITE. IT'S WORTH YOUR MONEY.

4,A Book That You Will Never Forget by a 14 year old reader,"Even though it is a good book it is sad.There is a clue to the end dury the book.Its not a funny book but you will never forget it,or the charaters.You will want to read it again and again.If you don't like depressing books you might or might not enjoy this one but I would take the chance."
3,Terabithia,Jess was a good runner. He was the fastest runner in the fifth grade. He was the only boy in his family. He had four sisters. His music teacher was his favorite teacher. Leslie got to run with the boys and won every race she competed in. Garry who was the bully did not want her to race because she is a girl. The boys picked on Leslie because she did not have a TV. Janice Avery was a tough girl. She took May Belle&#65533;s twinkies. Jess and Leslies played a trick on her. Janice Avery was in the bathroom crying about her dad beating her. Leslie went in and became her friend. One day Mrs. Edmunds asked Jess if he wanted to go to an art museum with her. When Jess got home Leslie was dead and his mother thought he was to.
4,Still a favorite,In the fifth grade my class read this together and we absolutely loved it. Especially the creation of Terrabithia and the dog Prince and the mention of Narnia. My friend and I went on to create our own world where we were princessess. Older elementary children will love this book.
4,good book!,"This story begins with Jess trying to become the fastest runner in school. Then life changes when Lesley Burke moves in next door. Lesley is the fastest runner, not Jesse. They become friends anyway. Jesse and Leslie have fun,exciting and scary moments together. This is a good book full of friendship, a little adventure and sadness. The book ends with a horrible tragedy..... I recommend this book because it has many different themes and the characters are interesting. D.E."
3,Express,"This book has something that i like. and it was the attitude of the main character Jesss. He was a good boy his only goal was run. Tyhe book didnt have a secuence and thats why i gave it a 3 stars cause i have never read a book wich i can give 5 stars. The story was too sad at the end and nobody wait that, maybe it could be a better story if the end would be different."
4,A story of remarkable richness and depth,"Katherine, Paterson's Bridges to Terabithia, is about an odd situation that brings two young people together as inseperable friends. With both of their good imaginations, they create their own magical kingdom. This book is a good book for any type of reader. In particular, I would recommend this to young teens because it's a very heart-warming story, about friendship."
3,"Not the best book, but its okay.","Bridge To Terabithia was not the best book, but it was okay. I like to run and this book involves running which I thought was pretty cool, but the ending was mixed up and confusing. Basicly, it had a strong begining but an extremly weak middle and end. Its kind of weird to. Otherwise, its all right. I do not reccomend this book."
1,"Some Say It's Good and, Sad, but it's Just Bad","This was a horrible book. In 5th grade I had to read this book for a lit study, and boy that was enough. The book's plot is so idiotic, and NOT SAD just stupid. I can't tell you the plot though, because that will give away the ending, but I can't do that. This book will also never have the word isn't in it just the word ain't. I know it's good to have good voice in the story, but it over uses it. It would be different if it was in 1st person, but is in third, and they all talk like hillbillies. If the story took place in a swamp in Louisiana that would be different, but it doesn't, plus it's in the 1970's when the English was more developed. Please do me a favor, and don't read it. Okay?"
1,Disappointing,"Just a quick review here folks, since there are 546 other people who reviewed it before me... what is the big deal about this book? Why has it endured, why have teachers been assigning it since I was a little kid? There are SO many better written books about friendship and loss, or whatever the ""lesson"" is supposed to be here. I got to the end of the book and said ""that's IT?"" You know what it reminded me of was that movie with Macauley Culkin, ""My Girl"" ... he and Anna Chlumsky have this budding friendship and then, before they've even had a chance to delve into the relationship, he's dead. I expected more from that movie, and much more from this book."
1,THERE'S NO POINT TO THIS BOOK!!!!!!,"Dear Reader, my 6th grade class and I had to read this book. I almost died of boredom. Some people love this book(like old people), but i would know i love books.If you looking for a GREAT book then read the House of the Scorpion or Tuck Everlasting!!!!!"
4,This book shows how hard life can get.,"This book is about a boy named Jess who really wants to be the fastest runner in his grade this year. In school he likes drawing when he is bored, but he has no one to look at the drawings except for his music teacher, Ms. Edmunds. His neighbors' house just sold and a family moved in. A girl in his grade now lives there. Her name is Leslie. Jess and Leslie become very good friends and start doing everything together. Jess and Leslie make a little house in the forest by the stream, they called it Terabethia. They get across the stream on a rope. One day Ms. Edmunds asks if Jess can go to the museum with her. Jess goes but forgets to ask Leslie if she wants to go. That little mistake turned in to a big loss in the end."
5,First Tears,"In fourth grade, I read this book. I was in the highest reading level group, and we all waited in suspense together for the next page. This was also the first book that brought tears to my eyes. My friends and I still remark on that day we sat around the table, and learned of Leslie's death."
5,"Movie Tale of Friendship, Loss and Recovery","This story is simply yet beautifully told, and contains powerful messags about friendship, imagination, loss and recovery. Jesse Aarons, age 10, practices hard to become the fastest runner in the fifth grade. His hopes are dashed when Leslie Burke arrives in the neighborhood. Recovering from disappointment, Jesse decides that Leslie is OK, given that she never gloats. The two develop a strong friendship connected to their imaginary kingdom of Terabithia in the woods. In Terabithia Jesse and Leslie reign as king and queen, sharing stories and dreams, and finding solace from a difficult world. When Leslie tragically dies, Jesse must contend with the overwhelming loss, and in time he finds a way to do so.This superb story saddens and inspires, and is sometimes read by persons grieving the loss of loved ones. This is a popular children's story, but it connects with readers of all ages."
5,great read,"I read this book aloud to my 10 year old. The book was chosen by his ""book group"" at school. Easy to read, good, smooth storyline, true life. At the end of the book, it was so sad, that I could not finish reading it aloud. Told my son he would have to read it to himself, because I was crying...."
4,GREAT BOOK,THIS WAS AN AWESOME BOOK.I NEVER GET SO INTO BOOKS AND NEVER WANT TO STOP READING A BOOK.THAT'S JUST NOT MY PERSONAILTY.I GOT INTO THIS BOOK SO WELL AND ONLY BECAUSE OF A STUPID BOOK REPOT I HAD TO DO FOR .....READING CLASS AND I'M HAPPY I DID READ THIS BOOK.I THINK IT;S ALMOST ONE OF FAVORITE BOOKS EVER!!!!I THINK YOU SHOULD READ IT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY AND IF YOU HAVE I HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT AS MUCH AS I DID!!!
4,The Bridge To Terabithia,"Bridge to TerabithiaThis book was very interesting to me. It was a good book. The happy part of this book to me was when Jess & Leslie first met, & they had become friends. They had a great relationship as friends. They cared for each other very much.So they made "" Terabithia"". The sad part for me is when Leslie dies, because she was the closest friend Jess had. They were best friends & had a great relationship, and then all of a sudden, she's gone. I know it was very hard for Jess. He probably had plans with her like letting her author books and he illustrated them.I think this book was for anyone who likes adventure and wants to know how it feels to lose a friend so bad, then their just gone. Anyone who wants to read a book can read it, even when someone else thinks different. When you read you explore and one day you could be a book writer yourself."
3,Terabithia,"Bridge to Terabithia is about a young boy named Jess and a new student named Leslie. They made an imaginary land named Terabithia. Terabithia is a place where they can go and be away from the normal world. The only way that they could get over to Terabithia, was to swing across an old rope that is suspended across a small stream. Jess and Leslie would cross the bridge every day and made a visit to their make-believe world. One day there was a huge storm. Jess and Leslie tried to cross the old rope. This one day would change their lives forever. This book was okay. It was just not detailed enough. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes carried out stories. This book wasn't one of the best books that I've read, but it was pretty interesting."
4,Centralia's 6th grade Review,This is a great book for all kids to read. It is a story of friendship and imagination. We liked this book because it kept our class' attention and we didn't want to stop reading it until the end. We recommend that you read this book if you want to be entertained and amazed. It is better then the movie because you get to make up your own idea of what Terabithia looks like. In the movie you only get to see what the movie makers imagination is.
4,Don't wait to discover this classic,"I was a sensitive kid (I hated watching Road Runner and Trix commercials because of the unfairness of it all). I played with a pack of little boys, and I knew the worst thing that could happen to a person was for someone to see you cry. When friends were reading Bridge to Terabithia and reporting it as a sad, sad story, but very, very good, I ran away from it as hard as I could. We even played Terabithia in the woods together and I pretended not to mind not knowing the back story. Now I wish I hadn't waited 30 years to read this book. There's pain here, true, but also beauty and the hidden memory of what it was like to be 10 years old. I would recommend this book to anyone, even those who always wanted to give a cartoon rabbit a long-in-coming bowl of breakfast cereal."
5,The Bridge to Terabithia,Good story line. Well written. Such real human feelings all around. The Bridge to Terabithia makes you revisit yourchildhood with better understanding.
5,bridge to terabithia,I enjoyed this book very much and decided to get it for my 11 yr old grandson. He enjoyed it also.
4,Bridge To Terabithia,"This book is about a boy & a girl. At first, they don't get along. Then, they build a magical kingdom. They teach a bully a lesson. They also learn lots of lessons. The boy's name is Jess. The girl's name is Leslie. The name of the magical kingdom is Terabithia. Read this book to find out what happens next."
3,Book Ruined,Sadly this book was runined for me after the ending was spoiled in a class I was taking. But this is a book that may serve a purpose in helping a child deal with friendship and loss. I hope that my statements haven't ruined this book for somebody else. Also I wanted to comment that because the books was spoiled for me I may have rated it lower than I might have otherwise.
4,One of the best books ever.,"This story takes place right outside Washington DC in farm country around 1960. This book is about a boy named Jessie Oliver Aarons Jr., his four terribly anoying sisters, his nagging mother, and his busy father. Jessie plans to be the fastest runner in the fourth and fifth grades. One day a girl named Leslie Burke moves in next door in the old Perkins place. She & Jessie become best friends. They went & built a magical kingdom called Terabithia. I'll reccomend this book to anyone who likes to imagine."
3,Good Book Sad ending,"This was a beautifull book, with one problem, the end. I won't ruin it, but all i will say is WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THE AUTHOR THINKING, it was tooooo depressing. I enjoyed the simple beauty of the land of Terabithia and the imagination it took them to create it, but the ending was just way way way way way way too sad."
5,great read,I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone. Its a story that will capture your heart and take you on a wild journey through your imagination.
3,"Decent, with some big problems","This was a decent book. I think anyone would be moved by it, but I have been moved more by other books. The biggest problems are that the boy does not react realistically to his friend's death, and that the writer seems to bash fat people over and over and over. Every fat person in this book is ragged on, made fun of, etc. Why????"
2,Bridge To Terabithia review,"Bridge To TerabithiaJesse Oliver Aarrons,Jr. and Leslie Burke are friends who made a kingdom called Teribthia. First, Leslie lead Jesse to a creek with a rope. Leslie started to swing across, so Jesse followed. When the kids enter Terabithia they get powers like to run very fast and to grab tree branches high in the sky.Do Jesse and Leslie keep their kingdom a secret? No, because Jesse's little sister Maybelle, knows about the kingdom. Every day Maybelle would ask,""Can I go to Terabithia?"" and they both would reply,""NO!""Bridge to Terabithia is a great story! Some parts in the story are similar to the movie.But otherwise it is a great story. My partner in my Lit. Circle group says"",It is a sad story, but the author usesmalot of creativity and imagination,"" I think the author uses alot of adventerous things also.If you want an adentrous,imaginary,creative book, Bridge to Terabithia is the story for you!"
5,"Eloquent, moving and timeless","This story was read to me in the 4th grade. I fell in love with the language, imagery and the narrative and I must have read the book about 18 times. I am now a teacher and recently bought another copy to re-read and to see if it was appropriate for my grades of reluctantly reading gang bangers and such. The story affected me as deep if not deeper than it did when I was 8. This book is a must read for voracious readers as well as reluctant ones. Please disregard the hypersensive reviews of the paranoid religious right that I have just viewed. It is simply ridiculous that they have anything else to say about this book other than the fact that it is a timeless story, & an effortless, absorbing book you'll want to read over and over again."
3,A Great Friendship,"Have you ever wanted a good friend? If you answered ""yes"", then you should read Bridge to Terabithia. This interesting and exciting book about friendship will teach you about love, determination, and loss. Jess Aarons wants to be the fastest runner in the fifth grade, but when his new neighbor, Leslie Burke, comes to school the challenge is even harder for him. Even though Jess didn't become the fastest runner, he found a new friend in Leslie. Jess and Leslie also found a magical place in the woods that they called Terabithia. It was a private place just for them. Jess likes to draw, he's a good friend, and he's nice. Jess has two older sisters. They're lazy, selfish, whiney, and bossy. Jess also has a younger sister named Maybelle. She follows him everywhere like a cute little puppy, but he draws the line when it comes to Terabithia. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes great books about friendship."
5,Andrew's review,"Bridge to Terabithia, by Katherine Patterson is about two kids named Jess and Leslie. Jess and Leslie do everything together. They build a secret place in the woods called Terabithia. Leslie had never been to church before so she went to church with Jess and his family. They spent every day together. Jess helped Leslie and her family fix up their house. At school they even played a joke on the school bully, Janice Avery. One day Jess went off and spent the day with his music teacher, Ms. Edmonds. When he got back he found out that something bad had happened. Bridge to Terabithia was interesting to me because Jess and Leslie had to keep Terabithia to themselves and not tell any one about it. It made me think about my secret hiding place that I go to when I am upset about something or just want to think."
5,Great,This book came in a timely manner. It came in a better condition than I expected it to come in. It is a wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone!
5,Awesome!!!!! =),"This book is awesome! My teacher read this book and she had tears in her eyes on the part when Leslie died, and jesse was running to Terabithia"
4,Bridge to Terabithia,I have recently read the beautiful novel Bridge to Terabithia. What an amazing children's book. I highly recommend this book for the young adult reader. The two main characters Jess and Leslie form a close friendship with the usual ups and downs of school children. Both children come from different backgrounds but are drawn together. This friendship strenghtens into a beautiful relationship and a closeness between to children you don't often read about these days. Tragedy strikes and young Jess experiences one of the most painful aspects of life and begins his journey into growing up. The subject covered in the story may be heavy for some children so it would be a nice book to read together. Be prepared for tears and have a box of tissues handy. It's a great book for families to discuss some sensitive issues in life.
4,"A wonderful, but sad story.","The Bridge to Terabithia is a wonderful, but sad story. The Bridge to Terabithia takes place outside of Washington D.C in the 1960's. This story is about a boy named Jess Arons Jr. He has a mean mother, four sisters, as well as a dad who is hardly around. A girl named Leslie moves next door to Jess. They become best friends and find a hide out that no one knows about. They name it Terabithia. When a tragic thing happens, it could cange Jess's life. I highly recamend this wonderful, but sad book!"
3,The Bridge to Terabithia,"I think the Bridge to Terabithia was a sad, but at the same time joyful. The book's setting is Washington D.C. around the 1960s. The book is about Jessy Oliver Aarons Jr. and he meets Leslie Burke in their overcrowded, prejudice, stinking school. They become friends. They feel out of place so they create a magical country called Terabithia. They become king and queen of Terabithia. Terabithia will bring them so many sorrows and joys. Who knows what will happen to them in Terabithia..."
4,Well written book about everlasting friendship,"The Bridge to Terabithia, a story of everlasting friendship, takes place in farm country outside of Washington D.C. during the 1960's. The main charaters are Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke. Jess lives in a house surrounded by four pestering sisters, a mother who doesn't understand him and, a father who's hardly home. Leslie moves into the farm next to Jess and the two become friends. Together they build the kingdom ""Terabithia"" that's totally sceret. When a terrible incident happens, will their friendship end or begin?"
4,Lorin's Bridge to Terabithia Review,"A young boy named Jess Aarons,is in the fifth grade,works his hardest to be the fastest runner. Suddenly, a new girl moves in the Perkin's place and turns out to be the fastest runner out of the fifth grade. His dream was now OVER! At first, Jess was upset that Leslie had beat him in the race, but they soon became good friends. Jess told himself that being friends with Leslie wasn't so bad.After Leslie and Jess spent a little time together, they built a secret retreat called Terabithia. Jess became the king, Leslie became the queen, and P.T. was Prince of Terabithia. One day when Jess was in Washington with Mrs. Edmunds, a tragic thing happened, Leslie was dead! His mom and dad gave him the bad news when he got home. Jess was saddened! she was killed by swinging on the ropes they always swung on to get to Terabithia.Jess made a wreath in honor of Leslie and also built a bridge to Terabithia.This was a great book, and I loved it! So will you!"
5,Swing into this book!,"The book Bridge to Terabithia is about a kid who is in the fourth grade. He thinks he is the fastest kid in the school. Until a girl moves in next door. The girl beats him in a race. They eventually became friends and made up a place in the woods called Tarreibthea and to get in it they have to swing in on a rope. They start hanging out and become boyfriend and girlfriend. I liked this book because it shows how close you have to keep your friends near. The lesson is for every action there is an opposite but equal reaction. Meaning, in every good but bad action, it may seem good for you but hurt you in the end. To learn more about this book go to your local libary and pick up this book. You probably wont want to put it down until the end the very end."
4,Amy's Review,"This book was about a young girl and boy who meet and become best friends, and eventually fall in love with each other. I read a book that was similar to this one and I loved it to, it was the same scenario, but they had known each other all their lives and didn't really have an intimate relationship, I mean like boyfriend and girlfriend, they were just really good friends. I myself really liked it and I would have to say it's my favorite book ever. I was suprised because most books don't interest me to the point that I can't put it down and that I was excited to get a chance to read more of it. The end was very shocking and sad, I cried. I think this book is only for the people tha t like sad books like me, and its sort of a love story,. so if you like that kind od thing this book is for you, I highly recommend it to anyone, and I hope you like it as much as I did."
5,I Couldn't Stop Reading,"Bridge to Terabithia was so good I couldn't stop reading. On and on I read, it was such a good book. Even though it was a school progect to read it, I loved it."
3,OK,"..The Bridge to Terabithia This is a comical, butheavy-hearted story. This story takes place in a farmland rightoutside of Washington D.C. during the 1960s. Ten year old Jesse AAronsis stuck with livings in an unstable house. One day a city girl(LeslieBurke) moves into the old farm house next door. They begin to start awonderful friendship. They make up a dream world called Terabithiawhere no one can boss them around"
3,How i dis-liked the book,"This book ""Bridge to Terrabithia"" was an o-k book. being a 13 year old in New York, i thought the book was a little boring. The best part was the ending, and i hate books where you have to wait all the way to the end to get an exciting part. But it had a great story about a true solid and excellent friendship between 2 main characters.I think that this book is a good book but like i said if i could change it i would definetly change the sequence of events. I think the author did an excellent job in describing this book, but didn't emphasize in the thoughts of the reader.Yet this book was a little boring, it was inspirational, and a great childrens book. I would DEFINETLY recomend it to other people *OF ALL AGES* so please go to your library and take out this book!"
2,Not that good,"There are some things I like about this story and those are that she has runners in her story which I like to do, theres a bully in this story, the only book I've read with a bully in it, the way she organizis it . Sometimes at recess I read about kids racing on foot, that is something I like to do, but I mostly like challenges of anything. This is a very interesting story because theres a bully in it. The last thing I like about this story is the way she organizis the chapters and I also like the names of the characters.Somethings I don't like are that Jesse and Leslie both have a big imagination together, and that Jesse has two annoying sisters which I hate little annoying sisters plus theres something I don't understand because I don't remember reading about a bridge.I recomend for kids to read this book for education and that this book doesn't have enough violence, I give it two stars."
5,Terabithia,This book was one of the best books I have ever read. It's about this boy who at the bigging is basically focused on being the fastest runner in the 5th grade. When one morning while he was outside running a girl walked up to the fence and he ends up becoming friends with her. They build a mystical castle that they call Terabithia and there way to get to it is through swinging over a rope tide to a limb. Also another part of the story is were they find the school bully in the bathroom crying over her telling her friends that her dad beats her and they told the whole school.
4,Bridge to Terabithia,I think that it was a great book but it was kind of sad at the end and was more like a sixth grade book. Even though it was kind of hard to read I am glad that I read it because one theme is about dealing with death.Tdog 5th grade
3,Bridge to Terabithia Reveiw,Katherine Paterson wrote a novel called Bridge to Therabithia.The two maincharectors are Jess Olivar Aron and Leslie Burk. The genre of the book is ( the type of book) is realistic fiction.During this book Jess and Lesslie become good friends. In the wood the two build a small castleand have many adventers together.

4,Bridge to Terabithia-Katherina Paterson,"In the book Bridge to Terabithia,Jess Aarons and Lestlie Burke are the two main characters.Jess is a boy that dreams of being the fastest runner in the fifth grade,he has been training for it all summer.Things arn't so good for Jess at his house or at school,his mother and father act like they don't care about him ocasionaly,and at school he doesn,t have any friends and nobody likes him,until Lestlie came to school.Lestlie has a big imagination and is very brave.this story takes place in 1970 in a small town in Virginia.The genre of this story is ""realistic fiction"" so if you don't like that kind of book,you won't like this book.This story is about two friends that are happy together ,until something bad happens.I realy like this book, I definatly recomend this book."
3,Bridge to Teribithia,In the book (Bridge to Teribithia) which was written by Katheren Patterson. A boy named Jess Arons who wishes to be the fastest runner in 5th grade.That changes for him and everyone else. A tomboy named Lislie beats everyonein the school and becoms Jess's best friend. Leslie and Jess make a magical kingdom of Teribithia. All that changes after a bad problem.This great book is in VA 1970 on a farm. The genre is Realistic fiction.I think the book was great. I liked The rope swing. I would like it better if it wasent so sad.
4,Sensitive and realistic.,"My Brisbane Year 8 class and I enjoyed this book. Most of my students read it from cover to cover. They thought it was sad and very realistic. I enjoyed the fact that so many social issues are raised in the course of the book. It is an enjoyable read and contains some great, descriptive passages."
1,Don't read this book,Although I didn't like this book there were still some interesting parts to it. One thing I liked about this book is that the auther made good converstions between Jesse and Leslie.Another thing I liked about this book is that the auther gave Jese and Leslie such good imaginations.Jese and Leslie made an imaginative land called Terabithia.The story line was also great.There are also somethigs I didn't like about this book. One thing I didn't like about this book is the tragedy that occurs .It just caught me off gard.I also didn't like the sisters in the book because they anoyed me and got in the way all of the time.Another thing I didn'd like about the book was that I didn't like how the auther lacked diskriptivenis in the characters in the book.I highly do not recomend this book to anybody . A reason I don't recomend this book to anyone because its not deskriptive and the sisters are allways in the way.
1,Who wants to read a depressing book?,"Some people think that this book has meaning. Some people think that this book has a powerful message. Well, maybe it does, but it's also a depressing book. Who wants to read about a kid who has a terrible life? Some say that reading about people who have problems helps you to deal with your own problems. Maybe that works for some people, but it sure doesn't work for me! I like to read books that don't make me cry. And I don't mean by that that I will read only books that make me happy. That's not true. Some books can tell you about people who have it hard off without throwing it in your face. ""Bridge to Terabithia"" may touch some people, but it sure didn't touch me."
1,Very Poor,It's hard to understand why people think this book is wonderful. I couldn't even finish it. The swearing was very distracting. It was even sometimes quite boring. I do not recommend this book at all.
1,ultra bad book!!!!!!!!!!,"Bridge to Terabithia is a realistic fiction by Katherine Paterson. The setting is in Virginia in the 70s. The main characters are Jesse and Leslie. Jesse is a boy who is trying to be the fastest kid in 5th grade. Leslie is a girl who just moved next to Jesse from Arlington and wants to be Jesse's friend. Those were the main characters. The plot is about a boy who wants to be the fastest runner in 5th and he meets this girl and becomes friends with them. Together they create the magical land of Terabithia. When faces a tradegy he relizes the strength Leslie had given him. This is indeed a boring book!I would not recamend this book. Personally I like books with action and funkey names and this book does not have an ounce of it! The only thing good about this book is that there is alot of forshadowing. I didn't like how everyone talked like country bumpkins, even that theyr'e living in Virginia. I think you should not think about buying this book ever agian."
1,Horrible book,"This book was horrible. I wish I could give this book NO stars. How anybody can enjoy this book is beyond me. The music teacher was a good influence, but the book was awful. This book is grossely overrated. I highly recommend that you don't read this book."
1,DON'T READ THIS!!!!!,"I had to read this book for school. I read it in one sitting. It was a waste of my time. Do not read this unless you enjoy a book about a tomboy falling in love with a farmer boy. Also the movie looks worse than the book. If you need something to read then read Splinter Cell, or MAD magazine."
2,A Very Boring Book,"This book is so much boring then I expected. I had to read this book for school and the teachers always pick out bad books. This book is about friendship if u r into that kind to thing, but i didn't enjoy it all that much. I found the charactors very annyoing and boring people and the story seamed unreal. I don't believe a teacher would spend a day with u and take u to Washington D.C. I really didn't like this book but If u think u might go for it. I hope this review helped."
1,bridge to unneedd sorrow,"This book should not be required reading. It does not portray a realistic relationship or fort building experience and the tragic ending is pointless and stupid and in the end the boy blows it off and goes on.. The dealing with bullies is not even close to reality either... I am missing something here.If you want a real adventure book or classic read ""The Adventures of Huck. Finn"" or some other Classic, why waste our kids time on this stuff.This comes from a womans point of view and maybe that is why women enjoy it. But growing up a boy I can say this is not how boys think and build forts. And kids do not slip off ropes and such as the boy suggests too often. ""I agree"" says my 10 yr old daughter"
1,WORST BOOK EVER!,This book is terrible! All my friends and I hate it. Sometimes for a whole chapter it talks about Jess thinking about things that nobody cares about. This would never happen in real life. All they do is say wow im in happyland. No wonder they dont have any other friends. LESLIE DIED! LETS HAVE A PARTY!
5,great book!,Absolutely love this book. Sometimes we need to forget about the adult novels and read a feel good book geared for all ages. This is one of those. I would recommend it to adults who want a good book to read with out all the sex and violence of so many adult books.
5,Delightful Newbery Winner,"A Newbery Winner discussing the friendship of a boy and a girl who create an imaginary world of knights and ladies. All is well until tragedy strikes. This book is required reading for our 6th grade classes in school. A wonderful book dealing with coping with loss. A recommended read for all children.Evelyn Horan - teacher/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book OneJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book Two"
5,A wonderful book,"As a middle school teacher, I plan to read this book as a class novel. I loved it and your kids will too!"
5,bridge to terabithia,"A twelve year old boy lived in the country with his mother, dad, and three sisters. He had no life and the only thing enjoyable was was going to the woods. untill oneday a girl moved into the house across the field. They loved to go to the woods and play, one day they built a play house for them to go and talk. to get there they had to cross a ditch, by a rope tied to a tree limb.one day leslie was going to the tree house to think she sliped on a stick and hit her head on a rock.so leslie's parents moved back to where they came from. jesse built a bridge to that place that laslie called terabithia. that is how hey got the title of this book.you have to read this book it is marvalous!"
5,My favorite book ever!,"I first read this book years ago. But it's so good I still pick it up and read it again every once in a while. It is a sad story, but it is uplifting! Highly recomened!"
5,Excellent Book,"I saw the movie before I read the book, which is too bad, really. Amazing children's book, though. Definitely should be required reading for 8+"
5,Required reading,"I don't remember reading this book as a kid, but when my son was assigned the book, I read it too. What a great read! Sure, it's sad, but the emotion is so honest and the book is so real - I felt it did a great job of capturing a child's view of death as well as of friendship."
4,Terabithia,"This book takes you swinging across a creak to an imaginary country called Terabithia where Jess and Leslie rule as King and Queen with Prince Terrien(Leslie's puppy). Along with ruling this country, they also have to deal with giants who not only threaten their country but in other ways their lives. Although their battles were not against real giants, they did have to face bullies. This book shares the life of two kids living in the country as well as how devistating it is to loose your best friend. This is a wonderful book that can be read by children of all ages."
3,Bridge To Terabithia Is An Okay Book-LSMS,"To me this book is an okay book, it gets boring at some parts and then exciting at others. At the end its sad to because of Leslie dieing, and it could also help kids relate to this story of their past life. I think it gives kids of a well knowing of what could happen next and not to ever regret something. But their could be many sides of this story also. It does use the lords name in vain, but i believe that ever child will eventually hear it once in their life, and its just teaching them. Overall i think this story has a good moral and is appropiate for children to read."
5,The Bridge to Terabithia,I thought it was a very very very good book.I think it is one of the best books I ever read.But it is extreamly sad.My favorite part was when Jess gives Leslie P.T..This is a book everyone should read.
5,great book...,i read this book when i was in 6th grade and i still rember much of it...it was and i still beleav a good book...i am the only one in my class that thinks its a good book but who cares i know what a good book is and this is a good book...
4,"""The Best Book I've Read""","I think the book is great.However, I do not like the way the author wrote the end.I think she should have ended the book by Leslie moving because more kids will face that problem in their lives than death of others their age.The characters were fascinating, they looked and talked like the people in that setting normally does.The dialogue is serious because they speak like most people in that rural area do.In the pine grove the characters speak solemnly and the dialogue is taken very seriously.The climax happened near the end but the events building up to it was other things that teenage kids do so the events were not boring and the climax was exciting and that made me want to finish the book.I dont know what others think but i like that book beginning to the end and would recommend this book to anyone. A Student From Princeton High School"
4,You Have to Read This Book,I loved this book because it had times of joy and times of saddness times of fear too. At some point of the book it put mein too shock. In the book one of the charcters (Jesse) has too facehis fears of water too hellp a little sister.i dis liked the book because of bad word choice witch isn't a big deal. Som times it seems boring but it can lead too big desasters.Ido recomend this book to you. Why? because it's just a good book for adventur and action. This book makes you sit on the edge of you'r seat.
4,Unfair plotting used to create sympathy for abused child,"While the lesson of the fragility of life is vital, the two families unfairly portray the situation as a result of differing parenting styles. While Jesse has a rough life, victimized by family circumstance and exploited by others, Leslie is an abused child. What happens to her should have been investigated as a crime by her parents and by the community. It is not always the poor family who fails to provide for their children. Read the book and decide for yourself. Minor characters are well drawn. The leisurely pace of the first half belies the page turner. This is standard fare for disaster flicks such as Titanic, but uncommon in childre;s literature. My 7 year old daughter cried uncontrollably, but agreed that her demise was a result of bad parenting."
4,Good Book,I thought this was a good book. I liked the whole thing. The only part I didn't really like was the end.
5,Wonderful book! It will definately stick with you!,"This book was read to me by my fourth grade teacher, and has stuck out in my mind ever since. Of all the books I've read for class assignments and for pleasure, this book is one I'd recommend to people of all ages. It tells the story of an everlasting friendship, even to the point of death. Although the two friends have completely different tastes and personalities, they learn to stick together through thick and thin. You must read this book!!!!!!"
5,It was a great book.,"Bridge to Terabithia is an extrodinary but sad story in the 1960's outside Wshington D.C. It is about Jesse Oliver Arrons Jr. and Leslie Burke. It is about Jesse who is totaly surrounded by girls has a naggy mother, and a father who is always at work. One day Leslie moves next door and they become best friends, and do a lot of stuff together. If you like books about true friendship read this book."
3,BEAUTIFUL,"This tragic but lovely story takes place in the 1960's outside of Washington D.C.on a farm. Jess Aarons is a ten year-old boy who's lonely although he lives with four annoying sisters, a terribly mean mother, and a father who's hardly ever home. One day a city girl named Leslie Burk moves into the old and dirty farm next door. Leslie and Jess together build a city called Terabithia where know one boses them around. What will happen next the answer is to read this lovely book."
4,"""Suspenseful""","The Bridge to Terabithia is an adventurous and creative storywhich takes place in the 1960's in a rural community outside ofWashington, D.C. Jess Aarons, a ten year old boy, is very lonely in afamily with four sisters, a grumpy mother, and a father who is hardlyever around. One day a city girl named Leslie Burke moves into thefarm house next door. To Jess's surprise he and Leslie becomeremarkably good friends. Jess and Leslie build a magic kingdom calledTerabithia, where they can go to get away fom their troubles andworries. Only when a tragic loss greatly affects Jess, will he knowhow mch Leslie has given him."
4,A fine book for every body,"I like this book. It's sad and happy. It was a fine book. I suggest this book for other readers. This book is about a boy named Jess and a girl named Leslie. They like each other, but one day she dies."
3,good book - per 5th grader as dictated to her mother,"I read this book for my 5th grade assignment. The book was good but not as good as others I have read. This is a story that begins with a boy, Jess, who after his chores of milking the cows, sets out to run across the farm fields. It ends with him coping with a tragic loss of a friend by building a bridge. A bridge to a Terabithia, a magical land, he shared with his friend. Whereas, the characters seem real enough, the story does not capture one's imagination. It dwells on the sad side of life. The inability of these two kids to make friends easily with others and their need to escape their lives into a world of imagination. Imagination is wonderfully fun but how sad that they need to use it to escape."
2,READ THIS REVIEW,The book bridge to terabithia was a book that was good in many ways. It realy describes the characters very carefuly and thurely. It also has a great way to show u exactly how the chareters act and feel.The auther uses events that might happen in real life.This book had a few good moments but the rest was a little bbbbbboring! I thought the poeple rushed the endings and the book was toooooo long . But if u like long books u would probably like it. At the end of the book a tradity acures but later in this novel they foreshawdo this horrific event.I do not recommend this book to poeple that do not like long books or rushing books.
2,What was this book about?,"I did not understand why this book was written. What was it all about? The only point it seemed to make was Leslie's death at the end of the book. Overall I thought that it was exteremly uneventful. Terabithia seemed to have a small role to play in the book. 'Much ado about nothing' fits this novel.I cannot, however, ginve this book only one star. Giving it one star would be hating this book. I did not hate it I just thought that it never did get to the point. If it was a memior I would have liked it. As a memior I would have thought it was a good book because I would have expected this. (I wouldn't have picked it up though. Memior isn't quite my style.) I liked the characters and was sad when that girl died. I think that that is why I haven't given it one star.Not a ringing endorsement, but if memior is what you like I'd give it a shot.-cdm"
1,Terabithia Reveiw,"I did not really care for this book but some good things about it are how the characters made Terabithia a magical imaginary place and one of the main character's personality. There are a lot of things in this book which could have been better like the one main character that narrates has a very shallow personality, the tragedy in the end is just to sad, and it just did not grab my attention. I would not recommend this book to you but you may enjoy it anyways."
2,Excessive swearing,"Our daughter and her friend, who are reading the book Bridge to Terabithia in their grade 5 class, commented on the swear words in the book. As parents, we read the book and were appalled that the Lord's name was taken in vain 34 times, the word d*** was used 4 times, and the words h*** and h***hole used 2 times. We do not believe that this is appropriate for any grade and especially not for grade 5's. The story is interesting, but there is no need for cursing."
1,Bridge to Terabithia,"I read this book and I find it to be boring. Just when it was getting good someone has to die. Personally, I don't like reading books like that, at all. I was required to read it as a school project and I think it was a waste of my time. It had all sorts of pointless text and events in it. Like when Jesse just decides to punch his little sister in the face, for no reason. And when he is milking the cow and he uses the utter like a gun and squirts his girlfriend in the ear with fresh milk. If I had time I would type more but I don't, and I'm lazy. I would rate this book half a star if I could. Unfortunately it's not an option. I would recommend this book for people who like reading books about nothing. Thank you and good night..."
2,Horible,When i finished this book I thought it was horrible. In the begging katheran Paterson focuses on running and nothing else. there is a tear jearker but that is the only oince. Warning this book is horrible
3,In Poor Taste,This book offers a great story...a good read for sure. I am however very disappointed with the authors choice to use curse words in the book. The audience for this book ranges from 3rd graders and up. I do not see any need for an intelligent person to have to incorporate ignorant curse words into a children's story. This alone soured the read for me. In poor taste...
1,It really put me to sleep,"Ugh! I did NOT like this one. It was really boring, and in my opinion it didn't really have a point. I would have never even thought about reading it, except last year my teacher made me. OK, the ending was kinda sad, but for the most part, I wanted to just space out while it was being read. Not that I'm too young-- when I'm 18 I'll STILL think it's boring!"
1,Shocking in a very bad way!,"I wish I could give this book no stars! I was shocked at the profanity in God's name and even the profanity not in God's name since this is a fifth-graders book. The characters, especially Jesse's family, were so hateable I can't say I liked a single one. And the whole magical land thing, these kids should get lives. It was not realistic at all. Leslie died at the end of the book when she drowned in a stream during a storm. She would have to be really really really stupid to try and get to Teribithia that way during a storm. This book should be called ""Bridge to Terrible-ia"". I read this in fifth grade and I'll be sorry I did forever."
2,Bored.,"... I was very bored throughout it.The character development was far too slow, and the story didn't have a whole lot of point..."
1,bridge to terabithia,"I bough a new, but a receive a used book. I'm really dessapoinment. Plese be honest with the customer. My book have marks, it's suppost new"
5,my favorite book of all time,"read it about 7 times now, at different points in my life- it's amazing the way a book can touch you"
4,Hope,"I learned of ""bridge to terabithia"", that if you have a object you need to make it no matter what hapens , like Jess doit he try to figth for the first place in all the 5th grade but leslie his friend wuz more faster that him , so he didnt get mad at her becouse her wuz his friend and he just keep going with practice and in that book shoow you that the friendchip its berry important becouse no matter if leslie wans in the race they wuz still friends with out figths and things like that , so i think that ""Bridge to terabithia"" its an important book."
5,Touched,"The book Bridge to Terabithia is actually a required textbook for our school's English Literature courses. But in a way, the story of Bridge to Terabithia has given me much more than knowledge.It is touching to see the way Leslie's friendship changed Jesse's life. The impact of friendship was so well illustrated and well expressed that readers can't help but be touched.Katherine Paterson also discussed many in depth topics very subtly in Bridge to Terabithia, such as friendship, death, family relations and so on and so forth, bringing the readers forth to understand the characters more and more deeply. In a way, readers can actually FEEL themselves in the character's shoes, especially in the last few chapters where Jesse experienced the different stages of griefing for Leslie's death.To conclude, I feel that Bridge to Terabithia is a rather exceptional book, and because I can really relate to it, I have only positive thoughts to say about it."
3,This book is a ok book,"Book Review By:Christina TolsonThe Bridge to TerabithiaThe Bridge to Terabithia is a sad but inspiring story. Jess Aarons' is stranlded in a house with a naggy mom, adad who is never there , and his four sisters JoyceAnn,MayBelle, Elie, and brenda. The setting takes place outside of Washigtion, D.C. in a farm areaaround the 1960's . One day a city girl named Leslie Burke moves nextdoor to Jess Aarons'. Then Leslie Burke and Jess Aarons ' became best friends. They were inseperable. Leslie and Jess made up there own magical world Terabithia. Will Leslie and Jess hold there friendship ? This was a falblous story!!!"
5,Beautifuly written!,"I loved this book! Jesse and Leslie are best friends, and whenever they cross the river they escape into a the magical world called Terabithia. The book has a terribly sad ending though..."
2,too depressing for me,"I found this book to be very depressing. Jess Aaron's parents are horrible parents and his sisters are the same, except for Mae Belle. The only uplifting point in this book is when he meets Leslie Burk, but that also ends tragically. I do not believe that the author did enough foreshadowing for the awful event that happens near the end of the book. It was a total shock! She could have done a better job warning the reader ahead of time, especially because this is a children's book. One of the main reasons that children read is for pleasure, and there is nothing pleasurable about this book. The tone was extremely sad throughout most of the book. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I like Katherine Paterson as an author and it is well written, but I really think she has many other better books out there. This book was too depressing for me to read. I prefer something a little bit more uplifting when I read."
3,Not a true children's book,"This is not a book I would read over and over agian. It is a well written story but sad, very sad. My husband read it in 4th grade and didn't care for it and I just recently at the age of 29 read it, I cried. I couldn't believe the ending, I wish I had stopped in the middle of the book. If you want a true touching tear jerker, you've got it in this book. Do not read if you want a happy childrens book."
1,"Basically, this book is disgusting.","I'm an eighth grader and in fifth grade my teacher read this to us. It was SO boring. I hate stories about idiot kids who make up fake places and think they're real. Or fake people or things, etc. It was a HORRIBLE book. I had no interest in it and every day when it was time to read I got SO upset because I did NOT want to read it! It was a HUGE waste of time. The only reason my class liked it is because there are some swear words in it and we thought it was funny to hear our teacher swear. Honestly, I don't know why we had to read it and why the teachers keep making us read it. Even if there is a good message. If the kids aren't interested in a book they won't retain it and won't understand the message. We kept reading it just so we'd know it would be over eventually. Among the other books I had to read in school that I hated: Maniac Magee, True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, Tuck Everlasting, and MAROO OF THE WINTER CAVES! They were all disgustingly bad."
3,Bridge to Terabithia Review,"This book is about a young boy who is in the fifth grade that wants to be the fastest boy in the fourth and fifth grade. There school gets a new student whos name is Leslie. At first she is not accepted at the school but Jess Aarons becomes friends with her. They build a secret city together in which they call Terabithia. In the book a great tradgedy happens which upsets the whole school and community, Leslie dies. Jess is very upset and he makes a grave where she died. He feels a little better because when her parents leave they give some of her belongings. I enjoyed this book very much and I hope that you will too."
3,Bridge to Terabithia,"I think that this book was good but it had a very sad ending.I rated this book a 3 because the ending was soooo sad. My mom cried really hard. It has a very desriptive vocabulary. This book is a very good book for learning vocabulary. It has a very meaninful title. You may not understand it at the beginning ,but you will understand it later on in the book.J DOOGY-DOG"
3,Plain and Sad,I give this three stars. The writing I thought was very good. Overall the story itself was well written but in the end it just got sad. I think it did jump around a bit and too many characters were used throughout the story that didn't move the story along very well. I also kept waiting for something great to happen but nothing did. It was a story about average kids growing up in a small town and then a sad ending. There was no major problem to solve and the fantasy element was simple imagination. Overall it was good and I recommend reading it just don't get your hopes up that this is epic. The movie I think was better than the book in this case.
2,"If you have it, sell it.","I am a fifth grade student from Waldron Mercy Academy (MG)This book is a real stinker. I was forced to read it so I did not have a choice. This book is about a boy,Jess who lives in the farm land that ran all summer to become the fastest kid in the 5 grade. Until he meets a girl that beats all the boys in the race. Surprisingly they become great friends. Life was going his way untill a accident happens. I hated it. I rather be hung by my eyelids than reading it again."
1,AWFUL,"I wish I could give this no stars. It was boring, and d*** and h*** were used too many times. How could someone give this 5 stars? Never read this book!"
1,review,"one of the things i liked was that close to the end it surprises you.I also liked how there was alot of characters. for example may belle,ellie,brenda,jesse,and so on.another thing i liked was at the end it dosen't leave you hanging.it was kind of boring.also there was not enough main chacters.it was an ok book.if you have nothing else to do it is a good book.or if you want tospend time."
2,This book was terrible!!,"I had to read this book 4 school & I was kinda excited 2 read it, cuz every body raved on & on how good, how sad it was. I would never recomend this book. If your thinking of reading this book, don't. You'll be happy u didn't, trust me.~Atalanta"
1,Very Depressing!,I had to read this book for school. At first I liked it but I was shocked later on at the profanity. When I reached the end of the book I was very upset. If you don't like reading about death and poverty don't read this book.
4,SHORT AND INTERESTING,BRIDGE TO TERIBITHIA WAS A GREAT BOOK I ENJOYED IT ALOT. I THINK ITS A GREAT BOOK TO READ TO IS PROBABLY 5th GRADE. THIS BOOK IS A FUN AND EXCITING BOOK TO READ. THIS BOOK IS ALSO A READY TO GET TO READING CLASS BOOK.I ALSO THINK KIDS CAN RELATE TO THIS BOOK. I THINK THIS BOOK SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO READ BECAUSE IT IS A FABULOUS BOOK!
4,Bridge To Terabithia,"In the novel Bridge toTerabithia the two main charecters, Jesse Oliver Aarons and Leslie Burke make a magical kingdom called Terabithia. This story takes place in a small town in Virginia near Millsburg. The genre(type of book) is realistic fiction. In the novel Jesse shows the five signs of denial when tragedy strikes.I think this is a very good novel. There are things I like and things I dislike. A thing I like is the lesson that they give you, it is things happen and you have to go on with life. A thing I dislike is the cussing. I would recommend this novel for everybody."
4,Jess and Leslie`s secert hide away.,"Bridge to Terabithia is good book for ages 10-13. This is a heart beating,edge of your sit story. I could can kind of see myself as this character in this book.I would suggest you read this book."
3,bridge to terabithia,"I like how Jess has a cruch on Miss.Edmends, I think its cute. The two older sisters are mean but the younger sister worship Jess.I dont like how the kids make fun of Leslie beacause thats rude. Janice Avery gets on my nerve she is so mean. Like when she stole somthing that wasnt hers.Jess needs to get a new friend that's a boy.Because if he finds a friend thatis a boy then he won't have to think about Leslie.Get rid of Terabithia and distroy it so he dosen't have any memories about it.This is a great book , read it."
4,WOW,"Bridge to Teribithia is a wonderful book.It's fun characters make this book seem real! The thing I loved about it was the setting of the story. The image in my mind was spectacular. One character really made me laugh,it was the school bullie. Her attitude was terrible picture every thing gone bad,and there you have it THE BULLY !!!Out of the whole book I have only found one thing I'm not found of. That is how quick the tradgic accident occured. The accident just didn't fit the story quite right. That one part will have you all twisted up inside.I would highly reccomend this story because of it's well done characters. Plus not only you get a wonderful story, you get the true meaning of friend ship. READ IT NOW!!!!!!!CHLOE"
4,Terabithia review,There is a whole bunch of well done things in this book. one of the things is Lesslie moves in to the old perkins place. At school they have a running commpition. Who will be the fastest runner in the fifth grade. The two main characters make a hideout in the forest. Those aren't all of the good things in this book.Here are some bad things about. There is a serious tragidiy that happens. Lesslies family moves away to a different city and state. Jess takes a trip one morning and leaves Lesslie behind. Those are all the bad things I can think of.I would recomend this to a friend because it teaches you friendship. If I were you I would get this book.[...]
4,Teribithia,"The parts I liked about this book Bridge to Teribithia is partally the twists. There are twists after twists. For instance when a main charector goes somewhere with a teacher and comes home to A tragity and it makes you think why. I also like that the whole book is real. From bullies to tragitys.The book is also quite funny. Like whrn two main charcters try to get back at a bully.Although the book is a good book there are a few parts I didn't like. For instance when the tragity happens it brught back memories from when the same tragity happned to my best friend.I also didn't like the part where Jess hits his little sister, because if you're like me you can feel her pain. Thoes are the only things I didn't like.So in a way I both recomend and don't recomend this book. If youlike sad thragities and happy endings you will like this book, but if you don'tlike those things you most likly won't like Bridge to Teribithia."
3,A very touching book,This book is very touching and very emotional towards the end. The book reminds me of my little 9 year old sister because she always imagines that she is in her own little world. She pretends that she is in a spaceship like Jess and Leslie were pretending they were in a magical kingdom. I would recommend this book for other kids because of the way it shows friendship and you can learn to be careful what you wish for. It might be harder for young kids to understand.
5,Water Under the Bridge.,"Whae we first started reading this book,I thought it was going to be a little kid's book and not a good story. The story is about a boy named Jesse who gets up every morning and runs. One morning he met a girl named Leslie, he and she became best friends .On a rainy Sunday morning his music teacher came and picked him up and they went to the museum, he forgot to tell Leslie where he was going and that he would not be able to meet her. When he comes home, his parents tell him that she is dead and that she died trying to get over the water to get to Terribethia My favorite part is the praying ceromonies they have and how they dress in flowers. I liked the ending because it ended right if she would't have died then it would not have been such a sad story. I liked this story and I think you should read it."
3,good book,i really enjoyed this book. it sounded like it was a childrens book but as the book got more intense the books vocabulary got harder and harder.this story is touching and shows good friendship between 2 new friends and the problems one another go through and how they solve it.The book was a simple book to read realy no problems at all thats y i recomend it to almost all levels 4-above.
4,Children's Lit. Student,"The Bridge to Terabithia is a story about two children that have unseeingly wild imaginations. Two children that wouldn't typically have became friends if it wasn't for the girl, Leslie, and her storytelling ability that sucks the boy, Jessie, right into to her world of fantasy and fiction. Tucked away inside their world of imagination, fantasy, and magic lye a mysterious land where anything can happen. SPOILER ALERT: The passing of Leslie couldn't have come at a worse time for Jessie and for anyone who has lost someone close to them knows how he feels. This story is very relatable to children. Children who read this story can read about Jessie's struggle with losing a close friend but is able to derive courage and a stronger sense of self from it all in the end."
5,awesome book so far!!!,i am reading this book and it is awesome its fun and creative i wouldent recomend this for children under 9 because it has some bad words. but so far its great!!!!
4,"To create a new world, you need imagination.","Jesse's sad, miserable, bored with his life. Until the new girl, Leslie, comes to town. This girl is different, she runs with the boys, wears funky clothes and doesn't own a television! Leslie and him don't fit in. They become friends and together create a world called Terabithia where he and Leslie overcome problems in their imaginary world and our own. Read this book to find out how Leslie and his world falls apart when an untimely accident occurs.My favorite part is when Leslie and Jesse help others and themselves overcome problems.This book was very good, because it teaches readers to appreciate the people around them.I would like to recommend this book to kids that love imaginary worlds and have suffered losses."
3,Good,This book helps to teach young people about tragety and the loss of life. This is a very difficult topic to talk about and to teach young people to deal with these types of situations. This book not only entertains but helps to introduce young people to the harsh reality of death and loss of a loved one. This book also teaches that not all stories are full of happy times just as in the real world unforseen events take place and we must learn to deal with our feelings on this things. I used this book in my 5th grade classroom and it was a great success.
4,A True Classic,"Bridge to Terabithia is a novel that is worthy to be called a classic. The novel focuses on Jess, Leslie, and their kingdom, Terabithia. The friendship between the two is unique because of the encouragement they give each other. The creation of Terabithia gives the two an outlet to be creative in, as well as allowing Jess to be king and Leslie to be queen.Adults enjoy this book due to the nostalgia that affects them, yet children enjoy this book because they are able to relate to the characters and their lives. As a teacher, I am amazed by the new perspective that I notice each time I read this book. What also amazes me is the students' reactions as they read Bridge to Terabithia. Since they are able to relate to this novel, they beg to continue reading because they are so affected with the characters. Their glowing response to this book makes this novel a must read and have for your own personal library."
4,Bridge to Terabethia,I only give this a 8 because it wasn't really interesting. It only got interesting when the new girl moves in. Jesse makes friends with the new girl and they make a make believe world. They pretend they are the queen and king of Terabithia.Then something happens and Jesse is left all alone. I won't tell you what happens next.
4,WOW,The name of the book I choose is Bridge to Terabithia. The author of the book is Katherine Paterson. I choose this book because it is good. There are a lot of surprising moments too. Like the end of the book is very surprising. My favorite part of the story is when Jesse gives Leslie P.T (Prince Terrian). I would recommend this to a friend because I think it is good and a lot of other things but maybe some of my friends might not like the book Bridge to Terabithia.
3,TERIBITHA,In the begging of the book Jess meets a girl named Leslie.Jess was the fastest runner in the fithgrade.In the middle of book they invent Teribitha. Jesse and Leslie go to Terabithia across a gulley on a rope. At the end Jesse tells May Belle about Terabithia. My favorite part is when Leslie tells about the gaint killers. In one part it is sad.
4,A READ AGAIN BOOK!,"Bridge to Teribithia is a wonderful book! It's a book about a girl and a boy who become best friends and build a special place where only they can go to think and relax!It's a place called Teribithia! We should all have a place like Teribithia! It also shows you how important friendship is, and that you should take everything seriously otherwise before you know it, you may lose your best friend! I read this book in 4th grade and I thought it was great! Then, in 7th grade I found it and decided to read it again! Even the second time the book was wonderful! I hope that you liked my review, and I hope you really consider reading this book!"
2,Wonderful Writing...Bad Message,"I have read this. I have read many books. Written many stories. I'm a student in high school, and I still remember crying over this book when in grade five. It was so beautiful. Such strong friendship in this book...but then, like everything else it was lost. I believe the presence and way DEATH is portrayed is very wrong in this book. Death, as always, is portrayed with such strength and power, while hopes and dreams are shattered. I do not think a child should read this. It sends the message that nothing is real in the end, for death takes everything away. If you believe children should 'learn' about death then let your child read this book, but if you like to teach your child that hope and love truly exist in life then I do not suggest this book. (It is, however, written very well, and praise for Katherine's writing skills!)"
3,The Bridge to Taerbitha,This was a awesome book . I have a great heart . To this Bookwas great-Trinity straddled
3,It was ok,"This story less than impressed me. It was ok, well written, and can be a useful tool to teach about grief."
4,Learning to let go...,"Bridge to Terabithia was a great book. Everyone needs a friend. That I do know. Jess has never been friends with a girl. Especially one who is faster than him. So much for being the fastest runner in the fifth grade. That was Jess's greatest ambition. Leslie and Jess gradually learn to trust and respect each other. Together they create Terabithia, their own magical kingdom where they rule. Terabithia is so much different than the real world. Terabithia is wonderful and flawless. Then, suddenly, a great tragedy sweeps over this unbroken friendship. Jess will never be the same.I recommend this book to readers of all ages, especially to those who like books about friendship and loss. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed."
5,"SCARY Reviews, Outstanding book","The number of low-star reviews is astounding. And I can't even begin to comment on the folks who are actually counting occurrences of the word ""damn"". (I'm still reeling from THAT revelation.)This book was a birthday gift somewhere in the vicinity of my 12th birthday, and it is the one of the few books (from youth) I've kept into my adult life.Paterson weaves great intricacy into her characters. Themes like insecurity, loneliness, and peer rivalry in the pre-teen realm are articulately revealed. It speaks about loyalty and friendship, even in unlikely circumstances. The tragic aspect gives the story timeless depth.My edition features elegant blank ink watercolor illustrations-a great complement to the text.It's unfortunate that this lovely book has been elevated by educators to ""must-read"" status. That apparently is the kiss of death from a young reader's perspective."
5,Friends Forever,"I thougt that the book Bridge To Terabithia is a very good book.It is about two ten year olds that meet in a very strange twist.One of the friends is scared of many things while the other is bold and courageous!Their friendship teaches both of them something and opens their eyes.One is granted courage and imagination the other is granted a friend.After the creation of Terabitha, a magical kingdom each experiances the greatest times of their lives, no rules,no one to tell them what to do,FREE!I liked the way Patterson used the third person point of view. Also she chose my favorite genre,realistic fiction.My favorite charecter was Jess,he was neat.I can really relate to this story because when I was young a kid moved in beside me and changed me!!! 10 out of 10"
3,Oddly Entertaining,"Imagine an Eighties update on a Forties ""women's picture"". . . but with Laura Petrie or Mary Richards as the long-suffering heroine. . .and Sam (Ted Danson) Malone as the cheating spouse!Mary Tyler Moore is spunkily stalwart as the wronged wife but wise-cracking Christine Lahti steals the picture as the other woman. (Guess Valerie Harper was busy.) Plays like a jazzercise-era remake of the old Bette Davis/Mary Astor tear-jerker ""The Great Lie."" Movie never makes up its mind whether it's a comedy or a drama but is oddly entertaining nevertheless."
5,Sweet Movie!!,"I loved this movie! I'm only 12, but I thought it was so sweet! Ms. Moore went from Laura Petrie/Mary Richards image, to Beth Jarret, then back to Laura. I thought it was so mean of the husband to cheat on such a sweet, loyal, and devoted lady. The only thing about this movie was that Holly (Mary Tyler Moore) looked so much older than her husband in the movie!!! Was she supposed to be younger than she actually was? Mary Tyler Moore is my favorite actress, so maybe that is why I like this movie, but I really did think it was so cute!!! And in the end...(sorry if this spoils it) does Harry go with Holly? It doesn't make it clear...not to me anyhow."
4,"Finally, an accurate portrayal of grief . . .","A wonderful study in the dynamics of grief, love, friendship, and betrayal. (Keep a tissue handy.) At times, predictable, yet rings very true."
4,Good chick flick,I enjoyed it.Explores the issue of loyalty and infidelity and the impact on a friendship.
4,Listen to 'ambient' before there was such a thing,"Art of Noise scored some brief MTV airplay off this album in the mid-80's, then quickly faded away from America's music charts. That is unfortunate, as this album is one of the first of its kind. An amazing blend of true 'ambient' sounds (trucks, tractors, radio broadcasts) and electronica, Art of Noise was years ahead of the acid jazz and house music that we all take for granted in the 90's.Any fan of electronic music should check this out. Very relaxing at times, complex, and singular in its originality."
2,"Don't buy it for ""Moments in Love""","My only experience with the Art of Noise has been the fabulous ""Moments in Love"" that I heard on the radio. The cut in this album is not the same, and not nearly as good. The rest of the album was just, well.... noisy. I was disappointed, and won't try them again!"
4,Laughing and liking,"When I first heard this music I thought of laughing my brains out. It was really funny with all those weird sounds. But when one starts listening to this music more often with a more open mind, you start getting the deeper feeling of it. Although it has its flaws and still always gets me in a good mood when driving to work because of the funny sounds, it is a very deep and lovable album. Not the best I've heard, but still well worth the purchase!"
4,Art Of Noise Is Art Of A Different Kind,"This album is years ahead of its time. Even though released in 1984, it is a type of music that some people I think are not ready for. It works for me, however. It contains a lot of clever music beats, sound effects, looping tricks, and synth effects that are just downright catchy! Excellent."
3,More for the avant-garde,"The version of ""Moments in Love"" that you hear on the radio (and was really popular about 8 years ago) was released in 1989 on a ""Best of..."" CD that's no longer available. It's a remix of the shorter and simpler earlier version found on ""Who's Afraid..."", released initially in 1984."
3,moments in love,I love this cd and wanted to have this version of moments in love . What a beautiful song. It was in good condition plays fine and I am satisfied. def buy again from this seller
5,Easy Does It Yoga,"Excellent reference books for those who need to sit in a chair and do yoga. Also has a very good overview of what yoga is all about.Would like to see a sequel to this book that does even more for those who need chair yoga!Thanks,Phil Pabich"
2,What a shame,"The only good thing about this collection is Buddy's singing. The only bad thing is the ""Picks"" singing in the background. IF Buddy would have meant for the songs to be arranged like this he would have!!! The fact that he didn't says it all !!!Let Great music alone."
1,Really an abomination,"Terrible is an understatement. I don't know who signed the deal to give these guys (the Picks) access to Buddy Holly's material, but they really did a disservice to one of the early masters of rock & roll. Check out one of the Holly albums not overdubbed by the Picks, and you'll be happier, or wait for release of a complete box."
1,Save your money,"Poor Buddy Holly. From listening to the Picks butcher his songs, it would be easy for one to conclude that they hated him! (I'm sure they didn't, really). I just cringe at the thought that someone who never heard Buddy's songs before could listen to this reprehensible collection first and totally get the wrong impression of him. The 20 Golden Greats album (Buddy Holly Lives) would be a better choice, if you can find it."
1,BUYER BEWARE ! ! ! !,Does not fit 2011 Pathfinder and also many other Pathfinder years. AMAZON IS IN ERROR as to compatibility even after you select the year make and model and style. Don't wast your time and money.
3,OK,Rather lame as a sequel to a very beloved book by the same author. A Lantern in her Hand was just wonderful.
5,My first Steinbeck!,"A very, very short but very, very wonderful book that takes place during WWII. In a remote, unnamed town in an unnamed country, Nazis take control, thinking themselves in an easy position with all the arrogance of a regime of people with radical ideals. They quickly discover it's not much of a picnic to be in a town full of people silently resenting you and ready to take action the moment one of the invaders lets down their guard, whatever the consequences. This book might have only been a bit over a hundred pages but it was vastly moving and really impressed itself on my mind. Highly recommended."
4,A must read for all!,"Steinbeck tells the story of WW II without ever telling the reader where the story takes place and who is fighting. Throughout the masterful novel, Steinbeck weaves the narrative of the Nazis and the common people who are defending their town together. Mayor Orden, the mayor of the occupied town, shows true leadership and is a true hero at the end of the novel. I think I was impressed most of all by Orden. Orden made me realize we should all have as much courage as he did to beat the enemy. Definitely a must read even if war novels don't appeal to you."
4,"Not The Best, But Good!","The Moon Is Down is a history book. It wasn't written to be such but it is now. It's a history of everything right and most things wrong during World War II.John Steinbeck takes us on a journey of a people conquered physically but not in their hearts and souls. It's a good read. . . a very good read, because it reminds us of what terrible things can happen, Man's Inhumanity to Man, to coin a phrase.But it also reminds us of strength and honor. It shows us what can be, good and bad.It is not Steinbeck's best but it is still good. It isn't Grapes of Wrath or Of Mice and Men, but not every book is. It's good, very good."
5,A brilliant classics,hey verywon i have read this book and i thinks itds fantastic.specially the characters.'an one more good thing is that itn is`nt to long so it dosent take so much time to read. Thi is a book you must read is the best.
4,Nothing To Shy Away From,"Nice story, and a nice execution of the story. Steinbeck's voice is strong and unflinching. But the whole thing hinges on the humanity of the invading soldiers - without that there's no meaning. And we all know about how human most Nazis were in their dealings with conquered people. So we're left with the sad sense of everyone taking their place on the Wheel of Life and playing their roles until death do us part. That is, it might have been more meaningful had the Nazi characters actually broken the mold big-time and translated some of their humanity into concrete actions useful to the populace instead of reverting to form and attempting half-heartedly the few stillborn sympathetic actions they did attempt. Nevertheless, the novel is tight, with Steinbeck not yielding to the temptation of playing out some of the more obvious scenes. You won't be bored and you won't be disappointed."
5,like it,Much food for thought in this book in the light of current affairs and events. Should be required reading for all liberals.
4,A different kind of Steinbeck,"This is possibly the most unusual Steinbeck contribution to the body of American literature. The underlying unique Steinbeck perspective and observation placed in a setting foreign to his other works makes The Moon is Down a necessary read for those interested in Steinbeck, but the book would be a worthy one without the author's name beneath the title. I'd recommend this one, no matter what the reading tastes of the reader."
3,The time of evil spirits coming into this small town,This describes an extraordinary impact as Allied propaganda in Nazi-occupied Europe.
2,"Good, but not what I wanted","This book is fantastic! I can see why it was so popular at the onset of WWII. However, I was expecting to receive a paperback, but what I got was a cheap high school issued small hardcover. If I want a hard cover I buy something with historical value - with the original dust jacket, perhaps. But if I buy a paperback it's so I can stuff it in my pocket, enjoy it on the train, etc. I e-mailed the seller as soon as I received the wrong item, but they never replied. Again, I enjoyed the book but am disappointed with the customer service."
1,Not Worth Your Time.,"The Moon Is Down is a story of war. Of a conquered people and their conquerors. You cannot tell from the story when or where this book really takes place. The British and Germans are involved but that is about all you can really tell. The story is about a small town with a coalmine and the conquering forces trying to get coal out of the mine. My issue with this story is that it was written in such a pedantic way that you never seem to make any progress. And at the end, are you no further along than you were at the beginning (you still have people being occupied). I finished reading it thinking it wasn't written very well, the plot was terrible and the characters never developed because they had no depth to begin with. A real waste of my time."
5,This long strange trip is MY long strange trip!,"The photographs in this book evoke a community and a culture that was a huge part of my own life during the Grateful Dead touring years. Looking through these photographs brought back so many great memories, and finding photos of familiar faces and places was both nostalgic and sentimental and at the same time incredibly satisfying. Thank you Jay!"
5,Great gift for the Deadhead!,I purchased this book for my husband's uncle. He and his wife used to follow the Dead. He adored this book. He even found a crowd picture that showed he and his wife. They were thrilled. The photography is wonderful.
3,jwylde,"If you want a well written book on the history of philosophy, and do not already have a philosophy of your own, this is your book. Russell does an incredible job of describing the philosophies of a huge number of philosophers.The problem is that he inserts his personal philosophy into that of others, in a way that makes it impossible to tell whose philosophy he is describing.To be concise, Russell removes any part of philosophy that, in his opinion, can't be proven ""scientifically"".In this sense, Russell in total opposition to any Socratic style philosopher."
5,Comprehensive.,"A great overhaul. For those interested in the stages philosophy has underwent, it is very comprehensive and readable."
3,A simple history,"Bernard Russell's history is famous mostly for expressing his bias. Nevertheless, the history does give a good introduction to classical and modern philosophy; however, it is ""empty"" in the middle. The Middle Ages are almost completely forgotten other than Aquinas and a chapter on the Franciscans in general. Too often Russell gives his opinion or worses, his personal experiences to invade the book, such as his section on Aquinas beginning with a complaint that some Catholics complained to him that it is immodest to question Aristotle or Aquinas...that's great, but it doesn't make either wrong or right.Etienne Gilson's ""The Unity of Philosophical Experience"" fills in the holes and is much better for drawing links between various trends of thought, such as Ockham and Hume or Augustine and Descartes."
4,Good supplement to Durant's book,"I started this shortly after reading Durant's History of Philosophy book, so its hard not to compare the two. Durant's book covered far less history and only a few select philosophers and I liked reading Durant's synopsis of the ones covered more than the similar shorter ones found here. Where this book seemed to excel was the amount of material covered, whereas Durant only covered a few, Russell covered a large number of philosophers and history. Just the amount of additional material covered here makes this a nice complementary read. Although both books are obviously biased and so I'll have to read a few more neutral accounts. I also didn't like that often in this book Russell seemed to go off on tangents about what he disagreed with and set up what seemed to be straw man arguments to disprove the other philosophers."
2,A shame it is so popular,"This book is horribly biased and even downright wrong in many places. Recommended only for people very experienced in WEstern philosophy who are able to recognize and see past Russell's biases. This is a good book for a quick reference for writing papers, but DO NOT read this book to get a general understanding of philosophy."
2,Too detailed for Introductory book,"My goal with this book is to get better understanding of what philosophy is. I found this book going into too many details and it was a hard read for me. If you what to understand the development of philosophy that could be a good book, but not as introduction."
3,Question about the title,"Is the book called ""The History of Western Philosophy"" or ""A History of Western Philosophy""?"
1,BAD HISTORY,"This ""History"" was a true disapointment. I had heard how wonderous this volume was, but upon reading it myself, I found it to be thoughly lacking in history and accuracy in depiction of the philosophers depicted. This has to be as bad as Durent's work on history of philosophy. I woudl give this book away, but I don't dislike anyone that much. Russell's depiction of previous philosphers was selfserving at best. All philosopher were to lead up to his philosophy. This books only should be used as a doorstop or kindling."
5,"Overall, a most challenging book. Personal and readable.","The book presents short summaries of the major philosophers, some of whom are not available through today's overly modern curriculum. Russell never panders.The book shows what was required for us to learn to think."
4,Microscopic analysis,The analysis of the philosophers and their philosophies is done with clinical precision. But somewhere you begin to feel the harshness of the criticism and the cynicism of the reviewer's mind jars on the readers' minds. The mind of Russell is one gigantic logical machine. The question is: can every human emotion be encapsulated by logic? Many a time we become witnesses to the demolition of the larger than life images of great thinkers - like Rousseau. It is as if Russell grudges them ( the philosophers ) their fame. But at the end of it all the book is a masterpiece and a work of monumental importance. Men like Russell are needed to keep the human race on the right track and be not led astray by the innocuous looking but dangerous writings of misled philosophers.
4,An entertaining and wholly partisan introduction,"Russell serves up a good read that will enable the intelligent layman to feel they know something about philosophy. His bias is obvious from the start and I imagine anyone who actually reads this book will be previously aware of it. The most refreshing debunking of Plato, Aristotle and other Greeks encourages the reader that philosophy is not the fossilised subject, unable to escape from the shadow of the ancients, that it once was."
4,russell rides,a good place to start the great journeyyou can't beat russell for clarity and elegancethis was Russell's most successful bookenjoy!
5,An excellant diverse collection. A fun CD,This is the first exposure I have had to the Uppity Blues Women and I love them. A good collection of songs you may have heard before and some very original music. A fun and thought provoking experience. Highly recommended.
5,Very Good Vegan,I was thinking of going vegan and picked up this DVD and Anna Maria made everything look so easy to make and the final results were so pleasing to the eye. I wish there were more video's out there so clear on a subject.
1,SHAME ON SKECHERS!!,"This was the 3rd time I bought Skechers, and I was very leary. I bought myself a pair a couple years ago, and in a very short time the elastic which acts in place of laces broke across the top. I NEVER wear out shoes. I own too many.Then I bought my 4 year old light up ones, and the lights in one shoe burnt out w/in 3 weeks. I've had Walmart brand shoes who's lights were still giong when the shoes wore out!Now a week ago I bought these shoes at Kohl's for my 10 year old, who begged me for them because the commercials are so cool. He wore them to school the first week. Friday he came home, and the stitching had come undone on the elastic strap on one of the shoes. I returned them today, and I will NEVER purchase Skechers again."
2,I'm baffled...,"...not by the mystery, but by all these glowing reviews! I thought the writing was tedious to the extreme, and the murderer was obvious before the murder even took place. Some of the characters were interesting, but the book itself was far, far too long."
2,Less then OK,Hardly reflective and WAY too expensive for the amount in the package. I was disappointed with this 3M product. Generally they are excellent.
2,Not Very Reflective,This tape really doesn't do much. I have a recumbent bike with a length of PVC piping on the back that I put lights on. I put some of this tape on the PVC piping and it is darker than the pipe. It would seem to work better on a dark surface were you don't need a lot of light reflected. It does stick well.
3,Okay,Works well in low light. Reasonable adhesion to the surfaces I have tried so far. Feels like it should last for a while and resist abrasion
1,terrible,"I bought this to apply to kids helmets and bikes for our night bike rides to look at the Christmas lights. The tape is terrible. It does not reflect at all and you can't even tell where I put it on the bikes! I thought perhaps it ""reflected"" better to cars/headlights so I had kids/hubby ride in front of our parked vehicle with headlight on. NOTHING. JUNK. Do not buy this for reflective gear for your bike- it is NO GOOD. Wish I could return it but it's already cut and on the bike/helmets. Save your money on this and buy blinking lights or spoke lights (which is what we did) to help make your bike more visible in the dark."
3,Does not work well on fabric,"I purchased this tape in hopes of making my dog's leash more reflective in low-light walking situations. While the tape is very reflective and did a great job at first, it quickly peeled off. i think it would work great on a more stationary surface, but not on something that constantly flexes."
3,Adequate - Used it to make baby stroller more visible for winter walks.,Wow - this is expensive for only 3 feet of tape. It was barely enough to stick to the metal framework of my grandson's stroller so we would be more visible when going for walks during dark winter afternoons. I'll need to buy some sew-on reflective tape to increase the visibility even more - this was inadequate.
3,"Reflective, but not as sticky as I'd hoped","I purchased this reflective tape to add to my dog leashes so we can be seen when walking early in the morning. The tape is reflective, but the tape split and came off after a week of use. I believe that this happened because of the fabric that the leashes are made of combined with the tension that the leashes are under when used. I am sure that the tape works great for more solid and stationary items, but it definitely doesn't work for dog leashes"
5,Excellent !,"While reading the book, i was under the impression I was chatting with my good friend Sophia! I found her advises very helpfull( even though the book was published in the eighties). Great scence of humor. I want to read another book by Sophia!"
5,Good Read,"I got this book to learn about the types of virtualization. I think this is a good anthology covering all the different topics. I'd give it a read if you are considering a virtual infrastructure and want to compare major vendor products. The book was really helpful with Microsoft products, as in Virtual Server and Virtual PC."
2,Good Idea! Good Book but too much technical errors!,"I bought this book because of the very good reviews, but i am very disappointed!The idea of a book which takes care of mostly all virtualization topics is great.Also the structure is good but there are a lot of informations inside which are false at all or in parts.Jason Eden mentioned examples of some really bad technical errors in a review before.And he is right!!In particular concerning VMware ESX, i think the authors never worked with them but writing a book about it.I give 2 Stars because like this book, but this misinformations cannot be forgiven and make somekind of a bad feeling to believe in the authors."
2,Cheesy Ceramic Dish...,"...hardly ""elegant"" as the decription states. Soap does not fit well in the dish. Would have returned it but I couldn't justify spending $5.00 and the time involved to get a $20 refund. Any old coffee mug would do just as well."
1,They must have been contaminated,"Contagion album as been infected by a disease, not a good one. I think they are trying too hard and can't succeed. May be it's their new line up that contaminated them. The result is just not good."
1,Yawn....,"I can't believe the rave reviews this band has received...here and in music mags. I was dumb enough to buy both their EPs without hearing them first, based on all the reviews I'd read. BAD JUDGEMENT on my part. Weak and completely lacking in dynamics despite what any reviewer has stated. Not bad as much as just plain weak. The guitarist likes to let you know they own a flanger pedal...on EVERY song. Pour on the reverb and pair it all up with weak lackluster rangeless female vocals singing lyrics that sound like they were written by a community college art student trying too hard to be profound. Track down an old Strange Boutique album or Slowdive CD instead if you like this formula, they do it much better."
5,Still Tasty After All These Years,"I was fortunate enough to catch the Good Rats perform the music from this album (!)at the time of its release. Having seen them when they were simply a real good bar band, the transformation was quite amazing. The material,and musicianship was incredible, and Peppi was a joy to watch. After all these years, this CD still knocks me out. As mentioned in several reviews, it is pretty confounding to know that they never made it bigger than they did, but, ""Tasty"" is an undeniable classic, and anyone who appreciates quality rock music,songwriting, and great guitar work will love it. P.S.-I heard ""Injun Joe"" on XM Radio's ""Deep Cuts"" yesterday, and it inspired me to testify!"
5,masterful,If nothing existed outside of Long Island during the 70's then these guys would be The Beatles and this was their Sgt. Pepper.
2,not for assessment testing,"Our PD went with an assessment testing, and this book did not prepare me at all for the tactical portion of the test."
4,police sgt exam prep,"Reasonable price, refers to the same study material suggested by EMPCO for the exam. The practice exams are able to let you know what areas you need to study up on. Good book"
4,Very good and different Storyline,"well acted , interesting storyline,definitely worth watching,picture and soundtrack is very goodit earns its 4 stars..enjoyable movie i will watch again"
3,Bad copies,"The movie itself is great however, in the middle of the movie, there are really bad pixelations in the video. Disc is not scratched or damaged so my only guess is that this was a defective copy."
3,Disappointing !!,"This COULD HAVE BEEN a great movie, but it was NOT. -- It is a pitty because the story is as good as one could wish for;but ... Blast and Bombast do not suffice to make a great movie ... The movie could have been made longer to develop morethe situations and the history and they could have saved time by showing less gore and blood than it was necessary ...Many sceness were just ""corny"". The story gets 5-stars; the director and the story-writter get a zero !!"
5,"SHIRI, TAE GUK GI, and now MY WAY. Amazing director!","Riveting. Brutal. Epic. All of the above. Director Kang Je-gyu sure knows how to make films that are heartbreaking. Based on the true story of an Asian man found on the beaches at Normandy during World War II, somehow the main character ends up being forced to fight for the Japanese, the Russians, and the Germans over the course of the film. There are at least five different languages spoken in this film: Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, and German. And then the credits roll with a wonderful song from Italy's own Andrea Bocelli. Truly a multinational picture. Contains amazing scenery and a jaw-dropping, climactic recreation of the Normandy invasion. Just don't watch it if you're squeamish. Very, very graphic in places. But so powerful."
5,My Way,"Great film, with a great plot. The story conveys the connection between two people of different backrounds in the face of the one of the cruelest elements a human can experience, war.***** Five Stars"
3,Good Effort but Too Long,"Hi, Good film and interesting story. I thought that the story needed some editing as it was over long. It dragged in spots. Coupled with ""over acting"" I had to resort to fast foward."
3,"a nice recap, but not much new","if you are an avid rodgers & hammerstein fan, you'll probably know 90% of the anecdotal information in this book, but if you're a casual fan who is desirous of learning more about the most influential writers of mid-20th century american musical theater, this book could serve as a perfect introduction.wilk's writing, as usual, is crisp, and he is always a good reporter. would that he were a bit more into analysis of the overwhelming success of these 2 fine shows, and why they touch so many people and remain more popular than the (imho) artistically superior CAROUSEL, SOUTH PACIFIC, or KING & I...one caveat to theater buffs: if you already own wilk's earlier volume on the making of OKLAHOMA, those chapters are a virtual rehash.this is a worthy -- if not essential -- volume for the library of a fan of musicals."
2,It has been ruined!,"I heard one song from this CD on the radio, Viente Anos. I thought the whole album would be similar: beautiful, old fashioned, and moving. Instead, the first 12 tracks were totally defiled by being 'modernized' with a modern giant band/orchestra added in electronically. How stupid and infuriating. Thank goodness at least the two last 'bonus tracks' weren't ruined in this manner, and were completely original versions of her songs. But I paid 30 bucks for two nice original songs by her, and I'm not happy."
3,"It works well, Forster or KMA is better.",I use this to turn necks on my .300 WM and .308. I manage to get little to no run out which I suspect is more to do with my Forster Co-AX and Bench rest dies than neck turning.The mandrel is small I use Lee neck sizer with the mandrels polished down to .301 and after neck sizing the case still fits easily on the .308 mandrel. This is good and bad and I'll explain why. It's good because you don't need a special die to expand the neck so it will fit the mandrel as with some other neck turning set ups. It's bad because it allows a bit of play especially when turning the top part of the neck. There is quite a learning curve which mean quite a few ruined cases.Also the cutter is not designed to be changed so when it wears out you have to buy a complete new tool. I don't care for the way the cutter set screw is set up. All in all it works but I would recommend the Forster or KMA product.
5,Best Daddy gift ever!,"This is an amazing book and makes every dad melt when his daughter shares her thoughts and he shares his. My father started the same book with me over ten years ago by giving it to me on Christmas with a few entries in his section. Then I gave it back to him on Father's Day with some of my entries. This was to be our tradition until the book was filled.I now have the privilege of giving this book to my daughter's dad so they can start their tradition (she is still little but why wait).Some dads have a hard time sharing their memories but this allows them to catalog the random things their daughter's will cherish later in life. And they get to know what was special to their daughter.Buy it for your dad, your husband, your brother - any dad you know!!"
2,"If you are slim, these are too big around the leg to do any good for support","I weigh just about 100 lb., and am 5'1"". These hose are much too big for me. Since there are no smaller sizes, I can't get the help from them that I get from Legs Everyday support hose, three pair for around $6.00. I checked them side by side and the stretch is just as strong on the cheapies, and they are half as big before you put them on, length and inches across. Very disappointed. If you are heavier or have more leg, they are silky feeling or appearing and you would probably think they are okay. I think they are way too expensive for what you get. I thought they would take me to the next level of more intense support, without resorting to compression hose. Barb H."
2,Waistband rolls down constantly,What is the point of control top hose if the waistband rolls down constantly. It doesn't control anything but my time because I have to keep pulling it up again. I would pass on these.
3,5 STARS FOR FAST ARRIVAL,"I GAVE IT 5 STARRS FOR FAST ARRIVAL ,3 STARRS ON HOW IS MADE ..WHEN IT ARRIVED I COULDNT BELEIVE IT WAS THE SLEEPNG BAG ,VERY SMALL PACKAGE. WHEN I TRIED TO TAKE SLEEPNG BAG OUT OF VERY SMALL DRAWSTRING BAG, I THOUGHT THE DRAWSRING BAG WAS SUSPOSE TO BE ALITTLE BIGGER SO A SLEEPNG BAG COULD FIT, YES I KNOW THERE TO BE ALITTLE SNUG BUT NOT THIS SNUG.. I RIPED IT ..THE CARRING BAG FOR IT MADE TOO SMALL FOR SLEEPING BAG..EVEN IF I DIDNT RIP BAG THERES NO WAY I'D BE ABLE TO PUT SLEEPNG BAG BACK IN!! I THOUGHT THATS THE REASON YOU HAVE A CARRYING BAG FOR YOUR SLEEPNG BAG..EASY TO TAKE PLACES.ETC..THEY ARE VERY NICE BECAUSE YES KIDS WILL LOVE SLEEPING IN IT BUT FOR AGES 2- MAYBE 5 VERY SMALL ..COST MORE THEN I SHOULD OF SPENT FOR HOW IT WAS MADE"
2,A flimsy sleeping bag,"I bought this Cars sleeping bag for my 5 year old grandson. I liked that it could be rolled in its own bag for storage or carrying. I was very surprised how thin it was when it arrived. His family does camp but he certainy couldn't use this comfortably on the floor or ground. I was disappointed in the quality and padding. If he's on a bed, I guess it will be fine but other than that, it's not worth it."
4,The master at work,"This book is a wonderful collection of work by Atget. One, at least I, tend to forget just how influential Atget was in bridging documentary photography to art. One star off because I wish the book had larger dimensions and better print quality, not that the quality is bad. This is an excellent value for a budget book."
1,Cheap junk,"This product is worthless. You'd be better off keeping your money and buying a good case at a store. Overpriced, cheap, plastic-y rip-off. No ""deluxe"" here."
3,Holster your Camera,"The best way to describe the Fuji S5000 Camera Case is that it is shaped like a large gun holster with a cover. It acts just like that since the camera, alone no supplies, fits into the case. The case flap folds over the camera and the camera shoulder strap is the strap for the case. Make sure the case is snapped shut and the little case strap is connected to the camera or you will lose the camera case. It would have been nice to have a pocket for supplies like extra batteries and picture cards. It would have been a complete package then. Now it is just a camera holster."
2,Camera case,"Nothing special and probably over-priced for what it is. The leather is nigh on invisible.It's more of a skin to protect the camera from scratches, ""case"" would be stretching the definition somewhat."
1,Poor design.,Nice looking. Good quality.But the case has two large flaps on the sides which make it difficult to put the camera in and out.
1,No extra room.,The case fits like a tight glove. I don't like that. The camera was hard to get in and out and didn't have any pockets for straps or batteries.
3,Product description lacking critical information ...,"There are a few options when ordering a replacement nut for your Floyd Rose tremelo. Make sure that you find out whether you need the 1-11/16"" (42.85mm) or 1-5/8"" (41.27mm) size. Also keep in mind (and this is important) there are right handed and left handed versions. The difference is in the cut spacing that the strings will fit into. Using a left handed replacement nut for a right handed neck will result in poorly fitting (and buzzing) strings in the nut. In my case I bought a left handed neck even though I play right handed. I still need a right handed nut for the correct string fitting even though the neck is a lefty.Unfortunately this critical information is missing on Amazon's product description. It gives the correct nut width but neglects to tell you if they're selling the right handed or left handed version. Take your chances or find the same product cheaper (and they are out there) with the correct information elsewhere."
3,Wrong fence...haven't got to use it yet...,"My guess is that this is a very nice saw, but I haven't been able to use it since the wrong fence was sent to me, and Amazon hasn't done a good job getting the problem solved. I bought the saw on February 22, and they estimate that the correct fence will be deliverd on April 4. I wouldn't recommend purchasing large equipment like this from Amazon based on this experience.Again, I'm sure this is a great saw, but I'm still waiting to find out for sure."
4,"Great, lots of old stuff and some new","I have always been a babes in toyland fan.They combine innocence with some very female hard music.Plus they know how to make sweetness and light with songs such as (we are family).This 2 cd set is a must have for all babes fans.They also have (and always will have occut undertones.Kat Bjelland and Courtney Love used to have a group together if you need any indication on what kind of sounds babes play,yet they have stuck with the harder tunes.I really think this is a must have for all fans."
4,If your child likes blocks.....,".....They'll probably *love* these! :) My daugher, who is 2 yrs. old, really enjoys playing with them. This set comes with 'flash' cards with pictures on them that your child can try to duplicate. Many different patterns. They're fun and easy for little hands to snap together. :)"
4,Relevant God & Culture,"Relevant Magazine has great articles for people who are in to culture and faith. Many of the reviews are of secular artists, the spiritual content or message (or lack thereof) of the music they sing, films they make and books they write. They also review Christian artists, many who are on the fringe. This is a great magazine for those who are interested in these things. If you just want a 'youth-oriented' Christian magazine with Bible studies and how-to's you'll probably be disapointed."
5,RELEVANT HIGH SCHOOL,"I am in high school, and am Catholic. It's great o see how many positive posts there are! I have been subscribed since day one, and I am a huge fan of what relevant stands for. And I have to plug: if you haven't already, check out www.relevantmagazine.com and look at music, slices, God, and progressive. This is a great magazine--my entire school reads my issue each month!!!"
2,I'M RELEVANT! REALLY I AM!! I'M SO RELEVANT!!!,"Please read Naomi Jakobs' review for Relevant Magazine below. It captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the Christian 'post-modern' kick. If you have to go out of your way to claim you're a celebrity, then you simply aren't a celebrity (Take ""Fitness Celebrity"" John Basedow for example). In the same way, if you have go out of your way to claim that the Post-modern Evangelical movement is relevant, then you're claim for relevancy is simply not credible. The Christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years. However pop-culturalizing Evangelical Christianity isn't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when Sandi Patty or Carmen ruled the Christian top 40. Does the fact that some Christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable?"
1,The Reality of Relevant,"In this current day of irrelevant religon, RELEVANT magazine is doing it right. They are taking risks. They are smashing stereotypes. They are knocking down walls of status quo. I do believe that RELEVANT will always need to keep their edge in check. After, all they are going where few have gone before. Their commentary on culture is balanced with their deep emphasis on God. They are forcing a new paradigm where believers are challenged to intersect their faith with their culture. The natural outcome is a RELEVANT generation. What a concept. Sounds Biblical or something."
5,Relevant Rocks,"Relevant is a must read magazine for all who are in their 20s. The content is fresh and layouts are pleasing to the eye. If you believe you can have a positive impact on a hurting world, you need to read Relevant.Be Relevant- Get Relevant."
2,Something doesn't feel quite right...,"Last night, I actually bought the latest issue of Relevant at a local book/music store. I really want to like this magazine, but my mom always told me to listen to that voice inside and something doesn't quite feel right here. Don't get me wrong, it's refreshing to have a slick, modern, ""Christian"" magazine with some good articles, but I keep feeling like I am reading the ""Christian"" version of Slate magazine. I get the feeling that the theme is ""there is good(God) in everyone, and that's enough,"" and frankly that's a scary theme. There is a definite social/progressive theme that seems almost political... without coming out and admitting it?I think its a great question to ask, ""What Would Jesus Do?"" But I feel like Relevant magazine is telling me What Jesus Would Do with a nod and wink, and a ""trust us!"" I'm not so sure I do..."
5,Heat It Up,"I want to applaud young blues performers who are the next generation of blues, because they are sustaining the spirit of the blues. Shemekia,the daughter of the late Johnny Copeland , has good reason to do so and she does in a powerful way. When she turns the heat up you know its hot. Shemekia is a talented vocalist who sings with pain and power beyond her years. She expresses a gutsy independence in her duet with Joe Louis Walker ""My Turn Baby."" She sings ""Your Mama's Talking"" like a tough old lady.Her second cd ""Wicked"" is out now and while I don't own it, the cuts I have heard are good. I know that we will be hearing more from her. If you like Etta James and Koko Taylor take a listen to Shemekia. It will be exciting to listen to her as she carves her niche in the blues."
4,This lady sings the Blues!,"Shemekia can belt them out with the best of them. I first got ""Wicked"" and knew she was a young singer with a voice that had the power of the older more experienced female blues singers. When I got Turn the Heat Up, her earlier Cd, I was impressed with her vocal range, her gospel feel, R&B , all around blues. Shemekia is going to be a force on the blues scene so take notice! Congratulations on your Handy awards, we will be hearing more and more of you Shemekia! I would give this a 4 1/2 star rating if there was one. Her potential is still climbing, there is great stuff to come."
4,Hotness,A great debut. She is one of the most under-rated artists. A must-have for contemporary Blues fans - and for lovers of old-school Soul.
2,UGLY,A movie of unremittant ugliness & crudeness of spirit. Its redemptions are that it has a sense of reality & is well done for what it is.
5,Unforgetable,"Betty Faria was amazing in her performance with Fausta. She should be indicated to Oscar for this work. No one in Brasil could do that better, even Fernanda Montenegro."
3,"OK, but seemed like it worn fast","I bought this and the 1 inch flat chisel for my makita rotary hammer. It seems like this wore out a lot faster then the flat chisel. I used it for about 45 minutes yesterday and it is not fully dull, but getting there. I thought it could have been me the way i was using it, but like I said I bought the hitachi 1 inch also and that looks great after 30 minutes of use. I was breaking up 4 inch slab with it and both chisels worked well, but the bull point just seems like I have 1 more job on it then it will be dull."
4,A Dark & Gritty Batman!,In this Graphic Novel DC let the fans decide via Phone Hotline vote whether or not Jason Todd would live. The fans had their say in this epic Batman tale as the Dark Knight fails to save his sidekick.
1,Just not very good,"So many other great Batman stories were written around this time -- Alan Moore's Killing Joke, Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns, Grant Morrison's Arkham Asylum. This is not one of them."
2,"Important to Batman Timeline, but that is the only reason to read","First, I want to state no graphic novel is going to get five stars from me. As much as I enjoy Batman, to give any of them five stars would be a stretch. After all, how many are on par with Twain, Fitzgerald, Hemmingway, ect.So, with that said, I have to state this is even poor for a graphic novel. The plot line is weak. The story itself is weak. If not for the killing of a key member in the Batman family, this would be unreadable.In other words, read it for the time line within the Batman realm, but do not think that you are getting a great story."
1,The Worst Batman Story Ever!!!,"And the best Batman story ever is only like 4 stars anyway, and that's only on a good day. So this story, being the worst Batman story ever, doesn't stand a chance. Robin was voted dead by Batman readers, and they pinned it on the Joker. If Batman ever finds out he's going to beat his readers down. You have been warned.Also Jim Starlin is the 14th worst mainstream comicbook writer of all time. (My super-computer did the calculations.) He's right below Steve Englhart and right above that Mraz guy who used to write Green Lantern. I wish my super-computer wasn't such a geek!"
5,Awesome value,"All of the other reviews do a good job of telling you about the story, so I won't rehash that here. What they don't tell you is that this new edition of A Death in the Family also contains the rare out of print TPB A Lonely Place of Dying. That makes this a great value worth getting in that you have the death of one Robin, Jason Todd, and the introduction of the next, Tim Drake. Unfortunately for me, I didn't know about that when ordering these stories and now I have a TPB copy of a Lonely Place of Dying that I'll need to sell now... :("
2,an important history of batman but mediocre story,"i can't believe how jim starlin made this illogical plot. the idea is promising, the end of robin. it's an interesting and very potential idea to blow the readers' emotion but executed poorly as a whole story. the art: jim aparo, not the best choice for the story. his style is not realistic enough to convey a potential emotion. duet of neal adams and dick giordano or duet of don newton and alfredo alcala would be much better. thanks God the inker did a good job!! he really added deeper emotion in batman pictures. the colorist, adrianne roy, he is not a right choice for the story. his vibrant color pallette simply doesn't match with the feel of the story. it's better to leave the drawings without color or choose someone else. last thing, the story is so racist, not a good choice."
5,GOOD COMIC,"I have been a Batman fan since kid, almost 30yrs. I was looking for this compilation awhile ago and definitely found it here. This is one of the most emotionally comics ever seen. You can feel the soft human side of the Bat. I will treasure this one as one of my fav."
4,Excellent story line,"anyone looking into this book should buy it. It's an excellent read very easy to follow, and is one of the most defining moments in the batman universe"
5,I wish I could have coffee (or a diet pop) with the author!,"What a hoot! This book is exactly what I needed... puts things in perspective and guides you through the ups and downs of dieting.I felt like Ann Douglas was a true girlfriend at the end of the book. I was motivated and lost 50 pounds... and that was a terrific thing. The book went with me everywhere.... it's perfect to read on the stationary bike! Everyone at the gym asked me about it, and I am sure the sales went up just from my testimonials. I give it to my girlfriends and they love it for the information, but they love the humour too.It's not a typical ""diet"" book, which is so refreshing in this day and age!"
5,Ok. haven't really used it yet.,Ok. haven't really used it yet. fits and seems to be decent quality. It will be handy for chipping up tile and smoothing out rough rocks in our yard.
4,Accurate Length?,"My Grizzly band saw uses blade length of 131-1/2 inches. After (2) Grizzly blades, I am trying the Magnate version. I had to adjust the top pulley location to take up the slack caused by the Magnate. Now I don't know if the Griz is a bit short, or the Magnate is a bit long.No matter, if you know how to adjust for this on your saw it runs OK.David"
4,Mello Tiki Lounge Music,"The CD is good mellow atmosphere music that makes you feel lke your on the islands in a jungle tiki lounge, it is not that brassy intrusive sound like Martin Denny's music. You even have jungle sounds mixed in to add to the atmosphere."
3,The cover is better than the music,"Although I am a fan of Lyman's music, as well as that of Martin Denny, this album leaves something to be desired. First of all, the music is quite uneven. In addition, a few of the songs get really loud in volume compared to the rest of the disc. The cover of the CD however is classic. It reminds me of the shrunken heads they used to sell at Disneyland."
4,The best out there so far,"In 2005-2006 I taught a grammar class both semesters at a university. The class was made up of English majors (and people from other disciplines) who wanted to improve their writing and pre-service ESL teachers who needed to know about the structure of English. Due to the high cost of this book I undertook a search to find if there was any other book out there I'd rather that my students have. I didn't find one. This book is the best combination of the prescriptive and descriptive grammar I wanted that I was able to find.If you are a linguist and you are looking purely for descriptive grammar, you could definitely start with this book, but you might want to go on to The Grammar Book (by Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman) or the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English (by Biber, et al.)If I were teaching a descriptive-grammar class at the undergraduate level, I might consider the Longman Student Grammar of Spoken and Written English."
5,English instructor approved,"I was introduced to this book as an undergraduate in an English BSE program. My high school teachers, like many, went light on the grammar. I learned a lot from the book and so did my fellow future English teachers. I now refer my students to this book. This book explains things thoroughly and clearly. If you are doing it on your own, you can just do the exercises for the areas in which you need to improve. Since the answers are in the back, you can check yourself immediately. Don't be turned off by the price of the book. It is worth the money."
3,Does this book ring a bell?,"One can see that to a certain extent this nice English textbook echoes Kolln's ""Understanding English Grammar"".However, the key difference lies in the fact that unlike Kolln's, Barry's text does not use Reed-Kellogg diagrams to represent the structure of sentences.One of the best features of ""English Grammar"" is Chapter 13 SENTENCE ANALYSIS. In this chapter, a method of describing the very complicated sentences that occur routinely even in common conversation is presented in terms of simple sentences, compound sentences, complex sentences, and compound-complex sentences. These kinds of complex sentences are grouped together and summarized in only one chapter, whereas in Kolln's text such concepts are scattered around."
4,Good book and service,"The service was as promised, condition as promised and prompt mailing. Book is very detailed - more than necessary but excercises are good. Recommend this seller"
5,LIKE NOTHING I EVER READ BEFORE,"LIKE NOTHING I EVER READ BEFORE AS FAR AS HISTORY AND WAR BOOKS ARE CONCERNED. THIS BOOK WAS A TOTAL JOY EVEN THOUGH IT PERTAINED TO WAR AND HISTORY, TWO SUBJECTS USUALLY AVOIDED BY MANY PEOPLE. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO READERS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS.PAMELA ANDERSON PHILADELPHIA, PA"
3,Better than expected,"If this movie were remade today with Brad Pitt, Matthew McConaughey, or equal star power (take your pick) in the male lead and Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Aniston, or equal star power (take your pick) in the female lead, it would be a smash hit. Tom Berenger, for all his talents, and despite how good he was in this film, is not heartthrob material, and Elizabeth Perkins, who I like a lot, lacks the sex appeal her role called for, and there was no real chemistry with Berenger. On the other hand, Anne Archer was perfect, as was Kate Capshaw and Annette O'Toole. My only other complaint is the pace of the movie was a little too slow, but things picked up nicely at the end. Still, I enjoyed the movie and felt it was worth the viewing."
4,The gravel voiced detective,"This movie reminds one very much of a 40's film:the gravel voiced detective who gets his case all sideways,but finds his own kind of true anyway.The cast and script are both very good.I really enjoyed this movie and except for being a little slow at times,the movie delivers the goods."
2,Not For Me,So apparently everyone else sees something in this movie that I didn't because I thought it was awful. Waste of Money and Time.
1,"Great, but my EARS are bleeding...","First, let me say I have NO PROBLEM with the content of this film. It is entertaining and educational. Plus, I love the idea of a female Hispanic role model for children. My problem is that I cannot stand the VOICES of the children on this video. They speak in the most extremely loud and shrill ""broadway style"" voices, I literally had a headache listening to this video after 15 minutes.Let me add here that I am an ELEMETARY SCHOOL ART TEACHER by trade, so I am very used to children's voices, especially loud ones working in my room, out at recess, in the cafeteria, etc. It's not that my ears are overly sensitive. When I went to work,I listened to children all day every day. And 95% of my days I did not go home with a headache. The kids on this video have been coached to SHOUT their lines as if they are trying to address a herd of deaf dogs in Alaska.If all the videos are this shrill, save your ears and your $, stick to the books and toys."
5,"This another great episode about Dora's cousin, Daisy!","I like this DVD. The first episode had Daisy asking Dora to save the soccer game. Now it has Dora's cousin Daisy celebrating her 15th birthday party. I like this DVD the best. My name is Daisy, too. I liked it when Dora and Boots gave Daisy her crown and shoes. But look out. When you get to the fiesta la quincenera, it's time to mambo! This DVD is my favorite. When Dora and Boots get to the rain forest, Dora's cousin Diegot ags along. Diego is Daisy's brother. My three favorite characters in this DVD are Dora, her cousin Diego, and his sister Daisy."
5,Finally: MMT is Expounded,"Tragically, scholarship has mostly ignored the significance of 4QMMT (Miqsat Ma'ase ha-Torah), since being discovered in 1953. But alas, Professor Lawrance Schiffman has arrived to set the record straight. In this book, Professor Schiffman (thoroughly, simply and undeniably) demonstrates the early existence of specific Pharisaic ideas in 150BCE, that were later attributed to the Beit Hillel school of Pharisees. Thus, the claim that Pharisaic Judaism is some (post 70ce / post Temple) concoction of the Rabbis has now been reduced to the rubbish heap - where it always belonged. Thanks Professor. This is very much appreciated!!!"
2,Cheaply Made,"The pot I received was packed without any cushioning material whatsoever, so the fragile porcelain covering was chipped in several places and now obviously rusting after only a couple uses. When I pick the pot up, it feels flimsy (I weighed it at six pounds empty), and it feels like it is going to cut my fingers with its sharp edges. Despite all that, I am going to keep the pot, because I can can 9 quarts at a time with it for a while until it completely rusts through."
3,Lift how?,"There are no handles to lift it, so when it is full of hot water it is a little dangerous to move!!!!"
2,too big,"This canning put is too big for my stove and won't even fit in my sink, so filling it with water is a hassle. The bottom diameter is 15 1/2 inches and it's 10 inches high. This is too big, and I should have bought a slightly smaller item. And having no handles is a GOOD thing for this model. When full of water it would be too heavy, and the handles would likely break off."
1,Selected boring stories,"Sorry, I didn't enjoy of these stories. Over involved about stuff and situations that are way out-dated, I guess."
5,"Helpful, explanatory, it worked, I use it","This book just presents what the author has learned and backs it up with examples, and that's why it's so great. No gimmicks and no unfounded speculations. Tells how it works and gives specific examples of people effectively using every principle and technique given. Shows how visualization is an integral part of any endeavor or aspect of life, and thus how to improve any aspect of your life. I've discovered much of it to be true and effective through my own experience."
2,"OK, BUT NOT GOOD FOR ARCIVAL OF PHOTOS",PURCHASED THE CD-R ARCHIVAL GOLD TO STORE PHOTOS. IT WILL ONLY HAD A FEW PHOTO IMAGES. DELKIN NEEDS TO BEING OUT ARCHIVAL GOLD DVDs TO STORE PHOTOS ON.
3,+1/2. Happy holidays from the man in black...!,"A collection of a dozen Cash Christmas oldies, gathered from over a couple of decades. The stuff off his 1980 ""Classic Christmas"" album is every bit as ludicrous and appalling as folks have said: the shrill vocal chorus and cluttered ""classical"" arrangements are a real mismatch for Johnny's voice, and tend to drown him out. But some of the older material (which dates back to the early '60s) is pretty sweet and shows Cash at his most charismatic and committed. The disc ends with a previously unreleased live recitation tune, ""Christmas As I Knew It,"" which is pretty nice, despite the low fidelity (and even some telephones ringing in the background during one verse!) A nice holiday offering, though the '80s stuff will probably get on your nerves."
3,GRAB-BAG OF CHRISTMAS SONGS.,"A few tracks from his first Christmas album (""The Christmas Spirit"") and his last (""Classic Christmas"") and a track from his 1970's TV show thrown in. These albums are available in their entirety, so you might want to give those a try. This one is only for the casual Johnny Cash fan."
4,Surprise!,I never listened to this cd but bought it as a gift for some friends that seem to have all of his albums. They were really surprised that I found it and listened to it all season long! Great gift for a true Cash fan! Enjoy!
4,Recently found this and started listening again!,"My wife found this this past weekend when we started putting up the christmas decorations. We put it in and have been enjoying it all week. We're both big Johnny Cash fans, so it was a given that we would like this CD.Consider this if you are looking for something different for the johnny cash lover in your life."
4,Johnny Cash reasonable Christmas,"This CD has Johnny Cash in good voice at a reasonable cost. He is accompanied by a chorus on most songs, but they are not too intrusive.The songs included are:1.I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day2.The Christmas Guest (spoken)3. Hark the Herald Angels Sing4.The Gives They Gave5.Blue Christmas6.Merry Christmas Mary7.O Come All Ye Faithful8.Away in a Manger9. the Christmas spirit10.Joy to the world11.Silent Night12. Christmas as I Knew ItIt's still a cheery Christmas record especially if you enjoy Johnny Cash"
2,Gave away after one listen,"I love Johnny Cash... sometimes.This CD was mostly the ""droning"" Johnny Cash, rather than the compelling Johnny Cash. It was not happy Christmas listening, and we gave it away right away."
2,Mercedes-Benz Technical Companion,"This is truly a hit or miss bunch of articles for all Mercedes cars. Don't buy if you want absolute information on what your working on. It has how to's specific to different models on many issues. Then it has tons of forum questions and answers. It's the cheapest book with any real info, they should rewrite it per model."
