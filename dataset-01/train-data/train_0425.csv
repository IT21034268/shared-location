5,The clorinator works great - like new!,I hooked it up and it works just like a new one. Good product at a lower price!
5,Excellent Chlorinator,This chlorinator is exactly the same brand and model number that was selling locally for almost twice the price. It is an excellent chlorinator and works great.
1,BEWARE!! Photo is Wrong -Photo is NOT a CL100,"I just received the item. It was to replace the same item I had that was malfunctioning after years of usage. I selected based upon the photo. What I received was the inline chlorinator model CL100, the photo shows the model CL200 (the one I wanted). The Cl200 shown in the photo is much larger, holds twice the number of chlorine tabs and has a larger and easier to utilize dosage dial. There actually is a review posted here prior to mine warning about the wrong photo, but I didn't see it until it was too late. I just arranged for a return and found the better, larger model (CL200) to be CHEAPER, as well."
1,Wrong Photo,Ordered a replacement Hayward chlorinator by the photo seen on Amazon.The photo they show for the CL100 is actually the CL200 model which is fairly largerand holds twice the chlorine tablets.I am sure the CL100 is a quality auto chlorinator as is the CL200 but just be sure you are ordering the correct model as the photo shows the larger model with the optional base removed.
1,the good thing is that its over quick,"ya they can't manage to churn out more than 4 songs on 2 of their 4 albums but then that's a good thing. i have 'em all as well as the metal chuch albums as well. this might be the worst out of all of 'em. Mike Howe is such a better singer, it isn't even funny. by now, David Wayne's screeching voice is utterly annoying and his lyrics about evil this and evil that are cartoonish and childish. and no the Fake Healer cover is not better, it's not good whatsoever...Fake Healer (the Metal Church version) was a good song with meaningful lyrics about how the medical industry screws you. he has lyrics with nonsense about eeeeevil this and eeeevil that while he squeals ad naseum like we're all supposed to be scared or something. and they don't nearly play it as well, nor is the production quaility there. sorry Dave, we've all grown up now, this is just garbage."
5,THE NINE LIVES OF ROMEO CRUMB-LIFE ONE,"This is a wonderful book filled with detailed storytelling, visual images that stimulate the imagination, and witty dialogue. L. Rifkin takes us inside the world of cats as they live their lives, and soon one forgets they are cats because the situations are so humanlike. Both my 3rd grader and my 6th grader loved Romeo and his friends and villains, which prompted me to read the book as well. Children have become such sophistacted readers since the emergence of ""Harry Potter"", and I feel L. Rifkin never talks down to them and presents the dangers of animal life accurately and with fun. We can't wait for ""Life Two."""
3,Odd,"This is weird German indie music, and that's just what it sounds like. Sometimes the incredible quirkiness is simply too much, but the first part of the CD is OK, but it goes on and on and on, you will pray for the end. Best track is `Let's Split'"
5,I really enjoy this,I really enjoy this external card now I can work on 2 screens. Best part is I didnt have to open the computer to intall the card. You can just pull into the USB port and you are ready to go
2,my thoughts,this product takes up way too much cpu to use it effectively. If you have a quad core processor it might work ok but for a dual core or lower I would stay away.
4,It is nice to have third monitor...,"But giving me a litlle bit of problems when the computer goes to sleep... the computer's video driver is stalling and gets restarted, this is on a Windows 7 computer."
2,didn't work well with win7 64bit unit,returned product constantly blinked in and out and switched document from secondary screen to main screen constantly. did not like it at all
5,Great value and design,"This worked out of box on two laptops. One that is several years old running Windows XP, and my new laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium. Should be easy enough to install and configure for even novice users. Be sure to clearly check if your display resolution is supported before buying. I didn't and mine is currently sitting in a box of spare computer parts. :-( But that was my fault because I must have got products crossed when I was checking so many reviews."
4,Easy!,"Super easy to ""install""; our 10 year old could've done it. Took literally less than 10 minutes. Works terrific! I'd highly recommend it to anyone."
1,Corrupted my video drivers,"This product had promise for adding a screen to my Lenovo T42 laptop. I installed it per instructions and when I hooked it up, only my laptop LCD display worked. There appears to be an incompatibility between this device and the ATI device drivers. After removing it, I could no longer use the video out on my docking station, ""Could not load OEMDSPIF.DLL"". After much trial and error, I had to uninstall this software, uninstall the laptop ATI display drivers, then reinstall the ATI drivers, and you can imagine how many reboots and missteps that all took. It was hours before I was able to use my laptop again.Clearly this product is not for me."
1,Does not support wide screen monitors,"The unit only supports resolutions compatible with standard 4:3 monitors. Does not have resolutions for widescreen. No help from company. Support only open during business week. Drivers are updated, last 12/17/07. Nothing in latest verson that can help. Save your money."
4,"Used for years, great","I've been using this little box for years and I think it's just great. Contrary to what others said I run widescreen off this box and always have. It does, however, noticably slow down your system if you have an older cpu. You most likely wouldn't even notice on a new machine."
5,Working at home is so much easier,I recommend anyone who has to work with excel spreadsheets to buy one. We have the IOGEAR at work and I love having the ability to use two monitors so I bought one for home. I bring work home a lot and it just makes it so much easier and quicker to get it all done.
3,"First one didn't work, second one works great","Bought this for my office to increase my screen real estate. I wanted to be able to use it through a powered USB hub along with my other USB devices since I swap out laptops often. The first one I bought was a bust-- could only get it to work once or twice with my PC laptop, and never on my Macbook. I returned it and chanced it on another one. THe second one works like a charm-- works through a powered USB hub without a hitch on both my PC and Mac laptops. Hopefully this one won't give out like the first one."
1,The Worst Customer Service,"The item doesn't work on my win7 after downloading the updated driver. I tried to reach the IOGEAR customer service, which turned out to be time wasting. They let me wait for ten minutes and when I finally got into the live chat room nobody responded to my questions at all. Will resort to my credit card company to get my money back."
5,Perfect!,"Who knew you could buy something like this? It's basically a video card that sits outside of your PC. You plug it in via USB and load some drivers and BAM you have another video out. Use it to extend your screen to another monitor if you want.I use it to connect my HDMI-only laptop to older projectors that only accept VGA input. It makes sure I'm not stranded with no way to connect to a client's projector.Don't trust those cheap cables that promise to convert HDMI to VGA. You know that won't work, not for that price. Do it the right way and buy this converter from IOGEAR, a trustworthy company that has been around for what seems like forever. You can't go wrong, and it has a lot of different uses."
4,It works,"It works as advertised.I needed this because the external VGA port on my laptop stopped working for some weird reason (???). This IOGear saved me from having to do an expensive laptop repair, instead I just use this little device when I need to do presentations on an external monitor.I have Windows Vista, and it works fine. There's a little bit of flakiness - some occasional driver warnings pop up - but I just ignore them and the device seems to work ok.Don't count on it having a fast enough refresh rate for video games, but for showing PowerPoint screens, it's just fine."
2,Does not support Windows 7,"I am very disappointed with this graphics card as it is not compatible with Windows 7. You get a disk with the card, and if you have Windows 7 and try to install the Iogear software it will give you a message saying it is not compatible with your OS. It also does not state in the manual that it is compatible with Windows 7."
1,Didn't Work,I have Vista and this item didn't work with it. I would always get Device has been disabled error. Returned the item.
4,Great when you have no other alternative,"I've been using dual monitors for years, so when I learned that our company's new workstations were of the mini-me variety with only 1 video out and no slots to add a video card I was a little panicked (once you've gotten used to multiple displays, going back to just one is awful). After much searching I found this product and decided I'd take a gamble on it.Many months later, I am glad to report that it just plain works. It drives my secondary monitor and is reasonably crisp and perfectly acceptable at a resolution of 1280 X 1024. It's not the most beautiful display, you obviously wouldn't want to game, do image editing, or use at your primary display; but it is just fine for a secondary. I've experienced no driver issues or other strange behavior. It has exceeded my expectations."
3,Low resolution,"I should have read the details on this before buying. The highest resolution is not high enough to match my other monitor. Otherwise, this device does what is says it does. No need to install any software. Just plug and play."
5,Transformers Generation One: Guidebook Vol. 1,This book contains lots of info about your favorite characters from the original Transformers including the toy characters as well. It also includes some characters' personal rivalry with another. I highly recommend this book for any Transformers Fans.
1,hackneyed,Outside of regurgitating timeworn examplesthe author does not appear to have any directionfor the text. Save your money.
5,Perfect for vegetarian diet,"I am thankful that Country Life makes these vegetarian mineral combination pills. Calcium and magnesium can be in short supply in a strict vegetarian diet. Lack of these minerals can cause many health problems. Be advised, the pills are whoppers and you have to take 2 a day."
2,If you are a horse these are for you,I have never in my life had a problem swallowing pills. But these Country Life Calcium Magnesium pills are the biggest & hardest I have ever taken. Some days I simply can't get them down. I don't recommend them unless you have no problem swallowing huge pills.
2,Le junque,"This scale is great at giving consistent readings if you repeatedly step on and off of it. Walk away for 5 minutes and come back--wow! You gained 2 lbs!There apparently is some sort of short-term memory fxn on this scale which displays the same number on repeat weighings; if you give it a few minutes to ""forget"", however, the precision of this scale shows its true flawed design. For a scale that is supposed to give 0.1 lb incremental info, it's just not that hot."
2,Ww 30 scale inconsistent!,"I bought this scale a few years ago, and used to think that my flooring was uneven or hardwood floors not a suitable surface. But it appears to just be junk. I have stepped on the scale four times in five minutes, and received three different weights. I'm sure I didn't lose two pounds, or gain a pound in the last three days. I am sorry I bought it, am going to purchase a well-rated Eat Smart scale today."
1,How upsetting.,"This scale told me I had lost 121 pounds. I worked hard to lose, so I believed it, but I found out I've only lost 70 pounds, so it's a LOT off.. How unfair. And what jerks... Grr."
4,Review of WW Scale,"This scale is very accurate, even to the 10th of a pound. It's thin and works with any decor. A+!"
1,"If there was a 0 star option, this product would get it","This scales is HORRIBLE. It is extremely inconsistent and misleading. My husband, who hadn't weighed on it in a few weeks, stepped on to find he lost 15 lbs. He was all excited until I had to break the news to him that one of the rubber footies had come loose and was giving him an inaccurate weight. I knew this because I compared my own weight on my other digital scales vs these and there was a dramatic difference. We turned the scale upside down to find out what could be wrong when I discovered the little foam padding had slipped loose. It's disheartening to think the result of all of my weight loss efforts weighs (no pun intented) on a small round piece of glued-on foam."
1,Piece of Junk,"This is the worst scale that I have ever used. It is not accurate. I have stepped on the scale and weighted myself and then stepped on the scale to double check the reading and have gotten readings that are as much a 30 lbs. difference, taken within minutes of each other. I would not recommend this scale to anyone and if you get it for a gift, return it as fast as you can."
1,Scale is neither precise or accurate,"Precision is defined as the ability to get the same measurement every time. Accuracy is defined as the ability to get the correct measurement. This scale is not accurate, and it pretends to be precise.It seems that as long as you apply somewhere around the same weight repeatedly within a limited amount of time, you will get the exact same reading. However if you wait about 10 minutes, and apply the same weight you will probably get a wildy different reading and again get that reading over and over until some kind of internal timer resets.Another way to get wild readings is to switch off weighings between two people with large weight differences. We never get the same individual weight twice, with discrepancies swinging over a 6lb range.Although I can see benefit of providing a ""stable"" weight to the weight-obsessed, those of us who want the truth are frustrated."
1,Junk and lack of Customer service,I thought when I bought this that both name brands were good to go with... WRONG. The scale never gives the same weight twice... no matter if you step on the same place or not. I have written two emails to Conair and they don't answer either one. If the cheap dial scale is right then the so called precision scale is 13 pounds lighter... not too PRECISION in my book.Buy something else!!!
1,worst scale ever,"This is really the worst scale. It is extremely inaccurate. Everytime you stand on it, it gives a different weight.THE WORST THING is that you dont have to tap on it to make it work. You literally have to BANG YOUR FEET on it to make it start. The scale is not stable(one end is higher than the other) and so when you bang it, it makes a really loud sound.I tried keeping the scale on my carpet (in my bedroom) and then tried weighing myself and it showed my weight around 80 pounds less. ALL of the other scales I have used work on carpet AND on floor.this is the worst thing i have ever bought and its not even worth 1/10000th of a cent."
2,Not precise at all,"I agree with some of the other reviews. The precision is lacking. Repeat weighings show the same weight, unless you give it a few minutes. Also, I do a test involving a glass of water...about 12 ounces plus the weight of the glass is 1 lb. If I weigh myself before holding the glass, then after, I should weigh approximately 1 lb heavier holding the glass. Well, this scale showed the EXACT same weight, before and after. Not even .1 lbs higher. It's going back to the store tomorrow.I would recommend the Health-O-Meter Doctor's Scale...Weight Tracking Scale. I got it at Walmart for less than $30 and it not only gives an accurate reading, but it also is consistent, and when I hold a glass of water that weighs a pound, it shows that my weight is 1 lb higher!"
1,what's with the rave reviews?,"I don't understand why this book got so many stars on this site. I groaned aloud at some of the dialogue and found the characters one-dimensional. The female characters are poorly drawn and the dialogue throughout is weak. I felt like one minor character after another was introduced every few pages or so and had little to do with what there is of a plot. I expected a quirky, refreshingly funny novel but felt like I was stuck at a bar having dull conversations with its regulars. It's Seinfeldesque in that it's much to do about nothing, but lacks the humor that could have ensued. To be fair, the premise did have potential, but the author deserved a better editor perhaps to guide him to cut more. I found myself pausing to read the author's bio and thought ""A-ha...it's a first novel."" I've never written a review before but felt misleaded by the rave reviews on this site and wanted to offer some balance."
1,i think these reviews are written by the author's friends,"this book is horrendous. nothing makes sense: the characters make strange decisions( if eric is so smart, sign up at a local college, raise your illegitimate child, and move on), characters are introduced for no particular reasons( grampa jim?), and certain scenarios don't produce the reactions they are meant to produce (the whole town thinks eric is rooting for the home team to win, so what? why is eric angry about that? he should be grateful that they don't think he's a destructive alcholic.my book group read this book based on these over inflated reviews and i'm angry. The whole point of this is to tell the honest truth so people can make good decisions, you people have wasted my time."
5,Deftly examines the disaster & the terrorist group connected,"In 2004 schoolchildren were massacred in a horrifying murder scene in Russia which shook the world and was led by one Shamil Basayev, leader of the terrorist Wolves. Paul Murphy's The Wolves Of Islam: Russia And The Faces Of Chechen Terror deftly examines the disaster and the terrorist group connected to it and other terrorist actions in the region, providing the author's counterterrorist insider's viewpoint in analyzing the faces of Chechen terrorism and Islamic insurgent forces at work in the region. The result is an impressively involving, frightening, informative, and thought provoking survey of immense importance."
1,sensationalistic nonsense,For any one looking for a nuanced analysis of the complex Chechen conflict stay away from this sensationalistic nonsense. The book is an anti-Chechen diatribe with no footnotes that repeats every fiction about the Chechens as 'fact.' For example the author over and over again repeats the Kremlin propaganda that the Chechen highland warriors are fighting for Al Qaeda. This despite the fact that the Chechens have been fighting to expel the Russians from their ancient homeland since the late 1700s (hundreds of years before Bin Laden). This book is dangerous because it reduces the Chechen tragedy to an AL Qaeda subplot. The author deliberately misleads his audience with this shrill work that resembles pro-Kremlin propaganda. Anyone looking for a serious work on the Chechens should read Sebastian Smith's Allah's Mountains or Khasan Baiyev's the Oath and skip this footnoteless tedious dross.
1,Poor quality and terrible support,"I bought ER586HT English/Russian from Ectaco and it was inoperable out of the box. Some buttons did not work at all. The store only had 7 days return policy so I had to bring it to the Ectaco store in Queens, NY. I was told they would call me within 2 weeks. It took me 5 weeks and multiple calls to get a replacement which... had the same problem. Now it has been 3 weeks again, no word from Ectaco.Summary: good product idea, very poor implementation, absolutely the worst warranty and customer service I have ever seen."
1,WARNING! Beware of this company!,"I purchased an Italian-English dictionary from this company. The dictionary...was actually mediocre in functionality, but more importantly for the purposes of this review, it was faulty. After having bought and tried new batteries on three separate occasions and spending hours trying to get it to work, I wrote to the company. I explained my situation, and asked them for a solution. The experience thereafter was terrible - I was shuffled from one person to the next, to the next, and was finally and ultimately referred to the person I initally contacted! She ignored my communications, and simply referred me to a person I had communicated with before. In the end, the faulty dictionary sits on my desk at home. Beware! This company deserves to go out of business. Do NOT purchase their products, keep your money, and avoid a bad experience."
3,Cute but you may need a Glue Gun,"These are very cute shoes, but there is a chain of metal links on the shoe to give it the great decoration. Unfortunately, the metal links will separate from the shoe. You'll need to reattach them with super glue or a glue gun if you want them to stay on."
1,"Incorrect information and a one-sided story. What is this, Sgt Rock?",I read this one recently and was shocked by the content. Kubert makes this war in Bosnia into a one sided black and white affair. The Serbs are evil killing machines bent on getting back Bosnia for the Serbs. Kubert even goes as far as blaming the destruction of the Mostar Bridge on the Serbs. They weren't even involved in that conflict!This book reminded me of the comics from the 50's and 60's with the depiction of evil Japs and Krauts. Stay away from this one.If you want a great comic about this horrible conflict check out Joe Sacco's work. He tells the story from someonewho has actually visited Bosnia.
2,Not Polarized,Wiley X Blink Model 555 are not Polarized. I bought a pair recently from Amazon and found out the hard way. If you are looking for Aluminum Gloss Frame Blinks with Polarized Silver Flash lenses the model number is 558. The seller (Sunglass Express) in the case of my order just blamed Amazon for improper item description and told me to complain there. Since then Sunglass Express has removed there posting.
5,great glasses great price,"These are a bargin. Wileyx's are good saftey glasses.The glasses are a good deal, the cost is great. The style is exactly what they show."
2,I needed to read it!!!,I'm not sure I should have bothered. It's much like all 19th century writing I've read -- verbose and it takes forever to get to the point.I guess in those days life was slower and you could spend 48 hrs reading a novel. I liked the story but I think I would have enjoyed it more as a Classic Comics version.
5,Love Tolstoy's novels,"Although not my favorite Tolstoy novel, that would be War and Peace, Anna Karenina is great writing and great history. Tolstoy had a way of taking one back to the time and the place, feeling the cold, hearing the sounds and understanding the characters that I don't think any writer has surpassed. Just wait until after you see the movie to read this beautiful book or you WILL BE disappointed in the movie."
3,Anna Karenina,"I got this book to find out if I liked books written by Tolstoy. It wasn't my kind of story I was looking for stories about families, country life something with a good moral backround. I read it but don't intend to read it agian. It might be something someone else might like, but not me."
2,Took too long to get the book,"It took much too long to receive it. Assuming the first book was lost a second one was sent. The first book finally arrived in good condition three weeks later, the second one came in shortly after, it looked like it came out of a dumpster. I returned the second book. I am reading this book, because the book club I belong to is reading it. I find it very complicated and hard to follow. I have just watched the movie and find it also mixed up, however it makes the book a little more understandable."
5,Beautiful Handbag,"The picture and description just can't capture how amazing this bag is. From the soft red leather to the lined interior, every part of it screams luxury and style. My husband bought it for me for Christmas and it was the best gift I received because it's something I really wanted but would never spend the money on for myself."
5,PEPPER HOT!!,"The tape was hot! College break international broke all the rules of the game. I should have known it was fire when it had Uncle Luke on the scene, next year Cancun the place for me. Who's this director? I mean he's everywhere. This tape had all the baller's & interviews with Ray Lewis, Big Boi (Outkast), Vince Carter and even Cedric the Entertainer. My eyes got tired seeing some many fine _ _ _ women in bikinis. I can't believe some of the things they let guys do, or did in front of the camera. Yo if you get this tape hide it from your girl, naw hide it from your home boys because theyll creep it from you."
5,All the guests loved the cake,Perfect for the party- impressive packaging- arrived on time- enjoyed by all of the dogs- recommend for any dog party!
5,LoveIt,"I loooooove this product. I have never received as many compliments as I receive when wearing this.Not overpowering, just sexual."
1,"this is so fake,not lasting and not even close to the original,too much money for that","i spent too much money for that,not even close to the original,not lasting,that so called fragrance is so fake,i am soo disappointed..."
5,Pat Rocks!,"This DVD is so good yet so funny to watch this Europian audience watch Pat play.They obviously do not KNOW his music and they are sitting there like they are watching Lawrence Welk or something.Pat however ROCKS and proves that he needs to be in the TOP bands with only 3 musicians.Great voice and great playing, Come back Pat PLEASE!"
3,Deafboy review,Great - not up to expectations!! A little too old even though I was aware of that. The Venue could have been better.
2,not good,"I have known something about Lie groups and Lie algebras (I have already read first 5 chapters of ""Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations"" by Brian C. Hall ) and wanted to combine it with the applications in physics. When I encounter this book, I looked at its content, I thought that I should read it to understand the relation between group theory and physics. But it disappointed me for the following reasons:(1) It lacks of mathematical precision when it is really needed. (There is even a uncomplete definition eg. ""reducible representation"" on page 45).(2) The relations between physics and representation theory is not directly presented. I have passed hard days to understand the relations and finally read this topics from other books.Therefore, it is very hard to study this book without a teacher. If you will study this subject alone, it is good to begin with the lecture notes (maybe I should say book) by Dimitry Vvedensky at http://www.sst.ph.ic.ac.uk/people/d.vvedensky/"
2,"Covers a lot, but not well","This book sucks. My professor chose it because it covers both lie and point groups, and includes special unitary groups, but when I talked to him about not liking the book, even he agreed that it was a poor choice. The wording is hard to follow and the examples are incomplete. It doesn't go through proofs rigorously. I've had to refer numerous times to other books for clarification.Group Theory and Its Application to Physical Problems (Dover Books on Physics and Chemistry)is much better."
5,Excellent MS Office,Microsoft Office 2000 may be the best version made. Works with Windows 95 through Windows 7. Is much more compact than later versions.
3,This program may confict with Windows 8,"The program is a little buggy, but this could be caused by the fact I'm using Wndows 8. It locks up the system and I have to give it a hard boot. Otherwise it's funtionality is better than the newest version of Microsoft Word, which I refused to purchase with my new laptop.. Check back in a little while. I'm going to re-install 2000; maybe this will correct the problem."
5,phenomenal!!!,"this is the most informative guidebook to paris i've ever come across! i've been there numerous times, and there is no book that gives more of an ""insider's view"" of this beautiful city. don't hesitate to go out and buy this one--it's a keeper!"
5,GREAT,"THESE ARE THE BEST GLASSES. Can't beat the price. Easy to grip, stable, strong, and fit in dishwasher easily."
4,Good,This was good -- a little academic and formal but it did the job I wanted it to do -- it informed me of the background of a local artist that inspires me!
2,A turd of a translation.,"Not the greatest translation of Jarry's masterpiece.As a Dover thrift edition, it is thrifty and cheap. . . you get what you pay for.I would recommend the Cyril Connelly/Simon Watson Taylor version in it's place."
5,"Mozambique revisited, fifty years later","Having spent my teenage years in Mozambique during the 1950s, I've always felt a strong affinity for Mozambique and its people. I read Finnegan's book with a heavy heart, finally piecing together the puzzle of what has become of the, ""Terra de boa gente"", the land of the good people. Finnegan's book is amazingly sensitive and intelligent. This is a book built on a foundation of deep insight, patience and great scholarship. Through Finnegan's incisive reporting, I was transported back to this ""harrowed"" land down to the smell of the wood fires. Not having been in Mozambique since 1968, Finnegan re-kindled my interest and wish to re-visit this challenged land and to see it again for myself."
3,A complicated War,"Author visited the country in 1992, after the war. I was there in 1994 and the book did help me understand much of what went on. It is well written. On the other hand one will need an interest in this part of the world to find this interesting reading."
3,Admiral Brim battles at the front for life and freedom!,"The sixth book of the Helmsman continues to follow Wilf Brim, Admiral of the Imperial Fleet in the same vein as C.S. Forrester classical works. Life and death in the Imperial Fleet is center stage upon which Baldwin builds the continuing career of Brim.As a middle book in the series, it is prone to all of the shortcuts and assumptions a leading book does not have. But to fans of the Helmsman series this provides more of the same excitement and facination of the originals. Though some of the descriptions have now been used at least six times previously, one can skim over them and continue to watch as Wilf Brim fights for right, and his daughter.A good progression of the Helmsman series with some mature descriptions of Wilf's love life. Probably a pretty boring book for anyone not already familiar and anxious to see how Wilf Brim lives his live 'In Harms Way"""
4,More WWII story made into good space opera,"When we last left The Helmsman in Book #5, he was very busy defending Avalon against the League, AKA the battle for Britain. Now in book #6, our hero is busy defending Sodeskaya (the Bears) against the League. Very much out of WWII and updated to a very classic space opera."
3,"Useful item, kind of","I , too thought this would be a little bigger, but it fits the description. The three long vertical spaces are good for scissors, pens, etc. The two top wells are great for paper clips and other small items. But the six swing-out storage bins are small in width/length and very shallow. I could not find anything to put in them. Everything I needed to have handy was either too long or too tall to fit. I ordered another desk caddy that is a bit larger and has larger bins. I'll use this one someplace, but it is not very useful if you want someting to keep all of your supplies at hand on your desktop."
4,Satisfying,"Unlike the another reviewer here, I don't consider a work of erotica on the same terms as, say, the latest bestseller. I don't consider it in light of a classic by DH Lawrence either, although the setting and mood of Ironwood could be more readily compared to something by Lawrence.The point is, whether one judges a book of erotica in literary terms or not, the bottom line is that one reads erotica to become aroused. If the subtlties of style and how well the writer has dealt with the cliches of the trade matter to you, you should pay close attention to the other review."
2,Far From Being Up To Par!,"I've been a big fan of Richard North Patterson's books over the years. Some of his books are among my all-time favorites. However, Protect And Defend is a a far cry from being among his best. As a matter of fact, this book falls near the bottom of the pack. Instead of being focused on creating an interesting and compelling story line with well-developed characters, for which Patterson had previously been noted, Protect And Defend is much too focused an expounding (ad nauseum, at times) on the issue of abortion, and does so at the expense of a rich plot. Too often I found myself skimming through the pages in order to search for the ""story."" Unfortunately, this task became too tedious and unrewarding, and I had to give up on the book about about two-thirds of the way through. Unless you have a burning desire to read a treatise on the pro-life/pro-choice issue, I'd suggest that you skip this book."
1,A BIG waste of time,"This book stinks. It serves as nothing more than a pro-abortion platform, consisting mostly of contrived arguments pro and con, which are always won, you guessed it, buy the much more thoughtful and compassionate pro. The rest of the book merely wraps around this platform in an attempt to present the book as something other than the author venting."
4,Protect and Defend,"I am most iimpressed by Patterson's ability to interweave not only subplots and allied stories but also the past and present, coupled with all verbal tenses while doing so. Perhaps the finest achievement of all, moreover, is his ability to present both sides of an adversarial issue so persuasively, while all the time being very informative and educational. Doing all this while simultaneously maintaining supense, and allowing the reader to clearly form his or her mental image of the characters and the milieu is quite masterful. I have learned that to either read or listen to any of Mr. Patterson's work that is abridged, is a definite mistake."
3,Read the other books,"Being a major Patterson fan and having read all the books, I would say that the reason his books are so good is that he combines a great plot with excellent character development. So at the end of the book the reader feels like they know the main character very well. In Protect and Defend, Patterson, focuses on several characters (no single main character unlike in all his other books), the future Chief Justice, the President, the two Senators, the 15-year old girl, etc. So he's unable to do something that has made all his other books so successful, really delve into the characters and their backgrounds. However two of the characters have been thoroughly explored before, in what I think are his two best books (No Safe Place & The Final Judgement), so for anyone, who wants to read this book, I would recommend that they read the other two first."
3,a good read,"Richard North Patterson knows how to write. This novel is different from many of the others that I have rad of his but it is nontheless a good read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,not a grabber but still worth reading!,A great book but not a fantastic thriller. It looses its punch towards the ending. I could have thought that the author would have at least let me guess until the ending.
5,I couldn't put the damn thing down,"Richard North Patterson's story telling ability continues to amaze me. His books are always thought provoking and page turning at the same time. This one might be his best ever.If you want to better understand the workings of our legal system, the minds of pro-life and pro-choice advocates, and the workings of our mostly incomprehensible political system, read this book. Sounds boring? Not on your life. Be prepared to lose some sleep in favor of reading this timely work of what could easily be NON-Fiction! And you might as well buy it now. I got it from my library, read it, then immediately ordered my own copy!"
5,"Exciting book, given the current state of politics","I love Richard N. Patterson's books, and this one was no exception. I was taken in immediately and didn't want to put it down. The process of confirmation was very interesting and makes me wonder how much of the back room dirty dealings actually go on. Probably more than we, the voters, ever know about!! The process that Mary Ann had to go through to get an abortion for a ""nonviable"" fetus was horrible, at best. Regardless of your politics or stand on abortion, this is an excellent book. I look forward to his next book."
4,Protect and Defend,"Coming from Zimbabwe I, unfortunately, was unable to comprehend some of the political issues in this book so ended up a bit lost between the Senate and the Supreme Court etc etc. Be that as it may, I thoroughly enjoyed this book especially the issue of abortion coming from different angles, although I felt the author favoured pro-choice.One small criticism, it would appear that the gestation period of Marlene Brown's baby rivaled that of the elephant!!"
2,Too Preachy,"I'm a Richard North Patterson fan and looked forward to this book. What a dissapointment! The subject matter was interesting but the characters preached their views like a pastor on Sunday morning. The book could have been 100 pages shorter and still contained the same action and made the same points. I haven't given up on Patterson, but I hope he returns to his terse writing style next time."
1,intolerance speaks,"At the end of the book, Patterson writes that the 2 largest pro-life groups did not respond to his request for information. They must have read the manuscript and realized how hopeless it was. Patterson goes to great detail in investigating the pro-choice arguments but litters the opposite side with the standard southern, white, male, close-minded stereotypes. His blame of lack of research on the pro-life groups is lame and without support. He should have spent some time trying to understand the mindset of conservatives and pro-life advocates and he would have been much more successful in articulating this difficult subject. He ends up with the tired liberal picture of being tolerant of anyone who does not believe in absolute truth. And intolerant of anyone who does. He could have done so much better."
4,"strong work, excellent research but needed editing","This was my first exposure to Patterson's work and I was very impressed. His knowledge of the dynamic and process of politics makes this a compelling read. His presentation of the contentious debate about Women's Reproductive Rights is very fair. My only quible is that the book is just too long. When a sentence would have worked, he gives us a paragraph. When a paragraph would have sufficed, we get a chapter. A tighter narative would have given greater momentum to the last third of the book."
3,ok,"This is decent as a thriller, but it is a bit too polemic toward a liberal bent. My theory is that writers and actors are so often liberal because they never have to face the real world. They face a word processor or a movie camera. If you want a good straight thriller with no political agenda, try Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE."
1,Protect and Defend What?,"I am a loyal Richard North Patterson reader, but he has lost me here. This book is nothing more than a left wing diatribe. He puts forth no effort to show the opposing side in any kind of favorable light. For the same reason, I put aside the new Clancy book because it was a right wing diatribe! Defenders of Patterson will say that he took the extreme view as an artistic tool or was playing devils advocate. The degree to which he goes to paint everything republican and conservative as jaded and sinister belies that argument. It's too bad he didn't take some very intriguing issues and paint them with a broader brush. He could have created a truly evocative work. As it is it's just tripe. One reviewer noted the extensive research and the impressive acknowledgements. Look closely at those acknowledgements and you will see clearly where his point of view is located Sadly he is protecting and defending a one-sided point of view."
1,Predictable and Disappointing,"That Patterson is a gifted writer is unquestionable. That the word pictures he creates describing the characters, however, leaves no doubt who wears the white hat. Patterson paints with too broad a brush, and falls back on over-used, tired stereotypes--radical right wing, far right, etc. How refreshing it would be to see a writer use equally descriptive phrases as far left or radical left wing describing the other side! Could it be then, that most writers belong to this second group?Therefore, I take umbrage with those who claim Patterson portrayed a balanced view of the issues he attempted to describe in his book. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Patterson's political agenda shines through this work and much of the information he portrays as truth, is as fictional as his characters.The ending is as predictable as Patterson's political bend."
4,popular fiction at its best,"Well crafted, well written, intelligent legal thriller, with intriguing larger-than-life characters (including a noble, heroic Republican who, a la John McCain, survived two years in a POW situation). As a moderate Republican who is pro-choice but very squeamish and conflicted about partial-birth abortions, I do think this novel deserves to be judged on much more than its own politics; right-wingers who condemn the novel without even reading the thing (and I'm sure there will be many) do themselves & us a disservice and waste Amazon space."
5,"Intriguing, informational, and entertaining",One of the best books I have ever read....relevant to today's political and philosophical conflicts. This book captures your attention from beginning to end and on after the last page is turned.
2,Well written but VERY biased,"I have read most of Richard North Patterson's books and enjoyed them greatly. This one is equally as well written but I can't get past the obvious pro-choice slant, to the point where I can't finish the book. That he voices his opinions is fine, but I feel as though I have been beaten over the head by his villification of the pro-life movement. I feel also that I have been misled, as the previous Kerry Kilcannon book did not have such an obvious slant."
2,Propaganda with a tired ensemble cast,"It's disheartening to see such a sensitive subject propped up on a tired set of characters. Hollow men and women who seem to be every liberal's ensemble cast for political ""works of art."" From The Contender, to West Wing, to Mr. President, to Protect and Defend, their faces are getting old - worse, predictable. Welcome to the town of left leaning fiction, where all the enlightened are Democrats, where all the evil are Republicans, where the strong are single liberal women, and the misguided are Christian or fathers (or both). This is fireside reading for the NOW gang - for the rest of us it's just kindling. This seems to be something akin to political ""talking point"" fiction rather than a unique, refreshing point-of-view. I offer two stars for medical and legal technicalities, which one hopes are accurate. Otherwise, this reads like a party platform."
1,His Worst Book By Far,"If you like two boring semi-related plots revolving around wordy, poorly constructed prose, then this book is for you. Patterson is off here. His previous books have had good themes and real characters. This book uses a theme and legal detail that he just can't manage to articulate into an interesting book. Save your money here."
1,far left bias,"The author's leftist political bias is far too pronunced for an objective reader to enjoy this story. If you're gullible enough to embrace the political left's views on these issues (abortion, constitutional construction, campaign financing, etc.) you will likely find this book to your liking. On the other hand, if you are a conservative and a realist you will quickly become bored and perhaps angered."
1,Disclaimer! Amazons scale requires this book to be overrated,"A work can be slanted, biased, and intellectually compelling, but not here. Patterson's CONTRIVED PROPAGANDA for the feel-good masses should be a disappointment for all admirers of his early novels.How do you create a book Bill Clinton calls a must read? Lift characters from current events, vilify mainstream opponents of your views, and white wash your own extremist positions. Go to far and you end up with, as an earlier reviewer notes, a Masters and Killcannon... ""so saintly and self-righteous, they are nauseating.""If you're comfortable with the views of gun violence and reproductive rights advocates like Patterson, that to use weapons to defend your family and your life is wrong but killing partially delivered babies is right, buy this book."
4,Another Compelling Novel...,"Richard North Patterson has an acute ability to develop characters and cultivate a suspenseful plot. This is a controversial book regardless of your viewpoints of abortion, politics, and Republican / Democratic roots. If you agree with Patterson's point, surely, someone else will disagree in opinion. Our country has been divided on these issues for decades.Aside from championing his positions regarding the obvious, this novel is well written, well conceived, and charged with suspense throughout. How would this book read if Patterson choose to stay on the fence regarding these issues?Taken at face value, Protect and Defend is a novel worth reading, whether you agree/disagree with abortion or slant toward conservative or liberal beliefs."
3,"Good storytelling, too one-sided","Richard N. Patterson is my favourite writer of thriller and courtroom stories. I have read most of his books without a single dissapointment. Even so, I have to rate this book with 3 stars: the average of a good storytelling (5 stars, as always)and a biased approach to the issue.I am spanish, and my knowledge of american politics is poor. However, in this book, I came to the impression that all the good (intentions, actions, principles ...)came from one side. All the bad, from the other. Parents & republicans are so badly treated that, out of justice, I finnally found myself joining their side (even though I am son & liberal!).Even accepting that most of republicans could be dishonest people, I cannot buy that all democrats are the highly-principled and righteous people depicted in this work.Anyway, thank you very much Mr. Patterson for the hours of entertainment your books provide me and hope the next one is a bit more unbiased."
1,Potboiler,"This book sees virtue only on the side of the abortionists and sees demons only on the side of those who oppose abortion. The plot is fine; too bad Richard North Patterson can't write! His characters are cardboard cutouts who speak to each other not as normal people do, but like they were all reading out of encyclopedias. Patterson never lets an ordinary word serve when a six bit word can be used in its place. Instead of showing you, he tells you. Appalling writing! And it's obvious he is not a lawyer (or never practiced law, if he is) because his courtroom scenes are laughably bad: Each character who is a lawyer gets to give long speeches phrased as questions. The witnesses get to give long speeches phrased as answers. Not the way any courtroom I've tried a case in works! Save your money for a good author's books, like Alan Furst's."
1,enoughs enough,"I have read almost all Of RNP's books and have enjoyed them very much. RNP tries as so many today try to do............to make the liberal look saintly, and the conservative the brother of satan. I have had enough with writers, media portraying conservatives as a bunch of red necks...............no more will I buy this left wing garbage!"
1,Simple minded drivel,"Women: GoodMen: BadFathers: Very bad. Either abusive, dictatorial, drunken or philandering or some combination of the above.Democrats: Compassionate and thoughtfulRepublicans: Cruel and self-absorbed (If you need help identifying a Republican he likely has a Southern accent)Children: Something to be disposed of before they hurt you or ruin your career. Abort them give them up for adoption if theysurvive or return they'll either die in a car crash or guilt you to death.Sprinkle in characters with first names like Aly,Chad, Kyle, MacDonald, Travis, Kerry and Clayton and you have a Blue States bedtime story."
4,Great book to take on a long plane flight,"As a nervous flier, I always seek out books that can't be put down for long plane trips. Protect and Defend served that purpose perfectly. A page turner if ever there were one, I just had to read it until done. When it was over, I wished it wasn't. The writing style is somewhat pedestrian and the characters are not well developed. So what carries this book? The plotting and the clash of ideas. A roman a clef in which every character seems to have a real life corollary I found it utterly fascinating and authentic. I felt he portrayed the abortion issues, both legal, medical, and ethcial, with surprising depth. A good read!"
3,"First 2/3 not great, last 1/3 great","I read this immediately upon completing the first book in the series, No Safe Place, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Without giving away anything, one of the themes in No Safe Place dealt with abortion. I started reading Protect and Defend and was disappointed to find out that this again was going to be a theme.Not just a theme - the major theme.The paperback edition was about 590 pages. The back cover emphasizes that this is a Kerry Kilcannon book. Except more than half focuses on an abortion rights trial in which Kilcannon has nothing to do. I'm guessing most of the first 400 pages primarily dealt with that, with a subdrama of him nominating someone to be the new Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.The last 190 pages were great - I couldn't put it down. That was when Kilcannon was one of the dominant figures. The abortion case was just far too overdone and dragged.The last 190 pages were 5 stars. The first 400 were a 1 or a 2, hence the 3 star rating."
4,"Politics, human interest and morality","I'm not a polital book reader overall but some do strike my interest. This one has many positive aspects going for it. Politics and the background that lies behind the votes in the Senate. Law and what goes on in the courts. What a struggle it can be for someone with virtue that just wants to do the right thing but may have made choices others don't agree with. Also that not all issues, like abortion, are cut and dry.This is not a quick read but it is an enjoyable read. I highly recommend it."
5,caro's views,"Protect and Defend is so timely that it frightens. I is a necessary inquiry into moral delimmas far more compelling than a mystery novel. Patterson applies ideologies to specific situations. He is persisent and his probing is painful. A reader may feel empathetically injured regardless of belief. This is not an ""easy read""--it is a ""high read""--just like life. Everyone should read this book."
4,Another Winner From Patterson,Richard North Patterson has written another amazing book. He has managed to take a subject that is controversal and complex and turn it into an amazingly compelling novel. I disagree with those reviewers that have stated that Patterson sides only with those characters that support abortion. Patterson does a great job of presenting both sides of the debate while walking a tight rope between facts and preaching. He never crosses over that line and he manages to engage the reader with yet another well constructed legal/political thriller. The characters are well drawn and the many sub-plots as always ultimately come together to a very satisfying conclusion. This book is the very definition of a must read. Don't miss it.
1,Confusing Maps!,"We found the maps and hiking times listed for destinations very inaccurate. The description of the trail routes lack detail and can be very confusing. One of the hikes we did in Boliva was the Choro Trial. This is ONE of the 3 Inca Trails in Boliva. One would assume that of any treks, this one would have been accurate. Not the case. If you are looking for a guide book to help you plan your treks in Boliva and/or Peru go with the Brant Guide book."
3,Limited variety of trekking options,"A good guide for longer trekking options. However, most of the are located in the same area. Could be better if the book had sorted them based on lenght and difficulty. For someone who is only going to trek, think it has a some great advice. However to get a little bit of both tourist trails and hardcore trek, I would not recommend this book"
1,A waste of time,"Don't bother buying this book, it is no good. Inaccurate maps and descriptions and smart-ass writing style."
4,One for the Backpack,"Yossi Brain's Trekking in Bolivia is an excellent book from a superb mountain guide who obviously knows Bolivia and her mountains well. If you're planning on hiking in this magnificent country, then Brain's book is the one for you!"
4,Amazing,"It is a very good book, spetially for basic analytical chemistry. It is difficult to find a book where the student can find a lot of examples very well considered. The acid base equibrium is the basis for understanding ionic equilibrium and sometimes you lose inside the mathematical aspects but forgetting the chemical aspects. I recommend this book, not only for students but also for profesors in the subject."
4,A Fitting end,"The Grand Design was a awsome ending to the series so far. Marco really focused on the characters that were not a important in the first book , such as the Arch-Bishop Herrith. Biagio, did seem to dip in and out of evil and good, but I must say he was very dashing. I did miss Lucyler a bit and some of the other characters,but they are still in there. I don't want to give much away. This book will keep you on your toes."
5,Great textbook!,"I received this textbook really fast and in great condition. I give this seller an A+++ My husband has been copying pages from this book at the library and when he decided to put in two more water wells, this book had to be purchased. The seller was very clear on the ""very good condition"" of this textbook and upon receipt, it was just how the seller stated. It came in perfect condition!"
5,Great Sized Collection,"As a Sharpie connoisseur, I have to admit that I buy these things more often than I get groceries. In any case, this set was great with basic colors that I need.These are the ones that I keep at hand at all times since it's just enough to tittle my excitement from all the bold, lovely colors but not overload in shades of shades. I stick them in a mug and place them on my desk. The perfect palette."
4,Excellent but don't last long enough,"I absolutely love the Sharpie Fine Point markers. I do alot of meditational coloring and these markers have the perfect point and distribution of ink of any moderately priced markers that I have tried. I also enjoy the variety of colors in the 24-count set although I would like to see more light colored markers to replace the overwhelming amount of blacks, dark browns, dark blues & purples but that is just a personal preference. The only problem I have with these markers is that they run out of ink too soon. I seem to be replacing them every few weeks. Other than that I would recommend these markers for older children, teenagers and adults that are using them for fun and not for professional reasons. They are much better than PENTEL ARTS markers and not that much more expensive."
5,80s Colors wahooooo!!!,Sharpies are awesome!I bought this set at the time when they came with some 80s Glam colors and they are pretty cool colors. I wanted to try and color some designs with sharpies instead of paint and maybe even outline with these and then paint.Amazon had the packs and discounted prices over hobby stores. I did go tot he hobby stores to look at the difference between Fine and Super Fine. I bought a pack of each here on Amazon.Hint: have a blank piece of paper under your hand with the marker so if you go over areas you already marked if it isnt fully dried you don't smudge all over.
5,Great Markers,I love sharpies so when i found this on Amazon for this great price i had to have them. The markers worked well and there were so many different colors and they makes perfectly to the thick tips.
2,Poor quality,"These do not seem to be of the same quality of the Sharpies that I have bought individually or in packs of 3. Some of the colors mark OK but a lot of the lighter colors do not mark well at all, almost like they are empty. I usually use these to mark CDs and DVDs but I think I am only going to be able to use half of these or less for the purpose I bought them for."
5,A wonderful story about a boy and his wild pet.,This is a book for young people but my husband and I both loved it. I sent it to my brother and he also loved it. If you like nature and animals it is a book to read.
3,"Flawed, but still enjoyable","I ORIGINALLY WROTE THIS WHEN I WAS ABOUT 19 AND ON A HUGE TODD RUNDGREN KICK. I HAVE SLIGHTLY REVISED IT SLIGHTLY SINCE THEN TO PULL IT MORE IN LINE WITH MY CURRENT VIEW OF THE ALBUM. THE REVIEW MAY STILL SHOW SIGNS OF IMMATURE TASTE OR YOUTHFUL OVER-ENTHUSIASM.This album is lmost on par with it's successor, The Hermit of Mink Hollow, except that it has a bit more of an obvious flaw. As much as I love Todd's recreations of classic songs that fill up one side of the album, perhaps they would have been suited to their own album. Here they just weigh the album down and leave the listener wondering why if Todd was capable of laying down a side of great original pop material he would choose to pad the other half of the album with skillful, yet somewhat pointless, covers. Still an essential purchase for Todd maniacs and not a bad choice for everyone else."
5,Great Read,"This sequel to Sophie Metropolis is a vast improvement on the original (which had good writing but loose plot development). The authors have retained and refined their witty writing, the plot is cohesive, and the characters are just as interesting as they were in the first novel. My only disappointment with this book is that the unresolved plot lines from the first novel remain unresolved.Fledgling PI Sophie seems more adept at finding lost animals than she does at solving mysteries, but she is improving. I especially enjoyed her relationship with Muffy the Mutt, and once again, the descriptions of the Greek community are dead on.This book was a joy to read!"
3,Better than the First,"Okay, so the sequel to Sofie Metropolis is much better. At least the editor seems to be earning her paycheck this time. 'Thomas the Toad' ex husband is only mentioned thirty times as opposed to a hundred.The plot is stronger and I enjoyed Sofie's attempts to serve court papers to the cross-dressing bloke in the pink nightgown. People breaking into her apartment, car troubles, dog troubles, studly man around at the drop of a hat, a funeral home, maniacal granny, dysfunctional folks - all blatantly cribbed from Stefanie Plum...not so much."
3,Mindless reading,"The tone is tongue in cheek, the heroine is a Greek girl who, after catching her husband-to-be with the maid of honor on her wedding day, is now a PI wanna-be and she has a huge crush on a sexy Australian bounty hunter. If you've read Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books this will all sound painfully familiar. In comparison (and how could one not make the comparison?) this one lacks. There is a lot of talk about Greek food and a few somewhat quirky characters but there is no Grandma Mazer here, just an old bat who wants to cook a dog and gives people the ""evil eye"" and it's all a bit bland.The writing is light and breezy making this a truly mindless read. Come tomorrow I doubt I'll remember any details about it however . . ."
2,RIP OFF,"Diry Laudry is the first book I read and from the reviews that's probably a good thing. Janet Evanavich should really look into this situation. Sophie is a very watered down version of Stphanie Plum. I gave it 2 stars simply because I read the whole book, when I wanted to put it down several time. I picked this book up based on review from another web site. For them to say if you like the Stephanie Plum series you will love the Sophie Metro series is a joke. The Sophie books are a complete RIP OFF of the Stephanie Plum series."
5,entirely too funny,"brilliantly witty, you simply must have a good sense of humor to enjoy this film. i redirect you to the VHS version which, although hard to find, is entirely worth it."
3,Jani Lane was in this movie.,"Pretty decent movie. It has its funny moments and there are a few overdrawn rants, but it is all part of the plot. There are a number of recognizable actors, and the one that comes to mind is the late singer, Jani Lane. This movie won't be everyones cup of tea, but is somewhat similar to say Seinfeld as in complaining about ordinary life."
5,"""Great news T. Furrows...""","This is a great movie - a relief to moviegoers who are sick of seeing the same type of comedy done over and over. ""High Strung"" may seem little more than weird after the first time you watch it, but it's wicked funny in a goofy, eccentric kind of way. It basically consists of Thane roaming around his apartment all alone, talking to the camera/you, complaining about seeds in watermelon popsicles, ""the big face"" in Soap Operas, junk mail, stupid contestants on game shows, restaurants/take-out, telemarketers who want to clean his carpets, his children's books writer job (""Bye-bye, Grandma"" is one of his books), etc., etc. Lots of entertaining lines that you can memorize and use to annoy the friends who you make watch it! (Oh, and there's the part about Jim Carey being Death - his face just keeps popping up throughout the movie and he keeps calling Thane to say ""tonight at 8 o'clock"" - you'll just have to watch the movie to see what happens.) In short, Highly recommended."
5,Simply a classic!,"Steve Oedekerk has created one of the best comedies of our time. You'd think that a show about a guy sitting in his room complaining for over an hour would get tedious, but it never does. If you haven't seen this, you owe it to yourself to find a copy of this and watch it. It's absolutely hilarious!Why in the world can't we get this on DVD? On Steve Oedekerk's web site he had continually stated that it was in the works, but that was a few years ago.Please, Email Steve and tell him you want it on DVD! Amazon execs, please call his people and tell him that people want it! We NEED this on DVD. It's not a want, it's a NEED. Life will not be complete until that happens."
4,"A interesting and creative film, for the stand-up comic fan","The film is based in a single man's appartment were he basic complains about the little things in life that bother us all but we never give mention to. The film is basically a stand-up comedy act, due to the fact the the entire film is in the man's appartment and there is only about 3 chacters. Don't be fooled by the cover with Jim Carry on it, his part in the movie is very small and his performance is lacking in all aspects. Odekerk Gives a non-stop laughing performance with witful comedy and a killer ending."
5,Finger Snapping Jazz,"Great jazz sound with an upbeat, funky groove on every track. Bona Fide, on this album, reminds me at times of the funkier side of Gregg Karukas & Bob James on keybords. On guitar, Bona Fide has a vey unique sound; somewhere between Russ Freeman, Brian Tarquin, and Peter White. The bass sounds lot like Gerald Veasely. Thankfully, Bona Fide does NOT go overboard with progammed percussion, which I think has been the worst ""innovation"" in Jazz over the past 10-20 years. If you like upbeat, progressive jazz with a funky groove to it, you will love this album."
5,A Must Have,"I'm listening to this CD right now and if you don't have it, I suggest you get it right now.If you like a mellow funky groove you will like this CD. Great for cruisin' in the car. Summer's coming this will sound good playing in your ride."
4,Mexico is not donkeys and sombreros.... this movie shows you another side.,"I saw this movie while staying in Mexico and it is a stunning, eye-opening look into the class differences in Mexico City. Most American (United States) looks into Mexico involve dusty border towns and sombrero-laiden stereotypes. This shows you another side of Mexico: class differences in one of the largest cities on earth. After 6 weeks in Mexico, much of it in Mexico City, I have a new view of life and of the world.This movie is worth a watch. If you're not fluent in Spanish (I speak it, but I'm not fluent), you will want to use the subtitles, because it's full of slang and cussing in Spanish that would be impossible for a school-educated Spanish-speaker to get a grip of on the first watch."
4,"Fun and cute, but misses the higher point","(...)This film (...) fails to capture the true essence of Easter. Not that I expected it to, for sure! But it might be a good idea to remind your young viewers that Easter is about more than eggs and bunnies, ribbons and flowers. It's certainly a time to celebrate new life...but to celebrate the new life that is given us by God, through his Son Jesus.The film is still cute - although certainly not among the best stock that Disney has produced. I recommend it, but I also recommend something to remind children of the real reason for Easter."
1,This was an entire waste of money!,My children love this movie. The copy sent by Amazon did NOT PLAY AT ALL. Imagine my childrens' disappointment after being so excited to have this again only to find we were ripped off. Worse yet is the fact that my youngest is convinced that he was/is bad because Santa brought him a piece of junk! Thanks a lot!
2,Winnie the Pooh - Springtime with Roo,"This film is disappointing relative to Piglet's Big Adventure or the Tigger Movie because it is difficult for the younger children (who are typically the most enamoured with these characters) to follow. The story is not linear - it requires understanding that the characters are remembering last Easter at certain times. This caused confusion in for our daughter age 3. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, Rabbit's bitterness disturbed our daughter and required continual reassurance that he would be nice again.The songs were nice, the animation fine. Since this film went right to DVD, I expected lower production values, but standards were well maintained. I think the film works well for older children, but was disappointed in it as a movie for our young kids, particularly since Pooh stories are movies that should be among the most accessible to the youngest audience."
2,An Easter Carol,"""Springtime With Roo"" would be better titled ""An Easter Carol,"" seeing as the story is a rip off of the classic Dicken's tale. The storyline is that Roo is very excited for his second Easter egg hunt, but Rabbit decides not to do Easter this year. Instead, he wants to have spring cleaning day. So the narrator takes rabbit(Scrooge) back in time to see the way Easter was last year. Then the narrator shows Rabbit the future and what will happen if he dosen't have Easter.Disney usually has an entertaining story that everyone can get interested in, but they failed to do that with this Pooh film. There also aren't any jokes to laugh at. Only small children will have a good time with this film. The two Easter themed episodes from the popular series ""The Wonderful World of Winnie The Pooh"" which are extras on the DVD are better than the movie itself. The rest of the bonus features are games for little kids.This film won't please your entire family, only little kids.(...)"
2,The most inessential holiday DVD ever,"My 2 1/2 year-old son loves all things Pooh and I guess this is no exception. Unfortunately for him, he won't be watching it again. I don't understand why Disney decided to make an ""Easter"" DVD that had nothing to do with Easter. I mean they could have done a ""springtime"" DVD (as the show's title would imply) with their own made-up holiday, but that's not the case here. I imagine that non-Christian parents wouldn't want their kids watching anything having to do with Christian holidays, whereas Christian parents will likely be confused and disappointed by how this DVD repeatedly tries to explain ""the true meaning of Easter"" without ever even alluding to Christian doctrine. I certainly don't look to Disney for spiritual enlightenment, but neither do I expect from them such pointless and confusing children's fare. Please look to Heffalump, The Tigger Movie, or Piglet's Big Movie for more wholesome, innocent entertainment."
2,Big disappointment,"My 2-year-old daughter loves The Tigger Movie, The Piglet Movie, and the classic Winnie the Pooh videos. Her favorite characters are Piglet and Roo, so I thought this video would be perfect. For a two-year-old, this video has more to do with Rabbit than Roo. The storyline is hard to follow and the ""lesson"" in this story is completely lost on her. I have stopped showing it to her because she has taken to imitating Rabbit's angry and rude behavior - shouting and all. There are enough bad influences out there, why subject her to another one? - especially in characters she admires. Perhaps this video is better suited for older children who can better understand the point of the story."
1,"My kids do not like this video.(""Rabbit the Easter Scrooge"")","Very confusing story line for the typical ""Winnie the Pooh"" child audience. The story is not about Roo. The advertising and the cover information are a misleading Easter Rip Off. It really is about Rabbit being Dicken's Easter Scrooge. This DVD is not the joyous Springtime romp you expect. Rabbit has never been drawn so mean faced and so mean spirited talking as at the end of this movie (before he does an about face). My younger kids couldn't figure it out. I predict this DVD will be available in large quantities used. This is probably Disney's worst Pooh effort and totally out of character from the original A.A. Milne stories although I'm sure the stockholders will give it a glowing review."
3,Region2 - didn't see that!,It would be nice if the Region 2 was in big bold letters as I was unaware until it got to me - thankfully I live in Germany and know many people who can use this DVD -
1,Movie skips midway through.,Movie skips halfway through and I can't see the ending. Tried cleaning the disc but still have the same problem.
1,Foreign produced,Information provided did not indicate that it was in a Eropean format that most US DVD players can not process. Can only wathc this movine on a computer.
4,A Great Movie!,This is a great movie all the way - great story line and great performances. It comes very well recommended to all.
3,"Sweet color, careful at the beach","The color of this thong is beautiful. The fit is excellent if you like a ""fuller"" front that disguises the thong until you walk away. If you are not shy, the fabric is perfect for that bold step after being in the water. My two companions loved the look, but a few other beach attendees thought it was rather revealing. Needless to say, I just loved it. If you love the thong look, but want a more covered front, try the absolutely beautiful ""gay pride"" thongs with the rainbows on the hips. These are simply wonderful and fit like a glove."
3,Disappointing fit,"These gloves simply didn't fit my hands at all. I tried two different sizes. The large size was too short in finger length & hand/palm coverage. the wrist strap connector was too low on my wrist. The XL size was waaay too big to fit snugly on my hand, though the finger length was adequate. The connection at the wrist was too large for my hands and don't allow the gloves to fit comfortably at all. My hands are constantly slipping inside the glove. I've never had a pair of gloves that simply don't fit no matter what size I chose. I like the looks & the feel/texture of the glove, but they are not very practical in terms of fit, grip or comfort."
4,Peak oil primer,"I had already read a great deal about ""peak oil"" before I saw this DVD but I liked it none the less. I showed it to friends to give them a general idea what might happen in the future. I even learned new things, like the fact the tire companies bought up the trolley lines in the early part of the 20th century, and tore them out just to bring themselves more business! Easy to watch and isn't as bleak as some of the books I have read on the subject."
3,Meh. It's okay I guess.,"It is not super clear who the target audience for this film is. If you have never heard of peak oil, there is some interesting stuff to get you thinking, but probably not enough evidence of the problem to really motivate you to properly panic : If you already know something about peak oil, this doesn't bring a lot new to the party... maybe other than the point ""suburbs don't make a lick of sense"" if you hadn't come across that truth.There is a lot more sensationalism and facts that aren't back up... than interesting data or ideas about how to move forward."
3,"Almost all white men, but still good info","This documentary has some very good information, but I was struck by how the movie was dominated by white men. All of the talking heads I saw for the first 35 minutes of the movie were all white men. At that point they snuck in a man from Iran. I wish they wouldn't have diminished the quality of their message with the narrowness of the perspectives and people they interviewed. Peak oil is not just a problem (and opportunity) for white men, but for all of us."
1,left wing porn,"This Canadian movie has a hard time being taken seriously, since so many of the people interviewed move away from the subject of oil and work through their personal issues with the aesthetics and lifestyle of suburban living, SUV, wal-mart, k-mart, etc - quite a lot of screen time is spent on this issue rather than the supposed core subject of ""peak oil.""This film, much like ""An Inconvenient Truth"" would have us all living in soviet style apartment blocs. That's a hard sale. Good luck with it."
2,End of Surburbia,"Very basic program. Somewhat geared to lower level thinking. Turns out to be tome for city planning instead of addressing the major problem, end of oil culture. Did not really enjoy it."
5,Burroughs at his best,"Although Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote many stories about societies of the distant future or past, peopled with anything from prehistoric creatures to aliens, I believe that this is the best representation of his talent for writing fast paced, fun to read science fiction. Although he did not have the advantage modern authors do of capitalizing on recent scientific advances for story material, he draws the reader in, especially in this book, with his ability to create a world of wild imagination and make the reader feel like they are part of the action. This is the book which made me an avid Burroughs fan and encouraged me to read the Mars, Tarzan (and other Pellucidar novels) in their entirety."
5,a glitch in the software,I noticed that I couldnt leave a five star review for the core book or first in the pair. Yes I read the core first and noticed some bonehead gave a three star review claiming he had not read any or burroughs books. It figures that he must have jinxed the review software with such blasphemy. LOL Peace out. Enjoy.
4,Good read,"Love the style and writing of Burroughs. A return to the books I read as a child and young adult in the backwood communities and tourist meccas of Northern Canada. Brings back many fond memories and seems to let the imagination flow freely and to another world, or place and time. A wonderful book."
1,As bad as any other of King's books,"There are so many American authors that are in to write a book and make a buck and King is a perfect example of that. King's books don't bring anything new to the table. He simply repeats what was already said by other authors. Where is the research here? And don't even get me started on the factual errors in his books. I will give King this though: his books are easy to ready as his writing is on a very low level and I see how they can appeal to a large audience that does not have much knowledge on the subject. As for the rest of us that actually have acquired significant knowledge on the topic of European royalties, Mr. King's books are a constant source of amusement and laughter. Cheers."
2,"Entertaining, but trivial...","This book is strictly for summer beach reading: a lengthy gossip session (that is sometimes endless) about people long dead who appear to have led extravagent lives with no purpose. Not one member of the ""Court of the Last Tsar"" comes out of this book with much more than a surface study of behavior. Although there are many ""tidbits"" about the lives of those in the court of Nicholas II, there is no depth to any of the material. If you want to read a light ""history"" of early 20th century Russia, with heavy emphasis on money, sex and social power, by all means, have a good read. For true history, go elsewhere. This is a mishmash of gossip and memoirs taken out of context of the true history of the pre-Revolutionary Russia. I skipped around after becoming boggled down with ""Below Stairs at the Palace."""
5,Review,I received item in a timely manner and in great condition. I would definitely recommend this seller.
3,Good looks but difficult to assemble,This model took hours and hours to assemble. Bought if for my 5th grader's science project. Ended up doing all the work to assemble it. The instructions mention using a hot glue gun at times. That was a mistake due to the paper being so thin and fragile. Simple white glue gives more setup time that's needed. Looks great once it's all complete just takes a lot of effort to get to that point.
4,long overdue examination,"The most insightful reading on Canadian social history I have ever read has been this type of academically researched theme woven into a story, and big as the story is ,this book does not disappoint. I am an artist so it was wonderful insight to see some new Harris artwork in context to boot ! A reason for making this book part of my library was personal to intimate. My parents and their playmates spent an idyllic yet somehow gritty self-reliant youth in the Toronto Silverthorne addition. They intermarried, went off to war together, are still today the best of chums.What on earth could have accounted for it? This book goes a way towards an answer that is long overdue.More detailed , separately appendixed maps would tell a better story"
4,Quick and in one piece,"Got here quick and in one piece, so I'm happy. My only complaint is that on the website when I selected different colors, they didn't show. So I ended up accidentally selecting a color other than the green one displayed. I'm not upset because I actually prefer this black copper, but it could have ended badly. Other than that, good service, thanks!"
5,Sad and Magical and Sensitive,"Night Kites is probably my favorite ME Kerr book and that is saying a lot. This book whisks you away into it's own world, which, while keeping basicaly realistic, still manages to touch the reader in a special way. In the same way, the discription of Eric's feelings towards his brother, and towards Nicky and Jack, are both realistic and transcenant. A must read for both teenagers and grown-ups"
4,Enjoyed the different format,"I enjoyed the fact that novel spanned several centuries, although in some ways I wish it had been split into two or three novels. I still want the details on how Saint-Germain ended up as a slave, and then had half the Islamic army after him.Csimenae was an interesting character, very much an anti-hero to Saint-Germain's ""hero"". I also thought it was interesting that the prohibitions against leaving native earth and enduring sunlight were much worse for her get.As far as Saint-Germain's decision in making her? We've all got to have a few truly spectacular screw-ups. Most of us just don't have our mistakes haunt us for centuries."
4,Some of the best,"This one is different in several respects. Unfortunately, as usual, the story gets slowed down by the endless letters. Scan those and go back to read them later if you must. Without these interruptions, this newest Count book has some surprises and gives our beloved vampire the unusual opportunity to be himself in the company of other creatures of the night. Mostly, Yarbro's die-hard fans will be thrilled at this presentation of the Count using all his powers to combat the evil he inadverdently instigated."
1,Somebody Open a Window!!!,"I've been a fan of CQY since reading Hotel Transylvania when it was first published. I own every SG book in hardcover and read them repeatedly. So why is it that I'm having trouble getting past chapter five--and it was an effort to get that far--in her latest effort, Come Twilight?From the start, there's little there to hold the reader's attention. The characters we've grown to know so well are presented as pasteboard cut-outs, and characters specific to the book have even less dimension. The dialog is stilted and the narrative voice does a great immitation of Charlie Brown's teacher. I find myself skimming even the high action scenes with my brain reading the first three words of each sentence and filling in the rest with ""blah blah blah.""I hope this is just a fluke. Try again, Quinn; this one bites."
3,Not one of my favorites,"I have a been a longtime fan of Yarbro, and have the entire Ragoczy series, but somehow this one failed to fully engage me. The ghoul Rogerio seemed somehow out of character, complaining and disagreeing more that usual with Ragoczy. Or perhaps this is supposed to reflect his earlier character. Perhaps because Ragoczy's relationship with Csimenae was so unusual, not as intimate as usual, I failed to care much about her character.Works by Yarbro that don't earn a 5-star rating from me are rare, so I'm looking forward to the next one."
2,The plot is getting thin.,"Yarbro has developed quite a bit as a writer over the course of the Sanct Germain series. Her characters have more depth, and her sense of place is terrific. Her historical research is impeccable. However, she needs to come up with some different plot lines for the series because the novels have become predictable. The plots all seem to follow the same basic line: Sanct Germain is either already living someplace as a somewhat tolerated/accepted ""outsider"" or arrives and becomes a somewhat tolerated/accepted, he becomes involved with a local woman, he runs afoul of the local political hierarchy, he has to escape to somewhere else--sometimes twice in the course of the same novel. As much as I was intrigued by the picture of Iberia and its history that Yarbro presented, I put this book down before I finished a third of it because the story itself lacked something fresh about the characters or their interactions."
2,Not Her Best Work,"I've been a Yarbro fan since the 1970s and have every Saint Germain book in hardback. This one doesn't even come close. It almost seems like an attempt to become ""Anne Rice-like.""I don't want to give away the plot, but it drags. Yarbro's normal wonderful historical aspects are all but missing.If you want an excellent Yarbro novel of Saint Germain I highly recommend her earlier work, ""Out of the House of Life."""
1,Does it exist?,Ordered this whistle twice. It looks to be perfect for a small child's mouth. Received my order from two different Amazon suppliers. Each sent a rectangular whistle keychain. It was suggested I not order a third as there was no guarantee I would receive this whistle.?!?!?! So guess I wouldn't recommend.
1,WTF,"Not even what I ordered. This whistle looks and sounds like something you'd find in a box of Cracker Jack. About 3 inches long and an inch wide with 2 little holes. Really screechy sound. Meant to be a stocking stuffer for Grandson. He's 4, and my wife says it's not worth the hassle to return. Wish I could give the seller a minus 5 stars."
1,Bait and Switch!,"I ordered 15 of these whistles for my son's fifth birthday party. Like others, I was impressed by the size, design, and quality of these whistles, so I was willing to pay a lot more to get them. However, when they arrived, I got 9 of the whistles as pictured, and 6 that were a completely different whistle, only about an inch and a half long! There was no explanation for the switch, and it has left me scrambling to get appropriate matching favors for all of the kids. Amazon gave me a refund for the six wrong ones and told me to reorder, but I was again provided with the six tiny whistles, which are literally nothing like what is pictured. Terrible experience, and still without matching whistles."
5,Excellent Blu Ray,This DVD met all of my expectations. Excellent video quality and the audio was just as great.....
5,THE FABULOUS CELINE !!!!!!!!!!!,"We have been going to Vegas since 1963 and have seen alot of shows but let there be no doubt that A NEW DAY had to be the most fabulous Las Vegas show we have ever seen. Celine is ""SECOND TO NONE"" when it comes to a perfect voice, showmanship and special effects. She is the absolute best!Kathryn Orsulak Bossier City LA"
4,Overpriced...,"Hey Amazion... Just bought this dvd for $9.99, not $21 + ... Can't you keep you prices down? I do find some bargains on your site but would buy more if you were more in the ball park of pricing..."
2,bad disk,"I purchased on feb 10 ,08 was a great video until recently started hanging up and now will not play at all. I guess no warantee coverage?The second disk plays fine so it is not my player.I guess ill have to purchase another one since I liked it so much and hope it is made better."
3,This show is OK but not Spectacular.,I have been waiting for this dvd to be released for a long time and when it finally was I was not impresed. This is just another concert and great dancers but if you want to see an spectacular show look for Madonna's Blond Ambition or the Confessions Tour.
1,Pretty terrible,"I don't know what the heck happened to Celine Dion! I have these songs from this disk on the regular audio released before, and I love them! The arrangements for the Vegas' life performance are just horrible, no life, no nothing. All is dull, performance is ridiculous, some dumb dancers on the background make you angry. Don't know, but I was very furious that I spent money on this. And I love Celine's music!!! Just not from this disc."
3,Great Music Poor Editing,"I have been to the concert twice. It's Great! Maybe that is why I was so disappointed in the DVD. The music is great, the editing is amateurish at best. The video cuts from one angle to another every one to two seconds. Except when it focuses on Celine, then maybe 5 or 6 seconds. All of the majesty of her dancers is lost in the rapid fire scene cuts. You cannot focus on anything. There is a lot going on on-stage. It is definitely not captured well on the DVD. Great singing, fantastic Celine. Poor editing and video production. Too bad."
3,Kind of Surprised At How Little Stage Presence She Has,"Her music is great of course. The sets are great. The dancers are great. The lights and effects are great. But, I was shocked at how stiff and unnatural she was in her own movements and in her interaction with the audience on this disc. My wife and I actually got uncomfortable watching her. In my humble opinion she is not a great live performer in this kind of big production setting. Buy as many of her CD's as you can. You cannot take that from her, she has a great voice. Skip the high priced Blu-Ray though. 3 stars for the music and the production only."
1,horrible,"Celine Dion remains, as always, one of the worst things to happen to music since major record labels."
2,Celine Dion DVD review,"Even though the product was labeled new, the dvd case was not sealed and the booklet that should be in the case was missing."
4,CELINE DION - A NEW DAY,THIS IS A FANTASTIC CONCERT. HERE IS A WOMAN THAT IS FULL OF GRACE WHEN IT COMES TO HER AUDIENCE AND HER BAND AND A GREAT FULL LADY. I LOVED IT AND SO WILL YOU.
5,Outstanding!,"Having seen this Celion Dion show in Vegas, this DVD puts me right back there. It's outstanding and the ""full access"" portion of it is the most entertaining thing I've ever watched. My entire family viewed it and can't believe how great it is. It's well worth buying and watching over and over again!"
4,Great DVD but nothing like the performance :),"DVD is great. Celine sounds so much better live though. I woul recommend this dvd but if you have teh chance to see her live, do it! She was amazing."
5,Great show,My wife and I went to Vegas to see this show last year and decided to order the DVD this year. Great show.
5,Wow!!,What a Blu-ray!This show is AMAZING. The quality is outstanding!Is the best show I ever watch in my life!Buy it! Celine is wonderful!
5,The DIVA sings !,"Celine is fantastic ! she has dynamic range unparalleled,she has POWER, she has expression, she is sexy and sheis pure performer - I believe whole heartedly she is themost talented singer now living ! I am Male in my SIXTIESand have a great EAR !! Celine is a living DIVA !!!"
4,live in vegas= a new day,"loved the dvd ,only problem the second special features won't play on my dvd player"
5,Great Entertainment!,I went to Las Vegas several years ago with Celine Dion tickets in hand! I was so excited to have planned my vacation around this concert. The night of the concert we got all dressed up and proceeded over to the Caesars Palace Colorsseum. I wondered why no lines as we approach the concert entrance? The man at the door informed us the concert was cancelled as Ms Dion had a stomach bug! I couldn't believe she called in sick on THAT night! I was crushed.I bought the DVD and have enjoyed it many times. I finally got to see what I missed *<:)
5,An exception deal for an exceptional Blu-ray release,"The picture and sound quality of the concert is amazing. I was pleased to discover that it didn't just consist of Celine Dion singing, but also incorporates an incredibly large amount of dancers brought in by the head of the Cirque de Soleil shows. Stunning on all counts.The special feature that is on the first of the 2 Blu-ray discs consists of Dion greeting fans in person from all over the world. On the second disc, thee is a truly stunning special feature is one that runs two hours (longer than the concert on the first disc) and it is the entire Las Vegas show running on stage while we get a backstage view of all the technical and talent sides. Really fascinating! There is also one more featurette called ""Secrets."" The special features are in high def, too, on the Blu-ray discs.They fill this release with so much that you truly feel like you have been to an incredible dinner and ate everything in sight. A must-have Blu release."
5,Great DVD,wouldn't of purchased this DVD if it wasn't on blu-ray but I must say the performances look fantastic if you have a good tv/projector.
4,Guide to the coast of summer,"Throughly enjoyed this well written and researched book. Some of the places I'm very familiar with and others will be new adventures this and subsequent summers. Definitely encourages me to visit new harbors. Also, a lot of fun to have the back stories / history on this area."
5,Great seller,I loved the Sunglasses because they look great and they were very inexpensive. I also loved the fact that I received them quickly.
5,Concise practical information. Impressive case histories.,Dr.Sagan's Entity Possession is written with a matter-of-fact tone that this subject matter deserves. A straight-forward scientific presentation of subtle energy influences without the mystical journey overtones. A must read for serious Energy Healers and anyoneone else that perceives subtle energies.
4,Do Entities Exist? This Book is Very Convincing,"As a publisher of books with similar content (The Sex Connection by Alan Fitzpatrick), I was quite impressed with Dr. Sagan's frankness and thoroughness on the subject of entities. His detailed descriptions and categorizations are very convincing. I do not endorse the therapy, necessarily, but I applaud the author's effort to approach this delicate subject in the face of, I'm sure, some adverse criticism from the medical paradigm in which he works. Thank you, Dr. Sagan, for bringing a ""dark"" subject into the light.The Sex Connection, A Study of Desire, Seduction and Compulsion"
1,The James Taylor Story? Not!,"This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I hesitate to even put my two cents in because I don't want to encourage anyone else to buy this trash- even out of morbid curiosity- but- this is the stuff of supermarket tabloids- if you really want to gain insight into the life and work of James Taylor- look elsewhere. Halperin can't write and his ""quotes"" are so obviously made up this ""bio"" doesn't even pass the straight face test.I feel like I should apologize to Taylor and his family for even reading it. Absolute trash- don't waste you time and money."
1,don't waste your time or money,"This is shameful reporting. Some of the sources were no more qualified than I am as a source about JT's life. Fans, no matter how enthusiastic, aren't a source of biographical information, especially for someone who calls himself an investigative reporter. The writing is choppy. There are lots of typos. The book is repetitious. There are even some factual errors, so I wonder just how much of what the author says is true.Don't waster your time or money on this one! I only gave it one star because there's no way to give 0 stars."
1,I Didn't Like This Book!,"I bought this book because I have been a fan of James Taylor for many years. I didn't think it was very well written. And it also didn't really tell me much of anything that I didn't already know. Oddly, it had the news of James' recent marriage to Kim before the actual wedding took place. How odd."
3,A Bit Too Reverential,"Though there is plenty here about Taylor's well known drug addiction and his tempestuous marriage to Carly Simon, this rock bio still comes off as too fawning. It would have benefited from better sources. Taylor or Simon do not appear to have been interviewed, nor was producer Peter Asher. Instead, we read a lot of boring quotes from fans about how great James Taylor is."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of James Taylor, own over a dozen of his CDs, have seen him in concert numerous times, and had the pleasure of meeting him on Martha's Vineyard. I looked forward to Halperin's unauthorized biography of JT, but was ultimately disappointed. It is poorly written, poorly organized, and unbalanced. Halperin writes more about Mr. Taylor's sex life than he does his music. An entire chapter is devoted to his relationship with Joni Mitchell, and over a third discusses in boring detail his marriage to Carly Simon. Three quarters of the book covers Mr. Taylor's life from the age of 18 to 30 with little on the last 20 years of his life!I give Mr. Halperin one star for the obvious work he put into the book and another star for the little bit of insight I gained into Mr. Taylor's life. For true JT fans who want to learn more about him, I would recommend sticking to the numerous interviews he has given over the years, or better yet, just listen to his music."
2,This isn't the book you want,"Granted, James Taylor is one of the most private of pop stars. The reason there have been few detailed tomes on him is that he is very private, and his friends and family (even ex-wives) are just as much so, respectful of the artist's privacy.Thus, this nice little book is light on details and is a general reference of Taylor's career, going as deep as his research could take him. That's the not so good news.The better news is that another - far more professional and certainly more talented - author has gained access to Taylor and his inner circle of friends and family. That's the one you want, it's here on Amazon, and it's the one you should buy if you really want to learn about the inspirations, the history and the muse of James Taylor:James Taylor: Long Ago and Far Awayby Timothy WhiteSo get off this page and go to that one!"
1,A Difficult Read,"I read this as a casual fan of JT, and a person who enjoys the biography genre. It was a difficult read - Halperin jumps from thought to unrelated thought like a frog hopping from lily pad to lily pad. He considers ""a fan said"" to be verification and documentation of his odd suppositions. In the introduction, he lists people interviewed for the book, yet most of these are never mentioned in the text of the book.The sex, drugs and mental illness themes are harrangued constantly throughout the book, with little to no validation (it couldn't be THAT hard to have found SOME, and it's not worth mentioning the rest.) Misspellings of names, of words and poor grammar is rife.This is a poorly written and edited book...."
1,"Great Artist, Bad Writing","Positive feelings about James Taylor himself are the only reason I can imagine someone giving a positive review to this book. There is certainly a lot of information presented, but most of it is either rehashes of previously published interviews or ""friend of a friend"" stories. The writing style is pedestrian at best, thoroughly graceless and awkward most of the time, and repetitive to an extreme degree, as has been mentioned in many other reviews (so I guess I'm being redundant, too). Even the chapter titles (e.g. ""Joni Mitchell, The Woman He Loved Too Much"") are bad.The publisher and ""editor(s)"" of this mess must only be out to gouge money out of Mr. Taylor's adoring public by being the first to release his biography, since they obviously didn't make the effort to produce a book worthy of the artist or his fans."
1,Fire and Pain,"As a fan of James Taylor for some years, this book was painful to attempt to read. The book is so poorly written and organized that it is difficult to follow. Clearly only a dedicated fan would even try to finish the book. The book is an embarrassment. It is a major disappointment and shame that such a poor effort was published. More emphasis should have been placed on Mr. Taylor's incredible talent and musical growth rather than countless repitition of his sexual exploits. It is of little surprise and less consequence that a music star in the 70s had numerous sexual encounters. It would have been more interesting to hear about experiences that influenced particular songs. My 10 year old son writes better than Mr. Halperin. This book wasted my time and money."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Like others on here, I am a huge James Taylor fan enjoying the chance to have a chat with him after a recent show in a nearby town and getting a photo with him. This book is an insult to the man, his family, his friends and his music. It is so poorly researched, it doesn't say much for the Rolling Stone Magazine Award for Investigative Journalism if they gave THIS author their award. Were they on the same dope James used to enjoy! It is so poorly written, does not flow in anything like a sensible order (and is often incorrect for when events actually happened), is repetitive and is based on supposedly suggested comments. The factual errors are laughable. Don't waste your money on this book! To the author, get Sheila Weller's 'Girls Like Us' and learn how to write a well researched biography."
2,Please don't give up your day job-Mr. Halperin,"I appreciate that someone has attempted to write the Bio of the legendary JT, as he is an amazing, charasmatic artist. No offense, but the writing is terrible. It is repetitive, boring, and Mr. Halperin has interviewed more fans then insiders privy to JT. I can't even finish the last chapter. Readers, wait until the man himself (James Taylor) does his own autobiography instead of a poor ""guesstimated"" version of it by someone who obviously hasn't done his homework. He really must have slept through his writing classes in college. Sorry!"
1,Trite and inaccurate,"I was delighted to find a published JT bio, but Halperin's book is a wasted opportunity and a major disappointment. It is trite, rife with errors, and ultimately favors tawdry gossip over analysis of the considerable substance of JT's songs, musicianship and politics. The author (himself clearly not a knowledgeable fan) relies chiefly upon old press reports, speculation and opinions excerpted from JT fan sites, and interviews with peripheral figures. Not surprisingly, this yields little of value, and the result is neither an informative biography nor a critical appraisal of JT's work. JT (& his fans) deserve a professionally crafted biography and an illuminating study of his art. Sorry to say that this doesn't come close; I'm surprised that it was published."
2,Disappointed,"As an avid reader, I too was very disappointed in this book. Like most people that probably purchased this book, I am a James Taylor fan that was anxious to learn a new perspective on his life and his music. The two stars rating was based only on the subject matter- JT. It is poorly written and organized, the message is unclear, and you must first wade through piles of irrelevant information just to get to the topic at hand- what Shania Twain was wearing to the Billboard awards, for example, has nothing to do with JT's character or life. I forced myself to finish the book, but stopped often to regurgitate my disgust of his writing style to my husband...."
1,JT would HATE it!,Those who liked it must enjoy reading tabloids. After I read it I couldn't wait to get rid of it. I felt guilty because I learned things about JT that I shouldn't know. The folks who are waiting for his autobiography shouldn't hold their breath. One of the reasons I respect him so much is that he guards his privicy.
1,do not bother!,"Fire and Rain: The James Taylor Story This book offended me! It is poorly written, out of sequence, and full of grammatical and spelling errors. If it was Ian Halperin's point to show that he is capable of regurgitating tabloid magazine accounts and conducting fifth party interviews, he was successful."
1,Stinko,"I'm not sure where to begin in registering my displeasure with this poor excuse for a bio. It is so full of typos and grammatical errors it is difficult to wade through but once you do, you realize it wasn't worth the effort.Almost all the info was just copied from previous articles about JT with the exception of the quotes that the author had to have invented, they just ring so false.And while we're on the subject, the amazon five star reviews by readers who supposedly read the book share a very similar syntax with the author of the book. Coincidentally, none of them have names, only locations. Draw your own conclusions but very suspicious.Other than that, I suppose new JT fans might still want to read this book because there is some interesting stuff in here which most long-time fans already know about."
4,James Taylor Rules!,"I have nothing but kind words for this book. For a first attempt to cover the life and times of James Taylor this book did not leave many unfilled holes. It was well put together and very well-written. Indeed, James Taylor is one of the true music legends of our time."
2,What a disappointment,"I was really looking forward to reading this book but hate to admit that it wasn't worth the time it took. Any true JT fan already knows at least 90% of the information included and can recognize the inaccuracies included. I also was particularly annoyed by all the errors - I'm no English major but please -- was this proof-read at all? JT, second only to the Beatles in my book, deserved better."
1,Amateurish and Disappointing,"It is rare that I can't bring myself to finish a book, especially when the subject is someone of such strong interest to me, but this piece of tripe is unreadable. As a high school teacher, I am accustomed to poor spelling and grammar. This book reads like an extended biographical essay by an average high school junior whose notes were poorly organized. I hope my one-star review will help to lower the unbelievable 3 1/2 star average I viewed for this title and prevent some other JT fans from wasting their money."
2,Good...for laughs!,"There are so many reviews here, and the bad ones pretty much have the topic covered. I'll just add that after I read that Carly Simon was flirting and possibly having an affair with Pablo Picasso in 1980 (when he had been dead for nine years) I lost a lot of faith in any of the other facts the book reported. If you have a slow internet connection, then this book might be worthwhile - it provides about exactly the same content you would find on a James Taylor web board."
1,not much truth here,"What little I know about James Taylor and his music is misrepresented here by the author. Many stories about songs written by James are not mentioned and others are interpreted by fans from a website chat. This is research? Also, there is no footnotes to tell where the supposed quotes came from. I could write a book this way. Also, the quotes used in the book are attributed to anonymous sources. This makes it easier to write. It doesn't take much to state things you know aren't true to make a point that isn't true. The book's subject is worthy of a look into his lifes work, but this isn't the book. SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!"
1,"Terribly written, dull, and not proof-read","This was a terribly written book with countless spelling, grammar, tense, and common sense mistakes. There were even words missing from sentences. Clearly no one edited or even proofread this disaster.I learned very little about JT that I didn't already know, despite reading all 261 pages. Thankfully, I borrowed it from the public library and didn't waste a cent on this book.And by the way, I rarely give reviews this negative. But I felt like I needed to warn people before they spent any money on this book."
4,THE BIG BAMBOO!!,"This CD changes up so fast, you'll get whiplash! funny but a little freaky. But seriously...I really liked these songs alot. Some of them could be pop hits, and some are crazy dark, but they all work. There's even a kind of schitzo logic to the way everything jumps around. I think my favorite is the lunar megamix. I heard it on the radio and I was almost in tears I was laughing so hard!! This is a definitely worth buying. Just be brave!!"
1,Beware!,"I'm sure this game is loads of fun...unfortunately, like 80% of the people who bought this game, I cannot play it because my computer's video card is not up to the game's standard. Do not buy this game unless you know for a fact you video card meets the requirements! Though Buena Vista claims it is, this is not clearly stated on the box and it is very misleading. This game should be pulled from the shelves and reprogrammed because there are many, many complaints of it not working! It was a great idea, but some great ideas fail. You will most likely get scammed if you buy this game so I do not recommend purchasing it. It's not worth wasting $20 for a game that won't even load onto most computers."
1,Not Worth the Hype,"I was so excited when I saaw this being released that I ordered it right away. Of course, I checked to make sure my computer fit the requirements. I get the game (and I have a computer that is less than a year old), try to install the game and I keep getting error messages saying that the program would not run because the computer did not meet the requirements! Funny thing is, you then go to another screen for the explanation of what requirements it does not meet and my computer meets them all--and the game still will not install! So I'm out $25, with a game no one can play. Plus, I went to the website for assistance and really did not get any."
1,BEWARE!!!,Buena Vista Games mis-represented the minimum requirements listed on the cover of this game. We have 3 name brand laptops and one name brand desktop. ALL meet the listed minimum requirements and NONE can run this game because they have the wrong video cards. This was a Christmas gift to me from my sons. What a disappointment.
1,BUYER BEWARE,I bought five of these games and not one of the people I gave it to can run it. Now I am out the $100 and all customer service can say is take it back or wait for an unspecified update that may or may not be coming. Don't buy it.
2,Don't buy this game,"My mom bought me this game after I asked for it, and I wish I hadn't. I would consider this game a good one, that is if it hadn't been for the loads of problems I experienced when I tried to play it. When I first got this I tried to install it on my computer and it failed then I tried the laptop and still it failed.I put game away for a while until I got a new computer. I tried to install it for a third time. It failed one test but managed to install anyway.I played the game and it was fun but then I went to get off. But oh wait you can't save the game, at least not where you want to. I had two families; one restarted the game at episode six the other started over from the beginning.I looked on the internet to try to fix the problem and after doing what the website suggested it worked. But when I'm on episode 6 the game crashes at the poker game or time gets stuck at 5:00. It turns out the game is incompatible with Windows 7. So save yourself the frustration, don't buy this game."
3,Play Issues,"Installation was not a problem, but trying to play it is another issue. I try to run the program and a box pops up saying the disc is not an original. I don't know if this happens to other people, but it is ticking me off."
2,Don't know yet. :(,"I love the show and love video games so I have been waiting for years to play this game but didn't have a PC.I bought it when I got a notebook computer but am massively disappointed that it won't play on my computer. It meets all the qualifications except the video card. This game needs a NIVIDA video card and won't even install without one. Amazon really should include all the minimums your computer needs to have to actually play the game.My daughter urged me to return it but I'm hanging on to it in hopes of getting a better computer or, if possible (I'm no computer geek so I don't even know if it is), update or install the video card.I am bummed out!!! The game looks fun as hell from reading the book. I wish there was a PS2 version."
1,Unbelievably boring!!,"Didn't have any problems with freezing or anything, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, this game is not in any way entertaining. I love the show and couldn't wait to play the game, but it was a big let down. I played this game for about 2 hours and got completely bored with it. There isn't any real challenge to this game. You follow their goals and cannot proceed until you do what they want. Completely disappointed."
4,You poor suckers (I am a poor sucker too!),"Mom-If you are like most of us and have an ordinary video card, it wont work! Tried installing it on 4 systems, all with standard up to date stuff and it didnt work. After 3 purchased videos cards I finally got it right! I had to download the list of video cards it would work with but then also figure out why type of video card my system took! Whew. After spending $50 for a video card to play a $10 game I was a bit frustrated but it all was worth it to see my daughter have fun playing the game (not!)Daughter -I think the game was GREAT!!! once you learn the whole point of the game its actually fun you get to design a husband,son, and even you! You mostly get to cook garden and meet your neighbors. The only bad thing about once you were playing was that you have so many goals and it takes a VERY long time to finish it but overall I gave it a 4 star."
1,What they don't tell you,You are not told that if you are missing just one thing on your computer that can't handle this game-guess what you can't play it without upgrading your computer-
3,"Slow, but addictive.","This game does run pretty slow. It takes a few minutes for each scene to load. Sometimes the outdoor trees seem to appear inside my house. Fiddling with the settings fixes the tree problem during the current game, but once I restart it goes back to being a problem. Robbing your neighbor's houses can get you caught easily if your game starts to freeze up while your trying to make your escape. You DO get to seduce all the men on the block (including the female maid!) and no one finds out. The cooking, gardening, and poker mini-games are pretty fun. The storyline definitely keeps you interested. Overall, if you have a little patience while the game loads and lags, it's a pretty good game."
3,Desperae Housewives,"The game is pretty good, I purchased it as a gift, be careful and be sure your computer has thhe appropriate video graphic card when purchasing, the person I purchased it for theirs did not."
1,Would be fun if I could ever play it...,"I received this game as a Christmas gift and couldn't wait to play it. Unfortunately, neither my desktop nor my NEW laptop (less than 1 year old) met the requirements for this game. This is not my first bad experience with Buena Vista - buyer beware!"
3,"Good game, lot's of RAM","This is a really good game, but be prepared to upgrade. Bought this for my wife. She has a 2.3 Ghz pentium, with a 512 mb video card, 512 DDR RAM and 5.1 surround sound card. It takes a good 3-5 minutes to load the game, but once it's loaded it runs fine. My brother bought this game for his wife and had to upgrade the RAM and video card to get it to run. Evidently there are some video card incompatabilities, so make sure you check the web site before you buy."
3,"Fun, but there are problems","I have to say that I enjoyed this game. HOWEVER, I agree with a lot of other reviewers. This game would not run on my computer, even though I had the mimimum requirements. Apparently, I had the wrong brand of video card, even though it was the same specs as what was listed on the box.I was able to install it on my husband's computer and I had a lot of fun playing. However, once I got the final 'episode' the game crashed TWICE. It was pretty annoying having to redo a whole episode over. I did enjoy this game, but make sure you have exactly the right requirements before purchasing or the game won't install."
1,Got my money back!!!,"I bought a new computer (with all the requirements even the upgraded video card), the desperate wives game for my daughter and my neice.However,I could not get the game to work after trying for hours. I was able to download, but then when I try to open the game it goes from a black screen and then back to my desktop. My Christmas dinner was late, due to my determination to make this game run for my daughter. The next day, I returned the computer and did not give the game to my niece.Before going out to purchase another computer for the purpose of one game, I came here instead and you all saved my precious time. Moreover, you saved my young niece the aggravation of getting a gift that would not work (her computer is approx. 5 years old).I returned the opened and unopened games and received a full refund.I really appreciate all of your reviews. I feel better knowing that it wasn't something that I was doing wrong."
1,Before buying this game go to the game website and verify it is the correct video card as only 10 video cards work!,"Well my pc is about 1 1/2 years old and can play any game until this one! I have all the requirements even the upgraded video card. I was able to download, but then when I try to open the game it goes from a black screen and then back to my desktop. I checked the website for the game [...] and only about 10 video cards are listed that work many upgraded video cards don't even work and they have them listed there so just because you have the necessary requirements to play doesn't mean you are going to be able to. I'm out $20 hope no one else has to be!"
2,"Bugs,Bugs,Bugs","I have enjoyed playing this game, but it is so full of bugs that it has been difficult to get as far in the game as I have. I am almost through with the game, but it keeps freezing up and crashing my computer. I give up!!! I really wouldn't waste my time on this game at all, unless you like mediocre graphics and wasting your time rebooting the game because it has frozen up or crashed your computer. Make sure you save your game frequently if you must play this game. They should have never released this game in this condition."
2,Didn't Work,What a waste of money! The game won't save nor will it go past episode 6. There is a patch available but it doesn't seem to have made a difference.
2,stops working,Has anyone else had problems with the game working. I get to the point of Frank locking himself in his room and then it just shuts off. Really would love to finish this game out.
1,I'VE HAD IT!!!,"Well unlike the rest of you, my game actually worked. I failed the system part, and passed everything else. It still worked. This is a fairly new computer and if The Sims can play on this computer with no problems, then this game should not have been a problem. For some reason I could not save the game. I kept getting the message that an error occured...game did not save. And I even installed the patch and it still gave me the same message. And I have had it up to here with shutting down and then going back in the game and having to start over from the beginning. What a waste of money!!! If you are thinking of buying this game do me and everyone else a favor and DON'T!!!!"
1,Poor tech support and extremely high minimum requirements,"I checked the minimum requirements and meet them. However, the game will not work on my PC. When I contacted tech support I was told that they are ""working with intel to resolve the issue, and in the meantime I can return the game or upgrade to a differant video card."" The game is going back and I will avoid future buena vista games."
2,not the sims,I thought it was going to be more like the sims. it's not...but for $9.00 what can you expect.
1,poorly written software,Product was shoved out on shelves for xmas and was not ready for release.I will make your pc crash.
1,Disaster!!,"It's odd, my laptop is fairly new. I wasn't able to play this game. Why? I'm not sure. My system passed their systems check. There was one thing that said acel? Not sure what that was. Save your money, if your computer isn't brand spanking new, your not playing this game. I had to learn that the hard way. I Hope you don't have to."
1,Don't waste your time,"My daughter got this game for Christmas, and we spent several hours on Christmas Eve trying to get it running with no luck. I read everything on the BV web site and downloaded new drivers for her computer's video chipset. None of it made any difference. We couldn't get it to run. This is a very poorly designed and programmed game. I will make sure to avoid any Buena Vista games in the future."
3,It refuses to play on my computers! Is that wierd?,The title pretty much sums it up. Both my laptop and desktop as well as my sister's laptop do not recognize the game as it is put in. I'm currently trying to figure out what the issue is. I cannot wait to play.
1,"Probably a fun game, but won't work on my brand new Sony Vaio laptop!","Two days ago I purchased a brand new Sony Vaio along with this game. It won't work. After trying to unsuccessfully locate a driver update on the Sony website, I visited the game website support only to find out that there is no driver update for my computer, nor is Intel making any plans to create one. My husband also got a brand new Sony Vaio laptop on the same day as me (only a different model) and it won't work on his. I also have an IBM 500X Thinkpad laptop (doesn't work) and a 2 year old eMachine desktop computer (doesn't work). I am so dissappointed with Buena Vista Games for creating a program that will not work on most computers."
2,Didn't Thrill Me,"This game was pretty lame, but I wasn't expecting it to be grand, either. It didn't carry the excitement or mystery that the actual show often produced. The characters didn't look anywhere near the real people. It was also a bit difficult to navigate and things would stick from time-to-time."
2,Don't buy this game isn't worth it.,"I played this game and it stopped working in the middle of the game! You can only play the beginning and that's it. It froze when it got good, I'm disappointed!"
3,Yawn!!!,"I wanted to like this movie I did. Katherine Hepburn is young and a great actress as always it took such a long time to get to the point of the movie. Everything is rather slow and thought out. The attempt at humor was too little too late for me. Overall, my opinion would be to watch this movie only if you are fans of both stars."
5,Romantic and clever movie!,"Katherine Hepburn is ravishing in this movie. She and Spencer Tracy have never been more sexy together. The scene with Hepburn in her big hat at the basball game while Tracy is explaining the game to her is very funny. The scene in Hepburn's New York apartment which is shot in all shadows where you only see Hepburn's and Tracy's silhouettes is very sexy and a clever way to shoot a romantic scene. The chemistry between Hepburn and Tracy in their first movie together gives the feeling of a new love just beginning(which it was!). Hepburn plays a very smart and sophisticated woman, but also convincingly plays a woman with no knowledge of sports or any ""know how"" in the kitchen - clearly a strong, capable woman who is still vulnerable. This is a wonderful film which has a good script, fine acting and great direction by George Stevens."
5,Censorship,I wrote a review of 'The Lost'. I praised the book but made reference to Mendelsohn's visits to Israel and his moral blinkers on the Palestinians and the review was taken down by Amazon.America land of the Free; doesn't look very free from here in Ireland.
2,"Poignant story, buried in dense pretentious book.","I had a most interesting experience reading this book. The basic story, the search for these six of Six Million, is compelling, haunting and introduced masterfully in the beginning of the book. However, as the book progressed, I began to feel that this was less about those six people than about the author's quest to impress us with detail, Biblical passages, and exhausting writing that I found almost narcissistic at times. I think there is a beautiful story in there somewhere. The restreminded me of how critical a good editor can be."
5,genealogy,"An interesting study of someone else's family.I thought it would be dry, but once I started reading it, impossible to put down.My son also loved to talk to his grandfather and learn about the family which is what intrigued me at first.Daniel Mendelsohn writes for the New Yorker and has a way with words.By the time I finished the book, I felt I knew all his relatives personally."
3,Very dense,I'm reading the book right now. It is very dense and hard to read; almost like going through the jungle. The story continues to build and it is *slowly* sucks you in so that you want to hear the story. I do feel an obligation to read this book as I did not have any family members perish in the holocaust -- this is my way of trying to appreciate what others experienced.
1,Should Have Been Written As a More Concise Guide to Jewish Genealogy,"Mendelsohn's Story is too much kitch, shtick and Brighton Beach Memoirs II, and scarcely little to add about the Holocaust. If not for his grandfather's argyles, matching sox and his seeming obsession for Connie Francis, family genealogy would have been a non-starter for Dan. Well as they say, ""there's no business like Shoah business."" So the beat goes on with another layer of irrelevancy about a still evolving subject.""Blessed are those with nothing to say and can not compelled to say it."""
3,"Lost, the search forSix of six million",Very wordy with lots of details about faamily history and the effects of the Holucoust.
2,Hire An Editor,"I bought this book as I started my business trip to China, hoping to enjoy a good book on the plane. I was really disappointed by the following:1. The pictures, though haunting and beautiful are not captioned. It would have been much better putting them in a section with captions. The least they could have done would have been to put them in the proper context.2. There is a great story somewhere in this book, but it got lost in the details and poor writing. It was very difficult to follow the story, even in circular Russian-doll style the author favors. It seemed to me that he just kept repeating the same thing in every chapter, adding just a bit to it.I think they should re-edit the book and publish again. This edition does not do justice to the story."
2,"overwrought, tangental, self-indulgent","A picture's worth a thousand words, yet author Mendelsohn (and his editors and publisher)chooses to go the long way around and describe a journey of photographs, interviews and international travels in words, words and more words, describing people and photograph after photograph with many digressions in to a Biblical narrative and tedious details about himself and his quest and his family. Really, you don't have to say everything. It's like he felt compelled to put EVERYTHING in this one book. I hope this guy doesn't teach writing."
1,A Cure for Insomnia,"I want so badly to know what happens to this family of 6, but I fall into a deep sleep every time I try to read this book. I started skipping all the Biblical theology excerpts in order to make my way through - still doesn't work - instant coma. I wanted to love this book so badly, yet I think this is another instance where there is a blatant lack of editing. The publicists should receive a bonus for selling this book."
3,At a snail's pace,"If you like genealogy and if you like really really slow books or soap operas wherein the plot moves excrutiatingly slowly, and if you are trapped on a runway on a plane for 12 hours and have nothing else to do, you could like this book; I'm a fast reader and this book seemed like 20000 pages long. The story is very interesting but goes sooooooooo slowly, and the detail in the book is exhausting and mind-numbing. I had to skip several pages often because I just couldn't deal with the detail and slowness: paragraphs and pages of slow conversations often seemed to contribute minimally to the story or had subtleties that flew over my head, and what people wore and looked like, detail about detail, long philosophies about tangentially related Bible stories. It literally made me tired to read it. But I liked the true and inspirational story. It would make a terrific Reader's Digest Condensed Book."
3,The Lost,"This is a good book but the effort to write this book and the passion, is greater. This is an indepth personal journey and you are in the experience, at times this is tedious but it is as well an enriching experience and engaging. There are appealing charachter stories but also descriptions of human torture and brutality so I say I think some sensitivity should be demonstrated in marketing books about the Holocaust, the material is true but it is brutal and should not be associated with words like ""hilarious"" on the back cover. I am referring to the review quote by Jonathan Safran Foer who describes the book as being ""at times hilarious"". I did not come across anything in the book that I would define as hilarious."
3,Sorry I ordered it,"I ordered this on Kindle. By the time I got to reading it, it was too late to return it. The premise was so interesting. Not that The Lost is a bad book, it just over talks itself so much that I was hardly past the first few pages that I began skipping. While the review mentions a man trying to find out the truth about family lost in the WWII Holocaust , there is section after section, page after page of interpretations of the Torah, including histories of the Torah's greatest scholars. It is very repetitive. Rather like an old uncle who tells you the same story of the same people over and over and over. The reader is continuously told about the American cemetery (membership required) for Jews from a certain small area of Poland and continuously reminded of the town's name. I am happy for the author that he has so many good reviews but I would rather have had a straight forward story (as the beginning of the book leads one to believe it would be). I think I just plain got bored."
1,Beats you over the head with a sledgehammer,"I'll admit - I couldn't even finish the book ... actually, I couldn't get past 100 pages. The book is overly sentimental bordering on maudlin, repetitive (how many times do we have to be reminded that the author looks like his grandfather's brother?), and filled with too many incomprehensible sentences within sentences. The book's tone seemed manufactured, ie, it seemed like the author felt his emotions in order to write about them in this book. Disappointing, given the strong reviews on Amazon."
2,Where are the comma police????,"After looking forward to reading this fascinating story, I was shocked, no, horrified, to see how many run-on sentences this book contained. It was hard to follow the thought of the writer in many cases. And the overuse of the poor comma was so distracting that I found myself re-reading far too many sentences.I was quite disappointed in seeing an incredible story that should be told ruined by the apparent poor editing on someone's part."
1,The Worst,"This book is one of the worst I have read. The author seems to be trying to do a multitude of things - tell the story, impress readers with his Jewishness, and use all of the words he possibly can. One sentence took up 3/4 of a page! The narrative is difficult to follow as he digresses frequently and it seems that he jumps back and forth between locals, people and stories. The writing is so convoluted one can not keep track of the individuals and events he is talking about as he progresses through his search. I tried to read it all but finally just gave up. He is trying to be James Joyce without the talent to do so."
2,not that interesting...,i read the rave reviews and i bought this book. i did not find it as compelling or as interesting as the reviews led me to believe it would be. disappointed.
2,Worked for about a week.,This helped the hot flashes for about a week. Then I was searching for something else. The only thing that really works is prescription hormones.
3,Difficult to assess,"This was recommended for my wife by a naturopath, and there were some positive changes after starting it, but there were also other changes made at the same time. So whether the wild yam had anything or much to do with it is unknown. We will say, however, that Nature's Way has always appeared to be a top quality brand, and we have high confidence in the brand, at least.Back to this specific product, ""your mileage may vary."" But it may not be because of the product - every body is different."
3,"So, so","I felt that this product was actually working right at first. I felt the twinges and slight pain associated with sudden breast increase. I don't know if its my occasional soda and/or coffee intake that has caused the cesssation of feelings, but I do not feel that the product is working any more. I have ordered Pueraria Mirifica (not sure of the spelling)and then will probably give up after this."
4,Hot flash Relief,I use 2 a day for hot flashes. It works great on me with no side effects. I stopped taking them for awhile and noticed the hot flashes came back again. Now this is a part of my daily routine.
1,Please don't buy it,I had a hard time to relief the anxiety and panic attack which are caused by itRead and read about it before you buy it
1,`defective,"a defective machine that failed to fun ction al all-the company gave me directions to pursue that we're impossible to follow -the only bright part ofthis deal is that Amazon took back the machine without conflict ot hesitation - full postage paid and full refund.Additionaally the machine itself was ""tinny"",insubstattial and cheap appearing.I bought a Canon for about thr dsme price at Best Buy-worked beautifully fron the get go-and appears a well designed and substantial machine - has some substance to it,Thanks Amazon for trying but I would advise you to drop the line, D Macdonald"
4,Great fax and inkjet printer,"I PURCHASED THIS FAX FOR $99.99 WITH A $40.00 REBATE.THIS UNIT CAN FAX AND PRINT IN COLOR AND BLACK. THE PRINT IS VERY CLEAR.I CONNECTED THIS UNIT TO MY PC WITH A USB 2.0 CABLE,IT CAN'T BE OVER 6' LONG .THIS IS A PLUS BECAUSE YOU CAN PRINT FROM YOUR PC.IT HAS A 300 PAGE MEMORY AND 10 ONE BUTTON INSTANCE PHONE NUMBERS CONNECTOR.THERE ARE 4 INKJET CARTRIDGES WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE YOU CAN REPLACE THE COLOR THAT IS NEEDED.THE SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD IS VERY SLOW FROM THE WEB SITE ONLY.I HAD TO TRY 4 TIMES BEFORE I GOT THE PRINTER AND FAX SOFTWARE.I RECOMMEND THIS FAX OVER A TONER FAX ANY DAY. IT HAS A QUICK SETUP AND A LARGE OWNER MANUEL TO EXPLAIN ALL THE FEATURES.THIS MACHINE REALLY LOOKS NICE AND EXPENSIVE.IT IS A GREAT BUY AND THE $40.00 REBATE IS A PLUS."
1,Looking to get rid of this fax machine,"I just again gave it a yellow cartridge although I've only printed black, because it wants one, and it wants another one. The one I removed I only put in last week, and it sure looks full of ink to me. This is ridiculous and I have spent a lot of money - more than the fax machine is worth - on COLOR ink when I am only receiving black and white faxes. It just won't print when it THINKS it needs more color ink! I am ready to throw it out - right now I can't get it to print without going out and buying more yellow cartridges to ""try"" them out, because it refuses to recognize this one as having ink.And by the way, I couldn't find any help on the Brother site. It seems that this machine is no longer in their pull-down list. I did, however, find many unhappy reviews on the web with others having the same problems."
4,very happy,Very happy with this set. Well balanced and strong enough that it will not bend out of shape. The young kids can grasp it easily too.
3,Its Aiight!!!!,"Its Aiight, It aint nothing to write home to mom about, the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of Nadine, she was worth watching the whole flick, but its worth a peep, if you got 20.00 dollars to burn. I would admit, the women were nice to look at."
4,chaotic as hell,"this is a must-have for any rebels or anarchists out there. ""digital hardcore"" is the most insane noise i have ever heard. Atari Teenage Riot combine hip hop, electronica, hardcore techno, and everything into a MINDBLOWING album. the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is a couple of slow songs that can get sort of boring but other than that BUY THIS ALBUM. its money well spent."
1,oh my god why did i buy this,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm what a good cd oh yes it comes in handy for a drink coaster or a beach frizbee. i highly recommend this cd if u enjoy drinking or the beach
5,Awesome Drink Blender!,We make a lot of smoothies and icees and this blender blends ice better than any blender I have seen. It is even better than the smoothies in our mall. The ice has an almost silky texture that is fantastic. I think it is the specialized way the container and blade is shape cause all of the ice is pulled down. We are saving a lot of money making our own drinks with just ice and fruit than paying $5 and $8 a drink elsewhere. This is especially good since my wife and I are grad students and we don't have the extra money anyways but we do like iced drinks during our studies. We don't make sauces or anything else with this blender and it isn't a household multi purpose blender but it is great at making drinks.
1,Vivian,"Do not buy this product from MV Trading Co as it is shipped directly from China and is the cheap 110V and not exportable quality, though they say they sell internationally 'They happily send you a product you can't use'This item is a non exportable product, sold at the exportable price, not bad ... and they don't care ... they laugh at you and are very rude ... and say gleefully, it's your problem as they now have your money. If you need a blender try Restaurant Source, not only are they cheaper, they are informed on their product and sell both 110V and 240V appliances ""Internationally"" and don't try to rip you off"

2,Not as good as After the Abduction,"Usually I read romance novels in a matter of hours--but this one took me several days as I never really got into it enough to care about the characters. This upset me a little--after all, After the Abduction was a great story that I couldn't get enough of. The heroine in this one is a little too perfect, the hero a little too light, and everything felt just slightly contrived. And, I have to be honest...I was waiting for the big twin moment (the hero is a twin) when Clara knows Morgan without question...something that I love about ""twin"" romances...but it didn't come, and that was a let down for me.My advice? Read After the Abduction and give this one a miss."
2,Not a fan of this one...,"This book had so much potential but I am having a difficult time getting finishing it.**Some may consider this a spoiler**I figured I would just sit down and get through it since I was about 80% done; however, Morgan's childishness about Clara's love for the children she cares for just made me really dislike him. He says something to the effect that ""You love them more than you love me..... prove that you love me more."" Yuck! Then they proceed to make love. No, Thank You.I can't even finish this book now because I'd rather she not end up with him."
3,UM... OK,"Though it may be because I read the book out of order, but this book to me didn't read like the Sabrina Jefferies I love, there was no wit, no humor. One can always count on a good bit of humor in her books, which is well within the context of the story and the characters. Sadly it was missing here. I will say though that both the hero and heroine were well suited to each other, though her need to know everything got old and rather childish. The conflict of this troubled hero made this book for me, she was able to save the story because of it. For this reader the pace just seemed to lag until the last 60 pages or so when the story was rushed to a sastisfying end. Another drawback to my enjoyment might have been all the secondary characters, which probably weren't needed. Not one of her best stories, but worth a read if you are a fan of hers or the period."
5,A very good read,"I've only recently started to follow Sabrina Jeffries' novels, coming in late on the Swanlea series but truly enjoying each of them. DANCE OF SEDUCTION is no exception. It's a fun read, with twists and turns that keep things moving quickly. Morgan and Clara's romance was charming and sensual, with many witty moments that made me smile. :->"
4,Another good one by Ms. Jeffries,"Can a lady find her soul mate in the slums of London? Yes, she can! This story is about a gentleman (who happens to be a twin) that works for the crown as a spy. His cover is that he conducts unsavory business. The heroine does not want said person (unsavory, that is) next to her school where she tries to reform young men before it is too late.The author does a good job of character development. The hero and heroine have good chemistry and though you know the ending (it's a romance novel after all), interest is held until the end.Note regarding my review: This book is the fourth in the sequence and I read it first. The hero, Morgan Pryce was introduced in book two, but we learned more details about him in book three. Despite reading the books out of order, I did not feel as if I was missing anything regarding the character."
3,Mejor de lo que pensaba,"La verdad es que le hice el quite a este libro durante tiempo, pensando que era una especie de producto de los talleres que hace G.M. pero hace poco lo leí de una sentada y me sorprendió. No está a la altura de ninguno de sus libros de ficción y tampoco es gran periodismo, pero todo el trozo que cubre la reclusión de las mujeres y la forma que buscan para sobrevivir al encierro es notable. Lo que más molesta del libro es que no toma ningún riesgo. Es plano, ultracorregido y sobreeditado. Y además, esa tendencia a describir a todos los parientes de las secuestradas poco menos que como personajes de teleserie es desagradable: son unidimensionales, incorruptibles, incansables. No hay drama ni interés ahí, sino que en el encierro. Lástima que el libro no comenzara y terminara dentro de esas cuatro paredes. Para leer una pura vez."
4,Great machine for the money,"I considered comparable multifunction machines from HP & Brother. Both were more expensive and did not offer flat top scanning/copying which was important to me. Therefore, I went with Samsung. After one month of use, I am completely satisfied with Samsung. It is compact, looks very nice, does everything more than adequately. Print quality seems good. First copy takes 10-15 seconds warm up time but then it is blazing fast. It is a bit noisy when printing. Also, the original ink cartridge lasted surprisingly short time. My guess is that it was just a ""start-up"" cartridge, not ""full size"" one.All in all, a very good buy for the money."
4,inexpensive /good performer,"I bought this to replace a brother mfp that broke within 1yr. The brand ""Samsung"" and price were a factor. After upacking it-setup and software installation was flawless. I could tell when unpacking it- it was not flimsy plastic like the Brother MFP (which had plastic parts break off). It is very solid. And so far it is performing all functions -as it should.Considering the price, I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it. Only minor drawback is when in use as a printer a little slow to warm up and start."
5,Glad I purchased it,"And you will be, too! Just compare this baby to comparable models: price, features, and design, it can't be beat. I do lots of faxing, copying, printing, and scanning, and this unit fits my needs like a glove.I have only two small pet peeves with the samsung: 1) the unit is a bit loud, until it goes to ""sleep mode"" 2) Instruction manual isn't printed, just in pdf form.But if you could live with these very minor issues, you'll love this multi funcion unit!"
2,Jams frequently!,"I've had this printer about a year. When it prints, it prints very fast, and produces high-quality output. The copier works nicely.My complaint is that it jams very frequently. Maybe not half the time, like another reviewer reported, but at least a quarter of the time.Actually, what happens most of the time it ""jams"" is that the printer stops printing and says there is a jam, but when I open it up there is nothing jammed. I re-seat the toner cartridge and it starts printing again. Very, very annoying.It is loud, but if the thing would actually print without jamming, I would be fine with it. I want to like it, but I don't much."
2,The All-In-One-Paper-Jam,"Severely disappointed with Samsung. I pretty much can expect to have a paper jam every time I print on this piece of junk. Kudos, Samsung-Engineers!"
2,I can not get it to work,I bought this translator a week ago. It work for one week. One day I tried to turn it on and I couldn't. I changed batteries and I also but a scotch tape on the batteries to prevent them from touching the metal cover. Again I saw no results. The only thing I hear a long beep but I cannot see anything. Contrast does not help either. It is a pity because this translator is very good. I do not want to return it but it seems that I have no choice. I hope someone can give me a tip how to solve this problem soon.
4,Response to those with Battery Problems,"I had the battery problems that two reviewers wrote about. I changed batteries twice and they went dead within two days. I wrote to the company and was luckier than some of you in that a tech told me that I have to put plastic (scotch) tape over the batteries so they don't come into contact with the metal cover. I don't want to negate your bad experiences, but since you have the device I hope this helps. Note that I have downgraded my rating one point due to the documentation that doesn't include this simple direction."
1,Don't Buy This Product,The first one didn't work from the start and I returned it to Amazon.Com. The second one drained the batteries in a matter of days. I returned that one...The replacement had the same problems. The fourth one worked a little better. I kept replacing the batteries every month or two. I just replaced all three batteries and it doesn't work at all. It is not worth all the hassle. The product has some serious design flaws. It should be taken off the market until the problems are corrected.
5,Solid value and dependability,"I found this device really good at what it is meant to do - namely replace a regular paper dictionary. The vocabulary base was suitably inclusive and the search functions make it really quick and easy to find the words I am looking for. I haven't had any problem with the batteries myself and when I called customer service about how to use some of the bonus software, I was treated well.One thing I really appreciate is the new words recording function that lets me add to it in the rare case I don't find the word I need.Overall, a good product."
2,"A quick read and summary, but ultimately confusing","A short book can be a great introduction to a topic, or provide a quick overview to something that you do not care to delve further in. Or, it can leave out so much context and nuance, that it is simply confusing. I am a history buff, but not a Japan expert attracted by the topic and timeframe of this book. And I cannot say I did not learn anything or that the book was dry and uninteresting. But it was breathtakingly quick...seeming to jump through the decades, introducing and then throwing away topics and characters and leaving one with far more questions than answers. I cannot comment on the biases others have noted, because I do not have enough knowledge to judge, but there was a certain ""flip-ness"" to the writing that was irritating, and the overall structure and pace was so flawed I cannot recommend this book regardless of its accuracy or insight."
2,A great start but final third a waste of time,"For me a very informative beginning but got less interesting the more I read, probably due to a combination of a lack of detail (even for a summary) and the fact that I've already read Embracing Defeat.The further into the text you go, the more Mr. Buruma seems like part of the ""Japan is Evil"" camp, even going so far as to make opinionated assertions not supported by fact.Speaking of facts, it seems some checking is in order. Iwo Jima as a base for B-29s? Everthing I've read says that was Saipan and Iwo Jima was for emergency landings and fighters that escorted the B-29s.Finally, I would like to mention that to me it seems inappropriate to specifically review other reviewers. Vote on the usefulness of their reveies sure, but if you have more to say start you own blog or something."
5,"quick, easy and slappy","This nice little read is a helpful introduction to modern japanese history and thought. We learn about the early europeans meeting the xenophobic japanese. We learn of early japanese democracy and early japanese military adventures. We learn about the many tensions in japanese society that led the march to war. We learn oft he emperorors complicity and japanese love of suicide and assasination. We learn about the post war economy and the time of Macarthur. A great and quick read, very accesible."
4,Understanding Japan,As a US Marine in WW2 I naturally tried to understand Japan. I got numerous bits of sometimes conflicting information from numerous books on the subject.Ian Buruma gives it a continuity that connects it all in a small volume.I had a bit of trouble remembering the names of Japanese politicians but I recommend it highly for anyone who attempts to understand Japan.
3,Overrated,"Surprisingly, I find myself basically agreeing with the Japanese reviewer named Hitoshi Noguchi. There's no need to buy this book; you can read it in a bookstore in one afternoon. Buruma writes well, but most of what he has written here has been written before by himself and others. There are a few factual errors (for example, Eisaku Sato was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974, not 1972) that give me the impression Buruma didn't put too much effort into completing this thin volume. A far cry from being a profound book about modern Japan."
3,OK for the cost,"I wanted a classic keyboard and not all the bells and whistles that are difficult to avoid. Functionally, this is great. A little noisy and a backspace key just labeled with a back arrow, but works great for the price."
1,this turbine is not built well,received this turbine and installed on roof. flimsy construction. once installed it started squeaking. a good wind would bend it. the sellers were fantastic to work with. gave me credit back for its return. but the product itself? bad--flimsy--noisy--cheaply made. stay away from this one.
1,very disappointed,"By the advertisment, I was led to believe this was the movie and not the behind the scenes....stupid, stupid, stupid!!"
2,not worth buying,"It seemed promising at first, especially considering Betsy Palmer was involved. Great scenery, mediocre acting... I think the movie was overpowered by all the bluegrass/country/backwoods music. Maybe it's 'cause I'm not a fan of that kind of music- actually, no, I can appreciate the music. What I have issue with is 1: it makes up about half the movie... like they were using the movie as a vehicle to sell their music. 2: It didn't create a suspenseful or scary mood... might as well have called it the Hee-Haw Witch. Overall, what could have been a great film, fell flat for me. and now I'm sad. :( :)"
4,A Great Movie that No One has Seen,"I love this movie. The very proper Robert Duval and the salty Richard Harris play off of each other very well, and you'll fall in love with the very young Sandra Bullock. This is not an action flick - I find it relaxing to watch when I'm stressed, especially the haircut scene. I recommend this anyone who wants to see a movie about interesting characters and not explosions."
5,Fast Delivery - Many Thanks!,"My mom loved the video and appreciated the speed with which she received it, as did I. Thank you!"
5,Why isn't this film available on DVD????,"Simply put, it's one of the finest movies I've ever seen. Every human being on the planet would benefit from sitting down and watching this film--it's important and enriching on so many levels."
4,"The writing can be tough, but the book is rich and learned.","The decades of Motz's academic work in myth and folklore are on powerful display. In the first three chapters she critically undermines the whole notion of the ancient European ""Goddess Religion"" and points out how this modern construct is a response to current social concerns. The bulk of the work is given over to an examination of the role of female deities in various pre-modern cultures (Mexico, Siberia, Near East). The result is a richer and more complex understanding of the role of both goddesses and women in these societies. The academic writing style is better than that of many social scientists, and the included illustrations are appreciated. Strongly recommended for those interested in myth, folklore, or the social impact of theology."
4,One Great Goddess ?,"This book presents a careful dissection of the supposed evidence of a One Great Goddess cult. The author clearly shows the fallicy in using fragments (often times literally) to support a prehistoric and early historic religious belief in a peaceful mother goddess who was overthrown by masculine, war-like deities.Not a perfect book, but it does the job."
2,Not very good,"I originally had one of these and it makes typing really hard and after awhile (a week or two), it got really disgusting with crap all over it like dust and such. Instead I just threw it away and got the Marware protection pack which I love. I wouldn't recommend this product."
3,Very superficial,"This book while somewhat informative is composed primarely of black and white photograghs which is typical of many of the Schiffer publications. If a person is really interesed in the ""Pfeil"" the ""Dornie 335 Arrow"" by J. Richard Smith et. al.is thorough, exhaustive, and informative. ( Also more expensive)"
2,It's better than no book at all,"Heinz Nowarra's book ""DORNIER DO 335 ""Pfeil"""" is about the same length, width and weight as a Squadron/Signal publication but that is as far as the resemblence goes. It consists of little more than a number of black & white photos of the DO 335 with a few line drawings and on cutaway diagram that must have been greatly reduced from a larger image because it is hard to decipher. There is a small amount of commentary but no camouflage & insiginia guides found in the Squadron/Signal books.If you don't want to spend the $50+ for one of the Monogram books and are desperate for something about the Pfeil then this book is usuable."
5,Mirage Omnicam 6,"Sound great, I am using these for the back two channels in a 7.1 system, the other speakers are Mirage OMD's also."
1,Terrible Backup Software,"I bought the Maxtor OneTouch III based on its great reviews. It is a fine portable disk, but the backup software is completely unacceptable. In very fine print the manual tells you that it does not back up hidden or busy files. Hidden files include Microsoft Outlook mailboxes, among other important files. If you have your mail or another file open when the backup runs, it is not backed up. You can replace the bad Maxtor backup software with another backup program, but then you are just using the Maxtor as an expensive external drive."
5,Superb field guide,"This excellent field guide identifies western NA herps down to species level, and rather than photos (which may be misleading), it has excellent generalized pictures, with lines pointing to locations of key diagnostic features. The species accounts in the back are quite useful, and the range maps comprehensive and detailed. Absolutely a critical resource for anyone who likes to catalog animals, or has interest in identifying species."
3,Good,"Got it on time, and it was the right book... Even though I didn't use it for the class it was purchased for, it was inexpensive that it didn matter"
5,A great CD by a Wonderful Songbird.,"I have owned this CD in cassette form for over 12 years and the songs still are special to me. Having attended 2 concerts by Elkie back in 1988 and 89, I have seen first hand the energy she puts into her singing. The songs are hard hitting and her voice really drives home the words. From the title song, ""No More the Fool"", to ""Hold the dream"", the songs are so well done. Elkie's rendition of Bob Seger's song ""We've Got Tonight"", is unbelievable good. I recommend this CD to any one who enjoys singers like Elkie Brooks, Bonnie Tyler, Meatloaf, and others with a hard edge to their ballads."
3,real life story worse than fiction horror story?,"Equal employment led to some troubles in a iron ore strip minein Minnesota. At the best mining is an hazardous profession,but strip mining is environmentally the worst.So when it turned out that the profiteering ownersweren't willing to protect their female workers from the male ones,the ""nuts and sluts defense"" was used against an home town girl.Since she wasn't a nut or a slut and the abuse was very realby the male workers, the company lost in court.But they are still strip mining there...."
5,Excellent Movie,This movie is wonderful. I have only good things to say about it. You should see it!
4,Thought Provoking and Well Portrayed,"I'm not certain a person can ""enjoy"" this movie unless they are completely insensitive. Some scenes are disturbing, so definately would not recommend for young viewers, but overall the picture was emotionally thought provoking. The acting is superb. Charlize Theron gave an outstanding performance, as did most of the cast, and I was particularly impressed with Sean Bean's ability to maneuver his heavy Yorkshire into MinnesOta slang so convincingly. As for a few things that could have been improved upon, there are times when the storyline lags; simply using the ""F"" word half as many times could have saved 15-minutes."
4,"You already know the specifics, so...","...I'll just tell you that this film has several incredibly dramatic passages that just pull you in and put you through some heavy emotional gymnastics. AND...there's a magnificent performance from Charlize Theron, who is surely one of the finest actors of our time. I know these movies are embellished for general consumption, but after I watched NORTH COUNTRY, I couldn't help but think about what women go through as they attempt to infiltrate predominantly male workspaces. Especially those as macho as mines or the like. NORTH COUNTRY is worth your time."
2,Tedious and Endless,"This film presents an interesting but sad story about female miners who were living in an impossible situation in Northern Minnesota mine country. However, the presentation of the fact that these women were constantly hassled on their jobs and in their community is way overdone. And nearly every single male character in the movie is portrayed as vulgar and evil, with the exception of one miner's husband and the lawyer who takes the harrassment case to court.This movie tedious and neverending, and much of the dialoge is so ""movie of the week."" Skip it."
1,Pathetic,"The beautiful Charlize Theron plays the stupidest, most cowardly woman ever born. She and her equally dim and helpless union sisters/friends endure an endless litany of hideous indignities, going well, WELL past the point where any healthy woman of my acquaintence would've repeatedly kneed the nearest male, and then sued him out of house and home."
5,North Country Scores!,"North Country is one of my new favorite films, the acting is perfect and the storyline is amazing. I am a fan of movies that are based on true stories, and this one is on top of most all of them. Charlize Theoron is a wonderful actress with a great amount of talent. I think North Country should have been nominated for a lot more Academy Awards, because it was definetly a top-notch film."
4,YOU GO GIRL,"CHarlize Theron gives another Oscar caliber performance and give a left to a movie that was good, but could have been better. It was a bit slow moving at parts for me. It is based on a true story that actually had happenned in the state of Minnsota. It is based on the book Class Action THe story of Lois Jenson and the Landmark case that changed the Sexual Harrassment Laws. I think it gives great comentary to women's right where a job usually domanated by males can get justice and still come up on top."
2,"Simplistic, heavy-handed feminist tract","""North Country"" tells the story of a woman (played by Charlize Theron) who successfully fought sexual harassment at a Northern Minnesota steel mill.It's a very worthy subject but sadly this film is so heavy handed it all adds up to nought. The filmmakers were obviously passionate about the subject but the film is so obvious with cardboard villains and ridiculous courtroom scenes to make any soap opera writer blush.Director Niki Caro (whose previous film ""Whale Rider"" brought her to international attention) seems out of her depth here and it just turns into a simplistic feminist tract. Hugely disappointing given the source material and talent involved."
1,OOOOPS,"The video was defective as other North Country videos I have purchased. Tried it on 3 different systems to no avail. ??? is there a problem with all of the North Country discs????.Enjoyed the content,,. An excellent story!"
5,"Healthy Origins Cholestene/ Red Yeast Rice, lowered my cholesterol!","My total cholesterol had been about 225 for years- I eat fast foods/pizza..., and don't exercise enough.My Dr. kept ""Badgering"" me to go on script statins- NO WAY, after Googling their Awful side-effects!After 1yr of 2 caps of HO RYR at breakfast & 2 more with dinner- My Cholesterol dropped to 172 (LDL lower, but no change to HDL or Triglycerides).BTW!- It's Very important to take CoQ10 with ANY statin!- I take 50mg of 1/2 price Healthy Origins Ubiquinol CoQ10 (Ubiquinol is 2x best form!) with each meal.Healthy Origins, UBIQUINOL 50MG - 150 SGELI also take 1x of top-rated Swanson EFA's Omega-3 fish oil, twice daily!FYI- CL rated Natures Plus Extended Release 1.7% RYR #1, and Healthy Origins #2- for lovastatin/purity.Many user reviews on the NP Extended Release complained of sleep issues (common for me), so I went with HO."
2,No IOS installed,"I bought two of this switches and they came with no OS installed, I really don't like this, I've trying to put the IOS via Xmodem and is not working :S"
3,Great Gift,My mom loves lighthouses so she picked this puzzle out and she is in her fifties and did it in about a week give or take. She liked it but wished it was more complicated and she also said it was missing two pieces. Other than that nothing is wrong with it except its overly simple to accomplish and the picture quality isn't like a Thomas Kincade or anything. I guess if you need something to do than this is it.
5,V/A &#65533; Mundial Muzique&#65533;,"Not content with being a spiritual black dance label, Chicago's Guidance Recordings have taken it upon themselves to show all second rate compilers a thing or two about what makes a compilation great. Selecting modern Afro-Carribbean, Latin and Brazilian rhythms from all points between Helsinki, Berlin, New York and Rio. Artists featured here are in the top league with contemporary producers Bill Summers, MAW, Da Lata, Azymuth, and Nick Holder all throwing in their weight. Not a filler in sight, the treasure trove includes Nu Spirit Helsinki's ""Afro-Cuban Sunshine"" The Har Yu Percussion Group vs Jazzanova with ""Welcome to the Party"" and the astonishing ""Ife Bobowa"" from the painfully talented Brother of Soul. Latin and Afro soaked music may not be of instant appeal to many, but this compilation is strongly recommended and guaranteed to provide smiles and hip sways.Guidance we salute you."
3,Last edition was better,"During my undergraduate German studies, I used the 4th edition in several courses, and I found it to be indispensable and still use it for reference. Now that I'm a college-level instructor, I've used this 5th edition for a couple of courses, as well, and I find the explanations quite convoluted and complicated sometimes. Several of my colleagues, both current and former, have the same complaints about this book and many think that the revisions made were just for the sake of printing a new edition. Whatever the case may be, the book still is a good resource, but things could be simplified a bit."
4,Great Book/ WRONG Pub. date,"This is a fabulous-easy to understand review of German Grammar. The appendix summary of the writing reforms is especially useful. I ordered a used copy of this book; however,it is copywrited 2001- NOT 2006! I was hoping for a more up-to-date book. My cover matches the cover posted here exactly and is the third edition. Definitely an error occurred somewhere in this listing. Don't pay $100 for a book published in 2001! Otherwise, I am very happy with this book."
1,This book is highly ineffective in helping students.,"Hi, This book is very poor in helping students trying to solve its problems. The problems are such a great extension of what is covered in each chapter, I'm not even sure if most professors could completely solve its problems. I am looking for a legal solution manual to this book. I will pay top dollar for it."
3,"Maybe a Decent Reference, but Bad to Learn From","I would give it 2.5 stars if I could - I don't think it quite deserves 3.A wealth of information. If you're looking for it, it's probably at least mentioned in here if it's mentioned in any QM textbook anywhere. Might make a good reference, then.However, as a book to learn from it seems generally obtuse difficult to read (though some sections are better or worse than others). It isn't just that it's abstract or mathematical - I don't mind that at all; in fact that's one of the strengths of this book in my opinion - but that the necessary explanation just isn't there, or is ineffective."
2,This book is unreadable,"I was lucky to have other books and a great instructor in Quantum Mechanics, otherwise I wouldn't have learned the subject at all. The language of this book is very dry and abstract at the same time, leaving the reader without an idea of what it all has to do with the real life. The approach to teaching is by no means classical and lacks examples. Another thing that I didn't like (and that unfortunately occurs so often in scientific literature) is the way references were handled: the author would send you 10 chapters back to substitute formulas 178 and 186 into another one 5 chapters back to get a result on the current page, whereas in good books relevant formulas would just be re-typed once again for reader's convenience.Having said all that, I also need to say that the author did a good job picking the problems for this text. They are of moderate difficulty and well related to the discussion in a preceding chapter."
2,A failed attempt,"This book was originally written to make Schiffs book on quantum mechanics available to a wider audience. It was supposed to be simpler and more readable. Never happened. It is too wordy by far and many topics are actually covered very superficially with the student then being expected to solve difficult problems as though the treatment had been complete. Unfortunately, this is a common malady of physics texts. If you want a wordy, good, reasonably complete, text then Messiah's book is excellent."
3,Works pretty well - wouldn't have chosen tool-less if I had it to do over again,"I bought these to put a bunch of Cat6 outlets around my house. They work just fine, but the tool-less thing is kind of a gimmick. It's actually a lot easier to use the kind that require punching down. Once I got the hang of it, it wasn't that much more work, but it was definitely more.The results look great and work very well - no duds and no re-dos required. I ran all of the plugs back to a patch panel (110 punchdown type, very easy to work with) and haven't seen any connectivity issues whatsoever.If you want the best price and the easiest setup, I would highly recommended checking out [...] as they have much lower prices on this type of equipment (I didn't use them for this project because I had a substantial amount of Amazon gift cards saved up)."
3,GOOD STARTER KIT,"NOT TOP OF THE LINE, BUT A SOME NECESSARY THINGS TO GET STARTED. THE SANSA CASE SHOULD HAVE A SCREEN PROTECTOR ON IT AND THE BELT CLIP IS A BIT FLIMSY, BUT OVERALL, NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE"
4,Initiation,"I'm glad I finnaly found this piece of Todd's work on CD. It brought back memories of days well gone by.I've searched high and low for his ""Works"" and finally found it without bidding against other fans on ebay."
2,Any album with REAL MAN can`t be all that bad?..,YES IT CAN! Unfortunatly. I`m a huge Todd fan and REAL MAN is one of his greatest songs and I truly thought this would be a classic mix of Todd`s synth experiments with some classic SONGS! There are no songs to speak of here other than the gorgeous PRANA (and that`s an instrumental!) THE DEATH OF ROCK&ROLL has a few cool riffs and that`s about it. Todd should have just stuck with the single release REAL MAN b/w PRANA and maybe save the other experiments on the cutting room floor. Put it this way INTUITION is a poor man`s TODD!
2,2 stars,"With ""Todd,"" Rundgren ran himself through a sieve that nevertheless managed to filter out some great tunes. With ""Initiation"" he ran himself into a brick wall. It's a terribly overproduced album, so much so that the good song ""Real Man"" gets washed over with oceans of synths and cymbals. The extended pieces just aren't interesting and drift along without a solid focus. Todd made a much better album out of this template with ""Healing"" in 1981. And you can get ""Real Man"" on the Anthology (or, in a better version, on the live ""Back to the Bars"")."
2,Todd throws a curve ball,"""Real Man"" is a terrific opening song and you would think the rest of the album will be of comparable quality and then he gets all crazy and self indulgent.. This is when Todd, I think, was crazy and thought he could do whatever he wanted. Hey Todd! Art should always have an audience and this was brutal.""Eastern Intrigue"" is OK but the rest was really, really bad. It was unlistenable in the psychodelic 70's. Today, it is even worse.I saw Todd on the LIARS tour and he played ""Born to Synthesize"" ...yuck...I am not the artist but as a fan, I am the audience I know what should and should not be played. I am the customer. An artist should play their good songs not their bad songsGet the song ""real man"" off of a compilation and stay away from this garbage!"
1,An insult to his listeners,"Todd Rundgren is part genious, part kid, and part lazy bumb. This work, when contrasted with Lies is pathetic. Using one long song on one side to fill up the album with junk is a slap in the face of his fans.I love ""The Last Ride"" but the rest of this album can just be trashed."
1,What Was Todd On When He Came Up With This?,"If there ever was a reason to stay drug-free, Initiation proves it. Todd, easily one of the most gifted songwriters in pop rock history, completely falls off the deep end with Initiation. I'm not going to experiment with what Todd used to come up with this album, but perhaps that means that I won't ever appreciate this album. I'm fine with that--the bizarre album is virtually unlistenable except for the first track. Todd has dozens of classic songs, so even devoted Todd-ees can skip purchasing Initiation and have a real complete disography of his work."
5,Another winner from Todd.....,"This album is mesmerizing. Not a weak track on it, and believe me, although Todd goes over the top at times on ""A Treatise on Cosmic Fire,"" the track still gets better and better with repeated listenings. ""Eastern Intrigue,"" ""Fair Warning,"" and ""Real Man"" are standouts for me, although I love EVERY track. Highly recommended."
1,Worse than Vermont American,Someone told me that these are great blades. Mine wobbled all over the place. I just use it for chopping wood these days.
2,Not Enough,It all depends on what kind of review book you are looking for to study for the CCRN. This book is generalized and broad. I prefer study guides that do not make you go to other references to relearn what you need to know. I like it all in one place.
2,Waste of money!,"Don't waste your money, my son would rather suck on his fingers than to use this messaging corn teether. The massager really has to be squeezed in order to work. :("
5,Best Teether,"Surprisingly it's hard to find a teether that my son will actually use. This is hands down the best teether he owns because he actually uses it. It is the only teether that he will keep putting in his mouth and doesn't get frustrated at. The teether gently vibrates once he chomps down on the rubber star. The other end of the teether has a spinning part that he loves to play with as well. Even though you can't wash it, you can easily wipe it down with a wet cloth/wipes. We've had it for a month and with daily use, it's still vibrating no problem."
4,good idea,"I like this product a lot, but was very excited to receive it to apply on my 5 month old who is starting the whole teething process... the product vibrates great, the colors are attractive to her, and as soon as she sees it its the first thing she wants to grab. However, its a little heavy for her and in order to make it vibrate I have to hold it because it requires more strength than her tiny mouth has at the moment. Hopefully as she becomes stronger she can use this product better. But overall I really like it."
3,Take it or leave it,"I believe this product is well made, and for some babies it's probably a favorite. Our granddaughter, however, isn't crazy about it. She will use it sporadically, always smiling when the tether vibrates, but then she doesn't want it any longer. No soother for teething here, just a rarely used toy in her book. If they put nubby soft bristles on this, instead of it being a smooth finish, I think it would be a hit."
5,Nice buy,My daughter likes this one. She especially loves the rattle at the end and the vibrating motion. I believe this is for babies that are a little more older. I gave this to her when she was 4 months since she keeps on sticking items in her mouth.
2,"Great idea, but son is scared of it","I thought this would be great for my teething baby, but the vibration freaks him out. He wants nothing to do with it. =( It might be a wonderful product for other babies, though! It appears to be well-made."
4,a little big for such little hands and mouths.,"I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile. The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide. It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out, at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other. Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her. But don't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy."
3,Nice simple fun teether. Only wish the battery lasted longer or was replaceable,Our 5 month old totally enjoyed it for the 3-4 weeks that the battery lasted (with very minimal use too!)While she still enjoys it - wish the design was a bit more consumer friendly with regards to being able to recharge (or replace) the battery and/or lasting longer.Now it is like just any regular teether except a tad bit more expensive.
4,Good toy to have in teething collection...,"I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it's a smart packaging extra to have the 'free ring' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!!!!,"I have 3 boys, the youngest being 3 months. I have had this toy for each of them during their teething times and it's downright magical. I just ordered a new one for my baby so I'll have it when his teething woes start. This is a great gift for any infant or expectant mom."
3,Star toy,"It Seems like it would be a good toy. My daughter doesn't really care for it, she doesn't really play with it."
5,Great teether.,This is teether works great for my son who is teething. It's easy for him to make it vibrate with the 3 individual ends of the star vibrate.
3,dull,"I thought this was the worst of Brin's novels. I was interested and engaged, then found the ending dull and dissatisfying. A rewrite of the last few chapters would have made this as fun to read as his other works."
3,Different from the average Brin,"If you've been waiting for more stories like those in Brin's uplift saga, then this novel isn't going to be very satisfying. I found Kiln People to be a morality play with a thin SF disguise, dubious science, an unexciting plot, and some smarter-than-average word plays. Not bad, but not what I look for in a Brin novel.I think Brin has written some excellent, perceptive, and even enjoyable non-fiction related to the effects of technology on society. I find his straight non-fiction much more compelling than Kiln People. (Plus most of it is on the web for free.)So, in summary, if you loved Startide Rising et al, get this from the library and save your money. On the other hand, if you've been dying for the next Nancy Kress ""let's use mediocre SF to explore a social issue"" novel, you should buy this immediately."
2,half good,"The first half of this book is quite good. It's an interesting view of a society which differs from ours primarily through the ability of its residents to program their personality and knowledge into autonomous ""dittos"" made of a sort of clay. Setting a mystery in this society is a fine way to bring out its interesting points.But then the book segues into the one that Brin apparently really wanted to write, about ""soulistics"" and how consciousness actually exists in some metaphysical form related to (but apparently distinct from?) quantum mechanics. This is just NOT interesting (speaking as someone who knows a fair amount about quantum mechanics, and has thought a fair amount about consciousness). And it's tedious even for the characters in the book, much less for the reader, to sit through all the speechifying about it.Come to think of it, even recommending half of the book is too much. Read just ""Part I"", then call it quits."
2,I liked the first half . . .,"I saw a copy of this book at the bookstore, and after flipping through it, ordered it from the public library. Thankfully. I loved the concept, and enjoyed the first few chapters. Once I'd reached the halfway point, however, I began to feel restless, an unusual thing for me when I'm reading. I suddenly realized that I wanted the book to be over. It felt finished, and as if the plot should be wrapping up, but there was still half a book to plow through. If you really want to read this book, I'd recommend saving a few bucks and checking it out of the public library."
5,The Edge of Extreme,"David Brin's imagination seems limitless, and this book is proof of that. Brin immerses the reader in a what could be called make-believe, yet he does it with such authority, the fantastical becomes reality. (Reminiscent of his 1980s book The Practice Effect).This story is really a mystery--with a detective caught in the middle of mega-buck bio-engineering intrigue. His character is multifaceted because in this future time, people can duplicate themselves with ease. Imagine producing full size replicates--clones, if you will--and deciding which of your qualities and mental attributes the creature will exhibit. These replicates are the KILN PEOPLE, and Brin's protagonist has several of them.Kiln People is worth the read if only for the ingenious story line. Some readers might find the story (clones withstanding) gets too far flung in its resolution. But when a writer starts his story on the edge of extreme, where else can he take it except Far Out!?"
3,fair take on fun topic,"actually, the thing i liked best about this novel was how uncomfortable it made me. maybe it's because contemporary sf series have become such a marketable product but it's refreshing to read something that explores as well as entertains.or maybe it's because i'm self employed that the whole idea of making cheap copies of ourselves and then putting them to work makes me shudder.but after about 100 pages the story began to feel top heavy. the problem was there were too many clever ideas but not enough character depth to balance them out and keep it feeling real.but it's good to see sf writers jamming on cloning. they're like our temporal sherpas, scouting out paths to the future.another great take on the topic of self copying is 'the wedding album,' written by david marusek. if you have a chance check it out in the 'year's best sf' 1999 volume. definitely a writer worth keeping an eye on."
3,"Fascinating Idea, Oblique and Disjointed Execution",This book starts with the most wonderful concept of disposable affordable extra bodies that work for you and in fact even inhabit separate communities dedicated to their activities. But for some reason Brin impresses on this background a kind of stupid film noir approach and a weird cosmological mad-scientist-tries-to-destroy-the-universe-as-we-know-it kind of climax. I can't help but wonder why - it must have taken a lot of work to come with a treatment so obnoxious. Perhaps others will investigate this great SF idea with better results.
2,Gumby Soul is metaphysics not science,"A clay fiber that can act like a muscle isn't possibleby today's science and probably not by tomorrow's either.A clay that will form neural networks that can learn is even less scientific.So instead of science we have the metaphysics of ""souls""as quantum mechanics. The characterization is beautifuland the permutations of personalities is very well done.The book is after all entertainment, but it is unlike most of Brin's work,not really science fiction; more in the line of metaphysical speculationabout the nature of intelligent waveforms."
3,A ditto's guide to life the universe and everything,"WEDNESDAY MORNING'S POINT OF VIEWIn a meeting with the boss, while my rig sits at home reading this book which is about ME! But thems the breaks, dittos don't complain, there's no time really, when you only live for one day.This meeting is really getting on my nerves, i feel an bearable urge to go to the park. I think I WILL go to the park. Oops, i'm out in the park- oh! does this mean I am a frankie? Sigh!Meanwhile my rig is still reading this book- which i really should get my hands on. But only if I can read the whole thing in one day. If only life extension for dittos was being developed... but there are ethical reasons for that.Might as well go see some people. Oh dear, someone is trying to kill us. But I am only a dit.Woah, this is getting really strange. All the rules don't apply. I'm confused, this really shouldn't happen to a dit. Am I a hero? Who's the hero? Who is God? Where is God?Ah- should have stayed home and read this book instead!"
1,Yawn - couldn't keep awake for this one,"Sorry but I just don't agree with the high score reviews posted here. I think the overall premise of people of clay just a little too silly. Maybe it's because I was reading it in bed and was too tired/disinterested to follow the plot well enough, but this is the only book that I haven't finished for a very long time."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Strangely unsatisfying for a Brin work, although an interesting idea, the clay copies part. Perhaps for a mystery/murder type book this is a bit on the long side, so that is part of the problem. Definitely lighter in tone than a lot of his other novels, or less serious, although not without serious implications."
2,Disappointing,Came in dry caps. Guess I didn't read the fine print. You have to have a fat or oil to absorb. I have to make a special effort to make sure I take with fish oil or other fat. The product designers should know this and make only a softgell with oils to help absorb.
1,Pretentious waste of time,"Van Til was supposedly the intellectual big gun of hyper-conservative Calvinism. If this is the best that fundamentalist Calvinism has to offer as an intellectual defense of its worldview, it's in big trouble. There's far more substance in J. I. Packer, Richard Pratt, J. Gresham Machen, or R. C. Sproul.Stylistically, the book is of remarkable clumsiness."
4,A good work of honesty,"I had to read this for my theatre department at school. But as I did I found that through the course of this play, Brecht gives a sense of honesty in all of the chracters. Weather that honesty is good or bad, it is a truthfull play that brings forth many aspects of seraching for what is good and bad."
1,Redefines awful!,"A pedantic pace and (to my ear) off key vocals that drone on endlessly. I suppose if you like Wally Pleasant you might like this record, but it goes into my ""sell"" pile after only one listening."
4,Great not greatest...,"Well, this is most definitely a useful resource, especially when playing in the Third Edition rules. But it isn't great. Sure, you can customize weapons REALLY well, but in a lot of places the book is just DRY. It's nice to have some updated combat rules, but who really needs more RULES? And even though they give detail to each type of weapon and such, it's not totally enthralling. So, this book is good, but it could have been a lot better."
1,Very Best of... what?,"Decent sounding collection, standard '60s R&B ... but when it was recorded is anyone's guess. Booklet includes NO RECORDING INFORMATION. There is a short essay that provides little insight. Import from Netherlands and/or Germany."
4,Identifying with Boundaries,"I was having a hard time with learning about my boundaries. This book has guided me in the right direction. I would recommended it for people who are learning about boundaries and keeping them. This has helped me to present to my friends in our healing circle, and to pass this book along to them, to see if they can identify with the presentations in this wonderful book."
3,"Good book, but mistitled","This book has many good points in it, but it really doesn't seem to be about boundaries. This book seems to say ""If you love yourself, then your boundaries will automatically form"" and then focuses on how to value yourself. I have no doubt that learning to like and respect oneself will help one to form better boundaries. Alas, I bought this book hoping to learn more about boundaries so I could use them as a new tool to help make ""space"" to like myself better! Oops!At many points, I also felt that the book did a little more ""telling"" than ""showing"", which made it seem a little shallow to me. As another reviewer said, this does offer a good summary of many tips and techniques for how to learn to like and respect oneself, and so it is probably an excellent book to use to get an overview of that topic so you could figure out what to go read in more detail."
1,garbage,I am not taking about the acting or the the production of the film. its actually what I was expecting. But the image quality is that of an old worn out vhs tape. not even a new vhs. but old. shame of the company that brought this to dvd in this poor quality.
4,if u still cant decide read this,In u nut shell its like this...yes the package looks like it came outta the 90s ...... yes the quality of picture especially by todays standard is poor vhs at best maybe even pre 80s and its sometimes jus plain hard to see whats goin on...and audio is what it is..why? I have no clue ...but yes it kinda sux. At the end of the day though this movie is awesome and i could watch it 100 times more than the 2011 version of today so four stars for jus being great even though quality is poor.and if they never again release it on dvd im grateful to have this copy at least and would buy another if released again with a better everything.
2,Poor Release,I have been waiting for this movie for sometime. Pre-release rumors stated that there would be extras including a commentary by director Albert Pyun plus some extra scenes. What we get is no extras and film that looks like it was recorded straight from an old VHS tape. I am glad this was finally released but I wish it would have been more than this poor quality DVD-R.
1,Captain America VHS.,"I had the opportunity to see Captain America on Hulu. I feel it's an Horrible Adaption, Red Skull looks Horrible and is a Businessman?!? Although Steve Rogers/Cap is good, and the costume is good. The Beginning of the movie is in Italian no subtitles in mussolini's WWII Italy. I thought the movie had potential. Sadly, This is the only Cap Movie we have for now sadly. As a Captain America Fan we need something better."
1,Not.,"The only good thing about this movie is the costume that Captain America wears, Everything else including the acting, is a one star rating. I guess they were more focused on an image than a good quality movie.Use your moeny on the cartoons instead."
1,Every copy of this movie should be burned,"This straight to video mess is undoubtadly one of the worst comic to film adaptations of all time (yet, not as bad as Batman & Robin). This movie ranks up there with Roger Corman's never released Fantastic Four movie, and long time fans of the Captain America comics, or even those who just have basic knowledge of the character, will be utterly disgusted with this low budget mess. First off, the changing he nationality of the Red Skull from German to Italian is annoying enough, but one look at Cap's (Matt Salinger) rubbers ears on his costume will either make you laugh out loud or cringe in horror. All in all, any discerning comic fan should avoid this at all costs."
2,Sub Par Super Hero Merchandise,"I love Marvel movies and I will say that Marvel's first big ive action movie hit was Blade in 1998 Less than 6 years after they squatted out this turd. If it was low budget I could understand but this wanna be ""B"" movie of Captain america pails in comparison to the 2011 version. If you really must own this it comes out on 09/13/2011 Be advised it is campy though not as indigestible as the 1960's Cap movies. Watch either the 60's versions or this and you will cheer when they kill off Captain America in the Civil War story lines. Again buy at your own risk as this turd exists only for true collectors or people who want to toture visitors."
3,does this exist,"This is more of a question than a review. I have been waiting for years for this to come to dvd. Its a cult classic in the marvel universe along with the Fantastic Four that never got released and the Dr. Strange movie that was actually a tv pilot. I have been looking forward ever since i saw the posting here on amazon. So the release date comes, and no picture and its all sold out. I check other websites. fye and bestbuy dont even have it listed. Walmart has it for preorder still. So does this thing exist or not. I mean they have numerous reviews online. But does this even really exist or not?"
2,Close...But Not Quite,"There's one good thing about this movie, based on the Golden Age comic-character, the costume! Matt Salinger, in costume, LOOKS like Captain America (at least a lot more than Reb Brown did in the motorcycle-outfit from the 1970's Captain-America made for tv movies.)That's about it. The Red-Skull isn't German anymore, there's no Bucky Barnes, & as portrayed in the movie, Cap had only ONE mission during World War Two. (He's supposed to have had an illustrious career as a spy-smasher up till the end of the European War.)Oh well. I don't mind if the screen-writers take liberties with the original stories. After all, Sam Raimi took a few for the recent ""Spider-Man"" movie. But ""Captain-America"", with the exception of the costume, is way off from the original.Hopefully, now that Stan Lee has more clout in Hollywood because of the recent ""Spider-Man"" movie, maybe they can try again with ""Cap""...and this time...get it right!"
1,B-movie,"Just skip this captain america movie. The acting is more like the old power-rangers tv series, than a 1940's era hero."
1,Awful Beyond Imagination,"I bought this thinking I would at least get a widescreen transfer for the DVD. No such luck. This is a washed out laserdisc rehash that's 4:3 (full frame) instead of 16:9 (widescreen). What a disappointment.(I knew how godawful the movie was, and I knew I'd be getting a DVD-R manufactured-on-demand. None of that deterred me. But I at least thought it would be better than a 20-year-old VHS transfer. THAT's my complaint.)"
5,Great,Captain America is a great Movie of all time and just love it how he throw that Sheild and his Custom Rock
2,Captain America...,"Well Captain America is a low budget movie based on a comicbook superhero. This was another one of those bad Marvel movies that was never re-leased to theatres and has found it's way to home video. This movie is right up there with such classics as the never released Fantastic Four and The Punisher movies. I you like these two movies you'll like this one. If you haven't seen these movies you should check out the much better Superhero movies such as Batman, Superman, The Hulk, X-Men, Daredevil, Blade and Swamp Thing."
3,TV Niveau,"Picture Quality is just TV niveau from 90 but OK so far and fullscreen 4:3.Of course, its not really well made but has trash factor and Red Skulls (Scott Paulin) Mask is interesting made.Sadly (like each DVD-R Release) contains none english subtitles.Fazit: Interesting, for a trash evening good, not the best movie but better than the 1979 TV version."
3,"Not the quality of the 1989 Batman, but entertaining!","Matt Salinger does a great job as Captain America, but the supporting cast is very easy to forget. The movie bites off more than it can handle, trying to explain CA's origin and add a current plot, but the film is still enjoyable and entertaining. The main problem is that most action takes place with CA in his civilian roll; there really isn't much action as Captain America. With a little more money in cast and effects this movie could have been a classic; instead it is simply a good way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon."
4,Fun low budget movie,This movie is very entertaining despite it's bad reputation. It is well acted and much better than other super hero movies that have gone to the theaters. If they would have had a better budget for the costume and special effects it could have been a great movie. Fun stuff for a Captain America fan.
1,Captain America review,Captain America in this film is nothing more then a punching bag and a wimp. The story is boring as the Pagemaster. The production values is so 1970's. Redskull in this film lost some credibility as a villian when he put on some new human skin. The female lead & the rest of the cast are forgettable. I give this movie a 1 out of 10.
3,Dash Diet,"It works very well if it is followed, but sometimes things listed are not available in all areas. I have, however lost 8 lbs. in the past 3 weeks, so will continue using it as a guideline, and watching the calorie count."
3,Content is Great; Binding is Poor,"The DASH Diet Action Plan is an easy-to-read, commonsense guide to getting your diet on track to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. The book includes some simple, but tasty sounding recipes that I plan to try, and sample menus are given for 1200, 1600, and 2000 a day diets. There is even space, workbook style, for you to include your own notes for your personalized action plan. The last presents a problem, though, because this paperback binding is so poor that the book fell apart the first day I began writing in it. The information in this text is excellent, but I suggest finding the book in a hardcover format if you really plan to use this book as a how-to manual."
1,The best I can say is that there are words on every page.,"The author of this book may have sincerely wanted to spread information about an important approach to combating hypertension -- or she may have wanted to make money by recycling readily available information. Unfortunately the important content would fill about 3 pages and is information that is easily found on the internet. Her writing wanders, she repeats herself, and she includes pages and pages of superfluous ""menu plans"", tables and charts that are of no practical value. Save your money! I should have. She is probably a lovely lady but her book could have been a pamphlet."
3,common sense,The book is written well. It reminds us of basics we have forgottennow that there are so many choices out there. The food pyramid theoryis as solid as ever.
3,understanding the dash diet,"I was very disappointed that the book only had a few recipes in it. It had a month of menus, but very few recipes. It was listed as a recipe book. Very disappointing."
1,Common Sense,I bought this book for a close friend that has borderline high blood pressure. The book would be fine for a person that does not know how to eat a well balanced diet. If you already have this information the book is not for you. You can obtain a pamphlet from your doctor about the DASH diet. If I had looked at this book at a bookstore I would not have bought it.
3,DASH Diet Action Plan,"The book was OK, but I thought it would be more of a workbook than it is. There are a few pages to fill, but not what I expected."
2,Not the easiest to read,Not sure what I was expecting - some parts do maek sense but other parts are very confusing. I have read several times but I have that more knowledge can be obtained on the internet then through the book.
3,dash,"information is good, but find it hard to follow this book on kindle as there are a lot of charts and tracking and I find it probably would be more useful in hard copy."
2,Save Your Money,"This book is a big disappointment. One can download the same information and more for free from the DASH.com website or the nhlbi.nih.gov website. (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute) This book does not offer much more than what you can already get online. Save your money, there is plenty of free information online regarding this diet."
3,Dash Diet,"This book was a little disappointing because it did not offer much in the way of continuity. It skipped all over and rreally didn't offer any new information.Since I am already familiar with the Dash Diet, I expected this newer edition to offfer more."
5,Amazing Book,I was very pleased ordering this book the way I did. There were no complaints on getting. I got the book when they said I would get it and was able to track it aas it came to me. Would order a book that way again if I have to.
2,The dash diet action,"I simply made a wrong choice. Although the content is not bad, I feel like I do not really need this book."
3,Dash Diet Action Plan Review from Amazon shopper,"Good common sense book reminds reader of things they should already know and if not, then it gives a fairly decent outline of the plan. Personally I prefer a more flexible eating style and am unable to consume a few key food items due to allergies, which is not addressed."
5,Science and Creativity - A Great Combo for Lifestyle Change,"This is a great book - it hits the balance between being grounded in the best science around, yet it is easy and fun to follow. I can see from other reviews that people are using the recipes and the plans. As a dietitian and health educator, the sort of self-tests and forms in this book give people an easy way to track how they're doing, or even to learn their baseline. If you struggle with cholesterol or high blood pressure, this is a great addition to your bookself (just remember not to let it rest on the shelf too much!)."
2,Little New or Detailed Information,"I was looking forward to some real informative details concerning the methods to follow the DASH diet plan. Upon reading this book, it was very basic information and offered little new information or details for a eating plan. I expected more from the primary book defining this diet format."
5,The Dash Diet Action Plan,I found this book to be one of the best out. I have bought them all but this was the most helpful. Truly love it. Would highly recommend it to everyone.
1,Not a new edition!,"I bought this book because it was advertised as a new edition. It is not; it is simply a reprinting with a new cover and some new graphic layout. It is essentially the same as the previous (2005) edition of the book...word for word. In a few cases the wording has been changed, but it obviously wasn't proofread since the incorrect reference to the recipes (""Many of the menus include recipes that are located in chapter 14."") is still in this ""edition"". (The menus are located in chapter 16, not 14.) I agree with other reviewers that ALL of this information can be found on the Internet. The dashdiet.org site is simply advertisement for this book. A much more helpful site is [...] or any of the many other sites that can be accessed by searching ""Dash Diet"" in Google. If you are looking for menus, google ""Dash Diet menus""."
4,A light in the darkness,"Marla Heller has made my lifelong uphill battle, more intellectual (rather than emotional), more scientific (rather than the latest fad), and more life long habbit (rather than short term success)."
5,Very informative and practical book,The contents of the book are easy to read and follow. And the process works!
4,"Good information, but why should we pay twice?","It's good to see our federal tax dollars used for research that is useful. However, if my tax dollars are used to support this type of research, why do I have to pay for that information? I'm going to purchase the book, but I'm having a problem with paying for information that my tax dollars supported initially. Again, this information should be available for free."
2,Get it from the Library for free!,"I didn't find this book that useful. Eat healthy.. that is what it says.. ok! Personally, I didn't think it pointed out anything that any human shouldn't already know."
2,Nothing new,There's nothing new in this diet. Just the same old boring stuff rehashed. I was very disappointed and am certainly not tempted to follow it.
4,JUST WANNA CONTROL THE PRESSURE,"I'M TRYING TO CONTROL MY BLOOD PRESSURE THAT HAS GONE UP THIS LAST YEAR OR SO BY FOLLOWING THE DASH DIET & AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT. WAS TAKING A MILD DIURETIC - DID NOT SEEM TO WORK, THEREFORE, READING THROUGH THE DASH DIET BOOK - HAS TERRIFIC INFORMATION - STILL WAITING TO SEE IF IT'LL WORK. THE BOOK STATES TO DEFINITELY EAT 'WHOLE FOODS' LIKE LOTS OF FRUITS & VEGGIES & FOR SURE LOW SODIUM. THE BOOK IS GREAT FACTS & MATERIALS BASED ON SO-CALLED 'PROVEN RESULTS'. I CAN'T WAIT TO LOWER THE PRESSURE HOPEFULLY WITHOUT MEDICATIONS."
4,DASH-DIET,"The book is interesting and has a lot of how to's, recipes and helps that will make it easy to use...We'll see what the lab results are in a month or so..."
3,DASH DIET,"""THE DASH DIET"" has lots of common sense knowledge and great receipes for a good healthy eatimg meal We are enjoying it at our house."
5,Valuable,Great tool for controlling high blood pressure. I really like the menues included. Easy to fix and very tasty. Information very helpful in getting you on the right track.
3,Dash diet action plan,"This book is so-so. Most of the info you can find on the NIH site or Dash site on line. The menus are nothing to rave about--and the recipes are not very inspiring. The only good thing is you can go on line with a site they have to download charts to keep records of weight, blood pressure, etc."
1,dash diet action plan,"What a dissapointment! The amaturish writing and repetition paragraph to paragraph is mind numbing. This book doesn't come close to the one published by the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (free, too). The ""action plan"" proposed is anything but, and the recipies really underline the poor attempt to sell nothing for too much money."
2,Not really worth it,The information in this book can all be found online for free. I was hoping for more recipes and there are very few included. If you are looking for those. the Mayo Clinic web site has a good number.
3,Pretty good,"Some of the recipes were delicious, and some were... well... not. I recommend this anyway because it has helped with me eating healthier but I'm just not used to some of those food choices."
1,Difficult in E form,"While the concept of the book is interesting and good information, the book in E form is very difficult to read and reference back to. This book is better as a hard copy."
3,DASH diet,"I haven't fully read the whole book yet but have started to use the recipes, I find them very easy to follow even though they are in American measures."
1,Dangerous,"Any modern dietary program that promotes the consumption of grain, specifically wheat, is ill-founded. Before utilizing the DASH plan, one should read the new book ""Wheat Belly"". In this work the author joins the chorus of informed doctors and scientists who understand the destructive power of today's grains."
5,More Grouse Feathers by Burton Spiller,A great find! Found it used (an old library copy) and it arrived in pristine condition and in a timely manner. Couldn't be happier.
3,"Interesting, but disappointing also","I am a practicing Mormon, and while many of my religious peers would never be caught reading this type of book, since most of the LDS beliefs she presents as she 'bashes' them, I couldn't wait to dive into it. I was very disappointed in the fact that she gives so little information about the actual massacre, every thing she gives is so 'if-y' and, even if done fictitiously, I kept waiting to read more about the massacre, maybe from the women who dis-robed the bodies, or even more from the trial, anything to shed light on the subject to which I thought the book was about. Instead you will read much about (what the author portrays as) a sexually obsessed family and the need for their husband's approval. It was interesting, although again I will say, not at all what I expected. Let all readers beware it is a work of fiction, and in no way portrays Mormon doctrine as it is lived today."
3,Red River flounders in short end of creek,"I attended a series of lectures partially funded by the Utah Arts Council. A liberal group of elitist decision makers that I have not always agreed with for reasons not to go into here.I saw Judith Freeman and was surprised by the clamor about her book. Just a few weeks earlier I met an extremely talented writer who had written a book called ""The Ferry Woman"". Published by Limerlost press. Ferry woman is a book written by a male author with remarkable insight into the thoughts of a woman. I will not go into Ferry Woman. You can check out the reviews.I found the premise Red River to be similar to the Ferry Woman . The story to move a bit slow at times and the story was written to attract more og a romance type audience. It is not a literary maserpeice by any means.In my view, I see this book as trying to be a sequal to the Ferry Woman. This is my opinion"
2,This book resembles other,"I have read The Wives Of Short Creek and The Ferry Woman byGerald Grimmett and feel as if i am reading those books when i flip these pages?Is it my imagination or has a big city publisher found a writer to compile a small town publishers books to create her own?Ferry woman will stay on my shelves, this book is yard sale bound."
5,The Consequences of War,"An overriding theme of this book is the impact of war and violence on women. Men wage conflict, yet women are left to deal with the consequences -- some of which last for decades and beyond. A very timely topic often omitted from history."
4,Big pop sound in a convenient package,"I heard this band live in studio on KCRW in Los Angeles, and I thought they were really cool. I love strings, especially real strings, so I immediately knew I would like this CD. They have a retro 70's pop sound with a big piano/strings feel. You feel like their concerts should really be performed in a symphony hall and not in a traditional rock concert setting. I often hear country flairs in this music as well. Wilco is probably a good comparison. Even Tahiti 80 if you mellow it out and take away the electronic influence.This is not the most innovative music out there, but it has a home and is unique, especially for this era in music history. This is a great band, and for those of you missing mellow pop music, hop in your red flame decaled thunderbird and go for a road trip with your new Chamber Strings CD."
5,Didn't Mean to Pick it Up (Couldn't Put it Down),"I bought this book in the ""on sale"" part of Amazon one day, because it was the cheapest book that could get me over the ""free shipping"" hump. I thought, ""It sounds alright -- maybe I'll find time to read it one day.""Well that one day happened while I was rearranging furniture last week. Dress Codes fell out of my bookshelf so I picked it up and said, ""Huh! I forgot all about this book!"" I sat down on my office chair and flipped to a random page in the book to see if it was any good. Six hours and a damn good story later, I went to bed.The book weaves an interesting twist of biographical stories from the view point of her parents as children, along with her own childhood story. She explores the characters in her family with depth and humor. Each chapter leaves you hungry for more.Enjoy the author's communist grandfather, socialite grandmother, goes-along-with-anything mom, and her grumpy dad with his humorous efforts to prove his masculinity!"
5,An astonishing accomplishment,"What the author has done is not ""merely"" tell her story, one that might scandalize some readers, extremely well, but has also achieved something quite singular, made more amazing by her youth. Howey shares her family saga -- at times heart-rending, hilarious, and always heartfelt -- all the while in total control of her emotions, in a memoir that revels in the lives of its subjects. Never maudlin nor preachy, trite or Prozac Nation-esque, Dress Codes is a truly special book by an author whose mastery of language and story structure will doubtless make her a force to be reckoned with in the future."
3,book review,Interesting topic written lightly and with no holds barred. It is a fast read and worth the time.
3,Old West Mayhem,"Don't read this book....unless you're prepared to read the ton of otherbooks in the ""Smoke Jensen and Preacher"" series. This author writes a bookbefore breakfast and another just before dinner. They're plentiful andhighly addictive. Suspend belief and enjoy.Smoke Jensen, in particular, shoots or fist fights around a hundredhard cases per book and they all highly deserve the mayhem he delivers.In spite of this high fiction (most famous old West gunfighters onlykilled 3 or 4 men in their entire lives) you'll soldier on with theseries because Smoke Jensen is the stuff heros are made of and thewriting is crisp and moving.Just don't say you weren't warned when you find that you spent your wholesummer (or winter) in a comfy chair with 50 or so of these read booksstrewn around you."
4,revenge of the mountain man,Condition was as stated when we bought the book. Very good and proud to have it. Have finally finished the complete set. Thanks to all for your help.
1,DISAPPOINTED TOO,"I agree with the disappointed reviewer. I had hoped for something better...I now assume that most of the reviews were written by THE AUTHOR, HER FAMILY, HER FRIENDS. This is a generic rehash of the type of ""romance"" NOVEL THAT MAKES PEOPLE cringe. I like Abigail but Spencer got on my nerves. He is the type of man no woman should get involved with. The fact that Abugail fell in love with him is too unbelievable for me. Better luck next book"
3,It's ok,I have to say I was a tad disappointed in this book. It had its high points but I have to say it lacked a certain something. It seemed to lack any real finesse. Too bad the Swanlea Sisters books had to end on this bland note.
3,So -so,"The sex scenes didn't quite fly; they lacked a certain sizzle. And, as another reviewer pointed out, there were certain modern expressions that were jarring to the story. ""I'm giving you an out"" is one that comes to mind -- I'm quite certain that such an expression would not have been used in early 19th century England."
2,"Nope, Not Worth It","This book was very disappointing. What could have been an incredibly clever vehicle and plot (the proxy marriage by the meddling younger brother) was a waste of a good idea in this novel. The characters were wooden and too concerned with one another's physical beauty, and the dialogue was unnatural and didn't flow. I was more intrigued by the minor characters (the brother and his fiance) than I was by the main characters. Not a ringing endorsement."
5,They Hanged My Saintly Billy,"An excellent book - crime and history both. It makes the reader wonder if William Palmer could, indeed, have been innocent. Very well written."
3,URBAN RAMBO,"STEELE JUSTICE is definitely a movie from the 80s; from its ""hip"" score to its post-Vietnam stigma, this action movie serves up a Death Wish type of vigilantism.Martin Kove (Cagney and Lacey, Karate Kid, Barbarian) plays the studly hero, John Steele, who still fights the Vietnam war in his post-military life. A disgraced cop, he now works as a horsecar driver, until a shadowy figure from his past (played with devilish abandon by Soon Tek Oh) shows up. Enter (again), Steele's luscious ex-wife (a pre-SISTERS Sela Ward), and the daughter of his best friend, whose family was killed (a whiny Jan Gan Boyd), and you have all the standard ingredients in place.Kove does well with his macho role, and there are decent action scenes and an appropriate ending, so action fans won't be too disappointed."
3,Enjoyable but typical vigilante thriller.,"Martin Kove (The Karate Kid) stars as ex-Vietnam military man John Steele, who sets out on a mission of vengeance when his best friend and his family are massacred by the sadistic Vietnamese mafia.Other than a couple minor quirks here and there (ie the hero has a pet snake, the movie has a notable cast, etc), this is a pretty typical vigilante action movie. Having said that though, it's still not a bad way to kill an hour and a half. Kove plays a likable but flawed good guy, there's lots of explosions and gunfire, and a number of goofy cliches including a training montage (!). Worthwhile, but only for really avid action film buffs."
2,Not as helpful as his Spain book- very confusing maps,"We did not like Rick's Portugal book but loved his Spain book. **We used it for Lisbon only** Perhaps other cities are easier to navigate but we had trouble with his maps and it was hard to follow his suggested walks through the city. We did figure everything out eventually, it was just not as well laid out as the Spain book- I think having another book or more detailed maps might have been more helpful. (I think he does suggest getting another city map upon arrival- I just find it annoying to have a book and a huge map while wandering around- his Spain book was nice in that we only needed the book).Even if he had a map section at the end with more details, it would have been nice. I'm not sure why he uses maps that look like they were drawn, as if by hand, instead of using an actual map in his books... they're cute/quaint to look at but horrible for directions."
1,Outdated Information,"Judging by the introduction to this book it is hard to believe that Rick Steves has actually set foot in Portugal during the last 20 years let alone 2005. The statement right at the start of the Intro, that the ""roads are rutted"" is a ludicrous. I have been travelling regularly to Portugal since 1965 and can guarantee that the main (toll) roads in Portugal are now some of the best highways in the world. They are certainly better engineered and constructed than any of the highways in the US Interstate system. The secondary roads are also generally well maintained although crowded at times. This one totally outdated piece of information alone casts doubt on the validity of the rest of the information in the book. I would recommend looking elsewhere fo more accurate information."
3,Portugal,"I am sure the book was just fine, but I sent it back-we changed our mind about going to Portugal."
5,Rick Steve's pulls through again!,I was on a cruise & used this guide for my visit to Lisbon. I followed his walks around the town & he was spot on for everything. I wish he covered more sites in some of the countries he visits such as Spain. He doesn't cover all the places I visited but the ones he covers are great. Highly recommend him for his writing style & information.
4,"Good info, not much detail","Generally speaking, I like Rick Steve's book. This one is consistent with good information. However, in places I wanted more detail. We did try out some of his restaurants and they were great, as he said. Good book."
2,Very brief outline of major sites only,"The Rick Steves' Portugal guidebook provides only the barest information about places to visit. It covers the major sites only. This was my first intro to it having used the Frommer's and Fodor's for other European places. The RS writers make periodic attempts at wry humor which have a decided political bias, like reading usual newspapers from the USA, they amounted to little more than moral posturing for the reader. For travelers with any real interest in visiting sites of historic cultural appeal, this may not be your guidebook. I can't imagine ever purchasing another from the series."
3,SICK PRODUCTION---GARBAGE FLOW,"IF YOU CAN REMEMBER HOLOCAUST FROM THE WUTANG SWARM CD U WOULD RECALL HE HAD THE SICKEST VERSES ON BOTH SONGS HE WAS ON...HE WAS ON POINT WITH LYRICS AND DELIVERY, BUT OVER THE YEARS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM. HIS LYRICS HAVE BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE ECCENTRIC MEANING MANY TIMES NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT. AND HIS DELIVERY HAS BECOME WORSE THAN SILK THE SHOCKER(MASTER P'S BROTHER)...HE SOUNDS LIKE HE RAMBLES A LOT AND HIS FLOW IS OFF BEAT IN MANY INSTANCES. THIS ALBUMS PRODUCTION OF DARK BEATS IS SICK AS ANY BUT HOLOCAUSTS RHYME DELIVERY IS JUST OFF PUTTING. I COULD ONLY IMAGINE IF BLUE SKY BLACK DEATH GRABBED CANIBUS OR APATHY INSTEAD OF WARCLOUD THIS ALBUM WOULD HAVE HAD RAVE REVIEWS...AND MAYBE WARCLOUD SHOULD STICK TO GHOST WRITING BECAUSE HIS FLOW IS ABSOLUTE POO."
2,Pay attention to the Dimensions,"This picture is misleading, especially if you make the mistake as i did, of not paying attention to the dimensions, which is given as a whopping 3.2 ounces. Buy a soft bristled toothbrush instead (it's about the same size), and save your money."
4,Hard to find information.,This book provides easy to understand information on several useful electronic components. Many of the newer components are much more complex and in most cases - overkill. I believe this book is a good value for anyone that needs this level of technical information.
5,Great Book for the beginner,I still have this book and have read some things to better understand electronics from a basic point of view. Now I'm going to college and by reading it I understand what's going on in my Automotive electronics class. A+ for being well written!
5,Great book,I absolutely loved this book! Betty Eddie once again has taken her near death experience to new heights! Her style of writing is easy to read & understand! This book really helps us to understand how our thoughts & actions affects other people.
5,The Ripple Effect: Our Harvest,What a wonderful sequel to Betty Eadie's first two books. It gives me a whole new look at my life and my blessings.
1,Calling All Editors!,"While I usually enjoy books of this particular genre, Betty J. Eadie's ""The Ripple Effect"" was disturbing. She describes the death of her baby daughter from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in heartbreaking terms. The scene in the book touched me deeply - until I happened to describe it to an expert on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, who said, ""What she is describing is physically impossible."" Who EDITS some of these books anyway? Who PUBLISHES these books without at least doing enough preliminary checking of the facts to see how plausible the events described within really are?"
2,"Poor Overseas mode, not reliable","This fax has the following draw backs:1) Poor Overseas mode. I've tried 10 different fax numbers in the following countries: France, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Sweden and there was always a 'comm.error' message.2) It can't hang up if errors occur. If there is a problem in a fax transmission, this fax won't hang up/free the phone line.3) It has a very 'fragile' construction (paper holder is a joke)4) You won't be able to use it as a printer in network mode (ethernet connection and, probably, USB). So called 'printer drivers' are not optimized for Windows XP and you will get a lot of 'can't communicate with printer' errors.I'd suggest to stay away from this fax. Canon L80 might be a better solution if you can invest more in a fax machine."
4,Good but not great,We wanted an all in one unit for faxing and messages for our home office. This one appeared to fill the bill. It's compact and the quality of the printing is good. LCD is hard to read and the controls are clunky. Still a good deal for the money.
1,caution,"Compared to others, this looked like a really good fax machine, features, price, etc. It had decent reviews.However, I have now had 2 units sent to me with the same problem-the phone on-hook/off-hook mechanism is defective.Perhaps this machine doesnt survive shipping well...On the plus side, Amazon has been helpful, I am now returningthis 2nd unit."
4,6 year old loves cartoons,My son loves cartoons and we do alot of traveling the videos help to keep him entertained.
3,So-so.......,"This is a must for traveling! Buying these will most likely keep your child entertained on a long trip, on a budget.Sound quality sucks like crazy, and the picture quality is NOTHING like it is in the picture! Beware!"
2,Book was a little too slow,"I found this book a rather slow read. And I got tired rather quickly of the touch me, touch me not problems of Susannah, they just went on for far too long. I liked Reed, the Aunts and the pets, thats why I gave it 2 star, without them, the plot and Susannah wouldn't even have rated a single star. I would get this book at the library and save your money."
3,felt like 2 separate books............,"THE FIRST HALF OF THIS BOOK PLODDED AND PLODDED. IT WAS ALL TALK, TALK, AND I HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE GETTING THRU IT BUT SOMEHOW THE BACK COVER HAD BEEN SO PROMISING SO I HUNG WITH IT. THE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK WAS WONDERFUL. IT EXPLAINED THE CHARACTERS TORMENT AND BROUGHT ALL THEISSUES INTO THE OPEN AND , WELL, IT WAS WONDERFUL.............I AM GLAD I DIDN'T JUST TOSS THIS EARLY ON BUT IT WAS TOUCH AND GO FOR AWHILE.....NOT TOO INTERESTED IN FURTHER BKS BY THIS AUTHOR BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE."
2,weak,I read most of this author's books and in my opinion this one lacked depth or inspiration. I wonder if Ms. Jeffries herself derived any pleasure from writing it.
2,Disappointed...,I have read this author before and enjoyed her books. This one was (sadly) disappointing especially in light of the fact that I was so looking forward to it. I just didn't *believe* any of it. The plot was contrived and the characters were hollow. Don't *tell* me about the characters and their feelings. *Show* me what the characters are like by their actions. This one just didn't ring true for me. I rarely don't finish a book but sadly put this one down. I don't like feeling that I'm being talked down to by romance authors. I'm always looking for authors who actually give me some credit. I can figure out what's going on in a story by following the action. I don't need it spelled out to me so simplistically. Read and enjoy her other books.
4,Third Book of the Swanlea Spinster Series,"After the Abduction is the story of what happens two years after Morgan Pryce kidnaps Juliet. Now two years later there are rumors about the kidnapping. Juliet's, her sister and brother-in-law decide to find Morgan Pryce and stop all the rumors. Lots of sub-plots, great romance and a duel. Check out the whole Swanlea Spinster series; Book 1: A Dangerous Love, Book 2: A Notorious Love, Book 3: After the Abduction, Book 4: Dance of Seduction and Book 5: Married to the Viscount."
3,Parts were good...parts fell flat.,"Sebastian is the lord of a great manor, a man of responsiblity, a man of character, who in one desperate moment two years prior abducted Lady Juliet. Lady Juliet was tricked by a man whom she found attractive, who wisked her off suppossedly to Gretna Green only to realize along the way that it was just an ""regular"" abduction to use her in a plot to save Sebastian's twin brother Morgan. During this time they obviously make an impression on each other because when they meet again the sparks fly. I only thought this book deserved three stars because I was frustrated with some of the arguements. I was siding more often with Sebastian, who seemed sensible and less often with Juliet--her sides of the arguement were unreasonably childish. Also the lying that Sebastian, Lady Rosland (a supporting character, Juliet's sister) did bothered me quite a bit as well."
1,Keep away from this book!!!,"When i started reading ""after the abduction"" by Jeffries, i have to admit i was into it, it started off goood but once it got to page 82, it was downhill from there and even worse as the book continued, i had to force myself to finish the book, which is so unlike me, just because i wanted to see if Jeffries will redeem herself, i cant see why since the book was dull and unbelievable. The reasons she made up to make him confess he was truly her kidnapper (like he tutoring her to 'recognize scoundrels') and the way he convinced her to make love to him was so unreal! The heroine could have come up with a more convincing plan and they're arguements were so dumb. Trust me - stay away from this book! If all of Jeffries other books are anything like ""After the abduction"" and ""the dangerous lord,"" quit now!"
3,One peron's Opinion,"THE INSTITUT proved to be a difficult read that, at times, seemed to be confusing. However, I found myself reading (and at times re-reading) the next page to find out what would happen to Monsieur Defont and the cocky Dr. Martine. It did prove thought provoking in providing a possible explaination to our existence and the religion(s) that the world's population holds so dear. I was somewhat captivated by the debunking of the Catholic religion and the many atrocities they did in ""the name of God."" To say more would give away the ending.I suggest you buy the book and come to your own conclusion to the true nature of God and religion."
1,Didn't work at all.,This product didn't work at all. Very disappointed in this product. Won't buy it again. I don't like wasting money.
4,"Not great, but good. Works well, leaks a little.","This 16 oz.+ capacity cup definitely has more pluses than negatives. Add the milk or liquid first, then add the protein powder, so you won't have sludge on the bottom of the cup. I shake vigorously for 30 seconds-1 minute, depending upon how much protein powder I add, and definitely over the sink, because my cup does leak a little from the side while shaking. A separate screen piece inside breaks up all the clumps very well and the end result is a very smooth, well-blended drink. Mine doesn't leak when I drink from it and the drinking spout works fine. Hand-washes very easily. I wanted a fancier one initially, but now I think that good enough is good enough."
3,"Not that great, Not that bad","This bottle gets the job done, but it could be better. After you shake it up and open the drink spout, there will most likely be powder caught on the spot. There will also be very thick shake at the bottom of it when its almost gone.I think the mian problem is that if you want ot mixed perfect you need a blender."
2,Wouldnt buy again..,"So I bought this about 1-2 months ago..yes it does mix it very well, it didn't leak for a bit. But then the little plastic cover on the cover for the ""vent"" if you may, which allows oxygen in the bottle for ease of quick drinking..cracked so now everytime I shake it, my protein gets all over the bottle and hand..very messy. If you ask me something like this, which mind you does not get alot of abuse should definately last longer. Yes i could just put a finger over it but just goes to show, you get what you pay for."
3,Not bad for price,"It's a very average cup, but because of the price I find it pretty good. Just one note: on the top piece there is a rubber ring inside (where the blue cup screws into, to keep liquids from leaking out). At least once every few washes, I highly recommend removing that rubber ring and cleaning that out as well. After a while of using the cup, and washing it after every single use, I noticed an awful smell. I took out the rubber ring and realized that whatever it is you're mixing sometimes creeps up above the rubber ring and stays there rotting away.So my main complaint is the fact that the rubber ring should more accessible and easier to remove/replace in order to make it more efficient when washing."
1,Don't buy,The little cover that goes over the air vent hole broke after the first use.Don't recommend.
2,Dont waste your money,"The top doesn't close right. It leaks very badly even if you hold it closed. Poor design. If you drink it in the car on the way back from the gym like I do, expect the worst. Although the blades leave little clumps. I would get something else."
1,awful plastic smell,"I purchased a pair of these shaker bottles about a year ago and they constantly stink of plastic. Whatever they're made of, they never smell clean. The material these are made of makes the liquid inside tase of plastic."
2,Terrible..,"Don't buy it, please!This thing has a really awful smell if you leave the top closed. It mixes pretty good, but sometimes it leaks; it's just very poorly designed.I don't recommend it!"
2,Doesn't last very long...,"I was pretty happy with this bottle until it started leaking like crazy after a few months. The biggest leak came from a crack in the smaller vent cap that was most likely caused by repeated pressure to keep the seal tight. Over time, the physics of the design simply causes the plastic to split. If the cap was made of something more elastic like silicone or rubber, this problem probably wouldn't exist. The rest of the leaking seems to be coming from a worn-down rubber seal that lines the inside of the cap. Even though it's sightly more expensive, I'm buying a BlenderBall BlenderBottle to replace my BodyTech bottle."
2,Shaker-----,too hard to close and sometimes you have to close it a few times so it will be tight. And you have to hold the top part everytime you shake it so it won't spill. Good mixer haven't have problem with that.
3,Shaker bottle review,Nice product overall but the vent cap does not fasten securely and is prone to popping off.
1,One of the worse,This was something cheap they made to give out for buying their product. It is just a plain and simple bad product
1,Plastic smell and taste.. Gross,"Awful. Not worth a penny. Drinking stuff that taste like plastic can't be good for you. If you value your health, avoid at all cost."
1,Eh... shop around.,I bought this because I needed something simple to use that was easy to take on the go. It worked nicely for about a month and then the cap that covers the drinking hole broke. now it is worthless and unusable.
2,Works Great til it Breaks,"I bought three of these shakers all around the same time and they worked pretty well. I never had any problems mixing with whey, but my casein would come out a little chunky. I still really enjoyed the bottles with the air vent and the great lip for drinking from though. However, after about 3 months of regular use (using each bottle about twice a week) 2 of the shakers air vent covers had cracked, one actually split in half making the bottles leak quite a bit while I mix my drinks. So now I have 3 bottles with only one working top. In the companies defense I did put them in the dishwasher top rack once a week to make sure they were sanitized."
2,Perfect ride not perfect read,"I admire Gary Stevens as a world class jocky, but world class writer he is not. At times he comes across as quite cocky, maybe he has reason to be proud of his success but he sounds conceited more then proud. Often he writes as though he knows more about the horses he rides then the trainers or owners, that he is a better judge of their capabilities then either of the others, and he has been proven wrong on that score. He also seems to be trying to give us a smattering of his philosophy on success and I think he fails. What has worked for him, a God given ability to ride horses well and an incredible tolerance for pain can not be applied to the rest of us. I have to say, I hope Stevens does not follow this book up with any others. He is a much better jocky then writer."
3,Average,"I've been a Stevens fan since he brought Thunder Gulch home at 24-1 in the 1995 Derby. This book however, is just average at best, even for a Stevens fan. Sure it details his rise to the top of the industry, but it just doesn't flow very well and doesn't have much personality."
5,The Salt Covenant,This Book gives you a good information of the significance of Covenants. It is not uniquely Christian but at the same time contributes enormously to the subject matter. It adds to the subject matter that the God of all creation instituted Covenants.
5,Accurate Tucker Detail,"Paint job looks like real clear coat, very sharp. Detail of engine, trunk, interior, are very good. I have this model in 1/24 scale by another company also and paid a great deal more for that model. However being honest I rate and like this model much better than the other. If you have room for a 1/18 scale model go for this one."
4,Got one instead of a pack of three,"Got one instead of the pack of three as stated. Called amazon and spoke to a really nice lady and they gave me a refund for my missing packs. :DThat said these are awesome stockings. Comfortable, sturdy and nice looking. I love these!"
3,Great story that could have been better,"Bear Bryant and his first training camp at Texas A&M are the stuff of myth and legend. In the hands of a more discriminating writer the real story could have been separated from all the apocrypha. As it is, there is very little insight about the real Paul Bryant. While the players who endured the camp should be the primary focus, I would have liked to know more about all the guys who quit. How do they feel about the Bear and his methods? How could such brutal methods inspire Bryant disciples like Gene Stallings and Jack Pardee? The book does contain some interesting information about the way college football worked in the 1950s e.g. no water breaks, life before scholarship limits and when players had to call their own plays. I was hoping for a more insightful and thoughful book. Recommended for college football fanatics. The ESPN movie based on this book should be entertaining."
3,The Fish Story Of Fish Stories.,"When Gene,""Bebes"" Stallings was asked if he ever got tired oftalking about Junction,he said,""It's like an old fish story:Themore you tell it,the worse it gets."" ""The Junction Boys"" could besummed up as someone's idea of having a bad time at training camp.The story starts with Bear Bryant's arrival in College Station in 1954,and concludes with his passing in 1983.In between,the Aggies go from the bottom of the ash heap,to the top of themountain.The individual stories of the boys,along with therich history of Texas A&M;,make this a book for the ages.It'sthe best sports book that I've read."
3,OK...,"I thought that this book was better than the movie. I saw the movie and was very disappointed. If you guys want a good SEC Book try ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"". I liked it. Junction Boys is okay, I just thought it would be much better."
3,"Great story, average writing.","verdant: 1 a : green in tint or color <verdant grass> b : green with growing plants <verdant fields> 2 : unripe in experience or judgment : GREEN 9a, bRemember that definition as you read this book, it popped up rather frequently for a word rarely used in anybody's vocabulary.I greatly enjoyed the story, though this book will never be comparable to ""Friday Night Lights"". The author had a tendency to do the ""this happened, then that happened"" method of writing and his anecdotes sometimes felt forced.Not to be misunderstood, I'm glad I read it. It is enjoyable for fans of Paul ""Bear"" Bryant, Texas A&M or college football in general. Beyond that audience, however, it will probably leave something to be desired."
4,Excellent Story for the College Football Fan,This book tells the story of how a bunch of college kids survived a hell week with Bear Bryant and went on to win a championship with him. If you enjoy football you will enjoy this story. My only complaints are that Jim Dent has a few too many down home Texas similes. It also would have been interesting to have Dent put the story into a little bit of historical perspective. Not providing water at practice makes Bryant seem cruel in today's terms.
2,Junction Training Camp Not Necessary,"I read this book only for its historical value.I have never liked Coach Paul Bryant because his actions and coaching style were clearly abusive, rude, hostile, disrepectful, confrontational, and brutal. He came close to killing some of his players!The hard part of reading this book are the detailed, graphic injuries sustained by many of the players. It is deplorable how these players were treated by Coach Bryant and his assistants. Coach Bryant almost appears to be sadistic and callous in his attitude toward hurt players."
4,Deep knowledge of Perl,"I thought I have a good knowledge about Perl, but this book changed my mind in first chapter. It's not a intermediate level, and quite difficult if you have not read the ""Learning Perl"". I recommend strongly to read Learning Perl first and fully understand it before start this book. This book talking about a lot of reference and HASH data structure, but I feel like it's not much useful for real life."
4,"Intermediate Perl has good code, good examples",This book has good perl examples and good perl code. It is a good choice if you have an intermediate understanding of the perl language.
4,"Good, but not great","I didn't like the storyline, but I did learn how to handle anonymous arrays better."
2,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"I grew up with Maggi in our household as my parents were from Germany and always had a way of getting the good old ""Maggi Gewürz"" shipped to us and keeping stock in our kitchen. The original seasoning is great, but this one is a little different (trust me I know), it is made in Mexico and for a fact the ingredients are a little different, there are more preservatives in this one than the original, thus the taste is NOT quite the same."
3,"Good effort, but...","I really want to like this album; it sounds like it's right up my alley. On ""Low to the Ground,"" the Waxwings sound like a cross between Wilco and Badfinger, with a little Byrds thrown in. Now, that's not a bad idea at all: a little Beatle action with some country sensibilities. Yet, there's a little bit of a problem: they've got the right look, a nice record cover, some musical and singing talents; decent, bright production; engaging performances. But the hooks aren't very sharp, and I can't remember anything about the songs the moment they're over. They're kind of like an entree that looks and smells terrific, but doesn't have a remarkable taste. Only one song really comes close to blowing me away: ""Sleepy Head."""
5,The happiest album I have ever bought!!,If you want to sit back and listen to great music that will just put a smile on your face then this is it! A friend let me borrow this album and I owned it the next day. It's just that good. I am impatiently waiting for the new album to come out. They are in the studio right now working on it. If you buy this album you will not be disappointed. Rock on people.
5,Superb,"A superb account of the development of the physical model of the Universe culminating in the Newtonian framework. What sets this book apart from others is how Burtt attacks the interplay between the philosophical, social, and religious worldviews characteristics of the time period.Burtt overthrows some of the conceptions still held today that the religious paradigm was the overrdiding impediment to the acceptance of the Copernican framework among the scientific community. Burtt demonstrates how the scientific community of the time had no need to revise the epicycles and deferrents of the ptolemaic scheme. It was only through the argument of greater simplicity and the appeal to the neo-platonic mathematical ideals that it became more widely accepted.A must read for any student of science interested in the complex interplay of ideas that eventually led to the rationale for and acceptance of Newtonian mechanics and the resulting metaphysical framework."
1,Waste of money-dead after just a few hours,"These lights throw a nice light and I heartily recommend LEDs for almost every lighting need. These units, however, are inexpensive for a reason-they are cheap! I got 3 units from Geeks and all three failed in under 20 hours. I don't hold the quality of the product against Geeks-it is for Customer Service failings that I will not do business with Geeks again."
2,Not Very Bright,"Not really what I expected. This bulb does not compare to an incandescent, halogen, or fluorescent light bulb. I would recommend it as an extra bright night light - that's the only use I could come up with after trying it out. It's not bright enough to be used for ambient light."
1,low watt low life,This bulb lasted about two hundred hours and simply died. Not worth the time and trouble to send back.
1,What was I thinking?,"Two word review: ""Chinese quality.""Longer review:I'd bought two of these before, and one was DOA. The other lasted a few weeks. So I bought two more. One died on the first day, and the other has lasted several weeks so far. See the two word review, above, before you buy any of these.These do save energy, though. Once they are dead, they consume zero watts."
4,Good for Fishtanks,"I ordered 2 of these LEDs and put them in my fishtank to cut down on heat for the fish and power draw. Light is extremely blue and not too powerful, because of that I can't think of any other use besides an aquarium."
1,Worst Clamps Ever,These clamps were designed to work for a few times. I bought 6 of them 5 months ago but did not put them to use till recently. I bought 6. They all fail to grip. They are peices of jusnk. There is not warrantly information on these. Stay away from them. They are insult to the name Denali.
3,Good Luck,"This study guide is helpful for one out of three sections of the TEA, the Investigative section. It is helpful in preparing you for general ideas on the test, but when it comes to the test, the questions are different and more difficult!"
1,Don't rely on this book if you want to pass the TEA exam!,"I just wish I had read all these reviews before purchasing this book. I just took the TEA and am in shock. This book in no way prepares you for the math and even the verbal reasoning doesn't match up to what is actually on the TEA exam. I hate to admit this, but because of relying on this study guide alone, I have probably blown my one and only chance to become an ATF Agent. Don't waste your time with this book."
1,Not Worth the Money,"If you plan on spending loads of money for airfare and a hotel in order to get to the TEA test location, save some of the money by not buying this book. The practice exams were fairly simple and the math section was completely unrealistic compared to the actual test. I am by no means a math wizard, but this book portrayed the math section as one of mostly very basic math. The actual test is 10x harder! Ill be buying ARCO's guide (US Marshal test book) for the next time. Several people told me after the exam Arco's math section closely resembled the actual test."
2,Misleading,Poorly written examinations guide. I found it misleading because it did not reflect accurately the reading comprehensive and math sections. If candidates are looking for a study guide then I strongly recommend another text.
2,No Math!,"If you plan on passing the math section of the TEA, and want to use this study guide as a gage...don't! The math from this book did, in no way prepare you for the test. The other two sections were adequate."
2,Gives you a start,"This book is to simple for the real TEA exam. If you are going to get a book to study get the ARCO Special Agent book. The questions in the ARCO book are more complex and do a better job of preparing you for the test. I just got done taking the test, and if I hadn't had the ARCO book I most probably would have failed the test. I gave it 2 stars because it does give you an idea and a start, but please don't waste your time with this book."
1,too simple,"this book is too simple, nothing like what the actual exam will be like, especially the Math section."
1,A complete waste of time!,The actual exam was much harder than any of the practice tests. I aced every practice test in this book and most likely failed the actual exam. Spend your money elsewhere.
2,It gives an idea,"This study guide gives an idea of the type of questions that are on the TEA exam, but it does not give an accurate picture of the difficulty of the questions on the exam. This study guide makes you think that you are ready for the exam when you are not. I recommend getting ARCO's Special Agent Deputy U.S. Marshall study guide."
3,YOU MUST READ THIS!!!!!!,"I just took the test today and I wanted to write this while it was fresh in my mind. I think this is the PERFECT book to START with for people that have well over one month to prepare and are shaky in math and reading comprehension... It gives many SIMPLE problems and explains them well. I literally forgot how to complete simple math problems because I have not done them in 10 years and this book really helped me remember that stuff. But, be careful...many of the problems are TO EASY and are not close to the real exam questions. So, if you are in the same situation and have a lot of time to prepare, I would buy this book as a start and then move to the ARCO Deputy Marshall book. The ARCO book is much closer to the exam but it assumes that you remember some simple math. GOOD LUCK!!"
4,Interesting Case,"This was the very first Queen's case I read. I picked Queen because I like to read Japanese crime/suspense books especially those written by Shizuko Natsuki. Her famous The Tragedy of W, The Tragedy of M and The Tragedy of C were influenced by Queen's The Tragedy of X, Y and Z.The story started with a strange looking man and later extended to an uncommon book stealing event. The reader would discover that they were linked together and after three-quarters of the book, it would be clear who was the thief and why he committed such a crime. But was it the end? No. There was an unforgettable twist in the end one would remember for a while."
4,Good tips to remember for solid hitting techniques,"Bob Campbell's video has a lot of tips and nuggets to remember when hitting slow pitch. He stresses a good clean and fluid motion. This video will be helpful for people who have hit a little bit but want to get better. I think this is especially true for people who have played baseball but not softball.The purpose of his video is really in keeping solid mechanics throughout the swing. His points are easy to remeber,easy to follow, and make complete sense. After watching his video, I could easily see holes in my own swing!"
1,Outdated - Look Elsewhere,This video was probably acceptable in the early 90s but it's very outdated for today's softball players. If you really want to learn how to hit a softball you should go to the following site and order Todd's video:http://www.swingmechanics.com
5,Ninja Cadets 1&2,"In feudal Japan, two forces--the virtuous Byakuro and the evil Kabusu--are at war. One night, a group of Kabusu ninja brutally attack the Byakuro castle. Their objective? The infant princess of Byakuro, who is said to have within her a power beyond comprehension. The child, ignorant of her past, is sent into hiding and raised as ninja. Years later a group of young Ninja Cadets, including the now-grown princess, is sent on mission to retake Byakuro castle and find a missing scroll in order to complete their training. Sakura, Pochi, Matsuri, Hayashi, Yume, and instructor Kaoru split into pairs and head into enemy territory. But little do they know that Kabusu assassins are tracking them, and they still want the princess..."
5,A definite must read..........,"Rockstar, Stud, Gigolo, is a great collection of short stories. Torrance Stephens breathes life into his characters. He allows you to loose yourself in the characters lives and you feel as if you are apart of the story. This book is a definte must read."
3,historical text,"This book was written in the late 19th century by a Christian who saw the eradication of ""Indian"" culture and the ""civilizing"" of ""Indians"" as desirable and something that would soon be accomplished. Being ""American"" meant not being ""Indian"".The book is divided into three parts: the grammar, which is outdated and phonetically inexact; the texts, which I found interesting, since they include some Dakota myths in their original language with English translation; and ethnographic texts, which reveal their author's Christian bias.I would recommend buying instead theNew Lakota Dictionary, which has an extensive section on grammar - although it is concerned with the Lakota dialect, Dakota is similar enough that the grammatical breakdown provided in this dictionary will allow you to learn Dakota as well. The principal differences are phonetic (Dakota /md/ for Lakota /bl/, for instance) and lexical.Riggs's book is of interest mainly as a historical curio."
3,Kinda-sorta,"I liked it, but I didn't think it was one of Ann. M. Martin's best books. I think it was a good idea Kristy broke up the club. They all needed a break from each-other, just like we all need breaks at some things. But it was good that they all got back together again. It would totally ruin the whole thing if they broke up for good! I like the earlier books better, though. they had more drama in them. The late books weren't really all that WOWIE. They didn't have that ZING to them like the earlier books did. Ann needed to add more charectors in her books, instead of the same ones."
3,Pretty boring,I remember reading this book and thinking that it would be really good. I found that it was pretty boring. I think by the time the author got to book 100 she would have some new ideas. Still it is a part of the series. Read #101 it is one of my favorites.
4,HMT Enterprises Toilet Seat Riser,"the risers are strong and can hold up.the only problem when using the toliet i pee on the floor because there is no front to it, so maybe come up with something that can be a front graud or something"
2,gift to daughter,My wife wanted me to get this for our daughter. Our daughter has lots of problems and my wife though that she might like to see this TV series.
3,Not wildly believable...,"...and I don't mean Earl the Angel. I can suspend my disbelief that far. But can a five foot nothing, 95 lb woman really manhandle the bad guys the way Grace does? Not in the real world she can't. I also think there is too much nudity. They could have established Grace's, shall we say, undiscriminating sex life without showing her naked in every single episode. That said, the acting is good and I really enjoy Leon Rippy as Earl."
4,Edgy but enjoyable,"Long a fan of police buddy dramas such as NYPD Blue, I looked forward to this video as being of the same genre. It is, but with the heroine as a flawed person still in pursuit of crime and injustice. She has self-destructive tendencies, but there is hope of a good outcome. I'm pleased and looking forward to the second series."
3,Starts slow,This show starts out really slow. We don't know if we'll stick it out for very long. We'll give it one or two more episodes.
3,stuck between thoughts,"caught somewhere between WireThe Wire - The Complete First Seasonand Joan of ArcadiaJoan of Arcadia - The First Season, Saving Grace seems stuck between ""adult"" actions and childish dreaming. there is a moment of genuine bravery: when Grace calls out for God's help - but even this is masked behind a whisper. starting with an act of immorality, the makers of this confusion claim it's a story about faith - hogwash! it's another greedy-beak ploy to confuse consumers. there's a moment of truth: when Earl tells Grace, ""fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, child...."" Heaven help this show!"
1,Do Not Bother,I really wanted to like this show. Love Holly Hunter - but simply cannot get into it. I'm okay with the angel but there is absolutely no writing. How the heck can that be? Stopped watching in the middle of episode 3 - could not take it anymore. Do not bother.
2,disappointed,There are four discs in this set Only two play in my Bose system. I had to watch the others in a different dvd player .It's a hassle. Dvd not a good quality but the Show is great!!I love it. Great acting. Great storylines.Can't wait for the new season.
1,You call that a freakin' preview?,"So what is it about the credits scrolling over a shot of highway stretching through the plains that is supposed to make me want to watch this show? I'm not a chronic boob-tube consumer. I never heard of this show before. I read a blurb and was curious enough to look it up. If the preview had been remotely interesting or given me a clue about the show, I'd pay to watch an episode because I'm in the mood to watch something new, but I'm not going to pay for something I know nothing about. That's just stupid.Stupidity really annoys me."
4,Great female character,Saving Grace is a wonderful show with a dynamite cast. Grace's complicated relationship with her family and her best friend make this show worth watching. Her job as a detective and her interactions with her co-workers are also extremely well done.
3,A different cop show,A somewhat risque and yet religious cop show set in Oklahoma using cities in Oklahoma for character names. Entertaining in a different way.
4,Good Show,This show has an interesting premise. It's a good detective series with a twist. The interaction between the two major characters is really interesting.
3,WHAT HAPPENED TO PRODUCTION,"THIS ALBUM WOULD HAVE BEEN FIVE STAR EASILY IF THE PRODUCTION WAS BETTER, I MEAN SOME OF THE BEATS WERE TOP NOTCH , THEY JUST DIDN'T SOUND LOUD ENOUGH OR THE BASS DIDN'T HIT HARD...WITH EXCEPTION OF THE SINGLE TRRACK PRODUCED BY NECRO THE REST OF THE ALBUM WAS KIND OF PITCHY THROUGHOUT. KIND OF DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST. MAKING L.A. LOOK BAD"
2,Too Skimpy...,"I was brought up on virtually ExamCram books for my certifications (Cisco, M$, CIW, COMPTIA, Linux, etc), and I usually have good things to say about the quality and the mapping of the material to the exam objectives.This book, however, is the exception rather than the rule. The material covered in just abut 250 pages sans the Sample Test and the Glossary is nothing to shout about. Take away the first 2 chapters which are merely basic stuff found most probably in their other books on the OSI model/Internet and so on and what you have is very skimpy material that hardly covers 30% on what the exam touches on.The 70-216 exam is probably the toughest exam of the Core, and the Sample questions are no where near the Case Studies. Take away the pages with the questions after each chapter and you will certainly feel that the material begins to look more like exam notes rather than exam meat.Look elsewhere if you wish to attain the coveted MCSE badge of honor."
1,This Book Will Confuse and Bemuse,"This book actually got me confused when I read it after taking the Microsoft Official Curriculum course. I thought I understood most everything at the end of the MOC course. Then while studying for the exam I read this Exam Cram and found myself in a worse position. Week areas of the book include IPSec, security, remote access and routing.I found the book so unsatisfactory that I read and studied the Syngress/Osborne 216 book just get my bearings again. Wish I could return the Exam Cram book to Coriolis, but wouldn't you know it -- they just went out of business."
2,Don't waste your money,I have used Cram Exam books in the past and this is by far the worst. While everything is clearly presented it lacks much of the information that you will need to pass the test. It seems that the author never read the Microsoft objects for this test clearly. I recommend that the author first takes the test and then try again.
2,close but no cigar,"Although this book was clearly written and presented in a logical order, it failed to adequately cover the material I was tested on. This subject area was not covered well by the Microsoft Training kit either. I passed on the first try but I used other resources as well."
1,"too much unnecessary information, not enough meat","I too like a few other who reviewed this book found it to be rather lacking. I read this book a total of 3 times, as well as the fact that I took classes using the official Microsoft curriculum and read the book for Module 2153 twice.I used the Exam Cram series to pass 70-210 and 70-215, but this book never even mentioned things that I saw on my test that I took today.This book is definitely not enough to pass this test.Too much irrelavent information, there is no need for in depth info on the Diffie-Helman algorithms, when Network Monitor is never mentioned. Even Microsoft never mentions Diffie-Helman by name.This test is a tough one, read and practice as much stuff as you can to prepare for it. Also, be prepared for questions about Web servers, something else never covered in this book."
4,excellent reinforcement,"I bought this book along with the video, in order to reinforce the toileting concepts detailed in the video. It works wonderfully as a companion book."
2,Potty book too long,For the age that this book targets the book is a little too lengthy my daughter gets bored halfway through it.
4,I like this...,I have started to use this in place of Borax and I like it much better. The overall cost is cheaper as the equivalent boxes of Borax to one box of Nellie's is huge. I use it as an laundry additive in conjunction with Seventh Generation Laundry Detergent.
5,Great low cost remote repeater solution,"I was looking for a solution to controlling home entertainment equipment without having to open the doors protecting them. I knew there had to be a product out there somewhere. After visiting several high-tech stores and finding expensive solutions that weren't exactly what I wanted, I searched Amazon and found this. I was looking for wired, not wireless as I only needed to migrate the IR remote signal a few feet within the home theater unit.I was able to assemble and test this kit in less than an hour, and everything worked perfectly. The case is simple and professional looking, and doesn't draw attention sitting in an open spot on our unit.My only suggestion for improvement would be to offer the ""wall wart"" type power supply as an upgrade to your Amazon purchase, else you can pick up a universal variable voltage DC supply with assorted plugs at Radio Shack for about $10.All in all I'm delighted."
3,Doesn't work with all remotes,"Can be a great product, does all it says AS LONG AS YOUR REMOTE IS COMPATIBLE!The manual trouble shooting guide says only works if your remote is modulated at 38 KHz carrier . But there is no way of knowing that I found, other than trying it out. The application I needed it for didn't work, presumably because of the carrier frequency issue.My remote in question worked with other repeaters (X-10 Pyramids) as well as working with Universal Remotes. But I needed the extended range that was touted by the literature (over 750 feet!)Unfortunately, since you can't tell if your remote works, unless you try it, and you have to build it to try it... and they won't take returns on kits once you start your work, you are stuck if your remote isn't compatible!(I have to say, it was easy to build, and worked well with other remotes)."
5,WOW,This book is GREAT!! I read it in one day I was so into the book. L Rifkin is a great author using so much incredible detail. I love how at the end of the books there is a lot of suspense (even though you know Romeo dies) and I can't wait for the next book!
4,Defense Industry Overview,"While a bit dated, this encyclopedia of European defense information is still very relevant and helpful. I would highly recommend it for any scholar, researcher, analyst or business-development specialist who is looking to build up a competency on the European defense industry. Also comes with a directory, which is very helpful for contacts."
4,A Hi Los Highlight,I been a High Lo's for many years and this is a great compilatiion of their hits. Well worth the bargin price.
3,"Read for a Course, but Surprising","I had to purchase Confessions for a theology course, so I expected to simply get through it. I was surprised how taken I was with the first eight books, which were the required sections for class. Augustine's journey toward salvation is relevant even now. And I have to credit Wills' translation for that--very well done. You get the nuance. After this semester, I might even read the rest of the book."
3,Pretty good shoe,"THis is a pretty good shoe. It did wear a little faster than probably a good named brand shoe. The black around the toe tore off a little and it was gray underneath. And the inside of the shoe where your heel is wore rather quickly. Not a bad buy though, for the price."
2,Heel Cracked,"At 6'2, 280 I was glad to find this nice looking, well-fitting shoe at JCPenny. In less than a year, the heel has noticably cracked where it bridges, though, which is why I am here trying to find a bargain on another pair. Maybe a Metro-sexual only shoe ;)"
4,Great. Churchill's letters are remarkable.,"I love WWII books, but even if you're not a huge fan, Sir Churchill manages to make you read 700+ pages of history with no effort at all. I enjoy very much the details (talks between leaders, politicians), of which existance I was unaware until now."
3,An account of how England and France let Germany start WWII,An excellent account of how WWII came to be. Churchill 's prose is very stiff and you might find yourself turning to a Thesaurus to understand some of the words he uses. His prose makes this a hard read (if you struggle with Shakespeare then you know what I mean)
4,"Well, this is Mr. Churchill","This is the account of WWII written by one of the major actors in that conflict so is natural for it to be a bit biased. Churchill's style is what you can expect from a politician with his mind set on the 19th century and a powerful England that literally ruled the waves. It is quite interesting to read this as a personal view of the events before the start of WWII. It is true that Churchill was very vocal against communism and fascism while the politicians in power in the 30's were eager to make concessions to the dictators so he earned his rigth to say ""I told you so"" and this book contains a lot of insight of a man that was proven right by the events. As a Kindle product I must say that it is a good one and this book is a very interesting reading for those interested on the history of WWII. Nevertheless I do not think that this work, worth as it is as historic material, is not Nobel Prize material."
4,Good but somewhat biased,"The Second World War, Volume 1: The Gathering Stormby Winston Churchill; as you would expect, an excellent introduction to the causes and beginnings of the war. Churchill does tend to bang his own drum a bit... and you can tell that history is definitely written by the winners. I've found that Churchill's writing tends to provoke (inspire) both positive and negative reactions. I'm still laboriously working through the appendices (one wonders if all these leaders did was sit around and dictate letters, orders and memoranda...)"
5,A unique work with a message for us in today's world,This is the first volume of Churchill's Noble Prize winning six part chronicle of World War II. The Gathering Storm depicts the rise of Hitler and the indifference of the leaders of the European democracies to the clouds of the gathering storm. Churchill incorporates contemporary documentation and his own reminiscence in this opening memoir. Churchill was a great statesman with great literary ability - a winning combination. The Gathering Storm a unique work and has a message for us in today's world.Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler
5,History at its best!,"Churchill's Second World War is an amazing work about an even more amazing time in our nation's history. This is the ""Lord of the Rings"" only real and a much longer story. Nonetheless, it is every bit as interesting and exciting (more so, I dare say). Time flies while reading as every page is riveting. I am in awe."
5,Very interesting,"This is an amazing book!I have heard references to this book through the years but never had read.In some downtime this summer I was able to read it. At times I could not put it down. It certainly gives a deeper insight into the school textbooks that are used in the public school system.I was amazed at the correspondence that Churchill had with other key players. And, that he kept a copy! This of course, is a great habit for persons of his political stature and era. For us, looking back on it 70+ years later, it helps us to gather a perspective on things.This would make a great university course text for discussion.This book is highly recommended for World War II enthusiasts and historians.A distraction throughout the book is the typos. Some times this created confusion that I had to stop and cipher out what was meant. I attribute this to the book probably being OCR'd to put it in a e-book state."
5,The very best,"I am a veteran of the WWII and was stationed for awhile in England. I admired the abilities of withstanding the blitz and the thoughts of invasion by Hitler. Now that I lived through the worst of it in 1943 and 1944 on their island, I now better understand why the English people are more like Churchill. An undaunted spirit, and the book shows the determination with which he pursued the war. There is no better book from which to learn the trials and tribulations the British went through. A valuable history lesson."
5,Amazing man,"Churchill was an amazing man. Not only did he serve his government in the highest capacity, he was an accomplished author and painter. This book is well laid out and well written.Anyone who likes history will like this book. There are many lessons we could learn in our own time.My only regrtet is that I only bought the first two volumnes when they were on sale for $1.99"
4,Well written and very funny. Lots of cynical humor.,"This book is hilarious. The sarcasm coming from Doc from the very first page is just my style of dry cynical humor. The story is pretty straight forward: girl places profile on dating site, goes on to describe some hilarious dates, then meets the perfect partner. Then we get to hear about some of their life together, etc. All throughout, you get the incredibly humorous and pleasant story telling. There is no deep plot, no mystery or thriller; just a story about doc's life and the growing relationship with 'what's her name'.character development was great.writing/editing was near perfect.hot and steamy: average.overall this book is perfect for some laughs and entertainment, and the author's writing style/story-telling make it easy to enjoy."
3,Funny,"This is a romance and a comedy. Some of the dates Doc finds herself on will have the reader howling with laughter. There's nothing complicated about the story or that requires any deep thinking. It's just to be enjoyed.If someone is looking for a book with which to have a good time, A Poem For What's Her Name is that book."
1,Yawn,"This video was given to me as a gift. I appreciated the thought, but the video is really awful. Don Brewer's performance sinks way below mediocrity. The only thing this video is good for is a treatment for insomnia. There are a lot of great percussionists out there. Unfortunately, Don Brewer isn't one of them."
4,notes on learning & life skills,"Rebeccasreads recommends MUSICAL NOTES ON MATH as a timeless teaching tool, taking you & your student through years of lessons, & well worth the money.Dr. Madeline Frank's other book THE SECRET OF TEACHING SCIENCE AND MATH THROUGH MUSIC, will also help you teach your child to excel in science & math, promote higher scholastic aptitude, discipline, cooperation, motivation, concentration & self-esteem through learning music, playing an instrument & teamwork."
2,Not much more than what the Bible offers.,"I don't know what I expected from this video, but it doesn't offer much more than the Bible narrative of the apostles. People explaining just what the four gospels explain. It's a discussion of what the Bible says, but you can read the gospels and learn the same thing.It shows paintings while the narrators do their explaining. There are no live actors. I don't know who the producers were aiming at when they produced it, but I was more than a little disappointed.And quite honestly, I became bored.SD"
4,The Complete Story,This is an absolute for anyone that wants to know the whole story. I sent a copy to Jamaica...they were very excited to get this information. This is just great knowledge to have.
1,not what I thought,"Although this was a good story , I felt that it was drawn out and didn't really focus on entertainment . but I had it in my mail box 2 days after I ordered it"
5,Gymnastics,"I have been a gymnast forever, and I love this scarf. The picture looks like its a dull color but its not! It's brightly colored! It's warm and thick and looks home made, I wear it to all my gymnastics meets or when I coach my girls. I love it!"
3,Too Rushed,"I love Christine Feehan's ""Dark"" series but this one seemed like it was rushed into print. Gregori and Savannah deserved more thought. Still, I do recommend the book because it is a series and you want to keep up on all the characters. Don't get me wrong I liked it but I wanted to love it."
5,Dark Magic,The story is Strong. It keeps you wanting to read the book in one setting.The story is about Gregori.. and Savannah ..It had all the elments of Humor and Love and Sadness and horror... All of Christine Feehan Books are great..I can hardly wait for the next one to come out...This is my first review for any book...I felt to strongly about Dark Magic.. I wanted to share my throughts....Anna
5,good,they are really good they can be re-read and re-read but in order of how they are written otherwise you are lost
5,Christine Feehan,I have read all or almost all of the Dark series and I have found them all to be great books. I was turned onto them by my niece and since then I have read all I can get my hands on at least three times apiece. The books are written so the reader is brought into the book and actually wonders about the people they meet everyday. Could there really be such a race as the Carpathian people?? It makes you wonder all the time.
4,One of the better novels in this series,"I really liked this book. Gregori was one of the best heroes in Feehan's Dark series, and his relationship with Samantha was explosive. Like some of the other reviewers said, Feehan tends to be very repetitive in her novels, which can get annoying after a while. And the conflict is always the same as well, with the evil vampires as the antagonists. It would be better if there was more variety in her books, but I still really enjoyed this fun and sexy read."
2,Disappointing,"I know everyone else seemed to love this book, but I'm clueless as to why. How can a hero be a real hero if he RAPES his heroine? And that's exactly what took place--he had sex with her against her will. I'd always hoped that 1000 years of living would make Gregori a little more understanding, a little wiser, than some of the other Carpathians. It only seemed to make him more stubborn, close-minded and dominating. If you like to read romance about a relationship you don't have a choice in, about living with a man who treats his woman like a child, along with the usual amount of blood, this will work for you. I've read the whole series now. The only hero I thought was great was Adian from Dark Gold. That book gave me hope for this one. But this was so disappointing, so much of Gregori telling Savannah what to do and how to do it, I could only think she was a co-dependent sap for falling in love with him."
1,Save your money for other books,"Unfortunately i purchased all of Chrisgine Feehan's books that were available from Amazon. The first was boring, sappy drivel, that was so unoriginal it did not catch, much less, hold my attention. The best i can say is that this is the worst Vampire series i've ever read. None of the other books is any better than the first one - in fact if you substitute the cover page of one for the next you won't really see any difference. Same cliche's page after page.Save your money and buy a book from Laurell K. Hamilton, or Charlaine Harris if you want a great read, and don't waste your time on Ms. Feehan's limp ""heroines"", and chest-beating ""heros"""
2,Truly Disappointing!,"I'm a big fan of Christine Feehan's work. I have enjoyed her previous three novels, but I am very disappointed with her latest effort. Dark Magic is nothing but a reiteration of her first three books. It contains the same elements of a dark, brooding, overprotective male and a bratty, weak, and stubborn female. The only thing that separates this novel from the first is the geographic location. The same plot still abides with Gregori finding his lifemate and binding her to him for all time while trying to protect both her and himself from Carpathians turned vampires who want his lifemate for themselves. Christine Feehan's first novel Dark Prince was a one of a kind and even the second presented us with another side of the Carpathian culture, but I have found her latest two novels to be tired and played out. Christine Feehan please write us something a little more original."
4,Gregori's story delivers,"On the whole, DARK MAGIC delivers on its promise to tell Gregori's story and give him a worthy lifemate in Savannah, the daughter of DARK PRINCE's Mikhail and Raven. Feehan's Carpathians are an interesting twist to the vampire legend and over the course of the first four books in the Dark Saga, her world-building has been excellent. She writes taut action sequences and does a lovely job with description. But her uneven pacing and overuse of certain phrases -- in DARK MAGIC it's ""molten mercury"" when describing Gregori's eyes -- really bog down each book and keep them from being 5-star reads. As in the previous books, the couple's challenge is to bond while hunting vampires and/or human members of the secret society of vampire killers. Some variation on this theme in future Dark Saga releases needs to happen to keep the series fresh."
1,"A friend recommended it to me, but","The book was recommended by I friend whose taste in books generally is similar to my own. However, this time we really disagree. She liked the book and has bought several in the series. ""If you like vampire series, you got to read these!"" Since she had recommended the Laurell K Hamilton series, and I really liked them, I gave it a try.The only thing this book did was annoy me. I mean, really! How many times can an author use the word ""Carpathian""in one paragraph?? She was going for the record. In the beginning of the book, she seems to use it at least once in every sentence, sometimes twice!Besides the overuse of ""Carpathian"", the heroine was vapid, the male was insecure and overly controlling, and the plot was trite. I made myself read the WHOLE thing, hoping it would get better. It didn't."
5,love triumphs,"a have been waiting for a book exclusively on Gregori The Dark One and frankly ms. feehan didnt disappoint,for one you can expect him to be the ultra alpha-male,coz that what he is supposed to be,the way he should be and as always women in this case savannah, under his thrall should be eclipsed by his character"
4,Dark Magic,"Dark Magic is one of those novels that offers so much depth to characters that have been introduced in earlier books in the series. Gregori, the hunter that many fear and are uncomfortable around, has finally found the one person that makes him complete. Savannah is the young Carpathian that not only completes Gregori's life, but discovers that he is able to complete her in a way that no one else has been able to do. Savannah understands and accepts the hunter that Gregori is, but she also sees something more. Gregori, in his love for Savannah, gave her the freedom that she sought, knowing that he would be putting himself at risk of turning."
5,Enter the World of the Dark Predators,"This book is in a series by Christine Feehan that I truly love. I always wanted to read Gregori story, I was curious of how Christine would handle Gregori's character as he goes through love. The story did not meet my expectations, they made savannah willful and so afraid and not a budding woman willing to attempt new things, so unlike her profession which showed strenght of character and a level of fearlessness. Gregori was desperate and autocratic as usually, and showed very little sensitivity or willingness to give in to the fires of love.The book was not one of my best read, but it had its moments. i was disappointed with his story. i would have thought that the daughter of the prince and his right hand man, seeing the great love of the parents and friend would be more intriguing and spellbinding with a better plot."
2,Disappointed.,"I am a huge Christine Feehan fan and this book was not bad! I looked forward to Gregori's story and I must say I was a little disappointed. I am going to try and read it a second time but I find his story to be pretty boring. However, once again I loved hearing about them in all the other books! I wish their story was more personal!"
2,Mundane,"The entire first half of this book is two ""life mates"" touching each other's minds a.k.a mind reading. Savannah thinks Gregori is a monster. Gregori thinks himself a monster. Savannah suddenly realizes he isn't a monster, but Gregori still thinks the former, and round and round we go where it stops nobody knows. This goes back and forth ad nauseam with a little sex and violence thrown in here and there. I can't believe I paid money for this book."
5,Dark Magic,"An intriguing mix of adventure, sexuality and compassion. What could be better? Couldn't put it down. This series is wonderful."
2,DISAPPOINTING....,"I had a strong aversion to Gregori ALWAYS KNOWING what was best for Savannah, as if she had NEVER made a decision for herself. I adore strong men BUT, Geez Louise.... I did enjoy Gary's role in the book but his introduction came late into the book when I was already skipping pages and trying to find something inspiring to grasp on to. The ending was predictable and disappointing."
4,Whats the point of buying a kindle.,what was the point of buying a kindle if i can just go to the store and get the book for the exact same price? i mean come on its wirelessly delivered and you dont even have to waste paper on printing the book. i would just think the publisher would be a little more fair on the price.
3,typical feehan,"I have read almost all of the dark series and must say that I like them. I have a tendency to skip over some of the love scenes at times, but I like the total story line and the idea of one eternal love/lifemate/soulmate. That there are no others but them. This is a typical Feehan Dark Series read. You could change the cover page and get the same principal story, but then you wouldn't get to know each Carpathian."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad","I don't think the book sucked by any means, but it just didn't have that certain...somethin somethin. And I really can't tell you what exactly is missing. The sex was hot, the chacters...good. Maybe it was just the story in general. If you were to purchase this book, buy it used. Oh and if you want something that will make your toes curl and blow your socks off. Then check out Kresley Cole's Immortals After Dark Series. Good stuff baby!"
1,Degrading and vicious,"This book is one rape scene after another. Gregory rapes her body, her mind, her dignity, until she is nothing but an agreeable puppet. There is even a scene where he takes over her body and forces her to move like a puppet. He only respects ""no"" when it comes out of his mouth.The ""hero"" is completely uninterested in knowing this woman as a person. His laments about giving in to her are laughable and insulting. His only consessions to her desires are much like little rewards for a well-behaved child.I kept hoping Savanna's real lifemate would show up and kill Gregory."
1,No Magic Here!,"Since I've read nothing but glowing recommendations for Ms. Feehan's ""Dark"" series, I decided to try this book. I was barely 100 pages into it when I was overwhelmed by Gregori. He may be dark, dangerous and sexy but he was also overbearing, arrogant and violent. He was worse than a stalker, following her to the ends of the earth, using the powers of his mind to force her to do things ""for her own good"" and his violent first encounter with her completely went against my idea of romance. I've read ""forced seductions"" but to me this was all out rape. If she could have gotten to a police station and showed them the blood and bruises, I have no doubt this ""hero"" would be serving a life sentence! Sorry, no magic for me here."
1,He raped her and almost killed her,"From that moment the book went south for me. I could not get it out of my mind that he raped her. No matter how tasty the other love scenes where, it really didn't matter to me. I loved the other books and i was looking forward to seeing Gregori with a mate. He is domineering, the whole story did not apeal to me at all. Savannah has no power at all, i would hate to be her. If you like the sick twisted abusive stories then you will probably enjoy this book."
3,OK but not great,"I enjoy romantic vampire novels, and this one was OK. I had a couple of problems with it. The hero is overwhelmingly macho. The heroine changed from extremely self sufficient to willing to accept the hero's macho attitude too suddenly for me to be comfortable with the change. At least she didn't change into a total wimp.There is some plot in addition to the love story, which is something I like. Since I've only read one book from the middle of the series, I don't know if the plot is part of an arc involving several books which changes over time or if it will simply be a plot device that affects each of the couples in pretty much the same way in each of the books.I have begun to read another of this author's books, but I can already tell that it isn't a series I will return to over and over again. It seems all the men in this series will be overwhelmingly macho. It is built into the ""universe"" the author is writing in. Oh well..."
1,Excusing rape is NOT okay and men who rape are NOT sexy!!!,"I've read three other books in this series, liked them and been able to overlook the sexism and sometimes weak females, but this is just sick. What a dissapointment, Christine. And what a bad message you send to women and teenagers when you write a book like this. I'm done with this this author!"
1,Dreadful reader!,"Once one accepts the basic formula and Feehan prose style for almost all the ""Dark"" novels, the issue becomes how well the material is read. Juanita Parker, who does both ""Magic"" and ""Gold"" is horrendous. I'm unfamiliar with the word ""accross't"", and she consistently adds a ""t"", as well as contributing so many erroneous pronunciations that one's attention is drawn to her multitudinous mistakes, and waiting for the next one to happen. Which it invariably does. I have a very large collection of cd books, and the 2 read by Ms. Parker are going straight to the Salvation Army. I have 3 other Feehans, with a different narrater on the shelf which I'm going to try once I've gotten the dreadfulness of the Parker experience solidly in the rear view mirror. As these were the first 2 ""Dark"" novels I read, the Parker experience was particularly distracting and disappointing."
5,Excellant!!!,Book was just as described and arrived very fast. I am well pleased with this seller's service. Thanks!!!
2,Anticlimatic!!,"If you are reading these in order, this one is anticlimatic! you know that they are going to be together and the back story is horrible. I really enjoyed the first 3, but the stories are becoming so much the same that I am giving up on this series! I enjoyed sherrilyn kenyon's series so much more (which is also a little repetitve), but better written. Christine really needed an editor to get rid of the same old statements over and over again AND to speed up the book"
4,Awesome,"I started off reading this series in the incorrect order. I read Natalya and Vik's story first, then Mikhail and Raven's, so I always wondered who was the mysterious Gregory. This story did not disappoint me in the least."
5,Outstanding way to gain an introspective view of CEO's.,The book gives a very interesting and innovative way of portraying the reasons for success or failure of CEO's. Written in a fable format gives the reader a sense of reading a fiction novel thus creating more interest in pursuing the rest of the book.
4,"Better than the ""How to"" books","This book was sent directly to me from the Table Group. They had seen my other reviews and wanted my opinion on Lencioni's book.As CEO of a company I can say that this book was better than most. Any CEO position comes with different responsibilites and this book isn't trying to give the reader a check list of items they should meet in order to be successful. Instead, this book gives the reader five different holes CEO often fall into. This is something that other books fail to address, it's also probably the main area most CEOs fail at.The book was a little too easy and a little too short, but I enjoyed how the temptations were laid out and the fable story line worked for me. However, I would have liked to have seen more information on how to correct these temptations once a CEO knows that he/she has problems.A little too short and little too easy, but better than most of the books out there. This is a book any CEO or any want-to-be CEO should read."
3,"Simple message, cute story","This book follows the thread of so many children's books: deliver your message by putting your main character through a series of challenges and let him (seemingly) come to his own conclusions and emerge a better person because of the experience. By using the janitor character, Lencioni was able to paint a metaphor for the individual perception of success. The message became clear that there are lessons to be learned from everyone no matter who you are. Or, in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, ""Every man I meet is in some way my superior. In that, I learn from him."" And really, the mark of a good leader is to pull from as many sources as possible and treat everyone with respect - regardless of their level. That message shone through."
3,Decent airport business book fare,"This book is a mildly interesting diversion, suitable for passing the time at the airport or elsewhere. It offers some interesting comments on CEO's failings, mainly around that they put themselves and their own egos and intersts above the company's.It is written in classic almost formulaeic management-book style: a simple story is given a title with numbers and a simple ""law"" it is also so basic that it can be applied and expanded to many situations, epsecially if you are gullible. Gives the impression that this was witten entirely for the money."
5,Made a difference for me,"The lesson here is simple. Being a CEO is simpler if you don't succumb to 5 common temptations. I have succombed to 3 of them, so maybe I needed this book. ;) Definitely needed this book. I kind of knew I was doing this all of this time, but after reading the book could no longer deny it. I guess you could say I am an example of ""when the student is ready, the teacher will appear"". If you are new to management (or struggling with it like I am) then you may find this book extremely useful - if you are honest with yourself anyway.If you are a great CEO, you may not need this. If you are struggling with people, or, like I tend to be, more focused on results then people much of the time, this may give you insights to do better."
2,I was not impressed.,"The book does deliver a message, but one that should be delivered via a short magazine article. It's amazing how someone can stretch a thought so far and create an entire book. I've read countless numbers of books that try elaborate on a list of something...in reality, all you need is the list. If you read the reviews of this book, you've read the book."
4,The five temptations of a CEO,The book is interesting and while much of the technical content i have found elswhere the presentation is current and engaging. This has been missing in other materials i have read and it is this which encourages aplication of the principles.A good book with relavent content presented in a manner that moves the reader to aplication.
4,Excellent,A very good audio book. I like the part when the author summarize all temptations backward.
2,Temptations,"This book could have been about 1/3rd its size & accomplished the same thing. It literally is a fable; the guy meets a mystical man on a train who gives him the wisdom of ancient CEOs past, then wakes up to discover ('gasp!') its all been a dream. Giant waste of time. You can read the summarizing chapter at the end and not miss a thing."
3,"Great lessons, terrible writing","The five lessons in this book are well worth noting, but getting there is extremely painful. The lessons in this book are thought-provoking and challenging. Looking at my career, I have falling into a few of these traps myself.Unfortunately, it reads as if it were written by a 7th grader. Much of this book is painfully awkward dialog. Fortunately it is short so the pain doesn't last long. Just get a running start and plow through it as fast as you can!"
2,This Sharpie is a dud...,"I found that the retractable Sharpie markers dry out very quickly. It's nice to be able to open and close the pen with just a click, but air still gets to the pen tip, rendering it useless."
5,Always love Miller films,"Even if you are not a fan of the sports that Miller covers, his movies are always very good. We have been watching his films for years."
2,Not up to par,"for a Warren Miller flick, I found it disjointed and of course there was great photography in it...but don't expect the flow or the human personality touch of his other films...felt like this film was rushed/pieced together."
4,Rice Wine,"How many of you enjoy reading a book that deals with issue a country might face. How a persons decision will decide the out come of a countries future. It is like the countries faith lies in this mans hands. If you find this interesting then the book ""Rice Wine"" will be a pleasure reading."
3,NYS RCT,NYS RCT will be eliminated in 2 years. How do you use these books? Are there any other RCT books out there?
1,Gave up,Long time fan of Stephanie Laurens but this book is awful to the point that I couldn't even get half-way through it. Maybe next time her editor won't just rush to publish because of a deadline.
3,Not as good as others in the series,"Was Ms. Laurens intending to write a Romance or a Mystery? It seems that she was not sure, and as a result, the book is not a very good example of either. You know who the murderer is even before the body appears while the hero and heroine fall in love instantly so the romance lacks tension. Further, the characters are not very interesting or well developed. The earlier books in this series are much better."
4,Different Tone then Previous Books,"Previous books by Stephanie Laurens in the Cynster series have had more of a conspiracy feel to the plot. However, Laurens starts the book by having Gerrard Debbington confess that he doesn't believe he can love deeply and completely and still have the energy to paint.This book isn't about conspiracy. It's about the truth of love. The last pages of the book are very beautiful. Love is defined by everyone differently. But this book is a wonderful expose on a deep romantic love that is beyond words and is about feelings. In this case, Gerrard Debbington paints his love."
2,A disappointing read,"I have really enjoyed this series up till now but this one was a disappointment. I finished the book but it was a tough haul. The characters were not well developed and there was little fire between the main characters. I found the premise to be oddly presented and not plausible. I certainly hope she gets her edge back in the next one. If you feel like you need to read this because it's the next Laurens, I would recommend you go to the library or wait for the paperback of this one, don't waste your money on the hardcover."
1,Truly awful!,"I've read and enjoyed Stephanie Laurens novels over the years - some more than others, but overall, all have been at least good.This one is horrible! Hero and heroine are basically an item from the first 40 pages or so, and after that it is an incredibly lame plot involving murder, intrigue and so on. Zero romantic tension (but lots of sex). Way too much detail and the plot is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read! (And I like silly romance novels, my standards are pretty low here!)Give this one a pass."
3,Lost interest,"I love Stephaine Laurens; so when this one came out I snatched it up immediately. After the first couple of chapters though my attention starting wandering. It's just, well, bland. To be frank I was disappointed. I felt like I was back in high school, and was being force fed reading material again. I wanted to scream get to the point, but instead (after forcing myself to read a total of 4 chapters) I jumped to the back of the book and read the ending.This one needs more work, and that the only reason she put it out was to make the deadline."
3,Well....,"I am torn about this book. The beginning really dragged on for me and I had to force myself to keep reading. It was not until after they went to London that I became interested. I liked the characters and the plot was somewhat different, but the descriptive text went on forever.Stephanie Laurens is an excellent writer, but I was disappointed in this story."
1,Poopie,"The Cynster's are a favorite of mine and I was really happy when I stumbled across this one at $20.. Spoiler** A painted portrait will tell people your not a killer....OH MY , Im mad I wasted $20 on this book. Ms. Laurens sucked you in with her other books which were wonderfully written..Why do authors do that, write 4 good books in a series, then put the last one in hardcover and they cost alot and stink.. Dont bother..go to the library for free if you must...I wish I had.."
2,It took a long time to read,I try not to read another book till I've finished the one I am reading. This book took over 6 months to finish. It just lacked something and didn't get me hooked.
2,Boring About Love,"This was the worst Cynster novel I have ever read. Afer the first chapter I was bored. The Cynster men and honorary Cynster men have been very sensual, etc; but this one is just ho-hum.I have loved reading Stephanie Laurens' books but the recent novels (2005, 2006) lack the spark or chemistry that makes a romance special. It seems the demand by readers has created a rush to publish new novels and the special or magical touch in the previous Cynster novels, etc(in my opinion)is missing."
2,Only Two Stars,"I usually adore the Cynster novels by Stephanie Laurens and buy them as soon as they are released. This one I really could have done without reading. What is really strange is I am not sure why. The story sounds interesting, but it really wasn't. The plot dragged on and was unrealistic. I did not like the characters and could not even finish the book. I have never read a book this bad by Stephanie Laurens before. I'm only giving it two stars because occasionally there was a few funny sentences in the sections that I did read."
3,Not the best - Not as bad as some of these reviews portray,"I agree with other reviewers that this was not the author's best work. The story does drag and lacks that ""certain something"" that captured readers' interest in past Cynster novels and some of the characters are not believable. Nevertheless, I did enjoy this book. It is not as blatently sexual as some past Cynster novels and does not ""drag in"" all the characters from past Cynster novels to solve the mystery. It is pleasant to read, if not thrilling."
2,1 of S. L.'s Worst!,"I believe this book contains some of the most ridiculous plot lines that I've ever read in any novels! A whole neighborful of people suspecting the heroine of murder just because she argued with her mother once on the morning of the mother's mysterious death? And even her own father suspecting her of it? And trying to dispell this suspicion just by making a portrait of the her & presenting it to the world? And the heroine, a noble lady, sleeping with the hero, Gerrard Debbington, without even the promise of a forth-coming marriage(as far as she knew) when the hope of making a respectable marriage for herself in the future wasn't still beyond her & doing so without even taking any precautions against a possible pregnancy? Does this make any sense to anybody? (It sure doesn't to me!)"
2,Disappointing melodramas,"I'm a big fan of foreign language films and my large collection includes Kurosawa, Ozu, Bergman, Dreyer, Malle, and many others. I purchased 3 DVDs from this Chinese Film Classics Collection and they are all terrible movies. Empress Wu Zetian chronicles the rise to power of the woman who was empress of China from 690 to 705 AD. It is slow-moving and the actress playing the empress sneers evilly throughout. A drunken monk attempts to provide comic relief, but instead is just embarrassing. Dream of the Red Chamber is based on the famous novel and is one of the most filmed stories in Chinese cinema. This is the first filmed version and I sincerely hope the later versions are more interesting than this one. It is a long (2:05) costume melodrama which is static and even more boring than Empress Wu Zetian. There is lots of weeping and whining, a couple of songs, and a final tragedy. I didn't think this movie would ever end. Don't waste your money!"
3,"It was alright, but...","This is a novel about a young, semi-alcoholic teenager, who decides to run away from home because he has difficulty getting along with his parents, family, friends and teachers. Crabbe, a straight A students, decides to leave home the night before his final exams and graduation. He runs out to the forest and there he has great difficulty surviving, until he meets Mary, a young woman who is also running away, but for much different reasons. Mary teaches Crabbe how to survive in the wild, and provides Crabbe with comfort. At the end of the novel, many interesting twists and turns happen, and the ending is something that very few would expect.Though this book could be very profound at times, it was also boring in others. I had to read this novel in grade 9 for a project, and because I had to do work on it, that could explain why I did not enjoy it as much as I could have.If this novel sounds interesting to you, take a chance and buy it, you might enjoy it more than me."
1,Cheap Gloves!,"I purchased a pair of these ""perforated"" gloves because they look slick.Unfortunately, they ripped within two weeks of more than gentle use. The Velcro closure on my right hand has already begun to separate from its stitching, & no longer provides a snug fit around my hand. I emailed the Motorcycle Market on the 22nd regarding the poor quality of the gloves & still have not gotten a response.Essentially, I paid $60.80 for gloves that ripped in a week! -_-I imagined that $60 would last me a lot longer than 2 weeks; apparently I was wrong.I just want my MONEY BACK. - UPDATE: Got my money back as of May 15th ^_^"
1,"Nice fit, okay quality, somewhat poor protection","These gloves fit very well and are comfortable. However, they look better and more durable in the pictures, which is kind of misleading. They are very thin and flimsy, and I do not trust that they'd hold up in a crash. For shorty gloves they aren't bad though if you only do slow speed in town riding. It's been 3 months and some of the stitching is sticking up, and I'm really hoping that it doesn't come apart. Honestly, I wish I had paid a bit more and gotten better full gauntlet gloves. If you just want some comfortable gloves, these are it. If you are looking for protection, then keep on looking.edit: it's been about 4 months now, 2000 miles of riding and these gloves are falling apart. the velcro stitching is coming undone. gloves look nice, but are not durable. get something else."
5,@!*#%&@ Good,when i put on these gloves traffic stopsand i dominate the road with the mighty hands of zeus#true
4,Very nice gloves! a little over priced in my opinion,"I've used this gloves for almost 3 months now and I am very satisfied with them. As prior reviews say, this gloves form to your hands very nicely after a couple uses. The only thing missing is a connector to snap to your jacket."
3,It didn't come in a box or a DVD case..........,"On the CD Case and paperwork that came with the software it said ""For Distribution With A New PC Only"" by the picture I was expecting the software to come in a factory box, but it came in 2 CD Jewel Cases in a envelope. I needed this software to use on a older custom build Windows Machine. Newer versions wouldn't work because Its running Windows 98 SE also the Tower isn't that powerful."
4,A nice product ... even though it has it's LOWS,"This product is very good. It's easy-to-use and quite powerful. It let's you do almost everything the Microsoft Office 2002-2003 let you do except for very small, unnoticeable editing changes and (Of course) the very limited ClipArt. It is also a bit stale compared to 2002-2003 versions and can't even be compared with 2007, especially when it comes to PowerPoint.So it is junk compared to the older versions, but if you can't afford anything else, this is the best to go with :) ."
4,Enjoyable comic mystery,"Revenge of the Wrought-Iron Flamingos takes place at a re-enactment of the battle of Yorktown. The conflict on the field, however, isn't where the real action is. Instead, battles between the craftsmen and the ""Anachronism Police"", legal wrangles over crafts software, and an unexpected murder make the reenactment look positively tame.Donna Andrews creates eccentric and engaging characters. Those characters are my favorite element of the Meg Langslow series. Meg's father, enthusiastically recreating 18th century medicine complete with leeches, is a hoot. So are her handsome and irresponsible brother, her elegant and surprising mother, and her boyfriend's formidable mother.The wrought-iron flamingos of the title remind me of a real-life wrangle in historic Hanover Courthouse over pink plastic lawn flamingos. I found myself wishing there was some way I could have bought those wrought iron ones for myself.If you enjoy a witty cozy mystery, this one's for you."
4,Murder with a touch of whimsy,"Donna Andrews has become one of my favorite mystery writers. Her stories are witty and her characters are very interesting people, the kind of people you'd like to meet. Yes, this is a murder mystery with the requisite blood and description of the crime, but it is a true whodunit with plenty of likely suspects and conflicting alibis. A very good read!"
2,"Amusing, but . . .","although Ms. Andrews has a flare for comedy, she obviously has never been a participant in a reenactment, otherwise she'd know that some of the things she describes would never happen. If you don't mind the errors and inconsistencies it's not a bad book."
1,Revenge of the Wrought-Iron Flamingos,How could I review a book I have never received????? I have PAID for this book - Ihave had the cost taken out of my discover account --nd yet I have never received it...evenafter contacting thecompany twice - on Feb 6and Feb 10 and here it isFeb 14 - one MONTH after I ordered it...and NO BOOK. Please take thiscompany off your books and PLEASE --PULEESE --give me my money back!!!!
1,Am I the only one?,"I loathed this book! I waited on baited breath for this book to arrive in the mail after all of the glowing reviews. Not so much. I am an educated person and an avid ghost story reader, but to me this book read as though the author was attempting to wow us with her highbrow metaphors rather than tell a good account of a haunting. The result was the ghost story was lost in a verbose nightmare! I found the author's writing style pompous, and narcisstic. My vote is for SAVE YOUR MONEY..."
3,"Okay, but nothing spectacular.","I bought this book with the hope of expanding my knowledge of shamanic practices, however I was thoroughly disappointed when I began reading. A lot of what he says in the book is very basic metaphysical and occult knowledge. There is very little about actual shamanic practices and what there is is incredibly vague. I wouldn't say this book was Wicca 101, but it was definitely Wicca 102, and seeing as I'm not even a Wiccan it was kind of a waste of 18 dollars. If you're just starting out and if you're okay with reading a poorly organized mesh of many different cultures then go ahead and get this book, but as for me, I'm looking for something a little more advanced."
4,it makes you want to learn more,The Temple of Shamanic witchcraft is one of the many very wonderful products of our soullife but as there are many more touches of the unknown we will be hungry to learn about the wonders of the universe.
4,The temple of shamic witchcraft,"I have not finished all of this book as it has certain parts of study that could take a year, and in the book it is suggested to start and finish to get all the benefits. I have read other books by this author and actually met him once at a friends house. He is very real and honest and that is reflected in his book about his journey."
1,Bland - not worth buying,"This book is bland, bland, bland. Basically it was written by someone who knows nothing about the vending business...they just did a little research on it and put together a lousy book. I own a successful vending business and thought a book from Entreprener Magazine might be handy to get some new ideas from...but it's not. There are few good ideas in this book, old or new. There are better books out there on vending - this one is a waste of time & money."
1,what kind of a jackass reviews her own book?,answer: the author of this thin tome. even worse the book reads with the authority of a high school research paper. don't waste your money. the author is a poser.
4,Good book with valuable examples,This is the second book on vending that I have read recently. I enjoyed this book due to the good examples that the author used.
3,Songs from the Sound of Music,"I was searching for a good Sound of Music CD that featured the background music to the famous songs. From the write-up, the CD looked promising. Though I wasn't expecting much from the vocals that were featured on disc 1 (who could compare to the motion picture vocals!), what I really was looking forward to was the beautifully orchestrated music that was featured in the songs. Right away I was pretty much disappointed in the quality of the music. It was too electronic sounding and was definitely not played by an orchestra. The music even leaned toward a circus type sound which was very annoying. If you want a sing-a-long karaoke CD for fun, this may be what you are looking for. But you could do better with a lower priced compilation. If you are looking for the music, like I was, you would do better looking somewhere else."
2,No words,"I am new at this and was under the impression that when the word ""Karaoke"" is on the cover, that means that words for your Karaoke machine are included. Apparently ""Accompaniment/Karaoke"" means music only. I think this is very misleading - I was disappointed that no words for the screen are included. If I just wanted the music, I wouldn't have bought something that is for Karaoke. This should be made clear in the product description."
2,not for true karaoke,I bought this for my seven year old daughter to use with her new karaoke machine. It was pretty pricey too. It doesn't have the words to go on the TV screen. I thought I was getting a karaoke music CD but this was a disappointment for the price.
5,"GREAT,GREAT, BOOK!!",Up the Organization How to Stop the Corporation From Stifling People & Strangling ProfitsAfter you read this you wonder why every big company doesn't make their management do most of what is in this book. Years ago I used many of the ideas from this book and got more production with less people because they felt wanted.
4,An old book that is still valid,I read this book as my father recommended it... the case studies are old but the information really gets you thinking a different way.
2,Dated - Not Worth the Coin,"I suppose when Townsend's original 1970 book came out his ideas would have been novel. But in 2007 they have been long superceded by more compelling in-depth works. This is not a literary masterpiece. It is a collection of random thoughts on running a company, arranged in a queer alphabetical order (sort of) for lack of any other organizational theme. I'd recommend you save the $15 I spent and buy Hamel's Leading the Revolution, Pink's Free Agent Nation, or even Peters' Re-imagine! instead."
4,hey its el vacilon,just like the show its the best it takes a genious to make movies with jokes like those luis and moon are always gonna be number one and i mean always
3,El vacilon,"I have followed the radio show ""El Vacilon"" for the last 9 years. So, I wanted the movie to put the show and it's personalities in perspective. I was dissapointed because I expected more bang from these crazy guys. I really hated that the subtitles were on all the time, whether you watched it in spanish or english."
1,The Movie :-(,"The movie is funny, but the picture, colors, and the graphics in the movie suck. They could've done a better editing job.I dont have a bootleg copy..I have an original which I purchased here."
1,El VaciLATE,"El Vacilon won't be out in time for Christmas? Nice work Agustin, you might as well just make one copy and give it to your moms. I'ma listen to Howard Stern instead!"
4,No Plot but Real Cool,"The Verse are great but the album has no plot no real plot what are they talking about see iv heard Prince Paul's ""Prince Among Thieves""or Something more trippy like Dr. Dr. Octagonecologyst but those have plots but maybe if they had a sick and twisted evolution but hey the verses are classic and dark."
3,Not good for grating potatoes,"This would be the smallest shredding disk for KitchenAid. I was looking for something to grate potatoes for latkes as the hand-held grater is too time-consuming. Somewhere else among the reviews, somebody had recommended this disk for potatoes and I ordered it. However, the disk (which is a good quality product per se) is still too rough at 2mm and doesn't produce the pulp required for latkes. It rather results in pretty thick shreds. In the end, I had to order an electric potato grater specifically designed to process potatoes for latkes and similar ethnic food."
2,A not very involving biography,"I found this book dry and yet overly sympathetic to its subject, without a historian's objectivity. Oddly, despite the author's admiration for Otto the statesman, we never learn much about Otto, the inner man. A balanced biography should have both sides of the story. I, too, noticed many of the errors cited by the other reviewer... While I appreciated some of the newer information supplied by the author, a noted historian (particularly about Emperor Karl's attempt to regain the Hungarian throne), I didn't really enjoy the book, and it didn't make my keeper shelf."
5,A unique and excellent work,"This book is a tremendously valuable and unique resource for anyone interesting in American Indian Catholicism of the Eastern Woodlands and the Pacific Northwest. And Vecsey knows his subject inside and out. He caps brief histories of the major tribes and missions with honest and candid quotes from Indian Catholics today. And he never resorts to easy stereotypes but instead shows Indian responses to Catholicism in all their real complexity--from unswervingly devout to downright hostile.You can tell Vecsey spent a lot of time putting this book together. His source material runs the gamut from published histories to diocesan archives to personal interviews.Tribes covered include the Montagnais, Hurons, Iroquois, Micmac, Abenaki, Houma, Choctaw, Ojibway, Potawatomi, and Salish, among others."
2,Not comfortable...,"I've had my eye on these shoes for a while, then I just decided to go for it. I was so sad because on my feet, it just didn't fit right around the toe area...it's strange to describe, but it almost seemed as though it 'puckered' in between the straps??? I love the look of the shoe...especially the heel....but I just couldn't deal with it."
4,Very Good,I am a big Dillon Fence fan so I wanted to check out Greg Humphrey's new band. It is quite different than Dillon Fence but very good.
4,A wealth of information,"I first saw this book being discussed on television. Then I bought a copy for a friend's birthday gift.I've now read through some of the book, and it is amazing how much information is in this book. It full of ""did you know"" information.It's not a book you'd read cover-to-cover, but instead you might pick through it, sharing information and laughs as you go."
5,Kindle edition is better than my print edition,Great photos and an easy read. This is a fascinating study of animal homosexuality. The radical religious won't like it.
5,This book is necessary!,"Finally, a research effort that illuminates the truth of biological activity."
5,"""there are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground""",Rumi would clearly identify this body of work as an act of worship. I had the privilege of seeing the book in it's developmental stage and was very impressed by the contribution it makes to behavioral biology and to the debate over the origin of sexual expression. I was also impressed by the commitment of its author to stay true to his vision of a completely documented exposition of sexual diversity in the animal world. I am even more excited to see the original conception in print in all its fascinating glory! This book will change the way you view animal (and human) sexual behavior!
5,Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Absolutely brilliant and meticulously researched. This groundbreaking work should dispel many half-baked theories about homosexuality as exclusively human and 'unnatural'. Particularly relevant in today's charged climate of anti-homosexual bashing
2,Half-baked theory,"The book's extensive documentation of homosexuality in animals may be valuable, but the book's style doesn't leave me with much confidence that its interpretations of the research are sufficiently unbiased to be relied upon.The book's discussions of why it is hard to provide an evolutionary explanation of homosexuality are mostly reasonable, but the alternative to evolution that the book proposes isn't sufficiently well thought out to qualify as a testable scientific hypothesis. Evolutionary theory has a good enough track record at explaining things that appear at first glance to be counterproductive that people shouldn't reject it without finding an alternative with a good deal of explanatory power. But exuberance is an idea which explains very little. And anyone who has made impartial observations of typical natural ecosystems should see that the extravagance and waste that the book worships are sufficiently uncommon as to be hard to reconcile with the book's characterization."
5,"Poetic Prose of ""River Thieves"" Steals the Breath Away","""River Thieves"" by Michael Crummey captures the landscape of Newfoundland with poetic brilliance. The characters are misty and intense. The plot is a wonderful mix of Newfoundland history, adventurer's biography and beach book. I can't wait for the sequel."
1,"Starts out well, then crashes","There is indeed some impressive scholarship in this book, except where the author attempts to make sense of figures he has failed to study in depth, such as Aquinas, where the errors are numerous and elementary. Behind the project, of course, is an agenda, a familiar anti-Western polemic dressed up in good historical research and extremely clumsy philosophy.I notice that the publishers quote David Burrell's review in Nova et Vetera--funny, since that review was anything but positive in its final conclusions regarding this book.Bradshaw is a bad philosopher, but he gives his audience what they want. He will be praised extravagantly."
1,Unworthy of publication,"This book is overly simplistic and filled with endless coincidences to keep it that way. Characters are reused for the purpose of hammering home the author's political viewpoint. In fact, politics are the tail wagging this dog of a story. And if I, as a Libertarian, feel that way, people of different politic affilations should be forewarned.The chapters are short. A good portion of the book is blank spaces between chapters. The characters are 2-dimensional and unsympathetic. The story lacks detail in ways that make the book feel unfinished and under-edited.This book as insightful, clever, and subtle as a two by four to the face. If you're looking for social commentary read some Ayn Rand. If you're looking for Libertarian sci-fi read Freehold. But under no circumstances read this."
1,"ANYONE CAN WRITE A NOVEL, RIGHT?","I'm not sure why so many educated men and women who have spent many years studying their field of expertise imagine that they can sit down at a keyboard and tap out a great novel without ever even bothering to learn what a novel is. But they do.And so we are treated to cardboard cutout characters being manhandled about while mouthing technical jargon and giving speeches better suited to the textbooks with which these authors are so familiar.Ah, but so what? In a world where Danielle Steele's fiction is king, maybe they are qualified to write a novel."
1,Not worth the time or money,"I have read several books worthy of the title science finction thriller, but I am afraid this is not one of them. The plot is incredibly simplistic and the writing very uninspired. The charachters lack real depth and the writing reads like a computer tech manual. Although the concept is quite interesting, I wish the book was written by a more talented writer."
3,Tough to feed,"I have to admit, there is a lot of power to this scanner and its software and many options to choose from. But I have only had 3 out of 10 scans that were successful. The machine doesn't grab regular office paper well, and there is a plastic flap on the back that you lift up or down depending on the weight of what you are scanning, but it comes falls off when you try to adjust it, and for me it has yet to feed regular copy paper through the light weight paper setting. It is sleek and small, but the 2 large cords take away from the space saver point of view. Thanks"
4,Black line problem is easily solved,"The biggest problem, mentioned by another reviewer, is that sometimes a vertical black line will appear in scans and persist even with cleaning and recalibration. The problem is that ink or debris transfers from the page passing through the scanner and blocks one or more photosensors, which then causes a black line to appear. If the cleaning sheet doesn't solve the problem, it's probably ink transfer, and the following solution has worked for me. Gently moisten a cleaning sheet with absolute alcohol or isopropyl alcohol and feed it through the scanner several times. Allow the alcohol to evaporate completely, or feed a dry cleaning sheet through. Repeat if necessary. So far this has solved all my black line problems. I' grateful, because the scanner has greatly simplified my record and paper management."
5,Loved the tiny scanner,This scanner is a hit with my staff. It is one page at a time but quick and clear. Good with a Laptop and can substitute for a desktop for small jobs.
3,Strobe Scanner,"Visioneer has always been a difficult vendor to deal with. They package their scanner with software from another difficult vendor (Scansoft by PaperPort).If there was an alternative product I would try it. I continue to buy Visioneer products because it seems that they provide the only small footprint, sheetfeed scanner.The one I purchased about a month ago developed a problem yesterday and I expect to have to return it.But, I am a slow learner. This unit is the fourth or fifth purchased since their line of small footprint sheet feed scanners was introduced at least a decade ago. When it works it is very handy and fast."
2,Redding.review,"The installation is too difficult. It took several attempts, even with an experienced technician. When feeding paper into the machine it fails to pull the paper through resulting in a black page often. When it does pull the paper through properly it works great."
4,Informative and Insightful,"This book based on interviews with 30 administrators is helpful to understand the present state of Catholic universities and colleges in the United States. The authors also offer many good suggestions with regard to improving Catholic identity and culture at these institutions. As someone who has taught for 29 years at a Canadian Catholic university college I found this book very interesting even though our model of a Catholic College affiliated with a larger secular institute is somewhat different than the models treated in the book. I recommend this book for administrators, board members, faculty, residence directors, campus ministers, and so forth at not only Catholic but also other Christian colleges and universities."
4,a star in your own book,The Mullet is the crowning accomplishment of white trash icons everywhere. They wear their coifs with feigned ignorance and blissful indifference to the profound impact they make.Long live the fashion trendsetters and indomitable champions of bad taste. Your trucks...your bumper stickers...your hair...your charm!Variety is truly the spice of life!
1,possibly the worst book on computer programming I ever read,"Mr Holub doesn't stop a second before starting to attack everything in Java.He doesn't like the class and method naming conventions and therefore completely ignores them throughout the book.He doesn't agree with the way Sun decided Threads should work in Java so he sets out to rewrite the entire system from scratch (or at least wrap it in something he does like).He seems to hate Microsoft with a vengeance and as a result doesn't stop telling how at every point they did wrong implementing multithreading in Windows.In fact, once you get past those things there's precious little left."
2,You can't use the code unless you advertise the book,"Don't get me wrong, this is a terrific book packed full of useful information and code to match. But Holub has not put the code in the public domain and if you use any code out of the book it must be accompanied by what amounts to an advertisement for the book in your program's About box. While this may be marginally acceptable for shareware developers, it kills the usefulness of the book in corporate development environments. If Holub removed this restriction I'd give the book 5 stars."
5,Don't miss this wonderful book,"If you are looking for a book with passion, heat, family bonds, love, and tons of humor, The Way U Look Tonight is the book for you. Dianne Castell writes a wonderful story about Keefe and Callie. Keefe is a soap star who heads to his home town to help out his father. Callie, a reporter, follows him there trying to get a story. They don't trust one another but fate, a ghost, and the love of a little baby bring them together. This books is packed with passion and heat. The main characters draw you in and you feel their emotions right along with them. Did I mention the humor? Ms. Castell has a smile on my face the entire book and moments of out right laughter. The secondary story involving Digger a local, and Georgette a rich woman here chasing Keefe adds another demension to this already wonderful book. Don't let this book sneak past your radar. It is the perfect follow-up to Till There Was U."
4,Fun series!! 2nd in the series: Keefe's book,"This is the fun second-in-the-series O'Fallon men trilogy. Keefe comes back to town to help his dad control the household with his touchy and uncontrollable baby sister. Only to find a soap star gossip magazine reporter is on his tail, and even auditions for babysitter at that just to get an interview.Well that is just the beginning. The elderly townsfolk are involved to and need Keefe's help directing a play.You should really dig into this series. It is really fun. And you can find out how Keefe juggles it all on his time off from his soap sitcom."
2,"Great book, poor manufacturing","This was my favorite book as a child and I wanted to share it with my 10-month-old son. It's a great story for kids and every illustration is unique with many different and interesting aspects. The overall material quality, however; is poor. I don't remember that my childhood book was as poorly-made as this one. The trademark gold foil spine is very thin and was peeling off when it arrived. The almost transparently thin pages protrude outside the cheap cardboard covers and the print on some pages is so offset that it almost looks as if the image was meant to be seen through 3D glasses. It's disappointing that an American treasure like Little Golden Books has become a victim of such low-grade manufacturing."
3,I don't see what everybody else sees,"I suppose this book is a classic, but neither I nor my nieces are very interested in it. We've read other books about trains, and other books about being helpful, but this one falls flat. I don't know why.Like the use of repetition, though."
5,Excellent Read to your baby,"I love these golden books, i read them to my little one everyday the stories are just long enough to keep baby's attention. Great time to read to baby mom dad and grandparents"
5,Caboose Classic,My 3 year olds favorite book for a year and counting....At this point I change words to silly it up and he will correct me. Super cute. Great book for kids that love trains.
5,Terrific medical thriller,"Howard Simon does a great job, giving us a taut medical thriller with a new kind of bad guy...some may find that aspect controversial, but it makes for a new spin and a great read. I'd highly recommend it; it goes by superfast--I was up all night finishing it. You can tell that he has first hand knowledge of the world of medicine; it shows in his believable writing. Terrific book."
3,"Book ""Forbidden Research""","The book itself is interesting. But I feel I was duped by Amazon. I purchased a ""new"" book only to discover when it arrived it was yellowed and had a 25 cent sticker on the spine. I paid almost $10 for an edition that obviously was not new."
5,Great movie! Great kid's movie and the Criterion DVD still stands up high!,"My uncle first introduced this movie to me a long time ago! Afterwards I thought it was weird for a couple of reasons. The first was that it was directed by Terry Gilliam of Monty Python and the other was the kooky plot and characters. But they were reasons to make me watch the movie. I fell in love with it after a couple of viewings. I have to praise Terry Gilliam for directing Heath Ledger in his last role after The Dark Knight. The Criterion DVD is still good by the way. Despite the non-anamorphic transfer, this is still a good DVD. Criterion does a fantastic job with their titles and this one is no disappointment. Hey, the movie was released in 1981 and you gotta give it that. I did want to get the Special Edition from Anchor Bay, but the Criterion version spotted my eyes first and the rest is history. I have the Criterion DVD of Time Bandits! And the day after tomorrow...... THE WORLD!!! AHAHAHA!!!"
5,"Uncanny brilliance, kickin' it midget style","This film has stayed with me ever since I saw it at a young and tender age. From the very beginning I was entranced when the time-traveling-divine-map-stealing-arguing-thieving midgets arrived, because as we all know, any movie with midgets is automatically funny and entertaining. Then a bunch of other stuff happens but I don't remember it, all I remember is the midgets. Unfortunately due to this I had an experimental stage during college which involved a heartbreaking string of midget lovers and unspeakable sexual acts. But that is besides the point and I am over that now phase now anyway. This is a good movie. It has midgets."
5,Brain candy for the mentally deranged!,"This movie is the perfect blend of fantasy, comedy and action. The comedic timing is excellent, the dialogue is witty and the slapstick is inspired, reminding one of the BEST Saturday morning cartoons. The Robin Hood scene alone gives you your money's worth. All in all, a good movie both kids and (demented) adults can enjoy.P.S. My favorite dwarf is Fidget."
4,great kid adventure movie,"This was a nice alternative fantasy, kid adventure movie with some historical figures. Not the best, but good an otherwise rainy day."
1,Avoid this Bluray release!,For some reason this bluray is 1080i at 30fps with lots of interlacing problems and overall fuzzy image. There is a 1080p bluray out in Region B right now that is far superior transfer so refuse to buy this one until they release the proper transfer in the US!
2,Lousy Blu-Ray. Best yer gonna get for now.,"I love this movie. The standard DVD is a very poor transfer and this is just slightly better. A step up but overall, a disappointment. Dirty print, uneven colors and no extras. Some day someone will do right by this wonderful movie."
3,Odd British humor,"This film is an acquired taste. It's kid of like the Goonies on drugs. A kid goes through different time periods with a bunch of midgets. They meet Napoleon, who is obsessed with puppets. Ultimately, they end up fighting the Devil, who incidentally is a fan of computer technology. This is definitely not a film for kids and I'd really only recommend it if you like Monty Python humor."
4,"Lots of fun, sometimes funny, and a great film",I was a high school student when this was new and the hype machine was out in full force. I'm glad I didn't watch it then. I watched it now. I enjoyed it a lot. The other reviewers can tell you why.
1,B Movie,"This felt like a B movie. A lot of unnecessary violence for what looked like a kid's movie. Poor acting, poor story, terrible ending. Do not recommend!"
3,Not what i remember from TV. Just ok in my book.,"I caught bits and pieces of this on TV and remember something from childhood about it, so when I got a copy of this cheap, i thought what the heck. Sean Connery and John Clese have rolls in this. Unforunately, I grew up. It isn't as cool anymore to me, in fact its a little silly and over the top. Very simple. Good for its time, and decent effects for 1981. Worth watching once. Reminds me of an early version of the Labarynth or Willow movies, even The Never-ending story, just not as good as the those movies."
1,Awful,"I have watched many movies over the past 45 years and this is easily the worst. I've never been so bored. If there was a plot, I couldn't find it."
1,Terrible nothing more to say,If this movie didnt have a classic place in your heart from your younger years (I never saw it before) Im 24 and unless i missed something this movie could not be enjoyable for any aged person its not funny it didnt incite any excitement out of me for that matter it didnt really arouse any response except for dissapointment there wasnt a single good thing about this movie spare yourself the waisted time and find something else and if you did watch it when you were younger and havent seen it since then maybe you should leave it in the past and not ruin a good memory of it.
1,dissapointing for a man such as gilliam,"time bandits is a fantasy kid movie.a couple of god's servants still a map with black holes allowing them to shift from diffret era's in time, and loot. accidently they pick up a kid on their way.all of servants including the kid are terrible actors.the movie is quite boring, and does nothing espically interesting, except from little bits here and there.its a pity that a man such as gilliam, who has done brilliant and amazing films such as ""brazil"", ""12 monkeys"", and of course helped greatly with the pythons, will deliver such a film."
1,Ugh.,"I watched this movie in my movie appreciation class and it was really boring and excruciating. I HATED it, it was dumb, very hard to understand, and had HORRIBLE acting. I want the time bandits to go to 100000 years ago and just stay there forever. XP that'd be nice"
1,Very Stupid Movie,"This movie must be over-hyped by someone connected with the movie itself. It is incredibly dumb. The Stars promoted John Cleese, etc.) have very small roles in the movie. John Cleese in only in the movie for a very very few minutes, and is not funny at all. The main characters are the Little People (Midgets). Its a total waste of time, very stupid, and certainly a waste of money. Buy ANY OTHER MOVIE on Amazon.....it will be at least 10 times better than this VERY STUPID MOVIE."
1,An Insane Movie,This is a lousy movie. Thankgoodness for modern technology and better stories in todays world. The age of this film is all that keeps this movie from ultimate destruction. Someone please tell me why anyone would steal and run from a God?! That is pretty sad. No one could possibly believe that they could actually succeed in such a hopeless adventure. And why would god test ultimate evil? This movie is terrible. This movie just dosen't work.P.S. This movie only deserves 1/2 a star if not less. Unfortunately this rate a DVD thing won't give me the options I WANT.
1,Disappointing,"A friend of mine recommended this movie to me. He said it was ""pretty good."" I thought it was ""awful"". I'm a big fan of the Monty Python series. I hold the ""Holy Grail"" in very high regard. The plot of this movie is random and diffcult to follow and the jokes are low and not funny. I'm sorry to say this but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
1,What the hell,This was a horible movie. It has no plot little action and is boring as hell. The end makes no sence and the whole movie is long and boring
2,Poor master used,"When you see film lint, dirt and other artifacts you wonder why not find a clean master print. If your generating a Blu-ray disk why not do it right?"
2,Worst Blu Ray Transfer Ever. Fun Movie!,"I have fun with all of Terry Gilliam's quirky movies from this toThe Adventures of Baron Munchausento the recentThe Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus! Sadly, horrible picture quality drags this wonderful film down.For Amazon reviews of older movies, I tend to assume that readers have a familiarity with the film already, so I'll instead focus on the question of how well the movie transfered to the Blu Ray format. The answer? Not well at all!In fact, I think this is the worst Blu Ray transfer I've ever seen. Artifacts abound, from lines across the screen, to random specks. It's pretty awful in parts! It feels like I'm watching an old film reel on an elementary school projector.You'll definitely notice that no effort appeared to be spent restoring the film for this release. I'm a bit saddened by it, too, because it distracts from the enjoyment of an otherwise interesting movie.Four star movie, one star quality, two stars total."
2,CRITERION is NOT the Paragon of Quality,"Criterion has successfully promoted itself as the place to go for quality, putting out the best films in the best transfers with the most bonus materials. All the while charging considerably more for their products.Well DON'T you believe it! They certainly cut corners on this DVD. I noticed that everything looked a little claustrophobic as I watched this DVD, so I compared it to the VHS version. The black bars in this actually COVER UP part of the picture!!! They tried to fake the widescreen, apparently. Why would they do such a thing?The recently released ""Notorious,"" also by Criterion, is a shabby print that also costs far more than the previously released version. Take my advice...stay away from Criterion products!"
4,Time Bandits,This is a Great Classic film that I have seem many times over the years and it is always a good one to go back to. Even my grandson liked it.
2,A wasteful bit of nothing,"I firsrt saw this movie in the early 80s and really liked it. Somehow in the past 15+ years it changed. :-) My wife and I bought the DVD and found the movie to be way less than wonderful. While the basis for the film is great, the details are really lacking. Save your money and buy something else."
1,An unbelievable film,"Friday night is movie night and we take great joy in finding different films to watch. When searching for kid appropriate movies, ""Time Bandit"" was highly recommended.All I have to say is you got me - good one. Maybe the worse movie I've ever seen. Felt the need to write this review to warn everyone.If you don't believe me, it's on Netflix. You'll watch the whole thing in amazement that something could be so bad and receive so much praise."
2,"Say, what?","I wish the Brits would learn that their version of the English language is VERY difficult for Americans to understand at times, especially when spoken fast. Easy solution: include written sub-titles. Is the language in this movie almost impossible to understand? Yep......... Are sub-titles available to solve this problem? Nope.......... I watched about 10 minutes of it and gave up."
2,Oh sweet Jesus this movie bit,The only reason I EVER EVER started to watch this movie was because it came with my Life of Brian DVD and because I love Terry Gilliam. From the beginning I could tell that this flic was going to hurt. It started out slow and boring and then out of nowhere midget pirates show up in this kids bedroom! After that I went numb and skimmed it over lightly. I don't even remember Micheal Palin being in it but I did like John Cleese as Robin Hood. Please if you have a soul don't watch this movie. I may be a monty python fan but I'm not blind.
1,Terry Gilliam's worst film.,Director Terry Gilliam is one of the greatest directors out there. Can't tell that by watching this bomb.
1,Time Bandits stole MY time,"This movie was a major disappointment. It was hardly funny. The cover of the DVD should not have boasted roles from John Cleese and Sean Connery seeing as they each rarely appear in the film. I found this movie to be a HUGE waste of my money and wouldn't recommend it. I've only seen it once because it was so boring the first time, I wouldn't be able to sit through another viewing."
1,Terrible,The audio quality is terrible. It is impossible to adjust the sound correctly. Normal volume is too low to hear speech. Turn the sound up and you get BLASTED with sound effects.
4,A brilliant piece of work!,This film is a real sleeper. It is a wonderful film and I use that term most deliberately. It is full of wonder and awe. Kevin is a most lucky/unlucky young lad. He embarks on the adventure of a lifetime (or three!) The film is fast-paced and keeps you guessing as to what is coming next. It pulls no punches and does not fall prey to a cop-out ending. Certainly a film worth seeing.
4,Great movie,"It's full of great parts. It makes you laugh ...at certain spots, and at others it has you on the edge of your seat. Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin did a great job on this. It's completely worth buying. You watch it, and you wanna watch it again just to see the little tidbits you missed before."
1,Not of Bue-Ray Quality,"First off this review is about the quality, or lack thereof, for this Blu-Ray Disk. I love British sciences fiction movies. I remember watching Time Bandits in the theater and loving it. However, I'm extremely disappointed with the picture quality. To me, the picture looks like someone took an old, extremely well used, VHS tape and transferred it to Blu-Ray without even bothering to clean any images. The images were grainy, fuzzy, and even contain lint, scratches and lines.Don't waste your money!"
2,BluRay transfer is bad,"Buyer beware - The transfer used for this BluRay is, apparently, not the greatest. It's a 1080I transfer and doesn't look so hot. Check out some of the reviews online such as DVD Beaver."
4,"Wonderfully imaginative film, but uninspiring transfer...","""Time Bandits"" (1981) is produced and directed by Terry Gilliam (Brazil, 12 Monkeys). The film was co-scripted by Monty Python alumnus Michael Palin who appears in the film as Vincent. John Cleese also appears in the role Robin Hood. This wonderfully imaginative film follows a boy who gets caught along with a group of dwarves on a journey of time travel.The blu-ray has not been remastered and there are many instances of dust on the image, but the black levels and colour appear to be fine. The blu-ray also lacks a lot of the special features that appear on the Anchor Bay Special Edition DVD 2 disc set, however there is an 18 minute interview with Terry Gilliam."
1,"fabulous movie, but poor VHS reproduction","One of my all-time favorite movies. But alas this particular made-on-the-cheap VHS reproduction is of extremely poor quality -- foggy picture, blurred sound, etc. A real shame."
4,Time Bandits,Movie arrived in a timely maner and in perfect Condition.I did enjoy watching it in Blue Ray but it wasn't as inpressive as Being There was. Dave
1,Pretentious junk,"Save your dough.A british kid goes on adventures with a bunch of hammy-acting little people. At the end, his parents die for no apparant reason. (Before some film school moron e-mails me with the reason, I got it. It was just dumb.)Get ""Brazil"" or ""Munchausen"" instead. Gilliam's off his game here. Or try ""12 monkeys."" That's a great film"
1,Dumb,I sat through about half an hour of this film. It was the dumbest movie I have ever seen. I couldn't sit through anymore. It felt like I was getting stupider by the minute. I can't believe that this movie would be made. I am sure there are a lot of better scripts that have been written.
3,an interesting film for older mature children.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This film was marketed as being for children. I thought that this film is too morbid for small children and recommend that children be at least 8 years old to watch it.In this film, a young boy joins a troupe of dwarves who travel through 'holes' in time with the aid of a time map stolen from a deity. They rob famous historical figures such as Napoleon and Agamemnon. Later they are captured by an evil sorceror who takes the map from them.This film has several creatures in it that I think would frighten younger children I urge parents to watch the film by themselves before showing it to their children.The Criterion Collection has special features including a theatrical trailer, a slide show of production photos and a video, and full-length audio commentary by selected cast & crew."
5,Quirky,"This movie was always a quirky little film, my husband was talking about something ""Evil"" and reminded him of this movie. He went on a hunt for it, I knew we could get it from Amazon. My grand kids have since watched it a and really like it as well."
1,Awful Transfer. Divimax? Huh?,"I can't stand to watch this DVD for more than 3 minutes into the title sequence. You can easily spot the fragmentation on the film, the titles themselves appear to be in a poorer quality with the rest of the video, and the sound quality might as well be from an old elementary school filmstrip.If they ever figure out how to transfer this movie to a complete digital remastering, it'll be worth a purchase. I wish I could return this copy without hurting peoples' feelings, it's just that bad."
3,Classic but not perfect,"Unlike many Americans, I have this love of British humor. Or would that be humour? Well, there is something to English hilarity; that dry, mature comedy that carries with it an adolescent streak Americans too often translate as juvenile in their our own format. True, Gilliam is American, but his humor is far from. In Time Bandits, one of his best works, we get to travel alongside the Supreme Being's ousted aides as they try to find a new living as time traveling thieves. Of course they fail at every turn until their greed lands them in the hands of Evil himself. David Warner is the stand out in this movie. I literally love every performance he has ever done. And Sean Connery, who knew he could give a subtle, unselfish performance. There are plot holes which nagged at me, especially the point that everyone, no matter the era, speaks English! Still, this is an adventure that can't help but to resurrect the child in you. Movies like this are a rarity in the modern age."
1,SlapSchtick,"Monty Pithon-like British humor, but not quite the level of wit, to wit. What more can I say than that."
2,"Great movie, lackluster transfer","I must agree with the viewer from Phoenix. I have several Criterion laserdiscs, including their Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and this is my first DVD from them. This does not do the film justice in any way. The transfer is riddled with artifacts from a presumably aged master, and the sound has distinctly noticeable dips, much like turning the volume knob quickly. This is painfully evident in George Harrison's song that plays over the end credits; that song is on no other CD I've seen, which is a shame because it's a very Beatles-y tune. I'm suprised Criterion let this out. My DVD of Dolemite from Image Entertainment is of comparable quality, and their production budget is generally pretty low compared to Criterion's. Is Brazil this bad?"
4,see it for fun,"I first saw this movie at 4 years old, and I must say its a weird story that takes place in a weird dreamlike place. Essentualy something a child would dream up, and it is pretty good, minus what those yahoos above think."
3,Don't read this review if you don't like spoilers,"O.K., one thing I really didn't like about this film: the ending. While some reviwers have raved about it, I found it totally confusing. After Kevin's parents unwisley ignore his advice not to touch the evil thing and are vaporized, (parents! They never listen!) the firemen just sort of smile and then drive off, like if watching people get vaporized and thier children orphaned is something they see every day, and then the boy is left standing there with no family, and then that's all, folks. Now, I think it's good to have a film that once in a while has an ending that's not nessissarily a happy one, but to have certain charecters, like in this case the firemen, act in some unbeliveable way, and then to just leave us wondering,""What happens to the kid?"" is in my book unforgivable. Was the writer smoking pot when he got to the ending? Otherwise, I found this to be an entertaining comic fantasy."
3,"I LOVE YOU TERRY, MICHAEL, and JOHN, but not my fav. movie","I am a totally devoted MP fan, and the crew and their movies are my #1 ""obsession."" However, I was rather disappointed by the lack of appearances by Michael Palin and John Cleese. From the way it was advertised, you would think that Cleese was starring in it, when his part was really no longer than a few minutes! Same with Palin. They were the best though!"
2,"Good film, but overpriced DVD","I've always enjoyed the imagination put into this film -- a child's fable twisted in a way only Gilliam could put off. It's a film I could see (and have seen) over and over again.But to expect me to pay this much for what is (merely) a charming movie is absurd, particularly after reading reviews about how this is a sub-par transfer. Not at the current asking price. The price for the non-special edition isn't much better, either (nor, unfortunately, for most of Gilliam's titles.) Gilliam's can be a genius, and ""Time Bandits"" has its moments, but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of if I'm expected to pay nealry 40 bucks for this.I'll pass on Time Bandits, or look for a less expensive copy."
1,Pointless and plotless,"Please don't waste your time with this one. Pick any, ANY Monty Python movie, sketch or cartoon and you will be getting much better entertainment. Spend two hours looking at something else!"
1,Corrupted disk - not playable on any device,This disk is corrupted. Will not play on any device. I tried on multiple players and none would play it.
1,Didn't dig it,"This must be something kids watch, but I could not get into it. Having just read extensively on Napoleon, I was immediately turned off by this cartoon character with absolutely not even a hint of historical accuracy. I know this is a fantasy film based on comedy. But they could have at least made Napoleon look like himself, which at 1796 as depicted here, he would have been a very young man with very long hair and skinny. Here, he is shown as a middle aged Englishman. Wasn't funny. I ejected after half an hour."
1,Olympus USB READER/WRITER MAUSB-10,"Sounded like agreat idea to use with my Olympus D-390 camera. Well I carefully unpacked the device, and installed the software exactly as instructed. Then I plugged in the USB cable into my computer. The instalation started. I got following notice ""Has not passed Windows logo testing"" do you still want to install it ? What heck I'll try anything once. No way would it install. Went to Olympus home page and downloaded update. Still would not accept installation. E-mailed Olympus help. Waiting for an answer. I can't evaluate the device's functioning. It didn't. If and when I do get it to function, I will evaluate the device."
1,Borderline False Advertising,"This is the second time I have received the product, very much unlike the advertised version. I have a strobe, sunpack and this will not fit it as it is about two inches short on all measurements. I talked with the supplier and he wasn't very gracious about my returning it. I may or may not order from this supplier again. Thank You"
4,Great diffuser for the money however...,"I bought this flash diffuser for my Vivitar DF-383 and it is a great way to get the best flash shots. Since using this addition, my pictures are well lit and not as harsh as they were before. The common thread that I see amongst the previous reviews is that the diffuser does not fit snuggly. Knowing this ahead of time helped me to make a decision whether to buy or not because I immediately came up with a plan. I simply cut a small strip of adhesive-backed velcro and stuck it to the top of my flash and on the inside of the diffuser. Now, I don't have to worry about the diffuser slipping off while doing a shoot! Looks neat and works like a charm!! No messy tape to deal with. I gave this a 4-star rating only because of the fit but it's worth a try regardless."
2,Doesn't Fit Properly,"The light diffuser doesn't quite fit my Canon speedlight flash unit, so I have to tape it to the flash."
2,SBM Supreme Light Diffuser,This diffuser is okay. It does its job but has a tendency to fall off the light source. I now have a Nikon SB-700 Speedlight and it brings its own diffuser. I have since had no use for this diffuser.
4,it doesn't fit perfectly,"this product size (SBM Spreme Light Difusser) Is not perfect for the flash SIGMA EF-530 DG SUPER, but it's ok"
3,Just OK,I use this on my Vivitar DF-293-CAN and I've noticed that it tends to slide off the flash a bit. So if I were walking around with it on camera at a 90 degree angle it would probably fall off. Since the only time I ever really have my flash pointed in that direction is when it's mounted to a light stand the diffuser stays in place. Still a bit annoyed that its not that secure.
1,This grilling is chilling,"Thanks to the prosecutorial zeal of producer Kenneth Starr, viewers have a rare opportunity to experience the sexual inquisition of the world's most powerful man. You'll marvel as Starr's attorneys ask the President unprecedented questions about who he ""knew"" and where, when, and how he ""knew"" her. Did Ken Starr's perjury trap catch the President? Is his goose cooked, or is he just a lame duck? When and where will the Ken Starr juggernaut stop? Don't miss this depressing look at the future of American politics! END"
1,"This is NOT a 1/16"" drill bit!","This is not a 1/16"" drill bit! This is TINY. I received two of these, and the replacement was the wrong size too. This doesn't even look like the picture in the item description! I would rate this 0 stars if I could."
2,too formula to enjoy,"Somewhat average film that wastes compelling and tragic interpersonal relationships (not enough attention was paid to this interesting angle to make it worth while) and instead focuses on cop turned P.I. on the trail of thieves who steal from drug lords. But all is not it seems as he ends up falling in love, going on the run from the bad guys (with all the prerequisite twists and betrayals) all leading to the showdown. We all know how this ends and I really didn't care one way or the other at that point. Give this one a miss."
4,Be Still and Get Going: A Jewish Meditation Practice for Real Life,Very thought-provoking! Good specifics on how to accomplish a positive meditation regimen and what results/benefits to expect. An easy read; not overly technical.
1,Amazing the author can be so ignorant in Jewish Meditation,"... to the extent he declares it non-existent and tries to inject in the buddhist practices...If you interested in genuine Jewish Meditation,check outJewish Meditation: A Practical Guideby Aryeh Kaplan,Walking In The Fireby Ariel Bar TzadokorThe Art of Amazementby Alexander Seinfeld.sites with authentic Jewish Meditation techniques:Rav Yitzchak Schwartz (Kabbalah and Chassidut)[...]Rav Yitzchak Ginsburgh (Chassidut)[...]Rav Ariel Bar Tzadok (Classic Kabbalistic meditations , not entry-level)[...]"
5,Beach Boy Classic,"The Beach Boys as a group were formed in 1961. Here are the boys just3 years later. The harmonies are right on the money, with Carl's guitar leads and Brian's Falsetto sounding great. It is a rare glimpse of a group on the verge of making musical history. Harmony as a vocal sound for the past 70 years had always been pretty straight forward. Look at the 1930's, (the Mills Brothers, The Ink Spots), the 1940's (the Andrews Sisters, Southern Gospel harmony) the 1950's The Doo-Wop Sound, but nothing like what Brian Wilson was about to unleash on the Music Scene. Pet Sounds was only 2 years away. What growth. I recommend this dvd highly."
3,Surf Nostalgia,"DVD[[ASIN:B00000ILEH The Beach Boys - The Lost Concert] is, I would think, primarily of interest to rock historians. This brief video shows the group at the top of their form in live performance. The image quality is very poor by current standards. Also, one must remember that black and white was the norm for broadcast in those days. The sound quality may be disappointing as well to modern listeners. This product was exactly as what I needed for an upcoming stage production which will include some of these early surfing songs. I can recommend it to those who are true fans of the group or the era, rock historians, or any others who know what to expect on the disk."
4,An Amazing Slice of History,"I saw the Beach Boys in 2006. Unfortunately, they are now down to only Mike Love and Bruce Johnston, with their backing lineup changing from time to time. It was a good show, but I was very anxious afterward to get this DVD and see all original members in their prime.There are certain aspects of this concert that are lacking in the modern day incarnation of the group. For one thing, Brian Wilson's lead vocal parts and beautiful harmonies on songs such as ""In My Room."" This concert was pre-Pet Sounds and thus is geared toward the early surf music as opposed to the more mature 1970's music. Also this 1964 concert featured Brian, who would cease touring with the band later on in the year.Fans will treasure this performance as a historical document of the Beach Boys' early years."
2,Too Short and Sadly Uninspired,"A smug, gum chewing Mike Love leads the band in a very short set of uninspired versions of Beach Boy songs.Their set is very short- so why the inclusion of ""Papa-Ooo-Mow-Mow"", ""Long Tall Texan"" and ""Hawaii""?Nowhere is the ""genius"" of Brian Wilson evident. Nowhere are the beautiful Beach Boy harmonies. The only thing in abundance on this video is Mike Love's hamminess.This is still a must for the hardcore fan. And it is goofy fun for people longing for the 60's.When all is said and done, there are a few good points. Brian before his breakdown, Mike Love strutting around like a proud peacock- something tells me he's putting us all on and this is all done with a wink and tongue firmly in cheek- and hearing the group without benefit of a back up band. It is impressive that they can play their own instruments and get away with it.Nice time capsule. Sadly uninspired. Too short. Needs a better song selection.I'm glad I got it, but hust barely."
4,Solid Exam Prep,"This book is a solid review of Windows 2000 Professional concepts and topics. It will be difficult to pass the test with just this book and no prior knowledge, but it definitely clarifies what you need to study. I found this book and the Server cram a great help for the 70-210 and 70-215. Be careful, the example questions are good for testing your knowledge, but are nothing like the Microsoft test questions."
5,Great book .. hits all points,"This is a great study guide for 70-210. It is much more clear, concise book than the 2000 Server book in this series. However, I wish they spent a little more time with RIS... but hey, that's why its a CRAM."
3,Not his best book,"I am a fan of Tahir Shah, but this was a bit slow and nowhere near as gripping as his other work."
4,3rd World Poverty made real,"This book is more about 3rd world poverty than the search for a lost gold mine. In that respect, I was disappointed. Otherwise, well written and engaging."
2,Not as good as original,"In this digitally remastered CD they have slaughtered every song by completely changing the music (but same lyrics) into less of a Techno and more of a classical, for example, they completely changed the sound of Der Furst Der Finsternis, and Himmel & Holler. It is not nearly as good as the original, and I would reccomend the original Das Testament."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"This CD is just that. Amazing. The chanting, the chorus. Everything. This one tells some of the Bible stories. It has good beats, good lyrics, and a good chorus. I am deffinitly going to buy another one of their CDs.For all of you who speak English and don't know German, I have translations up for this CD (and will for the others once I get them) at my website www.enomineforus.tk. The site is in all English."
4,Stop Walking On Eggshells,This is a comprehensive overview of the problem of BPD that enables a person to cope with the syndrome exibited by those close to them. A good book that gives you information to steel yourself and deal with the situation helping you retain your personal integrity in crisis.
4,The 3 books you MUST read to get a full picture of BPD,"For consumers:1) ""Lost in the mirror"" to validate the suffering of someone with BPD2) ""The Siren's Dance : My Marriage to a Borderline: A Case Study"" to validate what the partner of someone with BPD goes through.3) ""Stop Walking on Eggshells; Coping When Someone You Care about Has Borderline Personality Disorder"" as a blueprint of how loved ones can deal with the condition."
5,AN AMAZING BOOK,"I realized relatively recently that my mother's behavior fit the pattern of someone with Borderline Personality Disorder. After I did some research on the web, I came across this book and decided to check it out.As I began to read the book I felt like the authors were writing about MY life. I was immediately comforted to know that there are ways to better understand my mother and deal with her in a healthier way. No, it isn't easy. But what a relief to know that it is at least possible.If someone you love has BPD you MUST read this book."
3,Out of date philosophy but still makes basic important points that prove timeless,"Makes important points about certain steps you must take to care for yourself.However, I believe you won't be able to stop walking on eggshells through taking those steps alone....The reason I say that is because I later read books that gave steps you can take when interacting with your loved-one who has borderline personality disorder that led to peaceful resolutions. Although I did appreciate this book for the reason I stated, it was not true to its title for my particular situation. This book - in my opinion - seemed to more or less avoid the topic of specifically how to interact with your loved-one who has borderline personality disorder - when what I needed to know was exactly that."
1,If you ARE BPD please don't waste your time on this book.,"If you ARE BPD this book is not for you. It is basically a manual to help people who somehow find themselves stuck with a BPD to distance themselves. If you have BPD and you are committed to recovering, this book will not help. If, god forbid, it's the only resource you read, you will basically be convinced that the chances of recovery and living a normal life are slim and all the people around you should just run away."
2,Don't use it as your weapon,"As a BPD sufferer, I had hoped this book would assist my mate in finding ways to help us get through a difficult time. Instead this book was bought in bulk and distributed to my family with the words ""this will help you learn how to deal with her"". The betrayal ended our 20 year marriage. Be sure to use the information you find in this book for the BENEFIT of your relationship with your loved one, not to the detriment. There is a tendency in this book to blame the BPD sufferer for actions they are unaware they are making. Be forewarned.As someone who has BPD, although my psychiatrist indicates I am ""high functioning"", the best thing that I can recommend is a counselor and Dialectical Behavioral Training. I learned to cope with the rage on my own within 9 months of starting with my counselor. Best treatment ever. (I'm only on an antidepressant at this stage.)Best of luck to you. Be well. Be happy."
1,Disappointment.,"This book was disappointing to me. It does not delve into what any of the causes are for the behaviors! It also has no firm criteria or documentation to back up it's assertions. It seems to assume that everything is the fault of the person with the behaviors and it tries to explain how one should try to cope with those behaviors without becoming too involved. A person with borderline behaviors needs help and a responsible person would be trying to help their daughter, wife, etc. I found no really good answers in this book."
1,Needs more research,I believe that there needs to be more research to get the accurate satistics. I am worried that buyers of this book may be misinformed.There should be more input by specialists who treat this disorder not only the opinions of those who live with someone that has BPD. I could easily say that my ex of 15 years has BPD but even with the explanations in your book does not qualify me to make that judgement.I have now been in a relationship for almost three years which my partner has been diagnosed with BPD. Her behaviours are very much different to those of my ex. She is now in recovery by seeking treatment from a specialist who deals with BPD.Yes there are some up and down at times but not to the extent that your book is trying to imply.regardsEddy
1,One of the authors is a BPD- biased book,"The book is biased to make non BPDs feel guilty or excuse BPD behavior because one of the authors iws a BPD (Kreger- this is very well known in the non-BPD community and has been hinted on in other reviews). If you have dealt with a BPD before- you will understand why someone can find this tone manipulative. I got out of a BPD relationship- reading this book gives insights but skews things since it blames the non BPD on ""setting things off."" Typical BPD blaming."
3,Stop Walking on Eggshells,"This book did not address the specific problem in which I was interested. If I had been able to review its contents by hand, I would have recognized its irrelevance. My review does not reflect the condition of the book itself."
2,Another Label,"This is another book labeling people who have certain personality characterics. According to this book most of the population could be BPD. I was misdiagnosed with BPD, my family bought this book, I went through torture and then we found out that I had a hormone imbalance because of peri menopuase. I recommend a wonderful book called Menopause and the Mind. I caution readers when reading this book not to quickly label their loved ones and condemn them. Get 2nd and 3rd opinions before you accept this diagnosis. I know the author has good intentions."
1,not accurate,"This book has a few good points and several inaccurate styatements, for example, when someone tells you they have been sexually molested, they are to be believed. This is true. People DO NOT MAKE THIS UP. I have never known a person with borderline personality disorder who has not experienced real trauma in their life."
4,A great book about BPD,The book gives you a detailed yet summarized overview of what BPD is all about. It talks about signs of it as well as how to cope with it.
4,Extremely helpful,"This book was extremely helpful to me after a disastrous relationship with a very mentally ill person suffering from borderline personality disorder.I wish I had read this before dating him, to see the signs and hopefully run away as fast as possible, saving myself a lot of wasted time and energy. This book helped me pick up the pieces and realize I did nothing wrong. Very helpful in my healing process. Onwards to more positivity. Also good info on dealing with family members - you can't actually run away from those, they're with you forever, so the book includes some coping strategies.My one complaint is this book is geared towards helping you ""Defuse arguments and conflicts"" and dealing with the person. If you're in a relationship with someone like this, you're being abused. Run away, don't deal with defusing arguments and conflicts. Find someone better and healthier."
4,Great information,Excellent resource for dealing with someone who has Borderline Personality Disorder. Great help for understanding BPD behavior and how to deal with it.
1,Book doesn't help,"I have BPD and had my wife read this book and like Violetta stated, this book only directs the loved one to enable the insane behavior of the sufferer. I wish I could ask Violetta what book they have found that actually helps the loved one as they live with a BPD person."
2,Unscientific Abbreviations,Bp and NonBP?Everyone is different. These are generalized terms that weaken the attempt to describe a very complicated disorder.There ate characteristics like these to a lower or higher degree in everyone.The text lacked compassion as indicated by these banal abbreviations. They ate insulting to both botdeine people and those who are not.Dickens
4,"Helpful read in a confusing time, great starter book.","This book although short, is a great first read if you know someone who was recently diagnosed with BPD. There were times I thought the author was writing about my relationship with my BPD partner.It helps answers those first questions you have and also gives you some insight into the disorder itself.Gives helpful tips to non-BPD family members about setting limits, recognising that you cant ""save"" them and you are only responsible for 50%of the relationship.It can leave you with a few questions afterwards in terms of where to go now you have all this knowledge, also starts you thinking about what it is about yourself that let you tolerate some challenging behaviours.Overall great read would really recommend it to those in relationships with people with .BPD"
4,Finally understanding my kids.,A great help to understanding what I have been dealing with for years with my kids and ex. I didn't even knew anything about BPD.
4,Great book and Price,"I love it, it really helped! with my stuggle with the past, when my parents were Borderline and life was hell."
5,good information,"I bought this book because someone close to me has traits of BPD. While I may never know for sure whether that is the case, the book has some very helpful interaction and coping techniques that are worth the read."
4,Perfect!,"Great book, very informative and helpful for what I was looking for. It was recommended to me and I'm glad it was a good price."
5,Wonderful Book,This book allowed me to take my life back from my out-of-control daughter. She was having issues that caused me to feel like I had to tippy-toe around her. This book helped me understand when and how to react to some of the stuff going on around my daughter.
4,Very Insightful!,"The thing I like most about this book is how it breaks down and explains the thought process of a BP. I constantly found myself thinking, ""DAMN, that's exactly what she does!"" However, this book should come with a warning label that reads, ""WARNING: The Borderline Personality in your life may react violently when they see you purchased this book."" Anyway, it helped me to understand the illness, but my now ex-wife was so against breaking the cycle, she allowed the evil, manipulation and physical violence towards me to just get totally unbearable."
4,Worth the read,"I've never been one for self-help books or anything like that. It was more painful to attempt to read it than just deal w/ issues myself. This book is actually not difficult at all to read and understand the emotional issues surrounding people w/ BPD. The examples, for the most part, are the most extreme cases, but it's a book... they give you support sites in the back that are incredibly helpful and more of a day to day type resource than the book is. I found the book to be full of useful strategies and information that I'm working on trying to perfect. The book gives you a basis of where to start when dealing w/ someone w/ this personality disorder."
3,How to pamper the MONSTER living with you.,"I knew one. And I had to cut her out of my life twice; the second time permanently. Our ""friendship"" only lasted about two month, needless to say.People with BPD are already ""damaged goods"" who now exist to feed off you or DESTROY you altogether. You try and try to love, comfort, and provide for the creature in its human flesh to no avail at all, but if you don't please it HARD enough, it will hurt you and your kids, turn people against you, and ultimately, murder you or have you murdered in cold blood if you can't be its 24/7 slave.So honestly, I think creatures with BPD should not be allowed to mate or breed with normal humans at all. Instead, I think they should be institutionalized for life and kept safely away from the society, too.I truly apologize for saying this, but I already lost my best friend to her.:P"
3,"Useful, but dont agree with labels",Definitely an accurate and knowledgeable approach to this common array of symptoms. Personally I do not choose to label those individulas that are struggling with life. I actually choose to work with them and discover their true beings. Some of the most creative and wonderful human beings I have worked with have been diagnosed with BPD and unfortunately made worse by this label.
1,I DID NOT RECIEVE MY BOOK THAT I ORDERED AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW,I NEVER RECIEVED MY BOOK. I WOULD REALLY LIKE YOU TO SEND THE BOOK TO ME OR SEARCH TO FIND OUT WHY i DID NOT RECIEVE IT. THANK YOU
4,Stop Walking on Eggshells,"I purchased this book in order to help me understand family members, from a counselors recommendation. Initially I wasn't convinced that the descriptions matched and wasn't sure I liked the book. But the author gives great examples and testimony,additional resources, and recommendations for how to address various behaviors, which I found very helpful."
5,Recomended,I gave this as a gift to a close friend after I had a therapist friend recomend it. The friend found it very helpful in understanding his spouse's behavior.
5,eggshells,This book has opened up my eyes to a problem I have with a family member. I was finding it difficult to cope with them. The book showed many ways of handling this and my understanding of this has helped my relationship with this person. This person is a close family member and important to me and I now am a much more understanding person.
2,Disappointing,"While this publication does a good job of describing the issues associated with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), the behavior, and the disorder itself, it falls far short when it comes to addressing ""Taking Your Life Back...."" In fact, my daughter and I both read the book and both felt that it was more about how to tiptoe around the person with the disorder than it was about effective strategies for victims to implement to prevent this destructive pattern of behavior from impacting them. If you want to learn how to tiptoe around the landmines the BP person sets - which you are no doubt already doing - rather than learning how to send the clear message that setting landmines in the first place is unacceptable, then buy the book."
2,A guide on how to better walk on eggshells?,"This is a good reference and if you can get anything positive out of it, it's worth it. The one thing I kept coming back to was how it almost feels like a guide on how to more effectively walk on eggshells. Some of the other reviewers said it better. Yet if you read this and realize you aren't the person the BP says you are, and that's what you take from it, then it's worth it."
5,very enlighting,This book was recomended to me at the Generose Building of the Mayo Clinic after a loved one was diagnosed with Borderline Disorder. It helps you realize what they are going thru and to do everything to help them
3,daughter of BPD,"this is a good book for learning about BPD but I found that it made more excuses for the BPD than tips for how to deal with one. As the adult child of a BPD, I found even less. The book mostly focuses on being in a marriage or dating situation and occasionaly about being the parent of a BPD. good high ground view of the disorder though."
3,"Good for info, bad for relationships","This book is filled with wonderful explainations for what would otherwise be unexpanable behaviors in people with BPD. The problem with the book is it leaves a feeling of hoplessness for any change in the persons' behavior. This book will help the non-BPD give up his life,feelings,wants and needs if he wants to stay with the person who has BPD. After reading this book I ended a 3 year relationship with a person who suffers with BPD, it became very clear that the relationship would aways be about that person and Quit Walking on Eggshells just confirms it."
5,Stop Walking on Eggshells,"Definitely worth the read, if you have someone in your life that exhibits the traits of a borderline this book will help identify that your instincts are right on which you have probably been doubting living with a borderline.The author expands on various key components that will provide you with reassurance as most likely the borderline in your life will try to make you believe that you have the problem and need treatment.Mine was diagnosed over 10 years ago and tried to make me believe they could keep a handle on it without treatment. This book provided the strength for me to know that I need to follow my gut in setting boundaries.Extraordinarily helpful, you'll read in a day if this is truly in your life."
2,not Tony's best,"This is one of 7 Tony Little videos that we own and is the one we rarely use, unlike the others. It is very simple and rather short which might be good for those just beginning to exercise and weightlift but it is not challenging at all for those who are moderately in shape or better."
2,Not as good,Not any where as goos as his old VHS tapes. Pretty much a let down. So bad I gave it away
4,it's SUPPOSED to be sad,"the importance of this book can be found in how much it offends certain people and the way in reduces their responses to gibberish.while i don't agree with everything that dworkin says, i can sympathize with a lot of it, especially her account of what it's like to do the ""dirty work"" of the womyn's movement. these feelings are applicable to anyone who has to deal with harsh realities in the pursuit of a better world. rather than take the easy path and just ignore the horror's of patriarchy, dworkin addresses them head on in a style that refuses to sugar-coat itself. her account is harsh, which is the way it should be. she's talking about things like domestic abuse and sexual assault, and people expect her to be civil?this book made me rethink a lot of my attitudes towards gender and sexuality. whether you agree with it or not, it is an important part of feminism and deserves a reading by people who are concerned with such issues"
1,I wish I could give it zero stars,"That this book was motivated by the very best of intentions -- to improve the social situation of women -- is obvious. Where this book and its author go utterly, tragically wrong is in the expression of this desire. Dworkin vents her anger indiscriminately and unthinkingly in a vitriolic, incoherent and hateful manner. While I empathize with many of the sources of her anger, the expression of it in such a manner can only hurt the cause she cares so deeply for. It is the identification of books like this one with the women's movement that has made feminism the new 'F word'. I moun for the trees that sacrificed their lives so that this book could be published."
3,...,It's an alright book. I found it to be rather dry and clinical and couldn't connect with Carrie at all. The switching between Carrie's POV and Johnathan's was a bit confusing as well and the only parts I really liked about it was the pony training.
5,Great Erotic Story and a Great Insight to a Woman's Vulnerability,"There is no doubt that the maledom genre is on the rise. Women are the primary consumers of this niche, with men more prefering to live it than read it. But it is a grat erotic excursion for men as well, enabling men to learn more from a female perspective the internalization of the female submissive mind and thus where those delicious hot buttons are housed to lay siege to and thoroughly invade and play with all those unsaid sexual vulnerabilities women are terrified to have discovered yet secretly want disclosed and exposed, being naked and exposed for others to see."
3,Not as interesting as Carrie's Story,"I enjoyed Carrie's Story, so I jumped at Safe Word. But while it featured the same main characters, it was like a whole different story. There were points of interest, but I found myself setting it aside and reviewing other stories I had already read. I finally went back to finish it, but is was a bit of a struggle. Over all, it was ok, but if it wasn't related to another book, I wouldn't suggest it."
3,Entertaining and just a little confusing....,I certainly enjoyed Molly Weatherfield's second installment in the adventures of Carrie as she pursued her fantasies. As in the first book there isn't any prolonged graphic sexual activity descriptions. I wish Molly had spent more time on Mr. Constant as Carrie's new master he did seem interesting. The interesting relationship between Jonathan and Kate is further explored but towards the end Molly gives away the ending. When Kate gives Jonathan the money to buy Carrie's contract you can see the writing on the wall. Since that was at the end it certainly was fun getting to it.
4,Carrie's Continued Journey,"The first book Carrie's Story was good, this one is still good but different. She goes for awhile to be trained as a pony-girl, and then after her 1 year slave agreement has expired, meets back up with her first master Jonathan. In some ways it was just as good as the first but I'm not big on all the pony parts. I'd say it was well worth as a 2nd book."
4,fun,"Maybe not quite as good as Carrie's Story, but still lots of fun (and I think I read all the words in this one too)."
2,a bit dull,"A bit confusing, a bit dull, be warned that it's not as good as the first, and wouldn't stand by itself without that book. There's some more interesting modern BDSM books out there, better written, more original, including ""Blue"" and ""Many Kisses""."
4,Totally ripped my heart out.,"OK, I guess I'm a sap. Who knew? This book had me in tears at the end, and yes yes the sex parts were hot but honestly, I read it for the plot and for the main character. The same day I finished ""Carrie's Story,"" I began calling bookstores for this book because I had to find out what happened to her! Weatherfield has created a strong, intellectual, brave, adventurous, believable heroine who is so easy to fall in love with or even identify with that you forget you're reading porn. I loved all the literary references and the tributes to ""Story of O,"" which were honest and fitting through the end. I want to call Carrie up on the phone and find out what happens to her NEXT.I'm giving it 4 stars only because the structure of the book didn't entirely work. I didn't find it confusing, though I can see how others might. I didn't feel that the writer stuck to any kind of structure at all - she would start to, and then change her mind, and this bugged me."
2,Time consuming,"If you just had a baby you obviously want the best for your new one. So babyyoga is one of the things you try. And it does work. But not with this book. You will never actually get started with babyyoga as this book is too difficult to handle for a beginner. There are no pictures of the actual moves so you have to read the whole thing. And tell me, which mother has extra time on their hands to read a yogabook from cover to cover?"
5,Fun Fun Fun,Yogababy is so much fun. My daughter and I really have a great time together doing yoga. I usually do it in the evening when I am tired and need a refresher and my daughter wants to be close. This book would make a great gift for new parents- it's different and fun. Plus it is a great way to aid in bonding with your baby.
2,Disappointing,This book offered a great deal of information that was intellectually interesting. For the new Mom looking for a way to incorporate yoga into her life with a new baby it this is not the book.
3,Spottiest period for great British soul singer,"If you love the unmistakeable voice of Lulu, buy this disc. Just be prepared to skip about half of the tracks. Her version of ""The Man Who Sold the World"" is great. It was produced by Bowie himself, so you know it has his approval. ""Watch That Man"" is less interesting. The balance of this material was produced by Wes Farrell, also responsible for The Patridge Family records; so expect bubblegum. Even so, her delivery of ""Groovin'"" is stunning. The version of ""Do Right Man"" on here will make you wish her contract with Atco had lasted longer. ""Heaven & Earth & the Stars"" was a minor regional hit in the U.S. in 1976; it's a decent slush ballad. The bubblegum soul of her second Chelsea album is fairly enjoyable. I recommend this disc only for Lulu fans."
5,Surprisingly Good!,"This seemed like a silly, boring book without any real point to it--but actually, my daughter loves it! It has bright colorful pictures for her to look at, and it's not very wordy so it keeps her attention. She's 9 months old now, but for the past 4 months, this was the 1st book she'd pick up. Plus, it's a soft laminated cardboard-page book so babies can have a ball chewing on it without destroying it! Great 1st book for babies!"
1,world record for poor proof reading,"I have never read a book so littered with mistakes. To a neophyte this book must be so confusing as to be totally useless. Can you believe the author gives three different renderings of the acronym SGML within a few pages of each other. Many absolutely critical points are muffed by the most banal and obvious proof reading errors. The final straw is the tear out reference card which can't even get the rules for XML names correct. Really, it's just too, too bad."
4,good for nonprogrammers,"This is an easy to read and understand guide to desigining and writing XML documents. It doesn't cover the programming half of the problem at all, not even mentioning popular XML parsers for various programming languages. So it's not complete for learning how to build systems that use XML. As befits a ""Complete Idiot's Guide"", it has a lot of redundancy. Maybe that's so you can understand what's going on no matter where you start in the book. There are some proofreading problems (wrong fonts, missing letters and punctuation, wrong words in examples) which suggest it was rushed out the door."
5,Capricorn One DVD,I loved this movie when it was first released and have seen it many times since. It's great to have it on DVD.Story has a few holes in it and I think a bit of rework on the script could have turned this into one of the great conspiracy movies of all time. Still a great flick.
5,Old Movie but still a good one,We loved this movie many years ago when it first came out. Now that a newer version is being produced we wanted to see this again before the new one comes out. Still a good movie as far as conspiracy movies go.
3,Not bad,"This movie is OK. It stretches the bounds of plausability of course. If you subscribe to Netflix with on online viewing option, you can watch this for free. If you don't already subscribe to Netflix, sign up for a free trial and you watch it."
3,Capricorn One is a great film.,"This is a very fun and well written action film with a great cast. Telly Savalas is hilarious in the film, giving it some good comic relief."
2,LACKS PRODUCTION VALUES,"I don't know if a laser version exists; or if it does - is it any better? What seems like a good story falls by the wayside when viewed on this grainy, murky video-tape. Politics demand an aborted Mars mission go on as planned, except, it shall be done on a soundstage. Oddly ironic as one watches a fictional account of a fictional event being fictionalized on flim! Dreadfully ironic as one watches co-star Orenthal James Simpson run for his life! Probably a good copy could catch a few bucks at E-BAY though. That is, if a good copy exists!"
4,Fun thriller,"After all these years this movie still entertains. And it still makes you wonder, is it possible? The cast is perfect."
5,BIG ADVENTURE MOVIE!!!,"CAPRICORN ONE is a uniquely American film experience. Romance, conspiracy, adventure, betrayal and USG deception fill the screen with action-packed scenes and a dramatic ending. James Brolan in a custom-fitted flight suit is another good reason to see this film. OJ Simpson's role is predictable but adds to the drama and the concept of the story. I'm a military ""brat"" and my husband was a Navy pilot who wanted to be an astronaut so I could relate to every aspect of this film. CAPRICORN ONE is a classic, one of my all-time favorite action movies."
2,Amusing farce,"This is about as silly as SF gets, although it's a better than average conspiracy flick. Okay, you can no longer watch the scenes with O.J. Simpson without cringing, but that's not the movie's fault. The key plot device is, unfortunately, ludicrous (no, I won't give it away) because (1) NASA could not have possibly overlooked such an obvious giveaway and (2) every teenage geek and nerd in the country would have caught it way before the intrepid reporter finally puzzles it out. (Speaking as a former teenage nerd, trust me on this.)"
2,"Great concept, lousy acting, Great chase scenes","The concept is there, God knows enough people actually believe it, if only the acting and screen play matched the concept it would be a decent film. The two scenes that I love are when the reporter's car goes out of control and is running through the city with the camera on the hood of the car and the chase scene between the helicopters and bi-plane. Other than that, nothing special."
3,SOME HISTORY-IGNORANTS MISS THE POINT,"Some people are really missing the point about this movie and have obviously NEVER seen it if they claim the moonlandings were faked, too. Capricorn 1's dialogue loudly and clearly says THAT APOLLOS 11-TO-17 DID OCCUR.That's a fact. So are ALL my review's points. And with all due respect, I'm STUNNED that so many would then vote it unhelpful!!! Which must mean that so many conspiracy-theory hacks keep ""checking up"" on this movies' review status, as if that could reinforce their tragic, lost-cause hobby horse. I would then hope that Moon-hoaxers don't eventually graduate to something truly unsavory: like Holocaust Denial...But I digress: Capricorn One is a good film, nonetheless, despite it's unfortunate baggage."
3,"Apparently OJ was innocent, because he sure can't act","Sensational theme and dramatic concept...Three astronauts troubled by the NASA deception of a phony trip to Mars (for political reasons), realize their lives are in jeopardy when the real, unmanned launch doesn't make it back. Drags a bit because Simpson and Brolin are wooden in leading roles, but Sam Waterston, Elliot Gould, Karen Black, and the evil Hal Holbrook make up for it (nearly)."
3,Wonderful forgotten movie - Lousy transfer,"What a joy to see this movie again. I had forgotten how suspenseful it was, not having seen it since its theater release. Even O.J. Simpson can't ruin it. Of course, it pushes the limits of believability from time to time...but never far enough to make it unenjoyable.Now for the bad part....this movie definitely deserves a better DVD than this. It is widescreen, but not enhanced as it should be. But worse...the picture has areas where it almost appears as if it is being projected against a dirty screen. Other areas of the movie are blurred...amplified when viewed in a large format.I can't NOT recommend this DVD...only because it is the only one available of this film. But I sure wish someone would do the movie justice."
4,The Mission-to-Mars misfire will not be televized...,"-> BLU RAYBack in the seventies 'conspiracy' was all the rage: 3 Days of the Condor; All the President's Men; The Parallax View; Night Moves; The Domino Principle; The Conversation... to name a few. (today you'd do it in public, if you think you're 'too big to fail'...)This is a fine (and entertaining!) example of how 70s-film dramatized the self-doubt of a nation and its people's mistrust against authorities.Very solid picture. Original aspect ratio.Recommended! (BD cover data ""4:3"" = incorrect)All systems are 'go', it's the tall white thing over there, you can't miss it!Film: 7.5/10Picture quality 8/10Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 orig.Run time (24 fps): 2 03'09''Chpt.: 12Audio: Engl.ST: Engl.Region freeBonus: -Studio: itv"
4,Capricorn One,The Blu-ray version of this classic was as good as a small screen movie can be. I was very satisfied with the copy I received and am glad to recommend the service and quality to any who ask.
4,Guilty pleasure from the paranoid 1970s.....,"It is, as many critics charge, implausible, outrageous, and even self-righteous (as a post-Watergate ""expose"" it reaffirms our fears that all is artiface, but ""we"" see through it all), but I dare anyone to say that it doesn't entertain from start to finish. And how many times can we say that O.J. Simpson actually displays his acting chops?"
4,A good movie,"This is a great movie, and I would definately recommend it. This is an original idea, and a good plot, with a good ending. What I get confued about is how they were able to cover up the missing Nasa scientist, and ""erased"" his identity, including his apartment, which was then rented by a housewife who has no knowledge of the guy or what is going on. Other than that, the scenario is very realistic. The DVD has no special features, other than the trailer. But a definate must for you DVD collection."
3,Fun but don't take it too seriously!!!,"If there weren't so many plot holes and preposterous turns in this story it could have worked much better. But it's a fun summer movie and that was how it was meant to be seen when it was released.It's also really cool to watch for the famous faces involved, notably O.J. Simpson, Telly Savalas and Hal Holbrook. Plus if you're a fan of Brenda Vaccaro or Elliott Gould's, you'll be happy to see them here at their finest. If you're like me, I'm all smiles when I see Elliott Gould. And I always liked Brenda's throaty voice!!!But get ready for some great suspense and, even more surprisingly, great music!!!!"
2,Let's go and get another guidebook,"These are not my words (Bill Bryson takes the credit), and it is sad to see that the series has hardly improved in the past 10 years.Let's Go might have had some audience (it is written by students, for students) at the time when shoestring travel literature was not as developed as it is now. Today, however, the guide inaccuracy, unprofessional writing and overall feeling of amateurish outfit is hard to excuse (do not be fooled by professionally-looking cover).Travel writing is a serious business: you would not board a plane piloted by an amateur pilot ""who is keen to have a go"", why would you pay good money for something obviously not put together by professionals? You may do so out of solidarity with fellow students, but will this improve your travel experience? I very much doubt this. The students, after all, need correct addresses and opening times as much as any traveller.Try Rough Guide or Lonely Planet instead."
4,entertaining and heart-warming,"This book is reflective of life as it was in Ireland in the 1940s; is warm, touching, humorous, with a feel for the history of the times."
3,Problem on outgoing calls,"I bought this phone as soon as it came out because it had the features I wanted. I have been generally pleased with it except for one major issue: every so often I will make a call and the party on the other end hears nothing. This is particularly frustrating since I can think I'm leaving a message on the other party's voicemail but nothing is recorded because my voice doesn't come through. While AT&T's Customer Service is virtually useless, they did replace the unit. Unfortunately the new phone has exactly the same problem. After trying endlessly to talk to a technical person, I was told that they have never had this complaint before. I can't believe that I just got two phones with exactly the same defect."
4,I love it - can't beat it for the price.,"I own a home-based ecommerce business, and I am very pleased with this phone. It handles the 2 lines nicely, the answering machine functions meet my needs. We have 2 cordless phones that we use with the base unit, with headsets. Works great. With the addition of an Invotel AudioImage SX4400EZ Music-On-Hold adapter, I have music-on-hold capabilities - at a fraction of the cost. I read the previous reviews that poo-poo this phone system. Yes, it could have been better thought out in the design phase - as pointed out in the previous reviews. However, I just don't think the cons come anywhere near the pros. If I had it all to do over again, I'd still buy this phone system. That's the greatest compliment I can give it."
3,Lesson Learned,"It was one of limited few that meet all my criteria for the home office.However,NO SPEED DIAL - needed for business line.Handset earpiece very low quality.Phone itself feels too lightweight and cheap.Ignored the reviews, purchased anyway, returned it immediately.Lesson Learned."
1,Don't buy this phone!,"Don't buy this phone. It's the worst piece of garbage that I have bought on line. It has the worst sound, cord and cordless, that I have ever heard on a phone. The cordless has no range, it is constantly losing a signal. It seems to sound ok on the other end of a call."
2,Used,"I bought this phone on the fact that it was a new phone. When I opened the package it was obvious this phone had been previously used. The components were all desheveled. And the mailbox buttons had obvious wear on them from a prior owner. It seems that some point in time this phone was purchased and returned, and the box put back on the shelf without any inspection, and then re-sold to me as a new phone. This was my first bad experience with a purchase from Amazon. Although the phone is operable, I am not happy that I purchased a phone that was not new."
2,User unfriendly,"Sound quality is good & the portable unit works great but the base unit is so user unfriendly it is not worth owning. I'm going to end up putting the base in the basement, so I can still use the cordless unit, and putting my old two-line at&t back in my office."
3,Bummer: returned to buy but WON'T,"We have this system...we've had it for about 3 years. Added on to it too. The truth is it just hasn't held up very well. My husband uses the 2 line in his office. We've never used the answering machine part (so this is not commenting on that).The desk unit has long ago begun to put out miserable sound unless using the speaker. And even on the speaker phone, the sound to the ""callee"" is poor and intermittently worse than poor. Now, even on the cordless handsets folks don't hear us well (could be batteries BUT this is on the newer and older units). Do you recall the term 'planned obsolescence'? This is it incarnate. Not a worthwhile buy...NOW we have to try another entire set. I was going to buy the replacement desk unit, but overall, it's not worth the chance.What ever happened to the OLD AT&T; whose products would kick-butt the competition?!"
3,Disappointing message quality,"As other reviewers have commented, the OGM quality is awful and message playback is only slightly better. I would say a majority of messages are hard to understand if not unintelligible. The other functions of the phone are good and well thought out.The electronics and performance seem identical to my VTech 20-2381 and 20-2341 phones as well as the AT&T; 2462 (except that these operate 2.4 GHz.)"
2,"Great Speakerphone, Simple to use, Died",The remote handset died after 3 years. The speakerphone and microphone function is very good and the unit is simple to operate.This phone was great for conference calls.I was unable to find any replacement handsets.The angle of the screen is not adjustable and that can be annoying at times.
3,Broke in two weeks...,"I work form home and loved the idea of owning this phone. It had all the features I wanted. Two weeks after owning it, the handset failed. While using any of the two lines, if another call came in on either line there would be enough static to disturb my conversation. I called AT&T customer service and they suggested that I return the equipment."
2,"After three years, it's going in the garbage...long overdue","I've used this as my home office phone for the last three years. I have very basic requirements. I don't need a lot of features, I just need the phone to be reliable and have good range on the cordless handset. This has neither. According to my co-workers, my voice cuts in and out every so often and sometimes drops altogether. Very embarrassing, especially when it happened on my very first call with my new boss. I initially thought it was my phone provider, but I don't have any problems when I use the cheapo Panasonic cordless we have as our home phone. The second problem is the range of the cordless handset. I can't get it to work at a range of more than 20 feet or so, whereas the cheapo home phone works fine 150' feet away in the neighbor's yard.Just got off another conference call in which my presentation was messed up due to my voice cutting out, so I had to switch to the home phone and redo the first five minutes. Not happy. :-("
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Everything the previous reviewers have said regarding the clarity of explanation, the scientific references and brilliant summary is generally true. I have one big issue with this book. I have enjoyed reading the first 5 chapters. However, the transition from the scientific background (Biology and Physics) to the second half which attempts to show that globalization is not aligned with cell cultures and human social structures is at least not convincing if not flat wrong.(a) The transition is based on subjective data and modeled on management theory, which is NOT a Science. (b) The second half reads more like ""this is where I wanted to go with this book, anyway"" rather than logically explaining the scientific reasoning. It really does look like the author's political opinions may have gotten in the way of a clean scientific analysis."
4,Living systems,The book arrived in excellent order and provides an effective overview of a number of key elements of an evolving understanding of possibilities for a post-industrial world
1,Not like the other masque casino games.,I got the new 100 bally slots today and I was really disappointed in this one. I figured that there would be some new games on it instead of the old tired ones that we have already played. I dont care for the three reel slot games and that is what this one mostly is. From the build up of this new game I thought we were going to get some new fun to play 5 reel games but alas this was not to be the case. I really think that this will be the last bally slot game I will buy.For the money I will continue to buy PhantomEFX games instead.
5,A wonderful product,"I love this product. The disc contains many of the slot machines offered in our local casino, and the wonderful part of this product is that I'm not losing money when I don't win! I love going to the casino, but I also very much enjoy playing the games on my computer."
3,Could be better,Would like to see more of a lobby with the slot machines lined up maybe on several levels. You pick the machine which when your cursor is on the machine it will tell you what game is on that machine. Would make it more fun and more realistic. The games are ok just how to pick them could be better.
1,Never,This book is the worst book ever written you should never read it if you have a brain. This book tells you nothing but how the political views were written on pamphlets back in the day.
2,Recycled Material,"I've been a fan since Dirty Work, listen to Stern everyday, like Beer League, bought Too Fat To Fish, etc.So I am a fan, but I didn't enjoy this. I've heard about 90% of these jokes before on Letterman and Stern over and over. This DVD felt rushed. Like he just wanted to get something out quick, so he compiled his go to list of coke/whore jokes.He's such a witty guy, I'm surprised he didn't write much new material for this special.I'll be on the look out in the future for new material.Oh, and Levy on the cover struck me as bizarre.Check out It's The Whiskey Talking, Too Fat To Fish, or listen to Artie on Stern. I love him in those forms."
4,at his best,"Really enjoy this movie. Artie is great and I have watched several of his videos, listen to Stern daily. Beer League, Too Fat To Fish, Dirty Work; all great items."
1,Yikes,"I have seen Artie just a few times but have heard every joke here multiple times. Dated material, painfull to watch at times."
1,WOW same OLD STUFF,Listen to Stern and youve heard these jokes a 1000 times....very BORING.....many in the audienece with just a grin or such on their face......BAD
1,Boring.,"Artie is such a talented guy, as evidenced by his stint on the Howard Stern show, yet this DVD is a complete clunker. It feels like he's just going through the motions, jumping from flat joke to flat joke. And, frankly, if you've been listening to the Howard Stern show, you've heard most of these jokes before, which makes the DVD feel like even more of a rip-off.Although I'd love to, I can't give the DVD any more than 1 star."
1,Dont bother.,Dont bother with this dvd. I love the stern show and arte but this was a miss. i think i chuckled once or twice but thats it. i was hoping to be hystericaly laughing but this didnt do it. arte is better in the stern show. i couldnt even watch the whole dvd cuz it was just so painful. sorry art.
5,"Great song, Great single","'Hikari' is the Japanese theme song for the game 'Kingdom Hearts'.It starts out in full force then suddenly stops, just long enough to frighten you with the thought that the disc is busted.The song is incredibly tight, with inffectious hooks and spot-on vocals and instrumentation.The melody is slightly different from the English version, so for anyone who knows the English version, this will be an interesting listen.The single also contains two remixes and a karaoke track."
4,Hikaru Utada - Light,"This new song debuted as #1 in Official Oricon chart and is atm #1 in Japanese top 40, FM Chart and Space Shower tv chart. Being Finnish, I at first didn't know a word she was singing, but that maybe let me concentrate at her voice better. Anyway beautiful song, clear backgrounds and great voice make this #1 hit, listenable even by my friends who are always complaining about my music taste. Must buy, better than her previous hit traveling I would say."
5,SUGOI!!!!\(^0^)/,"Donna toki datte, zutto futari de, donna toki datte, soba ni iru kara, kimi to iu, hikari ga watashi wa mitsukeru, mayonaka ni....That was one of the verses from the song Hikari. I'm a huge mega ultra-deluxe fan of Kingdom Hearts and Japanese stuff, like anime. I love Utada Hikaru's music. She has a very unique voice like no other. As you can see from above, I have taken the liberty to learn the whole japanese version and the translation(which is different from the English version)! I also have the Kingdom Hearts sondtrack.So fundamentally, I give it 10 thumbs up!!!(mine, my friends, Hikki's, my mom's, and my dad's. You didn't really think I had that much thumbs did you?)"
3,A bit confusing but. . .,"Well, not one of Mark Twain's finest, but The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg is a good book. It deals with the temptation and corruption that occurs in everyones life. A couple receives anonymous money and is forced by reputation to do the right thing. Whether they and the town do is another situation. Eventually the whole community becomes involved and the righteous owner of the money is to be determined. Although it is a little confusing, it makes the reader think just how much money is the greed of all evil."
1,NOT AS PICTURED! DOLLAR STORE QUALITY!,"I was very disappointed when I received this product and feel that I have been taken advantage of by this seller. This item is not as pictured; arrived open in the box and is made of extremely flimsy material. The ""calendar"" was 2 sheets of notepaper inside a plastic screen holder."
4,"Easing My Pain, Killing Me Softly With This Pitch","George Colombo's third book hits paydirt. His ideas are tested and true. His presentation is clear, direct, concise, easily importable, and stems from the the street smarts of this apostle of common sense. The lay-out and design are clear and attractive. The sidebar material teases out the most relevant material for busy managers and jumps off the pages as a tutorial for busy people. I'm already looking forward to George's fourth offering. Try it... it works!"
5,Fantastic support,"I have searched for years to find a comfortable, pretty, and supportive bra. For years I was disappointed, and then a fitter suggested this style and I have never looked back!! My challenge was not just being well endowed but I am also a truck driver, so all the bouncing and jarring was painful at the end of a day!! After just one day in this bra, I threw all my others out. This bra also stands up to many washings and dryings by machine, as I am on the road and can not exactly hang them out to dry. If they ever discontinue this I will be very upset. Just an update, (10/28/11/) I'm ordering two more today, as I am stocking up my truck!! I am still wearing the original ones that I bought two years ago and they show very little adverse wear, though I have noticed a slight degradation, VERY SLIGHT, in the strap support. I've never had any bras last this long, especially with the abuse I put them through!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this style!!"
3,"""old-fashioned"" shape","I am always struggling to find non-hideous unlined bras in my size (36DD). For the price, I figured I would give this one a shot. I wore it today for the first time and it was incredibly comfortable, true to size, non-binding, etc. However, it formed my chest into what I can best describe as a 1950s silhouette. VERY pointy and separate, to be quite blunt. The photo with the black bra actually is very accurate, so I guess I can't complain. I will wear this with my best Christina Hendricks-y vintage dresses, but for everyday wear with a sweater or blouse it's...a little much."
1,"4 hooks, not 3","The generic product description says that there are only 3 rows of hooks. Once you move up to the 38DD size, there are 4. I know that an extra row doesn't sound like a lot, but it makes a huge difference regarding the width of the backstrap. I went back to a 36 b/c I just wanted the three rows of hooks. If you can stand the 4 rows, this is a great bra for women with smaller frames and larger breasts. I found a good amount of support while still having a little movement. Most bras my size are granny-approved, so it is nice to have a lacy one that looks fresh."
2,Gives an odd shape to breasts,"Perhaps this bra will work for those who are not very busty. For me 34DD, it gave me banana boobs. Good construction though, it looks like it would last a while if I actually wore it."
5,"Finally, a Good Fit!","I'd been putting off purchasing bras because it's a hassle to find a good fit. Finally, I ordered one each of three different styles just to check them out. This manufacturer/style worked very well for me! Subsequently, I ordered several more in shades of beige and black. Three washings later, I not only still like the fit, but also found them to be durable (they just look delicate). They are retaining their shape and ""newness"" very nicely."
5,Smoooooooth and pretty,"I've worn this style bra for a number of years. It's comfortable and seamless, both factors I look for in bras. When I discovered at a large department store that the style had been discontinued, I went online. What a surprise to me that Amazon.com sells lingerie! An earlier review here said something like this bra is for old women, perhaps because the lace and lining do not offer much support. Definitely wrong--as I learned when I correctly shortened the straps for a much better fit (and look)."
2,I'm wearing it but not liking it.,"Very scratchy fabric and very uncomfortable. The fit is nice, but I can't stand to have it on all day! Ugh!"
5,Have won this bra for over 20 years,"This bra is discontinued. I was so glad to find it on Amazon. Such a great item - good support, great fit and very comfortable and pretty."
3,"Good bra, bad elastic","I have worn Bali bras for years. They fit well, and these are no exception. Only problem I have is (and this is true of all bras nowadays) the backs stretch out in about an hour. Perfect fit fastened in tightest hooks until then. Guess I will have to start ordering a smaller size and let the back stretch and rehook"
4,It is a repetitive buy. I have been buying this item for many years,"good quality for the price.various colors available; black, nude, whiteI did receive the items in the promised time"
2,Didn't fit right,"It was comfortable, but did not fit at all like I had hoped it would. The cups had pretty much no support, and it even seemed like they had too much material. It sort of bunched up...not attractive. I returned it."
5,Uplifting !,"Congratulations to Bali for making pretty bras with the straps closer together at the front. This seems to be hard to find nowadays and some women perhaps don't realize that they get better uplift when the straps are not so far apart (although the balcony look is very pretty - let's face it, most of us wear our bras under clothes). This bra is comfortable and does the job, while still being feminine."
3,Not the best bra...,"The size is perfect, but the material is really thin/light/flimsy. I like the 3 clasps on the back, but again, the material covering the cups is pretty thin. It gives my boobs a cone shape appearance."
4,Didn't realize this is the actually shows compiled together,"Didn't realize this is the actually shows compiled together, still very good, my child watches this over and over"
4,Hannah one in a million,Has most of the sonds you'd know with some extra's that are good too. Great for the Hannah Fan
1,"""Hannah"" Copying off of ""Raven"" BIG TIME!","That's So Raven is way better than Hannah Montana.I mean, Raven actually is hilarious, is a great actress, and can sing.Miley Cyrus, on the other hand, can't act that good. She is an OK singer, she can only sing Rockish Alternative Pop music because her voice is so raspy.Hannah Montana copies off of That's So Raven in these ways:1. About a pop star, who keeps it a secret from everyone, but her family knows she is Hannah Montana. (Raven is psychic, only her family and friends know. It's a secret from everyone else.)And, that's the biggest CLUE, that Hannah Montana is copying straight off of That's So Raven. Which is still Disney Channel's only show to have 100 episodes.Plus, Hannah Montana's viewers have gone down to 2 million every new episode.It music suck, because That's So Raven drew in over 3 million viewers every episode, and gets 1.8 million viewers on ABC Kids on Saturday Morning.NOW THAT'S TALENT!!!"
3,hanna montana,"My 6 year old grand-daughter loves Hannah Montana. However, I think of this as just watching re-runs of TV, and who wants a child to spend more time in front of the TV?"
1,"Oh sweet Jebus No, No, Nooooooooo!!","Lets nip this trend in the bud before it starts, shall we? The idea of a Hannah M. concert is bad enough; now there is a movie, a la Olsen Twins. Enough with this garbage. How about NOT mindwashing America's kids with this ultra-stupid nonsense? One in a Million? Nope, this mush is all too common.Just because you can make a piece of dreck movie starring an obnoxious no-talent, does not mean that you have to do it.."
5,A Wonderful Metal Epic,"A great album filled with passion. There really are no weak spots in this disk. It is extremely well written and the musical quality branches out past previous WASP albums. I have been a WASP fan since I bought F*** Like A Beat on Vinyl back in the early 80's and while Blackie has always had the ability to write good songs, there has always been a hint of ""glam"" and a question about Wasp's musical ability. Those questions are answered on this album. Along with The Crimson Idol, the Headless Children puts WASP (and especially Blackie Lawless's writing ability) in a class few metal bands have entered and anybody who questions WASP as a ""serious"" metal band have not heard these albums. This is a must have...a true ""desert island"" album. Do yourself a favor and pick it up."
5,Headless Children,"This album is pretty...awesome. The title track is amazing thanks to the one, the only Frankie Banali. The extra tracks on here are great too, (with the exception of the colour-by-numbers version of ""Locomotive Breath"")and even the live tracks shine...I swear, I'll flip out if I see/hear another live version of ""Love Machine"" or ""Blind In Texas"" on a disc. These two versions are full of energy and personality with Blackie pulling some lucky lad out of the crowd to help sing on the chorus of the latter track. Highly recommended."
3,Entertaining,"For me it didn't work as a novel, yet was often very entertaining and clever. It's such a short read, it's worth the effort."
1,Disappointing,"I truly wanted to love this book and thought I would because I love stories with music in the plot. However, this book had no plot. I couldn't remember from one page to the next what happened on the last page. It seemed to be a lot of rambling with run-on sentences that could take up a whole page and paragraphs that went on and on page after page!For the first time in several years, I slammed a book shut without finishing it. I don't know if I'll ever try to read it again. It just made no sense to me. I kept going back to the synopsis on the dust jacket and I didn't find anything in the book even remotely like the synopsis.I made it to page 43...chapter 8. Chapter 7 was one page long...a single sentence. That was all I could take of the book. Perhaps there was something later in the book, but I didn't have any motivation to read one more page. There was just nothing to hold my attention. It was a great sleeping aid.I hate to say this, but this book was a waste of good paper."
1,Not receive!,"I order this DVD August 13th and even if they send me an e-mail saying it was ship 2 days latter, I didn't receive this DVD for more than 3 weeks! I live in Montreal, Canada, not in Siberia!"
4,Juggernaut of Evil,"Emery Boyd is a juggernaut of evil in Ben F. Small's debut thriller, a force of nature nearly as powerful as the mountain on which he preys. Nearly... Not quite. This mountain has surprises gushing all over Mr. Boyd and his best-laid murderous plans.Poor Boyd. What started as a simple stock swindle has turned into blackmail of a federal judge. Then his partner discovers the crime, and Boyd must remove him before his goose is cooked. Where better to put him than Rainier, where mile deep crevasses don't speak? But glaciers move, and Rainier's are full. Seems Boyd's been a busy, busy man.Small brings Rainier alive, makes it tremble and shake, even as the reader too quakes with suspense. This is a great story, and I couldn't put it down.But I have to give it four stars only, just because it's a debut. I expect this author may earn my highest respect with his next effort, if it's as good as this one."
4,Couldn't Set It Down,I do not venture out of the SciFi genre very often and when I do I usually have to work to finish books out of courtesy to those recommending. Alibi On Ice was a pleasent surprise. I could not set it down and read it in two sittings losing some sleep in the process. I felt I knew and understood the characters and itched to know what they did on the next page. Technical content relative to mountaineering was enough to lend credibility to the plot but not overwhelm. The story was deceiving as an apparent clear walk across the glacier with hidden plot complexities not unlike snow coverd crevasses underfoot. Read it!
5,An Italic Calligraphy Handbook,"This book is a solid foundation for learning the skill of Italic Calligraphy. It is well written, with clear instructions for creating each of the letter forms with an Italic calligraphy pen. In addition, the author pays attention to the finer aesthetic details of what it takes to master this beautiful skill. She provides plenty of examples of beautiful and inspiring pieces created by other calligraphy artists, as well as several pages of guidesheets to be used as one learns the letter forms. This is an excellent book--for learning, and as an important addition to the library of anyone interested in the beautiful art of calligraphy--beginner or experienced."
1,Reader Beware !!,"Reader Beware !!The results in this book were optimized using pastdata. Just because what could have been traded in thepast has no bearing on how the markets will react thisyear or in the future.If this book were updated and published today boththe buy and sell dates would be completly different.Even if it was,,,,the chances of profiting from thetrades would be extremly low."
5,wonderful,"As said before, the song is sung in Frisian, which sounds like a mixture of Dutch, German and Scandinavian, and is only spoken in one of the northen provinces in The Netherlands. I don't know which version I have heard, but it is such a wonderful gentle song, and deservedly has been a huge hit in The Netherlands and Belgium. The harmony of their voices together is beautiful. Expect something like one of the ballads from the Cranberries, or maybe a bit like Wenn das Liebe ist by Glashaus (a big hit in Germany)."
4,splendid debut,"This single is really amazing! These 2 young, dutch people have made a splendid debut with wer bisto and I hope lots of these will follow. Their voices submitt to each other like water to rain! Hopefully not only Belgium and The Netherlands will get to know these people but also the rest of Europe and maybe even the world! Thumbs up to Twarres!!!"
4,thanks to Customer Satisfaction Specialist,"after a few problems with the delivery of the item the staff contacted me and make it work, than You very much, I'll buy aggain with you for sure, see you soon!!!"
5,Cheap and well worth it!,I have an old Nikon FM2 that my dad gave to me for my birthday this year. It didn't come with a neck strap and I've known about this camera since I was 5 so that was one of the first things I decided to go for since I already have a 50mm lens that I use with my D80. Excellent length and very grippy to wear over the shoulder. :)
5,"Beautiful, comfortable, discreet.","Soft, comfortable, discreet, inexpensive I like it very much! Too bad it has been discontinued, I don't like the flashy black and yellow new models."
5,Advisable for young piano students,"I was seraching for Beethoven's pieces which are suitable for children, who has not reached yet technically to play sonatines, but wanting to play Beethoven.I came across this book in the local library and was very much delighted, that finally I found something for my son. Pieces are original, easier and yet have typical characteristics of the ""Beethoven Style"". Since I had to return the book, I decided to order myself one, and the Vol. 1 of this series."
2,"neat idea, but bad implementation","These things don't work very well. I originally bought three packs (100 count each) because I was hoping to use one per day and have a 3 year supply for only $3 or so.The 3/4"" of floss on each little plastic thing won't go between all my teeth like my normal wax-coated floss. Either these Kool Floss swords don't use waxed floss, or the floss isn't as thin as my good floss.My teeth are very close together and it's a little tough getting normal (good) floss through the gaps but using the floss swords requires an insane amount of force to drive the string between the teeth. I end up breaking the floss loose from the plastic after only 5-10 teeth :(Don't waste your time with this product unless your teeth are far apart. In that case, you'd probably really enjoy these :)"
5,No movie comes close!,This is a MUST SEE movie! I won't bore you with details. Simply put - GET IT - WATCH IT - TELL OTHERS!
3,Nice Waters Music,"This CD contains a 3 minute song by David Bowie, a horrible song by Hugh Cornwell, a good but not spectacular Genesis instrumental, a surprisingly good song by Squeeze (I was never a fan), a nice new-age jazz number from Paul Hardcastle and a 25 minute piece from Roger Waters, listed as the last 8 tracks on the CD. The Roger Waters piece starts out with an excellent 7 minute song. The next 12 minutes are space music, noises and clips from the movie. Some it is very good but those parts only last a minute or so and are interpersed between parts that are only of entertainment value in the context of the movie. The last 6 minutes is another song that is on par with the better things on Radio Kaos, (some interesting parts but overall nothing special). There is a great female singer, excellent sax from Mel Collins, and some good guitar playing (but Andy Fairweather-Low is not on this CD as someone said). If you want more info you might want to check out artist-shop."
5,It's an ill wind that blows..,"I must have seen this film a hundred times since it's original release in 1986. Every time I see it I am moved to tears, the only film that has ever done that to me. There is nothing to fault this film. The style of animation changes throughout to match the mood at the time, the music fits the images exactly (perfectly composed by Roger Waters of Pink Floyd fame). The characters are so believable, everybody knows a couple just like them. The dialogue is perfection, sometimes you don't know whether to laugh or cry. When the picture finishes I have to take a moment to compose myself each and every time. Everybody should be made to watch this film at least once in their lives."
4,More like a singles album,"With Roger Waters' songs on this album clocking in at under half an hour, it is hard for for much filler to exist. But exist it does in what appears to be more background soundtrack than actual songs. The two real songs, Towers of Faith and Folded Flags, are top notch Waters solo efforts. I would place them in ranks with his best stuff on Amused to Death and better than anything on Radio K.A.O.S. , or at least equal to The powers that be or home. Folded Flags should have taken the place of The Tide is Turning on KAOS, I think it suits the darker mood of the album better. The two Waters songs are relatively easy to obtain by digital piracy. I am not saying you should go download them, that is simply a fact. Oh, and the bowie song is good too."
1,Where's the Waters?,"In a word, disappointing. Maybe I didn't read close enough, but I thought I was getting something that resembled Roger Waters. If that's what you are looking for, you should seriously consider buying something else."
5,Where do I get it?,"I would really like to have the movie, book and CD but I am unable to find them? I am sure they are worth enjoying. Why can I not purchase them ""anymore"" as in Unavailble.?"
3,"charming, tragic and still worth watching","A somewhat dated, yet still touching and still very relevant story of an English elderly couple who follow the directions of a government-produced brochure on how to survive The Bomb. Charming and tragic all at once. Another cinematic reminder of what would *really* happen if a nuclear war took place. This film is very hard to find. It may not turn out to be your favorite film of all time, and I don't think it's as good a movie as ""Testament"", but if it shows up at your local art house, don't miss it."
2,I'd give this book a C-,"Eh. That is what this book is. The character sounds so dorky and weird and then this huge stoner guy likes the same dorky weird things? um no. I dont connect to her at all and him-only slightly. Plus, the way this book skips over time periods..... it started with her as a sophomore i think...although age is only described in the descriptin of the book, and his age is never mentioned....it ends a year and 1 month later with basically nothing accomplished. The ending is the worst and could have been much much better with a few more pages added on. This book was very eh..."
2,Too much gossipy drama and not enough of the Man and his Art...,"Was expecting more of the great things about Montgomery Clift (his acting approach and preparation, working relationships with theater/film professionals, et.al). What I viewed was more of the same: his drug/alcohol problems, sexual confusion and so forth. Not much to recommend here..."
1,Huh?,"I didnt buy this but I was looking around at related products. 79 bucks for a couple brushes, roller and cheap razor blade, sizors and putty knife. This is a rip off! you could get all this at Walmart for 20."
4,Take care of yourself,Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be easier when you have information about your food choices. America needs to sit up and pay attention!
3,don't own it yet a but I'm going to and,for a lot less than $399.99. Movies unlimited has the complete 30 episode series for $59.99Can you guess which one I will buy?
3,content,"Besides the shipment arrived on time, when I got the shipment the hair conditioner was a little bit open so about 10 ml were spread around the box. Also, I did not like the fragance."
5,Great Product!,This is the best smelling shampoo and conditioner that I can think of. My girlfriend has tried several other brands and this one just works best for her hair.
1,Ripped Off,"Buyer Beware!!I believe I was ripped off when I received this product from ""All in Beauty"". Cheap imposter! Neither the shampoo or conditioner has the mint tingle at all. And both products smell like cheap Men's cologne!"
3,Product is great,"Unfortunately both pumps arrived broken (smashed). Fortunately, I still had old ones of the same product and could swap them out."
3,Interesting fiction,"I knew Dick Sherman personally (Actually, I held up his T-34 checkout at McClellan AFB, CA because my instructor misread the schedule, and we flew an hour past our time...Dick was gracious, though, and thankfully his flight was rescheduled without delay. He also gave me a copy of his book). This story highlights a fictitious colonel's battle between the inherently sexist nature of military life, and his personal struggle to regiment his flagging fighter squadron, which includes a female lieutenant. The colonel's group is suddenly thrust into a shooting war, and mettle is tested among the neophyte combatants. Dick's pen leans to the left on his socio-political observations, but having flown with him, I'd say he's a decent, knowledgable individual who knows the ropes of combat flying."
4,Honest Sellers,The sellers were very honest concerning the condition of this used book. I found it to be kept very well for being roughly over 10 years old; there were only minor scratches and one scuff on the cover and some of the normal wear and tear associated with used paperbacks. I feel you can buy from this seller with confidence.Happy reading!
3,Talking Heads... Talking,"Though interesting, I found it a bit tough to sit through. Partially because the sound level varied depending on who was speaking -- which was distracting, but also it was a little dull. Most of the interviewees were not exactly riveting to watch (despite having important stories to tell). Very ""just the facts ma'am"" in most cases. It's good to have the Mauchly story presented/preserved and I guess I'm glad I watched it. But I don't know who I would recommend it to. Much preferred: Top Secret Rosies: The Female 'Computers' of WWII"
3,Disappointing if you need to ID a doll,"I normally enjoy Jan's works on dolls. However, I was disappointed by the lack of documentation on such important features as marks and identification of manufacturers. I realize no book can be the definitive documentation on all dolls ever produced, but had Jan included more specific information, it would have eliminated some matches for me. As such, even for dolls I might have considered mine to be, I couldn't match or dismiss them."
4,Must Have Book for All Doll Collectors,"This book will help all collectors, experienced to novice, to identify and price dolls. Set up simply, it's easy to find the doll you're looking for. If you can only buy one doll book, buy this one. It's the book doll prices are based on."
4,Blue Book Review,"The Blue Book contains a terrific amount of information for all collectors! It is a guide, and market conditions greatly influence any price - so prices do vary. A great carry along to any auction, or sale! I wish that the Antique and Modern doll information would be split into two books - as I find it a bit distracting having to wade through information I am not interested in. Hopefully in the future this can be done and there will be a strictly antique and a separate modern value guide.All-in-all, a fantastic reference guide to prices and identification."
1,Worst book by Rick Steves,"I'm a Rick Steves fan. In our yearly vacations to Europe, his books were always the most accurate, detailed and useful.But this one is really different, as if there is some (political? commercial?) agenda behind it - for example -- Gimmelwald as the center of the Bernese Oberland alps? Are you insane? A vilage with two BB and no restaurants... Is someone reviewing these books?- And Grindelwald (there) is only mentioned as a side comment while it is the largest resort in that area.Not even mentioning that Geneva is poorly covered (not interesting...). And these are only the items I've seen until now.If you are going to Switzerland, specially if focusing on the Bernese Oberland, do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. Don't even read it because you will only get confused, specially if you used to believe Rick Steves."
1,Geneva is ommitted,I bought this book because I am planning a trip to Geneva--but Geneva is completely omitted from the book! It is not even listed in the index. Buying this book was a waste of time and money for me.
3,A good general book on Switzerland,"As usual, Rick Steves provides solid suggestions for restaurants, hotels, and sights, and much of his information is dependable. I was disappointed, however, by his rather condescending attitude toward Zurich, where I recently spent a week on business. The city is lovely, and there are a lot of inexpensive options that don't involve spending a lot of money in this generally pricey city. One of the ""must visit"" restaurants he recommended turned out to be mediocre and very expensive and he has very little on the Kunsthaus, one of the best museums in Europe. If you want a book with a more balanced view of Switzerland, I recommend Frommer's or Lonely Planet."
2,"Opinionated is OK, but...","I like Rick Steves's approach to travel, and much of this book is helpful. BUT: He purposely, and dismissively, leaves out the entire city of Geneva, calling it ""boring."" Well, when you're basing your trip in Geneva, that's not really news you can use. I think Steves's success has gone to his head -- this level of opinionated advice is useless at best, irresponsible at worst. If you want a comprehensive guide to Switzerland, try Fodor's."
3,A WARNING BOOK - Switzerland is EXPENSIVE,"The first question: Where are the pictures? As a born Swiss (living in the U.S.A.) I read it anyway. It's a lot text about (almost) everything and it's also a ""Price List CH 2007"". Probably you'll find this book in your library, that's for free . . . ."
3,Its a okay starter book...,"I bought Rick Steve bcoz of the hype... apparently, this is a starter book, gives the basics. Rick Steve ignores Gstaad as a touristy town, but if you skip those few streets which are indeed touristy, this place has one of the most beautiful panoramic landscapes in Switzerland. Gstaad region is the main highlight of the Golden pass rail between Zweisimmen and Montreaux.Gimmelwald depicts a true Swiss village, beautiful place portrayed well in his book.I strongly suggest going over the forums on Trip Advisor for reviews and lodging information."
2,Not what I expected,There was no attempt to take advantage of the digital format. The maps were difficult to read. There were no hyperlinks between points on the mays and descriptions. And the scope of Switzerland was thinly covered. I usually like Rick's advice. It was very dissappointing.
2,I want my money back,"I should have read the reviews before I bought this. As many others have mentioned, there is only one passing mention of Geneva - don't come here looking for ANY recommendations about that city. I'd never bought a Rick Steves book before this one, so I don't know if this is common or not, but if he wants to make a book about his ""top picks"" of Switzerland, OK. But tell us that first. I was expecting a full guide to Switzerland, which this isn't.Also, the quality of the illustrations is terrible. I'm not sure if this is because it's a Kindle edition, or if it's because I'm reading it on an iPad Kindle app, but the photographs are tiny - and all in B&W; - and not zoomable. The maps are the same way; by the time you zoom them so you can actually see them, they're illegible due to deterioration in image quality.I'd really like my money back for this one."
1,Does not include Geneva,My partner has a meeting in Geneva so I will be there for at least 4 days. I bought this book that is worthless to me. I cannot believe he omits one of the largest cities in Switzerland.
5,Rick compares Geneva to Buffalo and Cleveland.,"I trust Rick to steer me in the right direction on my trips to Europe. As for Geneva and other spots not mentioned in the country, he concentrates on what he thinks makes for the best two- to three-week adventure. And yes Gimmelwald is small, but right in the center of some great activities in the Berner Oberland.As for Geneva, I'll skip seeing the expensive shopping and watches there, miss the lake fountain and head straight for the mountains.""Geneva (Switzerland) and Grenoble (France) share the ""nice place to live but I wouldn't want to visit"" award. Both are pleasantly situated on a lake--like Buffalo and Cleveland. And both are famous, although name familiarity is a rotten reason to go somewhere. If you want a Swiss city, see Bern, but it's almost criminal to spend a sunny Swiss day anywhere but high in the Alps."" -Rick Steves"
1,No mention of Geneva????,"How can you have a Swiss travel guide that does not mention Geneva???? Nuff said. Rick, I love your suitcase but no more of your guide books for me."
5,A Classic in the Field,This book is a classic and definitive reference book for every clinical psychologist and psychotherapists in other professions. It would also be informative to the educated non-practitioner who wants to learn more about the field of psychotherapy.
5,THE reference for psychotherapy research,"At first read, I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information in this book. However, as I have used it more, I have come to appreciate the clarity of the writing, the quality of the research, and the experience of the writers. Every clinician should read this book. It has inspired me to view research as a necessary component of good practice."
4,"Simple, Colorful","I purchased this book because it was part of the continued reading list for Teach Your Child To Read In 100 Easy Lessons. My daughters like it a lot and my 7y.o. asks if she can read it to her dad and grandparents.It's a very simple book with few words and bold colors...a great confidence booster, yet doesn't loose a child's interest."
4,A student favorite,"I bought this to replace my classroom copy. It is very popular amongst my beginning readers! The text gives them good practice with word endings, and they are encouraged to use the illustrations to supplement the story."
1,Doesn't fit stock D40/D40x lens,"While I should have been more careful, as this lens cap is included in my search for ""Nikon D40 Lens Cap"" I assumed it would fit the 52mm kit lens included with my D40.Guess what, it does not! And it's different than the picture here. At $6.95 it's not even worth the time to return it. If you're considering this item, beware!The lack of specifications provided in the item description should have been a red flag, but I am still very dissatisfied."
5,Snap on lens caps,Nikon snap on lens covers are great and stay on. I wouldn't put cheap brands on my Nikon camera to save a dollar.
1,Disappointing,"I was looking for patterns and was very disappointed! The picture on the cover of the book illustrates more animals than there are patterns or instructions for in the book. There is no pattern for the Ark. His carving style is not what I was looking for or wanted, but I was not able to clearly discern his style from the cover illustration. His carving of Mrs. Noah is a caricature, and his carving of the animals is rustic. I will not use the books myself but may donate them to our carving club's library for use by beginning carvers. If the publisher had allowed the ""Look Inside"" function, I would not have purchased the book."
1,P.O.S. Do I have to give it one star?,"If you've allready purchased this, I sincerely wish you the best of luck getting your money back...It actually sends a signal to Garageband, however it's so weak that it hardly registers.It's a sham product."
1,Phar lap,"This is so disappointing .. This movie is great, and I have been looking to buy the movie for years, on a DVD.. Why won't you make this into a DVD for region 1 ? There are so many people that would love to own this movie here in the United States.. Please consider the idea. Thank you, for letting us know that DVD will not work in our region !!"
5,Amazing Movie,"This was a wonderful movie and a complete tear jerker!! No matter how many times I see it, it makes me cry!! This movie needs to be released to dvd format!! There are many people out there that feel the same way I do!! I would be one of the first in line to buy this!!!"
5,PharLap,"I saw this movie when it first came out - yeah way back in 1984! I taped it off of what was then cable. It IS a fantastic movie about a fantastic horse. The price being asked for the PharLap movie is outrageous when you look at what ""Seabiscuit"" is being sold for!!! $54.95 for PharLap????!!!! Yeah its a great story about a great horse - but get real!!!! Hey Amazon, check out who is selling what on your site!! What an outrageous amount for a video that is YEARS old!! What a RIP OFF!! Anyone want this movie, watch AMC, TCM, PBS or any cable network that shows old movies! Pay $54.95? NEVER!!"
1,Very Unhappy,"I was so glad to find this video on the web. It took a little longer to ship but when I finally got it I couldn't play it. The message says ""PLAYBACK IS NOT AUTHORIZED IN YOUR REGION"". Is there something that I need to do? Can I still get this to play on my dvd player? If not why wasn't I informed of this at the time of the purchase. What does region 2 mean? I'm not familiar with this."
1,Phar Lap VHS,Tape was a pirated copy. Labels on tape and on plastic box were fabricated to look like an old video store rental. Seller refunded $.
3,Good but not the greatest,"He was a great horse but let's be real. Statements that he'd beat Secretariat by a length are ridiculous. Yes, let's just ignore the fact that Phar Lap never once matched Secretariat's fastest times at 1.25, 1.5 or anything in between. Secretariat STILL retains some world records. No horse has ever even broken 2:25 in 1.5 on dirt and Secretariat did it a full second faster. At his fastest, no thoroughbred in history could defeat him.Please."
3,Its A Kiwi Horse,"I would like to just clear this up that Phar Lap was a New Zealanders horse not an Australians, Aussies like to claim alot of New Zealanders like Russell Crowe.As for the movie it was great."
4,The little horse that could,"Engaging tale about a little horse that didn't seem to be worth anything that was trained and became a winner, eventually causing more and more weight to be put on the horse so the racing would be even.Eventually it was to his demise. His saddle was used by the guy that was the substitute rider forSeabiscuit: An American Legend"
3,Second edition,"I recently purchased this book from sitepoint after people ranted and raved about how good it was. I can honestly say, that it is not that spectacular. There are far more other books on the subject of PHP that teach the same thing that are MUCH better than this.Sometimes when you are complete NOVICE you need a book that will ""hold your hand"" along the way, this book does not do that it assumes you have an idea of it already.My suggestion, is dont bother.. Look for something else instead"
1,Build Your Own Database Driven Website Using PHP & MySQL,"Thank god the 1st 4 chapters of this book are free. As I need to build a website using mysql & php, I thought this book would be exactly what I needed. I already know sql & html and only needed to know php and how to connect the three. Unfortunately none of the code in the book actually works. Having programmed before I know you cannot call variables without declaring them first (quite a stupid mistake for someone who calls hiself a glorious leader). changing a method from get to post can't really be done that way either!!!I would have expected Kevin to have at least checked his code before publising. All in all quite a useless book, specially for a beginner. Not worth 1 star but Amazon doesn't allw 0 stars."
3,"Introduction for beginners, has technical flaws","I'd like to recommend this book because there is a lot going for it. The text is readable. The illustrations and screenshots are well done. And the book presents a nice learning curve from beginner to reasonably high level concepts. But the book has some technical flaws that other beginning PHP books do not. An example is the authors use of SQL, a primary feature of this type of book, which is implemented using string concatenation. This type of SQL is not only inefficient, it's also prone to SQL injection attacks which means that any code based on this book will have serious security issues.There are some very good parts, however. The chapter that introduces relational databases is very well done.I recommend O'Reilly's Learning PHP 5 as an alternative to this book."
2,Lightweight,"To my absolute amazement, this is a $... book with no rendered HTML anywhere in it...It's thin, goes into way too much depth on installation issues and almost no depth into the core stuff.Lower the price, show us the rendered HTML, and then it may turn out to be a good book. In the meantime, this is the first and last time I trust a review on slashdot...."
2,It's so drousy......zzzzzzzzzz..,"Most often when I begin with a book teaching computer language I'm very excited and eager, and usually I am rewarded with a good experience. But after reading Kevin Yanks Book I'm sorry to say that the adjectives that pops up in my mind is: insufficient and boring. Insufficient because the text do not explane the PHP language in the examples given and because one need some actual (allready made) tables for the examples. It is boring because of the way it is written, the typograhy and the lack of ""candy for the eyes"" in the resulting pages of the examples. Allthough I've read the second edition (which just arrived I believe!) I must say that this book needs another rewriting! Find some more exiting database-examples, make the typograhy more clear, make the resulting HTML-pages more interesting and last but not least: be sure to explain what you do in the given examples."
2,Excellent for beginners,"I read this book in about 2 days and have built a working database for the web in about 3 days. This book has very good explanations and shows lines as they should basically be. I have only a few programming classes under my belt and no real-world application development and have done it! The database works well, looks great on the web and I owe it all to this book.It was much appreciated to have the ""whys"" answered so clearly. I would recommend this book to every php&mysql beginner."
4,Great Intro book to PHP programming with MySQL,"I throughly enjoyed the book. Kevin Yank writes very well and makes the book an easy read and gets you excited about developing your own database driven application. It was just the book I was looking for to getting started with PHP and MySQL web development. I wouldn't recommend it for seasoned PHP and MySQL programmers and the book is the on thin side to be of any use as reference, but it's very excellent for beginners. I'll probably invest in a more robust PHP and MySQL web development book in the future."
4,Note that reviews below canNOT reflect SECOND edition,"Just a ""heads-up"": Hopefully you are looking at the Amz site for the SECOND edition, said to have come out March 2003, ISBN 0-957-92181-0. In that case there may have been significant enhancements to cover some objections mentioned below (which, by their dates must refer to first edition). I've not been able to find in a book store to evaluate it (hoping SOMEBODY out there will), but the SitePoint site says about this edition:*Fully updated for PHP 4.3*Installation instructions for Mac OS X* Full index provided* New WIDER book size* Enhanced fonts* Lay-flat spine* All content revisited.Note also that at the publisher's site you can DL the First 4 chapters free - which, I guess, will need to be my next stopping point if none of you can find a physical copy to review either."
3,Dives in too quickly for intended audience,"I'm an experienced HTML coder, whose only thorough programming training is in Actionscript (for Flash). Ready to tackle dynamic HTML pages as well as flash pages, I bought this book, only to find that it gives so little attention to basic programming concepts that I'm pretty sure I would have been very confused if I had not known Actionscript beforehand.Who is this good for? Someone experienced with HTML and familiar with Javascript, C, or another language with similar syntax. It is not for the beginning web designer who doesn't know how a ""for"" loops works.With my experience, I was able to work through this book and learn a few things; however, my bias for ""beginner books"" and ""teach yourself books"" remains towards those that truly ease you into the topic"
3,Pretty Basic - Good for Beginners,This is not a work for the more advanced developer. It's basic. The one good think I found was that the explanation on how to install PHP with IIS is the best explanation I've seen in a book. I am not unhappy for buying the book but ...
4,PHP for Dumb Me,I hit on SitePoint while working on a php/mysql project for a degree I am working on. First of all I appreciated that a lot of Kevin's book was already online and that SitePoint decided to share that with neophytes like myself. Kevin has a gift for explaining clearly the theory and also for how to practically get started. I downloaded a number of classes on php duringmy project but Kevin's was at the top.This in turn encouraged me to purchase the book. In this regards the ordering and delivery were very smooth even though I live in France.
4,Excellent practical knowledge,"This book is filled with lots of great practical examples on which to build. Kevin Yank provides just enough technical background to let you see how PHP and MySQL can be used for more complex applications without slowing you down. If you've been wanting to move on from plain ol' HTML pages, this is the book for you."
2,ROURKE AND HOPKINS WILL HELP YOU TO FORGET THE PLOT HOLES! 2 1/2 STARS!,"I had high hoped for this one, but too many contrivances and plot holes made my hopes disintegrate right before my eyes. Rourke and Hopkins do their best to keep this one from completely failing and keep it somewhat entertaining if you don't think about it too much.Look for it on cable as I can't see sitting through this one more than once."
2,Ugh,"This actually could have been a very watchable movie; Anthony Hopkins would be excellent anytime. Micky Rourke is better than usual. Mimi rogers is great. two things make it not so good. Comparing this to the original; there just isn't a comparison. & Lindsay Crouse...oh man, she's painful in this one. she has a very, I mean very, bad southern accent & it ruins the film."
3,If you can sit long enough...It's worth seeing.,"It's a good movie but very slow at the beginning. Both Rourke and Hopkins give great performances; however there are cheesy moments in the movie. Such as the unnecessary partial nudity to keep the audiences' attention and the rebel, tough daddy's girl. Also, the cliche' dialog between the FBI agents on the tail of Rourke's character. Even with those moments, it's worth seeing if you can sit long enough to get to the dramtic ending."
5,trx eletric scooter,This scooter is the best. It is fun safe and harde to flip over. It can go fast but it is still safe and durrable.I have taken it on steep grass hills and it still dose fine although i have had to get a new battery this scooter is fun.
1,One Star Rating,"I only give this one star because I've had nothing but problems with it from day one. I've read some of the reviews and agree that this scooter is unsafe. Once the front end pops up and rolls on the back wheels you have no control over the steering. You can usually pop it back down but it gives you kind of a scarey feeling. The battery discharges way too soon. At first it would go for several minutes before needing a recharge and now, after a few weeks, won't go for longer than maybe 8 minutes. I've also looked at some of the reviews like the one that says ""bad batteries...it happens"" Yeah, it happens! And when it happens to you, it isn't just a casual problem. Good luck finding a new one! I refuse to deal with Sunco customer service any longer. They really should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to sell this product. I have addressed a strong letter to Toys R Us in regards to this scooter and Sunco. Maybe that is why it is on clearance."
4,"FUNNY, UGLY NUNS","If the last Pope was John Paul. Why isn't the new one George Ringo?Irreverent Catholic humour abounds in NUNS ON THE RUN (Anchor Bay), a low brow romp that follows Eric Idle and Robbie Coltrane -- two crooks with loot taken from bigger crooks -- into a convent where they don habits and pretend to be nuns assigned to teaching young girls.I laughed out loud at these desperate, inept, ugly nuns and their silly complications."
4,GREAT,The movie was ok but it did lack a few things. The movie was very funny but its humor was based on dressing like a nun. But if you like that sort of thing or a big Eric Idle Fan (Monty Python) this is a must get. END
3,Good fun!,"Really a lot more entertaining than it should be, this is to all intents and purposes a one-gag film. Petty crooks Brian (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame) and Charlie (Robbie Coltrane) are on the run from the police after they have a plan to steal a suitcase full of money from the Triads and then run off to Brazil with it. So in an attempt to ""go straight"" they hide out in a convent dressed as nuns, attempting to pass themselves off as the genuine article.With its' mix of slapstick and some crude gags (Nun to Robbie Coltrane who wants him to teach a class: Do you have experience with 18 year old girls? Robbie: Yes, plenty) , the film cant hide its British origins and has a very 80's feel. The film provides some good laughs though as Brian and Charlie get into comic scrapes trying to avoid the Triads, the Police, and also Brian's girlfriend Faith, he can't let her guess he is hiding out in the convent."
5,Will watch it over and over..........,"This movie never loses it's timeless comedy style. Robbie Coltrane and Eric Idle will always be two of my favorites just because of this movie. It's just so silly, yet the serious side of what they are involved in, is hardly skipped over. After one of their 'partners in crime', a poor hapless little fellow named Norm, is eliminated by their horrible mob-boss, Casey, basically to teach Charlie (Coltrane) and Brian (Idle) a very hard lesson, the two very unhappy criminals set out to 'go straight'! Obviously, after that, hilarity ensues! After they end up in the convent, dressed as nuns, (which wouldn't fool anyone, I'm sure), Brian yells at Charlie-'You call this, going straight?' Anyway, great film, lots of fun and the good guys come out OK in the end. The quality of the film is top-notch, brand new, as promised and I was very happy to finally have a perfect copy of this awesome film. Thank you for very good service and a perfect product. I am 100% satisfied."
4,Nuns on the Run Lots of Laughs!,"Hey, it's Eric Idle with nuns and slapstick humor and sort of a crazy Billy Wilder type plot. It's sort of predictable but I've watched it probably a dozen times and it's always good for putting you in a good mood."
4,Interesting but Biased,"An intriguing read, but definitely biased against Pope Benedict because of a liberal slant. Readers of America magazine will love this book. Readers of First Things magazine will despise it. I think that both sets of readers will find it a fascinating book, though."
1,Another old hack dissing the Pope,"Well well, what can one expect from Mr.Gibson? He is of the ""Catholic"" dissident mold, the type that never tire of throwing out the old ""causes"" of the liberal 60's and 70's even though the Church (thank God) is finaly past that stage. The book gives a fairly good background on the Holy Fathers early days, but it is full of Gibson's tired old ""change the Church so we can be more like protestants agenda."""
5,Read this only if you,"are completely up-to-date on the papacy or are a complete newbie to the papacy. This book is:THOROUGHPROVOKINGALMOST-TOO-WELL-WRITTENGibson is unable to contain his knowledge, passion, and exciting diction.Made me wish I were Catholic.- Cole"
1,"Dave Gibson is a Loser, Benedict is a Winner","Gibson is a biased writer with no understanding of what it means to be Catholic. Gibson wants to throw away 2,000 years of tradition and make the Church another protestant denomination. The new Pope is a blessing but Gibson is trying to make a buck selling this book to protestants."
1,"If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen","I do not like this book because I think Pope Benedict is a very holy man, strong as a rock in his love for Christ and His Church! This is the type of leader the world needs! Unwavering in his principles which are firmly founded in God's Revelation. I am very happy that the author is a convert to Catholicism but faith is not like a cafeteria, that one pick and choose what one would like to savor. If you are an authentic Catholic, you are convinced that the Church throughout the ages has been passing on the fullness of truth revealed by God to His flock. If you don't like that, then please, no one is forcing you to remain. Go and find a denomination that better suits your taste and preference. As for me, I remain with Holy Father Benedict XVI, because where Peter is, there is the Church, and there is Christ."
1,Broke after just 1 year,"Don't buy this machine. The ink jet printer is not a good quality. I don't know why Amazon still sell this. I'm just looking for another printer, just for one year."
2,Will not fax without ink,"So frustrating that this unit will not fax out without all of the color cartridges in perfect working order. I never use the color ink, yet have to replace them in order to send a fax. I swore the last time I bought a brother that I would not do it again. Unfortunately, it was my only choice at a local store. Only thing nice is that the cartridges are still readily available."
1,Waste of money,"After four months of use,it suddenly went crazy.When I installed a new ink cartridge after it ran out of ink,it keeps stating ""NO CARTRIDGE"" and stopped functioning.I had my friends checked it, and still not working--keeps flashing the stupid ""NO CARTRIDGE"".What a waste of money.I will never buy anything from BROTHER.And by the way, the message center of the machine is also crappy."
4,Dagmar's Book,I found this book absolutely delightful. Dagmar had so many interesting adventures. She has a wry way of putting things. It makes one wonder how she was able to make it through the experiences she had without becoming a bitter old woman. I really appreciate this reading experience.
5,A must see.,"I haven't laughed this hard at a television show in a long time. David Cross is fantastic, and Will Arnett is great as always. Contrary to some reviews, you needn't be a fan of the actors past collaborations to enjoy this program."
3,Eh. Not for me.,"If you love David Cross' shtick or are one of those rabid fans of Arrested Development then you'll probably like this fish-out-of-water story. I read about this show somewhere online and thought I'd give it a try because the setup read funny to me. Found it predictable, not terribly funny or clever & a little tiresome, but it wasn't awful."
4,Love David Cross,"I love the comedic acting of David Cross! I watched the first season of Todd Margaret and enjoyed it. Mr. Cross' work as Tobias Fünke on Arrested Development is genius. And I almost never say that about anyone.The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret is unusual and dark, but funny."
3,"Funny, but...","Todd is incredibly unlikeable and his situations are so unrealistic that it's impossible to root for him. I'm only giving the show three stars because I chuckled a few times.None of the characters are that likeable, though, including Todd's gross pregnant neighbor and his ""boss,"" played by Will Arnett, who mistakes swearing for funny. I got tired of his character five seconds after meeting him.And I still never understood Todd's sole employee...whatever his name is. Though he shows more depth than anyone else on the show, he got on my nerves too.I'm guessing the show was cancelled, though I couldn't see it going far anyway because of its silly plot and dumb characters, but I had fun while it lasted."
4,Impress Your Friends...,...by introducing them to this great overlooked comedy. You can even claim to be one of those intellectual types and tell them you watch the IFC all the time or that you're sophisticated and actually understand the underpinnings of British comedy. Maybe you're a college student and have realized that girls just don't go for guys with huge South Park collections. Try leaving the raunchy yet sweetly humorous Todd Margaret DVDs out on your coffee table and watch your luck with the ladies do a 180.
5,Definitely Recommend,"First, if you've seen or read Ouran High School Host Club and love it, this is definitely something to check out! It's got the same kind of talented, genius kids at a rich school layout. But, for the yaoi lovers, there's no girls! What a plus! It's got talented voice actors, such as Ken Narita (Inuyasha's Sesshoumaru) and many more! It's sweet and romantic, with lots of fun suggestiveness and many cute pairings for you to go all dreamy~eyed over. It's a must buy for any shounen~ai lover! Though it's definitely not hard core yaoi, it's still brilliant, beautifully drawn, amazing music, and just plain fun."
2,Irritating format,"I have found the dual-page format used by Murach to be very irritating. The reader gets lulled into thinking he can skip the summary page on the right if the left page is read -- but WAIT, there are two or three words of important information that was not mentioned on the left page!! The end result is that the reader is forced to read 95% of the information twice! Once on a single page and then again in summary form on the very next page and you dare not skip it!The couple of Authors who write Murach's books seem to be little more than contract writers with little experience in any one specific area of programming. However, if you can stand the format, they have done some research work on the topics they write about but they are also quick to bail out on you when real expertise is needed. Thats my $.02 worth."
2,Disappointed,"I am very experienced with VB.NET and other programming languages, but new to any form of ASP. I didn't like this book very much. There is nothing wrong with the information, but it is not very well organized.The early chapters mix basic and more advanced information in the paragraph. He often presents stuff that I am in no postion to understand until more basic concepts have been covered. He also introduces concepts that I will not use until much later. I would rather learn about something and use it immediately. Other topics can wait until I have to use them.I can learn ASP.Net from this book, but it seems like a lot more work than it should be.Also, his habit of repeating the same thing on the left and right page annoys me. I suppose some people like the instant review"
1,Sucks,"Most people learn hands-on, and this book is less than hands-on. Sure there's exercises at the end of each chapter, but while you're learning the material in the chapter there's almost no activities to review what you're learning. I found that I didn't understand a lot of it because of this format. Plus the two-page format is very irritating, so the bulk of the book is not worth the price.Bottom line, there are other, better, more hands-on books out there."
5,Great Book!,What an excellent book. I got this book along with Anne Prince's vb.net book (also outstanding) and what a great combination they are. I only wish that more technical books were written this well. Excellent job by the authors: Doug Lowe and Anne Prince.
5,SUPERB,"Simply said: One of the best books I have ever bought!I needed to dive into ASP.NET pretty fast because I had a project running to its deadline. I was a programmer who knew Visual Basic and Delphi pretty well. I did know the theory of ASP.NET but had no practical experience. This book teached me in a record time how to build and get my first web application up and running.The best starter's book you can imagine. The second book I bought on the subject was ASP.NET Unleashed, which is a marvellous book if you have some ASP.NET experience.For a beginner Murach's book is simply a dream, and although I have written a couple of web applications now, I still use it as a quick reference. WORTH EVERY PENNY IN GOLD."
1,Fun for kids not teenagers or adults,"I am 18 years old, and I feel to old for this tape. On halloween, my class went on a field trip, me and another classmate stayed back, and found my self watching this in another classroom. In the tape, Elmo visits the Count in his castle. And gets scared for a minute. And then we hear 15 jokes. And have to sit through songs like, ""Tryansylvania 1-2-3-4-5"", ""We Are All Monstars"" and ""Frazzle"". The reason why I am giving this one star, because doing this film, people were talking and walking in front of the tv. If your kids are a fan of Sesame Street, have them watch, Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird, and if they are not Sesame Street fan, have them watch a comedy movie like Shrek."
