2,Sorry to say---,"I wrote a glowing review about the Toshiba 27A50 but have since had a problem with poor warrany service. I had to return the 27A50 to the company for full refund after four months of trying to resolve the situation. I am sorry to say considering the problems,I doubt that I would purchase another Tosiba product."
3,Good series for history buffs,"I remember when this series came out on TV. I was very excited that they were showing American Indians in a pretty good light. I was disappointed that the series ended after only a few episodes. I'm not an expert on the French and Indian War, but it seems fairly accurate to me. I'm not sure if I agree with the Indians torturing their captive, but most else is good. Costumes are okay. Acting is pretty good. Some humor. The quality of the filming is pretty good for such an old tape. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the episodes."
5,MOST EXCELLENT - GREAT SCENERY,This was an excellent portrayal of frontier life by Lee Horsley and Linda Carter.Have been looking forever for it to come out on DVD.It has a flavor of the English and French conflict and the brutality of the time.I loved L.C.'s comment of how her character fell in lust with L.H.'s character.DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED FOR A CHARACTER LOVE STORY.
3,Not Quite The Lamb Chops I Expected,"I'm not sure whether the version I saw is the full uncut version but it's Cat III and purchased on DVD in Hong Kong itself. Being a gorehound, and using other Hong Kong fare such as ""The Ebola Syndrome"", ""Prostitute Killer"" and ""The Untold Story"" (amongst others) as benchmarks, ""Dr Lamb"" is rather mild. Typical of the HK formula at the time, where the film is really about flashbacks as the killer confesses to his crimes, ""Dr Lamb"" is only marginally violent considering the modus operandi of the killer (dismemberment). Very few (and brief) close ups of the sordid violence, only the sprayed blood gives any indication of what actually went on. Story has a good premise (that weirdos are the result of what happened to them during childhood) but that's about it. In short, the film could have upped its ante but it didn't."
4,GBV history book,"Yeah, pretty innaresting stuff. Just wish Greer could keep his tongue outta the back of Pollards trousers."
5,"Subspace Biographies, indeed","A must-have for the members of various Guided by Voices fanclub/cults such as Postal Blowfish, Disarm The Settlers and Strong Lions. Spouses/significant others who have been amused or abused by the band and their fanatic following will no doubt enjoy as well.And if reading the above paragraph makes no sense, then you Must Buy this book. Compulsive GbV fans of course will HAVE to get a copy, but others should read if they want a glimpse into the story of Wondering Boy Poet Robert Pollard. A great xmas gift for the indie music fan."
3,a nice resource for the unobsessed,"It is interesting to read the different reviews here. I think the criticisms reveal more about the critics than the book. I agree with the following shortcomings: not enough about the musical process, approach, and details of album making. (Bee 1000 is a masterpiece and it is good to hear from Pollard's website that a scholar is devoting a single work to the album.) Even if Greer is a ""yesman"" as a reviewer suggests, he still provides fruitful insights and titillating minutae that the lay-listener enjoys (see the praising reviews). Of course, the worshippers and indie-obsessor's already know all of these minutae and so are rather demanding. So, another book, less ""inside,"" is certainly in order; one that reveals more about the specifics of Pollard's musical process. But give Greer a break! He's provided a nice resource for the unobsessed."
5,The Bus Will Get You There Yet,"Here it is. One volume with a large enough slice of the trials and tribulations of the indie rocks own musical cornucopia, Robert Pollard. This book traces GBV from first to last, including coverage of the legendary last show (New Year's Eve 2004/Chicago). The book is witty, funny and easy to read. The introduction is written by the director of ""Traffic"" and is one of the most original and entertaining introductions I have ever read. For those of you that love Bobby & GBV, this is essential. For those of you who don't know them ""Come on, come on, the club is open."""
2,Strictly historical nautical,"I enjoy this type of book and writing style. It is a long, and at times slow, tale of a sailor in the early times of sail. For those who look for this type of story and are perhaps a sailing buff then you will enjoy it. If not well light bed time reading at best."
3,Good but not great,A lot of background knowledge but also not up to date in some categories. Was hoping to get some some specific exercises ideas to help clients come back from an injury related workout pause.
2,Not What I Expected,"Not as complete a treatment of the subject as ""Sports Health - The Complete Book of Athletic Injuries"" by Southmayd and Hoffman that I have used for years with outstanding results."
1,Not interesting,"Instead of maiking offshore investments clearer it makes the veil thiker. Much of the information is misleading. Minimums for offshore investments are much lower (even when speaking of first rated international banks). Assistance is much cheaper than the ""Starting as little as U$D 2.500,-"""
5,Informative,"I found the book to be well written and informative. The subject matter is covered thoroughly and is well organized. The authors are well versed in the offshore industry and present their knowledge in an easy to read format. This book is a ""must read"" for anyone interested in doing business offshore."
2,Estimating Electrical Construction,This book from an estimating standpoint reads like a text book without any substance. The author talks about estimating but does not show any practicality in the actual execution of electrical estimating. He does provide an example but if you have done any type of electrical estimating before you will find it not useful or expounding.
3,Good information but somewhat outdated,"I was really looking for specific information like how long it should take to install an outlet, wire a house, etc. The author gave information how to collect your own data from experience. It was geared toward new construction."
5,Brilliant!,"A fantastic performance of Blue Monk, and a fantastic Epistrophy. This is the performance of Epistrophy whose film footage was used in Ken Burns' Jazz - the one where Monk plays apparently mainly with his thumbs!The Japanese crowd is very silent for a jazz audience."
5,EXCELLENT book Christmas collectibles!,HIGHLY recommend this book for novice and serious collectors of Christmas ornaments. Excellent historical background on every type of ornament and great pictures!
2,Best book anywhere on Asset Protection,This is without a doubt the most comprehensive and interesting book ever written on asset protection. Mr. Reed's personal story involving fighting the Federal government and unethical lawyers is riveting. As a former collection attorney for over fifteen years he knows what he's talking about.
3,Entertaining but Simplistic,"I enjoy reading books about and by the various true beleivers, charlatans, fraudsters and con men who populate the offshore world.Bill Reed was a the notorious promoter of the Asset Protection Group who sold legal Asset Protection schemes to gullible Americans dreaming for the the off shore privacy (and tax avoidance) enjoyed by the top .01%.Bill's book tells us a few things about how assets can be hidden, but fails to really acknowledge that the protection schemes he is shilling for are only effective if you lie to the IRS; and if you get caught, you can end up like Bill, convicted, unemployed and without the assets you thought you sheltered.Any way if you enjoy a breezy romp through the world of asset protection, it's worth reading, but it not a very substantial contribution to the literature."
3,Interesting background info only,"A nice introduction to extreme asset protection techniques as a sales pitch to the reader to employ the author's services. Nothing wrong with that, and I enjoyed reading the book, though it is full of off-topic information including a grossly incorrect statement about the economic base of Singapore. The author does a great job of citing rare cases where the US government bullies people and takes their money; interesting, but for most of us I would guess not exactly helpful in our situation. I am still looking for a good practical guide that explains how to do things without the employment of a lawyer."
4,Another Great Lisa Kleypas Story,"This story picks up about 10 years after ""When Strangers Marry."" The first book covers the love story between Maximilien Vallerand and Lysette. That book allows you some helpful insight into Max's children,Philipe and Justin Vallerand's lives. ""Only With Your Love"" is all about Philipe and Justin's lives as men and their search for meaning. Really enjoyable to see your favorite characters from the first book return with bigger roles!"
1,One star because there's nothing less,"I usually enjoy Lisa Kleypas's books, and that's why I wanted to read this one. Thank goodness I checked it out of the library instead of buying it. I was disgusted. I couldn't even finish it.When Celia and Justine first met, he was abusive. And she was spineless. And then he raped her.I don't think I'm alone in saying that rape and romance are completely incompatable. How insulting this must be to women who have been raped!!"
3,The book isn't one of her better books,"The beginning, Of the book was good but towards the end of the story Celia got on my nerves she was spineless .To be honest I couldn't. Wait till the end to be over....."
1,Rape is rape and it is NOT enjoyed!,"The hero rapes the heroine early on in this story... rapes his sister-in-law... KNOWINGLY!! With his brother only dead for 3 days... and knowing that SHE had to witness his murder! And the author has the gall to have the heroine ENJOY the rape and want for more? NOT A CHANCE!! Maybe a callous, insensitive brute would do such a thing... but a woman would NOT enjoy it and beg for more, certainly not one who just lost her husband! I've enjoyed Kleypas' novels in the past, but if this is going to be her future, this will be the last one I read. This entire book was written in VERY POOR TASTE!!"
2,NOT her best book!,"Ok, I LOVE Lisa Kleypas, and there are very few of her books that I dislike, but this is one of them. I really hoped for more with Justin and Phillipe's story. I did like parts of it, like when Justin was wounded and Celia took care of him, even though he treated her badly. The story just seemed to be too much of a stockholm syndrome story for me, and Celia seemed too vulnerable as the heroine. Granted, she had been through alot, but there is something a little to icky about the whole concept of the story. But that is probably just me."
2,A little disturbing,"I generally love Kleypas's ability to create faceted, interesting lead characters whose lives intersect in an original story. This book, however, is a bit troublesome. Celia and Justin, the main characters, come together in a first sexual experience that can only be termed ""rape."" Celia repeatedly says ""No,"" though with decreasing fervor as Justin persists. Kleypas writes it delicately-- as delicately as possible given the forced nature of the interaction-- but it is still upsetting to read."
2,Not Up to Snuff for Lisa Kleypas,"I couldn't get into this book at all because not only was it somewhat predictable, I did not like the characters. The heroine, Celia, seemed spoiled, sheltered and overall boring. There was nothing special about her and I didn't like her. Also, this book read too much like so many other romance novels where the guy is a complete jerk and womanizer at the beginning only to turn into a sensitive one-woman man at the end of the book. Lisa Kleypas can do better than this. I know it. Her story of Dreaming of You with Sara Fielding and Derek Craven was, by far, one of the best books I have ever read. I only wish we could have another Derek Craven for our hero."
3,Early Kleypas,"Written in 1992, when many historical romance books were still categorized as ""Bodice Rippers"", Only With Your Love deals with violence and rape in a romantic setting. There is nothing romantic about rape and for many current readers of romance novels, myself included, romanticizing the act is distasteful. Why these type of books were so successful is mind boggling. Perhaps it was because of the sex which, I believe, was not to be found in many other romance book sub-genres at the time.All distasteful subject matter aside, this is a well written book. The main characters are well drawn, the plot moves along with adventure and hot sex (consensual). The secondary characters are also well defined. There are a few surprises that keep the pages turning. All Pirates are not romanticized and there is a definite feeling of the realities of pirate life.I am a huge Kleypas fan and although this will never be a favorite, I still admire her ability to write a page turning book."
3,"Recommended, with reservation","In many ways, this is a lovely story and sequel to Kleypas' dynamite book, Only In Your Arms. However, there is one major drawback to this story that can't be overlooked and that is Celia, the heroine. She is inconsistent, contradictory, spineless, cold, indifferent and without charm or joy. I can find no logical reason for the very robust and vibrant Justin to be attracted to her in either love or lust. That said, the story is interesting and well-written and I did enjoy revising Max and Lysette.While I can't give an unqualified thumbs-up, the passion is certainly first rate and I can say that most readers will not be overly disappointed. Some may even enjoy the book very much, depending on how they feel about Celia."
5,Lisa Kleypas' best by far,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This is Lisa Kleypas' best book by far. It also has one of the hottest love scenes I've ever read.French-born Celia is a new bride on a voyage to her husband Philippe's home in New Orleans when her ship is attacked by pirates and Philippe is killed. She is taken to an island where a privateer called Griffin wins her in a fight.Griffin takes her through the bayou, seduces her against her will, and delivers her safely to the home of the Vallerands, her husband's family. There she learns that Griffin (whom she hates) is also connected to this family. When he is injured by the same pirate that killed her husband, Griffin is brought to the Vallerand home and Celia is forced to deal with him in close quarters."
3,"Great potential, but fails to follow through","This was a book that hooked me from page one. It was definitely a page-turner. I was confused by some of the details, though, and disappointed by the ending. It's a literary episode of ""The X-Files,"" which leaves the reader with more questions than they started with. Still a fairly good suspense read despite the flaws."
2,a new age muddle,"T J MacGregor is a good writer-- it's too bad she didn't have a plot to match her writing. The plot, such as it is, has to do with Fortean phenomena (people vanishing into thin air, strange animal behavior, yadayadayada) which is somehow related to Man messing with the Environment. It all ends in a fuzzy feel-good New Age pep rally involving dolphins and flutes. If you want to read a (somewhat) better novel on this theme, check out Wilson Tucker's Ice and Iron. Or better yet, read Charles Fort's Book of the Damned, Lo!, Wild Talents, and New Lands."
5,Exhilarating,"There is so much action, you just can't put it down. This is the third book I've read by T.J. MacGregor and she hasn't disappointed me yet. Her characters are unique, her plot frightening - a combination that created an excellent book."
5,Much Better than Average,"This is one of the Lifeguide Bible Studies, which is generally a good small group study series. My former Sunday School class liked the Lifeguide format and consequently used many of the guides. So I have first-hand experience, in an actual classroom setting, using many of the books in this series.I say all that to say this: This particular guide is the best, in my opinion, in this series. There are a couple of reasons for that. Some of the questions in these guides tend to be more subjectively focused on how you might feel about a particular passage or statement. The questions in this guide are more objectively focused on the actual text. The other reason is because the guide closely follows Stott's full-length book on this passage, which is also excellent (but that's another review).All of that makes this a much better than average small group study guide."
1,This book is horrible,Chances are you are not buying this book for your home organic lab. You probably are buying this for a class. I feel sorry for you.
3,"Fast shipping speed, but this book lacks in so many ways","Book came on time, which is the good part. Anything else ... not so hot. This book hardly explains anything. Doing all of the experiments felt nothing more than doing repetitive laboratory techniques over and over again. Didn't really learn anything ... sad."
4,Great Album,Great as A tribe called quest and black eye peas first album. This album is very relaxed and the beats and flows are tight! It really is only one rapper though.
5,Well Crafted Work,"Beats, rhymes, and life. Talib and Hi Tek deliver these things like seasoned veterans. Though he has two albums under his belt he still keeps his rhymes and delivery fresher than that of an underground cat...his rhymes are intelligent and witty. And Hi Tek..my god, the man has an uncanny knack for gettin beats that no one else could think of..I've never heard beats like this...no one else is better than Dj Premier or The Rza. This album proves that Kwelli can hold it down without the incredible Mos Def and Hi Tek has an incredible career ahead of him."
5,Why don't you own this?,"Seriously. Buy this album. If you don't own this album, you're not a true head. Kweli manages to cover a very broad range of topics here, and for a rapper nowadays that's not a very common occurence. If you felt Common on his latest or Mos Def on Black on Both Sides, you will love this album. Bar none, with the exception of Like Water for Chocolate, this is the best album this year. Period."
3,it's cool...,"talib used to be my favorite mc...this album though has no replay value.practically no topics and when he does have a topic (beside the hidden track ""for women"") their corny ex:""love language.""it's still a cool car cd though-nice beats and talib's flow is cool."

5,A Very Solid Album,"The first track i ever heard of this dynamic duo was ""Eternalists"" which blew me away. I knew then i had to have more of this Talib Kweli & Hi-Tek. So i bought the album and never regretted a moment of every listen. Some tracks are not for everyone but for the most part...DOPE!!! Support underground hip hop and buy this NOW!!"
5,Is Hip Hop Dead?,"It's ultimately rare that a hip hop album this good comes out this late in the game. There should be no explaination involved for this cd. If you are a real hip hop head, or just love hip hop, then you need to have this album in your collection. A truely great collection of beats and lyrics that will stay in your radio and mind forever. Classic hip hop."
5,You're not living if you don't hear this album,"What can I say about this album that it can't say for itself? The first song that I heard was For Women (GREAT!!!). It was playing on a local college station and I almost ran off the road 'cause I got caught in a trance. That song is hypnotic. This album is deep. The beats, the lyrics, the production, everything!!! It's been in my CD player for 2 weeks. I discover something new everytime I listen to it. Long live Talib. I hope to God he puts out more *&#$ like this. Food wouldn't bethe only essential thing that I need to live. WORD!"
5,5 MIC MC,"Talib Kweli and DJ Hitek yet again amaze me with their new album Traing of thought. The beats go from mellow,to jazzy,old shool and everywhere else. Almost all of Hitek's beats were masterpeices combined with Kweli's style and flow it made the album complete. I especially like the tracks ""Too Late"", ""The Blast"", ""African Dream"", ""Memories Live"", and ""Eternalist""(Not to mention just about every other track. Much Respect for Reflection Eternal."
5,kweli I know how you feeeeel .......,"""mos def and talib kweli are blackstar"" is considered a classic, so where do you go next, this is the question for one of hip-hop's up and coming prime lyricists? a tricky question to answer unless you're talib kweli - the next step is simple: release an album with your long time friend and collaborator (who also happens to be one of the best djs on the right coast coast) and produce the finest hip-hop album the people have heard in the last 15 years. combine fine beats that JD would be more than proud of and add kweli's relative, thought provoking, intellegent, hip-hopcentric lyrics and you'll be left asking the 2 questions - ""why have i not heard this album sooner?"" and ""when is the next album soming out?"" You're guess is as good as mine ......"
5,This is the BANG!!!,"With Kweli's ever-clear delivery and razor sharp punchlines, and Hi-Tek's steady, infectious beats, this is a perfect blend of Brooklyn and Cincinatti. This is definitely a must have effort from the man whose name is in the middle of e-quali-ty."
5,"Excellent, classic","This is a classic hip-hop album. Every hip-hop fan should pick this up. Kweli spits excellent rhymes while Hi-Tek lays down some terrific beats. Some of the top tracks are Move Somethin, The Blast, Too Late, Down for the Count, Ghetto Afterlife, Love Language, Soul Rebels, Externalists, and Good Mourning. Kweli's lyrics have a message behind them, but don't come off as ""preachy"". There are also some good guest spots by De La Soul, Mos Def, Res, Rah Digga, Xzibit, Kool G Rap, and Les Nubians, among others. There really isn't much I can add to the previous reviews except to say this is an excellent album which will become a hip-hop classic. If you are a real rap fan, pick this album up!!"
5,A classic,"Talib KWeli in my opinion surpassed Mos Def for having the best Rawkus album ever put out. KWeli and the phenomenal Dj Hi Tek have created one of the greatest hip hop cd's of all time. Kweli's emcee skills are unmatched and Hi Tek's production is of the same calibar of RZA's on the 36 Chambers. Buy this cd if you are a fan of the underground or Rawkus, you won't be dissapointed."
5,Work of Art,"Wow, this has to be in the top ten hip hop albums of all time. Everything is great about it. Hi Tek produces some amazing songs on here, I really don't think I skip any songs when I play. And what's great about this album is the versatility that Hi Tek shows, without sounding commercial. I mean, move something is a head nodder, but something I've never heard before from Tek. then you got the classic good morning, that was so smooth, you know it's something only Hi Tek can produce. But wait, there's Talib. Man, he comes correct. Spits intricate flows. Nice. I loved seeing Xzibit, De La, Mos Def on the mic. Rah Digga, that's the only complaint. She has the most annoying voice, but hey, she came correct, can't complain too much. Anyways, get this. In the top ten of all time. It's worth every cent."
5,an all time great,"i have been a hip hop fan for a number of years. it all started with warren g and regulators. from there, hip hop became a big part of my life. from my 16 years old to about 19 year old stretch, i was real big into the commercial scene.the train of thought (reflection eternal) was the first non-commercial CD i ever gave a chance (thank God i did). kweli and hi-tek's cd has totally expanded my taste in music to almost strictly undergound style hip-hop as far as hip-hop is concerned. for those of you who are into jazzy-funkish music, check out Talib Kweli's song with Soulive (can't think of name of track but it's hot).needless to say ""Hi-Tek make ya nod ya neck to tha rythm"" and combined with kweli's lyrical skills, which are unbelievable, this CD which i have had now for about 3 years gets as much play now is it did the first week i had it."
4,Representin Hip-Hop!!!,"Talib Kweli, a member of Blackstar has teamed up with Dj Hi-tek to produce a brand new refreshing album. Most hip-hop artists have been branded as commercial hip-hop and its kinda erasing the true meaning of hip-hop. Dont get me wrong I love guys like Jay-Z, Snoop, Ja Rule and DMX but I still love underground hip-hop. Talib Kweli provides a refreshing new sound without talking about diamonds,cars and money. Best tracks are Move Somethin, Africa Dream and Soul Rebels. Dont sleep on this album, its a nice piece to add to anyones hip-hop collection."
1,Toss,"There may be a place for this type of pretentious (stuff). But not in my CD rack there're aint. Education for the nation (...)Blah blah blah. Talib Kweli, if that is his real name, has the most irritating whiny little voice I've heard. He thinks he has a message. Who cares? It guess it's a matter of taste, but I like music, not poetry. If I did want poetry, I'd rather read it myself, not listen to some bland self-rightous git recite it to me. Give me Snoop and Dre any day."
4,nice to have,an adventurous toy that contribute to the child imagination with relation to a movie scenes
5,Awesome Book,Earth Surface Processes by Philip A. Allen is a great book!!! Very useful!!!He does a nice working linking physical processes to sedimentary process. If you are taking Sedimentology at a middle or upper lever you want to take a look of this book.
2,Not as dark as you would think,This book wasn't really what I thought it was going to be like. It was definately more fluffy than I had anticipated. If you want a lighter side of Dark Paganism then by all means this book is for you.
4,"Product great, but part broken...","Hi There,Product works great, but upon receiving the item part of the seat base had fragmented... not sure if it got broke in delivery as it had to come along way down to Trinidad from the US... Other than that i would recommend it... Unfortunately returning the item is not an option for me, but if you live in the US, then i guess if you received a broken one you could return it easily..."
1,TERRIBLE,"My wife and I received this chair as a gift for our baby shower. It is a comfortable chair, but that is where my good thoughts end. Within about 2 weeks of use, the wood started to make creeking noises. Noises so loud that it was annoying to watch television while using the chair. Also, the bearings in the actual gliding mechanism were no longer smooth. We are very frustrated!! Especially when we tried to return the chair. NOBODY GOT BACK TO US. Knowing that mostly these chairs are bought for expecting mothers, you would think that the Shermag company or anyone who sells it would want to BACK it. At this point, I am not sure it is safe enough to use while holding a baby. Don't waste your money. Spend $500 to $600 on a chair at a quality furniture store, it will most likely last a lot longer. REMEMBER.... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!"
1,Hate this chair. Wrong product for the cost,"Bought this chair for my pregnant wife3- 4 months back.First its pretty narrow, my wife can sit, but for me it is very uncomfortable.And now its squeaking and making a lot of noise.For 300$ you can get a way better product than this chair.Also, bought this chair because of the brand: Shermag, but am really really disapointed."
1,Clunky sound and squeaky!,"This chair was fabulous at first, then it started squeaking and making a clunking sound. My baby can't even sleep with this amount of noise. Don't bother with this chair."
5,Sherman Glider with Ottoman in Cherry,My granddaughter is expecting a baby. I wanted her to be comfortable when feeding her baby. This item arrived at her home in good condition and was easy to assemble. She says it it is very comfortable and looks great.
1,NOT THE SAME COLOR AS PICTURED!,"This chair was ordered for us as a gift. We first selected the ""Pecan"" colored chair, but when it arrived, it was very orange in color. We sent it back and ordered the ""Cherry"" color, and by no surprise the chair that arrived was MUCH more red than the chair in the photos. We even went to a local store that carried the exact same chairs and verified that the chairs sent to us did not match the Pecan or Cherry color chairs that were in the store. I work in the woodworking industry and completely understand that color variation is just part of the game, however, these are completely different colors than what is shown in the photos. I presume that the chairs that are being sold by AMAZON are bad color/quality batches that the manufacturer is attempting to dump at a discount. As for quality... it's made in China. Figure it out from there."
2,Picture is deceiving,"I researched hours on this and other websites before making this purchase. Even though I wanted to purchas an espresso finish, reclining rocker/glider, I chose this chair because the padding appeared to be much thicker than any other and the price was reasonable. What a deceiving photo! The bottom pad is only about 2"" thick and the felt-type material looks like it won't withstand more than a year of wear. I am debating whether to send it back."
5,"Great chair, minor issues","The chair is very very comfortable and great quality. Some screws were missing for the cushion of the ottaman. Rather than calling I used 4 of my own screws and fixed the issue. Outside of that, I recommend the product. Amazon did a great job as always."
3,"Product description misleading, not 100% happy","I did a lot of review reading before I settled on this glider. I read on amazon.com that it specifically had a higher back and taller arms (for those taller people like myself). That was my deciding factor as i'm 5'10 and my husband is 6'4. We got the glider and it was a cinch to put together, however I've had it for 3 weeks now and its already creaking every now and then. The cushioning is great, but the seat could be a little wider, its quite narrow and my husband and I are not overweight. So, in a nutshell, this glider is great for smaller people...its comfortable but could be quieter."
2,Loud noises after a couple of months.,"We purchased this rocker over a year and a half ago and still use it. We use it only because it's the only rocker we have and only feel like spending more money on another one. This chair makes a it of noise and probaly has since 3 months of owning it. We have tried to lube it many times but that only last about a day. It knocks, squeaks and makes cracking noises. This chair is not worth the money ! I never write reviews but I felt the need to warn consumers. Bad buy."
3,"Not the best, but it gets the job done","For the ubiquitous nursery glider I did a lot of research. This rocker is like your basic politician, lesser of the available evils. My husband wanted something tall enough for his head to rest back on, so the swivel/armchair gliders [...] I was looking at became a non-option. For the record, my friend has one of these and I love them - all the things that bug my about our glider are fixed with this plush comfy one.This glider is too big for my frame of 5'5"". The seat is too deep and high and the arm rests are too high also. I wish, also, that the microfiber covers were removable and therefore washable. It's in the sort of chintzy style of most items nowadays, unless you pay for a mega upgrade to a piece of furniture that will really last.The plusses are that it's a glider, it's economical, it comes with a footstool (which is a must in my opinion), and it's not forever."
4,"Fast delivery, no issues","Good quality product, shipped and delivered in 7 days which I chose that option. Pretty good quality wood for the price. very comfy. I highly recommend this chair over sitting in others out there. Not wobbly at all. I didn't want to get up. Also has the lock positions."
1,Our glider has a hitch,"Every since we bought this glider it's had a hitch, or a bump in the glide. I've tried adjusting it 3 or 4 times and it doesn't help. Due to that I can count on my hands the amount of times my wife has used it due to that. I'm guessing it's just not well built .... But wasn't that expensive."
4,great but could be wider,I am really enjoying my glider. However I have hips so it seems snug. It is comfortable but a little more space wouldn't hurt. My mom has purchased the same chair in a different color.
2,Came broken and super uncomfortable,"I was very hesitant to buy this glider because of the reviews and I wish I would have went with my gut. I bought this so I could rock and feed my new baby. I am 8 and a half months pregnant and I do have hips and there was just no room to sit in the chair. My legs hit the sides and it just felt small overall. I am only 5'4"" and I was unable to rest my head on the back of the glider because it was too short.On top of that, the seat base was broken. When my husband put the chair together, the wood base was cracked on both sides, right where you sit. UPS picked it up today and it is being returned. Just a waste of time for a chair I also found on Craigslist for $150 cheaper. I ordered a different chair and am now hoping it comes before the baby!"
2,"Great, but bolts came loose....twice","We originally bought this glider in June of 2010 and it was great, but around April 2011 we noticed the bolts at the hinges started getting loose causing the chair to have a hiccup while gliding. Called AMazon, and they quickly sent us a new one. Well, almost a year later the new one is doing the same. It appears to be a design flaw in the chair as it happened twice. Well, we got another refund from Amazon and plan to find a different chair then this.For the record, i'm pretty mechanically inclined. Huge garage full of tools and just couldn't get anything to fix this."
2,"shifted, clicked and squeeked","We had our glider for a year and a half. I am so bummed with this product because the frame work of it is completely horribly made!!! It shifted from side to side at the base almost from the start. My husband attempted multiple times to fix it and couldn't... We even had to WD40 the base becasue the wood was squeeking as it rubbed together. We finally got a new rocker (different brand) before my 2nd child was born. I dont know what took us so long?! I would never recommend this to a friend, EVER!!I will give it some credit for being comfortable and spacous, but that is it!!"
3,OK... but not great,"The chair is well built and made from solid woods. However, there is no recline on this model and the ottoman is quite low. It is OK but not very comfortable. I would rather pay more money for a better chair in retrospect."
3,So So,"Pretty chair, nice fabric, no lower back support.You get what you are paying for. If you put a small pillow on your lower back then the chair is comfortable."
5,A story that lingered in my mind for 35 years,"I read this book as a 3rd or 4th grader and was touched by the story of a prehistoric young boy, his love of a horse, and his ultimate triumph of bringing the horse into history as a partner in human survival."
3,good mouse but some quirks,"this is my first review so i'll keep it brief. I've used this mouse for over a month now. I use it for my home office and when i travel. I'm in cosulting so i travel a lot. I'll list the pros and cons below.Pros:* Great battery life - last me 3-4 days of 9-5 use* Easy to set up* You can work while the rechargeable batteries charge (connected via usb)* Good form factor (small, easy to carry, comes w/ a pouch)Cons:* It goes to sleep even with less than 5 seconds of inactivity. Can be very annoying* On some occasions, i couldn't reconnect with my laptop but haven't figured out the cause yet"
1,"I'm not angry, just don't buy it","Like several others here, I bought this mouse packaged with a new laptop (HP) and didn't check reviews separately. No cord, no receiver to plug in, just the perfect stylish travel mouse, right? Set up was beautifully quick. (I've had no connection issues.) I'm no gamer; don't particularly care about mouse ""performance"" specs. Oh, wait. I'd like it to move the pointer when I touch it. I'd support a battery saver feature, but not a narcolepsy problem. It goes to sleep so fast this will happen virtually every time you have to use it. For the lack of a cord (which we never cared much about until a few years ago), you'll pay the price of delay after delay after delay after delay. Not a good trade off. Don't buy this mouse."
2,Sleep timer kills a great mouse,"This mouse would be my favorite. It's Bluetooth, rechargeable via usb, and has a superb laser.HOWEVER, it goes to sleep after only a few seconds of inactivity (<10 sec). Waking the mouse up takes about 2 seconds. Which makes it completely worthless for normal activity.It's great as long as you keep it moving, just don't stop to type anything."
1,Slow to respond and stops working,"I tried this one since I want something better than a 4 foot wireless mouse but like the 3 or 4 I've tried before there is something about bluetooth that is no good for a mouse. It is slow to respond each time you haven't used it for a few seconds, then it also periodically with no pattern, just stops working and have to get it to reconnect."
3,Decent mouse for the money,"This product differed from the picture shown. Mine came branded by Gateway with the model number AMB0302USZ, but it looks nicer than the picture shown anyway. Battery cover is rather difficult to open. This mouse does take a second to wake up from sleeping if you haven't used it in a minute, which can get annoying. Scroll wheel lights up green to indicate that the battery is charging via the included USB cable. It also momentarily lights up red to indicate that it turned on, or if you change the DPI. Feels sturdy and solid. Decent mouse for the money, but I knocked it down to 3 stars for the waking-up-from-sleep lag.Included in box:1 USB charging cable2 AAA NiMH 700mAh rechargeable batteries1 velvet carrying bag with drawstrings1 mouse1 instruction booklet"
3,It finally self-destructed,"It has been a couple of years (or more) since I bought this item. However it worked. The main drawback of this item is that the bluetooth connection will stop working after a few minutes at idle, and it takes a second or two for it to reconnect to work again. This takes some getting used to since most of the ""mice"" I have used over the years will always respond instantaneously when moved. This one doesn't instantly respond and the result is frustration."
4,Thats Great,Battery life is Ok (about 5 days direct)Size is good medium sizeSender is great and fast
5,Better then the rest of the mouse out there.,"this is the best mouse out there, this mouse has a range of 30 feet between the receiver. It also has a rechargeable cable that you are able to recharge it on the go, this is very important for people on the go. however, the bad thing is that you need to buy a adapter for the computer or now a days some computer come with a bluetooth receiver that is able to pick the frequency of the mouse. perfect for college students,blue-collar workers,and travelers."
1,Just doesn't work..,"I just got this mouse and have been trying to use it with a Macbook Pro. Initially, the mouse would connect via bluetooth - but the cursor would jump all over the screen regardless of whether I was moving the mouse or not. It was effectively unusable. Now, just a few days after receiving the mouse - it won't connect at all. So it's completely unusable. My experience may be different from others - but imo this is totally inexcusable. And a flat-out terrible product. I'll stick to Logitech and Microsoft mice from hereonout."
3,Bluetooth mouse,"I couldn't get it to work. The Amazon source sent a new one in an unopened box and one of the batteries was leaking. Replaced & still wouldn't work.Contacted Targus direct and obtained replacement direct from them under warranty. Took an extra 4 weeks but it works now.Not sure if I like it much. It is a small mouse and doesn't fit the palm. Works well but when restarting computer, you have to install it all over again. Very sensitive laser (no light laser) and very fast. Had to adjust mouse speed in control panel. I will give it a few more weeks but will probably go back to the wireless or wired because you don't have to reconnect every time you re-boot.For a very mobile person I think a wireless plug in, immediately recognized and working WOULD BE THE CHOICE for most people. Won't buy one for the other 2 computers I own."
5,Works for Me,"Despite the many negative reviews about this mouse, I decided to go ahead and get it. I haven't regretted it. I've had it for a few weeks now, and it is working very well. It seem over-sensitive when I first started using it, but I got used to it fairly quickly, and it's great. The ""sleep function"" that everyone complains about isn't really a big deal to me. It takes a split second to wake up most of the time, and I've had that same behavior with other bluetooth mice. The Battery life isn't the greatest, but it's decent, and it's very convenient to have the charging cord when it runs out so that I can continue working while it charges. I used my own higher quality rechargeable batteries from the start, so I don't know what the batteries it came with are like. For anyone that wants a really good bluetooth mouse, I would definitely recommend this one. It's really nice, good size, and easily portable."
1,Poor reliability,"I've owned two of these mice. The first died within a year, so I got a second within the warranty. The second died within two years with regular, but no, and I really mean NO abuse. Targus would not replace the moouse. When it works, it's super. However, as others have said, the build quality is very, very, poor. I cannot recommend this mouse."
1,Pretty disappointing,"I'm not very happy with this mouse.- Very, very laggy. Presumably to improve battery life, it goes to sleep constantly. You're always having to wiggle to wake it up, even after just a few seconds' typing.- Charges batteries slowly, and does not work at all when batteries are dead, even with USB cable plugged in. So you'll leave it on the shelf for a while to find the batteries are dead, then need to plug it in for a long time to get even the minimal charge needed to use it.The one pro is that it's quite precise, and has a precision-enhancement mode with even higher DPI, but that's all for nought since you're having to fight its narcolepsy all the time.Size is just big enough not to fit easily in a tiny part of a bag, but still small enough to be non-ergonomic. The worst of all worlds."
1,"""mini-sleep mode"" is terrible design flaw","Gateway Bluetooth users be warned as well. This very same model mouse is being sold by Gateway (with a black and grey color scheme and a Gateway logo in place of the targus logo) for use with their Bluetooth enabled laptops.Gateway's model number is 7005803R. Targus lists it as AMB0302USZ. But it's the same exact mouse.The ""mini-sleep"" mode design flaw outweighs all the other benefits. especially if you're a gamer. No way you can afford to have to wiggle the mouse to bring it back to life in a heated battle.And even if you're not a gamer, it's just damn annoying. Targus and Gateway offer nothing to help either. No drivers or utilities."
1,Completely dead device.... useless,"My experience was identical to that of David Yutzy. Simply put, the mouse never worked. Not even once. Ironically, like David, I'm about to leave on vacation. Unlike David, I'm not waiting to return this.I called up Targus tech support and while I am impressed with how quickly they took the call, their response was simply that I return it to the point of purchase and obtain a replacement.I have a better idea. I'll return it, get my money back and buy a different product from a different manufacturer. One that actually works. From the look of some of the comments by other users on this product, I may very well have been saved the additional frustration of dealing with short inactivity timeouts.I'll end by copying David Yutzy's last line:Avoid at all costs."
1,I also made the mistake of buying this mouse,"Like a lot of other people on this site I have to give the targus mouse 1 star... I made the mistake of buying it from a store before checking out the reviews on Amazon, and other places.. It seemed great, but the auto-sleep that everyone is talking about just destroys the usefulness of the mouse ( yes it really goes into sleep after 5-7 seconds, people are not joking). I thought I could live with it, but after only 2 days I had to go buy another mouse...I ended up buying the Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse instead, and it works great....Trust me and the others on the site, the delay is very, very annoying.."
1,gets stuck,"I don't know if mine was defective, but if you left it alone for 3 seconds then it would get stuck, or go to sleep, I don't know what was happening, but you would have to move it around for a second to make it start working again. Other than that it seemed like a great mouse, but that defect was so incredibly annoying I returned it and can only give it 1 star."
1,Never got it to work,"I ordered this mouse as it's feature set seemed great! I didn't check the reviews here before ordering (I used some AMEX points) but really wish I would have.From day one, the green light comes on, seemingly with a mind of it's own. I've never been able to get the mouse to get picked up by any of my Macs or Windows laptops, it simple hasn't worked at all.Unfortunately (for me) I went on vacation and by the time i got back, the return period had expired and so basically I have a mouse that doesn't work.Bottom line: Don't buy this mouse, it sucks and has some serious flaws, even though some people here did manage to get it to work. Avoid at all costs."
4,Good mouse but battery life could be better,The mouse was easy to setup. I recommend you go to there site and download the newest drivers and don't use the cd. Only thing I didn't like is that the battery life doesn't seem to last very long. Not sure why it dies so fast even when your not using it. Love that you can use it while the usb is charging it.
2,"Great ergonomics, poor quality, mine had problems right away.","What a shame. I really like the ergonomics of this mouse, but the quality leaves something to be desired. Mine would not charge nor work from batteries at all. It will work when plugged in via USB. Batteries won't charge and using other batteries (which I tested to make sure they were good) did not work either. The battery cover design is a bit of a pain, too, harder than many and I doubt would hold up. I got it cheap, so I won't bother to return, will just throw it in the bag as a 'back-up' mouse. But cannot recommend it as there are many better choices (though more expensive).You may want to consider this alternative which costs a little more, but is of much better quality and works well:Toshiba Bluetooth Laser Mouse (Gloss Black)(Other than the glossy back finish, it's nearly perfect for my uses.)"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This mouse brought nothing but trouble. For one it has terrible battery life, however it's easy enough to plug it into the computer and recharge (you can still use it as it is charging). Also, it disconnects after about 10 seconds of not using it. You have to shake it and it connects in about a second or two. I know that doesn't sound bad, but it gets annoying. My dad got one too. His came as a Gateway mouse (nice, right?) and now appears broken after a month of use. On the up side, it was cheap."
3,it's an OK device,"Overall it's a good device;Not as smooth as wired ones, but maneuverability is goodTends to disconnect and reconnect too easily"
5,Works great,Received a new sealed-in-box mouse. When waking up from sleep the Bluetooth mouse takes about a sec to initialize the radio signal but then it works great.
1,Don't buy this mouse,"Mouse worked fine for about 3 weeks. Now my laptop won't even recognize its signal. I've tried re-installing, changing batteries, etc...but to no avail. My advice is to look elsewhere and stay away form this product. Even when it was working, the charge on the mouse didn't seem to last very long before I had to plug it back in with the usb cable. I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase."
4,Not as bad as adverttised,"I read all the negative reviews before I bought this mouse. After using it for a day or so, I thought the bad reviewers were right. Decided to read the instructions again. I am glad I did. It seems like a few things can foul up a Bluetooth signal. Like, a wireless router, metal surfaces, and metal in laptops, to name a few. Once I took this into consideration the mouse works fine. At home I usually sit a dinning table to use. I just moved chairs to face away from my wireless router and it works great. I do get an occasional disconnect when battery it low and such but, that is normal with any wireless mouse. I also, read reviews for all other Bluetooth mouses I could find and found out the complaints were the same. I love the fact I don't have to plug that stupid adapter into my USB drive anymore like a regular wireless mouse, its great!"
5,My Blu Mouse,This a very easy to use device and does the job that it was meant for. I could'nt ask for a better mouse. small and compact and very useful. i would highly recommend this to anybody looking for a notebook mouse
2,Good value but too many fumes,"I've used this unit for two winters, and while it does a good job for the money, it definately puts out more fumes than other forced air heaters. I haven't compared it to other LP forced air heaters, if there are any, but ones that use diesel/kero burn much cleaner and it's no where close to a catalytic block style heater. If you look down the barell while it's running, it's basically just a giant flame.If you are heating a semi-enclosed area, spend the extra $50US to get the liquid fuel one."
2,Not good for cleaning records,"The wooden base is original and acts as a hidden draw for storing the fluid and spare styli. The fluid is just distilled water and is not anti-static, the felt pad takes ages to dry for a second session of cleaning and in combination with the water does a poor job. Try it if you want 3 needles, but you'll be looking for something else to clean records with."
4,Exactly what it says it is,"I got this for my wife for Christmas this past year, as our original turntable was handed down from her grandmother and was beginning to insist on not working anymore. We entertain quite a bit, have a good collection of vinyls from older artists (Count Basie) to modern (Vampier Weekend, Modest Mouse), and decided we wanted something that would encompass all of our musical tastes. Looks great too.Definitely recommend it. Some reviews have mentioned that the volume doesn't meet their preferences. We have yet to ramp this thing up to full-blast, and we're able to hear it across the house."
5,Beautiful singing and arrangements,"Fuentes has a smooth, rich voice and the fusion of jazz and Nueva Cancion in the instrumental music is well done."
2,Tastes disgusting,"This product may be a great supplement, but the taste is purely awful. I used to use another brand made by our natural store chain that was orange flavored and it tasted divine. I was forced to purchase this more expensive product one day when the store brand was sold out. This stuff tastes disgusting. Yes, it tastes like pina colada, but nasty, rotting, fermented pina colada. Ignore the instructions on the bottle to mix it with water and drink it. That just prolongs the suffering. Take it as a shot and chase it with lots of water. It's a much less painful way to get it down and gets it over with a lot faster. Yuck!"
3,Calmag review,"Good stuff, very bad taste. Needs a new flavor the piña colada taste is nasty. The order time was short."
3,Couldn't stand the taste,"This may be a great product but it tastes awful. I was looking for a pill-free calcium supplement. Yes, it takes like pina colada, but it also tastes like chalk. When I first tasted it, I thought it wasn't bad. The first week I took it just fine and wasn't bothered by it. By the second week I was wincing at the thought of taking it every night. By the third week I avoided it several nights in a row and when I did take it had to choke it down. Last night I took it and felt nauseous, not because I think there's anything wrong with the product but my taste buds have had enough of that chalky taste. Today I'm throwing the rest out and ordered some calcium chocolate chews to try instead. It's too bad, if they could get rid of the chalky taste I'm sure I could continue taking it. Also I find that liquid supplements tend to cause a sticky mess in the fridge, unless you wipe off the bottle every time."
2,Tastes bad,"I really wanted to like this stuff, but it's vile no matter what I try to bury the taste in. Kind of like a cross between maalox and children's flavored cough syrup."
1,not so good for some individuals,"I think that probably for most people, this is a fine product but for me I can't handle the chalky taste because I was given so much milk of magnesia as a child, my system does not handle magnesium well as it gives me a stomach ache and diarrhea. Most capsules only have Vit D with the calcium which I think is all that is needed for the system to absorb the calcium."
4,good source of minerals,"Liquid form is a great way to get your minerals and vitamins. This is a good one because you not only get the calcium, magnesium, and zinc in a bioavailable form, but you also get the trace minerals from sea water added into it. The taste is good if you like the flavor of pina colada, but is a bit chalky-tasting, yet sweet. I take my vitamins in the morning, and my minerals at night. This company makes other great mineral products as well as liquid vitamins."
3,Sugar!,"I do not understand where the 7 grams of sugar per serving comes from! The overly-sweet taste is overwhelming. I would rather have other treats with the same amount of sugar. No sugars appear in the ingredients list. If it's fruit sugar, I may reconsider my rating."
1,Lasted Less then a Week in Light work,I will be contacting carhartt on these gloves at first I was very impressed after 4 days of work on a bridge deck they completely fell apart I could se if I was abusing them my work included carrying 2x4's Stripping concrete forms and folding concrete Blankets Nothing harsh or out of the ordinary! Very bad investment I had a cheap pair of gloves last me almost a year before they looked like these gloves in 4 days!
2,not satisfied at all,"first impression: fitted well, felt very comfortable on hand but there went a big BUTs: it's not what we expected to receive. we expected gloves to be more tear proof but after a few times wearing them, the stitches began to start. isn't it supposed to be more durable for work? though we did not use it for work, just put them on in a cold day for driving the car. even if it's for fashion still not very pleasant to deal with some sticking out strings out of gloves. very disappointed (unlike other Carhartt products we purchised)."
3,fluffy,"a lot of fluff, but it's exactly what's to be expected.you can only get about 1-2 pages of info on any one birthday.. which is more than enough to ""break the ice"" when someone comes over and sees itfun, but slightly disappointing"
3,Great performance by Huffman,"This is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it even got made. It's really a far-fetched little tale, but Felicity Huffman does a bang-up job in the lead role, and you get to see a lot of pretty scenery along the way as Bree and Toby traverse the USA. The critics generally liked it because it's ""different,"" but that's not always a good thing. I'm glad I didn't spend the time and money to see it in a theater, but as a Friday Night renter on DVD, it held my interest."
3,"DUNCAN TUCKER, OPUS 1","*** 2005. Written and directed by Duncan Tucker. Two Academy awards nominations (song and actress) and Golden Globe earned by Felicity Huffman. A transsexual, on the verge of being operated must drive across the U.S. in the company of his son, a juvenile delinquent. Clichés and clichés. The redeeming and edifying road movie is a common theme of American cinema; just think, for instance about Don Siegel'sTwo Mules For Sister Sara(cowboy and nun) or Barry Levinson'sRain Man (Special Edition)(yuppie and autistic person). The only original element of TRANSAMERICA is the decision to ask an actress to play a male would-be transsexual. Apart from that, nothing new under the sun. Already forgotten."
1,Depressing!,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I really did not at all enjoy this movie. I was expecting something similar to Kinky Boots- a funny story with a message underneath, but this just made me depressed! The acting was great, but I really did not find this to be funny in any way. Bree's story was touching, but I found little growth in her son (Toby's)story. I felt dirty by the end of the movie (not by the TG issue- by Toby's life within the sex industry).Basically, this movie had great acting and the stars deserve praise for this. But this is by no means a comedy in my book. By the end of the movie I felt depressed."
3,Short Judgment,"Pedestrian drama with touches of ""burekas"" comedy (low-brow comedies for low-class Israelis done during the seventies and eighties). Felicity Hoffman plays a woman in the body of a man changing into a woman. She plays it good. That's it."
3,Mixed feelings,"This was a touching movie (although it is not altogether realistic). And Felicity Huffman did a nice job. What bothers me is that her voice coach, Andrea James, has been a malevolent presence in the transsexual community. For example, she attacked Michael Bailey, and even posted pictures of his little children with obscene captions by them. (Did Huffman know this when she hired James, I wonder?) I suppose it is some kind of cultural achievement to teach a woman to sound like a man trying to sound like a woman. But it disturbs me to see all this positive press about a creep."
3,Well intentioned.,"Transamerica was a well intentioned movie that attempts to portray some of the family dynamics of a person who is making this radical change in their life.I liked the part of the story line where the main character, Bree, learns about herself as a parent. This was interesting and touching. The acting performance by Felicity Huffman was not what I expected after hearing about the Oscar nomination. In my opinion she relied too much on attempting to make her voice deeper. This made her delivery flat and lacking in emotion which is not the case with real transgendered people. Some aspects of the plot seemed contrived and, at times, unlikely. For example it would be more interesting if Bree's family were normal instead of troubled--maybe a little stereotypical?Overall, worth a glance if you have not seen other fine films about the transgender experience."
4,Amazing,"Amazing performance. Felicity deserved the Oscar. TRANSAMERICA is a wonderful low budget film that doesnt try too hard to be likeable. It comes across honest and comedic yet very touching. One of the great films last year. I wasnt sure what to quite expect when I sat down to watch it but within minutes found myself glued to the screen. Terrific. If you love character study films, this is one for you!"
4,transamerica,"the movie is good and thought provoking. very moving and funny in parts.well deserving of its 2 oscar nominations.would like to mention the song "" travelling throu"", one word to discribe it is awesome!!!!!! one of the most inspirational songs i have heard for a long time.the theme song fits the message of the movie really well. listen to the song and you will see what i mean.dolly parton wrote the sond and recorded it.parton and huffman deserved the reconition that they received. well done!!!!"
3,The acting is powerfull and the story is nice,"I enjoyed this film for it's real acting and how it show the real emotion of the actors. Felicity Huffman should of won besr actress oscar but she did not but she won amny other awards and one day she will win. The acting is top notch from everyone from main charactors to supporting roles. The direction is good. the story is good but it drags at times, it has dsome funny moments that are good. Overall the film is good for it's realnice of humans."
3,Through someone elses eyes.,I needed a different view to understand a friends perspective. I needed to see through his eyes. This film helped.
3,I did NOT find this funny...,"Why do I say that? Well, if you read the cover of the dvd, one critic wrote that it is a very funny movie. I don't even believe this movie was meant to be funny. Okay, so this isn't exactly the type of movie that I would usually love, that's why only 3 stars. HOWEVER, the acting is superb. I mean, Felicity Huffman totally deserved the Oscar nomination. She was very believable in it. For that reason alone, I would say yes to this movie. :)"
3,Good but not great,I love the plot but the acting leaves much to be desired. However I still highly recommend viewing this movie as it does give some wonderful insight into the struggles of being transgender.
5,Transamerica,I am glad I purchased this online. I saved money. It was a good price and came quick. All around good experience!
3,"Content 4, Digital Format 2","The content of this e-book is interesting and useful to anyone who is looking for critical thoughts about the plays of Plautus and Terence. As with many older academic works, however, the digital formatting is challenging at best and can be truly annoying. There is no real Table of Contents, but paging back from the beginning one can find a list of main sections which are hyperlinked. Bookmark that page! Many of the footnotes for the introduction are hyperlinked, which is both unusual (unfortunately notes are rarely linked to text) and helpful. All apostrophes and quotation marks look like ??? on my Kindle. This is an irritating formatting problem, but it can be ignored once one gets used to it. Really, for great books long out of print, proper digital formatting for effective text access *must* become a priority for publishers. Period."
3,i don't agree with you...,"first and foremost this is not massive attack new album but a compilation put together by an early member of the band.This compilation includes material by pre-massive attack fame band the wild bunch(which includes as an extra member along the original massive attack line up,producer nellee hooper who later went on collaborating with bjork,soul 2soul,madonna...)and music from bands and dj's who inspired the massive atack sound.this album is just a glimpse at how the band started in bristol u.k in the mid eightie's.Massive attack new album""100 th window"" is being released in february and i have listen to it and it 's really really good,sounds like ""mezzanine"" but even more darker and less ""new wavy"" and more into jamacan dub kind of vibe with vocals by horace andy,sinead o'connor,amongst others!"
1,Remixed old music is still old music,"I love Massive Attack. The somber-yet-uplifting sounds of Mezzanine, the vocalizations of Protection and the all-around likeability of Blue Lines; there are few bands that have successfully delivered innovative music album after album. This is why the much anticipated release of Original Underground was such a disappointment. I expected to be won over again by their newest sound, enthralled by their latest discovery of previously unknown musical genius. Granted, that's a lot to ask of any band, but there's nothing new on Original Underground. I did enjoy the brief flashback to my backspinning-on-cardboard days, but what I've always liked about Massive Attack was their ability to make music that's ahead of its time, the newest-latest music for the modern world and all that. If retro old school 80's hip hop is what your after, maybe this is the album for you. Otherwise stick with the old stuff."
3,Alpha-Hydroxy Peel Works For Me!,"This formula contains a concentration of the active ingredient in Alpha-Hydroxy products, which you simply apply, wait, and rinse. I have been using it about twice a week for several weeks now. Though the changes have not been dramatic, I have noticed an increase in my skin's overall tone, and am finding that some pigmentation is beginning to lessen: it might be too soon to see major fading of skin discoloration, but I have noticed the improvement, so I would recommend this product. If you're looking for the 'magic bullet', this isn't it. But it is a good addition to your current cosmetic regimen."
1,NOTHING,This stuff sucks. It didn't help me with anything. It caused my skin to be very oily and break out.
5,A truly entertaining and revealing book,"This book transports the reader into the era of pre-Robinson, Mexican baseball and beautifully portrays baseball legends, writers, and dreamers."
4,Zero studio effort features great songs,"Highlights of the album: Pits of Thunder, Van Morrison's Friday's Child, Sun, Sun, Sun, and Kissin' The Boo Boo, which captures some of the band's legendary energy on instrumental material. Songs are mostly by Robert Hunter, who wrote often with Jerry Garcia, and Steve Kimock, now touring with The Other Ones, featuring members of the Grateful Dead."
4,"Yes, they really are as good as the rumors you've heard","I had read rave reviews about these guys for a long time but never heard their music -- they don't get to the midwest much. The CD confirms that these guys can really play. Tight instrumentation and lyrics you actually want to listen to, courtesy of wordsmith extraordinaire Robert Hunter. Best of all is the guitar work of Steve Kimock. He is a gifted player and shows it on nearly every song. I can only imagine the live show these guys put on. Buy the CD, you wont be disappointed."
1,awful drek,Who cares if Robert Hunter is associated with these guys. Their 1995 album was decent. This album is like Journey doing power ballads. SKIP THIS ONE!
1,Part of some study guide,"This is a workbook that's supposed to complement the actual book, which I can't find on Amazon. Don't buy it unless you're a college student and it's required by your class curriculum."
3,Good charge but remains loose in the battery compartment,"The batery is ok but when you placed inside the battery compartment of an Olympus e-620 remains a little bit loose.. Compared with the size of the original one, this battery height is smaller"
5,animation at its best,"Back in 95 I watched this show alot and I played the earthworm jim games on snes, I want to get the first ewj game on gameboy advanced. This video is awsome very funny espeacially on the sword of rithiousness episode when the sword says fear me ....... old tree. and the tree gets up from its soil and runs away terrified.[I was laughing so much when I seen that part]. If you like funny cartoons this is one of the best check it out."
5,Real great purchase,"Used to lift logs onto my saw and remove logs from the woods. Work great, really dig into the logs and hold tight"
1,What a disappointment.,I was very disappointed in this video. Not at all what I expected and WHY doesn't someone help this guy learn to speak the English language.
1,From what I heard,"It seems all the DVD reviews of this IAN Wright, Globe Trekker has mostly been negative. Mainly because the lack of his understanding of the cultures and being a stupid Brit Tourist. Thats funny. I will never buy none of his DVD... but I will keep reading reviews on him... dude must be a totally idiot.. from the way most of the reviews describe him..lol... someone should tell him."
1,Don't waste your money,"Summer 2006 we were planning a trip to Thailand and purchased various guide books and DVD's. Globe Trekker Thailand, Malaysia & Laos was a big disappointment. The focus is on the host acting like a stupid tourist not on Thailand. I considered asking for a refund. Don't waste your money. There are much better travel DVD's on Thailand on the market."
1,I agree,"I agree. I just watched this. It was a huge disappointment. I've gotten way more information and seen more videos from the Web than this thing could deliver.Why are the hosts so ditzy and obnoxious? I couldn't believe it when she told the shopkeeper that his watches were crap in that snotty attitude she had. Insulting people like that, regardless of their trade, is not a way to make Americans look like good ambassadors. I was embarrased for him.Then when Ian comes out showing that fat wad of cash??? Hello? Even if it is just for show for the camera, what traveler in their right mind would come hootin and hollerin out of a bike rental shop showing all the money they just exchanged? Are you people serious?Please do not buy this."
1,Trash. Avoid.,"The host Ian Wright is the focus of this show. He has to be one of the most vulgar, stupid TV narrators alive. This was like dum and dumber, except it wasn't funny. A total waste of time."
5,The Principal Pleasure,"The Pleasures of C is book that not only rewards frequent rereadings, but demands them. The poems again and again invoke the great modernist arts of jazz and photography as grand, continuous, integrative conceits. As one explores the work's peculiar synesthetic depths, one finds oneself drawn back and forth from poem to poem, sensing a life's worth of reading, listening, thinking, and feeling condensed in them. One poem in particular haunts, ""A Simple Metaphor."" Where in our time has poetry come so close to the Poundian ideal, ""language charged with meaning to the utmost possible extent,"" so close to fixing life itself in words we can speak?"
4,Wonderful TV,I just got this TV and it is perfect for a family room environment. Big enough for everyone tosee. And the smooth screen prevents annoying glares from close windows. This is great for families who enjoy to watch Tv together!
4,Does NOT fit the Ericsson T18 phone!,"This phone does NOT fit the Ericsson T18 phone, which is a pity, because it's a very nice item. All the squeezing in the world wouldn't get my phone in there."
2,As strong as the weakest link.,"The pouch is very handsome, the magnetic clasp is nifty, if a little bulky. It fits my Nokia 8290 very nicely. Unfortunately, the snap, which is used to secure the pouch in place on your belt, broke after two days of wearing it. This item is going back."
4,GREAT DEBUT ALBUM,"I am reading a lot of negative comments about Sean Kingston's debut CD. I really don't know how old some of you are or what ethnic background you are from, but this type of music is typical for a young West Indian male to make for this day and age. I am of West Indian descent and also twice his age and I think this young man is very talented. He will have a second, third and hopefully a fourth album. I hope he continues to use his West Indian roots and work with his uncle Buju and others like Elephant Man, Beenie, Sean P, Sizzla, Machel Montano, Rupee, Rihanna and all of my Caribbean Bredren and Sistren. GOD BLESS AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MR. SEAN KINGSTON!"
4,Love this CD,"I first heard Sean Kingston because of song ""Beautiful Girl"" but I love this CD - especially the Phil Collins remix song."
4,Good tunes,"I was very skeptical about buying this cd...it's hard for me to go out after hearing one or two songs and buy the CD because most of the time I am disappointed...not the case here. I understand that some people might not think he's voice is ""catchy"" but I think it is very unique...There are only like a few people out there who have the Jamaiccan style music...I think it is a very good cd for his debut."
1,Forget what they told you,The relative success of this CD proves that you do not need talent to be successful.With artists like this the real question is who paved the way for him.
4,Sean Kingston Review,"Very nice album, comes off hard, but mellows out to a nice reggae sound. very nice!"
3,cool...,"this song is really banging here in asia, it's playing everywhere.. it sucks because im sicking tired of the song.."
1,Hopefully this will pass very quickly,"Maybe I'm not being fair, since I haven't heard the whole thing, but when you make a song that is as frighteningly bad as ""Beautiful Girls"", it makes it very difficult to find even a remotely compelling reason to waste my time bothering with the album.The most accurate possible deduction that I can come up with for this is as follows: As far as being able to sing, this guy is the male version of Ashanti. His lyricism on ""Beautiful Girls"" is so pathetic that it makes Weird Al Yankovic seem almost serious, and of course there's the issue of the sample, which is never a good idea in the first place but especially bad here, because there was never a damn thing wrong with ""Stand By Me"" by Ben E. King (who should be having a huge fit every time he hears this). Avoid, don't support, because we don't need guys like this to help shape the future of R&B; (if there even still is such a thing at this point in time)."
1,Ho Hum.,"While the singer does have a few catchy songs, his lack of talent is apparent in the 'canned' songs used to enhance his voice.His faux Jamacian accent is really strained... it made me think he had a speech impediment until I found that he was trying, really hard, to sound Jamacian. Unfortunately, he fails.Not that it takes much musical talent to be a pop star now-a-days, but hearing the main song from this album, I had expected more from the rest of the album. I'm left a disappointed listener... but not too disappointed since I listened to it on Real Rhapsody (music subscription service), so I'm not out $15.00!"
2,No Real Talent,"Sean Kingston came out just about 5 monthes ago and ever since he has been topping charts all over the place, he has my neighborhood singin it all the time, and sold over a million ringtones. But the fact is that this guy has barely any musical talent. A lot of him think his cool or whatever but he is not. He may be jamaican but so what, not all jamaican reggae artists are good. This guy has no vocal range at all, he is fat n fugly as hell, its really sickenin to see people that think this is real music. The only thing that this guy has is catchy annoying slogans. And the fact that this guy is related to the great Bob Marley is truly unbelievable, u have a legend like Bob Marley and u have this guy.......its obvious that not only hip hop is falling but also reggae music. a lot of people are goin to hate me but f887 ya'll, this is the truth."
5,I LOVE this product!,"Only problem, it's like the last one I bought, dropped and broke. I actually had the first one a lot longer than I had this one. It was not able to survive my klutziness for longer than three days this time! But before I broke either of them, they are perfect for making shaken drinks for small gatherings. It has just the right measure for two drinks, the makings on the glass are bold enough that even I can read them and when you're not mixing drinks with them, you can use the top of the glass to make a perfect cut in your bread for a toad in the hole. I am now looking for the same size mixing glass made of a more durable material so that it can survive my butterfingers. If you're not prone to dropping glass wear, this is a great measuring glass!"
1,Markings on 2 of them wore off in 1 month,"I bought 2 of these and after 1 month of use every 1-2 days (to measure a small amount of milk), many of the markings are gone, on both of them. They have either been just rinsed out or hand washed with a nonabrasive sponge. When I ordered them, I expected to get the measuring glass in the Amazon item picture (as I already own that one and it's held up for years), but these did not have the same Gemco name or logo as shown in the picture, and they were slightly shorter. I've just sent a note to the seller requesting a refund. Update Aug 20: After sending photos to the seller and following up, I got a full refund."
1,Markings Definitely Fall Off,"THe markings fell off after one week of daily use. I bought this to replace a pyrex measuring glass that I dropped. I had had that one for over two years with no change in the markings. Buyer beware, and go with a better known manufacturer like Anchor Hocking and/or Pyrex. Not this no name brand."
4,Good Model,"The Illustrations need some work. They are a bit vague in spots. Mostly in the placing of some the wiring. And you will need a Dremel Tool to shorten a few of the screws to make a tight fit. On the whole it is an excellent display model and easily constructed. One of the best I've seen. The prepainted parts are very nice, especially if your not into or adept at painting models. On the whole I was very happy in how it came out."
5,wonderful,very happy with the system it is improving the wrinkles and lines in my face and it leaves my skin soft and radiant. Highly recommend
5,Excellant products,"This is a good buy when you purchase the three products together. I use all three of them, so really is a saving's for me. Neutrogena makes good product's, so will continue to use them."
2,"Not a fan, will discontinue delivery","I have oily acne prone skin and I started getting fine lines around my eyes. I usually like Neutrogena products but this one is a dud. First, it doesn't lather at all. I've had an issue w/ it actually sliding off my hands a few times since it doesn't lather. Second it has a weird smell. Third it doesn't work. I'm delusional in thinking that a few months using the product will suddenly make my fine lines disappear but there is no difference at all. Plus my skin is still oily and I've broken out several times since I started using it. After this bottle I'm done. I'm in the market for something new."
3,Limpiador,Es un buen producto. Lo que no me gusta es que a causa del Retinol no se puede usar por las mañanas para no exponerse al sol. No lo vuelvo a comprar.
4,good product,"Nice face cleaner, not too harsh but has some added benefit of anti-wrinkle and anti-blemish. Lasts a long time because only a dime size amount cleans your whole face!"
1,lame,I've used it for 2 months. Does not work. Maybe because I am a guy. I don't know. For me it is just a garbage.
2,Break Outs,"The only part of this kit that I like is the under eye cream. I use Neutrogena products and normally love them but the anti-wrinkle moisturizer or whatever clogged my pours and caused me to break out only in the places I used it. It does warn of this on the package and claims that if you keep using it the break outs will go away - after a month, I really don't think they're going to. I didn't notice any change in wrinkles - I'm only 33 so it's not like I have a ton but I swear the one I have which concerns me (around my mouth) actually got worse. I also agree with others who have said that the face wash smells bad. It reminds me of plastic or some other synthetic substance, and I am not sensitive to smells."
1,worst face product EVER,"Worst face product EVER.I was looking for something with salicylic acid to fight blemishes, but that was not for teenagers and therefore too drying. I prefer not to use products with sodium laurel sulfate, either. I'm a mid life person, but still fight the occasional whitehead and greasy face mid-day.This product was AWFUL. It made me break out in huge pustules, and also made my face very tight and dry at the same time. It's taken almost a month without it to get back to normal.And folks weren't kidding about the creepy smell. Closest I could describe it is like hospital smell, or purell. Not clean, just creepy.Can't imagine who this product is good for.Ick. I didn't even try to give it away, just threw it out."
2,Shipping,I've used this product before and I like it. I placed my order while I was traveling so it would be home when I returned. This packing/shipping was BAD. My items were thrown into the box with no wrapping or anything. The top of the item opened and the product has come out and was all over my other items. Not sure how much I lost but it was a mess. I didn't have time to do the return thing but I will not order this way again. Next time I'll just go to Target.
3,Ulysses s Grant,Thought a little vague could of been better on the history of the battles and the people who supported him
5,Must have,"If you can only own a single Janis Ian product, this is the one. This powerful live performance was shot in an intimate cafe setting in Pittsburgh's Southside. Janis is both intimate and commanding throughout the show as she works her way through back catalog and newer material. The DVD has quite a few extras as well, including a two part interview with Ms. Ian that alone is worth the cost of the DVD.The DVD includes what i consider to be the definitive version of 'Take No Prisoners' as well as the haunting and touching 'I hear you sing again' . A must have for fans of Ms. Ian."
1,Nav system shows no transducer connected,"I installed a 788Ci on my 27"" CC with the same transducer and it worked great ( I used it once ). After installing the unit I upgraded to a 29"" Cat and moved the 788CI to the new boat and ordered a new transducer to replace the first since it was attached to the old boat. For some reason the 788Ci will not recognize this new transducer. We tried a different model Huminbird transducer and it was recognized with no problem."
4,You should buy this CD!,"Guaranteed smiles. The songs here range from hilarious (King of the Rollerama, Cheerleader) to inspired introspection (Marrow of my Bone). Deirdres funky middle-eastern flavored tribute to a Belly Dancing teacher (Introduction to Belly Dancing)is one of the more beautiful songs I have ever heard. The title track is another touching song about making up the distance put between friends by time and circumstance. If your a Springsteen fan you'll love ""Fishlands"", a clever Bruce inspired tune about life in a bayfront fishbowl. You could say single women will find the most to relate to in Deirdres lyrics, but you don't have to be a single woman to appreciate her extraordinary talent as a singer/songwriter. Enjoy!"
5,NDA alum,Hi! I am a 9th grader at a school in Villanova PA. Deirdre graduated from my school in 1985 and she played about 7 songs for us the other day. I was so excited. I listen to her over and over again. This is a great investment. She is funny and witty.
2,Disapointing,"I got this CD as a Xmas gift and thought some of the songs were funny the first time I played it. The second time, though, there's nothing much to sustain continued interest. If I ever play it a third time, it won't be any time soon."
5,hysterical,This CD was a hoot -- it was given to us as a gift and we laughed all the way through it. Loved it!!
5,A different holiday twist from Lorie!,"To me, this christmas album has a different sound to it than some of Lorie Line's other works. But it's my favorite, it has a lighter feel to it. She deserves definate recognition for all of her good work."
4,gives me chicken skin,"I absolutely love Kahea U'ilani, it almost breaks my heart to listen. Very powerful. And of course Sleepwalker makes me miss the islands."
3,Not as good as their first or 3rd release,"I really like about 4 songs on this c.d. The other Hapa c.d's I like most all the songs. This c.d. either has too much chanting or the songs have a ""pop"" sound to them, such as beach boy's on Waikiki with guest artist Don Ho."
1,"""HAPA"" is the only CD worth buying","HAPA, this duo's first release, was fantastic. I heard them several times live after that album came out and loved them. But since then, I've come to the conclusion that this is a group that really only had one good album in them. I made the mistake of buying this album and it is just awful. Get HAPA -- it's a wonderful album whose beauty for whatever reason they just have never been able to really match. And for the record, their cover of ""In the Name of Love"" is one of he worst covers ever -- it's embarrassing. Summary: skip this album, buy HAPA."
3,Pleasant Light read,A feminine voice describing the fall from Grace of naive spoilt children.While I enjoyed learning about life from a Muslim woman domestic's perspective I was amused that the author veered away from in-depth descriptions of male characters- they were mostly absentee and the two who were featured were spoilt brats. The message that religion and the social support that comes with it is useful in a crisis came across strongly but I thought the main character was a bit unbelieveable - too soft and helpless - most of the Muslim women I know are the fightin' kind and I generally admire them for that!
5,Wonderful Read,"I was captivated by this novel from beginning to end. As a Muslim and a woman I really related to the character Najwa. Her gradual tansformation from a spoiled, somewhat shallow teen, to a pensive, observant Muslim is a pleasure to observe. This story is fictional, but the message is definitely real and it's something that could affect anyone. Najwa loses everything and hits rock bottom, but through faith in God, she's able to gain strength and not lose hope. This novel was wholly entertaining and superbly written. The characters were well developed, especially the despicable Anwar, one of Najwa's chief antagonists. I would recommend Minaret to anyone, especially Muslim women. I look forward to Aboulela's future novels."
5,"Finally, a healthy perspective of Muslim women","Finally, a healthy perspective of Muslim women! I really enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it. It provides an excellent view of Islam, Sudan, and the life of immigrants."
3,good,"The book was a little more shabby than I expected for ""good"", but for this prize it was OK and the package/postage reliable and fast."
2,A book that exemplifies its topic,"Sounds exciting, but actually, well, boring, mostly because the author fails to distinguish between two very different claims: first, that boredom, the state of mind, didn't exist until recently, and second, that it wasn't talked about much until recently. The first claim would be exciting and bizarre, but the argument at most supports the second."
5,Excellent account of 1913 flood,"I read this book many years ago when I was growing up in Dayton, Ohio. I had heard tales of the 1913 flood, but reading this book at the time made it all more real to me. Very well written, and quite descriptive with the sights and sounds and sometimes smells of the time leading up to and during the flood. Brought to life places that no longer existed when I was growing up, like the old Steele High School. A few years ago I stumbled upon an old copy at a library sale and snapped it up. I came home and reread it that night. Strongly recommended to history buffs and non-history buffs!"
1,Close Encounter of the Garbage Can,"That is where this book ended up, I bought this book at a used book store for a $1.50, figuring that a book that promises to be about aliens, abductions etc..and as thick as it was couldnt be that bad. It was worse. It wasnt even worthy of the 1.50 that i could have spent on a mcdonalds hamburger and a water."
2,Not worth purchasing,"I purchased this book as a I began preparing a unit on poetry. I noticed that most of my books had very little that would interest any of my male students. The selections in this book are too cliche. It seems as though the author thought boys don't like poetry so lets compile a bunch of very short, simple poems that pertain to male topics like sports, little sisters, and not liking homework and then they'll read it. The poetry has little to no thought in it. At least they could be humourous, but they're not even that. I Never Said I Wasn't Difficult by Sara Holbrook or various other titles by Sara Holbrook would be much better choices.*Mr. Charles Ghigna and the Random House Company have been very accomodating to me and I appreciate their excellent customer service. The very graciously returned the book."
4,Afrocuba who?????,"This is one of those bands that thanks to the embargo, no one knows about Stateside. I only found out about it in Leonardo Acosta's Cubano Be Cubano Bop history book about jazz in Havana (thank you Victor!). The CD cover leads you to think that it was recorded at Ronnie Scott's in London, but it wasn't. It's a fine studio recording, 100% done in Havana's Egrem studio, from two sessions in the 1980's and 1990's. Great liner notes in what is a simple product package added to what Acosta had already said about the band in his book. A laid back Iraquere, in three words. Jazz, Afrocuban, great singing and playing. I have only two CD's by AFRO CUBA, the other is from the FORBIDDEN CUBA series, and this is my favorite. Hope to see them live in my lifetime! By the way, is the cover foto la Quinta Avenida?"
4,Home Movies Season One,"Great, great, great. Love Home Movies. These episodes are all fantastic, though episode one is a little strange. If you're already familiar with the show, and you like it, then you'll love this. There's plenty of hilarious commentaries. While you don't really learn anything from them, you'll definitely get a kick out of 'em. There are some interviews with Loren Bouchard, Brendon Small and Jon Benjamin. They range from really interesting to kinda boring (surprisingly, it is Benjamin who proves to be the boring one). There are also some short films, one by Small and one by Benjamin. Both are hilarious. Buy this now!"
5,home movies dvd awesome,ive seen home movies a few times before on adult swim and loved it. i was curious so i bought the season one dvd yesterday. i havent seen an episode i havent liked yet! its a great buy...tons of laughs. Definetly a good time!
2,Kayla,"I didn't like this that because u have to useing your hand and swifting it and it takes all your time but I still like it that's why I give it two stars because it is very different.Sincerely, KAYLAP.S please respond."
1,Poor Kindle version,Oxford Dictionary of EnglishI purchased the kindle version of this book and I am disappointed. I normally used on my daily routine a dictionary as consultation tool but when I tried version it is terrible; it takes too long to look for possible options of an entry and then it gives you multiple selections where the word has been used in any contest on the dictionary and if you are lucky the definition of you entry would be on the first twenty of so. I used to have a PDF version of this dictionary which was marvelous. Please do not loss your money in this product I GRADED CERO.

3,I don't like for the Kindle Fire,"On my first Kindle I could search for a word and there it was. On the Fire I get every word that contains my search word but never get the actual word itself. An example is ""pone"" which comes up within other words such as op""pone""nt, post""pone"", etc. But where is the actual meaning of pone? Don't know why it is doing this and it is useless. I had to go to my old Kindle to look it up."

1,Bulletin,It was REALY bad. I Couldn't go to a page quickly. Don't buy it but you probably already have it.
1,An e-dictionary that can't be searched?!?!,"Perhaps I am missing something, but I can't get the dictionary on the Kindle Fire to actually find words. Well, it will find words but not the way you would expect. For instance, if you type the search word ""help"" the kindle will look for every instance of the word help within the text.Not exactly useful when one is looking up the meanings of words. Insipid and utterly useless."
5,"""The Dictionary""",As a South African who grew up in London this will always be my gold standard. Not sure why I was lucky but I slipped though a time window and ended up with it on my iPhone for free. Now the Kindle version is not available in the USA. Very glad to have it on my iPhone.

3,Super book,It is a great dictionary and I require it to everyone but it is a bit boring. It is also good for beginners who want to learn more about the English language.

3,Modern words for our dictionaries!!!!!,"Well, for starters it is just a dictionary so of course I didn't read the book like it was a kind of novel or anything. I do have one little concern IT DIDNT HAVE ANY MODERN WORDS!!!!!!!!The bitches who wrote this book if they want it to sell with middle school kids and teachers, they HAVE to have modern technology words too."

1,Evelise Rivera,I like this book because the book could help u with words and helps u understand the words better and clearly
1,Oxford dictionary of English,I did not read it nor did my daughter read it. The dictionary was selected in error by my daughter. Can be used to search for word definition.
1,Boo,Sucks nor in very hard to read don't like. The second one either please rate less please don't read this
1,Rather use a real dictionary!!:(,It is hard 2 find things and sometimes I don't know if it's just a caption or a definition. Just need a couple more words
1,Jonesie,Horrible waste of space and time for people who went to school.I wish i had known a dictionary would pop up constantly before i bought it.
1,Word Games,The utility will precipitate psychosis. The similarity to the Kindles other arcane features is a bummer. A comparison to the needle in a haystack comes to mind.
5,Awesome,"This dictionary or book was ok I mean I used it for school so I wouldn't have to get out my seat,but I guess,well in other ways the dictionary was awesome."
5,Very good,It was very good and I ‘think everyone should have it I love it food for traveling excellent very good
2,Long book,I love how it told you how yo completed it. Also I loved how I could see how I completed it and had every word I could think I've.
2,It's good,It's all right it took me a week to read it's pretty long as you see but it's good it told all the stuff it could I hope you like it too!
1,Bueno,Yo recomendaría este libro a muchas personas que an llegado a los Estados Unidos. me gustaron muchas cosas de este libro.i también lo recomiendo a todos los que vinen como visita para aprender más de lo que ahí o que palabras usamos
3,Not the internet but it's ok,I would recommend the internet instead of the dictionary definition from this book. Next time l need the definition of a word I would use the internet.
2,Ian,I thought this book was very educational. Thank you so much for this learning experience. This will help me advance my life.
2,Grrr,This book is boring but good for info. I wish it had better ways of explaining though it would help slot :)
1,Oxford Dictionary of English,To many words that Don`t even make sense that all the worlds are almost the same with just in numbers that do not make sense at all
1,Chey and the march band,Very informative and useful. You can use it to find pretty much any useful information that is needed at any time.
1,No me gusto!,"Se me hiso chido.Se lo recomendaria a mi primo.Me gusto para mí primo,y no me gustó para míMuchas gracias"
3,very helpful,This book was very helpful when looking up vocabulary words for homework and if I don't know what a word means in another book that I am reading.
2,Its about finding stuff or words that you know like an example like if you don't know the meaning of A look it up,Its a very good bookI like this book and I choose it because its goodI meant this book for me and my sister plus my mom and. Dad

1,Oxford Dictionary of English,Very boring but useful for study. Not very accurate to get to certain pages without memorizing parts.Review by Lucas Carlock
1,Bad and horrible,"I think it was too long and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone so don't read it. THANKS By,love you (not)"
1,Good,I think it is a good book and a good dictionaryIt is also a good way to learn EnglishThe book is fantastic
5,A grate book,I love the book you can take it on the go and you can search up the word but just with a regular book you have to flip pages and sometimes you can get paper cuts
4,It was helpful alot,It help me every time I needed a dictionary and also gave me the definition I needed every time I used one
3,The book with words,"This book was good and had words that I didn't even know was know was a real word like appley. The book was long ,but also had facts and examples on the word(s).the reason why the book got that rating was because it was also boarding all at the same time. But if u read it you'll learn new things. So kids give reading a try and maybe you will like it,maybe you won't but u won't know if u don't try."
2,Dicktornarie,Some thing to learn might expand your vocabularyThis was the first time since I've seen a lot of people who has been a lot nice
4,Dashonetta,I dislike the way the book is set up. I would recommend this book to language teachers for s lesson. This book is very interesting.

3,WHAT I THINK,I think this book is STUPID!!!!!(: I did not enjoy the book at all!!!!(: It was VERY BORING!!!!!!!(: I hated it!!!!(:
1,Boring,I picked this rating because it was boring and long and not really exciting. Make it a little more interesting by adding some dollar. Also made definitions shorter. Okay.

3,Dictionary,Gooddefinition but inconvenient to find specific definitions. Should have a more easy approach towards finding words and definitely should have a highlighting setting
5,English dictionary,This book has a meaning for any word you use everyday when communicating .this book is for everyone to use
5,For all people wanting to buy this book,"I really enjoyed this book because it was easy to read and find words that I didn't understand. Sometimes when you don't understand a word you feel a little stupid and silly, so you don't want to ask friend just in case they Laugh or make you feel worse. Now you can look up words wherever you are or one of your friends says something that you don't get. You don't want to be pulling out a dictionary and looking up a word. So this way in class you can pretend to read or something."

1,None,This is helpful book for people who don't total get our English language thank you for this book it was a good.
2,Why I like this thing,This is good for looking up words like for example zebra I didn't know what that meant so I looked it up and it says it is an animal
5,Awesome,I liked it a lot because it explains so much to me about the new words that I don't know how to pronounce or know the meaning of.
3,Ok,Its a bit confusing :•Not like a proper dictionaryFor God's sake I don't know what else to say why do I need 15 more words!?

5,Oxford dictionary of English,I liked this book because when ever we are trying to figure out a word that we don't know we can look at the definitions of the word and find out what the word of that definition means.
4,Oxford dictionary of English,It was very good and interesting so I gave it a 4 star buggy rich g g f f f y u v c k b u b
5,Thank the gods for dictionary's,I really liked looking at all the different words that are slang and different meani eacause who need a thesaurus
3,The dictionary,This is stupid because it's a dictionary and is it's boring I hate dictionaries but they can come in handy.
3,All about Oxford,This dictionary has a great variety of words. But sometimes I would like to know what all the new words mean. I think the creator of this dictionary should create a slang dictionary full of all the new words and phrases that people say today.
1,Eh,It was not a super great book and I want to borrow a super great book instead so I would have been a bit more better with a super great book.
5,DICTIONARY ROCKS,I think this is a great way to learn words you don't know that are ahead of you current learning path which allows you to be consider high in vocabulary level by you fellow colleges/students.
3,Oxford Dictionary of England,"This dictionary was really good with a lot of great words.I have chosen this rate, because I can go back and research the words and also I like reading dictionary's. What I dislike about this is that I think that it's just to many words so I just had skipped some pages."
4,Minecraft,God is dum minecraft tropical is a great way to get the controller under the bed dum day I was going on this page bookmark

5,Awesome,"It shows you all of the definitions of the book. Any word that you are looking for, they have it. So if you don't have this book, you need to go out and get it."

5,It Does What It Does - Well,"What's not to like (except the job itself)? It's rock solid, has a long enough handle, and does the low-tech job it's supposed to do very well. I've used this on a dozen small cabin roofs and am about to buy another one. I'm not a roofing professional, so I don't know what a ""bad"" one of these would be like, but I don't have any complaints with this one."
3,A useful book for beginners.,"A fairly typical primer on 80286/80386 assembly language programming, which starts out with the usual tutorial...reasonably well-paced, and pitched toward MASM. The assembler instructions are then discussed thoroughly, but it is not until the reader reaches the chapter ""Simple Programming Techniques"" that the book starts to shine. I found this a useful book when I moved up from 8-bit arithmetic routines to 16-bit routines. There are a number of well explained routines set out for the beginner which I first found useful when writing a fast Syracuse Algorithm program. The book is dated now, but much of the material is still relevannt, and there is some interesting historical background material on the mathematics co-processor, and interfacing it with the CPU. A useful addition to any assembly language programmers library."
2,people please!,This has got to be the most poor pop artist out there. I mean yeah he's got the looks and has maybe two good songs but then..........what???
4,Can't please everyone,"I bought one for each each my wife and myself. Although I found the snorkel terrific - I had no leaks and found that it easily purged, above and under water -- my wife thought the opposite. She's going to give it another try but was disappointed that it more often filled with water rather than purged. I first thoughyt it was a heavy snorkel, but while we swam the weight had no bearing on my experience. We'll trade on our next snorkel trip to see why the difference, but for now a hearty thumbs up from me, and a thumbs down from my wife."
5,Spiffy little phone case,"Very nice phone case and fantastic deal. The magnetic enclosure works, and looks real nice and classy, and the leather is of good quality. The perfect size for the specified cell phones it is designed for, and my Samsung SCH fits perfectly inside.I have not compared it to other cases, as this is my first for my cell phone, but it has great looks, great durability, and quality craftsmanship. No better deal then the price ... and it will last a long time with average wear and tear. I have a tendency to hit things with it on and my phone is in perfect shape as is the case. It does its job, is sturdy, and worthy of purchase."
1,Check before you buy!,"I had to wait several months before I could purchase this product because its rarely in stock. When I finally got I was pleased with the picture quality and features. Then 3 months later it completely died. I've been hassling with Toshiba to get it fixed for the last 5 months without any success so far. Before you buy this product or any other Toshiba product please check the Better Businss Bureau's web site (...). Click on ""Check out a Company"". Search ""Toshiba"" ""Irvine"" ""CA"". That says it all!"
2,Why are these things so expensive!,"I really wanted an electric cork opener but I am unwilling to pay over $20 for it. Also, I don't drink wine at home so much.This works just like the ones at the dollar store..just looks a little prettier."
2,Not like the others,"I would definitely stay away from these. I pulled out my cookie sheet with these one. The back of my thumb touched the rack, and I burned it. Yes I had a blister. Definitely not worth buying."
4,Masters of Their Craft,"These guys know there instrument and know them well. Complex instrumental movements with occasional vocals, trumpets, and one insanely talented drummer. This is indie rock for the aspiring musician. I recommend this to anyone who likes Don Caballero, A Minor Forest, God is an Astronaut, or the legendary band from Atlanta Toenut."
2,Disappointing,"It's obvious that the first Mechelle's Way was a stepping stone for Mechelle's Way 2. I own both, and found Mechelle's Way 1 to be confusing and disorienting: the workout is taped with Mechelle Smith's voice dubbed over the routine. It's obvious that the voice you hear does not fit Mechelle's mouth moving in the video, and sometimes the moves are ahead of her instructions. I found this distracting, and did not get a good workout. BUY MECHELLE'S WAY 2 INSTEAD -- it's FANTASTIC!"
5,"Gain confidence,strength,selfdefense techniques and attitude","This video gives women a great work out but most important unlike any other videos on the market it teaches women self defense techniques for protection. I have been working out with this video for 2 months and feel alot stronger,healthier and confident. I also feel more aware of my surroundings and better prepared to handle potential crisis or attack situations. I would recommend this to all women. I even have my 16 year old daughter work out to this video with me. The self defense techniques taught in this video are some of the best skills that I can learn and also pass on to my family and female friends."
3,"Good workout, poor format","This workout video is pretty good. It incorporates weights, cardio, and repetitive self defense training. The self defense portion is very short, but the rest of the video is dedicated to repeating the movements used until they become second nature. The commentary was somewhat delayed as it was dubbed over the video, and often the movements changed before the voice instructed the movements. The quality of this video was horrible! No matter how much I tried to track it, the picture remained blurry. For the price of this video, and the user reviews given, I expected a top notch production. This video is worth no more than ..., and I fear it will wear out soon. I'll have to find a way to make a back up copy in the event that this happens.Workout: 4Quality: 2Instructions: 3Value: 1Rating: 2.5 stars"
2,Very difficult and tedious reading,"I know Brian is an expert and that he has lots of good info to convey, but he ought to hire a ghost writer. The text in this disorganized book just rambles and rambles, to the point where so far I can't stand to read it long enough to learn from it. This may be a problem with me as much as the book, but I have this voice in the background constantly saying ""Man, get to the point!"" when I try to read it.I would not recommend it."
5,will change the way you think about shooting...,"I am fairly experienced with firearms and have trained with some of the best instructors in the country. I have read many of the better books written on the subject and will say that this is easily the best book written on shooting the handgun. Whether you are a competitive shooter, law enforcement or interested in personal defense, this book will change the way you think about shooting. The sections on shooting technique are worth the price of the book but where Enos goes above and beyond is in how he addresses the mental aspects of shooting. His treatment of mindset could be applied to any other sport or just everyday living. This book belongs on the shelf of any serious shooter. I've only finished my copy for the first time but it is already filled with highlighted passages and notes in the margins. Cannot recommend highly enough."
1,Mostly Boring Instrumentals,Very disappointed! I love Hawaiian music. I LOVED the 3rd song on this CD........But I did not know most of the music were BORING INSTRUMENTALS. They all sounded alike. A complete waste of talent. Just very let down when I finished listening. How could anyone rate it 5 stars is unbelievable.
5,HAPA IS THE BEST HAWAIIAN BAND!,"This is the CD that made me fall completely in love with Hapa. With incredible guitar melodies by Barry Flanagan and the beautiful lead vocals by Kelii Kanealii... I have had this CD since it first came out in 1992, and I still have not gotten tired of it. Hapa conveys so many emotions in their music. From the strong, traditional Hawaiian songs, to the truly beautiful melodies of the instrumentals, Hapa doesn't fail to impress me no matter how many times I see them perform or listen to their CD. This is music that will make you close your eyes and give you chills..."
5,Beautiful CD,"If you are looking for a very traditional album of Hawaiian music, then this may not be the album for you. But, if you are looking for a wonderful fusion of traditional and contemporary music, with fantastic guitar playing and vocals, then you will love this album. Hapa, in my opinion, captures the rhythms and spirit of Hawaii with a contemporary flair. Whenever I feel stressed, this wonderful album puts me in a great mood."
5,Brilliant art from beautiful Hawaii,"For anyone who has been to Hawaii and has personally witnessed the awsome beauty of this true paradise will love this album (and this group). My wife and I have been to Maui four times, and we have listened to Hapa music hundreds of times. Each time their music takes us back to that paradise.Hapa's music is not just nice ambient music appropriate to the relaxing lifestyle of Hawaii. Their music is truly inspired and brilliant.Art can communicate something--a concept, a thought, a vision, a feeling--at a particular angle that gets under your skin and ""connects"". A brilliant painting can capture the beauty of a Hawaiian coast in a more penetrating and true way than a photograph can. Same with music. Listening to Hapa from my home in Colorado instantly pleases and takes me right back to that most beautiful place called Hawaii!Buy this CD and listen to it. Like looking at a beatiful coast line, you'll never tire of it."
5,Captures the feeling of the Hawaiian Islands in music form,"We purchased our HAPA CD while vacationing in gorgeous Kauai, and now that we are (sadly) back home to reality, the CD gives us a chance to take a quick mental vacation back to the island."
1,YUCK,"do you know how little the readers of these books are?like, 6 or even 4!!! bratz introduces little girls to kissing,dates, proms, and boyfriends. so don't buy it for your children!it's inappropiate! ( it really bothers me, too. )"
1,STUPID!,"I hate this book! It isn't really even a book! It's just pictures of ugly Jade and her friends showing off their inappropriate clothing to five year olds, who will be the only ones who will read this.There is a story about Jade and her boyfriend going to the prom - in a book for kindergartners!The tatoos are stickers that won't even stay on.Don't buy this book. It's just a waste of money, and it teaches little kids to spell things wrong. On the cover, they have three words misspelled: Brats, extreme, and cool are spelled Bratz, xtreme, and kool. That's not cool, it's stupid."
3,You deserve to know.....,"JBL... I have like JBL products for about 20 years now.. so when i got these speakers from amazon, at a great price, I expected JBL. Well you can read the other reviews as far as the sound goes. I have mine in a 3 car garage not the best place to evaluate a pair of speakers. On the back of the speakers you will see a tag MADE IN CHINA. I just thought you all deserved to know before you buy. If you say you dont care, I understand. But dont let you kid chew on the speaker cabinet, it probably has lead in it."
3,Black Ash boring - bring back cherry,Seems like the JBL Venue series replaces the JBL Northridge series so sound quality should be ok - but you could get cherry and beech cabinets with the Northridge series - cherry looks FANTASTIC. Last time I had black ash it was easily marred and looked like it belonged in a funeral home! Bring back cherry and a 3 way center channel like the JBL Northridge EC35!
5,Good Buy,"I got these speakers today and hooked them up. I was a little disapointed when i heard them for the first time, because I expected top quality from JBL. But when I turned them up they sound absolutly great!! They extremely clean crisp sound and a pretty good deal of bass. So for the price(which is amazing) you absolutly cannot do better. I give them an A over all. But if money is no object Klipsch is a better speaker, but then again they start at about $900 a pair."
5,Very Impressed!,"Im stepping up from a $400 Sony 5.1 Surround Sound that came all together...First I Purchased the Sony STR-DG910 7.1 Channel that puts out 110 watts per channel....Thats whats these speakers handle continously... Got these in today, hooked them up to the two front channels by themselves and was very impressed... Highs are crystal clear, very surprised how much bass these speakers put consider Im going to get the JBL 12 inch subwoofer...But these speakers are incredible.. anyone who rates these bad either dont have the right power source or they're tryin to get something out of these that isn't made to be gotten out of such as ALOT OF BASS! Get a subwoofer and dont turn the bass up on these."
5,JBL Floor Standing Speaker,"Excellent product, fast shipping. Will not be the last or first time I purchase from Amazon."
1,Watch what your kids are watching,"Like many other Strawberry Shortcake videos, I tuned this one out while my daughter watched it, not because it's not good. I'm just not a Shortcake fan. My attention was yanked back when I heard a character in this episode use the word ""hate"" multiple times. Most of the S.S. videos are good, but I threw this one out. My daughter will most likely be exposed to hate in many other places. I don't need to hear it on her children's videos."
4,nice,"This movie was nice but one thing Strawberry was overly sweet and sugary, that's not very realistic."
2,Good... but not for younger ones,This is a good video except for one unforseen problem. Both stories revolve around characters who are behaving very badly in their whole attitudes. Eventually the characters learn their lessons but they have a lot of temper tantrums in the mean time. Unfortunately these bad tempered mouthy little girls are the ones my daughter has decided to model and now when she's mad she recites these tantrums back at me word for word. So we don't watch these anymore. She does like them though. I'm sorry to have had to take them away. My daughter is 3.
5,Strawberry shortcake-play day surprise,My daughter loves this movie. It's all bout being a good sport. Lots of music and fun
2,Awful.,"This guide was extremely disappointing. I bought it after I discovered the $20 FSO guide straight from the registration site was just a practice test, but now I know I was better off with the first one. This book is full of badly phrased questions, spelling/grammar errors, and a few things that aren't even applicable to the subject matter based on the two official practice tests I've taken. It's not updated for the new format of the test either, as a previous reviewer mentioned. The only potentially useful thing about it is the Oral Assessment Guide, which demystified the process a bit for me.Don't waste your money on it."
4,Utilitarian and useful,"I passed with its help, so that's something. If you're interested in taking the test, this does a good job of preparing you for what to expect. It can't really teach to the test - the exam is much too broad, you pretty much have to know this stuff already through years of curious participation with the world - but there are a few things that it helps with, and just knowing more about what's coming helps.I found the practice tests in here tougher than the actual one - which is just what you want in a practice test."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is awful. I took the FSOT twice and have a solid background in international relations. I thought surely with my education and just reviewing this study guide I'd be fine. Wrong, I failed. Everyone I saw going into the testing room had a copy too, so if the vast majority of test takers are still failing the exam obviously this isn't that big of a help. Honestly, the material is just too basic and incomplete to really prepare you for the FSOT. This wasn't even worth the $6 I paid. I rented other FSOT books, the few that there are, from the library and they're not much better. So I guess in a sea of awful this is the best. However, if you're serious about passing (and I hope this is allowed) I wouldn't waste my time and just spend the money on a course from fsotprep.com . I spent 2 weeks with their course and passed with a VERY high score finally. I'm now preparing for the second round of interviews. I can't recommend them highly enough."
2,False sense of security.......,"This study manual's only saving grace is its grammar section; otherwise, you can find something better. Truth be known, the FSOT is a 3-hour exam that I completed upon appointment at a testing center and it was a myriad of standard questions that cannot really be studied for. Why? The multiple-choice test covers several current events and past historical events, including a map section and a one-essay section. The section on biographical information was difficult as you only get 30-40 words per questionaire section.The most challenging section on the FSOT? Grammar and essay hands down. Get yourself a literature/grammar textbook and study THAT as well. The rest of this study guide is truly ""for the birds.""Conclusion: D+ (and only for the grammar review)Try instead flash cards:FSOT Flashcard Secrets: FSOT Exam Practice Questions & Review for the Foreign Service Officer Test"
1,Horrible,"I can't say if the study guide will help with the test, I am not scheduled to take it for another month. I found the grammar section to contain typo's in their supposed correct answer key. I thought I was going crazy so I had my grammar nazi of a fiancee check and she concurred that they were incorrect. The general knowledge questions seem to be a lot more challenging than the official test guide so I am not sure how the actual test will be. I will update this post after taking the FSOT in June."
4,Good for getting prepared,I find this book to have been usefull in preparing me to take the FSWE. It went over lots of different usefull questions. it covered alot of different areas.
2,Design flaw,"This cover makes my A900 look unique and I have had several compliments on the look of my phone, but I never mention that I had to take a small saw and cut a piece of this faceplate off so that my home, as well as my car charger can actually plug in. Looks great, but it's poorly designed."
5,CUCINA Fig and Savory Flower --- great scent,"CUCINA line of Fruits & Passion products is one of my favorites. I love the Fig scent for my kitchen, it's clean and fresh without being overpowering ... their Influence line of Bamboo Hibiscus home scent is used throughout my home and it is the scent that greets guests, as I use the reed diffuser. Enjoy!"
5,Wonderful soap,"This is a great product for getting the garlic and onion smell off your hands after cooking. A little goes a long way, too!"
4,Wet suit,"Tight fit but once it's one it does the job. You can swim without any irritation, interference or fabric hampering your stroke...I did a mile with no problem. You can tell it's massed produced and made quick, but the quality seems to be there, definitely a good bang-for-the-buck given the price."
4,It works,"I used it for a tri, and it work very good. May be it not so pretty like others more expensive, but very good for the preice."
5,A masterful book that will invoke great change in its reader,"As a certified Master Life Coach myself, I welcome this amazing book. It guides the reader in the process as they learn to dig deep and connect to their true self. It is one of the best self help books I have read. If you want accelerated growth, and if you want to make real change happen quickly, this book will assist you in doing that.I have found some new skills within myself and have begun using some of these techniques in my own practice.This is truely an amazing book that takes a better approach than most self help books and you will experience results."
2,Not for me,"This was too daytime-talk-show for me. She talks about affirmations and intentions and being ""true"" to yourself. This isn't what I need. I'm already true to myself, I just need a job."
2,Change your life in 30 days,"I became skeptical and frustrated with case content presented without solid grounded logic and rather arguments steeped in forced word associations and benchmarking tactics that lack substative authority. The goals of this book are compelling, their methodology seemed flawed to use for acedemic purposes. The changing of a words common authoratative definition is serious issue and I think the editing in this area for authority purposes would discard this issue which gets in the way of a otherwise book that does offer some nice exercises in self exploration. I hope Rhonda gets a better editor."
5,A can't say BUY these enough!,"I have to agree with the other gentleman who reviewed this. These are great educational DVDs. They are made with the student in mind. If you have a need for a history lesson, NOT taught History Channel style, then you need these."
3,"Just OK, no significant result","little sweet, but doesn't help ease constipation...can't really tell any improvements on anything after taking these pills."
2,Not the superior product I thought it would be,This was recommended to me by a Veterinarian specializing in Dermatology. It did not provide the effect I was told it would and feel equal or better products are more readily avail. at lower or the same price.
4,Nice and light,This is a good workout. I think Amira does a great job of creating a calm and soothing workout for mom's to be. I did all three sections and didn't break a sweat. I think if you want a good stretch type of video this is for you but this video lacks intensity and is not really a work out.I did like her insight on how the western world is the only place where women lay down to give birth and due to all the sitting and driving we do most of out muscles needed for childbirth are stiff. This video aims at giving you more flexibility and preparing you for child birth which was great.Would definitely recommend you buy as an add on video to a more rigorous work-out.
5,Just what I was looking for,"This is exactly what I need right now - I'm 4 months pregnant, completely stiff/sore from eliminating most exercise since I'm so tired. The stretching exercises alone are helping me loosen up some."
4,Pretty good,"This video is pretty good. It was very relaxing and had a lot of good visuals and information about birth. The stretches and moves for labor were great, as well. There was not a whole lot of actual bellydance-just a few basic moves, and limited yoga as well. This certainly is not a video to watch if you expect it to challenge you beyond stretching, but it is still great to have."
4,Nice and soothing,"I wasn't looking for a high-energy cardio, and this was a great selection. Wish there was more yoga, but this is a very neat pregnancy workout. I am 23 weeks and this is a great relaxing and baby-soothing workout."
2,DVD itself is very poor quality,"I've purchased TWO of these DVDs, and while the program itself is great - when the DVD works - for the most part, the menus get stuck or skip sections, little squares pop up on the screen, and its very frustrating to try to get it to work because of the poor quality. I have no problems with any other dvd I put in my player, and this has happened with both DVDs. =("
5,Grateful for a great pregnancy work-out,I absolutely loved Amira's Belly Dance & Yoga for Pregnancy DVD. I found out about this DVD from FitPregnancy.com and used the exercises almost everyday while pregnant. It was the first time I've tried belly dancing and I really enjoyed it. Amira made learning it very easy. Her stregnth moves gave me confidence in the delivery room and made me feel physically fit and confident while pregnant. I did not gain much weight during my pregnancy and I owe that her!
3,not as stable as I expected,"Box kites are supposed to be stable and easy to fly. This one likes to dive-bomb to the ground. The bridle on the kite seems to be wrong... it's only a single bridle at the top of a post. I was able to improve the stability and lift by adding another attach point, and by adding a piece of string between the two bridles. I looked up some ""how to build a box kite"" websites for hints on how a box kite should be attached."
3,This book goes in to depth about toasters and other thins,This book goes in to depth about toasters and other things i thought it was a very interesting book
1,If your taste buds are already shot - go ahead!,Not good. Your better of just skipping the candy bar altogether as these will just have you running to the machine for a Reese's Cup.Awful.
1,Very misleading title,"If anything about this lecture can be considered fun, then hell is going to be a real party. The first half of the DVD (it seemed like about 3 hours, but was probably 45 minutes) consists of Ms Tigue seated, unmoving, with folded hands, staring directly into the camera and reciting a carefully memorized lecture. The camera angle never changes. To be fair, Ms Tigue articulates well, and she does not abuse the English language as do so many nowadays. But, several times, I found my mind wandering, and I'm afraid I didn't retain a great deal.In the second half of the video, Ms Brown demonstrates cooking techniques and recipes, while Ms Tigue nods approvingly. In this segment they employ a second camera positioned slightly higher to demonstrate chopping and mixing and slicing. Ms Brown also articulates well, but overworks the word, ""actually"".I'm sure the stars of this show are competent and perhaps even talented, but they should have hired an equally able film maker."
5,awsome game,I absolutely love this game it was alittle hard at first but once I got a hold of the walkthrough it has been easyer.
4,james bond 007 from Sayda,okay i like the game but they are VERY MISLEADING(lying) about the shipping price. i paid 3.99 for shipping but on the package it say it cost 0.44.... am i mad about them price gouging? no because even if the price really was 4.70 i still would have bought it. none the less shipment was fast and the game is fun.
2,Fuller Mop Rusting!,I was totally satisfied with the Fuller mop that I ordered until it started rusting - after 3 uses!! I certainly won't buy another one!
1,Does not work.,"This was a used piece of junk. Some type of glue on the front. But most of all i does not work, still trying to see if can be returned."
5,No problems in 10 years!,I've owned this TV since 1999 with absolutely no problems. The picture still looks as sharp as the day I bought it. I can't comment on the sound quality of the built-in speakers as I run the audio through my receiver and speakers.I highly recommend it.
5,The Human Spirit,"The Chimney Tree is an engrossing book that I read in just one day. I had to keep reminding myself that it was fiction rather than fact.The character, Breindel, illustrates the magnificent strength of the human spirit. One just marvels at her will to go on and prays for her survival."
5,great,"very thin and flimsy, but works fine, cheap, serves my purposes of putting my juicer on top of two unused burners"
2,Not deep enough,"These don't even come close to covering my burners. There's a good 3/4"" gap between the bottom of the cover, and the top of my stove. It looks ridiculous. I never had this problem before, with any covers I've ever owned. Be careful folks, these are REALLY short. Comically short. Now it makes sense to me why the price is so cheap.And Black? Forget about getting black. More fingerprints show up on this thing than touching an iPad."
1,Reston Lloyd Rectangular covers,"Received these items damaged around the edges. Good thing it's black, kinda hides the dents that are around it, unless of course you're 3 feet away then the dents are visible."
2,Bad fit,These stove covers did not fit my gas stove properly. They weren't deep enough to cover them and were to wide. Make sure and measure before you buy. Didn't return them because the shipping alone both ways was the price of the covers.
2,burner covers,Does not fit well. very thin and looks like it will bend easly. Probaly would not buy again
4,Not bad for the price,"Just recieved these and am pretty happy. They are a little on the flimsy side, and do not sit level, but i have a U-shaped 5 burner gas stove and they fit between the double and single burners, which I was nervous about, and am happy with how they fit. You do get what you pay for, but these aree a decent, inexpensive cover if you need a little exra counter space."
3,Just fine.,"A little bit of silicon footing would help these out. They cover the electric elements on our stove just fine but slide around noisily on the enamel surface of the stove itself. Anyways, they're fine."
2,Pretty but.....,I received my stove burner covers which are very pretty but they do not lay flat on the stovetop. If i push them in the middle they will stay for a while but then the metal seems to move and it pops up on the two diagonal corners. I have switched them and even put them on a flat surface but the same keeps happening.
3,"Reston Lloyd Rectangular Stove Burner Covers, Set of 2, Roses","I think this item is nice looking and I am happy with the Purchase,only wish it was a little thicker , and a little higher"
3,Have to return them...,"...They aren't tall enough to fit my gas range. They are only 8/10 of an inch tall and my burners are about 1 1/2"" tall. Bummer. Would have been a good idea to measure before ordering.These are the painted tin ones like you see at Wal-Mart, about as heavy as a cookie tin. I knew this before ordering though. For some reason, they don't seem to make the enamel-on-steel ones that they used to."
5,Kitchen Appliance,"I bought burner covers from another vendor last year and was very disappointed. They were flimsy, dented very easily and were hard to clean without scratching off the design. I found new covers from Amazon and should have used Amazon in the first place. Their vendor was quick to deliver, the product is of good quality and sturdy with a bright, with an ""easily cleanable"" surface. I should know better than to go shopping around. I am very happy, my kitchen looks better and my stove burners are protected from flying pet hair -- and hopping pets (LOL)! Excellent product quality, excellent service."
4,Incorrect size,"I had seen this on Walter Drake and was surprise to find it on Amazon.com with a length of 19-3/4"" verses the 20"". It was 20""'s when it came yesterday. For it to set level on my cooktop I needed the smaller of the two. However, being the mother of invention, I can manipulate just fine."
4,Stove Burner Covers,I did like this item...it covers the burners completely and helps to keep the dust off the burners for easier cleaning. They could have been a little deeper since they did not completely touch the stove top and hovered above slightly. Maybe my burners are a little higher then most. But I do like the look and the ease of cleaning.
1,"This was received bent and they were very thin, it was bent on the corner where it couldn't be fixed. I wrote back, no response.","I was very disappointed. The item was bent upon arrival, the product was very thin. I replied to the company about the issue and have not had any response. Will not purchase again."
3,wrong size,"The covers are great, they look nice and all but I have to get them cut down. They are too long."
5,Stove covers,I think the covers are perfect They make my stove look great I love them They complete my stove & protects the top of my stove.
4,"Fast delivery, so-so shape","The product arrived VERY quickly, but due to a lack of packing material to pad it from damage (I can only assume) there were a couple of dents, and the covers didn't nest together well. Overall, not a big problem though."
3,not as photo shows,"The photo shows these to have variations in color...sort of a marbled effect. This is why I ordered them. Unfortunately, they turned out to be a solid color. I will keep them anyway, since they still serve the purpose for which I bought them."
4,BURNER COVER(S),"MY DAUGHTER ASKED ME WHY DID I CHOOSE THIS DESIGN(BARNYARD ROOSTERS).I TOLD HER IT WAS THE ONLY DESIGN THAT WOULD FIT THE COLOR SCHEME OF MY KITCHEN. I SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND COULD NOT FIND THE DESIGN OR COLOR I REALLY WANTED.SO NOW I AM REDECORATING MY KITCHEN TO GO WITH THE COVERS. YOU'VE GUESSED IT...""COUNTRY KITCHEN!"" I MIGHT SUBMIT A PICURE OR VIDEO WHEN DONE!"
2,Ugly and thin tin,"These are not ""deep"" enough to completely cover the burners. It would fit ok but my stove has a vent on the rear that prevents these from fitting correctly. They just float on top. I ended up buying a huge 20"" x 30"" cutting board that did the trick perfectly and beautifully. These arrived dented even though they were well protected. They are just thin tin and easily dent."
3,"Does the job, but doesn't fit","Amazon's size description is different than the size description from the package when I received it. My stove is slightly smaller than the cover size that Amazon indicated, so I thought the covers would fit perfectly. However, when I received the covers, the packaging gave a smaller size description. When I placed the covers on the stove, it turns out that the covers cannot completely cover the stove. The cover can fit over one corner of the stove; the other corners of the stove stay exposed. However, it does cover the stove. It does the job, but not to the fullest. I wouldn't have purchased the covers if I knew the true size."
5,Did what it said it would do and more,"I purchased this for my son, He said it does just what he wanted them to do. Cover an old stove & gives him more space.......He rents an apartment with his two active and always hungry son's. This helps him keep the kicthen more organized.........and speedy delivery in time for Christmas giving.........That's why I just had to rate this a 5 STAR"
4,I would have done 5 stars...,but they are a little wobbly. I love the finsihed look they give my kitchen and the extra space when entertaining to set up bowls of food. I would recommend and purchase again!
3,Okay,They don't stay to clean finger print wise and they don't really fit very well on top the burners. But they will work for now.
2,"Covers too shallow, too long","The color was correct, the covers are too long so they slide around the stove top, they are too shallow for a new stove with the tall burner spiders so they sit on top of the spiders and already getting dented. They do cover the burners but not that well. Therefore, one star for correct color, one star for covering the burners albeit not so well, minus three stars for poor sizing!"
4,hob covers,"A nice design a little to big for my hob, but still does the joband keep my hob clean, very quick delivery and excellent service"
2,Disappointing,"Mine came bent out of shape, and I couldn't pop them straight. And they were packaged well too, meaning its likely they were warped to begin with. Too bad bc they're sort of cute and I really wanted to like them."
1,"Reston Lloyd Rectangular Stove Burner Covers, Set of 2, Black","Thin, do not fit standard electric burners. They are too wide to fit the burners. Not happy with these. Feel they were a waste of money."
3,Stove burner covers,Like the 2 covers better than 4 covers. Have not used long enough to really know if I like or not.
4,"Easy read, held my attention","I love a book where the characters actually have their own personalities. The books by Miriam Minger that I've read have that - you would never mistake one person from another because they are all so different and fit into their own roles so well.The story lines are a little predictable if you are used to reading romantic fiction: you know, they have tremendous odds they must overcome to be together but it always works out in the end. You just read the book to see how the author does it this time! LOL!Miriam Minger must surely be a sweet personality because it comes through in her books. I wouldn't hesitate to buy and read more by this author."
4,calling the wild,"this is hard sounding album also she lets her softer side show and lemmy is singing with her on this album too. doro is a lady and a rocker, a good combo. the one disapointing probelm with this japanese import is dose not show the video.over all good album."
2,"Great music, terrible mastering","This review is limited to the recent two-CD remaster. Calling the Wild remains one of Doro Pesch's better releases. The music runs mainly toward melodic hard rock with a few ballads, and one cover song. Unfortunately, this edition was undercut by appallingly poor mastering. The main problem with the engineering is that the bass tones are raised so high in the mix that they completely dominate the songs, almost drowning out Doro's vocals. There is also too much compression and bass distortion, so that the instrumental backdrop becomes an undifferentiated mass of sound. Even on the acoustic tracks, the bass is up so high that the vocals and lead guitar are almost buried. By comparison, the original version of this CD, which has much better sound quality, rates four stars."
4,Well-documented and exhaustive,"Jerry Clark has demonstrated himself to be the leading historian of UFOlogy with the two editions of his UFO Encyclopedia. These hefty volumes pretty much cover the bases, with plenty of documentation for further study, and are a useful resource for those who have already taken a position (no matter what it might be) on the UFO issue as well as those who are undecided."
4,Base knowledge for enthusiast/researcher,"Through base knowledge of the ufo history/lore. Two volumes not cheap, but a must if you're really building a ""reference"" library."
4,Great System,Nice Sound. The speakers have a minor buzz when no music is playing but when a cd is playing its not a problem. Good System for the price.
1,just quit working,"I used this product once and for no apparent reason the sound quit working. Everything else seems to be functioning well. Just no sound. I called the factory, and they were very nice and told me that I needed to send it back to them with a note explaining what went wrong and a copy of the receipt. I am awaiting the outcome."
5,an upbeat and engaging collection of singalong songs,We love this tape! Makes you want to go out and buy a ukulele! The choice of songs are a breathe of fresh air from the standard kid's music fare. Ms. Jackson's tunes are guaranteed to put you in a good mood! Thanks Ukulele Lady.
1,In vaery bad taste...,"If you liked Mitch Miller's awful sing-a-long lp's in the 50's, you'll love this CD, where Victoria Jackson sings more often out of key, then in. Bad arangements and cheezy back up singers, amount to only so much muzak. This CD is insulting to me(not to mention very tacky sounding), because I am someone who thinks that the 20's style JAZZ Ukelele player/singer needs to be preserved(the music of Cliff Edwards, et. al.). One person who is doing it very well in the 20's tradition is Janet Klein & Her Parlor Boys, she can play the Uke(I don't mean Hawaiian style, I mean ragtime, and jazz) and she sings in the Annette Hanshaw, and Jane Green tradition. [...]"
2,"Excellent electronics, with a useless mounting scheme","While the detection features work well, the -hardware- (I use the term loosely) used to mount the contraption to your windshield is poorly designed. The design flaw is a failure to account for the earth's pesky gravity feature. The mechanism uses an L-shaped bracket. The lower end slips into the top of the detector and upper end has suction cups that attached to the windshield. The lower end depends upon an upward force (unobtainable by normal methods) to hold slits in the bracket against bars on the bottom of the housing. It would work much better if the bars were on the top, then gravity would be your friend. This results in the eventual inability to mount the damnable contraption. However, the electronics work very well."
2,Just an average detector,"My first detector was a Bel 890, i enjoyed its ditgal voice message, free the drive from have to look at the detector. I only bought this one because it was a cordless and thinking it would make driving in VA or DC easier. Little did i know that a cordless has far less detection range. The difference in the range with or without the optional cord is like night and day. So i had to purchase the optional coiled power cord. I would recommend anyone who wants a detector with the cord out of sight to by a normal detector with straight power cord or direct connection cord and not this cordless detector. To say nothing of many the false alarms this one has. I have since bought a Bel 985 and highly recommend you do the same."
3,Toshiba 61h70 HDTV,"Very good overall but a few annoying glitches. The set is very difficult to watch when the screen turns black as the screen mirrors everything in the room when lights are on.The directions in the manual could use a great deal of improvement. when directions are followed the desired result is not always accomplished.. The picture is excellent if you can control the lights. The set is very heavy and this resulted in delivery problems. You must be very knowledgeable if you are going to set up the wiring of vcrs, dvd, Direct TV, Cspan, Roof top antenna ,cable etc. You must also spend a lot of time reading and playing with the remote to find all the goodies this TV can do."
1,Amazon and OpticSale are Liars!,"OpticSale dont have the product. They are liars and they bait and switch. They waste your time, you dont hear from them for 10 days and when you try to find out what happened they state they dont have the product in stock but offer you a 'recommended item' but if you do go back to Amazon it still shows that Amazon is promoting this fraud by listing the product as in stock when they are quite aware that for over 2 weeks now, it isnt.If you arent buying from Amazon directly, go to eBay and avoid these people. Their 3rd parties are just as useless but they are at least cheaper and charge less for shipping. Otherwise Amazon is just a disinterested, absent landlord that does not care about their customers as much as they do their 'selling partners'.As I said, eBay....."
3,A good start,"Scott is quite a talented saxophonist and this comes out clearly in his debut album. `Lost in the moment' is a smooth jazz masterpiece that deserves a listen from any true Jazz lover. `Déjà vu' is a reassurance that there is more to come from Scott - but not in this album. He writes all of the tunes, but they still need a bit more work.I'm certain that his following CD will only get better. He's just not quite there yet."
1,Ugh.........................,Hardly memorable. There is are many reasons why this one went underground (and is still going.......) I'm giving you another one.
3,The limits of the new perspective,"Dunn introduced a new perspective on Paul, showing that he was more in the line of a Jewish proselyte than a theologian rejecting his roots.His study on Galatians remains nevertheless within a classical mold and although his knowledge of Greek makes him often come close to understand Paul he fails in my mind to see the real strategies behind Paul's arguments.I read the book with both interest and irritation. It remains recommendable for students who have not matured their own positions and are still in need for an authoritative mentor."
4,Great sculpt; sound is poor,"The sculpt on this large-sized figure is amazing; looks so much like Harry Potter/Daniel Radcliffe. The wand is great too - looks just like the wands used in the movie. The sound feature is somewhat disappointing; the quality is not great for the sound, and the clips carry much of the background noise from the movie, including other characters besides Harry Potter. It would be better for kids to leave the sound feature off and just play with the figure. The Jack Sparrow figure had a much better sound feature. The figure also arrived with the head popped off; it was easy enough to put back on though."
3,It talks!,"The figure is huge (18 in). I also found out that it talks (I thought the sound woule be more like music). The talking would have been great, except that the phrases are kind of scary. Essentially something like: ""he's dead, he's dead, Voldemort is dead"", and several incantations, all said in highly dramatic fashion. I almost fainted one day when the thing started an incantation by itself - out of the blue. Turns out it is motion activated. Overall, it is pretty cool for a hard core fan - I just thought it would be a harmless little figure. Not what I was looking for."
5,Heaven...,"I originally found this at King Soopers/Ralphs then they stopped carrying it.I loooooooove this tea. It has a nice smokey, honey flavor. You can really ""sink your teeth"" into it. This is one tea that tastes the way it smells. It is absolutely lovely and cozy. It's my absolute favorite tea.I wish they'd make it caffeine free.UPDATE 4/29/12:Celestial Seasonings has discontinued this product and I am sad. It is my absolute favorite tea ever. I have tried other black teas, and while I like them, NONE compare to this one. I hope they bring it back because I will be the first one to purchase it."
3,Leaves an annoying residue,I had really dry skin so I decided to try the deep conditioning moistuiser to apply to my legs at night after I take a shower. While it may have softened my legs some it makes my legs feel sticky hours after aplying the lotion. I can't get to sleep at night because I can't stand the feeling of the sheets clinging to my legs.
2,Rehash of previous work,"I was so disappointed. This book is about 80% material that was previously published in a much classier book, A Wonderful Time. Readers lucky enough to have the earlier book should not waste their money on this rehash."
3,Socially very interesting... photographically relatively interesting,"A wonderful insight into the age, the cars, the houses, the parties, the people.Photographically of relative interest. Shot mainly in attractive period color but arguably a little posed at times. It could go a lot further."
2,Nice towel; stuff sticks to it.,"I really like this towel for its functionality. I like the snaps vs. velcro that I have had on other towels like this and it's a good size but still lightweight enough to carry in a gym bag. However, it only comes in white and due to the nature of the fabric, EVERTHING sticks to it and doesn't come off. If you have pets, this towel will inevitably become covered in cat or dog hair. Anything else that may be on your carpet/bed/furniture is also going to stick to it. Also, the feel of the fabric before you have washed it several times is kind of creepy. It kind of sticks to the skin on your hands, especially around your cuticles unless you have just moisturized. I have a robe of the same fabric, and when I bought this towel I thought it would be a different kind of fabric - like the microfiber headwraps that Aquis makes. I wouldn't have bought it otherwise."
1,I didn't like it at all,"I am a male. I did a search and this item showed up for men. However, it is way too long for a man unless he is Yao Ming. It looked like I was wearing a skirt and came down several inches below my knees. I am 5'10"" tall.Also the light wieght microfiber terry was a drawback. It clings to you and builds up a lot of static electricity.I will not ever buy another product made of this material."
3,"It's great, til you use it","I ordered this because I really needed it for my at home facials I receive. So actually not real heavy use or wear and tear. But, Using it the 1st time the snaps came off. Upon further inspection...the snaps are barley holding on because of the thickness of the robe. For my $30 plus dollars you'd think it wouldn't do this. Especially when for $1.97 I went to WAL-MART and replaced the same snaps with bigger ones. I hate the headache of returns and I needed the robe so just repaired it myself."
3,Tough Slog CD Player Repairing,"There is no substitute for practice as any doctor or lawyer will tell you. The same goes for CD player repairing. With functions highly dependent on micro-controller chips, trouble-shooting a CD player is mostly black box guesswork. Manufacturers' service manuals, if available, usually do not provide test requirements to expedite fault isolation. This book can be read two ways, ""it's too complicated for me to get involved,"" or, ""just as I thought, I had to pay to find out what I suspected already, there ain't much help out there."" Welcome to the world of throw-away products. Consumer electronics is now so dependent on jealously guarded intellectual property rights the consumption rate has reached epic proportions - so much for building a green economy. This book is more for the curious than for the serious audio repair technician."
2,Not what I expected!!!,"After all the rave over this from others, just did not live up to the HYPE!!The wait was much too long, as well."
3,Interesting and exhausting,"It's easy to tell that Maxwell put a lot of thought into her world bulding for this book. The biggest problem I had with this book was, in fact, the complexity. It was often hard for me to keep up with the new rules/developments Maxwell laid down. I loved the characters, but the book was an exhausting read."
2,Meandering and mazelike,"I tried to follow the story here but it seemed to constantly veer off in other directions. There's magic and fantasy and time travel and psi-hunters and the names...why do authors feel compelled to create words that cannot be either pronounced or remembered? Za'arain, Jhoramon, Szarth, Xtian, Kiriy.The story involves concepts like live time and dead time and people(?) who could control one of these and who - guess what - fall in love. We are also dealing with a prophecy that has been around since the dawn of the Universe it seems and all this becomes a hopeless mishmash toward the end. Not worth the effort."
2,Don't buy it because of the author ...,"I have everything she has written under all of her names and let me tell you, THIS IS THE WORST! I like to read just about anything and I love Sci-FI, Fantasy, and Romance. But, I just couldn't get through this one. I tried multiple times and finally today I decided it had to be me, so I went on line to see what others thought to make sure. I got 3/4 of the way through it this time and I still don't understand it. I like the concept that another reviewer explained to me, but I don't know how they derived that from this collection of unpronounciable, unexplained, lengthy composition. Save yourself a headache and buy something else."
4,Goooooood Book!.,"The story line was so good that I wish that I could have given it five stars; and I would have if the author had not rum amuck. This is the first time I have read anything by Ann Maxwell, and it would have beem my last if I had had anything els to read. Do your self a favor and push your way through the first chapter. Although it makes little or no sense in the begaining, it sets the entire story up nicely. Maxwell's use of double negatives and nonsense was enought to make the reader want to scream. Her imagination made you forgive her, as she pulled you into the story and her characters lives. It was so very enchanting. This was a truly good book."
3,4 Stars for the performance vs 2 Stars for the audio/video = 3 Stars,"Amazon has their Nutcracker DVDs a bit scrambled.This release is the same as the one listed a few above here. Both are DVDs of the 1978 Bolshoi performance. The RE-release may have been done in 2004 but this is a much more primitive production dating from 1978. I've reviewed it above with the other listing, and also the same performance on a different Kultur Video release, also listed above with different cover art.In a nutshell, the performance is great (especially the two principals) but the production (i.e. sound and video production) is primitive. If you can get past the poor production then it's a diamond in the rough. If you can't it's just rough. At $5 or less though it's hard to go too wrong."
3,Adequate,"This bag is good for long weekends if you need your laptop and not much other gear. I do not like the weight distribution, if you place it on the ground, it continually falls forward. It is a comfortable and functional pack, good for hiking, day trips, and air travel etc. but the layout was not exactly what I was looking for and I found it to be a bit smaller than expected. I do like the pack and it is decent for the $$$."
5,"From Dave, as promised Maneesh!","I was pretty confident with both my PC and my Macintosh at home, but nothing special until I was browsing the internet, and this book really interested me. I was running a tight budget, so I decided to take it out of the library before I made the decision to buy it. I made a mistake that I realized after reading two chapters. I shouldn't have wasted time taking it out of the library, I should have bought it right away. Now I am the proud owner of it. I also recommend his new book about web design. I haven't read it, but I trust Maneesh is an amazing writer."
5,Offering fellow teens his own set of processes for learning game programming,"Game Programming For Teens, 2nd Edition by Maneesh Sethi tells teens how to program their own games, developing skills needed to produce a video game from graphics to sound and music. Sethi is himself a California high school student who has long worked in web design and gaming, offering fellow teens his own set of processes for learning game programming. The goal of Game Programming For Teens is to have the teen create a working game by book's end - and any teen who follows Sethi's directions will find themselves with a game to their name."
3,Very BASIC (no pun intended),"I bought this book looking for a real challenge (i'm an novice at game programming). I work with Java (sucks) so I thought that BASIC wouldnt be that hard, well it wasnt. This book is really toward the really casual gamer, not for someone who wants to design the next Halo. It uses Blitz Basic, which is really easy to learn. I learned it by just reading through the book. I goes through a quick run down of every essencial part of a game for it to work, but just looking at the book, you really cant expand on BASIC. You can create 2D stuff, but nothing suprising. If you are a beginning gamer with no experiance in programming whatsoever, than you can think about picking this book up. If you are looking for a challenge, then look for something else."
5,Great book!,"This book is good at what it's suppose to do: Teach you how to make 2D games. But I rather take the hard way and learn C/C++ and DirectX. I also don't like the idea of having to pay 60 bucks for the full version. Well you don't have to buy it but you can't make executables without it. I'll give it 5 stars because this is a review for the book, not BlitzBasic. I still recommend all of you to learn C/C++ and DirectX, though. There are much more books about that and you really don't need a ""for Teens"" book to learn it. I'm a teen myself if anybody cares..."
5,Great Book,It is a simple tutorial in beginning to program games in blitzbasic. It is well written and pretty easy to follow. I enjoyed the book and expect to use the new skills in future projects.
1,Keep Looking,"Haven't read the book - but the intro chapter I can see online tells me this 'BlitzMax' language requires you to buy the compiler from the author's website to get the full capabilities. Otherwise you can't really make programs, game or otherwise, except on your own machine. And I see from a few other comments here that the demo (limited) version of BlitzMax that comes with the book expires after a few uses?! This isn't mentioned anywhere in the book's description...I'm a programmer myself, shopping for an intro text for my nephew. You can get a free compiler for just about any modern programming language - no one should have to pay for a compiler. I can only guess that the author wrote the book to help sell his BlitzMax compiler. LAME!Think I'll get him ""Scratch Programming for Teens"" instead; just checked wikipedia, Scratch is a (free!) educational programming language developed by the MIT Media lab."
3,Not for those wishing to be professionals.,"I don't actually own it, but I've read a considerable amount of it. It looks like a good introduction to Blitz Basic, but Blitz Basic itself is generally much simpler than languages used in industrial situations, such as C and C++, and many say that languages based on BASIC teach bad habits for those languages and is not flexible or fast enough. However, this book teaches several important language-nonspecific concepts, and is good for someone programming games for fun, rather than profit.EDIT: Note that I am NOT saying that this is a bad book for it's subject matter. I am merely saying that there are many different ways for ""teens""(I happen to be one myself, if you care) to get in to game programming, some of which are more powerful and more often used professionally."
4,Not to painful,"I am an adult and this looked like a good place to start....it was. A good beginning, sorta like yer first year as a padwan."
2,Okay but deceptive,"The book makes it sound like you get some free software to use. In reality you get some limited time shareware and have to purchase another $80 to $100 dollars of software from the author. In reality this gets to be an expensive proposition. The book makes extensive use and reference to the software, and almost requires it's purchase. There is some free source code on the CD, and the software on the CD is free, but only for 30 days."
2,Pretty good,This product is great when everythig is set up.. But getting there is horrible. Stuck the key in and it snapped and was stuck in there. The battery compartment is broke. Other than that its a solid safe so much space.
4,Price is right,"For the price I just don't think you can beat it. It is strong, heavy duty and is a nice size. Instructions were easy to follow and the lock work well."
2,This is going back !,"I wrote a comment in the ""our packaging"" section .It appears to me that this safe was already a customer return. The original First Alert box was torn,had a couple of holes and was re-taped . . .a lot ! Also the lock cover was missing,the batteries were already installed AND one battery leaked causing corrosion. At first we thought we'd keep the safe,it did work,but it seemed it would be more trouble to return it.It weighs 71 lbs.and the box wouldn't take another trip with UPS ! The inside also has a very bad odor that I thought would go away.(new safe smell ?)I've tried several fabric/solid room fresheners and I put the shelf outside all day today ! Nothing works. Very disappointed in this product. Somehow we will send this back."
2,Could have been better,"Nice safe and all, when i received the safe the front door wasn't even lined up straight, which makes it easier to pry it open. The bolted edge was crooked which leaves the bottom edge almost a full inch away from the frame. Quality check apparently wasn't in that day, if they even have one."
1,No Mounting Ability (as described),"The safe arrived on time and in good condition. It is of a reasonable quality and works well.The negative issue with the safe is that there are no holes drilled, no screws provided nor are there mounting brackets in the box, as stated in the description.For as good as the safe is, it is essentially worthless since it cannot be mounted to the floor or wall and a crook could simply come in and take the whole piece away."
1,Defective products,"The safe I ordered from First Alert would not set the combination at all, which is probably the most essential feature of a safe. Customer service is a joke, I called two days in a row and followed instructions to a T, only to have the safe lock out both times and the rep telling me to call back in an hour after the lock out had reset. A waste of time and money."
2,Let me in,"We rec'd the safe and there is a dent/scrap on the top. The biggest problem is the safe doesn't open. We called Honeywell and were told to replace the battery, which is in the safe we can't open. Then were asked why we don't use the key to open the safe. Well if you shake the 70lb. safe it sounds as if the key is locked in it, or else we didn't receive it. Called today, we were told that a master key was being shipped out in 3-5 business days. The size of the safe is what we were looking for, but the safe is useless to us if we can't get it to open so we gave it 2 stars."
2,ADHESIVE ON SAFE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE!,"If you want a safe that is unbalanced and has THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE ADHESIVE TO REMOVE ( from the sticker that covers 90% of the front of the safe, ) BUY IT! If you want a good reliable safe that has more security than 3 inch bolts for 2 holes in the back of the safe for the wall OR 2 bolts for the floor, THEY ONLY SEND 2 BOLTS FOR MOUNTING & SECURING TO MOUNTING PLACE ( STUDS ) - I cannot repeat enough how hard it is to get the adhesive off, and the adhesive is attached to a piece of paper with instructions on how to get into the safe ( example, the fact that it has a hidden key default opening )- Go with something that won't take 3 hours removing the sticker from!!!!"
3,"Decent safe, does the job...","Wish it had a key locking mechanism as well for added security, but it's not design for that, knew that going in...overalIt's a solid safe adequate for my application...would recommend if someone doesn't want to keep very valuable item, anyone who has combo can get in..such as employee looking over your shoulder, kids finding out combo some how etc....very roomy inside and can be bolted down to prevent from getting stolen..."
2,You get what you pay for!,"Listen, for $125 its a good safe!No fire protection, and you can probably break into it with a can opener, but if you dont want to fork over the $3-400 for the Sentry, this is a cheap option."
2,mike,The quality no good and I don't like it. I don't recommend to buy it. Buy the other one if you don't want to feel sad.
2,Check Radiator Cap Fit,"Just purchased and installed this part. The installation went well. However, the stock OEM radiator cap will not fit on the version of this unit we purchased. We had to go back to Vista Pro, who advised some units manufactred had this problem. Check the fit of your radiator cap first, before doing installation work. Vista Pro advised they are sending us a radiator cap that will work.LR Dan"
2,forget it,"These were a real disappointment - they tasted of nothing - and given the hefty price, I would not suggest that they be purchased. I have had other sugar free caramels that cost less and tasted much better."
3,An enjoyable suprise,"Now, I am not one who traditionally likes to read poetry, but I checked this book out from the library and finished it by the end of the day, and not only that but I found it to be quite a delight. The only problem is that it seemed the book went too fast and didn't focus enough on each character and their lives at the house, or afterwards for that matter. However, I would still reccomend this book to all my friends"
4,Keesha's House,"I really liked this book because of the life situations that happened in the book. Normally I don't like the set up of a book going from character to character just explaining what they are feeling and what they think because it confuses me, but i really did like this one. I like the way it seems so realistic. It made me think of how these situatuations really do happen to people in the real world and I just wanted to reach into the book and help the troubled teens out and just talk to them. I guess I will have to say my favorite charater was Keesha because of the way she had to do with helping out the teens even though the house wasn't her own. I really like this book and would recommend it to other people to read!"
4,Good But Incomplete,"I have been referencing this guide since purchasing it way back in 1979 (the hard cover was originally titled The New York Philharmonic Guide To The Symphony). Generally the composition descriptions are quite informative and include the instrumentation. But there are some glaring omissions : Barber - Adagio For Strings; Bizet - L`Arlesienne Suites; Anything by Borodin; Aaron Copland`s Rodeo and Danzon Cubano; Elgar`s Pomp and Circumstance Marches; Grieg`s Peer Gynt, Holberg and Lyric Suites; Holst - The Planets; Stravinsky`s Apollo, etc. In their place are a number of obscure ""modern"" pieces which you might never hear in your entire life."
1,This Book Made Me Crazy,"""Without Reason"", is not a book for newly diagnosed families. I read it when my son was first diagnosed and it put me in a state of depression I could not get out of, I actually had to stop reading before the end. Maybe I missed the enlightening or helpful part. What I read was how his autistic brother was beaten and put in a institution, with no chance of hope."
4,Gorgeous Voice of Figgy Duff: Pamela Morgan,"Figgy Duff, a seminal Newfoundland folk-rock band, disbanded with the death of Noel Dinn in 1993 at 45 from liver cancer, but Pamela Morgan, Duff's vocalist and one of the most beautiful voices on any disc, carries the torch of Figgy Duff at AmberMusic.ca and has added her own albums to the list, with On A Wing and A Prayer being similar to Downstream. The sound is Celtic-like but also pop. If you buy one Figgy Duff CD you'll start tracking them all down sooner or later. Better get started with Downstream! While you are at it, check out other Newfoundland groups: Great Big Sea and Rollins Cross (recently reunited and touring for a compilation disc from Warner Canada)."
1,disappointing movie,The movie looked really good but it was disappointing. It was boring and I did not care for the story
1,Purchase was canceled,For some reason the purchase as canceled and I didn't get the product.I don't know what happened. Nobody got in touch.
4,Thought this book had great advice,"I just finished reading this book in preparation for the terrible twos (my daughter is 16 months.) I thought it contained a lot of good, practical, logical advice. I was surprised at how long ago this book was written but I agreed with a lot of what the author had to say & feel it's applicable in today's world. The format is nice as he clearly and succinctly talks about different issues in the toddler years then has question and answer formats for questions from parents. There were one or two things that caused a raised eyebrow, hence the 4 not 5 stars but overall I thought this was a very helpful book that I plan to refer to as we hit the terrible twos."
4,Did the negative reviewers read the same book I did?,"I just finished this book and thought it had many positive insights. A friend gave it to me and I was a bit turned off by the fact it was an 'older' book. But to my surprise it offers a lot of common sense approaches to problems. Just like all parenting books, I take what I think will work for me and use it and massage any other techniques that I think need massaging. I read some of the negative reviews on this book and I can't believe some said he advocates spanking! He actually writes that he is AGAINST spanking in almost all circumstances. He also does not advocate letting your baby cry all night in bed - to the contrary! He suggests that you go in every five minutes to hug and kiss your child to reassure the little one. What is cruel about that? We are talking toddlers here, not infants. I still can't understand how others read the exact opposite of what I read."
2,not my cup of tea,"I thought Rosemond's thoughts on play were valuable. I did go through my two-year old's toy box and got rid of all the toys that don't require any imagination, and his ability to stay with one activity increased dramatically.However, I wouldn't recommend this book because I feel that his advice is archaic and unsubstantiated. He recommends making your child feel like he or she is no longer the center of your life, that you are the center of theirs. I see his point, but I have a hard time with that. What's wrong with a child feeling so important to a parent? Also, I'm just not comfortable with letting him roam the house unsupervised for extended periods of time. I feel that at his young age, he needs adult interaction. not all the time, but most of the time.I guess I have more of an attachment style, and Rosemond's recommendations for the most part just didn't sit well with me."
2,overrated,This is by far one of the least helpful parenting books I have read. I used numerous suggestions in this book and NONE of them proved to be effective. Using my own judgment and keeping calm with a positive attitude toward my toddler proved to be more effective then anything mentioned here. His suggestions for head banging are completely stupid and made my toddler bang her head harder during a tantrum. Not recommended.
1,"Condescending to parents, almost hostile to children","The tone of this book is surprisingly obnoxious. In order to get his point across, the author repeatedly engages in ""straw man"" attacks against parents he has met during speaking engagements. Essentially, all parents are painfully clueless and the only parenting approach that works for any and all children is - yes, of course, the author's."
1,He thinks spanking is OK,"While I have to admit I did get a few good ideas from this book, when he started talking about when it's OK to spank, I couldn't believe it. Then he went on to suggest a few pages later that you allow the babysitter to go about 50 yards in the car with your child not buckled in (when they were discussing a problem with the toddler not wanting to get in the car seat with a car pooler). After I read that, I decided to put the book down and never pick it up again. It's going in the trash!"
1,Reactionary nonesense,"This book is very heavy on the ""old-fashioned common sense is all you need"" theme and tends to simplify and glorify the parenting realities of the past. Sorry Mr. Rosmond, but things weren't all that peachy 70 years ago. And the world we live in today is a far different one from the pre-WWII era you idealize in your book. The author is totally dismissive of any and all modern ideas about parenting. His outright condemnation of daycare and casual acceptance of ""popping""/hitting a child turned me off completely. If you're looking for some helpful advice on dealing with the challenge of teaching a two year old to (eventually) become a responsible, considerate and happy person, then keep looking. You won't find find it in this reactionary tripe."
1,Anti love and family,"If you have any respect for the loving bond between a parent and child do not purchase this book for any advice. The author makes negative remarks against several respected childcare experts including Dr. Sears. He thinks 18 months is a magical age to quit giving your child ""too much attention."" He also has no respect for a childs sense of self and how to develop it. He makes psychologists seem like a worthless bunch of idiots. I was enraged after reading only the first chapter. Trust your God given intuition Not this man."
3,Terrible Twos Not So Terrific,"I thought the book had several good tips but the other reviews led me to believe that there would be more. It's worth the price, but there just isn't that much to do except be consistent and firm, while loving."
3,"Beautiful Art, Not Enough Process","Mike Mignola's amazing art for Hellboy looks very different from anything else being used in comics today. His distinct linework and inking style, combined with a well-honed eye for panel layout makes his artwork a perfect complement to his stories.That said, this book is mostly a collection of finished art, covers and promotional pieces. What I really expected from an ""Art of"" book was process, sketches, and perhaps some discussion of technique. A fair comparison would be the recent Usagi Yojimbo art book or the Blacksad Sketch Files.Maybe one of these days Mr. Mignola will put out a ""Making of Hellboy"" book that fills the gaps. The few sketches and thumbnails in this book really aren't enough."
2,"Oh, hell with it","Mike Mignola's comic books are great. You should buy them instead of this overpriced collection of Mignola art. The very thing that makes Hellboy so beautiful, the simplicity and elegance of design, means that looking at a Mignola sketch is exactly like looking at a finished comic book panel, except you can see the India ink brush marks in the black areas, and there is no supporting narrative thrust to give the picture meaning. The same goes for his pencils (of which there are few included- I don't think this guy makes a mark on paper without inking and publishing it). There is not even a discussion of Mignola's sources or inspirations, no bibliography of the occult (oh, I forgot, we're living in post-literate America). There is no insight to be gained by investing in the Art of Hellboy, because it is just a sampler of beautifully designed panels that look better in the comic books."
5,For College Student,"Bought for Grandson who will go to college next year, and learning to cook. His Mother said she will use it too."
2,Okay but,This is just an okay cookbook. I teach cooking classes to middle schoolers. I was searching for some good ideas and really didn't find anything new. Cute concept.
4,Great Book for Beginners on a Budget,"I first encountered ""The Starving Student's Cookbook"" the year it was released. Although I was a fairly accomplished cook, I was dealing with an extremely limited budget and a friend gave me the book thinking it might help me to cope. I found it immensely entertaining and, although it was geared to beginners and thus far below my skill level, it had tips that even I could use. If you are new to cooking, on a budget, or know some young (or not so young) person who needs help learning to feed themselves nutritiously and inexpensively, this book is a great place to start. It will teach you the basics with clear, gently humourous instructions."
5,"Yummy! Easy to use; great for students, kids, klutzy cooks..","From breakfast to late night, apple pie to zucchini and eggs, ""The Starving Students' Cookbook"" has a little something for everyone. By keeping the recipes and ingredients both simple and easy, even the most 'culinary-challenged' person can whip up a great macaroni-tuna casserole previously thought unreachable! Also, this is a good cookbook for kids just learning to cook, and offers a little bit of everything. This is the second edition of ""Starving Students',"" with the most notable -- and welcome -- addition being the chapter on microwave cooking. All-around good food, cooking and nutrition tips make ""The Starving Students' Cookbook"" a welcome addition to any kitchen, large or small."
5,Great Book!,I have been out of college for many years and still love this book. I do not enjoy cooking and this book has a lot of great but simple ideas that don't require a ton of steps.
4,From an EMT student,"It's true what the previous reviewer said, it's not that gory. However, the scenes aren't for sensitive viewers, either. Some scenes are too grizzly for public television. If you're curious about the kind of trauma calls and deaths that EMTs/Paramedics sometimes have to deal with, then you might like it. If you're in EMS, you'll like it. Some people may not like the DVD because a lot is going on, and they don't understand the terminology/procedures that are being performed on scene by rescuers. Sometimes, people expect to see eyeballs, guts, and brains splattered all over the place. If that's what you're into, then stick to hollywood movies. In real life, super gory-hollywood style trauma accidents are rare. Overall, it's an interesting DVD to watch if you want to catch a glimpse of the lives of street medics."
2,Paramedics 1,I was not all that impressed with the DVD. Some of the scenes are ok. But I don't think I would have bought the DVD if I had known what it was like. It is really not gory at all. I don't recommend it. I think you can find better out there.
4,just what i ordered,great pot.....................thats all i can say at this time besides that i boiled water n made an artichoke stuffed with bulbs of garlic.......keep u posted on how it has turned out.
4,Perfect size and color,I love the size and the color of this pot. It is perfect for a lot of things I make in the kitchen.
5,nice shackle - decent price,"nice price, quick delivery, heavy shackle, purchased to throw in the off-road tool box, just in case - confident in having it when i need it - highly recommended"
1,Don't bother ordering it. You will not get a 10 pack like stated,3 Times in a row I got the wrong item. It was suppose to be a 10 pack. Avoid this item.
2,A Disappointment,"I bought this pan for my daughter's birthday party. I decided to test it out prior to the ""event"" and I'm glad I did! I used Pam, but the cake totally stuck. I then tried it again (boxed mix, both times) and lined each individual section with parchment paper (a REAL PAIN), PAM'd that, and it was a little better.Now, my daughter has her heart set on a butterfly cake, and I'm going to have to make this work out somehow. I will try it with a cake from scratch, as suggested by another reviewer...hopefully it will help! This pan is a real disappointment."
3,Not the Greatest,My daughter is into butterflies so I got this to make her birthday cake. No easy task. It is awkward because it is so big ( jelly roll pan size). And the cake doesn't come out. I made 2 cakes. 1 white and 1 chocolate. Luckily between the 2 I was able to salvage enough pieces to make a somewhat descent looking butterfly.
3,No Sample Files or data,"This book covers an important topic that other Excel authors skim or omit. It is just a shame that there is no CD or download for the examples presented in the book. I wrote the publisher and was sent a zip file with a couple of files, but not nearly enough to be able to practice or try out the techniques described in the book. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars."
2,Not for the typical user,I was hoping that this book would provide the typical user with more insight into using excel efficiently. I consider myself to be computer savy and have used excel for years. I felt like this was aimed more at people who had more of a computer programming background. I feel as though learning the use of pivot tables and other functions that this book goes into would almost be an exercise in using a whole new product - rather than enhancing the use of something I already understand. Hopefully one day I will have the time to immerse myself in the subject and put it to use.
3,The season where things go downhill,"I truly love Ranma 1/2, however this is the season where is just goes bad. If your looking for a good multi-eps arc like in the 1st and 2nd season, sorry but there isn't any.The majority of the eps are self-containted and very dumb. Predictable endings with cookie cutter plot lines.The ONLY exception to this is that this season enters the best character in the Ranma 1/2 world. Ukyou (or Ukyo), is another of Ranma's brides to be however the twist to her relationship with Ranma is he actually LIKES her (As a friend). Any episode she is in is like a breath of fresh air into the series because she is NORMAL!If you have season 1 and 2 you might as well buy this. If you already own the VHS versions it's not worth the upgrade."
4,"Excellent mystery series, but...","I LOVE Miss Silver. This series predates Agatha Christie's Miss Marple and IMHO, excels Christie.However, it is highway robbery to charge nearly $10 per book. Many are out of print, and some libraries have discarded their older copies, so Amazon thinks it can do this profitably. I doubt it. I for one will scour used book outlets rather than pay this exorbitant price.Usually Amazon is the reader's friend. What is going on here?"
4,Agatha Christie light,"I bought this book because it was recommended as similar to Agatha Christie. I don't think it is as well written, but the characters are interesting. A nice light read."
1,Stretching,"I'm a 4th gup in Tang Soo Do and was looking for some help in the stretching area. This video did not come through. The instructor does an excellent job of walking you through lots of different stretches and the proper technique and then falls extremely short on the actual application part. His ""daily stretching routine"" was nothing more than what I learned from my P.E. coach in junior high."
3,Not much examples to do,"I've already had the Stretching by Anderson book and I thought it would bethe nice idea to follow up the instructor. However, the tape came out to be muchless that I've expected, based on the book. The introductory to stretching is too longeven for the beginners and the most frustrating part, there is not much examples tofollow up even for the basic daily routine .Also I've expected it appearance to be done much more professional."
4,Entering the silence,"A genre of ""true confessions"" (spiritual autobiography) can become self-indulgent. Seldom self-indulgent but always confessional is how I recall this Advent journey of Father Henri when first published; the same holds true today. Several generations of confessional heirs again re-enter the monastic enclosure of Our Lady of the Genesee in upstate New York preceded by author and Friend, Father Henri. His invitation in this diary induces silence of soul for readers in joyful anticipation of first and second Advents of Christ."
5,"Left-brain companion to Norris' ""Cloister Walk""","A highly stimulating account of Nouwen's experiences as a ""temporary Trappist"" (itself a contradiction in terms which he explores with sensitivity). Nouwen is brutally honest in his self-analysis without becoming maudlin or pompous, and his struggle to learn to pray in the midst of distractions from within and without should resonate with people (like me!) who find themselves too often consumed with busyness and the monologues of an undisciplined consciousness. Best of all, Nouwen acknowledges that his time with the Trappists does not solve his problems; rather, it teaches him the rudiments of praise in the midst of problems."
4,Brought a Big Smile to my Wife,We purchased this as a gift to for my wife for mother's day. She is absolutely delighted with it. It is exactly as promised. Had to go buy the movie and watch it when this arrived.
1,Gizmo not so good.,"this toy was very sloppily put together, there's little glue pieces falling off of it with chuncks of fur. it's real clear to me looking at it if i let the kid play with it who i bought it for it is going to just fall apart. Very low quality, i would not recommend anyone buy this toy for any reason. pay a little more for better quality."
2,Not to happy,"I expected it to look alot better, it's already falling apart. It almost looks like they just put it together yesterday."
4,Adorable and durable,Recieved two of these little guys for my grandchildren after seeing the movie. They take them with them everywhere. The youngest sleeps with hers.
3,GIZMO PLUSH TOY,PROMISED THIS TO MY DAUGHTER INSTEAD OF WINNING IT AND CARRYING IT ALL DAY AT KINGS ISLAND. GREAT PRICE & GOOD QUALITY.....JUST A LITTLE SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED!,"When I first found him in a small store in chinatown, I was lead to believe that this little guy would be a good pet. The only warnings I got were these three things: 1) keep him out of the light 2) don't get him wet and 3) don't feed him after 10pm. Well, that man in chinatown is going to get an earful from me! A few nights ago my one pet became SEVERAL pets, and now there are these disgusting pods in my attic stinking my whole house up. I'd keep on going, but I hear something upstairs and I'd better go check it out..."
1,Does not appear to do anything,"I have had this machine up and running for a week and caught about 7 mosquitos and there is no lack of mosquitos in my yard! I did not hook up the carbon dioxide cylinder since it would cost me about $90 to buy and another $20 to fill. I can't take the chance of putting more money into this. I am going to return this to Sportsmans and eat the loss of shipping costs.As a side note, I am thinking that the only two positive reviews on this are by people selling them. I have looked all over the internet and can't find anything positive except on the seller's website."
2,Does not work well for Asian Tiger mosquitos,"Despite claims it just doesn't work well against Asian tiger mosquitos. I don't think any unit will. These mosquitos seem to get attracted to mainly by visually seeing your movement amongst others.I've seen the mosquitos get attracted to the unit at times (usually in the evening) and are all over it, but don't get inside the unit for whatever reason. I've tried using just pure electiric mode and CO2 as well, just doesn't work in Austin, TX.I'm back to spraying the bayer's mosquito-b-gone thing on the bushes and grass. That works very well, if done right and periodically. Doesn't ever get rid of them completely but reduces to a great extent in just a day or two."
3,pretty kitty! but still have fleas,"IMPORTANT NOTES: The bottle says For Cats & Kittens, but in tiny tiny print on the back it says DO NOT APPLY to kittens under 12 weeks. It also says that if a human gets this on their skin or clothes, they need to wash/rinse for 15-20 minutes. ETC!We washed our two new kittens with this product. The shampoo left their coats soft and fluffy, and smelling great! However, I could still see live fleas on the kitten immediately after the bath. I decided/hoped that the shampoo probably had a delayed reaction on the fleas. For the next few days, scratching was greatly reduced and we cleaned the house, did the linens, etc. However, the fleas are now back in full force. I don't know if we missed eggs etc in the carpeting or what, but we need to try something else."
3,Not for the risk averse,"This book intelligent and is well written. However, it's discussion is contingent on accepting that maximizing the geometric growth rate (i.e. logarithmic utility) is the best objective function for a trader. This produces a very aggressive betting strategy. I would advise finding out a little more on ""Kelly Betting"" (try Blackjack resources) before going ahead with this."
5,This Book is Must Read for those Mathematically Inclined,"... I must have close to a 100 trading books and this one is a gem. As Elder points out in one of his books there are three legs that support successful trading: Trading Strategy, Psychology and Money Management. Optimal F which is well explained in this book is the best measure of your Risk/Reward. Knowing the optimal f of a trade allows you to compare apples and oranges. I can tell if trading a stock option with a potential return of 1000% is better than trading a stock with a potential return of 20%."
2,It's the least important thing you need to manage your money,"Ralph Vince is a good teacher, good lecturer who it seemed to be capable of making decent money in an ideal market scenario where there is no transaction fees, no liquidity risk and bad things happen to an amount that you can ""manage"" them. If you manage money like him in a real world then you go bankrupt very quickly."
3,Another Schism,"The book is well written, reflecting level of education. The author is no dummy.However, the community is better served to realize that there is a divide between Modern Portfolio Theory, followers of quantitative methods ad infitum, and those followers of Practical Portfolio Theory, who are more or less followers of the Edwards & Maggee/Wyckoff schools of trading thought.My recommendation is to identify to which school of thought you belong and simply lay to rest the other quack books that come along."
3,"Music is Great, CD is edited though, which wasn't advertised.","I love the music on this CD, but Slip of the Tongue is edited, and this CD was not advertised as being edited. When I listen to music, I like to hear it as the artist intended."
3,The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste,"This book is very informative and revealing concerning what we think about ourselves and how we think or feel others think of us that affects our behavior. It is easy to read and has a very good outline format. It gives detail examples and major research concerning the subjects. It also lists the definitions for important words and has internet reference sites. In addition, the summary of the book is in outline format. This book has many pluses and I enjoyed using it."
4,Fresh and filling,I've been happy with the EAS CarbControl bars I've purchased from Amazon. They're pretty fresh (sometimes the ones I get from WalMart are not so much) and I've always loved the product because they're so protein and fiber-heavy that they leave me satisfied until lunch. I just wish they'd stick to their flavors. Whenever I get to really liking one (like the old chocolate strawberry mousse - I really miss that one) they discontinue it and I have to find another. This is the best non-chocolate-flavored one I've found.
3,Works Great,"You have to bend the pieces that stick through the rim to get it to stay, but works great."
4,Now I'm a Street-Ball Champion!,"For the money you can't go wrong or make one like it unless you get the chain for free. The ""S"" hooks don't fit perfectly and I had to bend a few. I also taped them to the rim which helps. It's also a great theft deterrent as it would take some time to steal it if you wrapped it well. I love the sound of the ball swishin' the chains. Very durable and time will tell how strong it is... If you're tired of replacing the string nets every few months, like I was, this is the net for you."
5,Beautiful CD compilation by Newfoundland's Figgy Duff,"For those who deeply love the soul and spirit of Celtic music, this CD is manna from heaven in the grand Newfoundland tradition. The promised land is right here on this spectacular collection featuring outstanding heartfelt musicianship and exquisite, haunting vocals from Pamela Morgan. The songs on ""Figgy Duff-- A Retrospective: 1974-1993"" are truly timeless, gorgeous, and intensely spiritual. Listing highlights is pointless as every song is a carefully crafted gem. Simply stunning!"
4,Entertaining Historical Mystery,"Seneca Falls NY was the site of the Women's Rights Convention of 1848. Against this backdrop we are introduced to Glynis Tryon, a spinister librarian, who stumbles into a murder mystery. This is a cozy mystery, with most of the mayhem taking place off the pages of the book. An entertaining read, and a very interesting heroine, who chooses to be single, at a time when that was very difficult. The mystery wasn't too difficult to solve, but I enjoyed all the history and the numerous real life people woven into the background of the story. A good first entry in what promises to be an enjoyable series."
4,A Gentle Crime Novel,"Miriam grace Monfredo's first novel neatly blends the culture of the time with an engaging double murder, though no one makes the connection between the murders at first. Her heroine, Glynis Tyrone, struggles with her role in life as a single working woman during an unforgiving era. Monfredo does an excellent job of weaving social issues into the fiber of the mystery. She does a less masterful job of developing the other characters, who tend to drift into stereotypes. Overall, I recommend this novel as a nice light read."
2,"Clear writing, nice history, but little entertainment or humor","I typically enjoy historical novels, and I was particularly interested in both the NY state region as well as the suffragist movement. Despite clear writing and a rather interesting mystery, I found the book pretty dull. I didn't find the main characters engaging, and there was absolutely no humor to lighten up the story -- seemed more like a bleak look at the plight of women in Seneca Falls, with no silver lining, just despair and helplessness. I read it to find out how the mystery was resolved, but I won't be reading another. I prefer mysteries with more humor, spunk, and character development (Amelia Peabody, Vicky Bliss, Daisy Dalrymple, Charlotte Pitt)."
2,Not for precision,"For a vise it works very well... but if using for drilling or milling get another. The vise lifts up from the moving jaw, so u can never level ur object. It also, the screw acts as a swivel and the jaw pivots to the sides."
5,Not considered a toy in my opinion. Very well made!,"Not considered a toy in my opinion. Very well made! Heavy construction, Nice machined surfaces. ThisMini Viseis metal not plastic. Works excellent on my dremel press!"
1,"If you wish to do any work with this device, skip it.","I purchased this vise to work in conjunction with a Dremel drill press that I have, and I must say that this vise is ultra light duty. The first time I used it to hold a workpiece, the jaws stripped out. Luckily, I still had the packaging so I could return it to Amazon.Do yourself a favor, spend a bit more cash and get a good quality vise."
1,"Oh, No Show","Mr. H.G. Lewis should have quit after ""The Gore Gore Girls"". This insufferable mess will only please fans of Troma-type junk. During the 60's & 70's Lewis created a genre which was clever, sometimes witty & down-right mean-spirited. Now, well into his 80's, he delivers a combination of dreadfully unfunny humor & tired gore which ""he"" believes is fresh and groundbreaking. You'll have more fun reading one of his Ad/copy tutorials. Nice try, but no ci-gore."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"The first 1/2 of the book is enjoyable as Siddons is very talented in describing the environment and uniqueness of the Carolina Lowcountry. There is good character development and I found myself very vested in the characters and what happened to them. Then it all fell apart. The story line totally stalled, the events became unbelievalbe (Hello!? She's 13 years old!!!) and none of the subplots were tied up. Very disappointing."
1,Serious disappointment,"I have enjoyed most every book Ms. Siddons has written, but this one left me cold. Poorly written, poorly edited, unbelievable. I love dogs, but the use of the lovely Boykin spaniels in this book was just smarmy. I'm sorry I spent the money on this hard cover edition."
2,Sweetwater Creek,"An avid modern fiction fan, I usually delight in books written by this author. This book was not up to her usual spellbinding capabilities. It left me disappointed; the main character, Emily, just did not come together, and why would any family foist their grown, unstable daughter, Lulu, on another family indefinitely?"
4,Very much Enjoyed,"I received this novel for Christmas and just adored it - Hard to put down. The ""coming of age"" twists and turns were just....a needed escape."
4,Sweetwater Creek,This is the first book I've read of Ms. Rivers and I enjoyed very much. It was a really good read.
3,Negative portrayal of southern women,"I enjoyed reading Sweetwater Creek until 3/4's into the novel. As I continued, and finished, I think her portrayal and use of the character Lulu and the response of the aunt to Lulu's rape and disappearance negatively reflects the southern culture. This makes for a good discussion for women who live in the South."
5,Great Summer Read,"There's nothing like summer and an Anne Rivers Siddons book. All that's needed is lemonade and sugar cookies. Another ARS novel ""Nora Nora"" had a child at the center of the book, and her latest has one, too. I was going through a rough time when I came upon this book, and it lifted my spirits and swept me away from my troubles. When a book does this, it is a special kind of magic. The inclusion of the animals was a nice touch as well. Highly recommended for a quick, satisfying read."
5,Sweetwater Creek,I've been a fan of Anne Rivers Siddons for years and again she wrote a book that keeps your interest. She's never predictable and always a great story. Loved it !
4,Another wonderful read from a fantastic writer,"Anne Rivers Siddons never fails to amaze. Her dense, colorful prose and insight into the human personality and frailties make for grand reads. Sweetwater Creek is no exception. Siddons' intricate portrait of the prepubescent Emily, her family and her friend LuLu and especially the Boykin Spaniels they raise is revealing of her understanding of the human condition and the ugliness it often raises. Don't miss this one; she's hit her mark again."
2,"Hokey, cliched, and the worst Ann Rivers Siddons book I've ever read","Let me start by saying that Anne Rivers Siddons is one of my very favorite authors, so I was excited to begin reading this. It was all I could do to finish this book--and I only did so it wouldn't be a waste of money. Many, many, eye-rolling moments, overly hokey dialogue and as usual, overly romantic descriptions of everything from the color of the creek mud to dogs to bugs. Emily might as well be a six year old child rather than an almost thirteen year old due to her extreme childishness, and LuLu emotes several times about how she'd just ""die"" if she had to leave Sweetwater Creek. This is an awful book, don't bother."
5,Anne Fan,"Enjoyed this one very much. Not on the level with Peachtree or Colony, but one of my best recent reads. Would definitely recommend to friends."
2,Spend your time on something more important,"My question throughout the book was ""Why?"". This was not a story that screamed to be written. There was no uplifting message or eye-opening resolve. I can't understand why a talented writer would waste her valuable time writing it or why I wasted my time reading it. The characters aren't sympathetic or real enough, the story manages to be syrupy and tawdry all at the same time, and the ending wasn't an ending - just more of same. It's not a bad book - it's just not a good one."
2,Horrendous dialog,"The plot was formulaic yet still mildly enjoyable, but whatreally put me off was the awful dialog. I never did actuallycount, but it felt like every page had at least 10 exclamationpoints on it, including at least one ""Hi!"" or ""Hey!"" Wherewas the editor on this book? I've read other books of hersand enjoyed them, but give this one a pass and go re-read""Gone with the Wind""."
5,Sweetwater Creek by Ann Rivers Siddons,"I didn't think she could write any book better than the last one. But this was one book I couldn't put down. She has the talent of pulling you in and making you live with the characters in her story. Anxiously awaiting her, hopefully, next one.Mary Pichette"
2,Great description; contrived characters,"Initially engaging but then disappointing. Anne Rivers Siddons provides beautiful descriptions of the natural events and settings of Sweetwater Creek in keeping with her usual style. However, the age gap and the abilities of her two female characters, Emily and Lulu, are stretched beyond credibility for their ages and stages."
1,"Uninteresting, boring, and disturbing.","This book is another example of how critics can make or break a book. Reading this book I was saddened and disgusted. I was most disturbed by the paragraph about a man, his genitals, and some vomit. Yes, that is what is in this book that has recieved such ""glowing"" reviews.This book should only be read by those who can stomach hours of boredom and depressing scenes and characters. I do not recommend this book to anyone, including people who have read the authors other works.Save your money, or go to a movie instead."
1,BORING -- Do Not Bother,"This was a book club pick or I would never have bothered finishing it. This should be a children's book it is so slow, boring and tame. Absolutely nothing happens -- at least nothing anyone over the age of 19 would consider interesting. The great dark secret is that a teenage girl likes primitive, raw sex?? Are you kidding me? Good grief! This should be put in the Young Adults section. Seriously."
2,Contrived and unlikely,"A truly disappointing book from a talented author. She writes from the point of view of a 12 year old who has decidedly middle aged thoughts and opinions. There is no logic to the plot or how the people react, also there are loose ends concerning a beloved relative's suicide and another relative's abandoming her child. Borrow from the library if you are tempted to read."
4,Sea Strike is good clean fun,"It is 2006 in the Straits of Formosa, Taiwan & Communist China are about to engage in mortal combat. Commander Amanda Lee Garrett & the crew of the USS CUNNINGHAM are sent out to prevent a Pacific Rim disaster. I liked this one a lot, thought about it for days although I won't read it again. Good imagery of future naval warfare. Great dialogue. Good characterizations. END"
1,needs a navy advisor,"I can't finish this book. Great character development, good interaction, pace of the action is appropriate. But the technical errors make it unreadable. This isn't just Tom Clancy's blunder of having an H-2 hover launch a torp in 'Red October', this is goof after goof after goof. I already ran out of sticky-notes, and barely got past midway. Too bad, likeable crew on the boat."
2,"Entertaining but typical ""John Wayne"" story","Firstly, I believe Mr. Cobb is probably a pseudonym for a female writer. It just had that feel from the writing. The good ol' USA saves the world yet again. However, certain aspects seemed horribly out of wack (i.e. ""0100hrs in the afternoon""???) and an infatuation for the word ""expedite"". The story was slick and the book was a decent read but the ""tactical"" plot was a definite stretch. I had a feeling that the Cunningham would be going up the Yangste after the first couple of chapters! and lo and behold up she went."
4,Interesting alternative to Clancy/Brown/Coonts,"This was the first book I've read by Cobb and I have to say I enjoyed it. It did get a little tedious at times (though not nearly to the extent that you find with Clancy) but I managed to make it thru. I do plan to go back and read the first book in the series, as well as the subsequent ones.The story was believable, as were the characters. The author also seemed to know his material. All in all, I enjoyed this book and look forward to more work by Cobb."
4,Sea Strike,"Really enjoyed this book. Good story tied around the action, and the female lead character, commanding a war ship was intriguing. Well done book. Anxious for next in series."
5,Love It,"Well, I did'nt think this was going to be as thrilling as Choosers of the Slain. Fortunately I was incorrect. I am an avid reader of adventure/thrillers, and this was one of the best that I have read to date. I have already preordered Sea Fighter and can't wait until it arrives. Great Work."
4,A good sea yarn,"If action on the high seas is your bag, check this book out. Here's a recommendation-- get Bob Mayer's EYES OF THE HAMMER for $3.99 here at Amazon-- if you like it, there are five more books in that special forces series. They're great books and the real deal-- we pass them around the team room here a lot."
5,Great sea story and follow up to Chosers of the Slain,"Sea Strike is a fast read for those who are interested in high tech naval battles of the future. It is written in Clancy style and continues the saga of Captain Amanda Garrett and the USS Cunningham. I enjoyed both books and look forward to the next episode. The Naval Technology is very accurate and up to date. As we say in the Navy ""Bravo Zulu"" (well done!)."
5,Fantastic Radar Detector,15 years of saving me from tickets and it's still working like the day I purchased it; incredible.I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
1,do not waste your money,"I bought 2 Passport Detector's 1-7500 & 1-8500 and both of these at the 1st beep you better be on the brakes,if not you may end up like me doing 86.1 in a 55 zone (i was in a rush) I will never buy a Passport again and yes i have own other brands but im selling both of them and im going to drive the speed limit from now on.The $140.00 ticket i had to pay with the 4 points i do not need (yes the cop lowered the speed on the ticket)and it was my 1st ticket in 16 years,my auto insurance is cheap and i want it to stay that way"
1,Highly speculative...,"Vasholz's inability to differentiate between fact and speculation skews the information presented in his book so much that this book is a disappointment to the scholarly world. Building off of unsupported initial assumptions, Vasholz's conclusions disintegrate under any serious scholarly evaluation. For instance, Vasholz claims to have proven that the Biblical authors were conscious of the idea of canonicity from the onset of writing the Hebrew Bible. However, this idea is poorly supported by four arguments that have connections to canonicity, but in no way prove canonicity. This book should not be used as a historical reference, and should instead be regarded as a conservative's attempt at unsubstantiated speculation."
2,"Good quality, but lack of features kills it","The leather is higher quality than most cell phone pouches, but this product is fairly useless to the average user. The magnetic clasp has to be seated *just* right or it doesn't hold. You can't use the phone when it is in the pouch. The thickness of the leather can muffle the vibrating alert to the point where you might not feel it. Lastly, while it says it is a ""large"" pouch, the phone will not fit if it has a battery larger than the factory provided one."
5,More beautiful and amusing than any other physics lesson,"The Super String Theory in a manga? Only Fujishima sensei would try to pull this off -- and actually be able to do it. This is the real deal, I had my physics obsessed sister verify for me, so you actually can argue that you're studying while reading manga! Besides this little lesson, Terrible Master Urd is full of the incredibly gorgeous art you can expect from Fujishima sensei. The story does have some very humorous elements to it, but this is a deeply dramatic tale. The ending is so sweet and the insight we get into the characters is really wonderful. You'll be glad you have the graphic novel and can read without stopping because this is truly a page-turner."
4,More outstanding work!,"This is the latest installment in the Oh My Goddess series, and a fine piece of work. Fujishima's style improves with every outing. There is less humour in this book than previous ones, but the coherent storyline makes up for it."
4,"A good listen, even after the years","This CD seemingly doesn't age. The words are simple and clear, the melodies fiery or melancholy, the sound always unmistakeably Celtic without completely forswearing modern instruments. A shame they decided to program the drums instead of getting a live drummer!"
4,Globe Trekker - Tahiti & Samoa,"The DVD captured most of the exquisitness of Tahiti & Samoa. Ian is a very entertaining trekker. I had hoped to see a little bit more of French Polynesia, such as the Marquesas Islands, but overall it was an exceptional program."
5,Hours of entertainment.,"All of the Adventures in Odessey are very good. I purchased this one for my son's birthday. He will be twelve. Haven't heard it yet because his birthday hasn't come yet. Cause and Effect is an excellent album. And if you want your kids to really become familiar with the Bible, I recommend the Bible Eyewitness series.(Hall of Faith and Collector's Set)My children listen to these in the car on long trips, which where we live, is every trip."
5,Hugo by Hugo Boss for Women Toilette Spray,"This is a nice spray perfume. The scent stays on longer that others. My husband liked it, too.My teenage daughter snuck some when I wasn't looking. I liked the price, too."
5,Hugo for Women,My experience in ordering from Amazon was excellent. The product arrived in a timely manner. Thank- you
2,not too good,"At very first spritz, its not so bad, smells like fresh flowers.But then...as it settles on you throughout the day, it just smells like dead flowers.It gives off this really unpleasant smell after being on the skin.I don't recommend buying it."
3,Not sure about this product,"This is a great perfume, and I will not be returning it, but the bottle appears to have been a tester. As in the actual amount of perfume in the bottle seems low, as if its been used up some. Very strange. At any rate, I might not order from this vendor again, but the product is authentic and its a wonderful scent."
5,Fantastic Gift for her,I think this is one of the best perfume I bought for my wife. She loves it and I like the frangrance too.
4,entregado a tiempo,entrega puntual y en muy buen estado el producto es de buena calidad hasta el momento es un buen servicio
4,Magnets could be stronger.,"I purchased these for work where we do a lot of filing. I bought an extra and was glad I did. The magnets do not hold at all, after a few files it got too heavy and slid down the side of the filing cabinet. One eventually hit the floor and broke in half. I have since purchased adhesive strips and they work much better."
5,Brilliant start to learning calligraphy!!!!,"This book teaches you a basic form of hebrew calligraphy, and then shows you different types of fonts. It also teaches you how to hold the pen, how to draw lines in angles and degrees, and how to erase mistakes.This book is very helpful, and perfect for a beginner. A********"
5,Good beginner book,"This book was exactly what I needed to get started with Hebrew Calligraphy. He explains all the basics, and the foundational hand style has been easy to understand. Once you learn the foundational hand, you can move on to more difficult styles."
1,This CD is really horrible!!,"I have many free copies of this cd. It is horrible. Really, really awful stuff. Can't believe anyone would pay for this crap."
4,Charbroil Spice Stick,"Gave this for my grilling sons for Christmas, it will work well for their grilling needs."
3,An all right product,Got this for a gift. It is alright. One of the interlocking containers is missing a nub so it tends to be loose or falls off.
3,good basic design,"It is a great concept, except no easy way to mark the type of spices. Also the shaker lids on 2 of the bottles are so small that salt barely can come through the holes. The only thing that closes the containers is securing to the container on top of it."
2,Price is a bit high,"Rachael Ray magazine had an article that listed this as costing $20 which is a lot more reasonable than this listed price. Looks like a good idea, but not for this price."
3,Hard to season,"Hard to season these pans and even harder to keep it seasoned. I tried all recommended methods. You have to spend hours, and numerous times to really achieve a black surface. Then it is good, but for couple of months. Then black patina starts to peel away. I assume heat control is important, but different receipes require different heat intensity. I definetely prefer cast iron over these. One more negative, food and oil gets stuck at handle point-not very higene.Now positives- good heat retention, it feels sturdy in hand."
2,Olympus Camedia Lens Adapter,"I got this adapter because I found it cheaper than Olympus' version, the CLA-1 adapter. However, when I put it on my C-3040, I found most of the pictures I took demonstrated vignetting (hazy shadows around the edges). Despite the fact that this adapter did physically fit on my lens, it did not do the job I needed it to do. I have since returned it and purchased the CLA-1 adapter and have had not problems with it yet."
2,Two Stars for the Two-Star General,"Not a very compelling read. The plot moves in a strictly linear direction with a bunch of green berets and an insufferable two-star general miraculously escaping from one close call after another. The story is so predictible that it lacks any excitement. The characters are stereotypical. This is not a ""timely and imaginative military thriller"" as one back cover blurb would have you believe. It's a wannabe screenplay in search of a producer. It might make a good movie, but as a book it's AWOL."
1,Not worth the space on your bookshelf,"Don't waste your money. Despite the fact it was a very fast and easy read, misspellings, factual errors, and odd jumps in the flow of the storyline resulted in this one going in the garbage. I wouldn't wouldn't even consider giving it to someone else to read."
5,Delicious Crackers,This review is for Annie's Homegrown White Cheddar Bunnies that I buy in a Pack of 12 boxes. These little crackers are about the size of PF fish but much better. I often take a box of these on picnics and share. Everyone who has ever tried them love them. They are much more economical bought through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program and we don't run out of our favorite snack.
2,Messy Bunnies,"I thought I would enjoy these bunnies much more than I did. Instead, I didn't care for them. I was not a fan of the flavor and the cheese powder on the crackers is messy and gross. I do not plan to buy these again; however, I will never stop buying theAnnie's Homegrown Organic Snack Mix, Bunnies, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)--they're delicious!!"
1,Annie's Homegrown White Cheddar Bunnies,"These are god awful crackers, thay dont taste like anything close to white cheddar, they taste like a flavorless cracker. I am upset that I wasted my money on these nasty things. I love annies products but this is not a winner in my book. I have heard that the sour cream and onion are the best so I am going to give those a try next but word of warning, buy one box at a store first before purchasing online, you will be glad you did. The big reason I love annies so much is everything they make is sutibale for vegetarians, meaning they use renetless free cheese so thats why I love them."
3,"Good, tho very basic info...","This is decent but very basic info. Doesn't cover any real details or how they operate. I was really disappointed. If you want a light overview, this is for you, if you want details and specifics, look elsewhere."
3,avdaycare,"great book for centers & pre-schools, but for my small family childcare (infant/nursery) I found it did not have NEAR enough focus or information directed towards newborns and crawlers, specifically nap, changing & eating areas or indoor floor play.if you have an older crowd (30 months +) then yes, this would be a good idea resource for you, however I like my baby-babies...I DID get a couple outside-play ideas for my 18-24 month olds, but for me personally--simply not enough to justify the cost."
5,Wow!,This book transformed everything I had in my head into my classroom. I was inspired-motivated and could not put it down. I raved about it to my co-workers and encouraged them to go out and get it just by how I was implementing it into my classroom. If I ever have the chance to go hear Deb Curtis speak I will jump at the opportunity.
1,What the &!*#,"Up until now, I have always thought Joy Fielding a fabulous author whose stories are full of suspense and mystery. This is no more that a Danielle Steele type romance novel. What a disappointment."
2,Rather mindless drivel,"I really wanted to like this book. The characters were conflicted and angst ridden and complex, just the sort of meaty characters to sink your teeth into. The author describes everyday scenes well and weaves a fascinating situation. Alas, however, I just can't suspend my disbelief quite that much. I just didn't find the outcome of the book to be realistic. I like a tear jerker as much as the next person but there is a point at which it has to make some amount of sense. I would recommend this as a good rainy Sunday read, but only for those with a hearty imagination."
4,HOW COULD I HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THIS GREAT AUTHOR,I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH OF THIS BOOK IT REALLY HIT HOME ABOUT SOMEONE BEING SICK AND STICKING WITH YOU THROUGH THICK AND THIN AND HOW A FAMILY FINALLY COMES TOGETHER TO HELP THE VICTIM DURING HER TIME OF NEED- I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT JOY FIELDING HAVING READ SOME OF HER BOOKS A LONG TIME AGO- WHEN I SAW THIS I BOUGHT IT AND FINISHED IT IN THREE DAYS READ IT YOU WONT BE SORRY-
2,No raves here,"I could not have sympathy for the "" moral heroine"" who was being cheated on by her husband over and over again and then ended up rolling in the hay with another man herself. You'll like this one if you like sex and assisted suicide. The author seems to paint them both with a flowery brush. This was the first book I read by Fielding and I think I'll pass on her others."
2,A recommendation for euthanasia!,"If you want to read a book that romanticizes killing your daughter because she has a terminal illness -- this is probably it!I found the whole premise unsettling and simplistic. There is a lack of moral foundation for the whole story.First, the book focuses on a faithless husband; then it moves on to a child who has her first experience of sex in her own home when her parents are gone. Finally, in a poorly contrived subplot, the ""heroine"" convinces her mother to kill her when ""it's time.""The book is written to sell. And it has! So I assume that the author achieved her goals.It is basically a shallow and romanticized portray of euthanasia. I do not recommend this book."
3,Worth reading,"This book is surprisingly good. It is well-written, the characters are well-developed and the plot is very real and believable. The ending reflects reality in that it isn't all flowers and sunshine. There are many hearstring moments so keep your tissues handy. Worth reading."
3,The First Time,"I just finished this book and I thought it was ok but not as good as some of her earlier books. I loved See Jane Run etc. This book just didn't grab me. Yes it is a sad story of an illness and how a family copes and the love it requires to live through something like ALS, but it feft contrived. Very explicit sex which I had not remembered from her other books."
2,"Great if you're into ""Lifetime"" type stories","Unfortunately, I cannot give this book the same rave review as others have given it. Though it helped to pass the time on a trip, the story wasn't very plausible, the characters were generally not very likable or smart and, in the end, I wasn't really rooting for anyone except the fact that I was finally finished. This is in no way harsh criticism of the author; the writing was more than adequate, it was the story I wasn't too fond of. I think this just isn't my genre. My mom is way into the movies shown on the ""Lifetime"" network; with a cheating husband, dying wife and bratty, rebelious teenage daughter this story seems tailor-made for the ""channel for women""."
4,WONDERFUL,"After trying to get into a few crime/suspense novels, I picked up 'The First Time' just for something different and was blown away as to what an excellent book this was.Mattie Hart has spent her entire marriage turning a blind eye to her husbands unfaithfulness and is slowly falling apart. After a few strange happenings and feelings, she is diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, a crippling disease that eventually is fatal.Her husband, feeling guilty, returns home to help her and look after his teenage daughter. Basically, this book is very thin on plot, but it isn;t the plot that makes this story interesting, it is the three main characters, that make this book unforgettable and un-put-down-able!Even though the story rushes toward a tragic ending, it is the emotion, psychology and dialogue that will have the reader glued to the book.I definately recommend this book if you are after something that will stay with you and is superbly written.Well done, Ms Fielding!"
4,Wonderful Read,"I read this book after reading Grand Avenue (which was wonderful). This book was also great. If I could give it 4 1/2 stars, I would. It was very emotional and touching. Fielding has a true talent for displaying deep emotions. I will remember this book for a very long time."
4,It is worth reading but....,I gave it 4 stars because i didn't think it was as good as this author usually writes. I would still say it was a good read just didn't meet with the usual quality.
5,Get out the tissues! This book is wonderful!,"I definitey recommend this book if you can handle sad books. If you can't, then don't read this one. I cried the whole last 10 or 15 pages. And I don't mean just tears in your eyes, be ready to sob!You will come to love Mattie as you feel you know her personally. The author gets so intimate and takes you into the book with her that you really feel like you are a part of this story. The whole book is a roller coaster of emotions that will leave you a sobbing mess.I love an author that can tap into your emotions like that, therefore I loved this book!!"
5,Same Part,"This item was exactly the same as the old part and it does the same function. Quick ship, well wrapped."
2,Articles are good....,"The articles are good, and some of the explanation too. HOWEVER, the sexual adventures or leanings of the anthropologists whose articles are presented here are irrelevant to the text. WHY must that be a focus instead of the theory itself? These remarks were inserted by the authors of the textbook, and unless I am studying about the actual life of the anthropologist, how is this pertinent? Stick to the theory and leave the drama to Hollywood."
2,theories are confusing,theories are very hard to understand especially when 60%...maybe even 70% of the authors in this book speak like ancient times. where their english and vocabulary are superb!
4,Good book for Anthropology Theory,I bought this for my Theory in Anthropology class. It gives a good background of the theory of major contributors to cultural anthropological theory.
3,a different kind of boxing movie,"Boxing films:We've seen it all before...it's Rocky Balboa, over and over again. Here's a breath of fresh air- a true story about a real champion. Jon Favreau is terrific as Rocky Marciano, who seemed to be a really nice guy who took care of his friends and family. I watched this film not knowing anything about Rocky Marciano other than the fact that he was a boxer, and this film did a good job at educating me, without ever being sappy or boring."
1,No sock in the Rock (Y),"Just watched this film. John Favreau Man he was AWFUL, Is this really the guy who directed ""Cowboys & Aliens?"" He didn't even try to study the real Mariano's speeach patterns or his mannerisims. I blame the director Winkler on this, The guy should stick to being a producer as his films as a director STINK! They tried to be Raging Bull instead it was RAGING BS!The boxing scenes were laughable. The music by Stanley Clark was over dramatic. Which is a shame as he is a terrific bass guitarist.I best stop and wash my eyes out after seeing this gold plated pile of pooh. It was the worst boxing film I'd seen in my life. Oh Boy!"
3,The real Rocky,"Rocky Marciano was a real life hero when I was a boy and this movie does justice to that memory. Starting from humble beginning, Rocky escapes the fate of his father (played by a believable George C Scott in his final role). This drive to escape the shoe factory and make something of himself becomes his driving force in life. Ultimately it becomes his undoing as develops an obcession with wealth. This very real human aspect of the story seperates it from the standard genre of a boxer pulling himself up by his bootstraps. The interplay and collision of Rocky with Joe Louis gives this tale greater depth. The film is understated, ironic, touching and well worth watching"
4,Great shoe,I bought this shoe for my husband who is normally a 10 1/2 so I got him an 11 just to be safe and they were still kinda tight so my advice is this shoe runs just a bit smaller especially if u have a wider foot
4,Good Shoes,These shoes were very stiff when I first got them but they broke in quickly.Good pair to play in.
1,"Way too small, especially narrow.","I knew the second I took them out of the box that they were too narrow, and looked a bit too short as well ( I wear a 14). Once I tried them on (with dress socks) and struggled mightily, I knew golf socks would not work, and they were simply too small in every way to play. I would plan on them being this way for you as well and either order a bigger size and width, or get another shoe."
2,manufactures defect,"I had to return the shoes after wearing them just two times, because they did not live up to the water proof waranty."
4,"Nice shoes, slow shipping","The shoes look good and comfortable. I have worn them for about half a dozen times now. The size is right because I have another Nike Air, so I just ordered the same size as my other Nike Air. The price is right. This is my first pair of golf shoes so I don't want to break the bank.The shipping was slow, though. I purchased it from Amazon. I had to call Amazon's customer service 1 week after I placed the order in order to find out why the item has not been shipped yet. After my call, the item was shipped the next day. I was disappointed with Amazon that the item was not shipped right away. It took about a week to start shipping even though the item was in stock in Amazon's warehouse. It took about 2 weeks to get the item."
2,Didn't like the fit...,Shoes do not fit like traditional Nike golf shoes... almost felt defective. Ended up giving them away because they were so uncomfortable the first time I wore them on the field. Would not recommend.
5,Great deal!,I purchased these as a surprise for my boyfriend and he loves them. Says they are very comfy and have even improved his golf. The smile on his face when he opened them was worth all 5 stars!!
2,A step backwards,"The topics covered in this book are very good. It is a good reference book for mechanical engineering students doing an intermediate course in turbomachinery. However, due to the numerous typing errors, the 3rd edition is actually a better book. It makes it very challenging to follow, especially for students. Also, the theory is sometimes rather cryptic and one can do with a bit more detail in places. The velocity triangles can definitely do with more detail. The section on nozzles and diffusers is good, albeit a bit short."
4,No problems,Needed this for some extra text for a class. So far it's been helpful: glad I got it here!
1,I hope you have his phone number,"This was the worst book on rotating machinery that I ever picked up. Hard to follow and poorly organized, perhaps designed for the intended course work, I would not recommend that it as any reference value.His flat theory also neglects changes in units. Which he uses outside of his own definitions in the prologue."
4,A very complete textbook,"We were asked to buy this book by a teacher, it was certainly a good choice, perhaps the information given is too dense but I did enjoy studying with it."
5,Just amazing!,"When I first heard ""Lord of the Fields"" I couldn't stop listening. I've have never played a song so many times. It got me through a very difficult time in my life. When I play it in the car, my 12-year old son forgets himself and sings along. Thank Michael Kelly Blanchard for sharing his talent with the world."
4,"dated now, but used to be the best","As a filmmaker getting into sound design, this was the best book to own. Learned more from this book than I did in my sound design classes. But Pro Tools has changed so much now, there needs to be an updated edition."
1,Good but OUTDATED - please save your money,"This book was written in 2003, and whereas it gives a pretty solid THEORETICAL overview of using ProTools in film, video and multimedia settings, and some historical background on audio/video synchronization, it is not at all useful for hands-on modern day applications. Personally, I have resorted to online / streaming instruction (or interactive DVD instruction) at any number of places on the web (search for pro tools tutorials)."
3,"Entertaining, but boring aswell","I love the NBA, I love watching great moments, however the majority of these presentation is in the old days. The Celtics of old who won 11 titles were great, but I thought there would be a balanced amount of modern champs too. Still good dvd to add to your collection, but not the greatest as the title would suggest."
1,Don't even bother.,I DONT AGREE WITH THE #1 CHOICE. AND THEY ONLY SHOW THE TOP 10 PLAYS--THEY DONT EVEN SHOW THE OTHERS. THEY ARE JUST LISTED. IN 75 MINUTES ONLY 10 PLAYS? LAME.
1,I've never been so dissapointed in my LIFE!,"Normally, I LOVE Andrew Lloyd Webber's music. I've bought many CD's featuring his work, so when I saw this collection at the music store, I was pretty excited ""A DOUBLE CD??? For 20 bucks? Oh yeah!"" I thought it would good esp. when I saw it said ""stars of the london stage."" So imagine my reaction when I put it into my CD player once I got home and starting listening to it...the performers on this CD SLAUGHTER many of Webbers greatest songs. The musicians were fine, its the SINGERS that ruin it. For example ""Think of Me"" sung by Lesley Garrett doesn't even SOUND like the song! The end where she goes up the scale is suppossed to be POWERFUL, and OPERATIC, NOT lazily swooning!Have these performers ever actually PERFORMED this music? I am aghast that I wasted 20 dollars on this CD...and KICKING myself for it too."
4,Some songs better than the US version,"The main reason I like this set is because it has the London casts singing. I find the tone of both Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford to be shrill at times, and the London Phantom singers are much better. Sharon Campbell is no spring chicken, but she has a depth to her voice that is lovely. Also, instead of the way so many of the Broadway singers belt out the tunes, there's a restraint here that fits some of the songs much better, from most of the singers."
4,A good value,"Basically two disks for the same price as a lot of the other one disk Andrew Lloyd Webber collections. Contains a nice selection of songs from the expected shows (Jesus Christ Superstar to Evita to Cats to Phantom to Sunset Blvd). A good value for somebody who would like two hours of great songs. My only complaint - I wish there were more songs from ""Cats""."
4,Psychological Twists Abound,"This novel is definately on the surface, no pun intended, a psychological novel about the fractured mind of a young woman searching for her father in a rural part of Canada. Atwood's metaphors and imagery make this book so much more exciting than just that synopsis. Her main character reverts back to nature as her mind tries to deal with psychological onslaughts from many different factors in her world. The text is challenging, but it is just experimental enough to keep the reader engaged. You'll definately need to reread this one to capture all its subtleties."
1,Dreary Dreck,"I'll never forget how much I hated this book, a miserable read that stands as a yardstick to measure everything I hate in fiction. Because my first Atwood novel was the masterful ""A Handmaid's Tale"", I eagerly sought out a replay of that unforgettable book by reading her first really acclaimed work. Reading this thin volume felt like a lifetime's penance for every novel I have ever enjoyed. Some self-conscious, dated, impressionistic, terribly indulgent rumination on the injustice of life for the modern woman, by finishing it I learned a valuable lesson, namely what it is that I hate in a novel. Read ""A Handmaid's Tale""."
2,The boring world of a stereotype,"Margaret Atwood is an excellent writer, but this book is not quite it. The characters are too stereotypical and he plot is pretty repetitive. I know Atwood pretended to make a feminist statement, but it isn't accompanied with a good narrative. Probably it is only for femenine or existencialist readers."
3,Lost me toward the end.,"I like Margaret Atwood -- after reading LADY ORACLE, I wanted to read this book, especially after having seen parts of the movie years ago.While Ms. Atwood is a fine writer, she really lost me toward the end of the book. Her prose had become so arcane and abstruse that I simply couldn't make it throught the last few chapters. Also, the action unfolds WAY too slowly: Just when the main character (I can't remember her name now) is about to happen upon an important clue concerning her father's disappearance, the action veers off to another direction. It's as if Ms. Atwood had a bad case of ADD while writing this book.I think the main character's father's body was found at the bottom of that bay or whatever body of water was close at hand --I THINK. I was so lost and confused at that point that I had lost all track of what was happening. This would have been a much more effective novel if it were faster-paced and not hampered by such cumbersome prose."
2,"Stylistic work of art, but a bit misanthropic","I am not satisfied with this book. I find it too narrow-minded and cynical. At some parts it even supports hatred, eg (speaking about people in general) 'I wanted ...a machine... that would evaporate them...that way there would be more room for the animals.' (end of 18th Ch). Though this may be just a phase in protagonist's development I just couldn't empathize with her. Otherwise I liked her style of writing and I got quite involved with the protagonist in some passges. But, I disapprove of exaggerations in this novel."
3,"Interesting imagery, weak plot.","This book reads more like someone's journal - a bunch of random, deep observations about the world. You really can ""feel"" the main character's emotions as she goes on her inner journey, but the journey itself is somehow not very intriguing."
1,boring and pretentious,"A very disappointing and awfully boring novel. Almost all the characters are flat, the language desultory and the plot painfully viscous.To all those of you who seem to think that you have to either love this novel or else you didn't grasp the full depths of it : i can well see the depths Atwood AIMED at (just as her ""Survival"" project of establishing a genuine Canadian literature is rubbed in on every single page!), but I think she fails to convey them convincingly by literary means.The fact that she wrote it in 1972 may be an excuse for the overabundant psychoanalytic, feminist and nationalist elements in it, but it is no excuse whatsoever for the poor literary quality of this novel, which claims a lot more than it can keep.Highly pretentious and not recommendable."
1,What???,"If this was a mystery, where was any kind of suspense? This was about coming to terms with an unwanted abortion. Was she ever married? Does anyone care? She started unravelling from page 172 onward; why then? I felt this book was a waste of precious reading time."
1,Profoundly overated work with limited appeal,"I was forced to read this for a feminist theories class and almost fell asleep during several portions of the book, as well as our class discussion. While part of the assignment is the teacher's fault (insisting on standard English for assingments while touting this book) I really do not think anybody should have to be subjected to such a horrid arrangement.Having previously heard about Ms. Atwood's writing from numerous feminist friends who were active in the second wave, I really wanted to give her work a chance, and thus was disappointed by the style. Since we already know the protagonist is trying to sort her life out and come to grips with a past abortion, the language structure only produces a giant headache--especially for those on tight academic assignment deadlines.This book would be okay for leisiure reading, but under no circumstances should be expected reading for a two week (or less period)."
2,don't read the cover,"For those of you in love with metaphors this is for you. Personally, I don't want to work so hard to get through a novel. After reading Alias, Grace by Margaret Atwood, I thought I had a winner with this book. I spent so much time re-reading her pages as my mind would drift. I still have 40 pages to go and I am seriously considering throwing in the towel. I have the feeling the narrator is going to wake and everything is going to be a dream. I was attracted to the book's description, and maybe that was my first mistake."
5,Thank you!!,"Love the Notes that are added to this novel, helps me a lot with the fact that there is another persons opinon on top of my own on what Margaret Atwood's ideas are exclusively about."
3,Hollow characterizations,"Though I found this book to contain some haunting and beautiful passages such as ""Language divides us into fragments,"" and ""I was not prepared for the average, its needless cruelties and lies,"" ultimately, the narrator lacked depth. A story led by a woman who is essentially numb makes for a souless read. Rather than coming to dislike or admire her for any solid reason, I felt her to be lifeless, and therefore, I felt little throughout."
5,A true classic of Canadian Literature,"I am only beginning to explore Canadian Literature. I began with Ostenso's Wild Geese, and now I am discovering Atwood. Surfacing was a great novel because it delivers the issues of preservation of the Canadian identity. The narrator worries about the Americanization of her childhood town and brings up questions of survival of Canadian patriotism. I also enjoyed the liberated nature of the narrator with her refusal to fit into the mold of the expectations of women in those days."
5,Tipsy Smoothies: Over 150 Fabulous Cocktail Smoothie Recipes,"I haven't had a chance to try any of the recipes yet, but looking through the delicious recipes, I can tell they are really fantastic, or should I say ""Fabulous."" The book has lots of info regarding techniques, freezing fruit and even types of glasses. Very nice and can't wait to actually taste some of these creations."
3,disappointing,The cassette player doesn't play or record tapes very well at all. I was very disappointed and I don't know how to go about fixing the problem as the product was a gift from my children and the packaging has been discarded.
2,"Fine, except radio has gone out for good","I tried to fix the radio and even called the company a couple times, but it only plays one station. A good bargin, but half the reason we bought it has now been taken away. Not really worth the purchase, (or time.)"
2,Disappointed,"Emerson MS9923TTR Home Audio System with 5 CD Changer, 3-Speed Turntable, AM/FM Stereo Radio, Digital Tuning, Dual Cassettes, and Remote ControlUnfortunatly, the 1st system's tuner no longer worked after 2 weeks. Amazon exchanged the product, but the 2nd's tuner also ceased to function after 2 days. Everything else works fine, so I just use another radio when I want to listen. No point in continuing to exchange a defective product. On the plus side, it does have a turntable which is very hard to find."
5,GREAT!,"VeggieTales is one of the best videos I know for children. The soundtrack to this wonderful video lives up to every one of my expectations! I recommend this for anyone, but especially for those who have children and want them to learn the values they need for everyday life."
3,A collection of essays about Walt Disney and Disney Corp.,The essays included in this book cover many different aspects of Walt Disney and his Corporation. Some of the essays written are very negative. The editor appears to have a person adgenda in compiling the essays he included
3,Great Wire Wheel,"I use this wide wire wheel with my DeWalt grinder. It doesn't fit with the side case on, but that's ok it's still usable with it off. Some of the wires have to be trimmed with a wire cutter as they either stick out too far from the circumference and also the sides of the wheel, but when finished it works perfectly...no wobble and in balance with the DeWalt high torque grinder. The width of this wheel is better than the normal width of other wheels; more wire surface area. I recommend it.Now, it is October 2012, and this wheel is so out of balance it literally shakes my table horribly. I guess after about 1 year of usage, it has a tendency to shift off center, too bad because it is still in good shape......just wobbles really bad now."
3,just my luck,"unfortunately the one I recieved is out of balance and causes a lot of vibration when it reaches full speed.I put the old wire wheel back on and had no problems and proved it's a problem with this new wheel. Since I don't leave my bench grinder on when not in use it's not that big a deal.other than the vibration, it works perfectly and I would have given it 5 stars."
1,'this is a song stolen from Celine Dion'...,"This is U2 after all, and there's a stadium to fill, and there's a Grammy to win, and there's a Rock star attitude to sell, etc. Milking the same bass line and the same guitar trick for about five albums, and the world just pretend to love it again just because 'it's U2' - everybody's know it's cool to be a U2 fan, that's fashionable, and surely some of your female friends love U2, so it's better to like them, and the mass media must be nice with them, because they have the money, etc - , and it's the biggest pile of s**t I've ever heard!'.U2 are just old dinosaurs whom sell their name alone. I really don't know how the hell this pathetic attempt at ballad can be number 1 in the UK at the moment!....and the Grammy goes to...U2!..."
1,My Heart Will Go On 2,"This is the worst song U2 has ever recorded. It's awful, rotten, boring and annoying. I absolutely hate this overhyped song. Nowhere near 'One', 'With Or Without You', 'Stay', 'If God Will Send His Angels', etc"
1,What a dreadful song !!!,"I can't believe this is a single. Bono's worst songwriting ever. One of his worst vocal performances as well. Extremely corporate plastic radio hit, it's truly freaked. Moreover, you can notice all those silly 'epic' overdubs weren't played at real time. As artificial as the song itself. 'how wonderful this song is, about Bono and his father, lovely'... Bono could write about their greedy coporate relationship with iPod and Apple Tunes and that's still would be nice for some fans !. Shame on some blinded fans.I really felt embarresed when I had to listen to this dull 'song'.By the way, the cover art is 'so emotional' as well, right ?..."
1,WHAT A BEAUTIFUL IPOD ITEM,"Just take a look at the cover... a sellout band dressed up with so much expensive clothes, plus a $400 Bono's sunglasses. All that captured by an artificial shot. If that's 'emotive' then Steve Jobs bussiness are emotive as well. I can imagine Bono laughing at all you, 'sensitive' fans. He knew that using his father's cancer death thing this crappy synthesized lame ballad would be heartbreaker and Grammy worthy.Don't get me wrong, I DO LIKE U2, but if you want me to recomend you a ballad, go with 'Promenade', 'MLK', 'With Or Without You', 'Running To Stand Still', 'Mothers Of The Dissapeared', 'Heartland', 'All I Want Is You', 'One', 'Love Is Blidness', 'Stay', 'The First Time', 'If God Will Send His Angels', 'Please', 'Miss Sarajevo', etc, etc.This garbage is as bad as 'The Hands That Built America'. Sorry but that's the truth. Surely 5 stars fans will love that shameful cliché video as well."
1,Sometimes you can't write a decent song Bono,"What does ""A truly U2 fan"" means?. If that means being a dumb silly blinded brianwashed fan who must love every little overhyped U2 item at the first sight, well, then I'm not a Truly U2 fan.This is simply the worst piece of crap I've ever heard. Bono's voice is awful, listening to it is like bangin your head against a brick wall. Bono has become in an awful cynic. Living in his Huge House made of Gold, then can cry that poor africans deserve better, of course they deserve help, BUT why dose he not give them his VAST amounts of money? Because he is a hypocrit.I can't stand this piece of corporate garbage, pseudo-emotional, for easy ears and fragile minds. Even Christina Aguilera has better ballads than this ipod crap. By the way, ""Very touching video!""."
1,One step closer to U2's death,"If they lost fans from the iPod debacle, more fans turned away after this sorry effort. Once again, U2 were allowed into the mainstream in order to sell U2's legacy on iTunes, cover Magazines, Grammy Awards, etc. Extremely large disappointment, this is their worst ballad ever. Period.Please, U2 just go away and never return...IN THE NAME OF LONG-TIME FANS"
5,What a book! Where's the next one?,You can really just see Ms. Chance growing as an author in leaps since the first book. The plotline was engaging and the suspense was so well integrated that I didn't even notice it right away! I couldn't put the book down and am overly antsy for the next one. The character development was commendable and overall it is definitely worth all the praises/blurbs you read about it. Grab this one. It's already on my favorite shelf.
4,Continuing to be a Paranormal Mash-Up,"This book is like a bad casserole. Everything you ever heard about in the paranormal genre is here messing around and making a conglomerationthat is not only hard to swallow, but annoys the mental digestion. So we got a friendly ghost over here, an unfriendly golem over there, we gotcha' basic dark fae and light fae, we got houses that fly like in the Wizard of Oz and of course, vampires and too many war mages too count. But what we don't have is a plausible story line that one can follow in any kind of linear fashion. We don't have a clear vision of who the bad guys/good guys are and finally, why the heck do we care about any of these people? Where are the EDITORS out there?? Still, I was interested enough to buy this book and the next one--so cha-ching--who's the bigger fool?"
2,What happened to Cassie?,"The first book was very good. She was strong,smart,and street wise. What happen to her in the second book? She became a fraidy cat with a meandering story line that was kinda of boring. I didn't even finish the book because it really wasn't going anywhere. I'll wait and read reviews before I think about buying the third one. Hopefully, Cassie will find herself, but I am gone."
3,Happy Ending??,Not at all sastified with the writing of this second part of Cassandra. Truly I felt like blah throughout the whole reading until almost the end. Not as good as the first and Cassandra in this book shied alot from accepting herself and that can and will become infuriating when you wish she would just break down and be what could become a great character. It is a well written read and some parts are interesting but if you read the first you definitely might want to skip the second.
3,Not so intertained,"I did not read the first book, but I picked this one up because it looked good. I just did not get into it like I normally do with books of this genre. The main character just seemed whiney to me. I could see no real reason that she wouldn't want to accept her power. Maybe it is explained in the first book. The shifting through time was interesting as well as the Dracula references. Over all I counsider this book ok and I will not read the others in the series."
3,ehh,"i just finished this book the other day and i have to say, compared to the first book in the series, it was just ok. i'll have to agree with other reviewers that cassandra has become boring and whiny and not able to take care of herself. there were so many times in the book where i wanted to materialize in her world and slap her. she kept just making incredibly wrong decisions, especially towards the end.i would say, read the book if you liked the first one, because it's not awful. i'd just maybe get it from the library instead of buying it."
5,Claimed By Shadow (Cassandra Palmer),"Claimed by Shadow (Cassandra Palmer, Book 2)Another of the vampire series with Cassandra Palmer as the hapless and sometimes clueless pawn the vampire court. With her protector Mircea and her mage she works to get control of the powers she has to fulfill her role as the Pythia of the Temple of Apollo. The book is interesting as Casse goes from one spot to another as she moves toward her goal of just staying alive. Lots of humor and a very fun read."
3,"Disappointing, but I expected a lot.","I'm not going to give a summary either....plenty have already done that, and have done it very well. I'm just going to share my thoughts. If possible I'd give it a 3 stars. It was readable, but I have to agree with some of the others that the story didn't progress as much as I would have liked. I thought the first book, Touched the Dark was great, and I was hopefully that this would be another great series, but now I'm a bit wary. I was very much looking forward to Claimed by Shadow but I think it fell short, and to be honest I'm disappointed. Is it unreadable? No, it was okay. Will I read the 3rd book (I'm assuming there will be one)? Yes. BUT...If the 3rd book falls as short as Claimed by Shadow...I think I'll give up on Karen Chance."
2,Just not as good as other series,"I usually love these kinds of series, but after forcing myself to plow through the first two books, I don't think I'll be reading any more of this series. The characters lack depth, but to make up for that it seems like the author has decided to throw them at the reader in droves. The plot is minimal and is overshadowed by the constant, disjointed action. It never grabbed my imagination."
1,Unfortunately...,"I read ""Touch the Dark"" and initially was thoroughly unimpressed. However, as a general personal rule when reading a new book series I will go ahead and read the 2nd book, even if the first one is bad...a sort of ""benefit of the doubt"" type thing.Unfortunately after reading the first two pages of ""Claimed by Shadow"" I was again thoroughly unimpressed AND underwhelmed.It is the author's style of writing that is off-putting to me. I find it to be erratic, inconsistent, and suffering greatly from lack of cohesion. It's hard for me to really get into the story when it does not seem to have any kind of ""flow"".I will try to finish ""Claimed by Shadow"" so as not to be a quitter and all, but after this book I do believe I am done with this author. :-("
5,Funny and Dark- My Favorite Combo,"Hands-down the best fantasy-romance with a slightly, but not obnoxiously, dark and twisted sense of humor I've read recently. It's the aspect of Laurell Hamilton's early books that I miss so much in her current stuff, and in most of her heirs in the dark fantasy and vampire romance genres.Undead Elvis was missing half his cranium during his act and the women in the audience DIDN'T NOTICE! The King was amusing, but the description of the audience was so much funnier. Plus the fact that a secondary character kept giving the heroine drinks throughout the scene because the alcohol would help with the after-effects of dimensional travel...I thought it was great. Can't wait for the next book."
3,Indecisiveness with Mystic Backgrounds,"In book one, Cassie was smart, savvy, and running for her life. In book two she is still running for her life, but she doesn't know what's going on. On the whole, I believe a protagonist with a clue is more fun than one without one. The supporting cast from 'Touch the Dark' is still here, but with switched around loyalties that aren't always well explained. I liked the first volume better, but the second isn't that much worse. 'Claimed By Shadow' gave me the sense the author was trying too hard with her plot, as things become very tangled at the expense of characterization. This could have been wonderful if motivations were shown instead of told in dialogue.In short, this novel was fast and suspenseful without being great. A nice quick read if you go for vampires and magic. It felt much more like paranormal romance than fantasy."
5,second book -- better than the first,"""Claimed by Shadow"" centeres on a young lady with clairvoyant powers, who is half-way to becoming ""the"" magical time-travel cop -- against her will. Her enemies include vampires and mages who wish either to control her every move or see her dead. Rather than succuming, she chooses to risk it all, and confront her main enemy, the vampire who raised her. She picks up two mage ""alies"" with their own agenda along the way. Expect time travel, surprises, and complex personalities.This novel is a wonderful surprise, enjoyable throughout. Developments along the way are fun and entertaining in their own right -- this isn't the sort of book where you can read the last chapter and pretty much have read the whole book. I liked it much better than the first, and it can certainly be read in isolation. There is quite a bit of graphic adult topics (aka lust & sex) that will offend sensitive readers; and this cannot be avoided as it is sprinkled throughout the book."
2,downhill slide,"As others have noted, to me, the number 1 problem is that there is too much explanation going on. It bogs down the story and makes it oh so boring. It felt like pages and pages and pages went by that, in realtime, was a nanosecond of inner monologue as she explained, gave commentary, hedged back and forth, then came back to real time. None of which really was necessary for the story or character building or of general interest.Second major problem is that it bears just too much resemblance to the LKH Anita Blake series. Granted, you can tell she is giving it her own spin here and there, but the bare bones of the theme are just too close and invites unfavorable comparison (whether you liked the AB series or hated it.)Having nothing to read, I stuck it out but just had to quit by the third book, it was just progressively too awful."
3,Love the product but hate the shipping.,"For taste I would rate this: 5 StarsPrice: 0 StarsI absolutely love birch beers especially the white ones. The Kutztown is smooth, has not funny aftertaste and has that incredible wintergreen taste that is characteristic of the birch beers.I was so excited to see this product sold at amazon because birch beers are nearly impossible to find locally. The $1.50 price tag was nice as well but then I looked at shipping -- the cost of which brings it up to $8.00 per bottle (shipping is $6.50 for each).If you can find it locally I would highly suggest you try this awesome drink but at $8.00 a bottle here it is not worth the money."
2,"Yes, disjointed is correct.","This actually wasn't what I was expecting but the director was trying something different and I don't feel it worked for me. There was not a lot of FFN and I was disappointed with the quality of the female actresses. At most, they were good looking, not stunning.The reference to Nikki Fritz was what brought me to this, but after going thru the 3 DVD's, I didn't see her at all. I will go back and watch them again but trust me, Nikki Fritz isn't one that you'd miss in a scene. The DVD's would have been better if there where a couple more girl/girl scenes. Never been a fan of hardcore so I'm not looking for as much of the guys in these things."
2,I was not very pleased,"This was not what I expected, most of the scenes were not very professional, and the actors were for the most part ugly. Only a couple of skits were worth any time."
3,"kinda cool, but kinda awkward","It's great for doing what it says it does. But it's too much. I wish it was wireless or something. I might start using it again if I got phone calls all day. I felt a little to wired up, like I could tangle on stuff as I walked by. I found it way easier to set my phone on vibe, and just put my headphones around my neck when I get a call. It does what it's supposed to do though, and I'd recommend it if you did get calls all day, and can't part with your tunes even for a second."
3,DnD 1 and 2,"One is classic, and funny in the sense that its trying to simulate DnD. The second movie is much more true to DnD, but maybe a little too close thus losing the sense of a story and instead just having many DnD references (Possibly this view is due to my interest in DnD). I recommend these movies only to those who have, or are still playing Dnd; anyone else seeing this will just be witness to a B-grade fantasy movie."
4,"It's fairly good, but not great.","It's hard to rate this box set. I would give the first movie 4 stars, and the second one 3. The acting, special effects and overall plot are just kinda above average in both films. The first movie has a bit better acting and plot. The bad guy in the first movie is the main difference I think. He's pretty cool, but in the second film he returns and is a completely different person it seems. The films are more light hearted and fun than anything else. If you're looking for a serious Sci-fi movie D&D probably isn't for you. If you want a fun fantasy that has some laughs and a little bit of action then you will probably enjoy this movie set."
4,These aren't good movies,"No, these are terrible movies. If you play D&D; (as I do) you will watch these movies, and laugh. You will sit around with friends (perhaps drinking) and enjoy how bad the movies are. The second one is much better than the first. The bonus features are also worth checking out. The movies aren't good, but you will enjoy watching them. At least, I did.These movies are not tongue in cheek, as movies like Gamers 2: Dorkness Rising. These movies are played straight.There is a 3rd movie out now, and it's even better than these two. It's the Book of Vile Darkness."
2,Terrible and not so terrible,"The first movie is so terrible it's almost painful to watch. The second movie is actually kind of mediocre, but if you watch it immediately after the first one it will seem like a masterpiece in comparison.If you buy this DVD, make sure you get it for as close to $1.00 as possible. Anything more is just too much to pay for it."
3,dd,"ungeons and dragons are my favoret type of movies, these two are great, action is great acting not bad, i have seen worse. U will enjoy."
2,WHERE HAS THE REAL SOUNDTRACK GONE?,"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ""VERSION"" OF THE MUSIC SCORE.I HAVE FOUND THE ORIGINAL SOUND TRACK. ORIGINAL IS PAINFULLY AND WONDERFULLY EMOTIVE.THIS RECORDING FAILS TO CONVEY THE INTENSE ART OF THE ORIGINAL---REALLY FAILS.IF THIS MOVIE IS SACRED TO YOU, DON'T SPOIL IT BY BUYING THIS WATERED DOWN REPRINT."
4,Asked and Answered,The selection of artists is good though still throughout all three cd's the balcony song is missing( Massive Attack: Radiation ruling the nation).Still an album where you can pick anyone of the artists and buy the cd and be happy.
5,Like nothing else you've ever seen,"This DVD recreates an event unique in the history of American folk music: An artist of international renown ""camping out"" with 40 tenacious fans for a three-day weekend. What happened in Indiana that weekend was more than history, though. It was magic. The artist, her staff, the fans, and the Benedictine nuns came together looking like an unlikely ensemble at best. We parted three days later feeling like family. Janis Ian's music has always been about what ties us together as humans. She turned out to be as honest, as down-to earth, as gracious, and as beautiful as her music. This DVD does a wonderful job of sharing the artistry, the music, and an unforgettable magical weekend."
5,If you're not a fan you will be!,"OUTSTANDING! The chance to see a true master of her craft share her talents and personality with no smoke or mirrors or whistles or bells. Just her voice, her guitar and herSELF. She performs songs rarely if ever done in her regular concerts, provides a master class in peforming that even nonperformers found great value in hearing, and tells some behind the scenes stories about how some songs came to be. A must have for anyone even remotely acquainted with Janis Ian, or even remotely fond of exquisitely talented singers and guitarists."
5,One of Our Favorites,"The Longest Day: Music From The Classic War Films (Soundtrack Anthology) is a very good collection of themes from WWII movies. ""Where Eagles Dare"" is by far the best recording on this CD followed buy ""The Great Escape,"" ""633 Squadron,"" ""Force 10 From Navarone"" and ""The Bridge At Remagen."" We play this in the car very often."
4,Not the original!,"I love the themes...especially Bridge at Remagan...but was disappointed to discover that they we not from the original soundtrack recordings...it's sort of a ""The Pops Goes to War"". The themes hold up...but not like the originals..."
1,The Longest Day Music Disappoints,This will be short. I was searching for original movie soundtracks and was disappointed once this arrived that I was mistaken. This is not what I had hoped it would be.
4,Not the originals but not too bad a substitute,"I knew in '94 when I bought this CD that these were not the original recordings. Yet the themes of the vast majority of the films featured on this CD are from soundtracks that were or are out of print. As a huge war movie and movie soundtrack fan I was looking for a reasonable fascimile of some of my favorite film scores. This CD provided the next best thing to those unavailable soundtracks.In the last few years movie soundtracks have become big business with every year seeing the re-release of some of the old classics. The original soundtrack recordings for A Bridge Too Far, Midway, The Great Escape, and others have recently been released on CD. If you have been looking for that opening theme to a favorite war film then you might be able to at last get the original soundtrack on CD; but if that soundtrack is still out of print, ""The Longest Day: Music from Classic War films"" is not a bad alternative."
2,Great selection but poor quality of recording.,"The selection of music is great but the sound quality is very poor. I don't know anything about recording or even if this orchestra is doind a bad job in itself, but some of these pieces I have on other recordings and they're so much better. All of these recordings lack power, verve, oomph, or whatever you want to call that feeling you're supposed to get when you hear really great martial music. I keep raising the volume hoping that that will do the trick but it doesn't. It quite simply is a poor recording and I do not recommend this volume. Get the pieces on other recordings (soundtracks to Great Escape, A Bridge Too Far, Patton, etc. are all much better)."
4,"Great tunes, but...","This is a terrific complilation of some great war movie themes. One issue that I have with it is that the song listed as the ""Battle of Britain"" is actually ""Aces High"" from ""Luftwaffe March"", and not the main theme of the movie. I really like this piece, but it was not the one I was looking for when I bought the CD."
1,This CD/orchestra is serously distorted!,"This one is simple: The Orchestra of the City of Prague recorded these themes without the slightest clue as to their subject, original sound or emphasis. This is a truly bad effort."
4,A great ice-breaker,"An excellent introduction to slang and idiomisms, use it carefully and you'll have a superb time. I tried it in many bars in Jakarta and Bali to great effect."
2,Almost useless,"I guess, if a person just wants to know how to be vulgar in Indonesian, this may prove helpful. Many of the uses (gua in place of saya, for example) are not as commonly used as this pamphlet (can't call it a book, really) would suggest. My suggesion is, save your money for something more constructive."
1,review of making out in indonesian,"This book is standard publishing company fluff with a catchy title. It's a few words copied out of a dictionary. The same words are repeated several times per page (i.e. if they show the word used with 'I', then they also show it used with 'you', 'he', &c. even though the verb doesn't change in Indonesian). The text is spaced in such a way as to make the book appear bigger than it actually is. In essence the information contained in this book would fit on one page."
2,To be used only among friends!,"An amusing guide to some of the rudest slang in the language. Useful in a practical sense only if Indonesian speakers are among your closes friends, or if you're happily acquiring a potentially offensive or troublemaking vocabulary in Bahasa Indonesia. My Indonesian speaking friends were the ones who got the biggest laugh out of it, but unless you've already got a good grasp of the language and the culture, beware utilizing most of the vocabulary in this book..."
1,What a piece of CRAP!,"No apologies to anyone; this CD was a complete waste of time. I barely recalled the music when I saw the film (which should have warned me), but other reviewers here said it was a great score, exciting, thrilling and such.WHAT were THEY listening to???This CD is little more than sampled percussion, drum hits and a lot of synth string lines. Not a melody or theme anywhere to be heard. It's very much in the lines of low-budget TV thriller music that can't afford an orchestra and uses samples and synth.I'm glad I only lost $[...] in the deal.Track down and listen to the John Williams original if you can find it; it's worth the search and is much more rewarding. On the plus side, at just about 29 minutes each, both scores fit back to back on the same CD."
2,Meh,"Same review for all the course kit, each kit assumes you don't own any of the other kits and come with duplicate stuff. And there is nothing in these books that you can't learn for free on You Tube."
3,hard to unfasen the old one,"the part may be ok ,but i have not been able to un fasen the old one,i even put some heat on it. my brother said that sometimes the threads come off with the old part and i may need to replace they pipe as well ,before installing the new sensor."
5,Awesome,"Best baster I've ever used! Everything about it was above my standards! Easyto use, easy to clean! Highly recommended! The price was great also!"
5,Big Improvement,This is a much better baster than my old standby. I love the cleaning brush that is included. Would highly recommend it.
5,Zyliss Angled Baster,"So far, so good! I like the angle effect....no more turning upside down so that you drip liquids onto the oven."
3,"Works, but very slowly","This is great for changing the oil without any mess (goes straight into your used oil container) or hot oil on your hands. I used it on my 2.3 04 Mazda. The only complaint is that it drains very slowly. I expected this however since looking at it the valve hole is really small, which is only made smaller by the fact that the valve is opened by placing a wire into it further obstructing flow. If your oil is really thick or ""chunky"" it I suspect it may not flow at all (but you have bigger problems if you are waiting that long to do oil changes).The thing I wasn't expecting was when I removed the plug a bit more oil came out. It may not be enough for most people to care but it bothers me a little since I'm the kind of guy that waits for the dripping to stop.Anyway if you are the kind of guy or gal who isn't obsessed with removing every bit of old oil out, and doesn't mind taking a break while waiting for it to drain I highly recommend it."
1,did not fit,Even though the part finder said this would fit it didnt the drain hole plug for my 1997 nissan sentra GXE.
3,Good Introduction on Transformative Mediation,"A good introduction on Transformative Mediation but just a good ""Introduction"".It would have been nicer had the authors discussed more about the skills which can be used in Transformative Mediation.Nevertheless it is still a rather interesting read."
5,Exactly what it should be.,"'Bitter with Baggage' the first book by this author was a cute concept--step in the right direction, 'Coco' is the arrival of the right direction. An entirely cute story of the chicks I always loved to get in my Easter Basket. A friend of mine and I sat in a book store and read it, it is just far too cute."
4,Eye-Candy for All Ages,"This is an absolutely adorable book meant for young children. It's actually hard to attach an age range to the book because it's so cute that older kids and adults will get dragged into reading it too.What makes Where is Coco Going?"" so cute are the little yellow 'Easter' chicks. You know the kind that are fluffy with wires in them so you can make them pose. Well, Stefan Hagen, the artist for this book, has used dozens of these little cuties in his elaborate sets. And Coco does go... by plane, train, and other means.Absolutely adorable, it's eye-candy for every age; and toddlers and preschoolers will probably enjoy the idea of 'going to Grandma's'.Pam T~mom and reviewer at BooksForKids-reviewsNote: Just a head's up. This author has another book out with cute little chicks but it is NOT mean for young children. It's set in middle school and meant for middleschoolers."
2,Not so great,"I love Buffy books, but I did not enjoy this one... The characters were not true to the show. The writing was ok and so was the plot. I actually stopped reading about 3/4's of the way. The plot just wasn't working for me."
4,Basic Buffy Novel Delivers,"Okay, if I could use fractions, this would be a 3.7 stars review, and no one is pretending that Afterimage is a great literary masterpiece. On the other hand, this is a piece of tie-in fiction that was written (unlike some others) by someone who clearly has a feel for the characters, the mythic story arc, and the context of the show involved. When someone writes a tie-in novel where the characters are reasonably true to the show, the dialogue matches the rhythm and voice of the characters, the plot matches up to the type of plots the show has, and the read is generally quick and enjoyable, you just have to give the author a bit of extra credit. Beside, having given Queen of the Slayers a generous two-stars, how can I give this much better tie-in novel any less than four stars? Fun, enjoyable, and well-matched to the source material, Afterimage is a solid, entertaining tie-in which is true to its source. If you are reading these reviews, isn't that what you want to know?"
4,Perfect Latter Day 'Q,"This best captures the current sound and lineup of today's NRBQ, a band with a looooong history. Songs like ""Blame It On the World"" and ""Sail On, Sail On"" contain exquisite hooks and show why these guys are some of music's best songwriters, even without the great writer Al Anderson on guitar. There's the usual crazy humor. Who else could write songs about hotel housekeeping and termites and make them hummable, besides being great? One or two tunes go over the top: ""I Want My Mama."" But they're just Terry being Terry. This guy is a fab musician who could keep up with Thelonious Monk if he had wanted to. Fill out your Q collection with this overlooked little gem."
4,So what did we expect?,"Those of us who love nrbq have come to expect uneven albums. Their slickest work seems to have come when they relinquish some amount of control, after which they change record companies. Obviously they miss the writing of Big Al, but why did they insist on writing all of the songs themselves? Many of their best songs were written by others. Come on guys, do your homework! Still the greatest live band ever..."
4,A Work of Prophecy?,"In the Old Testament, prophets were people--usually men--who called the people to a new faithfulness and a new way of looking at their relationship to God.In years to come, John Shelby Spong may be considered a prophet, a man who, in the 20th and 21st centuries, led Christians to a new way of looking at our faith and our relationship with God, to a new, deeper and more meaningful relationship based on love and affirmation of life rather than condemnation of life and what it means to be human.Prophets were not popular in the Old Testament and efforts were often made to shout them down. And so it has been with John Shelby Spong--but the man is worth reading and considering. The man will make you think and he may lead you, like the prophets of old, to a new, deeper and more meaningful faith."
5,A brave man,"Spong will be vilified by those who make an idol of the Bible. He has used the brain God gave him to understand what human beings thought about God over the period of time it was written, and to compare that with what has been revealed to us since. The belief that what people believed two and three thousand years ago is true and helping to bring about God's kingdom now, is endangering this beatiful world which God gave humankind for a temporary home. It is endangering all of God's people."
1,Opus Maleficus,"Disturbingly deceptive agnostic encyclical -- should be called ""Opus Maleficus"" (Work of Malicious Deception). I can't believe Bill O'Reilly gave an endorsement.In a postmodern era, where truth is relative and reality undefinable, this book provides quick and easy pain relief, kind of like putting ambesol on a rotten tooth. Spong's premise is straightforward, remove Christianity's belief that we are sinful, and the tough messages of Christ go away. Any religion, including a Savior-less Christianity that does not deal with our problem of sin will probably do quite a bit to make us feel better about ourselves - hey and thats what liberal thought is all about.Do not fall for Spong's appealing postmodern message. Realize that reality exists; if the God of the Bible is real, you must repent from your sins and place your only hope in Christ."
1,Faithless message from an irrelevant bishop of a Dying Sect,"Faithless social justice message from an irrelevant relic ""bishop"" of a withering Christian sect (formerly the Episcopal denomination)"
1,Pure garbage,"This book, like all of Spong's writing, is based on an oversimplied understanding of outdated scholarship. As such, it has no merit and is not worth the money or the time spent on reading it.I have no problem with exploring the works of liberal thinkers. I've spent time with Schleiermacher, Tillich, and Bultmann and read the critiques of classical Christianity offered by Nietzsche, Freud, Marx, Feuerbach, and others. Those are good examples of criticisms of the Bible and orthodox Christianity; Spong is not. He may be popular, but the crowd with which he is popular is simply the mirror image of the Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson fanbase. The ""open-minded"" Spong not only misrepresents the orthdoxy he attacks, but he is also just about the poorest representation of his own liberal tradition."
1,revisionist history = zero credibility.,"Okay, let's get it straight: Jesus was not married, no matter how much you read The da Vinci Code. At least, the evidence was overwhelming. It's certainly possible, but in His case it's not probable. Like most Jewish holy men of his time, he was celibate. The wedding at Cana was not His, since He stated it's ""no business"" of His that they ran out of the drinky-drinky. Paul used examples of Jesus' disciple's marriages when defending marriage. If Jesus was married, he would've most likely used, you know, the Son of God's marriage as a good example? But he doesn't. Because He wasn't. Married.There is nothing in the discredited gnostic gospels that say he was married, either. Where does Spong get this idea?Spong just has a chip on his shoulder with conservatives, theologically and politically. Nothing new to see here."
1,"No Higher Power, so make-up your own morality","Well, since the concept of a higher power who in creation established eternal truths is a primative, pre-Newtonian construct, then any religion which establishes moral codes and acknowledges such is false. Therefore - the world must adopt the peace, love, free-sex and non-judgemental view of the 1960's. There are only 5 Commandments:1 - Thou shallt vote for Democrats2 - Thou shallt not condemn anyone except Christians3 - Thou shallt not hold to any moral absolutes4 - Thou shallt not believe in God as anything other than the""feel-good"" desires held within oneself5 - Thou shallt believe all evil is the result of the BibleSpong is SOOOOO Al Franken, and so over. Can't wait til his next book."
2,"Bogus assumptions, but well written.","Spong does a delightful job at vocalizing his heretical views. The book is an easy and fun read, but I would recommend a counter-balance with some slight more orthodox material...Tillich, Barth, and or even Romero to name a few."
1,It's Simple,"This guy should be excommunicated! I suppose many Christians read the bible with their pre-conceived notions coloring their reading glasses, but this is blasphemy."
1,pssst - Its called Unitiarian-Universalism,"Pssst - All you Spong-ite fundamentalist-o-phobes ... there's a wonderful organization called ""Unitarian-Universalists"" .. you can believe anything you want, do anything you want, and still hangout at nifty elitist-looking church buildings.Like all of Spong's diatribes - this book is just rehashed 19th century Schleiermacher, with a bit of Michael Moore thrown in to make it hip. Just do a Google on Spong and read a few pages .. you'll get the jist and save yourself some money -- and a few trees too (that should please Spong)"
1,Controversy is popular. Congrats. You sold more books.,"However, writing about a popular idea does not make it truth. Argument by assertion is neither intelligent nor responsible. Spong's arguments are neither reasoned nor convincing, but only assumptive. The Bible is not a hopelessly mysterious collection of riddles. It is a simple read in plain ordinary language. There is only truth in God's word. Molesting the fabric of this truth may sell books, but it does not change truth to lies as Spong would have people believe."
5,Excellent for the general reader.,"The Sins of Scripture is clear, non-technical, and presents material in a manner easily understood by the general reader such as myself.The Sins of Scripture, like other books by Dr. Spong, shows that you can be a Christian without leaving your brains at the Church door as you enter."
4,A Thinking Person's Preacher...,"Quite simply, this is Christianity for people who prefer to use reason and intellect rather than swallow the pablum doled out by fundamentalist preachers more interested in power than in prayer. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it's not quite as good a read as ""Rescuing the Bible"" and ""Liberating the Gospels"", both of which rate fives."
4,Spong exposes biblical texts of hate,"Former Episcopal Bishop Spong exposes some biblical texts that are counter to the God of love. Particularly interesting was his description of tribal attitudes towards creation, women, children, and sexual orientation that have become ""holy"" because they are in the Bible."
4,The Sins of Scripture,A faithfulled and comtemporary exploration of the Bible and how it has been used to meet the needs of man rather than to the glory of God.
4,The Sins of Scripture,"The book have really helped me to see how the Scripture has been used incorrectly by many. I have for some time blamed the readers too much and not what's in the Scripture themselves. I still feel that many use the Scripture to make or confirm their bias etc, but many are using bad Scripture correctly for the same reasons."
3,Equal Opportunity Offender,"Years of university level teaching and writing have led to a manuscript that's sometimes tedious to read. That said, Spong's hit on a number of issues that have been bugging me for decades. I'd recommend this book to anyone who's uncomfortable with the way his/her church deals with the topics of the day - i.e. homosexuality, Jew vs Christian, child rearing. In the end, he challenges nearly every faith and, for those with open minds, gives us new perspectives for our future faith lives."
5,LIFE CHANGING PURE AND SIMPLE SPONG IS THE GREATEST CHRISTIAN OF ALL TIME,LIFE CHANGING BOOK ONE OF THE MOST INFORMATIVE BOOKS EVER WRITTEN PERIOD!! SPONG IS INCREDIBLE I HOPE HE LIVES TO 150 AND KEEPS TEACHING US THE TRUTH
3,Who's sins?,"I am disappointed with this book. Our Sunday school class was studying it. I gave up after a while, it was too negative. I understand the positives come at the end of the book, but I can't wade through that much negative to get there. It would have been better, it seems to me to explain throughout the chapters that these concepts, which have caused so much suffering and hatred, have come from the cultural backgrounds of the various writers of the Bible, not from God. I don't know whether I'll finish reading the book."
4,A must read for all Evangelical Christians,"In this book Spong again attempts to characterize his view of Christianity by attacking one of its sacred cows, the Holy Scripture. As an Evangelical Christian, I found this book a wonderfully interesting read. I disagree with Spong on almost everything, but I appreciate his attempt to make us think differently. The bottom line is he is just simply wrong. He uses faulty logic and anecdotal evidence which doesn't do anything other than convince me that he is being somewhat intellectually dishonest with us. But, if you are a thinking Christian please read this book so that you will be well prepared to discuss with others. If you are a non-Christian, be aware that Spong's views are definitely in the minority in Christendom and should be taken with a grain of salt. That's My View..."
1,Same ol Same ol (You'll love it if you're an atheist),"How many times and how many books must the Episcopal Church's resident athiest write to get out his point ... More of the same - ""Christ was a social activist, Christianity must ""let go"" of faith and the divine, divinity is primative superstition, liberalism is wonderful, homosexuality and free sex are OK"" .. Feel good social activism diguised as scholarship. Absolutely nothing new or ""refreshing"" here ... same Spong - same message."
3,Basic balisong techniques but extensive knife fighting skills,"This is a good book on the basics of Filipino knife fighting which covers very basic information. The illustrations are adequate but at times confusing. The 4 basic attacks of the slash, rake, gouge and rip are discussed, and although I already knew the principles, there was still a hearty discussion. There are a few important key points such as the ""Visayan Knife Cutting Do's and Don'ts"" and the ""17 Slashes of Death"". These 17 ""Slashes"" are the main vascular pathways that, if attacked, will lead to incapacitation. Defensive and Offensive drills are illustrated but author/photographer do not make it clear on who the actual person is that we are supposed to emulate (both wear black shirts).It's a decent book but there are far better titles than this one. It's worth a read but more detail is covered in other texts, such as The Balisong Manual and Advanced Balisong Manual by Jeff Imada."
2,Average brief overview to knife fighting,"I don't claim to be a master knife fighter, but I have found most of the information in this book elsewhere on the Internet and available for free. There were some parts that I found new and interesting. For example the chapters on rolling and closed knife techniques.But, everything thing in this book is still just an overview. The chapters are very short and don't go into much depth. They just give you a few pictures to work with. I was hoping to see detailed step by step manuevers for foot work and perhaps a detailed map of the body labelling pressure points.The book was not what I expected. Try google before you commit to buying a book."
4,The Black Dog - Genetically Modified,"The Black Dog (now just one man plus spoken word vocalist Black Sifichi) gets the remix treatment on GENETICALLY MODIFIED. While Jimmy Cauty's version of ""Invisible Things"" still hems to The Black Dog's penchant for all things Egyptian, Technova takes ""Interview"" into deep electo-funk. A1 People take ""Dogbite"" into Middle Eastern noir, while C-PIJ goes all free-jazz on it. The Black Dog's own mixes of ""Unsavoury Products"" and ""Voodoo"" features the angular melodies that we've come to love. And after a long absence, CJ Bolland takes the joke of ""Mental Health Hotline"" and sets it to a driving beat, somehow making it funnier. Same goes for the Beloved's take of ""Wishing Well."" On a different note, Mescalito goes jazzy downtempo, while Laub adds their own vocals, aiming for some abstract ambience. But the bonus material at the end -- the fake advertisements -- are a testament to a man, while influential, refuses to take himself too seriously."
1,does not fit correctly,"Was designed for something else as It does not fit my 8"" DeWalt bench grinder.Junk."
5,Great stuff!,"My husband had requested these as a weight loss aid, and they work :-) Plus, they taste good. I may have to get ME some!"
2,pine nuts,it is too expensive for the nasty taste . i don't know what else to say about it. wish i could return the rest.
2,"Not ""Pre-Fit""","A recoil pad is not ""pre-fit"" if you have to drill holes into the stock in order to install it. ""Pre-fit"" means you should unscrew the old pad, and screw this one in. The overall size matched my Ruger but the holes were nowhere near close."
1,a waste of money,"This is a horrible CD and could make a hater of Andrew Lloyd Webber's beautiful songs. Poor voices, bad orchestration.Buy the Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection: Sarah Brightman CD instead."
5,Adam rocked my world,"This is a gem of an album; intelligent lyrics sung with feeling and laid on a bed of great guitar, keyboard and drums. It doesn't sit in any genre comfortably; if it's country it's also rock. I've got these songs on various playlists on my iPod - with REM, with Fleetwood Mac, with Dylan, with Josh Ritter: it fits in superbly. The Ritter combination is particularly successful; both singers inject their music with humor and sing like they're smiling.Needless to say, I recommend this album. If you're in doubt try listening to couple of the tunes on the sample links, then hit Buy!"
5,Worth waiting for....,"I have been wanting this CD for nearly a year because it had only been released in Canada. Well, I finally got it and just as I had suspected, I love it! Melanie Doane has a great voice and is an incredible violin player. ""There is no Beautiful"" is the best song on the CD. This one is definitely worth your money."
5,"You may not know her from Adam, but Melanie Rocks!","This is one of those CDs that you can listen to the whole way through without skipping any tracks. When it's finished, you want to go back for more. From the sarcastic ""Happy Homemaker"" to the inspirational ""Goliath"", you just can't get enough of Melanie's smooth lyrics and awsome violin playing. I've been listening to Melanie for a while now, having been introduced to her music while listening to Canadian radio stations.... Hopefully, more radio stations and other outlets in the US will check this out and see what the rest of us who love Melanie's music already know. <P... Her newest CD, ""Melvin Live"" is a must have for anyone who wants a glimpse into Melanie's live show."
3,left me haning...,"I love the 2 other books from Suzy Spencer that I have read, but this one left me wondering why, and how?I wish there was more explanation about the two killers, I felt like I learned more about Lisa, Chris' girlfriend then I did the killers."
2,An average true crime book.,Nothing impressive about the writing of this story. It's your typical average true crime book. No real insights as to why it happened and what pushed the killers to do what they did. I wished the author would have placed more emphasis on the victim and given us additional information on him and his family.
5,An Encyclopedia of Yoga Postures,"An encyclopedia for yoga students and yoga teachers alike. Covers postures, breathing techniques, cleansing exercises and much more. A book to be read and re-read over and over again.Gudjon Bergmann, author ofLiving in the Spirit of Yoga: Take Yoga Off the Mat and Into Your Everyday Life(2010) andThe Seven Human Needs: A practical guide to finding harmony and balance in everyday life(2006)"
5,in depth,"Wow! Anyone who does yoga should be reading and reading this book. If you are interested in yoga, are thinking of starting yoga, are currently doing yoga, or are currently teaching yoga...THIS IS THE BOOK that should be in your hands or on your shelf. Asana's or broken up into Beginners, Intermediate, or Advanced chapters. Along with a list of the benefits of each position. It has great instruction of absolutely everything. It even has yoga practices for your eyes! Completely, completely surpasses every other book on yoga, head and shoulders! Of course that is to be expected, because this book is written by an actual indian yogi, Swami Satyananda Saraswati. GET THIS, GET THIS, GET THIS!"
1,WORST SPEAKERS EVER,"I don't know if these speakers came defective, but the subwoofer air exhaust lining vibrates. And this produces an awful sound, unless you virtually shut down the subwoofer it won't rattle. I'm returning them tomorrow, they are a pice of junk."
3,"OK, But Not Quite Great","I've been using these T3030's for about 3 years now. They have worked well and I haven't had any problems with them. The wired volume and bass control is very nice. What I find slightly disappointing is the sound quality. To me, they just don't sound very good. Not terrible, but not really that good either. I think they sound better for watching movies or video than for music. Then again, for the price they are better than a lot of the others in this price range, so I gave them 3 stars instead of 2 for the low price."
1,Be warned,"I was happy with these speakers until the on off volume control core was damaged and there is no way to fix it or get another, so I have to throw these expensive speakers in the trash because only the cord needs repaired. I have emailed the company and they say they can't provide replacement cords. Basically they didn't give a crap. Don't buy these or any other Creative Lab Speaker!DJ Bland"
4,They're just great,"I read a lot of reviews on a lot of 2.1, 3.1 and 4.1 systems before going with this T3030 for many reasons, but one being extremely important: I live in Caracas, Venezuela. So there's no turning back, no warranty. I bought these on Dec-13 and got them today (Jan-24) so you get the picture. I'm extremely happy (as a pig in s#1t) with this set of speakers. The sound is just awesome for such a cheap system. I listen to almost everything from brutal death metal to jazz and prog rock, and they haven't let me down yet. I even played a little with my media player's equalizer and tested the system response to each one of the 10 EQ bands I could tweak. I have to say what Travolta said when opening ""The Briefcase"" in Pulp Fiction: ""We happy"".I took a star off because I'm incredibly lazy and the remote could be wireless ... Volume control right on my bed, YEAH! ... Maybe I'll give that star back someday.I'll be writing again in a month or so to report how the T3030 are behaving."
2,Subpar System,"This is the third system I have bought made by Creative and this is the first time I am dissapointed in their product. In short, it is OK at low levels but should you try to turn it up even just a little, the sound goes out of sync. It becomes painfully boomy and uncontrollable. I had to almost turn off the base using an equalizer. I wouldn't recommend this particular product."
4,Good For The Price!!!,"These speakers for the price, are an exceptional value. Although at high volume they do distort quite a lot. But coming from the computer at low-level of under 75% they sound just fine and the base is awesome !!! Other than the distortion at high volume levelsCreative Inspire T3030 2.1 Speaker System ( 51MF0315AA002 ), I can say nothing bad about these speakers. If you are thinking about computer speakers,but don't want to spend a lot of money, this is definitely the way to go. You won't be sorry!!!"
4,Perfect!,"I am so happy with this product that its unexplainable. It strikes a perfect balance between personal listening needs and disturbance to outsiders. This means that while you listen to your music the way you want (with tolerable bass and vol., not only you will get the complete feel of you music, but also it won't disturb people outside of you room, if your door is closed.Ideal for personal listening but not that fit for a party. Could be good for a small get together of your friends in you room.otherwise, great product."
5,Replacement Speakers,"Creative Inspire T3030 2.1 Speaker System ( 51MF0315AA002 )The overall product quality is excellent. The included remote makes volume and bass level adjustment very handy, important when you have multiple users with differing preferences.The length of the speaker wires allow for easy placement with good separation. This is a great value for a reasonable price."
5,Lost Tribes of Israel,"By far one of the most intriguing episodes of Nova! I've been a fan of the show for decades and this is one of the best episodes of the series. It follows the claim that many Ethiopians are directly descended from the lost tribes of Isreal. The most fascinating part of the show was when the researchers started conducting DNA tests searching for the ""Cohen"" gene. Basically, the word Cohen loosely translates into ""man of God"". They conducted this test on American Jews and Ethiopian Jews and found the ""Cohen"" gene more often in Ethiopian Jews than in other Jewish populations."
4,Good book,"This is a pretty decent book, as it explains the fundamentals from the start, and then gives very thorough derivations in all chapters. My only beef with this book is that it isn't long enough, and that it focuses mostly on SCR aplications (There is alot on phase controlled rectification). It is also a good reference for studying and designing SCR commutation circuits."
1,There are better references for McCoy,"Generally inferior to the real collector books on McCoy--the Nissen Hanson volumes, Sanford volumes, Huxford and the original Coates books. Pictures not as detailed, poor organization, incomplete reference for this prolific pottery."
1,The thumbs down reviews are correct,My pets are far funnier than this pathetic jackass (& much cuter too). So people in Amerika actually PAY to be verbally puked on by mediocre egomaniacs?
3,Sort of funny,"We're big stand up fans. We hadn't seen Louis CK butheard other comedians call him a ""comedian's comedian"" sowe thought we'd rent the video.Some parts were funny but I found his act a littledisorganized. We'll try another of his videos atsome point but he may not be our cup of tea."
5,Simply Amazing,"I am a father of three quickly approaching 40. Louis CK completely captures the experience of the life of a middle aged white man headed towards the twilight years. I had to watch this with headphones, it's certainly not for the kids, but my laughter was out loud and genuine. If you have a Prime membership and adult comedy doesn't offend you, you simply owe it to yourself to spend an hour watching this."
5,Louis C.K. Is The New King Of Comedy!,"in a word....""Hysterical""!Louis C. K. is the middle aged man's comedian! He is the greatest living comic alive today. Wrap it up in a bow and buy one for your ex-wife!"
4,C.K is Hilarious,"Louis is such a great stand-up comedian who has excelled since the early days of his career. I have a young daughter myself, and I am experiencing the same situations in my life. In addition to the use of word ""faggot"", the health problems, ...etc.He keeps me in-check and locked in.A great item to own & watch with friends!"
5,Laughed out Loud,I'm not one for long reviews but this deserves a 5 star rating: I Laughed out loud. Laughed out loud. Laughed out loud. Brilliant. I was alone and the only soul in my house and he had me howling!
2,Mediocre,"Mildly entertaining, but I ended up skipping big chunks ahead looking for sections that were better, but they never came. A bit of a waste of time."
1,Oh my what a joke,"Very offensive at the start. Thought I would watch more, but couldn't take the verbal abuse. Whatever happened to the Lenny Brucess of the comedy world?"
1,Crass and Vulgar,"I could not get past the first 10 minutes. I did not find it funny at all. Repetition of swear words and obscenities again and again - i failed to see any humor in it. Crass, cheap and vulgar - I wonder how anybody could stand this!"
1,Couldn't Make it through the first few minutes,"To paraphrase the opening monologue: ""f-gg-t f-gg-t f-gg-t .. f-gg-t f-gg-t .. f-gg-t f-gg-t.""I am as open-mindedly irreverent as the next guy, but I can't get past the first repeated abuse of a hateful slur at the beginning of the video, and I'm glad I didn't have friends or family watching with me."
1,really really crude....,I'm sorry... If I wanted to hear that many gay jokes and people referring to a woman's **** I sure as heck would be watching a comedy special. This was so distasteful that I couldn't even make it through the first 10 mins. Thumbs down.
4,"funny, clever humor","Louis CK has some great, entertaining insights into life in suburban America. His humor is accessible and at the same time clever."
3,"Get ""Shameless"" Instead","Let me start by saying Louis CK is by far my favorite comedian. I had high hopes for this show, but was let down. It covers all the familiar subject matter, taken from Louis' own life - his children's stupidity, his eating habits, masturbation, etc., but it feels like treaded ground instead of anything truly inspired here. There is some rare material here, such as his doctor visit (which the diagnosis is hilarious), but in the end everything seems like a less-funny rehash of his earlier work. It's still funny, hence the 3 stars, but if you're looking for something truly brilliant check out his earlier work Shameless."
2,disappointing,"Had heard good things about Louis CK. But what a disappointment. I forget which aspect of his crudeness turned me off. Was it animal cruelty? Hard to remember, but I know I don't want any more Louis CK."
4,"OK, but not his best...","Probably his best special since Shameless, which is my all time favorite of his.The passing of George Carlin left a huge void in the world. and the closest we will ever probably have to another Carlin is Louis C.k.While Carlin would have a focus on the life of politics, Louis has a focus on the politics of life.One of the most amazing.."
4,"""Chewed Up""- A Notch Below ""Shameless""","""Chewed Up"" is Louis C.K.'s follow up to ""Shameless"", which I feel is the better of the two performances. ""Chewed Up"" is funny, but less inspired than ""Shameless"". There are some funny bits in this second helping of ""in your face"" observational comedy which make ""Chewed Up"" worth a look. If you are a serious fan, then you should add it to your collection of Louis C.K. comedy. I love anything this funny man puts out and look forward to future releases."
4,I love this guy...,"...hey, I guess if you're a fan, how can you go wrong with this CD? This guy is funny, period."
3,"Doctor Who: Best of Vol. 2, Reviewed...","-- I appreciate this disc as it contains a couple variations of the main Doctor Who Theme... That said, it is not for everyone, But for serious enthusiusts of Soundtracks or Doctor Who fans ONLY.If you are a fan of only the New Series (2005 and onward), You might pass on this one, unless you are like me, obsessed with the DW Theme music."
1,What you see isn't what you get,The picture shows a 3 pc. bow roller. What you get is the center portion of that roller.
5,Beyond Klezmer,"I love the klezmer style of syncopation in minor keys -- it seems to say, ""Life is tough all over, but what the hell, let's dance."" Tsirkus takes the art form to a whole new level. I not only hear and feel the music -- I also see it. I wish I were a choreographer so I could design a dance for the title piece: full of tension and longing, yet brazenly confident -- the dark, beckoning side of the circus life. The clarinet and saxophone solos are fantastic, and David Wall's voice is exquisite."
3,Fun Bit Of Nostalgia,"It's a documentary on the lates 80's glam scene in L.A. Interviews include a freshly signed Poison and Faster Pussycat and a pre-signed Tuff & Vixen. There's also segments with industry vets, Kiss & Aerosmith. My personal favorite moment is Faster Pussycat's performance piece and the segment with Rikki Rachtman and the Cathouse. It's also cool to see a thriving Sunset Strip in it's prime. Unlike the other reviewers, I do enjoy glam and am happy to see somewhat of a resurgence with bands like Robin Black and the Intergalactic Rock Stars and Sugarcult. The Metal Years takes us back to a time when image, as well as music was larger than life."
4,Why isn't this on DVD?,"Every single other movie, even the most crappy has gotten a DVD release, why not this movie that showed a slice of American rock n' roll history? Its a damn crime this isn't on DVD, whose brilliant idea was it not to release this with all the trimmings? Probably the company who released it originally because most companies have the IQs of a rock when it comes to making a profit. This music is coming back with Van Halen and Poison selling out stadiums, this movie is due for a come back on DVD and get the release it deserves. Really pisses me off you have to get raped for a damn VHS, put the damn thing on DVD finally!"
2,Collection For The LP Age But No Longer Viable,"Better to get The Ultimate Collection or Anthology. As a CD, this one is stingy and an unworthy overview of this band's career."
4,Worthy Starting Point,"This collection is a great starting point for anyone interested in this group. The sound quality might not stand up to some of the more recent remastered discs and even modest fans will prefer the more extensive Ultimate Collection. Still, this disc contains most of the classics, including Easy, Brick House and Machine Gun, and it's all the Commodores many folks will ever need."
4,A Good Collection if you are starting out on the Commodores,this is a Good Warm-Up Collection if you are just starting too get into the Commodores.but there are more fuller Sets such as the Anthology&Broader sets.but this Contains some of the Best Jams&Showcases there Jams.
1,Wrong belt for 2005 Prius,This was the wrong belt for 2005 prius. Use 2004 or 2006 to get the right belt. I would also suggest to check bando website before you order it
5,"Arrived promptly, works as expected.",Quality seems good and it works as required.I am hopeful it will last well - it looks like a good product.
3,"Pendant is fine, the chain is terrible.","I like the pendant piece, but the accompanying chain is so short you'd have to have a 5"" neck to wear it! When I bought this piece, the description didn't really mention the chain, so I was suspicious. When I rceived it, I saw that my suspicions were correct. The chain was so small that I seriously doubt that and adult could wear it as a ""choker"". It was a choker alright! Regarding the pendant piece, it is very pretty. Not too big and not too small! The stones are small, but delicate. All in all, I am somewhat pleased with this purchase. I have ordered a longer chain to put the pendant on. I wonder if that might have been deliberate by the seller. Hmmm."
4,Yemeni Trio: From Mountains to Coast,"Originally issued by Lyrichord Records in 1975 and now available on Rounder, this album of Yemeni songs performed by the Kawabani brothers features oud and riqq tambourine and sometimes qanan zither and bongo-like double drums. Call-and-response with oud is featured with the steady treble of the drums and clangling cymbals of the riqq. In contrast to some other Yemeni albums that feature dances of heavy drumming, this recording is only vocal. The simple melodies and rhythms are straightforward and largely consistent throughout the album. One track is a quat-chewing song and was recorded in a room dedicated to the herb; indeed, the singer in this instance has a wad of the leaf within a cheek. Although the selections come from various regions of Yemen, any distinctions are not obvious. To my ears, the music here is more Arabian than what one expect from an ancient trade crossroads."
4,A Pot-o-Gold,"I sell wood carvings and the store owner asked for St Pat day carvings. The photos and items in the book triggered some ideas of my own...therefore yes, it was very helpful to me."
5,Thrilling Good Book!!!,"What a pleasant surprise! This book is a light, delightful romance involving two people who's lives weren't weighted down by terrible childhoods, extreme poverty, etc. They were normal people dealing in normal ways to life's events. I loved the banter between the Merry Widows. Their openness in discussing their needs and desires was refreshing!Marianne's confession about her marriage not being all it seemed was touching. Adam's various ploys to keep Marianne's ""suitors"" at bay were quite funny.There was a lot of sexual tension betwwen Adam and Marianne. The scene in the dark of night was great!! I was thrilled at the end when Marianne came to Adam in the same way he came to her. I really felt their love for each other at the end of the book. This was a very satisfing read!P.S. Another book with a similar theme is Julia Quinn's ""When He Was Wicked"" - another 5 star book!!!"
4,I really liked this one!,"This is a story about moving forward, finding new love and starting anew. I absolutely loved both Adam and Marianne. They were so great together! It was so excruciating watching them wanting to be together and seeing their obvious love for each other, while the circumstances kept them apart. OMG. I loved reading about them and I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in this series!"
2,Good Idea... Bad Writing...,"This book had a good premise, but a flawed execution.I was expecting a fresh new take on Regency romance, but this had to be one of the most mundane and predictable plots ever. The main characters don't have any spark. The author tells us they do - over and over - bet we never actually see it. The writing was laughable. (Yes, I know romance novels can get cheesy, but this was just awful. Every kiss ""shook to the core of the soul."")The punishment at the end was annoying. It was totally out of character for Marianne, she was acting like a moron.The Widow's Club gossip wasn't very racy and/or entertaining.I think if the author had instead made Clarissa and Sherwood's story the primary one, it would have been a much better read. They were the only ones that seemed to have chemistry."
2,Ho Hum,"Totaly boring and predictable. Half way through the book I decided to throw it out, but decided to stick with it. I wish I hadn't."
2,In the Thrill of the Night,"Five fairly young widows form a secret society with the purpose of finding lovers, not husbands. One of the women, Marianne Nesbitt, finds herself longing for the thrills, but having no idea how to get them. Therefore, she turns to her old friend, Adam Cazenove, for advice. He'd be glad to take on the job of her lover, but he's engaged to a girl who is thoroughly perfect for the station of his wife, but whom he does not love as he does Marianne. And so, two old friends proceed upon their chosen courses, while longing for something more with each other. The truth is, Marianne still loves David, her first husband, and does not want more than a shallow relationship, to avoid betraying the memory. That is something she can not have with Adam.** Though there is a very real, intriguing issue at the heart of the book, the plot is thin, focusing on extemporania, not the solid ground. **Amanda Killgore"
5,ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is my first book by this author, but I will definitely be looking for her earlier works and patiently waiting for the next one in this series. I will not go into any great details about the story as other reviews have already done this, but I totally enjoyed this story from page one. Just a plain love story without confusing plots and beating around the bush. I was captivated by Marianne and Adam and the depth of each. The story even had me laughing out loud at times. This is a keeper to be read again."
1,Boring Story,The Merry Widows are superficial and boring. I found the story to be boring and too easy to predict.
5,Vrooman family history,I am a direct descendent of Hendrick Vrooman who came to New York from Holland in 1664. This book (CD) is full of information and is a good starting point for a geneologist.
5,A winner!,"We enjoyed this DVD because the couples seem genuine and romantic but there's no holding back on the sex. The scenes are very explicit, but it is handled in a loving, affectionate way, not the typical porn approach. It's both instructive and sexy, and the couples are believable and attractive. The host, Dr. Patti Britton, is informative and likeable. Well worth multiple viewings!"
4,nice DVD for couples,"much better than I thought it would be. my wife tends to like the more subtle approach to sex (like many women) and I thought this DVD would be a nice change from the hardcore stuff I like. I was surprised to see I too liked it. we have already bought another DVD from the same company, but have not viewed it yet. the items are really useful and reinforce things as ""normal"" that my wife had thought were too taboo. the only thing I wished it had more of: more graphic sex (but that might be getting away from the whole concept of the DVD in the first place)."
1,dislike,boring. could of been alot better. maybe this would be good for couples who are just having sex for the first time.
4,Very Cute and Catchy!,"I just received this book for my 2 year old girl, and she loves it. She actually wants to sleep with this book! She loves to repeat the pharse--No, No Jo! and of course I love to hear her say it. Being that she's a late talker, any book that can catch her attention like this is great for us! I really enjoy reading this to her, and she loves this mischevious cat! A great read for a 2 year old!"
3,"Your Child May Like It, But You May Not","Toddlers are going to learn the power of the word ""No"" with or without this book, so that should be of no concern to any parent. And the fact that young children love saying ""No"" makes this story's refrain of ""No, no, Jo!"" that much more appealing. The rest of the text, though, is insipid. The rhyme scheme is forced and not all that clever. And the artwork is downright ugly compared to some of the fun and attractive illustration work in children's books. In the end, though, all your child may care about is that he enjoys the book, which he probably will."
3,"A sure-fire way to have your child saying ""no no!""","I bought this book primarily because it belonged to the Harper Growing Tree Series. Our daughter enjoys the book and actually seeks it out to be read to her. However, after having the book for only three days, we've decided to take it out of circulation. The refrain ""No No, Jo"", which appears on every page, is so rythmic and constant that it has our 18 month old responding to everything with ""No No."" Although the book successfully demonstrates through it's main charater, a kitten named Jo, that small children are usually well intentioned when they get into trouble, it's effect has been a tiresome refrain resounding around our house -- ""No no, no no"""
1,Book portrays negative attitude towards animals,"I felt so sorry for the cat in this book. Jo, a young kitten, wants to play with the two children in her house. Her attempts to interact with the children are unsuccessful, and the children make it clear that the cat is a nuisance to them. Jo is continually rebuffed with the words ""no no Jo"". This is supposed to be funny, but I found it a sad comment on the attitude our culture has towards animals - there are so many pets who are ill-treated, including the kitten Jo portrayed in this book. I am trying to teach my toddler to have a gentle and positive attitude towards our pets and other animals. For this reason, I did not want to have this book in our house. I would never recommend this book to anyone."
4,A nice trip through Doctor Who soundtracks,"In addition to the memorable Ron Grainer theme, this CD offers some nice selections from the Davison era, the excellent Sea Devils, weird 'Worlds of Doctor Who' and rarely heard Terror Version theme. Highly recommended. If you buy one Doctor Who soundtrack, this should be it."
3,A fun read,"This book is at times a hoot! A little confusing to begin with as I thought it was strictly a gardening book, however, anyone with a sense of humor (the darker the better) will get a kick out of the author's fictitious persona and hopefully, fictitious gardening columns. There are actually some pretty good horticultural gems, as well."
3,Tea is Tea is Tea,"This is basically a little more expensive than Lipton's and not the great tea some reviewers heartily asserted. I purchased Celestial Seasonings Black Tea, Devonshire English Breakfast, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) because of a very enticing offer at the time from Amazon and after reading the reviews. Packaging is all that and a bubblegum, I grant that. The philosophy of the written text on the side of the box, highly polished! The design and colors, that's what the ""hoopla"" is all about, I believe. Not a bad cup of tea but there are better values. 3 Stars for the 20 bags in each box Celestial Seasonings Black Tea."
5,lovely,I am very happy with this product and the speed with which I received it. I am very satisfied with the job the this vendor did. Thank y'all a whole bunch!
5,Great Purchase,The Xyron 145612 refill cartridge is exactly what I needed for my personal laminator. It is a great price for 60 foot of laminating material. As a teacher I use a lot and I use it often.
1,wrinkled,"With many attempts to straighten the laminating paper, it still was not smooth. Laminating does not look good when it is not smooth."
5,Worked so well!,"I bought the laminator at a yard sale for $1. It sat in the garage for a long time and then we needed it for a fun project at work. I got it out, googled the refills and ordered them from Amazon. I brought the laminator and the refill to work and one afternoon when we had an hour to spare, we decided to try and make it work thinking it would take that long to get the old cartridge out, put in the new one, and make it work correctly. WE WERE WRONG!!! The old slipped out, the new slipped in and we were laminating (without air bubbles) in less than 5 minutes!! This is one of the best buys I've gotten this year!"
5,Xyron is SO-O-O easy,"The Xyron cold laminator is absolutely the EASIEST to use product that I have seen. I did not even need the instructions to use it. It is one of the best engineered office products I have used. It is one of the simplest to use laminators. No having to wait for the machine to heat up. No stinky smells. The refills are a little pricey, but for the ease of use, it is SO worth it. I highly recommend this item."
5,Good product,"I ordered these replacement cartridges for an EZ laminator that I bought in Walmart. These are cold laminators, and they do a great job on smaller projects. These refills are 60 feet compared to the 50 feet refills I used to buy, and they were cheaper. It's a great deal!"
1,2004 American Casino Guide,"1. Found the same coupons being handed out on the street2. Unless you are traveling to different states & towns so you can use the coupons, its not worh the hassle.3. Found that the hotels/casino's offered better deals and the same offers as in the book.4. A few places would not accept the coupons.Save your money, It's not worth the hassle to carry around the whole book just to save a few bucks."
2,Some of the coupons are not so valuable...,"I am sure the book might be useful if you want to chase the match plays and free buffets at out of the way casinos, but it was not personally useful to me. I thought it would pay for itself with $10 in Free Slot Play at the Venetian, little did I know that I would have gotten $15 in Free Slot Play if I had not used the coupon. I thought that I would give eveyone a word of caution about using the Venetian Free Slot Play coupon."
3,"Good, with some flaws","While this guide is quite comprehensive, it's really more of a yellow pages for casinos than a good all-around guide. With chaning casino conditions and (in some cases) locations, this guide is a handy starting point, but you're best off researching the particulars of any casino on your own. Also, the book touts the value of the included coupons, but the majority of the coupons are worthless or contain offers that you can get by just walking into any casino."
2,Venetian/Palazzo Policy Change,"Bought this primarily for the Venetian/Palazzo $25 free play coupon. I figured this would surely make the books pay for themselves. Unfortunately, VP decided to change their policy on accepting these coupons on July 1. Venetian/Palazzo will no longer accept the $25 free play coupon as of July 1. They will gladly offer a very stylish Venetian T-shirt instead... if that is your kind of thing."
2,It Ain't What It Used To Be,"I've been buying this guide for several years. Every year the coupons are getting less useful. Perhaps the establishments are tightening up. But, I thought Vegas was in ""hard times"". You would expect them to be giving really good deals now. The 2011 book barely paid for itself. It certainly dosen't off the deals it use to. Maybe the 2012 edition will be better, but probably not. Very disapointing."
4,Good coupons,"Used this book last year and was very pleased. This year's edition does not appear to have as many buffet coupons as last year. However, for its nominal cost, you will easily recoup your money with one or two uses. I found a better buffet coupon book in the Las Vegas Advisor although it costs more, it has many more desirable eating locations. The buffet coupon for the excellant buffet at the Silverton alone is worth buying the book."
5,Worth the price,I buy the American Casino book each year. It pays for iteself with a couple coupons. I only buy it right before the trip and get it at a good price.
2,Good if you use the coupons,Bought this primarily for the Las Vegas coupons. Didn't use as many as I had hoped. Check the list carefully and consider what you will use before you buy the book.
3,American Casino Guide Review,"There is nothing in the book that you can't find pretty much on-line. However, the satistical information relating to payouts, I found somewhat informative. Keep in mind, going to a casino is for entertainment, not a source of income. Anyone who gambles on the assumption they are going to win a guaranteed jackpot, will be sadly disappointed."
3,More buffets more matchplays,"Book is OK. Need to have more Vegas Coupons included in the book. More buffets and matchplays. Otherwise, the book is average. I have seen better!"
2,Good book but not as advertised,"The content of the book was good and what I expected. However; the book was advertised as ""new."" When I received it there were pages (coupon pages) ripped out! I was very disappointed with this and it was too close to my trip to do anything about it."
1,Coupons,"I was thinking of purchasing the 2010 version of this book for the coupons..has anyone hadbetter luck with the coupons recently. We would be most interested in the Rio Buffet coupon,the Legends concert 2 for 1 and the El Cortez Steak HouseMany thanks."
1,Do not purchase this book if you are planning on using the coupons!,"I purchased this book before heading on a trip to Las Vegas. While the coupons looked to be ones we would use, none of them were excepted. The vendors and casinos all advised us that they were no longer accepting these 2009 coupons. Reasons varied, but the most common was that they caused 'too many problems'."
2,American Casino Guide,"American Casino Guide - 2010 EditionThis book is still a good source of infomation on the casinos in the USA but the coupon section has really gotten thin over the last edition and the coupons are not as good. If you buy this book for the coupons every year, you may want to rethink purchasing for this year."
3,"Value declining, need easier coupon removal, takes persistence","We all know that the only reason to buy this is for the coupons, not the info.It would be nice to have perforated coupon pages or at least an easier way to remove them.It's always a challenge to use these coupons as 75% of the places you present it to will say they've never seen it before and probably can't accept it. You fight, argue, ask to speak to a manager and they finally allow you to use but make it sound like they are doing you a favor. One pit boss even dropped the membership card that you need to show with the coupons into the cash drop box at a craps table. I had to come back the next day to get it.I say the value of the book is declining because places like the Sahara ($25 match play) are closing. You can get your money's worth out of it for sure but it's not as easy as you think."
4,Vegas,Very informative book. Anything you want to know about Las Vegas is in this book. Helpful tips for gaming and sight seeing as well.I highly recommend this book if you are planning a trip to Las Vegas.
4,American Casino Guide- 2010 Edition,"We're going to Las Vegas on a vacation and I will plan my entertainment and eating according to the coupons available. The book provides many USEFUL coupons that will help me save money and still enjoy a variety of shows, attractions and good and inexpensive restaurants as well."
2,Novice gambler,"I heard this was the essential coupon book for Las Vegas. It does give good basic information for casinos all across America, but it doesn't have as many useful coupons as I had hoped for."
2,American Casino Guide,"American Casino Guide: 2008 Edition (American Casino Guide)I was dissapointed with this book. It tries to cover everything about Casinos and gambling tips and the end result is that it provides very little in depth information about any particular casino. It also touts that it has valuable coupons. Most of the coupons are available free either on the internet or with casino coupon books that are readily available elsewhere. On the plus side there are good descriptions of casino gaming along with viable betting strategies. Overall, I wanted more detailed information on Casino attractions and deals. This book was not a good source of that type of information."
3,Good reading at least,Well I never used any of the coupons in here but it did have good tips and reading in it. It was prompt on getting here.
3,Not impressed.,"Some interesting reading information in the book, but we found ourselves going out of our way to try to use the coupons, just to try and get our money back. Spent too much time going to casinos that were out of the way and less time just relaxing and enjoing ourselves. I wouldn't suggest that people buy this books before going to vegas, usually hotels will give better coupons anyway."
2,Poor binding,My copmlaint is not with the value of the content of the book but with the terrible quality of the binding. Every time I open the book a few more pages fall out so I end up with a stack of looseleaf papers. Because we carry the book in our motorhome it gets handled more than if it was sitting on a shelf at home and even though we have learned to handle it carefully it keeps disassembling itself. We had the 2008 version and it did the same thing. They need to hire a new bookbinder.
4,Every casino you could want under one cover:,"Excellent information related to gambling, housing, and travel to various casino centers in the United States. Excellent section full of coupons for some of the casinos. The coupons alone make the book worth the price. A small investment for novitiates and veterans, both."
1,Decreased Value,"I have bought this book for several years and the bargains are not as good as they used to be.It has gone down each year. Update 2011, bought it again this year, but so disappointed in it I won't buy it next year."
4,ok with reservation,Good value.Be aware that some businesses will make it difficult to redeem coupons
5,A must have....,Have purchased an American Casino Guide Book every year that we go to Las Vegas and have been able to use a lot of the coupons in the book.....very nice to have.
3,Not much for me,"I wanted to get a coupon for Harrah's Laughlin and those paid for the book. Aquarius in Laughlin had a buffet coupon, but.... June 2010 the buffet remained closed, so my trip used 2 coupons and that was why I bought the book. Everything in is all already free on... the internet."
5,Worth it,Worth it many times over. If you hit on your free plays it's worth so much more. Know that I say the Vegas coupons alone are the reason I buy it.
3,American casino guide,The guide has some great coupons for LasVegas and Laughlin. I'm surprised there are not more two for one buffets.It is well worth the money you get your money back only if you use a couple coupons. This is the 3rd time I have bought this book and I will buy it again next year
2,2010 coupons are weak,A huge drop in the food value coupons. Buy one get one buffets Orleans Gold Coast etc...Take away the coupons sales will drop dramatically all the other info is available onlinefor 12.00 it is a fair deal
3,not as good as last year,this book used to have alot of coupons to be used in las vegas and most of the ones that we used are not in the current issue. we were dissappointed as we are seniors and enjoyed eating out with the coupons.
2,Less & Less Coupons,I buy this book every year for the coupons - Casino's are not entering coupons to this book.Sad as I used to go to Vegas 4 times a year - now I've cut my trips in half....I go to ATLANTIC CITY more often as I get better deals....
2,american casino guide,"If you're going to Las Vegas, there are enough free publications that you don't need this. If you want to know about all the casinos in the US, it's a good reference."
4,American Casino Guide,"We saved several times the cost of the book and only used a few of the coupons. All the free slot play coupons would more than pay for the book for new slot club members. Make sure you use the Ellis Island (behind Ballys) 2 for 1 coupon-ribs are great. With coupon, 2 1/2 rack baby back rib dinners with cole slaw, baked beans & bread are just $11.99. Next year we are going to buy two books."
4,Lots of great coupons,We purchased the book for the coupons and were not disappointed. It also gives some information on casino RV parking which we will use. All in all well worth the money. We even purchased a second book for our son and his wife.
3,Beware of the title,"The title is misleading (The title on the DVD is actually Red, White and Blues). There is only one chapter involving Wayne Gretzky. I was expecting much more given the title. If you like hockey this is a decent movie to watch. If you are more of a Gretzky fan, the movie may dissapoint. The 1978 Oilers/Racers is a nice bonus."
5,Sticky White Rice,"Never tried the microwavable bowls before and they were great. There are only 2 people in our house and the portions are perfect, flavor great, and the ease of cooking is terrific. Easy transaction and great service. Will do business again.Thanks,Jody Lynch"
3,"Decent rice, but it has a funny smell","The rice is a decent sticky rice, but for some reason it has a funny smell to it after microwaving. I am not sure if that is the plastic or the fact that it is not fresh.Its decent if mixed with a flavorful side dish like leftover Panang Curry."
3,Easy but it does smell awful,"This is a handy item to have around for a quick meal. After microwaving for the recommended time, it comes out hot and steaming and smells truly awful. Like some chemical off smell, might be from the packaging. But...it tastes fine once you get past that."
4,Tastes great and convenient,"This is my 2nd time ordering this product, and when it goes on sale is worth it for a single user. When I was going through chemo it came in handy to have something that was easy to fix that I could do on my own when needing just a little bit of energy."
5,Brilliant Orchestration,The City of Prague Orchestra provides powerful and very accurate renditions of the Bond movie themes. I have probably disturbed my neighbors this week but I could not help but play it at near maximum volume (a near criminal breach of the peace for this country by the way). Those expecting the original versions will not be disappointed in any way whatsoever.
2,Warning: Not the original Jive Bombers,"I linked to Amazon from a lyrics website looking for a Jive Bombers album from the 1950's. This is not it. This listed album has a Western swing type sound -- you may listen for yourself and judge it on its merits. Adding to the confusion, there is currently an Australian band that has used the same name.So, if you want the original Jive Bombers, with songs like Bad Boy, take the word of the other reviewers and keep on looking."
5,Reviews are a little mixed up,"Just reading the two reviews on this page and wow! are these guys mixed up. This band is not the 50's vocal group but a new jump blues band from Austin Tx. Of course this guy isn't going to like the record if he's expecting pop doo wop from the 50's. Did'nt he even notice the FEMAL lead volcals, which are top notch. The band swings and the recording is very authentic. The Sax leads are killer! You can dance to this one all night long!"
1,Jive Bombers Nose Dive,"It was with eager anticipation that I awaited this compliation of songs from the 50's. As I unwrapped the CD, I sang the famous Jive Bomber hit "" I'm Just A Bad Boy ....La.La La La ......."" and thought to myself that the best is yet to come. How wrong I was. This great group had somehow allowed corporate execs to dictate what cuts would make this CD....because, it surely was not the owners of the sweet dulcet tones which, for so long, emulated from the fabulous Jive Bombers. Uninspired selections and disjointed backup music detract from the groups efforts in a big way. In fact, the most inspired cut of all is the 1940's classic "" The Hucklebuck "". If the Jive Bombers ( or a knockoff group featuring one or more of the original members ) are still touring in Oldies Shows, pray that none of these selections are included in their repetoire. Bring back the Bad Boy !!!"
4,Great for the price,"Nice for the price you pay, I did buy these for a Garage Sale and they were a bit dark, which was my fault as you can see the color in the picture They did leave a little residue when I was pealing them off of items I didn't sell, but still good for the use."
4,Great...except,This album is great in all of the ways that my fellow reviewers have so eloquently stated so I won't try to expand upon their praise. My one issue with this album is the same issue I have with many Garbarek albums. The saxophone is simply too high in the mix. During his beautifully complementary swells the saxophone creeps in and then proceeds to overpower the voices. I don't know if it's an ego thing or what but this (in my opinion) mixing flaw is present throughout much of the Garbarek catalog. Otherwise a beautiful collection of deeply spiritual music.
1,Sucked,"This was a re-do of the movie themes and very poorly done at that. If you enjoyed the music from Arnold's movies, Do NOT buy the CD!"
3,Disappointing,"I got this thinking that I would get the Red Heat theme and other similar. No luck although it did include Predator, Terminator, and Commando."
3,Where's the illustrations?,"While Mr. Robinson's book is a nice description of basic comedy bits and the tricks that make them work, I thought the book cried out for illustrations. I had a difficult time understanding the directions. How much more informative the book could have been if someone had taken the time to illustrate (even stick figures) the wonderful classic moves.Still a good book. I hope they reprint it with graphics."
5,YES!!!!,"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful! Time and time again I have found the exercises in this book useful as a student of physical comedy. The book is well set out starting performers off with solo work and taking them all the way up to ensemble work, building the performers' physical vocabulary along the way. The book gives easy to follow, useful descriptions of technique. I can only hope that later editions will include step-by-step illustrations for some of the techniques. I highly recommend this book, and yes it is something you'll refer to again and again."
1,Thought for sure.....,"That this titled book would come with either at least black and white picture samples,or diragram type drawings to show us clearly how to do the lessons inside said book."
1,less than I expected to say the least!,Please make sure you realize this is just a toy! To be able to use it for playing at a minimum you will need to replace the strings and the bridge. However the case is decent.
5,Violinsmart Natural Color Student Violin Size 3/4,It is a wonderful violin. The qaulity was better than I expected it to be.
4,Works as expected,I used it for a wound on my foot. be sure to leave the ends long to come up around your foot or the ends curl and get pulled off easily.
4,Useful for Blister Prevention,"I bought this tape to put on my heels to prevent blisters, which it does very well. It is ""waterproof"" only because it does not come off when it is wet. My skin do not feel dry underneath the tape, however. It does not stick too well either. After two to three days, part of it (usually around the ends) would become unstuck and would come off when I took my socks off."
4,"Good product, much cheaper at Target","Great product. I assumed that as an Amazon add-on, the price of $5 would be a bargain. I couldn't remember how much I usually pay for it. Unfortunately, I saw it at Target today for their regular price of ~$3.50. I won't buy it from Amazon again."
2,Not waterproof,I'm not impressed with this. Even though I carefully wrap this I have to replace it 2-3 times a day with normal handwashing.
4,Globe Flush mount ceiling fixture,"I chose this fixture so that I could have 3 directional heads to illuminate some darker areas of the room it was going to be used in. It is a beautiful fixture and was easy to install. The only downside for it was that it takes 3 40W G9 (check description) halogen bulbs. These bulbs are expensive ($3 + each) if you buy them locally (even through a big-box home store). I did find a set of 10 (3 to use, plus extras) on Ebay for a fantastic price.. about $1.25 each (10 for $7.50 + $5.00 shipping). After I got the bulbs in, I think I would have liked to have a brighter light, but halogen bulbs get hot, so that is probably why the recommended bulb is 40W."
2,fall apart,"I own a set of these knives and the handle material has ""melted"" off and is a mess! I had them for about 18 months before I noticed the problem starting on one of the knives. I thought it had been laid down on a hot surface or something but then the others started the same problem. The black part just comes apart and leaves a sticky residue on your hands!I had no luck in resolving this issue with Cold Steel so the knives have been banished to the garage as a ""project"" to someday put a wood handle on them. (yeah right, I just hate to throw them away!) I really like the blade but the handle material failed me.I would guess they were not dishwasher safe."
5,Very good album,"I think Mr. Karlsson's playing is great, and his compositions are very interesting, in their complex harmonic structure, most of them. My favorite is the ballad Blue Sky has a very nice harmony with a great melody and an unusual 19 bar form. I think Mr. Karlsson is one of those special musicians who can find deep ideas to innovate and to bring us(jazz fans) great emotion."
1,Dumb Stuff,"This is one of those really weird books you pick up now and again in the fiction section thinking you've got an entertaining book. Not so. This book is just plain off the wall. Space aliens from another planet intermixed apes and aliens to get our Hooey, Looey and Dooey of the 20th century - yeah right! The pyramids were traffic signs for spacecraft and much much more - com'on down and buy you some snake oil ma' friend. This is the dumbest thing I've come across since Alien Autopsy. The Phoenix Solution was much much better. Drive past this rot and pick that up - you won't be disappointed with Phoenix"
3,OK,"Not bad if you are interested in ancient myth, but the linking them to a Planet X, I have a little trouble with that the theory"
3,interesting book,"I enjoyed reading this book.But at times, i had the impression that the theories put forward are too good to be true.At least someone tried hard to explain them in an honest way and not in a commercial way. Although Alan alford research was extensive,it referred to Islam on very few occasions.I am aware that this book is not about religions as such,but you will be surprised to see that islam offers explanations to many issues raised in this book. I am eager to read more books to Alan Alford"
4,You can do better,Kino put out a 9 disc set (9 movie) David Lean collection that sells for about the same price. A much better deal.
1,Do NOT BUY!,"Waste of money...we bought this to replace our old nerf style football that we use in the water when we go out on our boat. This football is horrible. It has ""holes"" in it for taking in water which then make it weigh a ton so you can't throw it! Also, after only about 15 minutes of use the football ripped along many of the holes and started to fall apart! I am packing it up tomorrow and sending it back for a refund."
1,Wrong product delivered,"They sent me the wrong size. It was 27,5, not 27,0 mm as advertised and not suitable for my camcorder. I live ouside US, so I can not give it back to the seller!!.BEWARE!!!!"
3,so so,"if you are wanting to read this i'd buy it used. its so so, only for really big fans of wolverine."
5,A Worthwhile Read,"Our hyperactive, bottom-line culture sends lots of confusing mixed messages about what it means to be a ""real"" man. These poems feel like brightly lit cairns that mark the anguished battles Reid Baer has fought along his path to open-hearted, courageous masculinity.- Bill Mawhinney, author of Songs In My Begging Bowl"
4,Pressed Flowers : Decorative Projects to Enhance the Home,"The author shows how pressed flowers can be used to enliven household objects, create unique gifts, ornaments, decorated candles & vases, and instructions to make gift bags & tags with advice on equipment and materials to press flowers, make your own flower press and preserve pressed flowers. 96 pages"
4,Good for beginner,"Twelve weeks seemed too short for a half or full Ironman to me, but I am a beginner so we will see 3 months from now. What I like about the training plans is there is a train to finish plan and train for perfomance plan for each distance. The strength training chapter is good because it has lots of pictures. The chapter on swiming is limited because he suggests you buy a training DVD, which I had done previously."
4,help to get through a triathlon,this book is a good read for someone who is contemplating a triathlon. it sets up a basic and challenging schedule to get you ready for what you want to achieve. one thing i learned is that you should be in pretty good condition before you attempt even a beginner tri.
3,Good for shorter distances only,"This is a very friendly book to introduce newbies to triathlon. I used it in training for a sprint and an Olympic. After a year under my belt, I'm now starting to train 5 months out for half Ironman. There's absolutely no way I'd train for a HIM in only 12 weeks. If you're training for a HIM or IM, you should be more advanced than this book and you probably know that you need more than 12 weeks to train. If you're doing a sprint or Olympic and want a lot of basic advice on preparing for your first race, this is a good book.Overall I'd give it 5 stars as a newbie book, but only 1 star for giving people the idea that they can train for a HIM or IM in only 12 weeks. I think it's irresponsible. If you're already very fit and very trained, then maybe. But he doesn't have those caveats in here."
4,very helpful guideline,"To train for a triathlon in just three months time might sound very unreasonable. However, this book is not pushing the boundaries beyond extremes. Anybody finds her/his limits. I liked very much: the resistance program (including stretching) and the really helpful hints."
4,Good range of difficuly levels,"I really like the patterns in this book. The designs range from simple patterns that could be used as suncatchers to more elaborate designs with over 100 cuts a lot of which are concave. Some patterns would look best with jewels and seemed to be designed for them.Some of the patterns presented are just variations of one another. So, there aren't quite as many patterns as the product descrption might imply. However, there was a lot of variety packed into this book.I feel like this book was a good value."
2,Too stylized,"This book certainly has a lot of patterns, but the flowers are very stylized--like Early Americana. Not what I was expecting."
4,"Easiest to use, questions are in question","This is by far the simplest out of the 3 other books I have already completed. However, comparing this one to the others these questions seem to be less likely to be on a police exam (at least for CT), and a lot of the questions asked are not clear. Good book if your starting out, but won't help that much if your test taking veteran like myself. Judgment and oral board questions are best in Larry Jetmore's police exam guide, and the Barron's police guide has excellent memorization and recognition tests that will definitely be on your test. I suggest you buy as many preparation guides as you can for just over $10 since it goes without saying how expensive these police exams are today. ($25-75)"
2,youdontmesswithmygrandchildren,"I have no complaints with Amazon, but I do have a problem with clickntoys (the vendor I purchased from). The doll is WONDERFUL and my grand daughter loves her. It is just a shame that I had to buy it from a retail store. The doll that I ordered was NOT delivered in a timely manner (27 days for delivery)and when it was delivered I returned it because it arrived to late. I contacted the vendor asking that my money be refunded and it was.I had many email conversations with the vendor during this transaction and in each was ask that I give a favorable review. The only thing favorable I can say is that my money was refunded promptly.I rely a great deal on reviews and comments from consumers concerning products and vendors. I do hope that this comment makes at least 1 person stop and think about using this clickntoys.The stars that I have given Tasha are not for the toy itself but for the vendor. I say again, the toy is WONDERFUL."
5,Whoa,"This book was very fun to read. I really didn't relate to it at first because I didn't understand the characters; I didn't understand how people could be so childish, but I guess that's what having filthy rich parents does to a person. When I saw the movie I understood better what Fitzgerald tried to get across in the book, even though the movie wasn't that great. Then I read the book again and enjoyed it a lot more. It is very, very good, a perfect representation of what I felt about the life and characters of the '20s."
1,Buena esa Maestro!,"El Álbum tiene varios componentes que lo hacen muy bueno y otros que no lo dejan ser perfecto.Los buenos componentes: musicalmente muy bueno (melódicamente y armónicamente espectacular, improvisaciones excelentes, composiciones deslumbrantes)y excelentes músicos (sobretodo el maestro Antonio Serrano, cuyas improvisaciones lo ratifican como uno de los mejores músicos de España y de todo el Mundo).Los no tan buenos componentes: algunas canciones muy lentas y otras demasiado improvisadas, a tal punto que incurren en faltas musicales a las que no nos tiene aconstumbrado el Maestro (sobretodo en la canción con Tomatito, la cual se vueleve monótona y termina de una forma un poco extraña).Aun así, este es una joya que usted debe conseguir e igualmente con la cual empezará a seguirle la pista a los músicos que en ella participan.♥"
1,Smaller than I expected,"It's a ok blender jar but I hate that I have to blend my green smoothies in sections because it will make a big mess, especially if you don't hold down the lid. Twice since my purchase it exploded over every thing including my walls, because I didn't babysit it and hold the lid down, I shouldn't have to :-("
4,Zed - 'Visions Of Dune' (Spalax),"Until recently, I've never even remotely heard of this French 'electronic progressive' artist. Zed is basically a one-man project, being the brainchild of Bernard Szajner - who provides the synthesizer, digital sequences and laser generator on this CD reissue, that the lp was originally released in 1979. Liked what I heard. Tunes I dug the most were ""Dune"", ""Kwizata Haderach"" and the disc's two lengthiest cuts - ""Bene Gesserit"" and Shai Hulud"" (both run seven minutes). Also, thought that ""Fremen"" sort of stood out because it's pretty spaced out. Just might possibly appeal to fans of Tangerine Dream, Archaia, Heldon and Gong. A worth pick."
4,Laswell at his finest.,"This ain't no Buena Vista Social Club! This CD is an amazing combination of straight-laced field recordings, dub experiments, drum-n-bass frenzies, and ambient textures--all through the guise of Havana's musical culture. Every bit of music (excepting hip-hop) that Laswell has had his hand in over the past decade is represented and mutated brilliantly. ""Deconstructing Havana"" indeed!"
5,Greatest Tom Petty creation ever.,"The CD was nearly perfect in its content as well as its structural format. The title song ""It's Good To Be King"" had two slighly different versions stacked back to back and this permitted me to press the 'STOP' button right after the end of the second song and then press 'PLAY' again to give me a nearly nonstop loop of the title song into virtual infinity. Altogether it is a truly extraordinary music listening experience. Finally, I feel very fortunate to have been able to make this purchase through Amazon."
3,Super Pet My First Home - large Review,"I purchased the large Super Pet My First Home for my rabbit. This cage provides him with plenty of room to hop around and lay out comfortably. My nibbler can't nibble through those double-coated white wires.My last rabbit cage had an opening in the top which allowed me to clean out the cage without lifting out the entire top. You might find it difficult to clean out the Super Pet cage through the small front opening. It would probably be easier to remove the entire top. Also, the Super Pet cage does not have reinforced sides. I have secured the ends of my cage with binding to prevent bunny from getting out when I'm not around.The base is made of a lightweight plastic and is easy to clean."
3,Turned out to be diferent than what expected.,"There are many books about holocoust survivors during the war years and inmediatly after, but there ae not many who talk about this subject in a totally setting (miami) and 50 years after the war, wich makes th book interesting.Unfortunatly I think this book is more about police,detectives and shooting than anything else.However, I think the book repeats the same information already given to the reader over and over which makes it a little boring.Being spanish my first language, I would like to tell the author that the idea of including spanish sentences and words every now and then is not a bad idea, however please have it check out by a native speaker because the number of grammar mistakes is amazing!!!"
3,Average,"The book was pretty good, but seemingly incredible. The antagonist was a presumably 70 year old man who somehow struck fear in the heart of a 30 year-old Miami detective. It's entertaining, but by no means did it live up to the expectations."
3,A Big disapointment,After reading Just cause that was unbelievable good I had huge expectations from this book. However this book is not as half as good as Just Cause. It starts good and then the story keeps deteriorating and becomes unreliable and unrealistic. That is a shame since the idea is very good and the author has proven that he knows how to write.
5,"A thriller, gripping",This Book is a definate page turner. Each chapter is full of exitment and intrige. I recomend it to any one who likes thrilling books.
2,RUNS SMALL,This shoe is well made but runs small. I suggest for a better fit purchase a half size larger.
4,Very Helpful,"This solutions guide accompanies probably one of the worst user-rated Linear Algebra textbooks. I was assigned this text for my linear algebra class, and found after the first two chapters that the book does not provide enough examples to help guide you through the homework. After buying this book, I was able to thoroughly understand concepts that were lost on me after reading the text alone. I recommend this solutions manual for anybody who gets stuck with this textbook."
4,"Great Book, Great Problems (Hints - Give away)","I bought this book to supplement Strang's Linear Algebra and its Applications and wound up switching over to this book. Good coverage of important topics. Concentrates on giving the reader some geometrical insight which might turn off some but which I personally liked.About 4 sections per Chapter. Each section has 50 problems. A lot of them are number substitution or fact manipulation. A few of them are really ""nice"" problems. However the author gives away the entire solution in his ""hints"". He should have put them at the end of the book. So if you want a challenge avoid the hints.Overall a great book."
4,A solid straightforward treatment,I thought this was a reasonablly good book. I am baffled by some of the bad reviews. I found nothing about this book that was consistent with the bad reviews posted here. I do not have a great deal of experience with other linear algebra books (not being familiar with many other L.A. texts prevented me from giving it 5 stars). Nevertheless the book is quite solid by my estimation. I can only guess that some of the other reviewers are expecting too much from their textbooks. Any text requires the individual to bring at least some effort to it.
1,unclear and poorly organized!!!,"This book is unclear, boring, and horribly organized. Most of the essential/important examples and proofs are left as excercises for the student. The most annoying thing about the book is that it leaves the student with a very vague understanding of the concepts and for some strange reason, it partly clarifies them in the next section or chapter. Too bad the student always gets stuck with doing homework on a section he vaguely understands."
2,Not that Great,"Don't waste your money on this book. It says ""solution manual"" but really it's only an ""odd numbered problem solution manual"" and the back of the actual text book has those answers. All you're getting is about a sentence of explanation in addition with this book. Total scam and rip off."
3,Abstraction vs Technique,"Over all Linear Algebra by Bretscher is a fairly good book. The material in the book is a relatively good read and is done rather nicely (my professor does seem to do a slightly better job in his delineation though). The exercises seem to be the crux of the problem for me, and for most people it seems. Bretscher seems to have more conceptual material then technique in his book. It becomes rather difficult to solve problems when only a theoretical structure is around to help you. A combination of the two would be a nice addition.Over all not a very bad book."
1,waste of time and money,This book is anything but comprehensive. It is definitely written for someone who is already familiar with Matrix Algebra. Don't spend your money on this worthless book. Linear Algebra is a beautiful branch of mathematics and this book does NO justice to it.
1,The WORST,This was perhaps the most poorly written textbook I've ever encountered. Theorems weren't defined completely or clearly. There were problems whose solution methods could in no way be extrapolated from the text alone; I had to use several other books. I recommend not buying this book unless it's required for a class. I'm sure there are many better references or self-teaching books out there.
1,Too Complicated,"This is THE worst math book I have seen in my student career. It assumes that the student knows most of the stuff, and then just goes on to provide examples based on those assumptions. I would not recommend this to anyone who is just starting out on linear algebra as this book nearly destroyed my grades. If it weren't for another algebra book, which was much easier to understand, I wouldn't have been so lucky. Definitely one of the worst out there !"
1,Pretty Bad....,"I have taken many math classes in my career (I am currently a graduate student in statistics) and I would have to say this is one of the worst texbooks for introductory linear algebra out there. This book was assigned in an introductory linear algebra course at Cornell and if it weren't for other, much better linear algebra books, I would not have done well at all. One of the main flaws with this book is the lack of concrete examples, which in itself is enough to make it a terrible introductory text, but in addition, the study guide ironically gives detailed answers to relatively easy questions but NO explanation AT ALL of difficult, more theoretical exercises. The only reason that I can figure as to why this book is so popular among good universities is that they are trying to give students a hard time early on, perhaps to discourage them from taking further mathematics courses. I feel great pity for those that have the misfortune of being taught linear algebra with this book."
1,Crap on a Stick,"This book skips steps especially in the beginning. Homework answers are often just a fact. Lacks a precise algorithm in helping students learn. Wish the teacher in this class is good, cause this book is wack. BEWARE!"
1,the details of the computation are left to the reader,"What an awful book! The book omits so many steps and uses so many shortcuts that I think otto is just showing off and has no interest in teaching an entry level student anything. The solutions manual is even more worthless; 75% of the time it gives the answer only which can be found in the back of the textbook! Awful, horrid, and a shame I bought it."
2,Confusing Waste of Money,"I should have read the reviews here before purchasing this book. It is a required text for my Linear Algebra class, but I haven't been able to use it at all. A few examples are given at the start of each section, so the reader would naturally assume that the problems would be related to the examples...but they are not. The reader is left to himself to somehow brainstorm all of the necessary theorems. This is really a ridiculous text. To anyone buying this book for a class, I advise purchasing only the Student Solutions Manual... I know it is where I am doing all of my learning from."
3,"Good for math majors, bad for non-math majors","A good book if you have tons of time on hand. The information in the text is very good, but it's extremely confusing and hard to understand. All examples are too short and vague, which means you can't get it by staring at it. The book expects you to understand abstract examples that applies to nothing, which can be very difficult for non-math people. I had to use this book for my linear algebrea class, and the experience was bitter. Book uses mainly direct proofs, it lacks diveristy in methods of proofs.If you are like me, an engineering major, then this book is a bad choice. However, if you are math major, then this book will do you a lot of good."
4,Same as newer edition,"As far as I can tell this is exactly the same as the newer edition. Presents the information in a reasonable matter, but there are better books out there."
1,Horrible,"I'm just starting out in this class and the book is a mess. I'm no friend of math, but this book is not student friendly in the least."
1,Disappointing,"I expected a lot of this book since it was published by the Lonely Planet, whose guidebooks I swear by. The book consisted of very little travel and seemed dominated by the author's whinging about discomforts and his failures at love.Most books make you want to go to places the author went to despite the problems that come up, but this one put me off of going to any of the places the author recommends.I pictured the author as Niles Craine, (as in Frazier's brother on TV). Not the sort suited to adventure travel."
1,I Don't Think So,"One of the dumbest books I have ever read. Fowler does OK, just OK, when she writes of the more recent history of the diamond because she has well-documented information from which to draw. But, in her chronicles of the stone during the early years of its murky existence, she lets her imagination run wild, her prose becomes over-blown and turgid, and ""facts"" she throws about are questionable in the extreme. Ghastly, ghastly writing. Do NOT buy this book!"
3,lacks sparkle,"There isn't a lot that could have done to make this more interesting, and the attempts made at conjecture and embellishment (regarding its curse, for example) don't add very much to the content. But, a reader does learn the story of the Hope Diamond and through the telling, about an interesting mix of historical information such as the French Revolution, Regency England, and Gilded Age America. And gem novices can learn about the nature of diamonds and of cultural attitudes to diamonds at various places and times in this book."
3,Somewhat entertaining,"The most interesting part of this book for me was a glimpse into the lives of French kings who owned the diamond. For the most part, the first 3/4 of the book were a good read. I liked the way the diamond was personified, but didn't care for the way the curse was dramatized, as there was quite frankly little evidence to suggest such a curse. In the more modern history of the diamond, the book starts to become boring, I don't need so many words to tell me that Harry Winston planned not to cut the diamond at all, but changed his mind later and cut it anyway. If you have the time and are interested in the history of the diamond, read the first part of the book and skim through the rest."
2,good music ruined by poor orchestration,"I bought the disk because I love the romantic music of John Barry. However, after listening to it, I was annoyed at the poor production values. Instead of soaring romantic themes, I heard uneven playing, with a strong emphasis on the beat similar to the amateurs who play in our local high school orchestra. You could imagine the conductor saying: one two three four. To make things worse, there were some sour notes.In short, if you know nothing about music, and enjoy movie soundtracts, you'll like this. However, if your ability to enjoy music is the level of the average high school musician, try another record."
1,Awful recordings of great music,This is perhaps the worst CD I have ever purchased. The conducting is atrocious and on some tracks the instruments actually sound of tune.Consider other full length John Barry soundtracks instead.
1,Misleading,CD cover would lead you to believe it is the soundtrack from Out of Africa. Not. It is a collection of John Barry scores only 1 of which is from Out of Africa. Weak
5,fun toy,"My doughter that is five and a half just love Pet shop, and she is playing a lot with this house, we bought it at target for thirty five dollar, and the game at Walmart for 13 dollar, fifty dollar for both of them. The game are fun, even for me, the house is supposed to spin around, but this has not worked so good, but my girl does not care aboute this so much. Otherwise it seemse to bee in good quality, she have had it for over 6 month, and play a lot with it, it did not broke."
2,Celestial Seasoning Decaf Victorian Earl Grey Tea,This tea does not have the same flavor and scent as the tea in the regular (not decaf) K-cups which I've tasted before and thought I would buy it. It is rather ordinary and without taste. I will not purchase it again.
1,Outdated and hard to use,"This is one of 7 instruction books I ordered from Amazon and is the least useful. It clearly needs new editing and printing. Use the Alfred series and Norman Monath's ""How to play Popular Piano in 10 easy lessons"". Also get the two fake books by Hal Leonard: The First Fake Book and the Easy Fake Book. See my review for the First Fake Book."
4,Too clever by half,Overall a good work on learning to make and enjoy homemade music. The style of prose is dated and too flippant for my tastes. Buy it anyway and go for content rather than entertainment.
4,How to Play Despite Years of Lessons,"I haven't had the chance to work with this book yet, but it seems very thorough. The kind of book that you return to many times, not just one read/study."
2,A reference only,"I am a professional musician who has more than 50 years all kind of musical instruments playing experience. I learnt every instruments (Guitar, Piano, Violin, Sax, Flute... you name it) from the books and by watching people playing. My personal opion is this book can only read as a reference book, it doesn't teach you much. The title ""..Despite years of lessons"" seems kinda wrong. If the reader already had years of lessons or playing experience, they could figure it out or they are already playing like this. If you are a first time learner you don't know what this book is talking about without any musical theroy. Anyway the first 1/4 of this book is very helpful."
2,How To Play Piano Despite Years of Lessons,"I was disappointed that this book does not actually show you how to play the piano. There is a lot of theory in the book, but nothing to actually help me with my piano lessons."
4,An Excellent Book,"This worthwhile book, while not a beginner's book (as the title tells you), is packed with detailed information not found in other books. It is excellent for gaining an overall, general understanding of how music is constructed, and thus, played. It goes beyond the other two available ""how to play from fake books"" books; for example, the sections on different chord progressions are unique. Granted, the musical samples may be old-fashioned (1930-1975), but that doesn't invalidate them as exercises illustrating a point."
2,"Book, but no audio cd included","I paid for both the book and the audio cd, but the cd was not included when shipped. I would like for the cd to be shipped seperately at no cost.Book did arrive in great condition and very soon after purchase."
2,Disk scratched up pretty badly; book good,"I was disappointed to find the disk so badly scratched. I specifically chose this set to buy because I saw no indication that there would be a problem with the disk. The book, at least, was in good shape."
2,Not a finished product,"This ""Live"" recording is a sub-par crapola recording done on a cassette or personal digital recorder that got released because someone wanted to make some money. If Buzzy Feiten ""produced"" this as the liner notes indicate, he should never be enlisted as a producer in any capacity. If you are desperate to hear Neil Larsen live, buy his own ""orbit"" CD recorded live in an empty club. That recording is excellent, this CD is pure crap. The band probably sounded great in the club but this recording doesn't do them justice. FYI: I am a die-hard fan of Buzz Feiten but this CD is a rip-off!!"
3,Nice reference for a beginner,"Contrary to the first review of this book, I ordered it anyway & feel that once you understand the concept of it (what to do each season of the year rather than in general) it can be a great help, especially to beginners. It tends to read like a novel with headings alphabetically arranged in each season. I very much like this book. It would be great for those who like to read the entire book instead of having neat headings for each topic."
1,Horrible and pointless,There is absolutely no point to this movie. It's not funny and there is no real story line. Don't waste your time on this one.
4,Very Funny.,"I thought this movie was hilarious the first time that I had watched it. It's not for everyone, but if you are looking for a good movie to watch on the weekend and you are looking for a comedy to watch. I would suggest this one, since I personally liked it and I'm definitely into comedies. I absolutely loved the parts where they were going to Oakland. :)Recommending the movie to some of my friends."
1,Totally improved movie that is not funny.,"""I'm not a drug dealer, I'm an artist."" Glenn ""Fitz"" Fitzgerald's lifeis starting to fall apart. His band is breaking up and he watches hisformer mates find success while he is stuck at home selling pot to makemoney. This may be my shortest review ever. This movie is 100%improved. Unlike movies like ""Best In Show"", ""Mighty Wind"", and most ofWill Ferrell's movies this one is not funny. It may be because I'm tooold but this is not my type of movie and I thought it was lame andboring. Overall, not for me. I give it a D."
1,What is wrong with you people?,"You call this poetry? A friend gave me this pile of swill as an ""inspirational"" present. It inspired me not to be friends with him anymore. Give me a break, y'all. This isn't poetry. This is cliche-ridden, illiterate ramblings. If you are going to pretend to be intelligent and read poetry, at least pretend to read something good. I suggest A. R. Ammons. Oh wait, I forgot, oops, sorry. Reading him makes you think."
4,"Good, but...","This is a touching book, don't get me wrong. The quality that I would expect from Javan is present. However, after having read ""Something to Someone"" I feel as if the rest of his books are somewhat lacking. I couldn't tell you exactly what it is that its missing, but it is. Still a wonderful read, and I would still buy it again. Just a forewarning if you weren't already a big fan."
2,One of them might be fake will update shortly,I got these earring as a amazon deal of the day. Took out the diamond tester to test if they are real diamonds. One of them beeps to signal it is a genuine diamond. The other earring says it made out of some other material. It give off the sound of metal. I did the test numerous times on these earrings as well as check to see if the diamond tester was working... I think its a classic bait and switch. Im going to take it to a diamond expert to double check
2,Waste of Money,"A bit disappointed with this item, the backing is a bit loose and on several occasions, it fell off easily. Furthermore, I do not see much sparkle in this item. Does not do justice to the amount spent."
3,earrings,"I was happy with the stone size, but the settings were rather chinzy. The backs are really small, and dig into your ear lobe, but once I put better backs on them, they were fine."
3,1 cttw Black diamonds,This diamond earrings are much smaller than I expected. I have white diamonds that are 1 cttw. and these are so much smaller. I have the 1/2 cttw. and they are almost the same size.
1,14K White gold Balck Diamond Stud Earring (.5cttw),"I think Amazon needs a ""life-size"" photo when they offer these deals. Even though they clearly stated .5cttw I wasn't prepared for just how small that would be. Looking at the photo in the ad it appeared they would be an acceptable size.I returned the item."
2,Black Diamond Earrings,Did not like the Black Diamond Earrings. They are supposed to be 14K but did not look like it. Returned them.
2,Not quite as expected,I purchased these for my wife but was really disappointed. She expected diamonds of any kind to be translucent but these have none. The could be a couple of chunks of obsidian. Not sure I will buy jewerly on-line again.
2,earrings,"The earrings were shown to be a little larger than they really were, so in the future know what a carrot really looks like."
1,Poor Product,"I was very disaponted in these earings. They were very small and not worth the price. They listed that they originally soldfor $715. If that was the case, they should have had a certificate of authenticity. Needless to say I have returned them.Anne C.Warwick, RI"
3,Product OK,I am satisified with this product....ordered it with 2 others for Valentines day and this is the only product that made it
1,Black Diamonds,"Does anyone really realize what they're buying here? Black diamonds are really crappy diamonds that have been placed in a nuclear reactor. The black color results from the diamonds being bombarded by intense neutron radiation. This makes the diamonds radioactive, and have to be stored until their radioactivity dies out. Only then are they sent to market. The main point here, however, is you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear--in other words, ""Garbage in, garbage out."""
4,A good value purchase,"I purchased these for my wife and she loves them. When they arrived, I thought they were smaller than one carat each. I took them to my local jeweler and he confirmed they were each one carat. The black diamonds appear smaller than their one carat white counterparts. These are very attractively priced."
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to receive these earrings at such a great price and with such great reviews. However, I was filled with disappointment once I received them. One of the diamonds is chipped on the side and the other has a hazy water spot stain right in the middle of it. On top of that, the diamonds have hardly any luster or sparkle. Needless to say, they are being returned."
3,Disappointment,"These diamonds resembled faceted hematite which costs a fraction of this pair. Not at all what was expected; post was also bent when received.UPDATE: I have since purchased black diamond studs which are gorgeous and far superior to these in construction and quality of the settings and the stones. Nice black diamonds are truly lovely, especially in white gold settings and I'd recommend getting at least the 1cttw to really show off the dark beauty. As with white diamonds, the closer in match of the pair, the better, and the pair I'd originally received were on all counts inferior stones as was the setting."
5,A Good Deal,I bought the earrings from the Ligntning Deal for $129.99. It's a real bargain. The black diamond is shiny and has a good reflection. I love the earrings very much. The size is perfect for me. Please keep in mind that the black diamond has a small table top. Even the total weight is 2 ct the table top is much smaller than other diamonds.
1,Total Rip Off -- Deserves Zero Stars,"I did not expect high quality stones due to the price, but I certainly didn't expect such horrible quality.Both stones and dull and extremely cloudy. They also have huge inclusions right on their surfaces. They are gray in color (not close to black as shown in the picture). One is darker than the other. Even though their color would hide most flaws, the quality is so obviously poor it would be embarrassing for anyone to wear them.I also would like to note that the white gold settings are not as shown in the picture. The stones are propped up on top of settings so the white gold cannot be seen on the perimeter when viewed directly from the front.I ordered them a couple of days ago but now when I view the item, it says ""Item under review"" due to customer feedback. I'm guessing other customers have complained about being sent two lumps of coal too!!Returning immediately. Not worth more than $10. You're better off buying something made of plastic from a bead store."
1,Completely Unsatisfied,"I have already sent these back to the seller. When I received these earrings, they looked like they had been scratched and along the prongs it looked as if there was glue, or maybe they were just really dirty. Either way I returned them within 10 minutes of receiving them. I later found out that Black Diamonds are just that way, unless you buy high quality, basically flaweless, this is what you can expect to see. With that said, these earrings were too flawed for me to give to my wife. I thought for the price it was a steal, but turned out to be too good to be true. On a positive there wasn't any hassle with returning these."
4,Simple Yet Stunning,"These earrings are wonderful. I purchased a pair for my birthday and I LOVE them. I always get compliments on them, in fact my mom, sister-in-law, and best friend now own a pair too. The only downside is that jewelry makers often put black diamonds with white gold so it's kind of difficult to find complimentary pieces, although I have managed to find matching pieces over time."
5,Beautiful!!,"Great quality. Size,cut,color,mounting,all super. Hard to find in yellow gold mounts-Surprisingly nice presentation box was a real gift time plus.Only con is they would be even nicer with screwback posts but post & friction will do.. Still 5 stars!"
2,Small!,"I was able to take advantage of a deep discounted sale on these. I knew not to expect much, but I've never seen a black diamond before, so I was intrigued.When I got the earrings, they looked ok (I plan to add some diamond jackets in the future), but way smaller than anticipated. I really don't think the ""1 cttw"" is accurate. 1/2 ct stones are larger than these. In any case, you do get what you pay for, and they seem to be a fair value at the price I paid. At full price, these babies would have taken a round trip!"
3,Black Diamond earrings,"These earrings seem small for one crt each. It could be the darker color. I was expecting them to be broader. If you are looking for black diamonds, the cut and setting are a nice quality, just be aware of the surface size."
4,lovely earrings,"My husband bought me these earrings for our anniversary.Pros: From the picture, I thought they would be a little old-fashioned, but they are very stylish and go with everything, from dressy to casual. They look elegant but not flashy. The size is perfect; I wouldn't recommend ordering the smaller size.Cons: There is a little ding on the side of one of the stones (not that I expect anyone to get close enough to my ear to notice!), and I wish the earrings had come with some sort of certificate of authenticity or diamond rating card."
2,Guess You get what You pay for...,"The table of each earring had multiple inclusions (inclusion is a characteristic enclosed within a gemstone), I returned one set as they were so bad the inclusions dominated the table - the 2nd set was a bit better but far from what I would classify as ""good"""
3,Black Diamond Ear rings,You get what you pay for. The first set I received had visible cracks. I returned them and the next set was better. My wife didn't like them so I ultimately returned that set as well.
5,Elegant jewelry,"I returned a pair of black diamond studs (that were actually less expensive than these) but decided to take a chance on ordering them again, since other reviewers made me think it was a matter of chance to get a ""good"" pair. I'm very glad I did. The second pair are shallower and a little wider, though still 2 cttw, and are much more sparkly and clearer. They are still black, but seem to reflect from colors around, or from what else I am wearing. I really like them."
1,Sorely disappointed.,"The price was too good to be true. One of the earrings had a chip in it and the other had a cloudy stain on it. They also lacked brilliance and sparkle. I returned them, sorely disappointed."
3,A tantalizing rag-bag,"A collection that promises much but proves repetitive and unsatisfying. The pieces were mostly aimed at a broad popular audience and contain little to interest today's more informed cinema-lovers. The account of the technical challenges posed by ""Rope"", though, is fascinating and almost worth the price of admission by itself. Most Hitchcock buffs will be better off with Truffaut's book of interviews"
4,Good,"This book was a good entertaining read that provided fascinating information, but did not get bogged down in the process."
2,The Master of Suspense becomes Master of Boredom,"I'm a huge fan of Hitchcock movies and wanted read more about him. I was greatly disappointed with this book though. Like others have said, it is repetitive to the point of insanity. After I read the first half of the book I found myself just jumping ahead to parts of interest just so I could get the dang thing done with. Whoever put this thing together obviously had even less patience and regard for this book than I the reader. While there were a chapter or two that were interesting, overall it wasn't worth the time or effort."
2,Overrated,"I was a huge fan of the original Twisted Metal games, but this one is just ridiculous. A fundamental flaw in the game is the car acceleration rates. One second you have a car in your sights, and the next that car has apparently jumped into warp speed and has disappeared from the screen. The game is impossible to play with this flaw."
1,not the same,dont be fooled. it may be called tisted metal but it is almost entirely different. almost all new characters. Calypso is not the sames as from 1 - 4. he's an old bald dude with a warped face that doesnt talk in the game and kills at least one person with a gun. all the competors come from a prison as well. if you liked the orginal series especially twisted metal 3 stay away from this one. the levels suck too.
5,"Ooh, Spooky","Wow, what a cool book! I read the whole thing twice! The story is really exciting. If you haven't got this book, you need to pick it up and read it with your kid right away. I heard that she's writing a sequel, I can hardly wait. Read it!"
4,Great music from a legend.,"The only reason this is 4 stars is that there should have been more. What about Liberty Valence, Big Jake, North to Alaska, The Shootist, Chisum, Hondo, Wake of the Red Witch, Reap the Wild Wind, etc.There are millions of John Wayne fans! Is anyone listening out there!Otherwise, this CD is a must for John Wayne fans."
3,Not Enough,"Where's the fabulous ""Red River"" Theme by Dimitri Tiomkin? Where's ""My Rifle, Pony and Me""(same melody as ""Red River"")from Rio Bravo? What about the great music from ""Rio Grande?"" Well there all available but on seperate cd's. It's very frutrating. Maybe some day somebody will do it right. The Wayne family should do something about it.I'm glad to see the music from ""She Wore a yellow Ribbon"" is included on this cd. When the heck is that film going to be release on DVD?"
4,A good path to physical optics and imaging theory,"This book is cleary written. The basic theory of Fourier transform is included too. Fourier optics is a very strong tool in imaging and optics. I would say Goodman is an enginnering guy, but some physical insight is not very clear. Diffraction theory is easier to understand than J.D. Jackson's E&M. And the whole book is easier to read than Born and Wolf's Principle of Optics and has more details. After all, it is a good book for Fourier opitcs. But the price is too high."
5,Provides the necessary background for diffraction physics,"I read this book thirty years ago in order to get up to speed on Fresnel diffraction and the Kirchhoff integral as discussed in John Cowley's seminal work ""Diffraction Physics"". Indeed, this book is recommended by Cowley as a necessary prerequisite. Goodman does a good job laying the groundwork for Fresnal diffraction, complete with a detailed exploration of the boundary conditions. After reading the first several chapters of this book, the reader should be ready to tackle Cowley."
4,"A very nice book , but nothing is ever perfect...","Overall I like the book for it is clear, the mathematics is lucid and has all the essentials in a comprehensive way. I have found it quite useful for research. In addition, for the most parts it is quite accurate.Some criticisms though:Contains everything from a more mathematical point of view. By that i mean, problems are usually not very physically motivated and some of the conclusions drawn are not very physical. that is you are given at the end of a discussion only an integral. It would have been nice if there were more discussions on the physics of Fourier Optics, for example pictures of actual experimental results or clear diagrams that show for example how does the diffraction pattern for a given input looks like. So getting an intuitive grasp of the subject at a pictorial level, where you can 'see' the results is a bit challenging to get out of this book. also very expensive."
5,Two great Russian minds meet,"A wonderful opportunity to catch on this encounter between one of Russia's most unique souls with one of its most interesting filmmakers, here in the role of the interviewer."
2,Great man trying to have a conversation with a mental midget,"Sokurov is the epitome of the elitist _Soviet_ style of ""bringing culture to the masses"" behavior of the Soviet cultural oligarchy. Unless you're prepared to endure his shallow attempts to contribute to creating an image of a great man who is Alexander Solzhenitsyn then don't bother -- you may find yourself throwing heavy things at the screen in total frustration. It will, however, illustrate the level of patience and grace by Solzhenitsyn having to go through this ordeal -- surely he went through a lot more in his life.Giving it some stars only because it features Solzhenitsyn. It's a pity a wiser person didn't get to make this documentary -- it could have so much more insight and value."
3,Is it just me?....,"...or were other readers put off by the self-congratulatory, faux-humble erotic obsessions of the narrator? Did anyone else have trouble imagining that this viewpoint was other than an extension of the author's fantasies...all the more icky since he's, like, 4 or 5 times the age of the frolicing tahitian playmates in the book. I don't think I'm a prude and enjoy the racy scene as much as the next reader, but I thought this was spookily voyeuristic, occasionally pedophiliac (is that a word?)This is one of several books I read before a trip to Tahiti and there were aspects I enjoyed. Bougainville's explorations seem to have been represented pretty faithfully, and gave me a wonderful historic foundation for our own trip. The details were striking enough to stay in my mind even through all the Mai-Tais - and I was certainly ready to forgive errors of first-novel-itis (clumsy backstory opening, occasionally heavy narrative etc.)But I never did manage to get rid of the ick factor."
3,Historical fiction?,"Maybe because I don't have a good background knowledge about 18th century France and Germany to build on, I didn't see much historical knowledge gained from reading this book. It was OK as a weekend book to read for pleasure. Perhaps because I agree with the idea that native peoples, in general, are better off left alone instead of ""converted"" to western ideas and customs, this book will not stay in my mind for long nor did it give me food for thought after I had finished reading it."
3,Really good.,I liked it alot. It was really interesting the way the main character kept going even when he was tired. I recommend this book highly.
1,Unrelievedly goofy,"If you are interested in the moist sexual fantasies of a ""well-known"" literary critic, filtered through his rather conventional political/historical imagination, and decorated with an assortment of Eastern bric-a-brac and thinly masked literary motifs, but practically no plot, read this book."
1,Wrong Charger--NOT compatible with SGH-T329,"I have a Samsung Stripe, SGH-T329. The charger they sent me definitely will not work with my phone. I don't know if this is because I received the wrong charger altogether, or whether this is just a case of mistaken advertising. In any case, I'm returning it and ordering this one: [...]. We'll see..."
5,perfect condtion,I got this charger for my old Samsung SPH-M610 and it works perfectly. Arrived on time and I was able to use my phone two hours later........it charges really fast.
3,ok,"Definitely a back up cord, not as long as the original one. It is easy to pop out of the connection. Not to happy with this one, but will work in a pinch as a back up for travel. Not a great replacement. Speedy service and arrived in good condition."
3,Looks OEM,"But unfortunately it turns out i have a Blackjack2, so this charger dosent fit.LAME. Oh well, its my fault."
1,No Luck with this one,"This charger drove my wife and I nuts. It never worked quite well with her Blackjack. The cord would be plugged in and it would completely stop charging at certain points and would disconnect with the phone (without even being touched). At night, the phone would be sitting on the dresser and randomly go into these beeping fits as it thought the charger was being plugged in and unplugged every other second. I wanted to give the charger the benefit of the doubt and blame it on the phone's sensitive connection. Unfortunately for this charger, I bought a new one from AT&T; and it worked like a charm. Not exactly a scientific study, but from my quick trial and error, it seems as if it was a faulty charger.Also, this happened the first night we had the charger and never got any better. So if you do purchase and don't have any of the mentioned issues, you'll probably be ok."
1,Sucks!,I packed this charger when my husband went on a business trip. It broke within a week. Sorely dissatisfied.
4,Fine Beginner's Text,"This book is fine for beginners. It is also fine for preparing for the MOUS exams. As I stated in my Excel 97 review, I cannot base my review of this book as a study guide for the Proficient Level exam because I took the Expert Level exam. The information in this book is a requirement for the exam. If you read my review on the Word 97 Advanced Step By Step book, don't overlook the basic tasks from this basic book. There is more than one way to accomplish a task such as printing and either one or more may be on the test."
5,THIS BOOK GOT MY TOTAL ATTENION,"Yes Frank is a suffering and miserably haunted individual, but I want to hear all about what he feels because he needs to tell his story. Has anyone ever really reached out and told him it would be alright? This author has me believing I am Frank's confidant, and I want to be there for him, afterall he's never really turned his back on anyone that needed help...................This bookgets ya and keeps ya. Great first effort by JoeConnelly. Can't wait to see who's telling his next story."
4,Bringing Out The Dead,"This is one of the best books I have read. It made great reading while waiting for the next ambulance call.Connelly is a genious, I have felt like Frank many times (Just wanting a quiet shift and four days off)and it is good to show the rest of the world that sometimes The Para-Gods have clay feet"
5,Catches the poetry of a good guy working NY's mean streets.,Brilliant first book. Whether Connelly will turn out to give us more first rate material or we find this was the book he had to write doesn't much matter. I wanted to read it before I see Scorcese's movie and I'm glad I did. The vivid passages describing the effects of emergency medicine on the stone cold body are entrancing. And I identify with the burnt out ambulance driver as the 'beyond disillusionment' metaphor of all the idealist American generations since WWII. As real and surreal as it gets --- don't miss this book.
2,Too depressing!,"I could not finish this book -- it was too dark and depressing for me. It never seemed to me to have a plot -- the next call was just like the last. Maybe a little too close to ""real life"" for me."
3,Gritty and Realistic But Missing Something Nonetheless,"I heard that they were making a movie of this starring Nicholas Cage. I think that's an ideal actor to play the lead role. I liked the book, however, maybe I was expecting too much, and wanted more. I wanted the character to be more demented then he was, I guess. I liked the book, however I wanted the characters to speak to me more than they did. I look forward to his next."
3,Dark novel that's not completely cohesive,"""Bringing Out the Dead"" is a story of a New York City medic who has been pushed to the breaking point of his psyche, due to exhaustion and feelings of guilt. While the story is well-written, it is difficult to keep up with the main character's thoughts, and follow what is happening. It's a dark novel, so if you are looking for something to make you laugh, stay far away from this book! If you want a story that will give you some insight into what it means to be a medic, then this is something you will want to read."
4,Thorough assessment of life on the streets in EMS.,"This book could easily be about any urban paramedic's experiences on the street. Many times I found myself thinking ""That was my patient once."" At times, however, it was true fiction, somewhat unbelievable to the trained eye. I did find the constant reference to a ""ghost"" redundant, but understand its relevance, especially in the context of the story. Overall, it is a well written book that depicts if not reality, at least what many of us have thought during those long nights on the street."
2,Dead on Arrival,Pray to God that neither Joe Connelly nor his characters show up as your EMT's if you have a heart attack.
1,Not What you Think,"This is the screenplay for the movie, not the novel. I had to return it and buy the book in a real bookstore."
2,Boring,"Boring, I saw the trailer and thought I was about battling monsters but I was dead wrong it's about money and using it now or the future blah blah blah. Super boring and preachy. Don't buy it on a wim like me watch some episodes first."
3,Great for a weekend getaway,"... But not so great for an eight-day cruise. I like the kit, but it's a little small. Great for a couple of days away, but not long vacations or extended business trips. And the little hanger thingy is useless. You can't hang it up and unzip the main compartment where you'd carry the bigger stuff--deodorant, body spray, body wash, etc.--it would all fall out. It's good for carrying the stuff, but once you get where you're going, you'll have to unload it all to hang up the kit, which kind of defeats the purpose. A nice looking design in theory, but in practice, it's a little weak."
