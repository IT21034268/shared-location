4,Musical for the Spirit world,"Man, No gospel and any other kind of missionary, white (Christian) religion here, but African , man. And what a religion! This is music is part of our animistic religion, bringing you in touch with the spirit world!"
2,more authentic is available,"try listening to a Zimbabwe musician play this instrument, you will hear the difference. Support Zimbabwe musicians by purchasing their music, there are plenty of genuine Zimbabwe CD's available."
4,Fun way to reinforce school skills,"This is another solid entry in the ClueFinders line. I've used these titles with 3 kids so far, and we all love them. They strike a great balance - making the kids practice the skills they're learning in school, but in a fun way that they look forward to.The format is really well thought-out. The mystery-adventure storyline draws the kids forward, the animation is good, and there are occasional extra ""flourishes"" (songs, jokes). The ancillary features (hints, auto-leveling) work well."
3,children's software,"This is a good software for the kids, but was not developed to sustain their excitement.After the first few days, my kids became bored with it especially after they solved the entire puzzle.My suggestion is that software such as these, should be written in a format to enable the kids start afresh at the end of the puzzle."
3,Very Average,"There isn't much to get excited about on this cd. All of the voices and music pretty much blend into each other and there is very little distinction between artists. It is not bad, just not very inspired. Switchblade Symphony is the best of the bunch but you would be better off buying one of their cd's. Marginally good ritual music. Save your pennies unless you can get it used."
1,May I Have A Refund?,"I've been a longtime fan of goth, but this disc is more amateur wannabe-goth-and-new age than anything else, with the exception of Lycia, who have always deserved more attention than any Projekt band to date in my opinion. Some tracks are tolerable, but some are just plain boring, like BTFABG's. Only BTFABG would have the ego to cover their own songs. Please, put it to bed, guys. Love ya, but you just don't cut it this time."
4,Excellent!,"As a second language teacher, I really like this software. You get to hear and practice real conversations you would come across in daily living."
3,Learn to speak Spanish,"I purchased this course & halfway through the CD started playing up,skipping parts & duplicating others.I returned the CD to TLC in Crawley in Sussex & haven't heard zilch.No answers to phone calls or e-mails.Now I have a manual,a program in my computer that requires a CD before it will open & no CD.My advice is STAY WELL CLEAR of The Learning Company & don't waste your money as I have done(or should it be as I have been DONE)Bill Gardner"
2,Disorganized!,The content is VERY disorganized and hard to use. I would recommend to buy other products.
4,"Yes, I got what I paid for","Because when I bought this software, I paid $74. Now most Spanish lessons on CD-ROMs avereage $30, so I don't put too much stock in the value of a package, rather what it does for me.The Learn To Speak Spanish is so far my favorite. While others provide cartoons of humans, I learn from looking at a moving human speaking directly to me. Using this software, I went to Malaga Spain and was able to communicate.I still need it to communicate in New York where I live. N. America is becoming an English/Spanish-speaking country and using this software in conjunction with others helps me to communicate daily in the U.S.A."
1,Garbage on a CD,"One of the poorest quality software products ever shipped. Did they test this before releasing it?The program routinely locks up, requiring you to restart your computer. Who knows what the program is like...you can't even get it to run long enough to find out.Useless...oh well, maybe I can use the CD for a small frisbee."
2,Learn to Speak Spanish 8.1,"Much to my dismay, I could not get this software to run on my system, Windows 98 SE. I tried a really clean install, but to no avail. I tried all the trouble shooting tips on the company's website, and they did not get it to run either. All I get is that nasty ""illegal operation"" message. So, I'm returning it."
1,Does NOT run on Windows XP,"I bought this from another source, and so was less informed at the time about what this program works with -- I can't evaluate it for quality, but you'll notice that Windows XP is not a listed operating system, and for good reason: installating and attempting to run this program so fouled up my XP computer I had to do a system restore."
4,Fun to learn,"This program is quite entertaining. I am starting spanish from scratch and I have enjoyed learning. There is a pretest so the program can judge your level and start you at the right place. Navigation is a bit confusing, but once you figure it out it isn't that difficult."
5,Sweeney Todd a musical Thriller!,"This Sweeney Todd Broadway Cast live from at the New York Philharmonic is excellent! I have the dvd of this at home. I'm a little upset that they replaced three people which are Johanna, Beggar Woman and Judge Turpin. I'm happy they kept George Hearn becuase he's my favorite Sweeney. We'll now I'm confuessed because I just saw this show in New York city with Michael Cerveris. Davis Gains as Anthony Hope is amazing. He played Phantom for sevral years. Patti Lupone is back as Mrs.Lovett in the new one. This is my favorite version of this show. It's amazing I love it."
3,There's one thing that this cast has got going for it....,"...and it is Neil Patrick Harris. What an amazing voice! Unfortunate that 'Not While I'm Around', which he sings superbly, is all-but-ruined by LuPone's awful English accent. Lupone is simply not able to express her character enough to make us as repulsed as we are by Angela Lovett's delightful portrayal; Lupone just doesn't fit in with the part. David Gaines sounds to mature--to old--to be a good Anthony. It reminds one of the 30-year olds who try and play Romeo in Romeo and Juliet; it just doesn't work. Definitely buy the original cast first, and if you believe that one spectacular tenor voice singing possibly the best Broadway ballad in history is enough to warrant buying a whole 2CD set, then do."
2,Too expensive for this abomination to Sweeney Todd,"I was more than excited to receive my copy of this, because I've always considered ""Sweeney Todd"" as one of my all-time favorites; but, this recording was such a disappointing drip! Patti LuPone, who I personally respect very highly, hits a blatant and unforgivable flat on ""Not While I'm Around"" captured on CD forever! Get the Angela Lansbury version instead -- she's a lot more beleivable and seasoned than what the ""Evita has-been"" attempts to do here. I'm surprised Steve let that one pass. Bernadette Peters should have been the person for this role, no doubt. I've listened to that awful flat over and over again, and it just helplessly stuns me. If you don't believe me, listen carefully to the second bridge to the refrain, and you'll stop listening to this particular recording forever. The New York Philharmonic, naturally, is just exceptional."
2,"Oh Patti. Patti, Patti, Patti. What did you do?","Patti Lupone being one of my all-time favorite singers and Sweeney Todd being one of my all-time favorite musicals, I thought this CD would be a sure thing. Sadly, it isn't so. There are a few things that bother me about this recording, but none more than Ms. Lupone's take on Mrs. Lovett. Ms. Lupone is a great singer but, man, she was just all over the place in this concert. I don't know what happened but it sounds like she spent the entire evening trying to find the character and just never got there. I was sorely disappointed. In a perfect world, I could take George Hearn off this recording and put it on a disc with Angela Lansbury from the original Broadway recording. Patti Lupone is a wonderful performer, but you wouldn't know it if this was the only time you heard her sing."
5,Wonderful Life Lessons!,"What Kids Need to Succeed is a must-read for today's parents. We so often focus on giving kids ""stuff"" instead of the life lessons that which will see them through for a lifetime. This book, in a wonderful, easy-to-read style, is full of those life lessons.It's clear that both Andrea and Harry have a great deal of wisdom to share. When I read this book, I said to Andrea, ""It's a great book, and I want to meet your father.""It's my new favorite gift for friends with children."
5,I wish I'd had this book 30 years ago!,"As a parent and an educator, I am very impressed by ""What Kids Need to Succeed."" This excellent book uses a strength-based model for parenting skills. I wish I'd had this book when I was raising my children, and will be giving it to my sons when they become parents. Andrea has hit the nail on the head.Jackie Griswold, Ed.D."
5,I wish my parents had read this book!,"A need to read for any parent or anyone wanting to better understand what self achievement is all about. What Kids Need to Succeed is a quick, easy read. I was involved from the first page. The authors have the ablility to share their own life experiences with clarity and humor. I gave my first copy to my son's middle school principal!"
4,Beautiful,This is a very beautiful deck. The only reason why I didn't rate it more as I would like to see a larger book with more information available on each card.
3,"Seems Okay, Rings could be better","I bought this recently to keep a Spanish workbook in good shape. I think the rings are a bit flimsy. However, the notebook seems to be good and should last a while. If there are any problems, I'll add an update."
4,Solo,"Si el propósito de esta grabación, era la de darle un sonido antiguo, propio del instrumento que usa el ejecutante, y que tuviera una atmósfera de salón de estudio, en la que el instrumentista se encuentra solo con su ejecución, pues creo que lo lograron (productor, ingeniero, instrumentista); ya que se siente una música con sabor a meditación, con los sonidos y ecos propios de una habitación con un mínimo de arropamiento. Muy buena interpretación, llena de reflexión y de intimidad, que el ejecutante nos hace sentir en cada fraseo de acorde y en la dinámica de cada nota."
1,ANOTHER DISASTROUS COPY CAT,"Here we go again. Yet another pianist recording the piano music of Lecuona. Forget that its for EMI: Of all the available recordings: this is without question, the WORST. No technical prowess here, little color variation, no understanding of styles (does she know what a danza Cubana or malaguena is..or a Vals Brillante-weh!). The tempi are so slow, so unstylistic, so contrived, there is no Latino essence at all in this music. It sounds like quite over pompous salon music. The pianist is terrible. And the sound quality of the disc sounds like she was recorded under the English Channel!As a Cuban, I find the minimization of our great national treasure, Lecuona...offensive in this collection. Go out and by the real thing: the Tirino BIS Lecuona series and get Lecuona's own recording as compliment-go experience what is Cuba!"
3,Not quite what I expected,"Although thoroughly pleasing, this music only intermittently sounds Latin. And quite unlike Gershwin to be sure. I was reminded rather of Granados in the best moments (and of Scott Joplin is the less inspired ones...)"
2,"This is a study guide, NOT the complete textbook","After downloading it to my kindle I realized that this is NOT the actual textbook, it's a study guide for the textbook. I didn't see the small print on the upper right hand corner of the image and I didn't think that the rest of the product page made it clear by any means either. I think it needs to be more clear; I probably wouldn't have purchased the study guide, now I have no choice :("
2,Disappointing Textbook,"I recently used this book for my Molecular Biology course. The instructors chose to update the textbook for the course to this one in hopes of using a book that described the current techniques and advances in the field. We should have never switched books. The book is well-organized, but the depth in which material is covered fails to impress. It was fine for the purpose of describing the mechanisms of transcription/translation and replication, but was lacking in the protein structure/function department. Descriptions of specific operons and regulatory mechanisms were somewhat unclear. I was especially disappointed in the methods section for analyzing gene expression as well as the protein analysis section. Sure you can get the ""gist"" of molecular biology with this book, but don't expect yourself to be able to go into the lab or read scientific papers in the field without confusion. Needless to say, our professor is switching to a different textbook for next year."
2,kindle edition vs paperback,"I don't know whether I am just not sure how to work with the kindle edition, but it does not seem to be the same book as the paperback.This is basically just concepts and questions. It seems like I wasted my money - can somebody please help me?"
4,Great Reading for the Civil War Buff,"Maury Klein has really captured the mindset of America during the pre Civil war years. From the political in-fighting, to Major Anderson trying to avert hostilities while maintaining his honor, to the women of Charleston standing on their balconies watching Fot Sumter get pummelled with a barrage of artillary. A must read for any Civil War Historian. Kutos to Maury Klein."
5,Now I Get It,"""Getting them to give a Damn"" by Eric Chester is an eye-opening, easy read about the generation in the work force - and those following closely behind. This instant gratification, tell me ""why"", and I'm doing it my way, employee is changing the way work gets done.This book gives some insight into communication skills, win-win work examples and how to say it so they'll understand.Must have for any parent, high school teacher or employee of this age group!"
2,"good on the outside, but on the inside...","so i was looking @ the outside of the binder when it arrived and was pretty impressed with how it looked, till i opened it. The sleeves on the inside are a tacky clear plastic full of grooves and warps. The rings are nice, but look like they will break down relatively easy. save your money for something better. if you like tacky ugly as ____ sleeves and sub par rings though, go for it! the only redeeming point was the price, but i have changed my mind on that."
2,Fluff,If you are a royal fan and know anything about Bertie and Elizabeth then do not buy this. It is pure fluff. It makes the King look incompetent and stupid. Very disappointing
3,An understated portrait of King George VI and his Queen,"A fine understated portrayal of King George VI and the wonderful support he received from his wife, Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother. It enables viewers to understand the difficulties this shy nervous man, supported by his wife, overcame and more fully appreciate the wonderful contribution he made to Britain and the free world during WWII."
5,History unfolded,"Bertie and Elizabeth is a beautifully unfolding look back in a historical moment that captured the interest of the entire world - and all just before the outbreak of World War II. The acting is superb, historically, it is absolutely accurate, all characters were wonderfully well acted, direction, costuming, set designs, all were outstanding. For those few of us still living remember well the romance of Edward VIII and Wallis Simson, and the speech(es) of George VI. We were not aware of his impediments, thanks to the manner in which the media managed to keep them hidden in a way - much like they did for F.D.R., never showing him in a wheel chair. The vendor was accurate and prompt in all ways! For the younger people, this is a marvelous tool for learning the past. For us very senior persons, it is a beautifully produced and acted stroll down memory lane."
5,Bertie and Elizabeth,"Purchased this DVD after watching The King's speech and wanted to know more of his story. I thoroughly enjoyed this version. Yes, it is not the King's speech, but I LOVE Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), so anything he is in will be the best for me."
3,It's OK,"The movie is not very dramatic, but more like documentary. One can learn some history from it. But I was hoping for more details that was not there. I agree with another reviewer that it should be a miniseries."
4,"Good, but too short","I enjoyed this movie very much. The characters were well drawn, and it gave a good overview of the marriage of George VI and his consort Elizabeth, later the queen mother. However, the movie was too short to really do justice to all the material. We were moved suddenly from the christening of the future Queen to the introduction of Mrs. Simpson with little notice of the intervening years. The build up to the war was rushed through, lost in the king's anguish over the division between him and his brother. And we see far too little of the princesses as they grow - Elizabeth jumps from 10 to 19 with barely a mention in between. This movie should have been a complete miniseries!"
4,Project Runway Season 10,Have every season from this series and can't wait for next one. Seems to be getting more variation in designers where you are pretty sure who will be voted off pretty quickly.
3,Coming apart at the seams,"Conventional wisdom among many fans of Project Runway is that the show has declined, in just about every way, since its move to Lifetime. Blame the producers, blame the participants, or blame the simple fact that after ten seasons the formula is growing stale. Unfortunately, Season 10 confirms this decline. I'm no longer sure what the focus of this show is. The creative process is given short shrift in nearly every episode, and while that used to be excusable if a contestant had a compelling personal narrative, this season feels spectacularly void of real drama, insight, or thrills. I'm bored! Bored of the same ""twists"", the same types of challenges season after season and the same faux camaraderie. When Nina Garcia is the one wearing the most interesting and innovative clothing (she kills in Marni), you know it's time to mix things up or exit gracefully. I gave it an extra star for Tim Gunn, who is cashing his check weekly but clearly knows the gig is getting stale."
4,judges say they want innovation and then don't select it,"i am very disappointed in who won this show. this person came in last for me. the one who should have won, the one who truly was an innovator, came in second. on the plus side though, i did enjoy all four shows, i thought all four showed complete collections with impeccable workmanship. the judges are good at selecting the finalists every season but never seem to really pick the daring innovator who they claim they want. but you will enjoy the shows so i give it four stars. although they have a formula which works after ten seasons, i wish they would do something a bit different for season eleven, i am getting a bit bored. i also am getting tired of so many black clothes. i think i enjoy the all stars version better because it is more daring."
4,Season 10,This was a good season for project runway...so of the challenges were different and they weeded out the negative people.
5,One of Important Ageless Schubert Recordings,"The tonal quality of this famous orchestra led by Beecham are historically preserved in this fine recording.Especially enjoy the oboe/bassoon duet in the 3rd's Minuet!This fine Schubert is able to bring out the ethos and joy in its composition, and the lyrical movement in the 5th. Enjoy listening to it often."
1,Questionable company,Family Tree Legends made by Pearl Street Soltware is sending out e-mails offering their basic program for $14.95. When you fill out the form their thank you for ordering page has a price of $69.95. Repeated attempts to contact the company have been ignored. Would not trust this company
3,Whats the difference in regular or deluxe?,What is the difference in regular or deluxe? I bought the deluxe and only got one cd and an owners manual. Please tell me!!!
2,Gets caught a lot,"I bought this for my son because of the great reviews. We started out playing expecting the best. But, it can be challenging to get the ball to go through some of the connectors. Also, you can't really build it up that great, there isn't a ton of pieces. My son played with it about a half hour, and didn't ever want to play with it again. I feel like it was a waste."
5,Loving this toy,Everything fit well.. Great quality. Overall easy to create fun flows after about five minutes of toying with it. Even three yr old had fun with it. Required some adult help for maximum enjoyment.
3,"Good but not great, wish i'd known..",I really like that this is made of wood but I wish I had known it does not work with regular sized marbles- my son had couldn't use his favorite marbles. Just ok for building.
5,"It's not pink like the picture shows, but my daughter still loves it!","Like I said in the title, the produce image implies that the blocks are different shades of pink, which was a bonus since that is my daughter's favorite color. When the toy arrived, they are just the standard 'wood' color. That aside, my daughter loves the toy and it can provide simple fun to complex puzzle-solving thought. It comes with a storage bag, which is definitely a plus. I have recommended this toy to several friends. My daughter is 5, and like I have said before, she loves it!"
5,Blocks & Marbles Super Set,"Excellent toy! Lots of ways to use creativity and problem solving skills while having fun! Durable, lasting, educational toy. Our 7 year old loves it!Blocks & Marbles Super Set"
4,Good Product,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. Heloves to take it out and play with it. It isso much more durable then the plastic one hereceived a few years earlier. The only thing thatwould make it perfect, is if the blocksactually connected. Sometimes my son gets a littlefrustrated with that. But overall I would buy again."
5,excellent toy,it is an excellent educative toy and it arrived on time even I am in mexico. Also it has an excellent quality
2,Only useful for brand new teachers,"This is not like the Interchange teacher's editions, which give answers for all of the exercises, etc. It basically walks you through the lessons step by step, reminding you to have the students open their books, etc. I imagine that if you are not normally a teacher and have signed up to teach ESL, it might be useful, but if you are a teacher of any experience at all, it's just not useful. I do, however, highly recommend the Interchange and Passages series overall for ESL instruction. Just don't bother buying the Passages teacher's manuals."
5,RARE,I bought this set for The Shaving Cream alone i could care less about the splash on lotion. I have to thank BeautyEncounter for selling this product i havent had a can of Brut Shaving Cream since i was 16 or 17. I would like to be able to buy a bunch of these cans somehow but i have no idea where. I also have no idea what year this set is from if anyone knows please add a comment. Thanks
2,"Beautiful, But Can't See the Time","This elegant, slender watch is a beautiful piece of jewelry, but in most light the reflection on the face of the watch makes it impossible to tell what time it is. I love the light weight and beautiful appearance, but I also want to be able to tell what time it is, after all. I would buy another Skagen, but would buy one with a white face."
2,Hand on face fell off!,"I purchased this watch in May 2008. Initially, I was pleased with it until I tried to look at the time the other day and found that the large hand on the watch had loosen and fallen inside the glass case. I only wore it occasionally and never abused or mishandled the watch to cause the hand to fall off. Because it only has a one yr manufacturer's warranty, I am trying to see if the company can cover the cost, but I still have to pay $8.95 to send it. Not sure if it's worth mailing or going to a jeweler for the repair. In any event, I don't plan to ever purchase a Skagen watch again after this experience. The quality isn't what I thought it was."
1,Please,"For health and safety reasons, and mental, stay clear from this album. Unless you want a really easy way to break your windows in your house. oh and to dance to funky midi music"
4,A Trip from Afghanistan,"Lalla is rescued from a horrible Afghan life by Kassim, a surly and taciturn man who turns out to be an English spy. But, when she returns to England, she finds someone else has taken over her life. She eventually makes her way throughout England with Lord Henry, an eccentric man who takes her in."
4,A good story but...,"I have owned this book for many years and recently reread it. (I've been doing that a lot lately with books sitting on my shelf trying to remember why I had saved them and to see if I still want to keep them.)This is a good story ... a little hard to believe all the coincidences later in the book to bring it to its end, but still an engaging read. The language is a bit stilted but as you read you get used to it and the word phrasing seems to reflect the way a person of that era might write and speak.The book is set in Afghanistan and England during the late 1800s. I enjoy history and found the use of actual historical events and cultural elements from that time period to be well done and very interesting. I recently read that this book is a historical romance written by Peter O'Donnell under the pen name of Madeleine Brent. It is certainly not the typical torrid romance novel and I would not compare it to, or even call it, a romance novel of the type they put out today."
1,Does not work on XP,"Many older software written for Windows 95/98 will work on Windows XP. This game will not, even after running the Compatability Wizard. I emailed Riverdeep.com, the support company for this game and they confirmed that it will not work."
5,Educational and Entertaining,"This game is fantastic. My kids used to love educational games when they were younger, but went through a stage of disinterest. I think it was because they weren't challenged by the material or the graphics were too young. This game changed everything. They love it, and so do all of their friends. The graphics are cool. The competition is fun. The characters are realistic. The theme is very popular right now--spying and secret agent stuff. It is perfect for my eight year old, but my 6 year old son and 10 year old neice both enjoy playing it as well."
2,repeat of same thing,"i was very disappointed with the great chase and think quick ,the geeat chase is a repeat of where in time is carmen sandiego"
4,Happenin' Book,"This book is really swell. I loved the flying hair monsters that hid in the trees. Those guys that looked like four armed Andy Griffiths were a little creepy, though. The drug addict monkeys were a little inapropriate for toddlers."
5,How to translate programming techniques into effective games,"Modern game player expect high-tech cinematography in their games, which demands game programmers understand the basics of lighting, camera positioning, and more. If it's a brush-up on the basics and insights into how programmer translates into high-quality real-time gaming which is needed, then Brian Hawkins' Real-time Cinematography For Games is your ticket. Hawkins is well versed in using scripted character animation and game development routines: his expertise translates to technical discussions which explain how to translate programming techniques into effective games. Programmers who have basic programming and graphics concepts down already will find Real-Time Cinematography takes the next step."
3,barney:oh brother she's my sister,"LOVE THE PRODUCT, IF I NEED ANOTHER ONE, AMAZON.COM IS WHERE I'M GOING TO GET IT."
3,for very narrow feet,"These shoes are really cute but only if you have narrow feet. Rockport shoes tend to be very narrow and it's hard to tell from the website pictures and descriptions, if you have slightly wider feet I would recommend getting the wide sizes if available."
3,Learn to Spreak French 8.1,"Good to have this product. I have different resources for learning French. It's good for me to use it with other resources. I wish I would have a workbook with it, which is essential for learners. Regardless, I like it."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR Windows XP,"I bought this product for my Windows XP computer. It doesn't work. Even their own web site says:Product: Learn to Speak French 8.1Issue: No Valid Data Base, Error Code 58Description: When attempting to launch Learn to Speak(tm) French 8.1, a message similar to ""No valid data base. Error code: 58"" appears.Solution: This is a Private Issue. DO NOT Email. This issue is currently being researched. As of now it seems this is only occurring on Windows(r) XP. Gather system information, the exact error message and any details and forward the information to your supervisor.[URL]I don't see why a bug that makes a product useless is a ""PRIVATE ISSUE"". Especially for a product labelled ""Designed for XP"" in big letters on the box. I will report back IF this bug is fixed."
1,Worse than worthless,"Worse than worthless. NO phonetic pronunciation hints! NO introductory slow pronunciations. How are we expected to learn French when starting with Lesson 1 on page 1, the instruction book does not follow the CD? Half of this program consists almost entirely of hundreds of random phases to remember. And these phrases are not the phrases a tourist would ask but rather the phrases a Frenchman would give in response to a question a tourist might ask. We are taught ""Tu veux boire quelque chose?"" (Would you like something to drink?), but we are not taught the phrase for ""I would like something to drink."".. .Where are we supposed to learn how to ask common questions? The remaining half of the book appears to be randomly slapped together grammar quizzes, e.g., what are sixteen Past Participles of Regular Verbs?Learn French? Not with this program."
1,FRUSTRATING,"This program was extremely frustrating to use. I found the voice recognition cool until I realized that if I said something that sounded even similar to the word I was supposed to be speaking. it would be ""recognized"". The online portion of the program where you are supposed to be able to set up study programs, etc., wouldn't work. The website would only load intermittently. This program does not save your work, so after spending 45 minutes going through a lesson and accidentally hitting the ""back"" key, it was as though I had never done the lesson. I couldn't get back to where I was. I was very unimpressed with this software. There is also no real ""guide"" to speak of. No handbook on the software, just an outline in the program that doesn't really answer questions. I spent several hours trying to figure this thing out and got nowhere, and I spend my day working on computers. Definitely not recommended!"
1,poor rating,"Virtually worthless. NO phonetic pronunciation hints! NO introductory slow pronunciations.

1,Beware! It might be great but doesn't work on a mac.,I bought this to use on my mac computer but it will not work on it. It was listed here to be used on either mac or windows but on the box it says only for windows and will not install. No help on their web sight and no help from the seller.
2,boring,I'm fourteen years old and on my second year of french. This program isn't so great. 1. all of the learning is through speaking and repeating words. 2. there aren't any games that make it fun to learn. 3. it's kind of confusing. I wouldn't recommend it to kids at all. It might be okay if you only learn through speaking. It would be better if it had more options.
3,Better than some ...,"As an MT I'm constantly on the lookout for interesting, relaxing music. While there are some good music on this 3-CD set, there is usually something off about a particular track, like a monotonous chime throughout a song that begins to grate on your nerves after 5 minutes, or the style of music is too repetitive track after track which, again, begins to grate.However, to pick and choose some music to mix and match with other CD's, I think I can make use of this package. Just not as much as I'd hoped."
2,Not Much There,"This book offers some great theoretical support, however, it is often preachy and shows the counselor, in my opinion, as ridgid and stale."
3,Mom In NY,You get what you pay for here. The end clamp brok off when I was trying to put a charm in it. Since I broke it I didnt contact the seller.
4,"18"" black rubber cord chain necklace","Rubber necklace came quickly. Looks great, and will be able to use it with many pendants."
4,"Good prices, friendly people but slow delivery","Finally got it yesterday (JAN 09) and it was ordered as a Xmas present on NOV 26. The person that answered my emails was very friendly and had a fast reply BUT this same thing happened last year when ordering the same product. I'm sure they are a good company but they, like many others, STILL don't know how to handle orders from Puerto Rico addresses. Still I would give them a third and last chance if I need any of their produtcts."
1,rip off!!!,"What a piece of garbage! I used this for online college, and it is falling apart, after only 3 months of use. It never even left the house! I can just imagine if I bought it for one of the kids! Oh, I miss those denim binders!"
1,Switchview MM1 2 port PS/2 USB KVM Switch,Didn't work trying to switch between a Mac mini and a desktop PC. Kept getting stuck in PC mode.
2,dvd,not what i expected it to be. good quality film. my mistake. i will be much more careful reading descriptions in the future
4,down to earth trucking,Discusses alot of the problems facing truckers today. Love the music and scenery.Would like to see an updated volume 2.
2,Let down,"As an employee for a Landstar dispatching agency, I have come to love drivers. I was looking for a video that would help me see the ins and outs of their side of the equation. This film had very little of that. If I didn't know so many drivers personally, this video would have left me with the impression that one has to have a messed up past, a severe dissatisfaction with the government, or a willingness to sleep with hookers to be a driver. As a flag-waving american who doesn't consider his past to be a total mess, this movie left me with the impression that truck driving is just not for me. The attempt was obviously to gain sympathy for drivers, to put a human side on a society that is sort of labeled as a commodity rather than people. If I didn't know better, I'd walk away thinking all drivers hate the government and have been divorced multiple times. Definitely did not like this approach."
3,reality check,"It should have been stressed more that the trucking industry does not receive the respect it deserves from the general public. More and more city ordinances are going after the trucks for all of their air pollution problems, 4 wheelers don't want to share the road, filthy truckstop bathrooms/restaurants and let's be real here, please, when was the last time you saw a beautiful&friendly clerk greeting you when you come thru those truckstop doors? Smile America...they're working for YOU!!!"
4,"Well, not ""Perfect""...","Like the other reviewer, I feel it's difficult to label this CD ""The Perfect Mozart"" without including the 25 Symphony. However, that shows how pointless it is to label ANY CD ""The Perfect Mozart"" - especially just a single CD. Most of my favorite Mozart isn't on here. It just goes to show how silly it is to think of a Mozart ""greatest hits"" album.However, what is important is how the pieces on the album are played and I must say that they are all played well. Much of it is conducted by Neville Mariner, who did the music for the movie Amadeus. I am listening to the CD now and for some reason - possibly because of the irreverent nature of the album - on the computer all the performers are labeled ""some dumb orchestra"".All in all, this is not the ""only"" Mozart album you will ever need, but it is a good random sampling of some of Wolfgang's catchier tunes."
3,Entertaining or Informative: Can't Make up it's Mind,"I wish I had researched this book a little more before I bought it. I was a bit disappointed, since I was expecting an entertaining ""little book"". I have the added misfortune to have studied some Feng Shui, so very little of it was news to me. But it also failed to entertain. Often several pages and illustrations were used when one would have done as well. It failed to capture the light hearted attitude of pooh, and of Feng Shui, and lapsed in pedantic statements instead. I would only recommend it to someone who knows nothing about Feng Shui and likes the format to make the subject more accessible."
2,Not that great,This book isn't really a story book like I was hoping for. Its pretty much a scrap book. Mostly pictures and not a lot of material to read. I'm a fan of both Blair Witch movies and there is a pretty cool section that breaks down all main charactors. Only worth it if you are a big Blair witch fan.
3,"Not enough info, but enjoyable.","Not a novelization but more like a scrapbook of articles, emails, etc. regarding the characters in BW2, it does offer some insight on the muddled plot of the movie and the characters, but the problem is that it's not nearly enough! Many questions are still to be resolved regarding the Blair Witch herself and her powers. And nothing is said about the Wiccan girl character that in the movie ""communes"" with the Blair Witch. The best part of the book is the inclusion of an alleged pulp magazine story which mentions the Book of Shadows (which was nowhere to be seen in the movie by the way). In short, interesting but lacking somewhat."
5,one of the best cds ive heard in awhile,"im not just saying this is one of the best cd's ive heard in awhile because im a hardcore fanboy and/or because i know the lead singer's mom or any other stupid biased reason like that. i listen to a lot of music and this has been one of my most satisfying purchases in the last year easily. i judge an album's quality by how many tracks i skip, and i only skip three on average (oregon girl and the last two). that's a pretty fantastic album in my mind.the tracks are emotional but not in a whiny-emo way. i liken them to having more of a rainy sunday feel.this album is a real unique treasure in my opinion."
4,"Good band, bad production (3.5 Stars)","I was very much anticipating this album before I received it. The samples sounded good and the reviews were good also. When I received it I discovered a couple of things. First, the band is very good. A cross between the Shins, Weezer, and a few other influences you will probably recognize. But the production was muffled making everything sound very neutral- you can never tell this kinda stuff from the samples. Maybe this is what they were striving for, but it hurts the effort they have put into crafting fine songs. In the end I would recommend this album because they are clearly a good band with huge potential to create fun and original music. But this album could have been better and I hope that next time around the band sounds bigger than a basement recording."
5,Great Album. Hear more about it in a podcast interview w/ the band's lead singer.,Hey SSLYBY fans!There's a free podcast interview available at the thoughtworthy.com website with Philip Dickey (singer/song writer). It's a good listen for those fans who want to learn about the band's reaction to their appearance on The OC.You can find the interview at:http://www.thoughtworthy.com/contact.cgim?partner=TWM&tab;=PODCAST&contact;_id=12530&tab;_id=0#navbar
3,Undercover Sex Signals,"I'm just beginning to read this book but, so far it's pretty interesting. However, the book titled ""What Every Body is Saying"" , which I'm also reading right now, has proven to be more useful to me when it comes to reading people's body language."
1,the worst seduction book ever,"If you are a guy dont buy this book.It is about how women (that they have also find you attractive+have courage+want to play) respond by giving signals in order for you to goa and approach them.Nothing else. Its a complete waste of money -> read other seduction books likeHow to Become an Alpha Male: Attract Women and Become Successful at Seduction+How to Succeed with Women, Revised and Updated+How to Be the Bad Boy Women Love+ of course the god MYSTERYThe Pickup Artist: The New and Improved Art of Seduction"
3,A little too long.,"Long winded writing, or it could be condensed by 40%, and still get the points across. I guess these writers get paid by the amount of pages written. Just buy it used. Nothing-exceptional here."
4,A single man's best friend,"I read another one of Lowndes' other books before reading this one (How to Talk To Anyone) and I can say that if you look for the signals here you greatly increase your chances of finding women that are interested in you. One thing I will note in a lot of seduction/ dating related books out there this one talks A LOT about how the book will help you in the earlier chapters. It may not be an issue for a patient person, but I like for these kinds of books to cut to the chase a bit more. Obviously if I didn't think the book was going to help me, I wouldn't have bought it. However all that aside this is a great book for men looking for a woman interested in them. There are a plethora of nuggets of wisdom that explain the inner workings of a woman's mind,what they look for, and most effectively it tells with what kind of women you'll be most efficient with. Reader beware; some of the points are sympathetic to women ever so slightly."
5,Written by a Woman,"This was an good book that could have been done in half the pages. I enjoyed it though because it gives insight into some ""signals"" that we men do not even comprehend as a ""signal."" There are the obvious ones we all get, but there are more available to those who are willing to learn. Since it was written by a woman, she is able to give valuable insight in how to interpret a woman's body language, and how to coearse her with the correct responses."
1,Cosmo Style of Writing - very basic info,"This was a painful read. The writer writes as though she's writing for Cosmo magazine, almost patronizing style of writing in a joking manner. At least I find very annoying. Very basic signals anyone should already know - no secret to me at least? I don't understand anyone being happy with buying and reading this book. Have to wonder who it is really writing all these positive reviews. I found other books such as The Lay Guide, Stumbling Naked in the Dark and The System so much better I can't even compare them against this book that is headed for the trash since it's too late to return. Would give it 1/10 of a star if I could."
4,How they really think,"Worth it even if only for 1 thought.""I'm not looking at who I pick, it's who picks me.""Everything else was good, if somewhat repetitive.The pictures show some points better than pages of descriptive text."
1,Worst pick-up book,"This is the worst pick -up book i've read so far, Guys, never ever buy books on pick-up that are written for guys by female authors, liel lowndes is looking at dating and pick -up from a females perspective.The advice on this book just does not work,The only thing it will do fopr you is turn you into a weak Beta male. If you're a guy get yourself books like The Lay Guide, How to Become an Alpha Male, Mystery Method, The Art of Mackin, The Mack Within and The Game.I highly recommend these books."
2,surface signals and downright damaging to men,"Really this book should have been 30 to 40 pages tops. The insightfullness in this book comes from the body language/signals. There are slight details of female thoughts on dating and what they want in their men to be like(all visual perception). If that is what you are looking for then you may be fulfilled by this book on that part. I am giving this book this score because I have to rate it against the genre of material as a whole. Thus 2 stars out of a material of content and context of 5 stars.Don't read this book for anything else. There are no conversational tools. There are no true insights to the female mind, like what she says and what she really means/wants. If someone could write a book with all of the above, a sort of bible guide to women, they would strike gold. But that is not this book. And don't anyone dare say Grey's name."
1,Complete Rubbish,"Do yourself a favour and don't buy the book - you are better off going to a bar and talking to a few ladies. I am sure they will give you much better advice, and you will have much more fun. You will save yourself the price of the book, and save yourself the time of reading it and hearing a thousand times that Ms Lowndes is going to hand you the keys to the magic kingdom. There are no such keys..."
2,BOOOO she talks to much,"This is playing the game by the girls rules, SHE's basically saying girls like to play little flirty games that are cute and fun, this is how to play. SCREW THAT, what gets a woman turned on is that your the man making the rules. Making the moves. Sure you cant be a complete caveman (although its been known to work) but this book is a joke. Some of the advice is not bad but its can all be boiled down to about 20 pgs, the rest is filler of jokes and wit and humor that she thinks makes her fun, wich is kinda true but not for people who are looking for some answers, her style of writing is best for an advice column in a newspaper."
5,You won't regret reading this book.,"When I was out on saturday nigths things happened around me that I did not understand, at least it was very foggy until I read this book. This book will give you a lot, much more that the usual ""how to lay a woman"" theme books. This is real and I have tried it, it works and it is fun. Skip the ""more confidence books"", learn to read the symbolic signals and be the bait on the hook. Learn it, practise it and have fun when doing it."
4,"uncovered, another look from the other side of the table...","This is a good fun book, though i thought the Dentist story mid way through was a bit of a yawn: Dopey looking Dentist goes anywhere and pulls woman faster than he can pull teeth, he comes across as being full of it...Hmm story doesn't really work, probably because it came straight from author's head. All the same the book is worth a read. It does open your mind and shows how important it is to notice what the other side are offering in way of gesturing, even though most have read body language books, this offering is more aligned to us and them. It is nothing more than another view from across the table, you may not end up as trumped up as the Dentist but all the same the info will build confidence, i think so. Graeme Pont australia."
5,The Leil Deal!,Leil Lowndes has written another effective book on human interaction. Here's the thing-if you're going to fly a plane you don't just go fly one...you need to build some skill. Men with difficulty in reading women need this book! I discovered Leil through the Interviews with Dating Gurus CD series and sought more information.
5,Guys that question if a girl is into you get this book,"I bought this book because I like Lowndes' books I own ""Say Goodbye to Shy"" and ""How to Talk to Anyone"" and they both have helpfulf hints and activities on their topics. I bought this book because I have always been so dense when it comes to figuring out if a girl was into me. So many times other people had to tell me that a girl liked me because I couldnt see the subtle signals. When I saw the title and read some reviews I knew this book was for me. While reading this book I decided to look for signals wherever I go and actually started noticing the subtleties of female flirting. This book points out female flirting techniques and how to respond to them. My favorite pointer in the book was, dont go after the hot girl you notice but scan the room and see which women are into you and out of those women which do you like and go get her. Ever single guy should have this book."
5,just like the old pyle drivers,this is definately the best bang for the buck.i hade pyle drivers back in the 80's in my caddy with eqt's 31 band equalizers.with the 6x9's and the 8in sub this is the best you can get without adding at least 300 more bucks.and in a marine enviromet i can't see the justifacation
3,Boat stereo,It got to the house fast. The boat shop is installing it right now. Seems like a good deal will leave a feedback when I know more.
3,Anima - 'Sturmischer Himmel' (Spalax),"Interesting 1971 album CD reissue. Not sure as to how many releases this experimental duo, of Limpe and Paul Fuchs had put out. If you're a fan of the early '70's underground German pop music scene, then you might want to check this title out. Probably too way-out there for most.Strange, trippy cover, no? Enter at your own risk."
2,Oops!,The product is great - works like a charm...but OOPS! It doesn't come with cables! No wonder it was such a great deal. You are better off finding one that comes with all the appropriate cables unless you have them already.
5,excellene,"delivers amazing results, and lasts twice as long as any other wax. Ive been waxing 4-5 times per year. I used to be a 3m but now I have used Blitz paste wax . Blitz wax delivers depth, clarity, and shine bether than meguiars, and mother california gold Class and lasts long. and is easy to remove."
1,dont waste your money,THIS IS A VERY CHEAPLY MADE BRITISH FLICK THE ACTING WAS HORRIBLE . WHOM EVER WROTE THE MOVIE SCRIPT MUST HAVE BEEN A KID IN 2ND GRADE .
3,Inspiring Material But Not A Lot of How To's,"Larsen packs this book with quotables, illustrations, and assessments of well-known or respected authorities. Although he drops a lot of names and offers numerous ""golden nuggets,"" the book is not a practical ""how to"" work, nor is it concise and to the point.Larsen inspires and offers a lot of ""jabs,"" scoldings, and creative contrasts, but if I had not learned how to do narrative exposition elsewhere, I would not have learned it here. He would have left me with a lot of information but no clear procedure--or, if there is a clear procedure, it is buried within quotations, excerpts, and witicisms.If you want to read this book for enjoyment and inspiration, (or pithy sayings), you will not be disappointed. His theological positions are wonderful. But if you want concrete and to the point procedures, you may be let down."
3,Stanley 55-099 FatMax Xtreme Fubar Functional Utility Bar,Not as good of a tool as I thought it should be for the money.
1,Horrific design flaw,"As others have pointed out, the prybar portion of this tool is curved to the left, leaving any right-handed person injuring themselves whenever they pull the tool down toward their thigh. It will even take a chunk out of you if you're just not paying attention and lowering it to your side. This is unacceptable. DO NOT BUY THIS. Another problem is that the backside drywall blade is very dull, making it inefficient when seeking to split and rip wallboard. Although it's otherwise a well-made and balanced tool, those two design flaws prevent it from being useful for more than single-use jobs. A much better choice is to go with theDead On 18-Inch Annihilator Bar. It comes with a brilliant spike that allows you to punch through a wall quickly and accurately to see where the wiring is. The Dead On bar looks weird, but after a day of use, you'll thank me for finding a better tool."
2,Indestructible but unhandy to use,"Well flinshed while impressively heavy and rugged.Regarding demolition, its short length does not allow sufficient leverage take advantage of its brawn.Regarding self defense, its considerable weight and short length do not go well together. It is simply too heavy to maneuver quickly.A standard crow bar would serve much better for both applications, and cost much less."
2,Fundamental Ergonomic Flaws,"This is a tool I'd like to have, but refuse to buy. It's a very good persuader. It has a ton of demolition applications. We sell a lot of them at the lumber yard/hardware store I work at.It has one huge, fundamental flaw, which I can't say I'm surprised by, considering that Stanley is pretty much a Chinese name anymore. The flaw is that this hammer was made for lefties when the construction industry is dominated by righties. How do I know this? Look at the curve in the pry bar. The teeth scrape against the inside of your right arm when you hammer with it. Sure, you could have your wrist bent so the teeth fit into your wrist, but I don't find that comfortable, as bend my wrist and elbow when I hammer.It was also noted by someone that the hammer head isn't ground. While I have swung it, I've never tested nail driving with it, but the problems with the hammer head don't surprise me.Basically, for the idiots now running Stanley, ""they don't make 'em like they used to."""
5,Use after use.,"The Fubar comes in handy very often, and has good angles for the nail pullers. It's balanced well, and the grip is comfortable while providing a non-slip feel. The grip also doesn't fall apart during use the way some softer material do.When working 2 x X's, it has enough length to provide the necessary torque to break them away from other pieces. It's a tight enough fit that the control is there to hold 2 x X's steady as well."
5,An Excellent Book for the Christian Healthcare Professional,"This book discusses in a beautiful way how God in Christ can be met in the midst of the often-heartbreaking challenges of today's American healthcare system. As a medical student, I found that his ""Meditations"" places our role as healthcare professionals caring for the sick within a broader redemptive context of God's plan for His creation. I highly recommend this book for those who find themselves frustrated with the current situation of medical care and seek renewal of hope for its future."
5,Excellent character development,"This is definitely a great game. Sure the enemies/bosses are easy to defeat (just case a defensive spell and it will heal you as well as increase defense), but the story is great. A lot of sexual innuendo. You get to dive (enter the mind of your reyvatails), and get to know them more. The girls have very similar problems people (both boys and girls) deal with."
4,Ar Tonelico,"I really enjoyed this game. I think the areas were more diverse and varied than the second game and the controls were a little easier on my thumbs. The translation could have been better, but I like the fact that you aren't limited to only one girl's higher level songs. I didn't like the endings very much, though. There really wasn't anything bad about them, I just hate open endings. Over all it was a great game and I highly recommend it and it's sequel to anyone looking for a little variety in their RPG library."
3,A Game Worth Playing Once,"This game, Ar Tonelico: Melody of Elemia, has a pretty good story-line and some good characters, but sometimes, the game play just seems a little too easy. The graphics, however, are deffinately what holds this game back for me; it seemed more like I was playing a PS1 game instead of a PS2 game, especially with all of these awsome games of late that have proven that great graphics add to a game to make a life-like experience.Pros:Interesting storyInteresting CharactersNew Battle approachCons:Unexciting graphicsUnexiting battling and walkthrough"
1,outdated software,"CAUTION: Little Bear: Preschool Thinking Adventures (Jewel Case)is NOT compatible with modern Macintosh operating systems. For Macintosh, you must be running very old ""Classic"" software for this title to run. I suspect the same is true for Windows. I bought this for my two boys. I inserted the title into my Macintosh, running OS 10.5, and discovered that Little Bear only ran on computers running VERY OLD operating systems. Beware!!!"
3,"Cute, but difficult to navigate.........","It's little Bear so it has to be cute. My 3 1/2 year old likes it but gets frustrated since it not exactly easy to navigate. I myself finally got frustrated and we put in a different game. For Little Bear fans who just want an extra game around, get it. Otherwise I'd probably recommend an alternate."
1,Lttle Bear PreSchool Thinking Adventure,I also had the same problem as the previous conumer. When we click to go back it returns to the start - maybe an operating system problem? We are running Windows XP.
4,"five star material, 2star performance",as with the little bear toddler discoveries; this game that i just purchased also does not work properly. i am assuming since there are several other reviewers that had the same problem that it is not my newer computer. i had a computer tech come to check it out and he said that it was the software; although not defective; just unable to perform on most computers. very disappointed to find that out as the little bear games are not only developmentally appropriate for teh ages they are geared toward but they also offer children an opportunity to play in a non-aggressive manner; which many computer games do not offer. no point in sending it back as a replacement (if i coudl even get one) would still perform the same so we play until the game freezes or locks up on us or wont let us move on to the next spot. we just go into it knowing it could only be a five minute activity or a 20 minute one.
2,doesn't work,I am also having problems with it returning to start. We are running Windows XP. Any one have any suggestions on how to fix it. it seems like a really good game if it worked.
1,the best,"cherry,please come on tour to germany,soon,please,please,please. I LOVE YOU!(and I'm a young man,YEAAAAAAASSSas).(young in the heart)"
2,A hodge-podge of chapters written mostly by accountan ts.,About half the chapters are written by various accountants employed by Price Waterhouse. Only 2 out of about 20 chapter authors are recognizable names in the field.
1,A poor effort,"I dislike this book for a number of reasons. Firstly it is incomprehensible, especially the examples. Some of the concepts are also not well explained. Secondly, it is not user-friendly. The ideas demonstrated are not presented in a coherent manner. Lastly, being basically a compilation from different authors, the chapters are also not well connected to each other. Overall a very poor effort."
2,read this before going for it,"This book provides a very incomprehensive and inadequate exposition of many of the key issues. The first four chapters are the most poorly written with unexplained examples. The book, moreover, gives a very poor explanation of pricing techniques which should have formed the core of this text. ON the whole, i would not recommend it to anyone who wants to gain a good introduction to this topic at this price."
3,"I was a victim of David Sconce, but this book is only part!","I am one of David Sconce's victims. I had entered into a business relationship with him and got burned (figuratively!). We first found out about him when we saw him arrested on the local news!Having been involved in part of the situation, the book is accurate for the most part, however the writing is uneven. Given what I saw and heard I doubt none of the other gruesome details the author presents.David Sconce appeared to be a nice, well mannered businessman that was too good to be true! That he was a ghoal of the worst kind still chills me to the bone. I am lucky he didn't come after me and my family."
4,gruesome as it gets.,"I've seen several of the sites illustrated in this book and they perfectly hide some creepy stories. I would have given this book five stars although it had way too many typos and mistakes (did anyone proof read the final copy)? Sorry to say in our lost generation this book would be a great movie ""a gruesomenever to be forgotten movie""."
5,The Second Time Around,"I read this book about 15 years ago and it was thrilling. Now 15 years later it is still thrilling and I am thinking about reading it a third time. A must read and surprised it has not been made into a movie. A good chilling and thrilling read. It is so bizarre that it is hard to belleive that it is non-fiction. Although I must admit, it is not for the faint at heart or the squeamish."
4,Single guy,"A single guy who lost out on his first love, several years ago, goes to Monte Carlo to try to forget his woes. There he meets up with a cute girl and makes plans to spend Christmas with her. But, forget about her. He does, when he almost runs over a little girl who wants to find her missing father, since it's Christmas Eve."
4,Picture is misleading,"I am glad to know the previous customer said the picture is misleading. The picture displayed are for the S and Tr model laptops. I wasn't going to purchase this item because there seemed to be ambiguity. (The A series power adapter is very different looking, and has very different power specs)."
1,Stopped working after only 3 months,I bought this adapter to replace the original which was damaged. Now this stopped working after only 3 months of use. Very disappointed!
1,1 case = 1 binder,"I basically paid $65ish for 2 binders, when it clearly says ""12 Binders (1 case)."" I don't know if the other 22 binders were back-ordered, but that doesn't make much sense. Luckily, there was no problem returning this product."
5,"A wonderful, heartfelt CD","If you're looking for a CD with wonderfully composed love songs this is the one for you. All of the songs are beautifully written and his voice is that of an angel. From the upbeat ""Doggin' Around"" to the melodic ""Baby be mine,"" all get a perfect 10. This is a CD to be listened to with someone you love. Great songs, great voice, great music."
2,Can't tell a book by its cover,"I picked this up on the fly one day at the grocery. I recognized the name, but had never read anything by Ms. Camp. The cover was beautiful and the blirb had potential. Boy was I mistaken. Cardboard characters, predictable plot. I suppose I should be grateful for the gawfaws sparked by the ridiculous love scenes. In mortal danger, need to be really quiet? Let's pause and make out, 'cause that's what any intelligent person would do. Geesh. And by the way, that lovely pink dress had absolutely nothing to do with a single scene (good marketing, though!). So, I will leave Ms. Camp to her loyal fans, but I won't be one of them."
3,"NOT ""SO WILD A HEART"" BUT. . .","I read SO WILD A HEART (and another book whose name I can't remember) and fell in love with Candace Camp's style. Naturally I rushed to Amazon.com and ordered another book by Ms. Camp. That book was SCANDALOUS. The description was too much to resist but the actual story was a little bit of a let down. It is a somewhat light weight story compared to the other two books I've read by Ms. Camp. Not as much tension, sexual or mystery wise, the characters were too perfect (I like a little character flaw in my hero), and the story in general just didn't grab hold and make you want to stay up all night reading. Not a keeper but an okay read."
2,Bent in the mail,"This item got bent in the process of shipping, not very strong. The binder has not frayed or broken any other way, but I was disappointed in the items' ability to bend so easily."
5,easy read informative knowledgeable,"I love this book. what a masterful collection of articles! itis so easy to read yet I learned so much. I go to a conservative shulbut have recommended this to many friends from across the spectrum and Jewish Matters has been warmly received everywhere. It is funny and moving, simply lovely. big thumbs up."
5,"attractively presented,well-written book of Jewish essays","Doron Kornbluth has taken the considerable trouble of cheerleading, gathering, and editing an all-star cast of Judaism's premier educators and thinkers into one attractively formatted and priced volume of wide-ranging topical essays that are relevant not just to your grandmother, mother, you, and your kids, but it's even a book you can give to the person who theologically bugs you the most. A great read for everyone. Hurray for Doron."
5,even better than 24...and more fun,"Didn't even know about this USA cable show...but seeing he pilot, instantly hooked and had to get the whole first season...then the second...and of course no better way to watch than the non-commercial DVD. Intriguing, but with a humerous twist...this guy is the perfect definition of COOL...and the Mimi-vice like beautiful scenery of Miami is just an extra!"
1,Quiet Joy by Doc Lew Childre,"This album contains nothing new - it is simply a repeat of numbers contained in Childre's two previous albums, and not worth the money. I think this should be made clear to people who are thinking of buying it - I personally feel cheated."
2,Too conversational,"The reason I dislike this book is that it is written in a conversational style, which is very hard to follow. Being a beginner at this, it would be much more helpful if things were separated and clearly emphasized step by step. This book makes it difficult because all proofs are written into a big block of a paragraph. I normally have taken an hour or so to decode a paragraph so that I can say ""Oh! That's what he meant."" The content is good- layout is bad."
2,Too conversational,"This book should be given a rating lower, if it were possible. The reason I dislike this book is that it is written in a conversational style, which is very hard to follow. Being a beginner at this, it would be much more helpful if things were separated and clearly emphasized step by step. This book makes it difficult because all proofs are written into a big block of a paragraph. I normally have taken an hour or so to decode a paragraph so that I can say ""Oh! That's what he meant."" The content is good- layout is bad."
5,What's with all these negatived reviews?,"This book is written in a simple style: algoritm class description, related proofs, examples, variations and exemples. Because of this clean approach, you can basically read it in a couple days if you have the necessary background knowledge, and in a couple weeks if not. I strongly recommend this book to everyone who are calling themselves ""programers"", either graduated or not, it will teach/remind them what are the elegant fundamental algorithmic approches to common problems; it's seems that today's software could use a bit of this elegance. As for all the negative reviews, I'm astonished. I own several books on the subject, and I find this one the easiest to read, no question. It must be some sort of personal vendetta against the author, a failed undegraduate course with this book as teaching material, or some other personal reason; that's probably why this/these person(s) whish(es) to remain anonymous."
1,Not very good,"I didn't like the organization of the book. It starts with page after page of the mathematics used to analyze algorithms. This could be shortened considerably. Then an analysis of some multiplication algorithms which are poorly explained. Most explanations are long winded and the pseudocode isn't that great. The one section that is o.k. is on probabilistic algorithms, including prime number generation and a little cryptology. In general there are many better books of this kind (Sedgewick, Baase, Corman, Aho, etc.)so that one wonders why this book is even out there. Maybe the author feels that organizing the book based on algorithmic technique as opposed to algorithmic function will help the reader. Sometimes it's just annoying since things like sorting are spread all over the book depending on the techniques used for the sort. Choose another book for algorithms."
1,Fundamentals of Algorithmics,"Wow...I don't understand how this book can be used in an introductory course to algortithm analysis. I can see where readers with a great deal of mathematical skill would like this book, because that is the only way you are going to understand any of it. There are too many instances where the authors gloss over their explanations, saying that the answer is ""Easily derived"". If you have a Ph.D in Mathematics and an entry level skill of programming you might like this book. Otherwise, avoid it all cost."
1,"Obtuse, incomplete explanations","I had the misfortune of enduring this book during a graduate level course in algorithm analysis. Bad writing and incomplete explanations make the book a bad choice to learn this complex topic. Most of the itricate and particularly tricky parts of various proofs are left as ""exercise to the reader""! Why bother when there are so many better ones to choose from?"
5,Nice book. Hope to get similar books regarding this topic soon!!!,"For my Master Degree Studies on Computer Science, this book has been very helpful for an Algorithm Analysis Course. Maybe there are a couple of chapters that need more understanding than others, but overall if you are interested on this field, this book is probably a good source of information in order to plan my thesis in a near future.Most of my classmates purchased the First Edition Used and according to them the notes posted on some of those copies were nice.Overall this book is a must have for every developer out there that wants to become a researcher in Math with Computer Science!!!"
4,Fun!,"Not as good as ""If A Man Answers"", but if you like Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin as much as I do, you'll love it. Supporting cast is great too!"
1,Disappointed,I bought these films for a friend who lives in Belgium and when she went to play them it says she was forbidden to view them as they lived in the wrong zone. What the heck is that all about and why didn't someone say there were zones in the world for film viewing. How stupid things have become. Fortunately I know someone who can break the code and allow her to view them. But what a hassle. I won't be buying films anymore from Amazon.
5,Good product,Received product much sooner than expected; quality was great and nothing broken. Was exactly what I expected with no problems.
3,Old fashion fun,Sandra Dee shows some real talent for acting and for comedy. Nita Talbot was exceptionally good as the wise cracking Eve Arden Type.
5,Gifted Woman,"I am a huge Howard Schatz fan. This book raises awareness of the impact that women have made on our society. These black & white portraits are so well-crafted, they often need no words to describe the subjects. Short texts do accompany the photographs. Especially appropriate for young women exploring their life possibilities. Provides inspiration by showing real women who have made a difference in every area of modern life."
3,Timeless Inspirational Music,I purchased this CD to add to the CD collection that I use for my daily six mile walks on our clubhouse treadmill. The various theme songs are relaxing and inspirational. They bring back memories of some excellent movies from the not too distant past.
1,Use another book,"I waited for this book to be available for weeks. When I finally got it I found it was completely useless.I got a 5.5 on the TWE, and I can tell you the exam is not about memorizing patterns as this book tries to teach. You just need to know about grammar and how to answer the question you are asked in a standard way.Besides missing the objective of the exam, the size of the pages and the font used make the book unreadable.I strongly recommend you Barron's ""How to Prepare for the Computer-Based Toefl Essay: Test of English As a Foreign Language"" instead of this book."
2,"One-dimensional characters, poor plotting.","Nick and partner Stefan Borowski head for a Caribbean Club Med to escape academic departmental politics. But, of course, it follows them there, and then there is a murder. Nick, who is a PI manqué, naturally must investigate, especially as he and Stefan find the body and it appears that someone is trying to implicate him.Not one of Raphael's best. Too many of the characters are one-dimensional, with no clear motivations for their behavior. Plotlines appear and disappear with no resolution. The solution to the mystery comes out of left field, as the murderer, for no apparent reason, decides to divulge all to Nick and then flee. Even WITH a confession, there's no satisfactory motivation for the murder.And, Lev? While you may not care for Michael Cunningham's work, too much sniping at him in your book looks like professional jealousy. Tone it down."
4,Continuing a good series,"I was getting sort of tired of the awful academic infighting and backbiting (backstabbing?) at the University so really enjoyed the change of scene. The descriptions of the food are so mouthwatering they make you hungry,,,and thank God he has played down Nick's weird interest in that blowsy Juno!! A good read."
3,problem solvers,"This book had some good suggestions, but it dealt with her specific problems. It gave me some good ideas."
4,Help! Brick walls,I am sure that this book will prove very useful in my genealogy research. It is easy to follow with good examples.
2,"Too narrow in focus, and dated.","If your brick walls are the immigrant generation, do yourself a favor and get a book specializing in that country's research rather than this one. Despite the 2005 copyright, the majority of the advice would have still held true a decade ago. And the emphasis on early American record issues is a real minus for those with later arriving ancestors. Despite the introduction's suggestion, the problem-solving techniques alone weren't worth the lack of examples in my problem areas.However, if you've been working on your genealogy for decades, need a refresher, and are working on your DAR application... you might love this book."
5,"Very good book, different from the rest",I just finished reading this book and I loved it! Ancient Ireland is not a setting which is found in a lot of books and I found the tale very interesting. I really felt like I could picture virtually every aspect of the story while I was reading it.
3,Not as good as her other work,"Although this is a decent book, I was disappointed after reading Osborne-McKnight's I Am Of Irelaunde and Bright Sword of Ireland. The characters in her other books are less stereotyped, and I loved her work with the stories of the Hound of Ulster and St. Patrick. This book fits more into the romance category, while the others had real depth and innovation."
4,An Excellent Resource,"This is a must read reference source for the those wishing to understand how child molesters build trust in their victims. It is not a difficult read and is helpful in identifying ""suspicious"" behavior. My only problem is that it is quite repititious; however, Van Dam explains the repitition by demonstrating the molesters' modes of operation are frequently very similar."
5,The Grand Master had not lost her touch,"This book is vintage Andre Norton. I enjoyed it so much, I am going to attempt to get a hardbound copy so it will last longer than my paperback will. If you are a Andre Norton fan, do not miss out on this book. I can only hope that she will write a sequel. There were so many things that I would like to see enlarged upon. For instance, will Jofre confront the Shagga priests and vindicate himself with the Brotherhood of Shadows. Are he and Tanyan bonded as a couple? What race of people did Jofre come from? What happened to his parents? Why was his escape pod ejected from whatever ship he was on as a baby? What other adventures will our intrepid Zacathan, Shadow Brother, Shadow Sister and Yat encounter? There are so many possiblities open."
4,Anvery gratifying read,Andre Norton as long been one of my favorite authors and one can but hope that there will be more of these books coming.
5,A real gut buster,"Hilarious,Laugh out loud funny,Laughed so hard I was crying man.!! Friggen Awesome !!If you need to forget your troubles for an hour or so,this is the medicine you need..He's a comedic genius.The way he weaves his stories."
5,Delivers 100%,He just nails it. He is one of the best comedians out there and this special has some of his best stuff.
3,Bill Burr 2,My son loves Bill Burr and is very happy with this DVD which I bought for his birthday last year.
1,terrible,"Dont waste your time on this one. There is too much profanity, it detracts from the comedy. I had to just turn it off, I dont find it funny to use the Lords name in vain."
1,Unfunny,"I realize humor is subjective but this guy brings a new low to observational ""humor""--at least I think this is humor. The F-word may get a laugh but there is nothing clever in anything he says. And the audience still howls? Here's my one-word review, a variant on the F-word he relies on for punch lines: Sucks."
3,"Good, but not great","Many comedians use bad stuff in humans to make a joke. Most succeed quite well. Bill does a few times, but not always. He seems to harp on some of them that were funny at first until they become boring and no longer funny. Oh well."
5,Awesome! Hilarious!!!,"This is a comedian at the top of his game. After seeing a piece of this special on Comedy Central (which made me cry in some places it was so funny), I set out to see the entire, unedited version.Bill Burr manages to balance the inner grouch in all of us, with a few subtle heartfelt moments (see his dog bit). But all the while, he's attacking!I like this guy. I've been a fan because of this DVD and have never looked back."
1,Laugh Track,"I was about 30 seconds into the video when I realized that they had to add a laugh track. Never does he pause for applause, react to the audience, and there are a number of shots where the audio is laughing yet the audience is sitting still. The routine was OK, but I could not get past the laugh track. I quit at the 14 minute mark, because I could not help but notice that the laughs were too consistent and matched his timing perfectly. It is truly sorry when a Comic lets something like this to be released."
2,Less than I had hoped for,"This product has the potential for excellence. However there are several features through out the CD which were unavailable. For example, the on-line lessons did not exist. When I called the technical support. I was told they did not know when they would be available.Some features are very good however. The dictionary is worth the price of the software. And the book is excellent. It is the actual lessons, the lack of clear information, how to use the features which is so disappointing. I would not re-buy this product.DD"
4,Great Software to learn spoken german,I have been very pleased with this purchase. It is well tailored to teach spoken German. The software starts with basic words and fairly quickly introduces conversation sequences from relevant situations. Voice recording allows the user to hear is own voice and compare it with that of a native speaker a feature which helps learning the correct pronunciation. Grammar is reviewed thoroughly but is not very well exercised.
2,Perry Mason DVD,wish it was in color...black & white takes away the luster.Do you have any Perry Mason DVD's in color?Please indicate clearly & unmistakenly whether or not a dvd is in color or black & white. That is a huge indicator as to whether or not I will purchase it.
5,The classic series hits its stride,"Some reviewers were a bit surprised by the Perry Mason they saw in the excellent first season -- devious and a bit on the edge of the law, not above misdirecting the police or tampering with evidence to benefit his client.Here in season 2, the characters have settled down a bit (although Perry is not above a bit of sharp practice), Perry and Tragg seem to have made up, and the puzzles are rather more difficult. In Season 1, I could often see the answer ahead of time, but here it's usually a surprise, at least until the trap is being sprung.Since these episodes were filmed and the prints were kept in good condition, these DVDs look gorgeous, even in black-and-white. Classic late-50's period drama, yet somehow never dated."
5,Very well done!,Perry Mason is my all time favorite television series. I have been exceedingly pleased with all the Perry Mason DVD's in this package. I have ordered each one upon release and have been pleased with all of them. I do wish they would be released in a more timely fashion.
2,"A decent pan, but not durable","The pan is of good thickness, and cooks well, but it doesn't take long for the paint to come off. Needs a anodized finish instead of mere paint."
3,The Gonzagas are Masked,"This book is heavy on romance and light on history. I found it disappointingly shallow. The reader does come away with a picture of aristocratic life at that time (assuming every aristocrat lived on the Gonzaga level). I expected a history of the Gonzaga family, but this book focuses on Francisco in the middle of the line with brief reference to those before and following."
2,"Really, Really Bad","I got this after enjoying Mr. Sollscher's 11-String Baroque CD. However, the sound on this CD is not as good, and the interpretations of this music leaves a lot to be desired - a LOT! In general, lute players offer much better interpretations of Renaissance and Baroque music than guitar players, and this CD proves it. It sounds to me like this CD was mainly made as a commercial opportunity, with very little care given to the music. Save your money or shop elsewhere, as this is a very unsatisfactory CD."
5,The PERFECT Halloween party of a movie!,"Super fun flick - Sort of a funky, cool homage to all the vintage monster movies it's based on. Frankenstein, Dracula, Werewolf, vampires, etc. all rolled into one. The casting & actors are superb! Awwwesome special effects, costuming & period sets. Visually robust w/ an amaaazing rendition of Dracula played by Richard Roxburgh. His super hot 3 vampire wives are not to be missed. An all-star cast, including Hugh Jackman & Kate Beckinsale in sexy roles that rival X-Men & Underworld, if you can believe that. The bonus features are well done & well worth the extra few bucks. A little tongue-in-cheek but entirely entertaining, esp. if you watch it more than once."
4,excellent,le blu ray est d'excellente qualité. Le film est très spectaculaire avec des effets spéciaux très bien faitsEn france nous n'avons pas autant de choix de films en blu rayContinuez à proposer vos blu ray en all zone pour que nous puissions les acheter chez vous aux states
4,"Great movie, totally worth buying","[[ASIN:B002HML6Y8 Van Helsing [Blu-ray]I have watched Van Helsing many times before, but viewing it on Blu-ray on my HDTV brings it to a whole new level. The little details that I never thought I would notice are clear as day. From the actors wrinkles to the detailed fur on the Wolf Man. The sound is sweet just as well. I just wish I had a home theater system to excel the experience of watching the movie.I like Van Helsing for several reasons. It captures the interest of many viewers with action, science fiction, comedy and romance. Even though it's a little more than two hours long, I sat on the edge of my seat through the whole film the first time I watched it. Van Helsing is one of my favorite movies, and I would recommend buying it on Blu-ray to get all the extra bonus features."
3,Come on... it was fun,"This movie seemed to be all about the 'why not?' factor... a werewolf battling a vampire? why not? a swearing monk? why not? spandex pants during the victorian age? why not? The brains behind Van Helsing completely threw logic and reason to the wind and ended up with a movie that can only be described as fun. No one involved with this movie, from the actors to the costume designers (once again, spandex in the victorian age??) seemed to be taking themselves very seriously and just had a good time with the flick... so naturally nobody else should be taking this movie to seriously either, its a good campy time at the movies"
3,NO BLEEDING!!!,"Pretty good movie, the music was outstanding, but the love-story plotline kills the whole point. =\ I love the animations... but when Mr. Hyde gets his arm chopped off, no blood. Okay, a bit unrealistic. The wolfman and Dracula look awesome, and I love the set design. A good movie, go see it if you've got time to kill."
2,"what a letdown, all flash and no interest","All CGI hype and pizazz, but not much of a story to keep you interested. As the movie goes on, it bogs down horribly, making you look at your watch. But it just goes on and on, all effects and fighting and so on, but no compelling characterization to keep any interest. I have to say, I hated this movie. I wanted to love it. The atmosphere and look of the movie was brilliant, but what needed serious polishing wasn't the look of the movie, but the script itself."
3,Great Movie--over-dose of action,"I've loved Universal's horror films before I even watched them. Dracula is my personal favorite. He seems pretty weird in this movie. The animation, plot and setting is great. I'm glad the monsters have new revamped looks. A pretty good movie. A bit too action-oriented, though."
2,does anybody else miss Indy's sexy fedora?,"From Jackman's appallingly ugly hat to the blatantly-ripped-off-from-LXG version of Jekll/Hyde, from the Vatican's knockoff versions of M and Q to Beckinsale's anachronistically skanky Princess Anna, this movie was THE SUCK.Frankly, the only good points were the vampires - campy, yes, but wonderfully so. Particularly the opening sequence, where Dracula's deceptively attractive face is overlaid by flashes of a horrifying monster, and it becomes very clear that this vampire has none of the sweet, cuddly qualities so common in many modern vampire depictions - he is utterly evil.But besides Dracula? THE SUCK."
3,Mediocre Creature Feature,"This movie is like a throwback to Universals 1950s creature features. While I understand that it's meant to be an homage to those films, this just doesn't do it for me. Granted the special effects are very good, but the plot is thin and the story kind of jumbled up. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are very good, but both are capable of so much more. As horror flicks go, it's good, but don't expect to see anything knew or exciting in this film."
2,Pretty to look at - nothing else,"Van Helsing is pretty. Visually, I mean.But all these pretty pictures are nothing when there is no story to support them!And here is the catch - if you ever watched Buffy, or Angel, or X-files you will find this movie laughable. Those shows took horror and mystic elements seriously, and showed what could be done with them.This movie ... well ... how is this: ""Vampires are allready dead, so their children are stillborn"" - if it makes sence to you (together with the fact, that those children are some big bats, who turn into green goo, when they die) - then watch this movie. Otherwise steer clear. Mr Sommers seems to think that the appeal of pulp movies of the 30s is in their naive stories, but he somehow forgets, that naive doesn't mean stupid!The concept of Van Helsing in itself has potential (which is demonstrated in a comic book prequel, which is better then the movie).(...)"
1,Couldn't even watch it all,"Van Helsing is no doubt the worst movie of 2004 next to Garfield and Chronicles of Riddick. This movie is so boring and filled with too many CGI effects the only scenes we made it to were the the b&w prologue and the scene were Van Helsing and the womman were battling white monsters. Please avoid this one like the plague, This one is recommended for video gamers and 10 year old kids but if you have trouble sleeping watch this movie to get a better sleep."
1,Stupid,"Van Helsing is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. All Van Helsing does is try to kill a vampire. He stabs it, shows it a cross, puts holy water on it and tries to beat it up. I have never been a fan of scary vampire movies but this was horrible. Frankenstien was even in the movie. What does Frankenstien have to do with Vampires? Van Helsing is a serial killer that gets hired to kill monsters. I saw it in a movie thearter for a birthday and I wanted to leave but I couldnt. There was also a girl in the movie that tries to help Van Helsing kill the Vampire because her whole family got killed trying to kill the Vampire. In the end Van Helsing ends up killing her. Dont watch Van Helsing."
1,where the ***** is the justice???!,"this piece of **** gets a 3 disc ultimate edition when Hulk is a much better movie, I bet there are other titles from universal that deserve a 3 disc then this peice of *****!this movies doesn't deserve ******! I would never recommend this movie to my friends or even worse my enimies.. this is just a plain bad movie piece of *****It deserves no ******** stars either!JACOB"
1,Van Crapsing,"Total crap. An absolute, total and complete, one hundred percent crapfest. And worst of all, its boring crap. Crappity crap crap."
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this movie but it falls short. Almost non-stop action the whole time- unfortunately this gets repetitive after a while, as do the computer-generated affects, some of which, particularly the brides of Dracula, are admitedly impressive. However, others such as the Mr. Hyde CG character looked more like something out of 'Shrek'. Beckinsale's accent was cartoonish. Her and Jackman's acting talents are mostly wasted as there is little character developement. And the plot--Dracula needs Frankenstein to give life to his thousands of dead vampire babies. Huh??Save your money and get out your ""An American Werewolf in London"" or ""Interview with a Vampire"" DVD's for some truly satisfying horror-genre entertainment."
3,Best in small bites.,"The best way to watch this movie is in small doses. Watch ten or fifteen minutes and then stop to watch something else. If you watch it all in one shot, it is too overwealming. This movie is mostly frosting with little cake. If you watch in in more than one sitting, it is much more enjoyable and coherent."
2,Van Helsing against the Cartoon People,"Somehow they managed to get beautiful fresh-faced Kate Beckinsdale and lather enough make-up on her to make her a candidate for Madame Tussaud's wax museum. A bit to aggressive with the hair curling thingie didn't help either. No lead had enough ""quiet"" time in which to establish a character...they had the depth of Playstation 3 people. All the CG monster's just moved too fast. The thing that bothered me the most...1/3 of the film occurs in ""dark-o-vision""...it's so dark you can barely discern what is happening. Combine that with the hyper active fight scenes and rapid fire editing...and whole scenes occur that don't involve us simply cause we are confused on what is going on. I would think there could be some frightining scenes, maybe some tension and dread, heck it's got the grand trio of monsters...nope, not here. We've seen enough how movies are made specials that we are bored by CG cartoons. The ""face in the sky"" ending was embarressing."
1,I would give it -5 stars if I coul,"This movie is a ******* mess... if Shelley and Stoker were here w/ us, they would probably commit suicide after watching this terrible movie. It's just the worst distortion of the original stories I've ever seen. Yes, the special effects are great; yes, Hugh Jackman portrays Van Helsing in a very ""Wolverine"" way and yes, Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous; but this movie represents a literary crime in the worst degree... What a waste of time!"
1,This movie sucks harder than CGI vampires,"No dramatic tension whatsoever, no surprises, hinges entirely on FX and computer graphics. Initially promises some tounge-in-cheek horror and witty one-liners but delivers an endlessly boring and intensely annoying barrage of loud horrible music, unsurprising explosions and silly CGI characters. Might have been ok much shorter and as a spoof. As it stands, it's not even a farce, it's just a rancid pile of vomit. It reeks - an actual cinematic turd! Am I being too harsh? - I could go on. As nutty as squirrel poo!"
1,The producers spent lots of money for a turkey of a movie...,"I think movies have been steadily getting worse overall for the last couple of years. It seems like Hollywood must think that the public is so dumb that they'll go see anything with a big budget and lots of special effects. They forgot about having a decent story on this one. It's not the actors fault; I love Kate Beckinsale, Hugh is good as Wolverine, and the Dracula guy is actually pretty cool, but the plot sucks. I saw this at a matinee and still felt like I wasted my money. Don't buy this, rent it if you must."
2,"good comedy, even kind of gooffy","A more than queer Dracula, a clumsy good-for-nothing Frankenstein's monster, a hideously exaggerated Mr. Hyde, a lot of alien like (born from hanging insect chrysalides?) baby vampires and three subnormal bimbo Dracula's brides make me laugh so much I though I would drop dead.Nice special effects, although too much computer stuff (that justifies the extra star. would rate it one instead)."
2,An expensive mistake,"Films like this really should not have millions wasted on their being made, and the box office returns really did not much make up for it. Overall this movie is crap-tacular (though not as crap-tacular as if the events of this film were to occur in real life.)"
2,weak movie skinned with good looking CG,"the directing of this movie is really poor, the the camera always rotate insanely fast anytime you found something flying in sky, which when you realise that later it looked really boring because its like telling you straightly this part is done in CGI and its fake so it spin so fast so you dun find the glitches in details... so poor, the directing is a big time sucker, the director is the worse i've seen for doing this kind of big bugget movie, the whole drop bored even they managed to give you CGI thril every couple of minutes. Dracula - the Bram Stocker one from 10 years ago is absolutely better than this crap, such a pitty.. more of these the holywood will drop dead liek these vampires.. 2 stars are all given to CGI studio, zero for anything else involved."
1,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"This is, hands down, the worst movie I have ever seen. I honestly don't even know where to begin... from the nonsensical plot, over-reliance on special effects, lack of chemistry, poor casting and a baffling amount of rope swinging (!). Don't waste your time."
3,But Can Vampires Kill WereWolves?,"The special effects are very good but the effort to blend Dracula, Frankenstein, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, 'The Brides of Dracula', the Wolfman and 'Dracula vs. the Wolfman' [or is it 'Frankenstein vs. the Wolfman?] all together does get a little confusing.Frankenstein's Monster is kind of a good guy and Dracula, although every inch a bad guy, is fascinating. Igor is a real jerk. Dracula's brides are really quite something although I don't know why they are nippleless. Maybe it's because their goblin babies are hatched dead already and need human blood rather than milch. I never really figured it out."
3,yeah...but...,"It wasn't my idea. It was on Encore one morning, and then again and again, and over the next few months my kids and I got hooked, so I bought the DVD. Yeah, it's a mess of kitsch, and the dialogue is standard drivel---but somehow the effect of the whole is fun, probably because everyone in the cast looks like they had a blast making it."
3,Van helsing? A one time deal!,Van helsing was a great film the first time i saw it but the second and third? it got boring. It was also very bloody but i liked the story line and plot. Also count dracula and his brides look so fake when they were bird-bat things. It shows that the movie costed alot but the outcome wasnt that good. If its haloween night or u feel like spooking ur self out u should watch it just one. Maximum twice.
4,Great if taken with a grain of salt,"Don't expect a horror movie. Don't expect the film to follow the original stories. Hell, don't even expect good dialogue or acting. Regardless, this film is thoroughly enjoyable unles you happen to be an elitist movie monster ""guru"" with stick-up-ass syndrome. It's a fun movie, and great for an occasional much-needed dose of corny goodness."
3,Could have cared more...,"I liked the movie. Saw it in the theater and rented it later. It was very exciting. Fast moving. Almost too fast. The characters weren't developed enough. The film didn't give enough background on the characters for the viewer to give a rat's behind about what happened to them. Hugh Jackman? Always happy to sit and drool. Give me more Wolverine (X-Men Movies). Kate Beckensale? I'm sure in the right film she's lovely. Here, I could see any number of B film queens from the 70's in the role. Couldn't wait for her to get it in the end...and we knew she would, even though after the extreme beatings she took, we saw nary a bruise on her. Speaking of the end...could it have been any more ridiculously sappy? Please. Still, the film was, overall, entertaining and exciting. Happy viewing!"
5,Vampire Hunters!,"_Van Helsing_ is a decent action/horror movie about a monster hunter who must travel to Transylvania to meet Dracula and his minions. If you enjoyed _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ you might enjoy this, because both feature the same Mr. Hyde character (who appears briefly at the beginning of this movie). Kate Beckinsale, as always, is just swell as the Transylvanian princess. The movie isn't anything heady but it is good fun. Enjoy!"
3,Underrated Movie,"Any fans of movies like ""The Mummy Returns"", ""Hellboy"", ""The Shadow"", and ""Fearless Vampire Killers"" might enjoy this movie. I enjoyed watching Van Helsing take on Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, Dracula, and werewolves. Hugh Jackman gives a fine performance as the hero for mankind. Anyone that wants a serious horror movie may find this silly. It was meant to be outragious but I certainly didn't think it was silly. This is more fun to watch than several horror movies I have seen. Plenty of action and CGI effects make it visually great. The acting is decent and the directing and music are okay as well. All-in-all a good action/adventure that has a good pace, wonderful effects, and a good story. I certainly plan to add it to my DVD library long before ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" or ""The Hulk""."
3,Van Helsing was overkill :(,"I love monsters, and i thought this movie would be awesome! Although the creatures/monster are awesome, i just felt like the movie was just ""OK."" It just didn't keep me captivated. I like Hugh Jackman, especially as Wolverine, but this is just so typically aweful at times. Kate Beckinsale is a good actress and she was a highlight to the movie, but it was just cheesy, I'm sorry to say that is movie was a disappointment to me, but if you love monsters/creature of the Old, this is a movie for you, it just wasn't for me. It would of been nice to just have one monster per movie maybe, but it was just too much. Sometimes less is more!"
2,Van Hell-No!,"Ok, are you telling me that this is the same guy who directed ""The Mummy""? How can that be? ""The Mummy"" was actually enjoyable, unlike it's Transylanian counterpart. Apart from it's weak storyline, poor direction and mediocre effects Van Helsing also manages to be downright boring! This movie made me feel like a kid...and not in a good way! The directors adolescent attempts to frighten me with mythic monsters was ungrounded; he should have just let me read the script! Woefully bad characterizations of Hollywood horror standards left me feeling drained and baying at the moon. There was no bolt of lightning that could have broken the spell of boredom woven by this forgettable flick. If you decide to get this movie I want you to think less frightening and more fromage, less action and more assinine."
2,You've got to be kidding!,"I'm also an ENORMOUS fan of the Mummy movies and Universal classics, but this movie definitely lacked their ""something special"". It was ok if you were in a mood to get out of the heat and into an air-conditioned theatre to see a movie, but it can never be considered a cinematic classic. I walked in all set to be sucked in but the popcorn was more entertaining. I'm a movie fanatic & normally buy every movie I see on the big screen, but I think this one will just stay on the (Amazon) store shelf. Sorry."
3,Vanhelsing Blu Ray,"Product was mostly as described, was supposed to be brand new, but case was broken, top can not close. Other than that, great purchase."
3,Effects Sink Okay Goof,"If it weren't for the endless, clumsy shots of people flying thru the air, this would be a likeable goof, tho the decision to turn Van Helsing into the Ringo Kid is hard to explain. The Frankenstein Monster redesign is actually kind of neat (and his size is true to the book), but he is stuck griping about his tragic fate. Another mistake is the way every background goes on to infinity - just in poor taste. Kids will watch a drama without the silly effects overkill, especially if it includes monsters. Still, there are nice sets and costumes. Not a total failure, but flawed by an insistence on underestimating the intelligence of its audience."
1,"so much movie, saying so little, my head hurts","I watched Van Helsing last night. I want my time back. It reminded me of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but different. Kind of like, Wolverine hunts LOEG. The only good part was the end battle between VH and Dracula. The soundtrack is pretty good though, but the movie actually gave me a headache, just like Team America did.The mistake was trying to fit 3hrs of info into what I think was just under 2, then instead of condensing the script to give you the most story, the script was condensed to allow for the most visually lush and lavish scenes, and it never let up. Add to that the time inconsistencies (was night in a frame, woman steps forward, shot now from behind and it's daylight) to downright annoying acting (give me break on the friar)."
1,Annoyingly bad...:-(,"Eventhough i am a big fan of hugh + kate, i must say i did not like this movie. The acting of all the characters was bad and the plot was poor. In the whole the movie lacked originallity. I do not know if anybody else noticed, but i could see the microphones during many scenes in the movie. They appeared many times on the screen and that was really bad for the movie. The director should have been more careful, because his mistakes affected the image of the actors. His mistakes made the actors look at least foolish!"
2,Understandable - Van Helsing (Sommers),"I don't know why people vilified this movie so much. Probably because of the cheap CGI (like in ""Mummy Returns""). The story is stupid, the action sequences over the top, and all is irrelevant, but is fun nevertheless, and every action (even the stupidly impossible ones) is sliced in understandable bits of information (that is more that you can say about so many Hollywood films these days). Is a grandiose ""B"" movie (or rather a ""direct to video"" film) with a budget closer to ""Titanic"" than to ""Re-Animator"". But I will continue viewing Sommers' films, if he manages to slow down and acquire a better technique using the overblown effects that he likes. In the summer of 2004, two of my hopes for the pop-corn film (Sommers and Twohy) had failed (or at least that's what the public, the critics and the B.O. dictaminated). What went wrong?"
2,Mehh...,"Van Helsing was...bad.The plot was weak, most of the action scenes were laughable.The only funny thing was the ?monk?. He was hilarious.Most of the ""surprises,"" were not surprises.If the family had to kill dracula or go to hell (or something like that) then why didnt they have more than two children? And why hadn't their late 20's daughter not already had children? If she was willing enough to rebel and wear pants, why bother with the corset? Im sure they could have found something a bit more appropriate that still managed to have the sex appeal they were trying for.They needed to explain much more. Maybe if they had said, 9 of my siblings died fighting the supernatural beasts, we're the only ones left. Instead they left it unexplained.I would recemmend getting this movie from Netflix, or catching it on TV, where you dont have to pay much. The only thing that makes this movie worthwhile is the ?monk?."
2,The church gets their own Indian Jones,"The film is a CGI smorgasbord version of the old Universal features like Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman;The plots lameness is exceeded only by the miserable acting, as it was extremely tough for me to ""suspend belief"" and get into the story. A monster killed who has no memory set out to kill Dracula in Transylvania. But this is not a movie that was put out so we could measure it for credibility: it is two hours of entertainment: it is a movie that does not pretend to be anything but entertainment. It is not meant to be a classic horror tale nor a comic book, but instead something you can forget after 2 hours of wasted time.Van Helsing is the Indiana Jones of the church, with a mission is to capture monsters. How far can you go with a plot like that? About 2 hours."
3,"Decent, but not one of my favorites","This movie is what it is. My favorite charactors were Dracula's Brides.I know CGI is here to stay, but good Lord could we tone it down just a bit? I miss the good old days with stop motion action and people in costumes. The CGI looks just as fake as Stop Motion Puppets, but with CGI you feel like you're watching a video game instead of a film.Some people will like this, some won't. It's one of those movies you really have to see for yourself because everyone has an opinion on it."
2,Dumb and Boring,"Yea I wanted to see this movie my friend saw it he said it was awesome, my brother in law saw he said it was boring.And when I saw it I agree, theres no plot to it, and its boring and dumb the only scene I like its the action scene in the beginnig but its still dumb."
5,What a Great Idea!,"I'm not going to bore you with many details about this, but I think it was an awesome idea to make this package. After re-issuing the DVDs of the original movies that ""inspired"" Van Helsing, it's nice to see them packaged together so the influence is easily available to the true fan. Great package and a great idea!"
4,Great FUN!,"I couldn't wait to see this movie opening weekend, and I was not disappointed! It's a rollercoaster ride, to be sure! From the wonderful ""homage to horror films"" in the beginning to the dazzling non-stop action throughout, ""Van Helsing"" is a fantastical romp! Of course, the effects could easily steal the show, but Hugh Jackman holds his own - a bit stoically, but still quite good. And Kate Beckinsale is LOVELY! She is one gutsy gal! And the rest of the cast is also quite charming. Dracula's brides are hysterical and there are quite a few good one-liners that are worth repeating. The whole production is a blast, and I look forward to owning this on DVD when it comes out."
4,Downright Awesome,"This is one cool movie. I didn't think I would like it a lot, but I sure did. It has enough comedy, horror, adventure, and romance to keep it going for its lengthy thrill ride. This movie is just all-around fun. It has a great plot and wonderful actors. I don't know about the rest of you who saw it, but I really enjoyed it. I think it's worth seeing more than once. If you get a chance, see it. You'll probably enjoy it."
5,"Gabriel, The fan of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror","I Imagine that this movie will probably be like ""The Mummy Returns"" with Brandon Frasier. You know like Sommers the creator is brining back old 40s and 50s horror movies and turning them into a new century horror kind of comedy like movies. I think that van helsing will probably be better because Hugh Jackman has more challenges in the movie like the Wolfman, Frankinstein, and Draula. Over all I am looking foward to it in May.I finally seen the movie and it was disappointing in some areas. Dracua did not put up a good fight at the end and he acted like a sissy yet supposed to look bad? Second of all I did not like the ending to much when Kate Beckinsale died which was unexpected for the audience. Third of all some people are right that there are to many effects in the movie."
4,a very good time,"I love the old Frankenstein movies and other old horror movies, and I loved this movie from the first scenes. It was terrific fun, and funny, and I just really really had a good time watching it. The other great thing was that it made me realize my teenage son has huge gaps in his education -- he has never seen the orginial Frankenstein with Boris Karloff, or the Bride of Frankenstein. And it's been too long since I have seen them too, so I hope that Amazon has them on DVD..."
4,"Enjoyable,and exciting...................","Saw this movie yesterday and really enjoyed it,in fact my whole family did. It was off to a somewhat slow start but the action really picked up. I can't understand why people are so critical,sure it's Universal and the monsters are cheesy-looking, I still enjoyed it. I think it brought to life whole different version of why Frankenstein was like he was and why he was like he was. We went to enjoy this movie and we did,and I recommend it, Can't wait for the DVD...... Van Helsing was sooooooo hot...."
4,Enjoyable Fun for vampire werewolf and frankenfans,"I personally really enjoyed the move i thought the whole concept was cool and they put a great spin on Dracula who really makes the move- he has the charm worthy of three brides that you would expect from a guy whos been around a few hundred years. the girl's Transylvanian accent makes you want to kill yourself during the whole movie and youll wish that she were eaten by something in the movie, and the movie gets a little far fetched and tacked-on in the crumbling castle scene, but if you take it for what its worth- a cool twist on a monster movie- i thought it had a lot of fun and interesting elements. i wouldnt be looking for the greatest acting - its bubblegum for the mind, cool sets and wardrobes, neat props and some cool Special effects. I thought that the whole explanation of why dracula cant see his reflection in a mirror alone was worth seeing the movie for."
4,VAN HELSING DELIVERS!!,"VAN HELSING, though a tadbit weak in storyline, is a great popcorn fun fest that is sure to please action/adventure fans.Full of hair-raising special effects, Van Helsing is fast-paced and fun to watch. But the weaknesses were mainly semi-weak plot with Dracula being portrayed by a B-movie actor.But I'll be buying it mainly because I dig Hugh Jackman and Stephen Sommer's style of movie making. I hope he just get's grittier stuff than the Mummy type movies. I liked Van Helsing better than the Mummy movies myself, because the look of this film and it's pacing were excellent.Great mix of horror characters. I will be looking forward to his next endeavor in films..."
5,Fantastic in HD,"I enjoyed the original DVD and I don't see any mentions of the quality on HD DVD. I bought this HD DVD from Amazon and here are my comments:First of all, if you are not a Vampire, Dracula, Wolfman, or Frankenstein fan then you should not be revewing this DVD. This is without any doubt, the best of these type of movies and in HD even better. In HD details of this movie are nothing short of fansastic, my favorite scenes are Dracula's castle, Dracula's ballroom, Vampires attacking in the courtyard, Kate Beckinsale in the courtyard and ballroom dance with Dracula, Frankenstein's design, Werewolfs detail and much more. The Snow scenes and backround scenes are so detailed. Hugh Jackman's fight against Dr Jeckle, Mr Hide is a classic. How can anyone knock the fun of this movie, I don't know. BTW, this HD DVD has plenty of extras showing how the scenes were filmed. Hope there is another Van Helsing adventure in the works...."
4,SPECIAL EFFECTS EXTRAVAGANZA,"Comes off as more of an action/adventure than horror and is bestenjoyed if you adjust your expectations accordingly. From Mr.Hyde, to werewolves, to Frankensein's monster, and finallyCount Dracula himself, and lots of sexy vampires, Van Helsingcomes off like Indiana Jones on steroids! Packed with nonstopaction and outstanding special effects and visuals. Lots ofdark humor, and good fun all around. At a bit over two hourslong, it fits in perfectly for an evening of exceptionalentertainment. Highly recommended.Thanks, and enjoy,Tom"
5,Great Movie,"Van Helsing is a very good movie. Perfect if you are looking for a horror film to enjoy. Hugh Jackman is amazing.After the movie, I had to run to the internet and get more information on Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula. What a great performance ! He was the best Dracula yet !"
3,Fun Movie with Action,"If one is looking for a seroius horror movie based on the Horror Classics (e.g. Bram Stoker's Dracula), this isn't it. However, it has almost non-stop action with great special effects. The plot loosley weaves together the Dracula, Frankenstein, and werewolf characters in a ridiculous, but fun plot.A good movie for older kids (and me) who like horror movies of this nature. The action keeps the interest. I would buy the DVD when available. ""League of Mysterious Gentlemen"" is a movie with similar characteristics."
4,viewer,"i found the movie to be very good for singles and family. The Blu Ray picture was outstanding, far superior to the dvd. I would strongly recommend this"
3,"good story, bad monsters, bad special effects","Stephen Sommers used Dracula(1931 with Bela Lugosi), Frankenstein(1931 with Boris Karloff( and The Wolf Man(1941 with Lon Chaney, Jr.) to inspiried him to make the movie. He made a good story for Van Helsing, but he didn't think they were in a movie together before. Did he see Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein or House of Dracula?It was a good story. I'm fine with that. But what's with these monsters and the special effects? How is this like a vampire, Frankenstein or a werewolf? I am not seeing the same kind of monsters and the special effect that are in An American Werewolf in London, Curse of Frankenstein and Interview with the Vampire. I do like Van Helsing, but why isn't he Abraham instead of Gabriel?"
2,Very disappointing live action cartoon.,"People said the Mummy movies were too CGI dependant, possibly true, but they never took it to the ridiculous extremes shown in Van Helsing. Leaping off Notre Dame, swinging across huge chasms on chains, fighting werewolves and vampires and not so much as a spot of blood to mess up the faux period costumes. Jackman and Beckinsale clearly know they're in a cheap B movie and try their damnedest to salvage something from this mess, but to no avail. This could have been a fun movie, but the director lost the plot and I doubt the computer graphics people even read it. Rent or borrow, but don't buy."
2,um.....hehehe...ummmm,"no seriously...there actually are people who want to take the time to sit and write a huge long detailed review of this movie and all of the ""wonderful storyline"" and history behind the tale and all? why......?the first few minutes were very well done, say I. Afterwards, it just went from ppthhhhhhh to ppppppthhhhhhhhhhhh to PPPPPTTTTTTTYHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH to put it quite bluntly. The first encounter between v.h. and mr. hyde was totally unconvincing. And Dracula was just an obnoxious guy who walked around saying stupid lines. (""give me liiife"" ""that is not all I can do with your skin"" etc.etc.etc.) The CGI fx for our friends like the wolf-man and the vampires' flying forms were pretty darn fake looking.....the wolfman looked all smooth and blurry and not fitting in with the background at all. Sorryno, not worth buying or seeing more than 1 1/2 times"
2,Play the game insted,"What a film!!! I can't wait to get the video game. Or maybe that was a video game. The whole film looked like a series of XBOX cut scenes. Unlike XBOX you can't skip these when sitting in a movie theatre. I got headache imagining the thousands of crunching computers it would have taken to put together this mess. Apart from the CGI pornography, the uninspired dialogue is also straight out of video game land. The screenplay may have been written by someone in the post-production department. The guy who plays Dracula is mediocre at best, and the overacting of his female companions is absolutely ridiculous (or was this intentional?) I realize this film is somewhat tongue and cheek, but that's no reason for the film to be this bad. I am grateful that I had to go to the toilet and I missed about 10 minutes. I also fell asleep for another 10. Both stars are for the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale, she was the only reason I didn't go home."
3,"Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolf, Oh My!","A great idea... that has a little too many monsters to track. The movie is filled with lots of characters, maybe too many. But Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale make a good team! The fight seen at the end is a dizzying visual feast! I liked it, but others got a headache! A good movie, definetly worth a viewing! Recommend renting first to ensure it is to your taste before you buy."
1,dont buy,I was worried about this movie from the beginning. I like Hugh Jackman but this movie hopefully wont dent his career. The story was abysmal. It was too thread bare and had too many things that were trying to be part of the story. If the writer had used only the vampires it might have been ok.I have a belief that special effects should enhance a movie(like the lord of the Rings) but not overpower it. Money should have been saved on special effects to have a real writer do the story.The guy playing the vampire was awful. You think with the budget someone could have hired a real actor.Anyway if you must see this rent it.
1,Lamentable,"Who had the idea to make this movie? It's really bad. The actor playing Dracula is a bad actor, I can't believe he was playing Dracula. Frankenstein looks like a cyborg of B movie. If you have ever read Dracula of Bram Stoker -which is a great book-, Van Helsing is an old man, not a mix of Jedi, Men in Black, Spiderman, Batman, Indiana Jones and James Bond. This movie it's a joke of bad taste. Bela Lugosi, where are you?"
1,Worst movie ever,Are you kidding me? This is the biggest piece of crap since the hulk. They had the worst stories ever. It was the League of Extrodinary Gentlemen 2: Gigli. There was an order of [...] monks??? Frakenstein was runnin away from guys wit sticks???? I didn't see the rest becuz me n muh friend walked out 3 times. Twice to get the ppl we were wit.
3,Good Movie.,"Stephen Sommer's makes another Horror movie. Creatures like the wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstien are in this movie. Before ""The Mummy"" films, he had other movies out, but now he wants horror. This movie is a scary movie once in a while. The special effects are okay. But otherwise, it's just a good movie.Rated: PG-13 For Violence and Scary Stuff.Running Time: 130 Minutes"
3,This movie had such potential,What a waste that they could have such a cool actor and actress and stil make this movie suck!
5,All the monsters rolled into one movie,"Usually when movie makers try to have more than one classic monster, it ends up too corny. This was done beautifully. The old rules have not been challenged(i.e. silver bullets killing werewolves. holy water killing vampires) This makes so there is a bridge between the old and new generations. Funny, isn't it?"
2,cheesy rollercoaster ride,"Some of the effects were really great, while some seemed hurried and cheap. With that aside, it was a fun film if you leave your brain at the door. The character of Van Helsing himself was super cheesy. He is like a cross between Michael Douglas in ""Romancing The Stone"" and Indiana Jones. This is a movie that should be seen while on the big screen as it will lose half of its effectiveness on a TV screen. The brides of Dracula stole the show while the Dracula character himself was every stupid cliche of Dracula possible. 2 and 1/2 stars."
4,Well I really liked it. Fantastic ending!,"I just saw this with my 10 yr old boy. He really liked it. So did I. The special effects are very well done for all the characters and there are bits of humor sprinkled throughout the film.Although, the how and why of the story weren't really well developed this was a really fun and entertaining movie.The dracula character was the most likeable and charming villain I've seen in a film in a long time. And the Frankenstein monster came closest to the Mary Shelly novel than anything in film since the 1940s (Boris Karloff) Frankenstein movie. And yes, there are some spooky, creepy parts.If you liked Raiders of The Lost Ark or if you've read or seen A Boy and His Dog and loved the ending, then I think you'll like this film.I wouldn't pay to see most of todays Hollywood movies in the theater even once but I could probably be talked into going to the movies to see this one again.Well done! You'll love the ending, I promise."
3,Van Has Little Bite,"Wow! A movie that features Dracula, Wolfie, Frankie and Hyde. The Problem here is maybe the approach should have been like the ""Batman"" films, you know only 2 villains at a time. This film was a mess! Noisy, overloaded with special effects, a horrible script, and confusing direction are this films strong points. A good popcorn movie, maybe. Too violent for children, who may enjoy the film the most, and not violent enough for adults. This film was designed to be a blockbuster and nothing more. It's a flash in the pan and like Dracula, has no shadows. It's empty without any meaning or substance. Even Kate Beckinsale looks bored. Hugh Jackman looks happy, but he got paid very well. He needs to stick to Wolverine."
2,"Good effects, crazy story","Put together Frankestein, Dracula and some strange aliens, and you finally get a light, forgettable movie. And don`t watch it in family if your kids are under 10, they can get scared of the fast, annoying action."
1,Stephen Sommers should be kicked in the nuts!,"How do you take one of the hottest actresses alive, one of the best action heroes of our time, use the majority of Universal's awesome monsters, and still make a terrible movie?!! Stephen Sommers, that's how! I have NO idea why they still pay this guy to make movies! After this garbage they still let him direct G.I.Joe!!! I was SO excited to see this when it came out at theaters, but was SO let down when I did. The stunts in this movie are beyond ridiculous, and there are so many coincidences that the story just becomes laughable. I just watched this on television the other day, and felt the need to vent. If someone in Hollywoodland is paying attention, PLEASE DO NOT let that Stephen Sommers douche make anymore movies!"
2,This was a horror movie??????,I was really disappointed in this movie. The girl was the chick from Underworld so I thought it would be aweasome and since we was just human there was nothing special about here. The previews make the movie look better than it was. Althought the Wolfman and Dracula were aweasome. That is the best Wolfman I have seen in awhile it was even better than American Werewolf in London and Paris and I think thoes are two great werewolf films. Dracula was so cool and so sexy but the movie overall was not that great and really boring I almost fell asleep. The Frankenstien was pathetic.
3,"so much to like,and alot to loathe","acually not so much to like but what i did like carried alot of weight.the special effects were very good.the acting for the most part not stomache turning.the direction was adequate and i was convinced that the movie was taking place when/where it was portrayed to be.the pace was brisk and no obligitory love scenes...''death is right around the corner,but im sure we have time for a roll in the hay''....my major gripe is that once van helsing actually battles dracula,the fight isnt all that.some sillyness makes van helsing more powerfull than believable.which brings me to what i disliked.the story is utter nonsense.the premiss is old and reliable.story and premiss are not the same thing.you can have a good idea ruined by the story or the telling of.i would put this on the same entertainment level of league of extraordinary men.complete nonsense of a plot but good idea,good action.you can and probably already have bought worse.this is worth the $20 IMHO."
4,Not bad at all,"This movie was more than i expected. I read some of the reviews, most of them saying that Dracula sucked in the movie.I felt that too, but then i realized that he was ok. 3 werewolves for the price of 1, a gray one, a brown one, and the coolest, baddest, biggest werewolf i've seen,the black one, Van Helsing himself. And 3 hot looking vampire girls, they were all so beautiful, not to mention Kate Beckinsale, too bad she dies at the end. This movie was great, the music is amazing...why not say it...this is the closest i'll ever get to see a Castlevania movie. I hope they release a fullscreen version of it on dvd."
1,hhhhmmmmmm,"wow, please don't buy this movie its a complete waste of money and if i could i wouldent even give the movie 1 star. you will thank me for telling you not to buy this movie.If you want to invest your money wisely you will buy the new star wars DVD collection,or you can buy fifth element. your welcome in advance. and remeber Van Hellsing=bad waste of money."
2,News Flash !!! Holly wood bomb again!,This movie without a doubt could have been the best movie out of the year. Let talk about the story it like the same Hollywood movie I seen last week that drag the woman all thought movie but that killer on the end! Seen it hundred times if u going to keep her as a side kick please give some skill. My god who write this stuff! She fighting monsters.The reason I give it a 2 because without a doubt good special effect!!! My thing how can u turn this movie into a love story? Someone need to retire Hollywood soon!!!
1,Weak wait for it to come on TV,Hugh Jackman is not hard to look at but the movie is all computer generated what ever happened to real actors and real make-up men. If you really want to see a good vampire movie get the original Dracula with Bela or Bram Stokers Dracula with Hopkins I felt like I was watching a cartoon not a horror movie. Not a big fan of Mr. Jackman.
1,This is one of those....Zero star movies....,"Um. Dont see it if your smart. Both my friend, myself, and my mother hated it. We were about ready to leave not even half an hour into it. This show seems fit for the audience of people who dont know movies, or 7 yr old boys...into power-rangers and such.The womans VOICE ITSELF irratated me. Anyways, carry on and see the movie, because a ton of idiotic good reviews will inform you to see it...but I suggest using that money for a better use. Like buying a tampon to shove in ones nose!!!"
1,Ugh...,"I had great expectations for this film. I loved Deep Rising and both Mummy movies, am a devoted fan of the Universal Classic monsters, and think Hugh Jackman is a fine actor. Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed with Van Helsing. Sommers overloaded his film with entirely too much cartoony CGI, the acting was so overblown and melodramatic that any opportunity for decent characterization was rendered inert, the dialogue was ridiculous, and the main character failed at nearly everything he attempted. This Van Helsing was supposed to be a Victorian butt-kicker, but instead ended up as little more than a whipping boy, and that is where this film's greatest weakness lies. If you want to see Hugh Jackman portray a capable hero, then watch either of the X-Men movies instead. If you want monsters, then watch the original Universal Classics or the 50s Hammer films. If you want a cartoony CGI nightmare, then by all means, watch Van Helsing. F-"
2,Looks cool but is actually stupid,"This is one of those movies that is really easy to crack a LOT of jokes at because there is some seriously stupid stuff in it. 1. Kate Beckinsale's phony transylvanian accent was enough to drive anyone crazy. 2. Dracula is just so awkward. He makes you want to look down everytime he shows up. His lines are bogus. It sounds like he's going blah blah blah. BLAH. 3. Hugh Jackman is pretty boring. 4. Overall, too much cheesiness.GOOD STUFF IN THE MOVIE- Couple of cool action scenes. If you turned the volume off it would look cool and not anoy you. Nice crossbow rifle. I can't think of much else. ITS PROBABLY NOT WORTH IT TO SEE THIS MOVIE."
5,Oh my god,"This is truly the best lightning related movie ever, lighting happens at least 10 times a minute in Van Helsing land, a true lightning lover's dream come true. Oh yeah and what an amazing group of characters without a doubt the most chemistery to ever happen in movie history. And such a deep plot, watching it once just isn't enough. BUY THIS MOVIE NOW, DON'T RENT IT FIRST, JUST BUY IT, YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!!!!!"
1,The world's most plagerised movie,"Van HelsingWow, I really can't say enough bad things about this movie. It is roughly 75% plagerised from various flicks. I am not speaking of the amalgam of classic monsters, rather I am referring to direct and indirect quotes, effects, themes etc...of other popular movies. Such as Lara Croft, Star Wars, Star Trek, Krull, Shrek, Dune, The Matrix and I know I found more, but would have to watch it again to name them all, which I have no intention of doing. I purchased this movie, but will send it out free to anyone who wants it. I sure as (enter swear word of your choice) don't want this piece of garbage in my collection."
1,very over dramatic,"I laughed so hard at this lame attempt of a movie, my sides hurt at the end. The writting, was as if a cliche' marylin manson fan wrote it, and the visual effects [cgi] made it more cheesy. Was this suppose to be a serious movie?!? Or to just entertain the easily entertained. The acting from Hugh Jackman wasn't much of a streach from X-Men. Kate Beckinsale was casted into this movie, and she was a fish out water through-out the movie it was a waste of her actuall talent. Atleast Underworld was more serious than this piece of cr*p. This movie was made in hopes to try to flock the people who like eye candy. Blech, to you stephen somers, and to your mindless movie!!!"
1,"See UNDERWORLD again, instead, this is garbage.","I was very, very disappointed with this movie. It was just terrible. If you want to see a good vampire movie, just watch Underworld (again).What got to me was some of dialog... it was just so stupid at many points in the movie: ""I've never been to the sea. I bet it's beautiful."" Something like that, anyway, right in the middle of a hunt for the vampire. It didn't fit, it was stupid, it ruined the whole scene.And that idiot friar... he was a constant, not funny, joke.Very disappointed, to say the least..."
1,Couldn't wait for it to end,terrible.....boring.....painful to watch and just dragged on endlessly. The best part of this movie was when it was over. Forget this one..don't waste your money. Wait for it to show up in the bargain bin.
3,Worth a look.,"Even though it's wanna-be horror campiness and the ability to have lightning finish every important mission-stating sentence makes me want to vomit, it's still Hugh Jackman and it's still Kate Beckinsale. Jackman is someone worth watching even if it's 2 hours of him breathing as well as Beckinsale who is the most refreshing import we've seen these past few years."
2,Awful,"I heard about the negative reviews this movie had received, but I decided to give it a chance anyway. I regret it. I love the sci-fi/fantasy-action genre so, naturally, I figured this was my kind of movie. The character of 'Anna' is completely wasted. She has all these cool weapons but she never gets to use them. She's just there to be tossed around by the bad guys and to serve as the object of Van Helsing's lust. I thought Hollywood had moved past that, but apparently I was wrong. Van Helsing himself is completely uninteresting. He has ancient memories, he has past history with Dracula, he's the ""left hand of God"" - whatever. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of it. It didn't really have anything to do with the story anyway. The only good part was the character of Dracula. He was campishly(is that a word?) cool. But, all in all, it was a waste of my money. Now, Underworld, there was a good fantasy-action movie."
3,"Dissapointing, yet entertaining...","Butchered by the critics, Van Helsing is the latestaction/adventure from Stephen Summers (""The Mummy""). I truly loved The Mummy movies, so o'course i had to see Stephen Summers next movie. Van Helsing bosts of impressive CGI effects and awesome action sequences, and unfortantly a dull and boring storyline and characters without the right ""feeling"". The movie is to ""overdone"", and some of the classic monsters look rather dissapointing. Where the plot fails, the action scenes make up for it. This is the kind of movie you have to see for yourself, and not let reviews and critics make up your mind."
5,This monster-horror flick was...,"Van Helsing was a truelly excellent movie. Hugh Jackman portrayed van helsing in a very excellent manner. There were some surprising scenes, when monsters would lash out or something similar when it would take your breath away for a second. If you like vampire-monster movies, you need to add this to your movie collection!!!!!!!!"
1,truly awful,"Ok, I went into this knowing that the reviews were bad, but how bad could it be...it has Hugh Jackman and David Wenham, both great actors. Well, lets just say its really worse than the reviews say. It was the WORST movie I have ever seen, and I went to see Walking Tall a few weeks ago! very sad. David Wenham was the best thing in it, and he was basically a pathetic little geek. Kate Beckinsale is as bad as always, the accent should have tipped us off anyway. My recomendation is to avoid this one, and go see something more interesting. (...)"
2,Whoever greenlighted this movie should be shot,"This is one of the best examples of horribly terrifying acting I've ever seen. It is so ridiculous, I found myself making up my own dialogue to the story, which I enjoyed better. If you want a good party game, rent the movie. If not, try ""Underworld"" instead."
2,Disappointing,"This movie disappointed me. I was already anticipating a movie that was laden with special effects. I was anticipating insipid humor. I was still disappointed. Hollywood consistantly uses special effects to compensate for poor plot. This movie disappointed me considerably. I anticipated better acting, and an attempt on a plot. They didn't even try."
4,Not highbrow film....,"...but lots of fun. The movie was good, not awesome, but really a fun watch. They did jump the shark - without giving away the plot points, the bit where Van Helsing howls near the end.... yech.But anyway, for me, Dracula made the movie worth going to see for a second time. Campy - yes, dramatic - yes.... I'm not going to write a big long literary review of why the Dracula character worked the way it did because everyone has their opinions, suffice to say he got my thumbs up :)"
4,"oh, lighten up","first--if you're not willing to open skull and turn off brain at the door, then this movie's not for you. I liked the movie just fine. It wasn't on a par with The Mummy, but it was cheesy and fun to watch. As long as you're not going in there expecting Chariots of Fire or Gandhi, then you'll be fine."
2,"Love a Good Vampire Movie, But This is Not Good","Take every imaginable monster and throw it into the mix ... even this cannot save ""Van Helsing."" Frankenstein is an absolute joke, Dracula not nearly likeable or detestable enough, Igor and the townspeople's makeup questionable and the special affects a bit cheesy. Occasionally a redeeming quality, such as the werewolf transformation and the helpful friar, but certainly not enough to sustain a 2 hour movie. If you want good vampires, go elsewhere."
4,This is one of my favorite action movies ever!,"This movie was surprisingly entertaining!What I liked about the movie:1. The action was non-stop!2. All the actors nailed their characters!3. The visual effects were astonishing!4. The Dracula beast rocked!5. The werewolves looked very scary and imposing!6. Van Helsing used lots of cool weapons and methods to handle evil doers!7. The castles were great looking!8. Dracula's three brides were beautiful!9. The Frankenstein monster was cool!10. The movie was well thought-out and put together!What I didn't like was:1. The movie was a little too much like a video game!2. Sometimes the visual effect creatures looked cartoon-ish!Overall, I loved this movie more than The Mummy series! Watch if you are into action flicks!My grade A- or four and a half stars!"
4,Love this Movie!,"I totally love this movie. The special effects are amazing. It's one of my favorite vampire movies. It's a great movie to watch right around Halloween if you're like me and not really into full-on, gory, scare-the-poop-out0of-ya horror movies."
3,NOT BAD.,"Great special effects movie, but no story. Personally, I prefer more of the psychological vampire type stories, where the vampire gets into the head of his victims before attacking, but this is still an ok flick."
4,Not a deep thinking Movie,Don't take it serious and you will enjoy the special effects and the soundtrack.
1,How to ruin some classical horror stories.,"It is a hell of a challenge to find something positive about this movie. This is like James Bond taking on all the classical horror characters at the same time, Hollywood style! They even have an own Q preparing machine gun crossbows and other ""typical"" medieval weaponry. Children should not be allowed to watch this stupid movie as it definetely makes people lose braincells.(SARR)"
1,"Thin Plot, Over-Hyped special effects","Van Helsing, staring Hugh Jackman, has lots of potential. It's just a shame that it choses to ignore all that it has to offer in favor of CG gone wild.Van Helsing is the hunter of all of that is evil. Employed by the Vatican to rid the world of malicious and deviant creatures of the night and day, he is now faced with a menace that far exceeds anything he has ever faced...Dracula. Along the way, our hero meets a cast of characters. Some who are out to help him, and some who are trying to kill him.Hugh Jackman really helps to save this movie from being a pitiful dreg of film making. He always seems to have this humorous expression on his face, even when he is faced with great peril. Yet, not even the Aussie God can help this movie with what it lacks.A thin plot consisting of ridiculous twist and turns, and way too many CG effects. You would be better off renting this movie."
1,CRAP,"Stephen Sommers did it again: crap. He said he adapted the story of Dracula to our times? The story begins in Transylvania with Frankstein, and that's false, Frankstein was in Austria when he made the creature. An Van Helsing's name isn't Gabriel, is Abraham. Van Helsing isn't young, he's old. In the movie he looks like a mix of Spiderman, James Bond, Men in Black and Batman. In few words the movies is boring, has no plot and it's made with for people with a low I.Q..Save your money for a better movie and not in this CRAP of Stephen Sommers."
3,iI am sorry this movie sucks!!!!!!!! plain and simple.......,"THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!! BUT THE SPECIAL EFFECTS IS REALLY GREAT!!! ALL IN ALL I GUESS THAT IS WHAT SAVED THIS MOVIE Van Helsing was suppose to be a great action adventure and most fans thought that this was a prequel to Bram Strokers Dracula, i was so wrong and mistaken, what a misconception i had....... this really fool me into going and see this movie, I still like Hugh Jackman, i think most people went to see him apart form great acting talent ,his carisma also saved this mockery of Van Helsing this is not the story i wanted to see and DRACULA in this movie is pathetic!!!! who the hell wanted to see a ""mad psycho-sexual silivating moronic whining bitch"" as THE ORIGINAL DRACULA sad!!!!!!!!!! i hate this movie i wouldn't give it a star but Hugh Jackman and the special effect must worth something, maybe a kid would like this but not me laterzzzz folks............"
1,BADMOVIE,Bad bad movie. Really bad movie. A rape of the classic monster characters. Bad movie is also bad entertainment and that`s what this movie really is. Bad bad and once again really bad.
2,Yeah Right!!,What a silly waste of time!! I really tried to like this movie but was left with heartburn with the silly costumes and bad dialogue!! Not even worth the time it takes to put it into the DVD player!!
1,Don't ever rent it,"On paper I bet this looked great. You have interesting actors, and characters, great looking locations and a fun story line. But when all was said and done what ended up on film was just junk. With so much potential I cannot begin to figure out where they went wrong. But more disappointing was the CGI. Nothing ruins a film faster that people interacting with obviously fake villains. I reminded me of how the cartoons walked around with all the real live people in Roger Rabbit only worse."
1,Incredibly Bad,"Many years ago, I almost walked out on Kevin Costner's ""Wyatt Earp."" I really wanted to--a part of me wishes that I had--walked out on this stinker. Uninspired acting, poor plot, and sketchy special effects."
2,"really bad, I thought I was watching a video game...","I had high hopes for this movie, not that I expect much, juss wanna have some action good times ya know?? But it juss turned out to be absolutely HORRIBLE!First of all, I swear, if you go just watch the video game, it wouldn't be any different. The plot has no heartfelt storyline, no good acting, no convincing special effects for goodness sake, as much as I love Hugh Jackman, I rather see him in X-man than this just unbelievable bad movie.the action weren't great either, like I said the special effects were BAD, and the people action looked like those old people from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Bunch of chases, and other than that bunch of cheezy and at times grossed out (and not even the gore kind most people like, this time think Gremlines)cartoony flicks.And not even a happy ending to cheer me up at the end.that said, Underworld is a much better movie, at least that one felt more realistic and the characters are cooler."
2,Maybe for a 12 year old,"If there is substance in this film it is lost in action. The movie is one of those typical high budget summer hits, having the lifetime of 1 summer. Once you have seen it there is very little that makes you wan't to see it again and the movie does not make a worthy investment. The movie does have EVERYTHING, Dracula, werewolves, the Frankenstein monster, Mr. Hyde, Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Van Helsing and an odd friar for comic relief. But since it has everything there is little room for a good story, only short plot drivers to connect endless action scenes built around computer generated graphics. I probably would have enjoyed it better if I was 12."
1,0 STARS: Van Puke stinks,"The movie ""Van Puke"" a/k/a ""Van Helsing"" is a total joke and a total zero. This movie is not worth a review other than to say that this movie is utterly horrible and a disgrace to the horror movie genre. Thanks for reading."
2,TO MANY CGI EFFECTS,"The plot to this movie is wierd. Count Dracula has to obtain electrical life force from Frankenstien. All this to hatch a bunch of eggs to be his children. V.H. does every thing to stop him even turning into a werewolf himself. Its not a crappy movie just a weird plot which drags it down. There is also a sub-plot about V.H. and Drac. meeting before 400 years ago but Helsing has no memory of it. Wierd stuff like that, not fully explained."
1,A true horror of a movie,"Any movie going audience with half of Frankensteins brain would run screaming from the room if they were unfortunate enough to cast a glimpse of this trainwreck. This is a pure example of trying to use CGI to distract the viewer from noticing the complete lack of a tangible or entertaining storyline. If you're a filmographer studying computer imagery, this is a good film for research, otherwise it's sole value as a DVD is as a coaster for the drink you're going to need after watching it."
1,Boring and stupid; stupid and boring.,"Ohmigosh, this movie goes on forever. The writing is so very incredibly bad; one deus ex machina after another--the sort of writing you would hope someone would grow out of once they got out of 4th grade. Lots of noise, lots of really ugly CGI creatures, lots of attempts to sound savvy by referencing classic monster movies--also lots of cliched dialog and situations (and not used in a savvy way). None of it is the least bit interesting or makes the least bit of sense. It's just a total, utter, complete waste of time. Boredom in widescreen."
1,Buy the non-import version! This one bites (in price),"For those who rated this high because you bought the import version, well, you didn't wait long enough. As I expected, it is now being released in September by Universal Studios for much less than this import. For those who refused to buy this expensive import, you can now get a good region 1 version for much less!end-of-line"
1,simply horrible,"If you are thinking about buying this movie,don't!This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a really long time.The special effects are not that special and the acting by Dracula's brides is simply laughable.While Dracula himself could use a little charisma.The only redeemable thing about the whole movie is Kate Beckinsale and the few scenes of Hugh Jackman shirtless."
1,A Total Waste,"I have several older movies I sometimes plug into at night as a sleep aid , but this film won't even make it into my snoozer stash. It's too loud and intrusive to fall asleep on. An absolute waste. The one star is for Kate Beckinsale , she had the only fake accent that didn't grate on my last nerve. The special features promise a movie that must have been sent to an alternate universe. Why do I have a copy ? I got it for Christmas. I'm glad it tanked at the box office , a sequel is just too horrid to consider."
3,Fun & Great FX,"Really 3 1/2 stars.Forget that the name implies that this has anything to do with the classic Van Helsing/Dracula conflict. If you're looking for anything related to the classic tail then you should probably steer clear of this movie. Think more along the lines of 007. That's right. There's Van Helsing (aka 007) working for an organization out to save the world from ghouls and ghosts complete with M and Q equivalents and lots of ""state of the art"" equipment. The movie is not so much great for its subject matter or its acting. The movie is great for its special effects.Some of the criticisms are that they try and cram too many beasties in the film. After all you get werewolves, Dr. Jeckle & Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster, and of course Dracula and his three wives. Yes, the plot is thin trying to work all of these characters in, but like I said, it's a fun movie that a showcase for the FX folks. Enjoy it for what it is."
2,"Very disappointed, not what I expected","I saw the ads and read all the buzz about this movie so I thought it might be pretty good, I was disappointed. I wondered what was going on with the B/W intro, turns out that was a flashback- it looked about as good as any part of the movie. For the rest you get an odd mix of action, some humor bits (including the James Bondish weapons lab in the Vatican Cellars, and the friar who develops some of them), and a lot of visuals.I'd get this one for the extra's,(I'd love to see how they did all of that stuff),not the movie itself.Spend less than twice the money and get any season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you'll get better value."
2,DIGIPAK SHOULD BE OUTLAWED,"Love this movie or hate it.... The studios should stop throwing this Digipak packaging crap at us. When we are paying extra for the latest ""Special, Ultimate ,or Extreme Edition"" of a DVD, we should not have to deal with flimsy cardboard packaging that doesn't have any shelf life to it. WAKE-UP AND GIVE US KEEP CASES (There is a reason they call them ""Keep Cases"")PS the Movie only edition, comes in a Keep Case. Go Figure."
1,"Skip it, it's that bad.","I love Huge Jackman but other than his game performance, the movie is just a huge mess from beginning to end. The rest of the acting is horrendous and the story feels like a five-year-old wrote it on the fly. Special Effects don't make a movie and this is a prime example of it and a bad example on top of that. Even the Mummy movies were much better than this and that is because those movies had very good acting and a little thing called a plot. Something Van Helsing does not have.Avoid, you will thank yourself in the morning."
5,A fan of werewolves,"Special graphic effects were fantastic, this version of the werewolf was a sight to behold."
5,a out of this world adventure,"i have to say that van helsing was a great film. one, it had all the classic horror monsters in it and two, it had the legendary vampire hunter van helsing. what more could you ask. it had out of this world action, a few fright scenes, very smooth comedy, and to top it all of a all star cast of actors. our story begins one year earlier when the frankenstien monster is born (the opening is in black and white) then the next year we find helsing in france tracking down mr. hyde. then he is called to rome on a top mission. he must go to transylvania and stop count dracula from hacthing his children, his devilish brides and the wolf man. joined by his assistant carl, the transylvanian princess anna, and the frankenstien monster, to stop the counts evil plans. see the movie i gaurnatee you will put it in your dvd collection."
4,"Fun, mindless entertainment","I was pleasently surprised when I saw ""Van Helsing"" in the theaters. After reading all of the bad reviews (save for Roger Ebert, who loved it) I was a little worried that the movie was going to be as bad as everyone said it was. But instead, I was treated to a good summer-action flick with mindless action and lots of explosions. Why can't people just enjoy summer movies? Why do they have to criticize everything? I mean, come one, it's not going to win any Oscars so just enjoy this little piece of brain candy. The best part of the movie was Richard Roxburgh's Dracula. He was so cool! So rent or buy this movie and just have fun."
3,More amazed by the females,I was more interested with Anna and dracula's brides in the movie because they all were so beautiful. Dracula's brides really amazed me with their evil roles. I wasn't interested in the males because their roles were so boring and so weak. Van Helsing was okay.
3,FAIR,"Like some of the action but could be a little more, can't be really too hard on it because i have seen worst sugar coated hollywood films"
1,The greatest sin,is to be boring. When they swing from place to place what are the ropes attached to? The villain was not worthy of the effort. The movie not worthy of your time.
2,I'm shaking with LAUGHTER,"**spoilers below**I laughed out loud in the theatre when Kate Beckinsale died. It was so badly scripted and acted, and oohhhh so predictible.Two stars because Dracula's brides were the bomb...and that scene when the three of them descended upon the town was killer."
1,rubbish.....,"... simply put......... rubbish.The amount of Money spent on this film....... decadently sickening!The Script....... flawed, flat, numb.The Direction........ Lame!!!!!The actors....... tried hard to save it! but failed miserably!The Computer FX.......... beyond woeful! ....this stretchy, movement blur thing is ruining all the reality of film - give me practical fx anyday! ...you losers who enjoy this green screen fake reality - go play a COMPUTER GAME! Films were meant to be real - sets - locations - special effects = aimed to extend our perception of reality - not this lifeless, dull, gamer orientated rubbish which upon conclusion, really just ends up being disrespectful to the old horror masters they tried to impress!If someone aims to HOMAGE the classic HORROR films of the golden age of horror - for godsake don't sell out like these fakers....go buy the original classics and put this where it belongs.... the bin!"
2,So-so monster flick,"The idea of throwing all the 19th Century ""monsters"" (Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and werewolves) into one flick was done to better affect in the goofball Abbott & Costello movies. Making Van Helsing a renowned monster hunter backed by the Church and a team of brilliant gadget makers is corny. If you want to get to know Van Helsing, read Bram Stoker's Dracula.Van Helsing has beautiful women and great special effects. The action is attention-grabbing at times. But neither are enough to make this a good film. There are some fun bits but the movie's definitely not worth the purchase price and maybe not even worth the rental price."
2,Not that good of a movie.,"This movie was OK, but not very good. There are too many special effects in this movie, and they take away the movie's realness. The script is campy with some of the stupidest lines i've ever heard in a Dracula movie, and the acting is laughably bad. Hugh Jackman should've ditched this movie, and the same for Kate Beckinsale. If you want to see a better film, go see Francis Ford Coppolas version of Dracula over this crap."
3,about average,"Van Helsing is a movie that is about average. The plot to the movie is nothing special. I think it was a cross between enjoyable and cheesy. I would also like to say that I saw this on the big screen and it was much better there.There is action in this movie, but at times it is simply boring. Also, it is very hard to 'get lost' and not understand what is happening. The movie relies heavily on special effects, and those special effects are nothing special.Overall, this was an enjoyable movie, but I would recommend simply renting it over purchasing"
2,Not the best,I am a huge vampire fan but this movie was a huge disapointment. When i saw this movie @ walmart i thought wow all my favorite horror monsters in one movie. And when i saw it i laughed. The only good part is the werewolves because they were the only thing that wasnt retared (vampires) or over dramatic (frankinstine). Kate beckinsale was good in this but if you want a good werewolf vampire movie get Kate's other vampire movie Underworld were she plays a vampire it is a great movie!!!!!!
1,This movie was balls.. Zero Stars!,"Did Universal do this? I forget. I cannot believe that they would allow their classic monsters to be turned into NEWSPAPER for the giant pet-store parrot ""Van Helsing"". What a joke. The only good thing this movie did was spark the re-release of the original Universal presentations of Dracula, Wolf-Man, and Frankenstein which were previously un-available for about 2 years or so. This movie is suck. Don't waste the cash. Skip it. How many more ways can I say it?! This movie was balls! ZERO STARS!"
1,Van Helstupid,"Movies like this make me believe that Hollywood execs smoke pot while brain storming. Do we really need another Dacula movie? Not to mention one with a really cheezy sript that makes his path cross with that of Mr. Hide, Frankenstine , and some goofy order of monks? No we do not. It must have been 4:20. I am sure that Stoker, Shelly, and Robert Lewis Stephevenson had this movie in mind when they created there clasic charecters. NOT! I am a big fan Hugh Jackman and a HUGE fan of Kake Beckinsale, but this movie sucks! Who the hell is Van Helsing? He is just this randon charecter that kills monsters, and killed Dacula in a past life. He is sent to Transalvania to kill Dacula and save Anna's (Backinsale) family from pergatory. This flim is trash, it's waste, it's disposible, it's production is an insult to filmmakeing. Kake's body is the only reson anyone should go see it."
2,Proof that hype and special effects won't make a good movie,"This movie could have been great. The combination of old-school monsters with the incredible special effects held much promise. However, towards the end of the movie, approaching what should be the climax, I found myself nodding off...over, and over again. Make no mistake, I wasn't tired, just tired of this movie. I suppose it was how every fight was designed the EXACT same way (Hugh Jackman gets hit hard, gets up, proceeds to stomp villian arse, repeat), or the absence of those elements vital to a good movie, such as plot and cohesion of said plot, but by the end of this movie, I was just plain bored. Find it as a rental if you must see it, but be prepared to be disappointed; I wish I had been, I would have brought a pillow."
3,Dracula Update,This is a kind of original retelling of the Dracula legend with Hugh Jackman of X Men fame in the title role as Van Helsing. It is set in 1887 Transylvania. It was a decent effort. There was a lot of creature violence throughout the film.
2,I liked the cow,"Take every ridiculous Dracula-vampire-Transylvania stereotype you can find, spice it with some special effects and...voila, out comes ""Van Helsing"".I think you need a special kind of humour to really appreciate vampire slayer Van Helsing's hunt for Count Dracula, Mr. Hyde and the odd werewolf. He turns out to be on a first name basis with Frankenstein's monster and a mysterious order of Catholic knights. And yes, ""Van Helsing"" suffers from an obvious LOTR-Excalibur complex.I liked the cow, though.Two stars."
1,van helsing,1 star is generous..save your money.......this genere of film does need a certain atmosphere but van helsing is so dark that 90 per cent of the film is un-viewwable.....acting?.frankenstein was ok.
1,what??????,"this movie sounds good....but......UHHHHHHH......just to tell you its just plian stupid.it has ACTION??????it has DRAMA!!!!!!dracula looks weird,and the actors are pretty good........NOT!!!!!!!everything was horribale!!!!!!!!!!everything is STUPID!!!!!!!!!i got the dvd and it was just a waste of money,dude!!!!!!when i wacthed it i got all exitied!!!!!then..............my jaws went OPEN!!!!!i kept going to the restroom;and i barely slept!!!!!!!!!! plaese amazon poeple make this 3 stars!!!!!PLEASE!!!!!!!!so theres olney ONE word yo describe this horriballe movie:SYUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i hope that your not going to wacth this dvd/movie!!!!!!!!!!!!i hope so!!!!"
2,Sorry Waste of Film,"I was pumped up for this film when I first saw the trailer. First off, how can you go wrong with Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman. Plus, Hugh Jackmen is awesome.I think the major reason the film failed on so many levels is Stephen Sommers. I can't stand any of his other films and after the first ten minutes, which up til then it was filmed quite nice and had a great feel to it, it's a total waste of film. Sorry, this is one of the worst films of the year. Save your money and cash. If you have to see it, rent it....for cheap, cheap, cheap."
3,Van Helsing,"Ok, so THE MUMMY was fun, and MUMMY RETURNS was intermittingly enjoyable despite some obvious flaws, and VAN HELSING looked set to be an impressive CGI-fest with heaps of fast-paced action and Saturday night popcorn fun.It delivers on its promise for action, there are some great set-pieces and the special effects are great, but the cold hard fast is that Stephen Sommers isn't a very good director. Like Jan DeBont and McG, Sommers is one of those types that likes to throw in as much visuals as humanly possible and BAM! A great movie. Problem is, it doesn't always work. Richard Roxburgh's bad-accented Count Dracula is overly-camp, and while Hugh Jackman is seemingly doing something different, he's really just redoing his Wolverine shtick: Shady guy who dispenses ample amounts of violence and one-liners along with obligatory memory problems. Overall, not bad, just not very good either. Next time Mr. Sommers, can we have a bit more story please?"
1,There is only one word to describe this...,Crap. I saw the movie last night and it was crap. I had wanted to see it for a while and I was very disappointed. The special effects were the only thing good about this movie. I'm just glad that I didn't have to pay to see this.
1,Pure Crap The Creater Should Have Been Sewed,This is the worst movie i have ever seen to much CGI witch recks the whole film and then creator screws around with all the classic monsters. The acting and fight scenes are awful. From the beginning of the film the use material fom other movies.Like Batman Disneys Version of The Three Muskateers Blade and about ten more movies. stupid rip off
3,Average,"It was just OK. There was nothing drawing me in to the plot or making me care about the characters. It has been done at a low light level (on pupose, I am sure) that keeps the tones and colors muted to the point of boredom. It seemed to me to be a movie that was produced to help kick off a series of sequels. If there are sequels, I won't worry about seeing them."
3,Fun,"It definitely had some campy/cheesy drama to it.example: ""Noooooooooooooo!"" (seriously)I say it was a fun movie minus the campy drama.And I liked Van Helsing himself but that's because he had the least campy drama in him.So if you like mindless fun and don't mind things being cheesy, then go for it."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to opening day. What a let down. The performances were flat and uninspired. Absolutely no chemistry between Jackman and Beckinsale. The film was derivitive, corny, and boring."
4,Scarry and some what funny movie,"some people will find this movie really scary, some might find it really funny. If you like monsters and creepy stuff, you will enjoy this movie. If you don't like creepy monsters and draculas with huge teeth, please try to avoid movies like this one."
2,uhhhh...no,"Is it just me or were the special effects kinda cartoonish? Was the overall plot kinda lame and the whole premise kinda, oh I don't know, stupid. Is it just me or is Hugh Jackman really overrated...Ok forget that comment because when he dons six atamantiam claws and bad hair he kicks major @$$ as Wolverine...but here he just comes across as lame. I really had high hopes for this film...Coming off the high that was Underworld I was syked to see another monster mash but this film left me feeling a little irritated. I just really did not like it, and maybe I'm wrong, but this film seems to be one of those love it or hate it type films and I guess I fall into the hated it catagory. Now Underworld is a monster movie with bite..this was just a monster movie with bad acting and horrid special effects. Don't waste your time."
1,Almost a complete waste of time,"If the movie had not started out like ""Young Frankenstein"", perhaps I could have taken it more seriously. But as it was, I expected Mel Brooks to jump out any minute. Could Mr. Hyde have been any more like Shreck, or the Frankenstein monster like its tap-dancing mimic? Another reviewer here mentioned comparisons to ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and I couldn't agree more except to say that ""League"" was far, far better. The poor chump Van Helsing didn't even get the girl!!Trying to be serious, it even fails at comedy--like the monster rowing out to sea at the end--that was supposed to be dramatic?? More than I laughed out loud at that one.The one star was for the truly spectacular special effects. The rest of it wasn't worth the price of admission."
3,"Wonderfully Wry, Great Digital Graphics","C'mon, folks! If you've come to find a darkly sinister and very scary movie .. this probably isn't the one! However, if you just want to be entertained and are looking for a couple of hours' worth of spiking your imagination, this one's worth a watch. I understand that it's not going to rival the fore-runners in this field, but it has a completely different way of looking at some of the better-known ghouls of past generations and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There's some very interesting use of digital graphics and you won't want to miss how Stephen Sommers has adapted such things into a scary/funny story line. It most assuredly doesn't adhere to the normal(?) way of thinking about vampires, monsters and all sorts of flying things, so go into it with an open mind and ... enjoy!"
4,Great film to have a good time,"Van Helsing is original, thrilling, entertaining. Then, why only 4 stars? I'd award the fifth to it if it were not because it did go over the limit of the fantastically tolerable in several occasions. It is a fantastic film, very original and it will keep your attention on the screen for the entire ~2:20 hours. Be warned though, it is a movie of fantastic beings and actions, but a very well developed one, with excellent special effects, beautiful sceneries and very good acting. Jackman as Van Helsing delivers a powerful performance, and though his character does not demand great dialogues, his presence is enough to give life to this evil-hunter. If Universal had made it a bit more down-to-earth, it would have been perfect. Yet, almost perfect is good enough :)"
1,movie without a brain,"If we graded JUST for special effects, this would be a 5, but thats ALL this film is! story line?, doesn't exist, stupid dialog?, got all you want. I wanted to like this film because it wore me out just watching it, but the question in my mind at the end, why was this made? totally empty of any reason. Great eye candy, but that's ALL. BEWARE!"
1,Van Helsing,"This movie was so incredibly bad. Vampires giving birth? But their babies are dead? The hell? The overacting was only overshadowed by the overuse of digital effects. BAD digital effects at that. But hey, at least they tried to make up for it being bad by making it really long! Had it been your typical 90 minute movie, it would've been laughable and fun in its suckiness, but at over 2 full hours of suck it just got old and left me wanting a pistol to put myself out of the misery that is Van Helsing. On the up-side, Kate Beckinsale was hot and was able to keep her performance steady through the whole movie.Oh, and I heard that watching this film can cause ass-cancer... so... you might want to skip it."
1,"Horrible, more Hollywood crap",I can't waste my time typing anything about this garbage. Don't buy it.
1,Absolute piece of crap,"Stephen Sommers has quickly proven himself to be a hack director with zero talent and zero respect for his subject matter, or his audience for that matter. I cannot recall a film as bad and as offensive as this since the last Star Wars film. I'm a huge horror and fantasy film fan, but this movie had nothing. Once again, as has become the norm for films in this genre today, an over dependance on CGI effects in lieu of a good script. Nothing like human beings bouncing off stone walls like rubber balls or flying through the air to sustain belief. Hugh Jackman must have been high on goofballs when he read this script. 2 hours of uninspired, unemotional dreck. A true insult to the films it supposedly pays tribute to, and proof positive that $148 million, cheezy computer effects, or wooden acting does not guarantee entertainment.Somebody put Sommers down like a wounded horse, please!"
1,"Worst movie of 2004, even worser than Catwoman.","This has got to be one of the most horrible and stupidest movies ever made. Nothing here impressed me , not even the special effects, because there was too many of them, which made the movie boring. The acting and dialogue feel like they were written, and acted out by a third grader. I'm glad that this movie tanked at the box office with 120 million, and hope that there will never be a Van Helsing 2, or else that will be the last day that hollywood knows what it's doing."
4,Pretty good for what it is,Vampire chicks are vicious. Van Helsing is James Bond. Werewolves are scary. Eastern Europian accents are annoying. Kate Beckinsale is annoying. I actually liked obviously fake special effects :DHere is the deal: have zero expectations and you will not be disappointed. Worth a rental price
4,interesting images,"I know most reviews pan this as one of the worst movies ever. But I kinda liked it!I found this movie interesting because of the visual images (and the character of Van Helsing is interesting, too). Yes, there is plenty of silliness (women in distress with perfect hair, etc. etc. etc.), but I still found much to enjoy.NOT for those who take their movies seriously, or who want an artistic film with terrific writing. Also not for the person who likes super-scary, super-gorey movies (this one is still too scary for kids)-- this movie can't decide if it is a comedy of a monster movie. But if you are looking for some silly monster fun, this movie may deliver for you.added 8/09: Fans of illustrator/writer Brom might be interested to know he worked on this film!"
3,A classical monster reunion,"All the greats, Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolve, even Jecke & Hyde make an appearance in this film. The movie is dark and sometimes the plot seems a little thing, or the director introduced something but never returned to it. The movie is good basic entertainment, if you are looking for a high-grade movie or classic, you should probably look elsewhere. This was great for entertainment, but I didn't add it to my library."
3,"Good, depending on your expectations","If you're looking for a film in the classic school of vampire horror, pass this one by - you won't like it.If you're looking for lots of mindless action, great CGI, and witty banter - this is one flick you're going to like.The characters are two-dimensional, the dialogue is witty and quick. The monsters are basic and hackneyed - but fun, with great special effects and excellent casting. The story is absurd, with nods to (or theft from, depending on your point of view) many of the classics - we've got Mr. Hyde as depicted by somone who read Hulk comics rather than the story, Van Helsing as an action hero with nifty gadgets rather than the traditional old and wise man who outthinks Dracula, and plenty of monsters from the classics of the 40s and 50s, remade to fit as many of them in as possible with great effects and little relevance to the story.Mindless action fun - but sometimes, mindless action fun is just that - fun."
4,Underrated Film,"A most enjoyable film. Just suspend your preconceived notions about who Van Helsing is based on the old, old movies and let yourself be transported into the world of the ""new"" Van Helsing. It's populated with new creatures, new ideas, great special effects and is just plain Gothic fun."
4,Kichler vanity light,Purchased for a bath remodel. Nice bright light. Looks very modern and have received lots of compliments. The chrome is more matte than expected. But overall very pretty.
5,An absolutely amazing book.....,"Weaving together many different disciplines, observations, and historical facts, Odom carefully constructs his thesis - which basically proves how the three elements making up the title are related and flow from one another. What is of great interest is that this area is grossly neglected, other than the occasional ""feel good"" books that are paraded around the TV talk shows, or the hypnotic productions from the academic mills.Be aware, however, that Odom pulls no punches, and is refreshingly clear in the light of political correctness. I will not give away the full gist of his argument, but strongly encourage anyone who considers themselves literate and educated to read this book. Ideally, the topics within the book could become the enlightened basis for the development not only of the family but of democracy as well."
4,the modish militia,"Sketch Book 76 is a concise, clearly illustrated manual of uniforms and accoutrements used by the American soldier of the Revolutionary War. Complete with patterns and instructions for making repro clothing, this is a valuable resource for re-enactors, and others with an interest in the history of dress in early America."
5,Great Quality - Highly Recommend,Love the vest and the seller let me change color after I ordered with no hassle at all. I bought the XL which is usally roomy on me and the vest fit just perfectly when buttoned so the sizing is on the tight side.
3,There's better,"I didn't like this book. Yes, it has lots of info. But I don't like to presentation. The two authors each provide their own commentary on each topic throughout the book. You first read Colin's outdated discussion on a given topic, then you get Chip's viewpoint. The authors clearly have extensive experience with all versions of equipment. But they fall short in making a simple recommendation. For example, the discussion on rain gear describes the various options and materials, but then doesn't conclude with a ""And I use one this because..."". The book is very wordy, and I found myself skimming over all the blah, blah, blah, in hopes of finding something useful. In the same purchase, I bought ""Lightweight Backpacking and Camping"", by Ryan Jordan, which I highly recommend."
3,I am in a coffee shop...,"I feel like I am in a local Portland coffee shop listening to two guys go back and forth about what they like and don't like, with not much sense to what they are trying to do. There are much better books out there and you may find this one confusing. If you can sift through the banter, there are some nuggets of gold, if you have several spare hours and a note pad when you read the book."
3,No Kindle edition?,"Exceptional ""guide book"" but only 3 stars...SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY!! Why would I want to carry around ONE BOOK when I can pack in the equivalence of 500 in half the weight of this one edition PB/HB !!!"
2,Very little use to me,"I brought this book in the hopes it would tell me about walking. I was very disappointed that it appears to simply be a gear guide. If you are into that good, but it's not all that useful for someone like me. A sleeping bag is a sleeping bag I don't need 20 pages tell me about them.I also expected a little more that just gear information. Obviously this is something you need to take into account but it's not everything. I would perhaps have called this book the complete gear guide but it is certainly not the complete walker. The index also leaves much to be desired."
5,Terrific read.,"Definitely worth to buy. Like a bible of hiking - i have a lot of experience, and still reread this. It could use an update probably around 2012-2013. Good value."
4,Haven't tried it,"Bought as a backup collar...haven't had a need to use it yet, but it matches the description, so no complaints here!"
5,wonderful book,"I am fascinated by all things blacklist, and this book, recommended to me by the late Christopher Trumbo, is wonderful and essential reading for any student of this rich period in American history. It is thorough, balanced, smart, and vivid. Having been born to parents who fled to Mexico, the author has a unique POV, which separates her book from so many of the others written on the subject. And what could be more affirmative and hopeful than the fact that she lives in Mexico still, having made a life for herself in the country of her parents' exile?"
2,Not very good,"We are using this book for a Masters level graduate course in Experimental Design. The book is poorly written. It seems like it is basically a compilation of lecture notes. I would use Montgomery over this text. Even our professor admits that it is useless to study from.The plus points are that it covers certain things that other text books don't (Error Rates, SNK, etc.). These are only covered minimally, though, and don't make up for the poor coverage of most of the other subjects in the book."
1,Watch out for the processing time on this order!,So you may not notice it says under the book title: usually ships between 1-3 weeks! I still haven't received my copy (almost a month). So if your in a hurry like most graduate students: don't buy the book here.
1,Worst book I have ever read,"Period. The author may be good in this field or research, but he definitely needs to improve his english language-Is he a native english speaker? Long long sentence, awkward structure, poorly chose words only leave reader in confusion."
1,Flood danger,"I've had this faucet for a year and a half and I liked it so much that I bought second one for my basement sink. But this week, as I was using it, I heard a clunk and hot water came spewing out. It was so hot and coming out so fast that I couldn't turn off the water under the sink, I had to shut the water off from the main line. When I removed the faucet, I noticed that one of the hoses just popped off the main faucet head causing the water to come out full force from the main line. Other faucets of this type have all the hoses screwed-in to the main head to avoid this problem. This faucet has 3 screwed-on hoses and one hose just pushed on. I had to replace this faucet and now I'm thinking of replacing the one in the basement as well because this could happen even when not using the faucet. I called the company to complain and they told me to return it where I bought it."
4,Good but not fabulous,"There are many reviews for this book. I'm a new Grace Kelly fan and this is the first book that I've read about her. Although it was good, it left me wanting so much more.There are many excerpts from previous books and authors (which I noted, and am now looking for those books to read). I would start with other books and end with this one. Others who knew her (Gwen Robyns and Robert Lacey) interest me more, as they actually knew her, and this book compiles those books and interviews with others into a new book. Good book, very addictive."
2,Slow,I love true historical biographies however I found thi very slow moving and boring. Was hard to get into. I just didn't feel that drive to keep picking it up.
3,Photos?,"This was a good book, but it didn't knock my socks off. One problem I'm having- there were no photos on my Kindle version? I kept waiting to get to them, but they never showed. If anyone could tell me the location on their Kindle version, I would be very appreciative. Hoping I just somehow missed them. Happy Reading!"
1,Trivial stuff--DON'T BOTHER WITH THE BOOK,"This was just a regirgitation of all the other drivel written about her. Author should be ashamed to take his royalty check! We all know the little stories-heck, we could have dug them up online! Not much depth here. He makes veiled comments about Kelly and her life, but only goes so far. VERY DISAPPOINTING"
1,Not Again!,"This book is rather long (nearly 500 pages) and recently published (2003) so one has every right to expect some new information or insights on the colourful history of the Grimaldi family. Regrettably, there is none. Mr. Taraborelli retells the same story of the ""fairy tale gone wrong"" that has been related in countless other books and magazines that have appeared in the decades following the death of Grace de Monaco. Further, the author's plodding, amateurish and hackneyed style, not to mention numerous factual errors, make the task of searching for revelations a tedious one indeed. A boorish waste of time."
5,This book is better than 3.5 stars.,"This book gets 5 stars for research, 5 stars for presentation (simply a photo of Grace in THAT wedding dress justifies a book existing) and 4 stars for a good read; It's not that it could have been any better, it's just that the story is ultimately sad. However, I think the subject matter was taken very seriously by the author, and unlike other reviewers here, I consider the thoughts expressed to be well thought out and supported by the material that was uncovered in the process, including that from interviews. What other material is ever likely to be uncovered on this subject?? This book is better than 3.5 stars."
5,princess grace,anyone interested in the life of grace kelly or the principalityof monaco should definitely read this book.the author goes in depth about the joys and sorrows of her(the princess') life to the point that it makes the reader feellike you personally knew her;a very emotional book to read.the small independent state of monaco came rather close to losing its sovereignty to francebut thanks to the story in this book it maintains its unique identity in todays modern world.
5,Too Much Monket Business,"My 3 and 4 year-olds love this book. The rhymes are very good (not your standard rhymes), the pictures are hysterical and the author manages to sneak in a counting exercise. Some books you get tired of reading but not this one. Finally, the lessons about safety (a not so subtle subtext) are not preachy but funny and to the point. You can't go wrong with this one."
2,Other choices are more effective and of better value,"I'm a big fan of pre-shave oils because they really do help my shave, probably more than any other product. The first pre-shave oil I tried was Art of Shaving, which was great. I like to try different products just to see if one might be better than the other or of better value if they work just the same. The Zirh Prepare is no longer in the running.It works just ok, when compared to the Art of Shaving pre-shave oil and the Anthony Logistics pre-shave oil. The others do a better job of softening my facial hair. Also, the others come in 2 ounce bottles. When you do the math, the Zirh Prepare costs $16 per ounce, while the Art of Shaving is $11 and Anthony Logistics $9 per ounce.It's a no brainer. Take Zirh's PREPARE off your list."
1,Disappointing at best,This import set has mostly remade re-recorded songs that were supposed to be the origional sound. It is NOT origional!!! Only a few contain the origional sound. The price is the only thing good in it's favor. It was cheap. I sent it back for a refund over three weeks ago. Hopefully I get it.
2,Save Your Money,Not worth the price of the view... not very informative about the clubs history and other than just a good time for a weekend didnt show anything worth while... nothing about the clubs mission or anything.
5,A Resource to point you where to go,"In one volume a myriad of other sources are referenced, state by state, county by county. This is a book that can tell you where to go to find historical genealogical records. Since that varies state to state and county to county, it is a great help to know what is available, where it is available, and how to make the contact. Well worth the price!!"
4,Excellent Single Reference for Genealogists,"Most of the information contained in this book could be collected by searching the Internet but why spend time figuring out the correct URL or making long distance calls when the information you are looking for is contained in a single desktop reference?Information covers all 50 states in the U.S. Quickly locate county seats, location of records by type, tips on requesting copies and visiting repositories, noteable quirks in regional documentation and what information may be missing because of damage or fire.The latest edition was printed in 2004, old by Internet standards. Fortunately historical records don't move around frequently. I wouldn't count on every URL, address or phone number listed to be complete or accurate at this point in time but it is a good starting point.Comparable to and less expensive than Ancestry's Red Book. A good resource for any serious hobbiest."
3,Recomended only for pessimist,I have read a couple of Mr Browne's books and come to the conclusion that he is very pessimist. Read this book only if you are want to be a short sellist specialist.
1,Buyer beware,"It comes with only the barest of instructions, no real software to speak of, and I can't get it to function as promised. I've tried it in a palm and in a pocket pc. I can't load the software on the palm, and the pocket pc software loads, but it won't recongnize the scanner when you open the software. So now I have a nifty paperweight on my desk with an embedded laser. Even if I could get it to work, it doesn't lock in real well so every time you push the button to scan it threatens to pop out. I wish I had look into this closer before purchasing."
5,Perfect!,"Item arrived quickly and was just as described. Using instructions on You Tube, I was able to install the memory in less than a minute, even though I have no tech skill whatsoever."
4,Memory,"Decent piece of hardware, easily installed into the computer. Price appears to have dropped since I purchased, so it's not a bad deal. Computer seems to work a little more seemless with the upgrade. Only time will tell on its manufactured quality, seems reliable hopefully I'm right."
5,Very satisfied with this RAM!,My 1997 Toshiba Windows Vista Laptop came with 1 Gig of Ram (2 x 512MB). Installing a pair of these Corsair 1GB Ram has vastly improved my computers performance.
5,very fast ram for a dell i9300,i had 512mb on my dell. 2 sticks of these and the system flys. the service i received was very fast and reliable. I would do business again with them in the future.
4,Increased laptop memory,Need to have better instructions for installing. Computer does not recognize the memory increase.Gary Neubauer
1,Not for Compaq,"I purchased this for my Compaq computer. The key notch is different, so the memory does not fit. ANTonline ignored my emails until 30 days ran, then refused to exchange it. Complained to Amazon, who said tough. So will send the next 10 times ($350) of business elsewhere before I will use Amazon again."
1,Cheap and fragile,"I thought I found the perfect gift for my mother for my wedding. However, they lasted one day and fell apart. I was so disappointed and embarrassed that this happened. Though pretty to look at, that is all they are good for."
3,Misty Mundae,Now I'm a big fan of Misty Mundae but I can safetly say that I've seen better performances come out of her movies. Maybe it is because its all soft core porn. But I have to say that if you want sex and all sex in this movie your in luck but if your like me and want some kind of plot line no matter how tiny I wouldn't reccomend it.
3,Pleasure to watch...,"You don't watch a Seduction Cinema movie for it's direction, filming or storyline, you watch them for beautiful naked girls, playing with themselves or with each others..and this is no exception...2 features on 2 sided DVD with many bonus features. The first one 45 minutes features the beautifull Misty...slow paced, quiet and hardly any dialoge, you feel you're sitting in the same room and just enjoy watching..More kissing and playing in the second 1 hour feature, beautifull bodies...For that price, it's well worth it..really a pleasure to watch these girsl..."
5,You have to experience the excitement of this Book,"From the beginning to the end this book will keep you on the edge of your seat. This book, just like the previous novels will make it hard to put down. The anti-christ continues his deception and cruelty behind closed doors. His assistants help him and the Christian players continue to carry out their plans to expose him and his cohorts. You must read this whole series to get the full impact of the future we all will surely face."
1,Not buy again,The size of these were not specified. They are for night light size bulbs. I was wanting one for regular size bulbs. Would not buy again without more and better information.
2,eh was ok,"I thought this was a true story but based on others reviews it seems as though its not. So, that kind of changes things as far as the story goes.This movie was okay, nothing profound, nothing real philosphical, I didnt really take much from it. Eventually it got to the point where it was just taking this guy in the story too long to die.I wanted him to die just so the movie would end. Everytime I thought he was dead, the narration would start again. Wouldnt watch it again."
3,Can't seem to get it to work on Win Xp...,"I'm sure this is a fun game, but never could get it to work on window xp. When I did the fps were really low. I know it's a old game anyways, just thought I would see if it would run on windows xp."
4,Mystery/thriller lovers,David Morrell knows how to keep his readers on edge- fast moving with lots of action - well developed characters - always choose D Morrell for a great read
3,The standard has dropped on this one.,"The plot is not has innovative as the earlier books that I have read. It becomes more of a fantasy / SCI FI novel at some stages, especially with the changes in the main protagonist"
4,A Lightning Fast Read,"This book is typical Morrell: A lone-wolf hero, pursued by government and criminal types alike. Cavanaugh is the hero, working for an organization that provides protection for individuals who want to disappear for whatever reason (except criminal types). After being double-crossed by a client, costing him co-workers, he sets out for revenge, involving his wife, who to this point was uninvolved in his work. Is it predictable? Yes. Is it entertaining and informative? Yes, again."
3,too much hype,"The action just went overboard on this book. Too much high tech gadgetry which I didn't expect on a Morrell book. I missed the old plots where history and quick wit was the key of telling a good story. However, if you want action...you surely have it in this book!"
4,Not Bad!,"Once again, Mr Morrell has thoroughly entertainmented me. If you're interested in a fast paced novel with lots of action, you'll find it here. Some of the scenarios seemed implausible, but entertaining nonetheless. I found myself saying ""no way"" several times, but I still couldn't put it down. Overall, an enjoyable read that's good to the last page."
1,Skip It,"David Morrell built a name for himself with novels like Brotherhood of the Rose, one of my all time favorites. This is not in the same league. As I started reading The Protector, it seemed vaguely familiar. After a while, I realized that I had tried to read it in the past and put it down. Now that I've spent money though, I guess I will finish it."
3,Morrell's Worst Book!,"I have read absolutely everything that Morrell has put out, and without a doubt this is his worst book.However, if you pick up a copy and read it, not having read Morrell before, this is a pretty decent book.This is the only one of his books, where I've been able to predict what's going to happen next, a few times throughout the book."
2,Not the best from a fine author.,"I found this book to be slow moving and somewhat boring. Morrell is a great author, but he seemed lost in this work. He didn't develop the background of Cavanuagh(the main character) or his company nearly enough. Not only that, but the dialogue seemed stilted and cobbled together.His other works are much much better."
5,best book ever,"this book is awesome, i've read a few other David Morrell books and this is my favorite. People maysay they can predict what happens next but they're lying. They never would have guessed the fear hormone or anything. A great plot and i think should be made into a movie to any of you directors out they which would be none of you. But this has heart pounding action and i could hardly bear putting it down and hoped it would go on forever. YOu some how connect with it realistic action. No exploding cars or usless shooting. A real page turner."
3,Good solid action tale,"The author takes the time to get the action right. No movie car chases or explosions, his are what would really happen, if your gas tank exploded. An enjoyable adventure read."
3,The 60's and The 70's Party Time Trivia DVD Game,"Good for testing your memory, learning what you may not have known or for correcting what you thought you may have known. Great for family gatherings, parties, etc. Multiple choice answers. It moved a little too slow for us at times, but the speed is great for a group of participants. Simple to use and clear to read. I would recommend it."
2,Poorly remastered !!!,"I love this band but who remastered these tracks? The drums and vocals are loud and clear, but not the guitars. It's like they forgot to remaster the leads because they sound really weak. I have 5 Hip cd's that aren't remastered and the guitars sound much stronger, as opposed to the remastered songs on this release. If you like to hear powerful guitar riffs like I do, then think twice about buying this one. At least until they go back and remaster it........again."
3,Nice secondary computer,"This computer is serving well as the ""second-string"" computer at our house. It's not as fast as some, but that is not a concern for us."
4,Had mine for two years and running!,"I've had my compaq for over two years now. Upgraded the graphics card to a geforce 9600gt and i can play most games on medium to high settings.Pretty zippy little computer, and with a beefier graphics card in it, it can really perform quite well. My only problem is that it only has two RAM slots, so upgrading the memory can be a bit of a problem."
4,california sun still shines,"If You want to hear the Rivieras, the lead singer Marty Fortson still sings that song and many others to this day in South Bend, Indiana. Only now, Fortson has his own band called the ""Wildcats."" Still the same old Riviera fun, along with some of the original members joining him from time to time. Just some good ol fun time rock and roll."
5,A winning resource for math-haters,"Do you hate math? Are you fearful before taking an algebra test? Do you avoid taking your math classes until the last few semesters before graduation? If you answered yes to all of these questions, or even just one, you should definitely consider purchasing this book! Read it, try the suggestions that match your learning style (my style is visual/social, except for a handful of classes in which I study more effectively alone), and do yourself a favor by adopting a positive attitude towards math. I know it's easier said than done, but you can pass math, and manage to enjoy it as well. Do not be afraid to use resources like books, study aid hand-outs from your college learning center, math videos, and your instructor. After all, they do want you to successfully pass their class. One last tidbit of advice that I'll offer is this: do not wait until the final exam to study or to get help. Start studying for this exam the first day of class."
5,Let your baby see other babies loving Jesus,"This joyful video shows babies and toddlers enjoying praise and worship music. The children play together in various everyday and fantasy situations while listening to the high quality music. Your baby will learn by watching the other children dance and play to such songs as; ""Jesus Loves the Little Children"", ""Oh, Happy Day"", ""Joy, Joy Down in My Heart."" The music is upbeat and the babies are having fun. An awesome part of teaching your baby how to love Jesus from birth through the toddler years."
2,Very Dark and the Windows hit them when you roll them up,"I was not very happy with these window visors, they are very dark making blind spots on the windshield-door pillars and covered some of the rear view mirrors and the windows also hit them when you rolled them up, it even broke the rear visor within a few days of installing them. They have some glue that comes pre-installed on the visors but only one of them had enough to do any good. I will say they looked great and they kept the rain out when the window were down a little bit so the vehicle did not get as hot inside. I replaced them with some visors that stick to the outside of the Chanel, they don't look as good but they work a lot better and they are only smoked instead of almost blacked out so you can see through them so they don't cause a big blind spot. Good luck and I hope this helps you."
1,Not worth the money,Upon installation the back window went in pretty easily. The front window screwed up the rubber on the window and made the window roll up crooked. Then when rolling the back window up and down the back one fell out. Don't waste your money on this product. They look nice but cause the windows to work improperly.
2,Didn't fit quite right,"The rear window shades fit well and didn't catch, probably because they were taped.The visors came poorly packed so the drivers side visor had a couple small broken pieces on the end. I installed them anyway to see if they would still work.The drivers and passenger side front windows would catch on the visor or take a few up and downs to roll up correctly. The broken drivers side would not fit in the track and pop out a little after rolling down the window.I installed them per the directions and left them up for 4 days. I returned them to Amazon without any hassle.They looked really nice on the Cherokee and didn't stick out too far. If they worked I would have been really happy with them."
3,Preston Bailey's Fantasy Weddings,"Fantastic pictures - great visual stimulationNot much how to infomation, but a good to help generate ideas.Preston Bailey's Design for Entertaining: Inspiration for Creating the Party of Your Dreams is recommended for a more information on how to achieve the look."
3,Amazing Ideas with flowers!,This book really shows some fantastic ideas for your wedding day.It has a vast amount of projects represented by beautiful colour photographs.It has given me a few ideas although I would say the weddings in the book cost a fortune and so you need to take the essence of the ideas and bring them down to an affordable level.Also it really is a floral decoration book and although there is good use of lighting and candles ninety percent of the book is about flower decoration be it in a ''never seen before way''.However it is very inspiring and beautiful and would also make a great coffee table book or present for a designer/florist.
4,Beautiful Florals,This book has phenomenal images of floral arrangements and venue decorations. Preston Bailey's work is definitely over the top. Your bride or wedding planner will love to add this to their collection.
4,nice,"Very nice everyday dinnerware set. The only thing is, that the soup bowls are very small ( good for kids). Fast shipping and well packed."
5,Very funny!,"I bought this years ago for my sister. This book is a riot! Of course, it's dark humor, but it's a lot of fun to look at the doodles and notes to himself."
2,Beautiful book but disappointing,"I had been looking for years for a large beautifully illustrated book that would cover the history of the rose in art and culture throughout the world. I thought this book was it, and I was so excited, especially after glimpsing the first chapter on line. When I received the book, I was horribly disappointed - only the first chapter covers the rose in art and culture - the rest of this huge heavy tome is illustrated with hundreds of botanical rose illustrations taken from the Horticultural Society's collection. This book is good for the serious rose grower who wants to know detailed information on each type of rose, their latin names, and what parent roses were used to create hybrids. With that said, it is a beautiful book, but not what I was looking for - I gave it away to someone. So this still leaves a niche wide open for a beautiful history of roses that would appeal to a wide audience - it's hard to believe that this has not been done yet."
4,About a great man of passion,"Matthijs Vermeulen is one of the most original composers of the 20th century.His music opens a world of intensity, positive and vively obsession, a sky of pure emotions. His person as his music is (positively!)unconventional and highly personal.I got the feeling: you love it or you don't!I like it a lot!! It's the same case with Allan Pettersson (1911-80)This label brings his music slower than the other of donemus. The second symphony takes 25'here and the donemus about 20'. I prefer the donemus because I have the feeling that vermeulen wanted the tempi faster and the drive is more intense with donemus.But it's well done! For that 4 stars. Try this music, it's an overwhelming feeling: so much passion!"
5,Just what I was looking for,"I have read some of Gaebelein's other books andfound him t be thorough. My wife and I have been studying Daniel, Matthew 24-25 and Reveltion for a few years now, along with reading the Bible each year. To get a more thourough understanding of Revelation, you should understand Daniel and Matthew 24-25. To this end it has been a great book."
2,Minnie & Moo,Misleading advertising. Arrived as a small paperback the price of a hardbound. Extremely disappointed.
2,Pleasant but Forgetable,"This was okay as far as trashy romance novels go. The characters both had their mysterious past wounds that needed healing, through lots and lots of sex. Of course, this leads to them finding true love with each other. There was very little conversation between the hero and heroine that wasn't an out right fight (both between each other and internally between mind and over powering hormones)It was very quick paced, and inspite of its super crazy plot (500 million??) didn't make it impossible for me to read, but I doubt I will remember it in a week."
3,:0(,I think it was missing something and also that it could have been more and it wasn't strong enough...it is kinda hard to put in words but it just diodn't do it for me...
4,Only good because it works with good software for Palms / Treos,"The GPS10 is a pretty basic piece of equipment. It doesn't have the latest GPS chipset known as SIRF Star3. So the reception isn't great and it's pretty slow at getting satellites.But, if you want to use Garmin Software (iQue) on your Treo or Palm, it's the only choice you have. Garmin software uses a proprietary protocol that can only ""talk"" with Garmin GPSs.Another feature on the good side is that the unit is a magnet that you can simply put on the roof of your car and it doesn't budge. The range for bluetooth is more than 15ft so it still works perfectly.So, if you have a Palm or Treo and the GPS10X still isn't out, it's a pretty good choice."
4,Great - But some of them die quickly,"I've ordered about 20 of them. This is the best bluetooth GPS receiver out there. But I've had 4 or 5 of them just quit after a few uses. Garmin grumbles but honors the warranty by completely replacing the unit. GILware software is the best Windows based GPS navigation and mapping software and I use it in conjunction with these units; it is a great, easy to use setup.Update: I think I discovered the problem with the Garmin 10s...if you leave them on charge (they often only come with a vehicle charger) for substantially more than the two hours it takes to charge them they seem to burn up; this may be because they automatically turn on when on charge. So, just be careful to only charge them for a couple of hours per session."
4,If your only way of navigating is Garmin maps.,"It's probably one of the best bluetooth GPS receivers anywhere. However, it's very pricy. Of course you are forced to buy if the maps you need are only available from Garmin. Otherwise TomTom/Destinator/Navigon all provide better navigation software that works with other generic receivers that are much much cheaper.Saying that, I still think it's better than most bluetooth GPS receivers out at the moment."
4,Slick Device,"Bought sensor only, works with my HP Tablet PC without a problem.Using Microsoft MapPoint 2006 and ESRI ArcGIS without a hitch.The power port has a ""small"" rubber plug that got lost quickly."
1,BEWARE: Carginogenic - Prop65 in the manual.,"The manual says THIS PRODUCT, ITS PACKAGING AND ITS COMPONENTS CONTAIN ONE OR MORE CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER, BIRTH DEFECTS OR REPRODUCTIVE HARM.Garmin fails to advertise this on their website. You gotta buy this product to find out afterwards."
3,works but the connector is a bit flaky,"This cable is cheap so I can't complain about the purchase.My only gripe is that the pins on the connector don't seat well in the Treo, making the connection iffy. I tried to bend the pins back to make a better contact, but that didn't help. You get what you pay for."
4,A Fitting Farewell,"Like their first three albums, ""A Day out of Time"" manages to raise the Goose Bumps in what I think is an excellent note of finality to this West Coast band. Their Jazz and tribal blend carry with it a form of musical energy rarely found on a C.D. This also speaks to the production value put into a live C.D. like this one. The group has found the best way to carry the essence of the three previous albums at a heightened level in this fitting farewell."
3,don't start here,"I very much liked Trance Mission's three studio albums, but this live set I found very disappointing. Production and such are up to snuff, but the material was not well chosen and the overall effect is pretty repetitious and even boring. That's too bad, because the studio albums were very carefully constructed and maintained interest from start to finish. I would much recommend any of the other three over this one."
4,"Better than ""Letters............""","When I bought this book, I bought one of the ""letters"" series books as well. I was very disappointed with the letters series, finding the stories short, male fantasy dominated, and just plain unbelievable. This book, on the other hand, I loved. It catered to heterosexuals, lesbians, and exotic lovers. The stories catered to both men and women giving each the time and lovin' they deserved unlike many other erotic books, where details lack and people orgasm in one sentace or less. A great read, and it never gets boring."
2,It's definitely my Grandmother's erotica,"When I chose this book, I thought I would see a collection of stories parallel to the magazine ""Penthouse Letters"" or ""Variations"". Instead, I have a very lyrical, poetic book of erotica that is nicely written, but not at all what I was expecting."
3,Not bad...,but could be better... The stories are fairly short & to the point but could afford to get a little more detailed & steamier.
5,Best ever Chopin,Do not hesitate. I have no doubt that this is Pollini's best Chopin recording. The melodious singing line and dramatic tension are beyond compare. Not only that but the sequence leads from one nocturne inexorably to the next so that at the end you feel you have been listening to one great work rather than 19 separate nocturnes (a bit like the Diabelli Variations). All others pale by comparison. I'm trying not to go over the top but without success. Go on treat yourself.
5,Chopin: Nocturnes Pollini,Service was excellent and I love listening to this CD. I saw Pollini in Boston recently and am happy to be able to continue listening to these wonderful selections.BW
3,Does someone have emphysema?,"I have to agree with some of the reviewers here. The performance I feel is wonderful, but, and this is a big but, do not purchase this cd if you have a tube amp and high efficiency rated speakers. I know someone will ask, so what I listen with is a Marantz CD6004 player (with the super DAC's) coupled to a 1962 H.H. Scott 299C amp with modified Klipsch heritage speakers of about 103db sensitivity rating. It picks up everything good and bad in the recording and in this recording it sounds like Dennis Hopper from the movie ""Blue Velvet"" sitting on the piano bench next to Mr. Pollini breathing on his emphysema machine. It is that bad! So if you have a high quality hi-fi system avoid this like the plague...............otherwise, enjoy."
2,"Great Playing, Awful Breathing Noises","My title says it all. The playing is beautiful, though a bit harsh. The recording is just trash though. You can hear loud nasal, old man breathing noises throughout the whole thing. It's almost like a joke. It's kind of mind blowing that someone would allow that on a professional recording. Way too distracting for me to listen to it. I'll listen to Rubenstein or Arrau instead. When I listen to Chopin I want to close my eyes and get lost in it, not wince every few seconds at the sound of a whistling nose."
2,"""Yamaha""-like performance and poor recording","As one other reviewer put it: ""Pollini does not have the varnish that other pianists add to these nocturnes"". Well, if I may say so, it is that ""varnish"" that makes a performance an interpretation rather than cold, machine-like output. If that is you preference, you'll love these disks. If not - look elsewhere. The quality of the recording itself deserves one star - it is the worst DG recording I've ever listened to. Bizarre noises and echos are clearly audible."
2,Bacco Shoes,"Extremely comfortable shoes, but they are falling apart in the front and the bottom is already wearing down."
3,Too bulky and noisy,"Tried to use this pump for a home made Water Cool System.The pump worked fine but was a little too noisy for my purpose. I decided to go with a Danger Den DD12V-D5 Pump, which has been an excellent choice for my system. It runs on average eighteen hours seven days a week and still run as good as the day I installed it into my system."
1,Pet Life Jacket,"The Jacket has helped my dog Zoey gain conidence in the pool, she has to swim daily as she has joint problems, and the jacket has made her life so much easier with her Hydro Therapy. It is a perfect fit and has the floatation under her neck as well as on her back which i found excellent."
2,"Sorry Randy, I must say....I'm torn as well.","Randy Kohrs is a great musician, he can play, arrange, sing, perform....... yet, as a writer & single act, I must admit to having expected much more from him than this.The song writing suffers & the album project suffers as a result. Randy needs to get aquainted with Chris Stuart & hang out for a few (years) weekends & get the hang of how a story gets penned for a song. This will be the first Bluegrass CD that I will be re-selling, I keep all that I want to continue hearing, even after a hard drive failure. I would not miss this CD, at all."
1,junk pieces of plastic,"I ordered three of these (the silver ones), one for my three and half year old son, and one each for his cousins aged 5 and 6. The set looked beautiful in the package, but when I opened the package and took the binoculars in hand, I realized I was holding a junk piece of plastic! One of the eyepieces broke within a minute due to the poorly designed (?) hinge. The telescope is supposedly a 10X power, but is just a plastic tube with two lenses on each end. The compass keeps pointing to the East as North. The flashlight seems like the best of the six items. A bonus wrist watch is so thick and huge that forget 6 year olds, it's big even for adults. The set also includes a fixed focus, fixed speed, no flash, reusable camera. I am sure it will take pictures, but I am not inclined to keep it. I am returning all the three sets. (...)At (the price) my expectations were already not very high. But with this quality, this stuff is not even worth the packaging and shipping charges."
3,"A lovely picture book, but light on information","In general, I love Ann Lovejoy's books. They're enjoyable to read and when I read her essays, I always seem to find myself muttering, ""Oh! that's why that isn't growing well"" or ""that sounds like something I should try in that spot in the rose garden"". But this book is more of a picture book than a collection of essays. It's a lovely picture book, though, if that's what you're looking for. If not, I'd recommend one of her other books, like The Border in Bloom or The Garden in Bloom."
1,Worthless,"Not quite a beautiful picture book. Certainly not informative. This reads a lot like a school assignment, the writing is all that childish style of writing where you pick something very simple to say and then just pad it up to fill space, like we'll say ""the northwest is very wet"" on this page but pad it up to two paragraphs. Gross."
2,immortality of the soul,"close, but no accolades... an immortal soul?..just to keep one writhing in torment in pain for centuries?..Not the God I serve!"
1,False Advertisement,Only the top part of this photo comes with the product. I sent it back to you at my expense for the postage/freight.
3,Not fiery enough for me,"The performances of both works are fine, but never quite catch the right amount of fire/energy. Everything sounds very tame and reined in. Comparing the Blacher to the great recordings by Kegel and Solti, the playing is not nearly as incisive and the contrasts just aren't as emphasized - the jazzy variations sound stilted. I'd say the same goes for the Tchaikovsky symphony, which is a nice performance but not in any way distinctive. Part of this may be due to the blunting of the recorded sound, which fails to ever really offer any impact in loud passages."
4,not rubbery,The whisk part is very stiff nylon material. It whisks stuff fairly well but you can't quite get into the sharp corner of a pot with it because of the rounded shape.
5,great whisk,"This is an awesome nylon whisk - it doesn't have overlapping bars, so there's more surface contact on the bottom of the pan. Love it."
1,"Does not belong to a ""Professional"" series","It is a shame to give this book a ""Professional"" title - it is rudimental in every sense. I can't even call it a rehash of the manual, because MS documentation is much deeper.Book is un-inspiring and wriiten in a very bad language.In general, I see Wrox sliding down on my scale, while Microsoft Press shining. Just try to compare this ""Professional"" book with Charles Petzold's ""Programming Windows with C#""!"
1,Did nothing!!,"I read great reviews on this one and decided I would give it a try, but sad to say it did nothing at all for my frizz! And barely anything for the shine. It was disappointing, I wouldn't recommend it at all."
1,DISAPPOINTED WOMAN,"When I read the reviews I thought the book would talk about foreplay. I can't tell the story, but I bought it for my husband. After a week he told me he had read some,-but I wasn't getting any good response, so I asked him for the book-. I read it in less than an hour, and I was so disappointed my heart sank... the book mostly encourages on being a closed union to take care of everyday chores equally. We have that already, we're like perfect roomates, get along great, everyday chores get happily distributed by themselves between the both or us. But he keeps thinking that if he's a good husband, meaning all that it's in this book, then he only needs to be ""in the mood"" may be once a month, and just go silently and finish within a minute. I'm sorry this book didn't help my pathetic life.Ray Romano Inawomansbody."
5,Fantastic service!!!,"I ordered this book during the first week of school, and it arrived in less than a weeks and a half at my door step; that alone is enought to give this review a five star rating. The book itself was intact, a little worn out but nothing the seller didn't warn me about."
3,Cheap,"It's not in it's best condition and it came later than i expect it would be. It's did came before the dead line. but what can one expect for the cheap price i'm paying. Not a lot of teachers use this edition anymore, but some still do allow you to use this one."
4,Probably the best book on JFK,"There are dozens of books on JFK and the whole Kennedy clan. So why read this one? This biography is recent and includes new information about Kennedy's extensive medical history and other documents that had been restricted when previous biographies were written. It includes the good and bad about Kennedy. So why the 4 stars? This book drags in several spots. Still, if you are looking for just one book to read on JFK I don't think you can do much better than this one. If however, you are looking to read about the whole Kennedy family I would recommend reading Laurence Leamer's three books on the Kennedy's: The Kennedy Men, The Kennedy Women and Sons of Camelot. They are excellent."
4,An overcomer,"This was a very detailed account of the comparatively short life of JFK. His appalling lack of sexual morality was balanced by a sound judgement in political and world matters such as illustrated by the Cuban missile crisis. Although not an admirer of the Kennedy family, one sympathizes with his determination and fortitude to overcome his physical problems and rise to the number one position in the country in spite of almost constant and at times excruciating pain. The book was well written and held my attention to the end."
3,Too detail oriented and slow,I did not like the book even though I am a big fan of JFK. It was tedius and slow. Too many unnecessary details for my liking.
2,An Unfinished Book,"I thought that I would love this book because I am interested in JFK.What I found was a lousy book that spent much of it detailing Kennedy's political career and leaves out or does not go into much detail about significant events that happened to him while in Political Office. Also much of the info can be found in numerous other books about JFK or the Kennedy Family with little new information.I was also disappointed about his discussion about the assassination. After all this time and all the information out there the author still thinks that Oswald killed JFK.If you are interested in JFK, this might not be the book for you"
1,A verbal re-assassination,"This is not up to Dallek's standards, much less those of any first rate historian. All hearsay and rehash. What a shame that 40 years after the first assassination, JFK must be assassinated again."
4,Adequate First Kennedy Biography,"Thought that the book was an adequate one volume account of the life of JFK. The author talked alot about JFK's medical problems, more than I would have liked. He could have written a chapter about the medical problems JFK had with his stomach and back and about how the Kennedy's covered up those ailments during the run for the presidency and during the presidency.But overall I thought that it was a very good book and would recommend to anyone who is reading their first Biography of Kennedy."
5,THE best single volume on JFK,"As the leading civilian authority on the U.S. Secret Service (and President Kennedy's interaction with the agency), I was much interested in this book by Robert Dallek. I was not disappointed: great writing style and use of sources, as well as some interesting NEW information. Dallek paints a portrait of a great but flawed man (who among us is perfect?). I highly recommend this book. vince palamara"
4,Slow but Steady,"The book looks like new and the price was great. Shipping was slow and I wasn't able to track where it was, but it came within the given time frame so no big deal. I wasn't in a huge hurry. Look forward to reading it. Thank you!"
3,Puzzled.,"I am somewhat puzzled after reading this book. I think the author tended to trivialize Pres. Kennedy's sexual exploits. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but I think the Pres. had a problem. I also question the extent of his medical problems. I'm not a Doctor, but common sense seems to say that they couldn't have been as bad as they are depicted. I was enthused (?) when I started reading this book, but I was somewhat disappointed when I finished. I also think that the author somewhat belabored some of Kennedy's situations with education, the Bay of Pigs, Cuba, etc. It he was writing a manual for the politicians he did well...if a book forthe average reader he missed to boat a wee bit."
3,Too much humdrum detail.,"At times, I felt that I was reading pages and pages of JFK's gastro-intestinal maladies, and back problems with simply too much detail. The meat of the biography was just intertwined in between his doctors visits!"
5,Objective; Not hero worship,"I have read multiple book about JFK and this,, by far is the best. It reveals information about his early life, his serious almost life long medical issues ,his triumphs and failures and, of course, his sexual excesses.The author had access to The White House tapes which was very interesting and maybe this is why it was much more comprehensiver than anything else I ever read."
4,Surprising Book,"Having lived during his lifetime, I was never aware of a lot of what is in this book, but really enjoyed reading about what was happening in that time period. He was not as nice a person as I remembered him being and that's sad."
4,Excellent work,"The nine-hour abridged Audible version provided good coverage of JFK's early life, wartime heroics, congressional career, and Cuban and Vietnam policies, without the typical sensationalizing usually found in JFK bios. The author also brought to light some very interesting facts such as JFK's health adversities and fiscal conservatism. I expected to hear more on the relationship with LBJ, but after all, it was an abridged version."
4,Great Read,I started book recently and find it to be interesting. Can't wait to read every night. Brings back memories of years ago. I recommend this book.
3,This biography had no sparkle.,"It seems impossible to write pages and pages about John Kennedy, only to leave the reader feeling ""Nice, talented man who had his faults, but was nothing special, as boring as anybody.""this"
5,A Great Book on One of the Many Kennedy's Life,"I admired President Kennedy for what he did as President in such a short term. This book gives all the background of his life from growing up in a tight-knit Catholic family where father, Joe, was, on the surface a staunch political figure, but clandestingly, a womanizer who destroyed his relationship with his faithful wife, Rose, to the very end in that infamous day in Dallas. The book proceeds and reveals the courage and brave attitude John possessed in assisting his WWII buddies, the almost total reliance on his father Joe in getting involved in the political scene, and, unfortuantely, the same womanizing his father embraced, as his wife, Jackie, apparently knew about, but just like her mother-in-law, Rose, kept this pain in her heart because of her love for John. A great book that seems to tell all!"
5,All new Findings and Information,"Wow. I was always on the fence about JFK, but this book was a tipping point for me. I couldn't believe all of the struggles that JFK dealt with beyond what was already public.I think it was public info that he had a bad back due to the war, but no one new how he was secretly whisked away to the Mayo clinic in Minnesota to get treatments that had been kept under wraps.I always wondered if he hadn't been assassinated, how long he might've lived. I don't think that much longer, due to his poor health.I'd check this out. It is a different story than what we've been told"
3,Interesting but rather dry,"Robert Dallek has done a great job of researching for this book, and when it comes to JFK:s years in the White House he doesn't leave many stones unturned. But the book suffers from a slightly cold and unpersonal tone, and Kennedy's childhood and formative years are covered too briefly. Vital events that greatly shaped JFK:s life and personality, like the deaths of his brother Joe Jr and his sister Kathleen in the 1940s are, for instance, never properly investigated. Still, it's a fair representation of the Kennedy era."
3,a fairly good biography,"An unfinished life is a fairly good biography.I think that the author tells not enough about JFK's youth.Sometimes it's very boring and not interesting.There are some strange affirmations, because the author invents them.The people who knew him ( like Sorensen, Schlessinger..) says not this affirmations but often the opposite.The author tells nothing about his relation with his wife and children.The author tells more about Kennedy's politic than the man and that's harm.He tells once about jfk jr and tree times about Caroline!The best part of the book are the pictures, there isn't a lot but some are rare.I don't recommended it. I suggest you if you want a very complete biography: Kennedy by Sorensen, The fitzgeralds and the Kennedys. And if you want a short biography:young Jfk..."
4,A beauty that needs updating,"This beret is very well made. However getting a correct fit is a problem.The leather border inside is too stiff and lacks flexability, so there is no room for individual adjustments. It either fits or it doesn't there is no inbetween and I'm inbetween as I guess most people are!"
4,Size DOES matter,"This is a really great item for my newborn who fusses - if she won't nod off (or gets the hiccups), I carry her around in it and she ALWAYS falls asleep. The only caution is that I ordered a larger size thinking it would be more comfortable for me, however, the sling hangs too low and bounces around alot rather than being more snug fitting like the photo. Definitely don't upgrade a size! Even so, it still works well for me but will take a toll on your back after a while. We also have the Baby Bjorn which is great as well for my husband, I recommend having both options for different reasons (flexibility, different features)."
2,Couldn't get it to work for me and baby,Maybe this is meant for extra tiny babies? But I got the large size. This was pretty much a useless item for me. I didn't return it because I thought that I might get the hang of it. But just couldn't manage to stuff the baby inside this thing without worrying that she would suffocate or somehow get mangled. I got the Maya sling wrap instead. That one works great!
5,POW!,"One of the best CDs I ever bought! Too bad Capitol is sitting on the follow up to this session! ""That Travilin' 2 Beat"" finds May and Clooney trippin the light fantastic around the world with Bing again! But like so many great sessions of theirs .... Capitol just sits on it! Thank goodness I have it on a tape and Lp... although the eq is not up to what it could be if remixed for CD!"
3,Grandma's Coffee Cake - Service Unequal,"I have purchased products from CoffeeCakes.com through Amazon for a while with no problem. All purchases were gifts, sent to another address, no problem. I live in New Zealand, sending the purchase to people in the United States.I received an advertisement email directly from CoffeeCakes.com with a discount offer. I attempted to use this offer, but THEY don't accept orders from nasty foreign countries. New Zealand is not a corrupt dictatorship full of criminals trying to steal banking info from Americans or trying to get you to claim a million dollars left in a paper bag outside a public toilet.Why do they accept orders placed through Amazon but not made directly to their website? It has upset me enough to stop buying products from CoffeeCakes.com, even through Amazon. There are lots of other products to send as gifts to friends in the U.S."
2,Cake,Gift a little stale n didn't care for after taste so wouldn't order again n try to remember that for next year
5,Amazing movie!,"This DVD was a great purchase. I've been skiing for years, and have kept myself up to date with the US Ski Team, and how they do year in, year out. This DVD gave me an inside look into the minds of 2 of the best downhill racers in the world. This DVD was very well put together, and is a must have for all ski enthusiasts. Add it to your shopping cart!"
4,Antiques and Mystery,"Jonathan Gash has created a mystery series in which the ""detective"" is a somewhat shady English antiques dealer named Lovejoy. I have no great knowledge of or interest in antiques, but I found Mr. Gash's discussions of antiques and of the antiques business fascinating. The books in this series are worth reading as an introductory course in antiques. In the later books in the series, Lovejoy's irrational and self-destructive behavior may bother some readers. Lovejoy's treatment of women is likely to bother feminists.The Judas Pair is an early Lovejoy mystery. A man who claims to own a legendary set of matching dueling weapons is murdered, and the weapons are not found in his collection. Lovejoy is hired by the victim's brother to look into the situation. Lovejoy is not an armchair detective; sex and violence attend the search for the murderer."
2,Antiques yes - women no,"I could not believe the author's view of women. Although his writing about antiques was informative, his amateurish and often silly description of women in the book detracted from the story line."
3,Get a coffee; you'll need it,"Oh, how this book drones on and on. I could write a 10 page book report, and cover all that this anvil of a textbook has to inform you about. I suppose it's a good source if you don't know how to identify objects from overhead, but beyond that, you will need something to keep you focused as you read through the pages. On the plus side, this book is extremely well illustrated, and there's plenty of interesting side notes about specific satellites."
4,good deal,this was a good deal on the book but slow delivery. it was delivered at the last day of the expected delivery window
3,Fun to read,"I liked this book. A bit slow at first, but then it picks up and hard to put down. I would like to see this in a movie."
4,Finding Yourself,"Another delightful tale from Mr. Koontz. This one tells the tale of how you can find yourself after you've lost your life, or at least how your life used to be. Truman learns to live again through a lost child and the return visit of an old friend. I enjoyed the ending... I didn't see it coming."
2,I disagree with many of the reviews,"I just didnt' connect with this book. It was a neat premise but lacked a real believable plot. The characters were uncharactoristically cardboard... Koontz doesn't usually pen characters that are so lifeless and unmotivated. The chapters were like 3 pages long, which is not out of the norm for Koontz by any means... but out of 90 something chapters, I wound up skipping more than 40 just to get through it. That's a bad sign."
2,not my cuppa....,"You know when you're just about to get on a long flight and you grab a paperback at the airport newsstand? Well, I grabbed THE FACE thinking I'd amuse myself with a fun, fast paced suspense thriller. Having never read any of Koontz's prior works, I wasn't prepared for this strange mixture of genres: detective meets supernatural.I won't give away any of the plot points in case this is your kind of book...it wasn't mine. I will say, however, that good story structure and interesting characterizations wre overshadowed by corny dialogue, incessant pop culture references and some of the most repugnant, sadistic scenarios I've ever read in a work of fiction. If this were a movie, it would be rated NC-17.If you like angels and demons with your cops and killers, you will enjoy this. Otherwise, work on the crossword puzzle in the airline magazine."
5,An Absolute Must Read,"WOW! Just finished the book, grabbed me and wouldn't let go, cried my eyes out at the end, page after page of tears!! Absolutely the best book ever! To all Koontz fans this is a 'must read' to all other readers, your about to become a FAN!!"
4,One of Koontz' best,"DK has outdone himself here. One can almost forgive him for the disappointment of ODD THOMAS in all its mediocrity.THE FACE is strong in plot, relentless in pacing, and, of course, a fast-paced, thumb-blistering page turner of a novel.The characters are, for the most part, three dimensional, although there are some who exist solely to advance the story and are no more fleshed-out than necessary. My only criticism is that I wish that one character had had one more scene before being deservedly banished from the stage.Highly recommended."
4,The face takes a while to get to know,"Its very good, but the first 2/3rds of the book is VERY descriptive and kinda goes a little slowly, which I think is uncharacteristic of Dean. But, the end makes it worthwhile."
5,"Still the great Koontz, brilliant, magic","The Face was in my possession one week before The New Harry Potter so there was no moment of indecision - i shall not spoil the story by discribing it - know only it is typical Koontz, evil, magic, supernatural, loyalty and friendship from beyond the grave, and different from many novels, a super ending."
4,Good,"For such dark material, the book was remarkably funny! Fric was too cute and I loved how he got his name! Corky was amusing, for a character of his inclinations, and very well written.While it wasn't my favorite Koontz, it was still quite enjoyable. The characters were all well written, and the story expertly crafted to slowly reveal bit by bit. It was a bit long, but held your attention. There was quite a bit of violence, but it was not overly graphic and blended seamlessly into the story. The reader, Dylan Baker, was very, very good. I wasn't entirely sure about him at the beginning, but he grew on me."
5,Good Read,"Since so many have given descriptions, I'll skip that. It seems Dean Koontz has been slowly incorporating into his books the mystical and spiritual. ""The Face"" is evidence of this to a larger degree. Wonderful story line with this one. I loved the guardian angel/dark angel conflict, the boy Fric who seems much older than he actually is, and the tormented Truman. The message this one sends is heartwarming."
3,"I miss the ""old"" Dean Koontz","When I first started this book, I had to check the author's name again to make sure it was Dean Koontz. While I've always enjoyed his writing flourish (we use to bet how many pages in we would find the word ""macadam""), his newest style is definitely overgrown. Too many metaphors and adjectives take away from full character development and the plot. While the message is heartening, I'm not convinced that the journey was worth it."
3,blockbuster horror,"Never let it be said that Dean Koontz stints on words or holds back on plot complications, for his legions of readers. This 600-page opus is no exception. Filled with high tech objects and trendy, up-to-the-minute expressions, ""The Face"" is a gothic tale of horror, a journey into the fringe of the unconscious, that will give you nightmares. It can be read on several levels---even as a simple tale of good v. evil, of redemption after sin.This book will make your airport delays and your long flights seem much shorter, as Dean unwinds his tale of Fric, the bright but unbeautiful son of two extremely attractive, shallow entertainment- industry parents. Fric is placed in peril by sinister forces, but with the help of former cop Ethan, who works for his movie-star father as security chief, he battles through.A word to the wise: Don't answer phone line 24, especially after dark!"
2,Overdone in too many ways,"Stephen King writes multiple works that fill 30 CDs in the audio version, and you want moe. ""The Face"" is 16 CDs where the story would have been more acceptable with 8. Blatent redundancy, multiple linquistically complex descriptors of people, events, thoughts, etc, where one clear and cogent descriptor would have not only sufficed, but would have been better. A decent story line, stretched to the maximum, and overwritten. It is my ""entry"" move into Koontz and I am afraid it is also gong to be my ""exit"" move.One reviewer noted it was the best work of Koontz so far. If this is true, I am most tnankful that I did not read earlier works. His writing style reminds me of more than one bombastic professor lecturing in my undergrad classes in American Lit. And you ask why I gave it a ""1""?"
4,appeals to the ten year old part of us,"fantasy thriller, not too scary, doesn't qualify as ""horror"". The writing is good enough, the characters are beguiling and the author is a good storyteller. I liked the book more than I expected to."
2,"If you trudge through, the book isn't awful.","I'm relatively new to Koontz's writing, and have read four of his novels. This is the weakest of them all. The first 60% is incredibly tough to get through. It seems Koontz spends so much time with describing unnecessary details. Perhaps he's paid per word. His writing can get so bogged down with too much information and ""vocabulary words."" It's unnecessary stuff, and I tend to skip tons and tons of paragraphs to get to the story.The person who gave me this book couldn't finish, and I nearly quit too. But the last 25% of the book is pretty good, again, once you get past all the unnecessary details like why one of the landscapers put long poles in the ground to help the young saplings. Who cares Dean???? Really? Who cares?There's a lot of Christian allegory and some myth in here, which I like a lot, but overall this book is a big disappointment. You want a great Koontz book, read ""Life Expectancy."""
5,"buckle up, you're in for a ride","I have had a love/hate relationship with Koontz's books. There have been a few I liked alot, and a few I couldn't stand, but The Face is one I couldn't put down. I found myself reading it every chance i got.Aelfric Manheim is the son of a famous actor who is loved and adored by many. Fric lives a priveledged life but is starving for the attention all kids desire. He soon gains attention he doesn't want!Without giving any of the story away, I have to say there were moments when I had goosebumps on my arms. I also found I was breathing heavy out of fear. This is the best book Mr. Koontz has ever written. You come to love Fric and find yourself rooting for him. It's like watching a horror film on T.V. and screaming for the hero not to open the door. I was drained by the time I got to the last page.If you are looking for a book to make your heart beat faster and your pulse race, then i highly recommend this book."
4,Dean Koontz... The Face,"This is the first Dean Koontz book I have read. I like Clive Cussler and Robert Ludlum. Lots of action. They keep me reading. I am half way through The Face. It is slow paced, not holding my interest as yet. Dean is a wordsmith. Story filled with a lot of unnessary paragraphs... clutter. seems to me written to impress the readers as to how he is able to use words."
2,Yawn!!,"To me, this book was a major letdown of what I was expecting. It just didnt grab my attention like a really good book does, although I do have to admit that it got better as it went along.And one other thing that I did not like about it was the fact that the guy who worked in the morgue had the same name as the guy in Rosemary's Baby, Roman Castevets. I was thinking that if you are going to write a book, at least use original names."
1,The Face,"This book was so full of metaphors, adjectives and the like, it made the reading unbearable. It was nothing like any Koontz books I had read in the past and I was extremely disappointed. The storyline revolves around a little boy and the man who saves him from a physcho killer. Half of the book could have been left out. I won't stop reading Koontz but hope this new styling of writing doesn't last long."
1,The Face,"I swore after the last book; I was through buying Koontz's books, but after reading the reviews, I did. I bought the book on tape to listen while driving. I've had it for a month, and I haven't finished it. I read the reviews, and I'm not sure we were reading the same book. I don't plan to rehash the plot but I am half way through, and I'm still not sure where this story is heading except a lot of murder and mayhem or is it ""Much Ado About Nothing."" One day I will be so bored I'll finish. How I long for the old Koontz!!!!"
1,I threw the hard cover in the garbage,"Rarely do I not finish a book. Never have I thrown a book into the garbage can until now. I got to page 180 and decided to stop torturing myself. It's about nothing. Everytime you think it's going to get good, you will be dissappointed. I can't believe how many people wrote a positive review. I had to check to make sure we were all reviewing The Face! I am done with Dean Koontz!"
1,Pure Evil,"I should preface this by stating that I have every book written by Stephen King and John Saul. I have quite a few by Dean Koontz. At the beginning, I thought that the two ""deaths' that Etan Truman, the private detective, could lead to fascinating reading. I was wrong!!!!!!! I have never read a book that featured such an evil and vile character as Corky Laputa. I have never thrown away a book, but this one is in the trash. I have never had such a feeling of pure disgust during or after reading a novel. If this is what Mr. Koontz aimed for, he succeeded."
1,Simply awful,"What gives. This is a slumming effort by Koontz. It reads as if it were inspired by a bad TV movie. Lacking in origniality, interesting characters, meaningful insight, character development, etc. Of course, not everyone requires these, but I think that they would have been nice.Avoid this. Read one of his other efforts - many are worth it. But not this one."
3,Not a review,"Well I made it through about 220 pages (read in one day) before I realized that this is probably not worth finishing. If I didn't have a back log of newer books on the shelf waiting to be read I would have suffered through the whole thing. Then again, if I had read the whole thing, maybe it would have been worth it. For what I expect and want from Koontz, it was not. Koontz, without a doubt, has a way with words, and with these he seems to be trying a new serious form that I just didn't care for. Oh well, maybe next time."
1,Terrible,"Koontz with presumably a straight face, has his chief villian in The Face refer to one of his torture victims as ""stinky cheese man."" How lame is that?I have not read a Koontz in a long time, but reading the other reviews I see that Koontz has written many good books. I'm sure that's true, The Face is not one of them.Do yourself a favor and skip this stinky cheesy book. I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time in order to skip the overly descriptive and flowery language. Give me a break, if I want to read Shakespeare, I'll read Shakespeare. Instead I was looking for a suspenceful page turner and I didn't get it.This book was at its height of stupidity at its end -- which couldn't come soon enough."
3,Face the Music,"Hmmmm...as a Koontz fan for years, I find it ok to say, ""Not your best work, Dean.""I agree with the other reviewers who stated that the book could have been 200 pages shorter. While a good Koontz chase still ensued, the beating-into-the-ground of the bad guy's intentions killed the suspense.A movie star's son is in danger of being kidnapped. We the reader know that, but the man supposed to protect him is the last to find out.And what are we to make of the end? Did Dean have a deadline? Maybe Hazard Yancy will show up in some novels yet.Do not read this as your first Koontz novel, but read it if you are a ""true"" fan, and have the time to devote to 600+ pages."
3,A great author but this is not one of his best.,"First let me say that Dean Koontz is one of my favorite authors. He never fails to grab my attention early on and keep it until the end. One of the things I love the most about his books is his sometimes warped sense of humor.That said, I have to say that this book is not going to make my ""favorites"" list. It wasn't bad and parts of it were very intense and captivating but there was just something about it that made me feel that it was a little bit off. I didn't like the ending at all.I normally don't write reviews unless I really loved the book or really hated it. I wanted to write this review for the people who may have read this as their first Koontz book and felt like me about it. Don't give up. He has written some amazing books. My favorite book of all time from any author is Watchers. Everyone I know who read it says the same thing. I know that Dean Koontz doesn't need me to defend him but he doesn't deserve some of these negative comments."
1,I Don't Know Yet,"Generally a Dean Koontz book grabs me from page one and hangs onto me until the end. I love his writing, BUT I cannot seem to get comfortable with this one. Am I the only one who sees it as a complete change from his normal writing? I've only gone 150 pages into the book and every once in awhile I stop and think...why am I reading this? It full of tedious and minute details that just go on and on. I'm still waiting for that magical ride he usually takes me on - the one where I forget time and become totally immersed in his tale...but so far, its not happening :-("
2,Does anyone have an editor?,"Mr. Koontz has finally suceeded in attempting to become Stephen King... at least in page count. This book throws useless description, weak metaphor, and as many polysyllabic words as he can cram into an overdrawn and weak mess. I found myself struggling to complete a chapter. Some of the characters are interesting, but as find yourself skipping whole pages and then just skipping to the end, you wonder, ""why did I pick up this book in the first place?""Koontz thinks he knows how to write kids, and some of the lines are funny... but most of his characterizations are just weak. If Mr. Koontz can succumb to his editor's requests to cut out the excessive detail, the annoying and poorly constructed similes, and the maudlin attempts at sympathy... then indeed, maybe he will pick up some of Stephen King's other talents instead of just spewing verbiage.This book is predictable and skippable."
3,From Fear to Freedom,"From Fear to Freedom is an account of one woman's realization over many years of how she was living in a way that contradicted what she thought she believed about God and the world. I had a hard time connecting to this book in some ways, but I think it may be a good thing. The message that was so life changing for Rose Marie, her paradigm shift from an orphan to a daughter mentality, is one that I have been taught well for many years, due in part to her family's influence.I'd recommend this book to someone coming out of a more legalistic tradition, or that struggles to believe that they are loved by God. (6/10)"
5,Their best album to date,"As many have stated previously, if you don't speak Swedish you won't understand the lyrics on this album. If you're one who enjoys lyrics, you may want to pass on this album, unless you want to understand how great music doesn't need great lyrics. The music, the production, and the lyrics on this album are tight and layered. It's almost perfect. TDL exemplifies the notion that lyrics, when used in their perfect form, are nothing more than another instrument in a song's success. It combines elements of jazz and rock in a seemless fashion. I've purchased every album since TDL, because I loved TDL so much, and while they do not match the quality of this album, they all prove the consistent quality of music this group can generate. For singles listeners that want to preview this album before purchasing the entire album, Panda is the best song on the disc, but the entire album is top notch."
2,The spice expands conciousness...,"...but this is not the spice. I read several stunning reviews of this album. Reviews saying thigs like how it is way psychedelic and exciting and amazing and all that, but really Ta Det Lugnt is nothing but mediocre progressive rock. Sure, Mr. Ejstes plays a lot of instruments, but that doesn't mean he does it in an original or interesting manner. The music is highly un-original. There is no personal or interesting twist to the style(s) of music being ripped off, so there is no reason to bother listening to it when you could pick up one of the hundreds of more progressive, more psychedelic, more original albums recorded around 1970 or so. I gave it 2 stars however, because even thought its nowhere near amazing, there is much worse music out there."
2,Swedish Psyche Rock has to be good right?,"I think just because this is Swedish Psyche Rock everyone is raving about it. The truth about this album is it never jumps out as being brilliant. Most of the material here is just okay, or subpar. I'm sure as a live act these guys are great, but personally I think it's a bunch of hype."
1,Hogwash,I not only read this book I was appalled by it. I knew this man and he was clearly mentally ill. He put the people in this book through a living hell.We all loved and respected him prior to his developing mental illness. I would not recommend this book in any category other than fiction.
4,great lunch box,This is the best lunch box we've ever had.My husband has to take a lunch everyday and there's usually no room left in the fridge...This keeps his food and drink cold just as if it had been in the refrigerator.It is durable and has plenty of room for multiple microwavable (and other) containers and dishes.great buy
2,Nice but too big,"Very nice design, good for multiple people. For 1 person, would like one a little smaller."
5,Loved it!,"This may be the type of movie where you ""had to be there"" to appreciate it. If you've spent any time around art schools or artists, you probably know these people. Every cliche you can think of is incorporated into this movie - the crazy film maker, the gay fashion major who is the only one who doesn't know he's gay, the angry lesbian, the beautiful model, and on and on. John Malkovich is great in his part as a has-been or never-was painting teacher. The scene where Jerome is having dinner with his family is so well-done that it's almost painful to watch. This is a funny little spoof, not to be taken seriously, but there's a lot of truth underneath the silly serial-killer plot."
3,The cast carries you through...,"An overall mediocre movie, I purchased it originally because I'm a sucker for John Malkovich... and he mostly delivers. Worth watching, once."
2,I wanted to love this . . .,"This dark mystery wrapped around a school-days farce could have been a really great movie in somebody else's hands, but this director really dropped the ball. The characters are mostly drawn in such raging generalities that you can pretty much recite the lines before they actors say them. I wonder if those casting the film have ever met a college student. They had the varieties right, but the ages were goofy. The obnoxious film student looked 40, the dream girl model looked more like the hero's big sister than his girlfriend. The story, on the other hand is interesting in an art-house kind of way but there is so, so much wrong! Even in the capable hands of Jim Broadbent, the villian of the piece is underdrawn. Like ""A Day Without Mexicans,"" this was a terrific idea that just didn't wash. I wish somebody more capable would make it again"
2,Falls short in everything it tries to be.,"Art School Confidential tries to be a little bit of everything; ""boy meets girl,"" dark comedy, indie flick, thriller, mystery, artsy-fartsy, etc., etc. But the problem is that the film is spread too thinly. If the producers were to have stuck to one or two genres, the film may have been really good. But unfortunately it falls short in all categories; it's somewhat funny, a little romantic, terribly predictable and not thrilling at all. I was expecting a very indie flick when I heard about it, then I thought I was watching a great comedy when the movie started, then it all just went downhill into a jumbled (and unbelieveable) mess by the end of the film."
2,"Had high expectations, story too flawed","Wanted to like it, really liked the intro and concept and the idea of the characters, all starts out endearing and quarky, but story falls apart, becomes forced. Weak and silly ending. Sorry..."
3,Too engaged in self-hate to be a likable film,"This comedy-drama directed by Terry Zwigoff (Crumb), set in a mediocre art school, is not a total disaster, it has some entertaining moments, some smart comments to make about the contemporary art scene, but you are likely to not having been through a terribly pleasant time while watching it. Somewhat better than his previous (and awful) Bad Santa, this movie is remarkable for its relentless self-hate toward artists: the film has a very sour tone of ugly contempt toward losers, which by the director's definition seems to be those 99 out of 100 artists that don't become famous. The worst losers here are not the students but the professors, which are seen as self-loathing middle aged men bitter at the world for ending up teaching at this contemptible place. And notice that I'm not even mentioning a number of silly subplots in the film, like the one about the undercover cop in the school."
1,Police Academy for the Artist,"Remember the banality of Police Academy? Remember how it was redeemed by its (at the time) original humor? Remember Revenge of the Nerds, and how its lame plot was likewise redeemed by its humor?Art School Confidential is the same formula transplanted onto art school. Sure, those other two series didn't have a full-frontal shot of a nude male model. (Not *that* kind of model, a nude drawing model.) But those other two series - or at least the original in each series - had original humor.This movie? Not so much.To be fair, it may redeem itself later on in the film. But I couldn't even make it past the first half hour to find out. If you like making fun of art poseurs and want mindless entertainment, then perhaps you will enjoy it.Otherwise, stay away."
3,Not what I was expecting,"Did anyone else see the previews for this and think it was a straight up mindless comedy? What the heck did I watch?Anyway, we you get into it and realize that it is much more of a dark comedy, you can entirely enjoy this movie. The social comentary on the whole ""What is art?"" question and the mocking of the art world in general is great. The cast is above average and the writing is actually pretty good. The series of events at toward the end were not as funny as they could've been, but still o.k.It just wasn't what I was expecting."
2,doesn't send a good message about art,"The whole concept of artists as being crazy to get fameis kind of a satire here: the serial killer is a failedartist. The young student wants to be great so he can get the girl of his dreams.End result is the young artists behind bars...?What is new and fresh in the decadent streets of New York:an undercover detective with no art training pretending to be an artist?The nude model whose Dad is a ""previously"" great artistis disillusioned with art and looking for something new and fresh too.I kind of liked the film,but I wouldn't show it to the freshman class."
3,Art for what sake?,"I'm not one of the viewers who found the ""strangler"" angle of Art School Confidential a minus, really it's rather ingeniously tied into the plot. The films more heralded moments of truth-telling insight into those who find themselves in the none too nurturing world of art education, were on the money, but wouldn't have stood on their own. Actually, some of the characterizations of various art-school archetypes are painted a little broadly for my taste, mainly I think because Zwigoff felt the need to ""get them all in there.""Still, I went to just such a school, and I was pretty amused see just how much an ""art school"" must be an ""art school"" wherever you go."
3,"Just another teen movie, sort of","This is basically another one of those 'awkward teenage boy tries to get the beautiful girl' kind of flicks, which all the while pokes fun at the world of art and art school in particular. Having graduated with a BA in Fine Art, I have to say the satire is spot on. I went to school with every one of those cliched characters, and I must admit that I saw bits of myself in there. Unless you've either been to art school, or have known artists, and have a bit of a cynical side to you, I don't think you will enjoy this. And even so, the in-jokes begin to fall a bit flat towards the end. Although I enjoyed the satire, the movie as a whole sort of disappointed me. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. But if it's a choice between this or one of those cookie cutter big budget summer action movies, pick Art School Confidential."
1,"Tedious, predictable","The preview for this movie was snarky, biting, knowing, funny. Unfortunately, the movie itself drags on, seems much longer than its actual runtime, seems fairly predictable, seems mean spirited rather than humorous, and is chock-full of unlikeable characters that it's almost impossible to empathize with. I almost walked out of the theater, and have no desire to see it again."
1,Art School Confidential,"Not funny, not suspenseful, not a love story, all around this movie stank and I would not recommend to anyone. One star is even too high a rating"
2,worst drawings ever,"For a book in this price range, we all want more. I have been doing fish illustrations in Environmental Biology of Fishes and some other journals. Dr. Nelson, you should contact me, we need to talk!!"
2,Good book but WAY OVERPRICED!,"The taxonomy of this book is dated and should be revised. The author of the book is a quality ichthyologist. However, I will not buy this book because of the ridiculous price that Wiley and Sons is asking. I would not recommend that anyone buy this book at this price. All you get are line drawings and text. Surely, Wiley and Sons can do a better job for the community of people interested in the world of fishes!"
5,Fishes of the world,"I have over 100 books on fish in my library & I would put this one in the top 5 ! Mr . Nelson covers it all . A must have for any fish nut like me ! If your looking for pretty pictures don't buy this book , but if you are looking for the classification of a fish species , this is the one ."
4,"Great book, shame about the price.",Comprehensive coverage makes this a great first reference. Most listings cite further in depth references. Published in 1994 it is probably due to be updated. The worst aspect of this book is the price. Get your library to buy it.
3,Great music but this cd is a retread of his previous songs,"I really dislike ""new"" albums that are nothing but re-issues of previous music and don't tell you this up front!!I adore Alessandro Safina and have all of his earlier CDs, and therein lies the problem. If you also have all his previous CDs, then with the exception of ""Music of the Night"" you have ALL of these songs already. If you don't, this is a great cross-cut of his music, but I truly believe you'd be better off obtaining the first four CDs then downloading ""Music of the Night"" when it's available. Otherwise, you'll get this album (terribly overpriced) and if you do love it (which I can't see you not!) you'll want his earlier work and end up duplicating everything on here. What ever you decide - he is absolutely wonderful. He has also appeared in one of Sarah Brightman's specials and their duets knocked the walls down. Enjoy!"
2,not as expected,"the sames songs diferent cover from otehr CD s of him I find out after purchasing 3 of his cd two to 3 new songs and the rest teh same as the other, shipment and time received way too long ...thanks anyway"
5,Uno de los mejores que he escuchado de Caetano Veloso,"A lo largo de la discografía de Caetano podemos encontrar versiones en vivo de sus más famosos temas. Sin embargo, muy pocas producciones (salgo algunas grabaciones Tropicalistas en LP) se pueden comparar con la energía mostrada en ""Prenda Minha"", en canciones como ""Odara"", ""Na Linha Do Equador"" y en el cierre ""A Luz de Tieta"" se luce en voz y música, en definitiva, uno de los mejores que he escuchado de Caetano VelosoManuel Linareswww.manuel-linares.com"
1,Erroneous Triva Book,"This book is not entertaining at all, the author has a way of interjecting his own views into the facts, and some of the trivia is way off. The most offensive of these errors is when he quotes Lou Gherig as saying ""I stand before you the happiest guy on the face of the Earth."" Are you an American? Even my 100 year old grandma knows that the baseball legend said ""Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth."" Not ""the happiest guy on the face of the Earth."" Come on, man. Don't publish material you know nothing about. This book is a joke."
3,Toddler Fun,"My four year old loves the funny things the Chipmunks do in this video. Not scary, just right for little kids. Isn't as enjoyable to watch over and over again for parents like other classic cartoons."
5,Great buy,"My kids love Alvin and the Chipmunks, so being able to get two on one dvd plus the extra shows was well worth it. My sons watch this all the time."
5,Wonderful Counrty Christmas Music!,"Despite the fact that most of this cd is all contemporary christmas songs, it is a must-have collection if you enjoy old country music. If you like the steel guitar and mandolins, then you will really enjoy this collection. I shared mine with my dad and he had to have a copy now I am back to get a 3rd as my original is getting worn. I keep one in my nurse's office to cheer up the season and now one at home to have while baking and wrapping. It doesn't have any words, but after awhile wordy christmas music gives me a headache! (Think mall shopping with Here Comes Santa Clause blaring!)"
5,Continuing his high standards,"Follow up to 'Dressed up like Nebraska'. Critics suggest his previous album is slightly better, I'm not sure.Songs here have a more punchy feel to them. Rouse has learned to hit melodies right on the head without dragging them out, leading to some of the songs being a lot faster than on 'Dressed up like Nebraska'.Of all the songs, the title track and 'Backstroke' will have you wanting another album from Rouse as soon as possible. A true winner of an album from Nebraska's finest."
4,An Excellent CD,"I bought this CD after listening to a few songs at the listening station of a bookstore. I couldn't get the smooth hooky pop out of my head and returned to buy it a few days later. The music has echos of many other artists but at the same time stands as a unique accomplishment. The songs flow with beautiful simplicity, but the rich texture of the music makes every listen a fresh rewarding experience. I'll be listening and hear a trombone for the first time, rewind the song and notice the cello and vibes weaved in. Rouse's earnest vocals bring a gritty reality to the songs and is well-paired with his folksy-yet-lush arrangements. If you like music at the crossroads of pop-folk-country which is extremely listenable but has heart, you should consider this album."
4,Feels Like Home,"Josh Rouse is basically the most amazing new songwriter. If he makes 3 more albums as solid as his previous two, he will no doubt reach the level of respect and neccessity as Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. All ten of these songs are soaked with basic human longing and disappointment. ""Laughter"" opens it up, an underdog's theme song with the gorgeous line ""I think my plan is safe from laughter"" as its centerpiece. ""In Between"" is a gorgeous, flippant ballad about getting over someone. Songs like ""Hey Porcupine"" and ""Directions"" focus on the disappointing behavior of other people without seeming preachy or hypocritical. It all ends with ""Little Know it All"", a gorgeous song which contains a line that the music world should take to heart: ""Be on the lookout for me""."
2,Boring,"Josh Rouse's brand of alt pop blandness falls neatly into the singer songwriter schmaltz genre so popular with tired middle aged professionals who wistfully wonder where their youth went. Boring enough to be instantly forgettable once it has stopped playing but annoying enough to grate while playing, HOME has little to recommend it, the best song is probably `Directions' but it is definitely a tune you can do without. Advice for the eclectic buyer, never, never buy an album that contains a song with `porcupine' in the title, you'll save yourself some grief. Recommended for people who can't remember the names of bands they like."
1,Money pit of a printer,"This printer will eat you out of house and home. We bought it because we looked at the toner cartridge costs, and found them to be very low. However, what they do not tell you is that the print-drum is a separate expendable item, not part of the toner cartridge as with other printers. They cost nearly as much as the printer. We never got the anywhere near promised 3000 pages out of a print cartridge, and it wanted a new drum cartridge every other toner. After a year, we gave it to GoodWill, though I can't say there really was any good will in that gesture."
4,Light Support,"Light Support best describes this brace. I have a tendon that is near tearing, I have to support it thru the day and ice it at night. The doctor gave me a support that was much more support--BUT--it wouldn't fit into any of my shoes! I saw this and thought try it. It does quick lace, fits into 'most' shoes, however, it is only a light support. Better than no support definitely, but if you're going to be on your feet for long periods of time or are thinking of this for jogging, walking, etc. and your doctor has given you a firm ankle/foot support, this is not what you want to get. I wear it in the house in the evenings after work and on the weekends to keep the tendon supported a bit while performing household jobs."
5,Danny Elfman at his finest.,Danny Elfman and Russel Shaw combined forces to make an awesome video game soundtrack...but I listen to it to get to sleep at night!
5,Great CD!!!!,"This is one of the best video-game soundtracks i have ever listened to! Some people (including pretty much everyone i know)thinks that ""Oh you've got the game you dont need the soundtrack!"" buy oh were they wrong. This CD is a great thing to have. When listening to the ""Oakvale"" track, there are so many different parts to the song that you just dont hear when playing the game because 1) You didnt stay in the town long enough to hear it or 2)was to preocupied with Man killing to actually listen to the background music. I strongly suggest that you buy it just for the fact that it is a great companion. Also, if you dont own the game, buy the game first."
5,Stands on its own.,"I don't usually go for game soundtracks (or movie soundtracks) because all to often the music is repetitive, or falls flat without the visual aspect of the game/movie to reinforce it. Not true for Fable; the music is solid, dynamic and worth listening to even if you've never played the game. I don't own the game, but after watching a friend play it I was immediately taken with the music. So when I saw the soundtrack for sale I didn't hesitate to pick it up. I haven't regretted it."
4,Great ST for a Great Game,"I love this game so I thought why not get the soundtrack? Overall, this disc is great. There's not a single track I don't enjoy. The overall sound makes me think of Danny Elfman. Fun soundtrack. I listen to this disc often."
5,Invaluable addition for any reference library ...,"""Almanac of African Peoples and Nations promises to be an invaluable addition for any reference library."" Rolin Mainuddin, President of the Association of Third World Studies, North Carolina Central University"
3,"Worth Checking Out: Rumsey's ""Assembling the Shepherd""","Some of these poems are the best I've read in the past six months or so; ""Poem for the Old Year"" and three poems with the same title (""Diagram for Faith"") typify the taut emotional heights Ms. Rumsey's poems are capable of. However, italics are a flourish which should be used sparingly, and their overuse in several of the poems seems offputting, at least to this reader. The poems which succeed best in this collection are the ones that can be understood without the benefit of an Ivy League education, or (to bastardize a poem title of Jorie Graham's) don't fall headlong into the trap of ""What is Called Thinky."" In any case, I look forward to her future books."
4,"a ""Community"" cookbook","Wells wanders around Paris, gathering recipes from her friends, grocers, mentors, and even taxi drivers; that turns out to be fine, since she knows lots of people who cook brilliantly. What's even better is that many of the dishes illustrate the return to long cooking techniques, using less-expensive meats. This is right up my alley -- I'm a braisen' fool -- and so far, I've been happy with everything I've made. One caveat: Wells is no wine expert. Approach her wine pairing recommendations with caution."
4,Somewhat disappointing for the price,"Great recipes as with all of her books, but with far fewer main courses than the total of 150 recipes might lead you to believe. [...]I felt short-changed."
3,so-so Wells,We have several Patricia Wells' cookbooks and thought this would be a nice addition. It is so simplistic that I'm surprised she didn't include a recipe for boiled water. I don't need an haute cuisine text but this book makes Bistro Cooking look like Escoffier.
4,Better and Better,"Jim Trelease's books reviewing and recommending children's literature have improved with each edition since the first Read-Aloud Handbook in 1979. Great gifts for new parents and even grandparents, Trelease's books have always offered guidance into the labyrinth of books written for young children and young readers. From suggestions on how, when, and why to begin reading in utero to guidance for the later elementary child, this book also includes an excellent chapter on curtailing television. which is new from his first editions. My favorite chapter is ""Lessons learned from Oprah Winfrey, Harry Potter, and the Internet."""
5,Wonderful,"Such a great book to understand the importance of reading to your little ones. It is packed full of suggestions, recommended books, and examples of how reading can really change outcomes. Highly recommended for every parent."
2,not what I expected,"too much info on why reading aloud is important and not enough tips, lists, and recommendations (and no stories included)."
2,sad,Unfortunately Mr. Trelease offends Christians and conservatives in his book. Wish I never bought it. Glad I have Honey for a Child's Heart by G. Hunt.
3,Skip to the Index,"The author's point is divine but the book is pretty torturous to read. Too many of his arguments are logically unsound, hyped or just plain wrong. He often makes broad statements based upon a single anecdote. He also overuses endnote references that lend a false gravity to what he's saying. As a result, much of this text reads like one of those ""fake news article"" advertisements you see in magazines from time to time. I found myself so outraged and insulted I was actually LESS compelled to read to my children!*BUT* the book index in the back of the book is worth the money. It also accounts for about a third of the pages.My Advice: Skim Chapter 1. Skip everything else. Use the index in the back to select some wonderful classic books to read to your kids.What a shame that the author of a book about such an important topic has done such an atrocious job of presenting it. I'm disappointed and more than a little troubled."
4,I would have never known,My daughters teacher referred me to this book. It let's you know which books are good to read to your kids at the different age levels. Some books I never read when I was a child. I look forward to reading to my children.
5,Read-Aloud Handbook,"This book well written, easy read. It has so much important information that I will be using for years to come."
5,This book is a game changer,"This book is a must have for all parents, teachers and anyone who values children and reading. If you read to your children, keep doing it...if you don't, start now and don't stop."
5,Forever in my collection,This book is an absolute treasure. Typically I find books like this interesting but boring. I can honestly say I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Trelease definitely knows how to write a book like this and make it worth while. I encourage teachers and parents to read this. You will not be disappointed.
1,Disappointing,"This product was a gift to our son. It taught him that what you see on the box is not always what is in the box. The spinner part is very small compared to pic on box. The car will rarely make it through. After a few attempts, it is now apart destined to never be used again. A very disappointing Hot Wheels purchase."
4,crosman nightstalker,"The Crosman Nightstalker is overall a well built pellet gun. Considering it's made almost entirely of plastic. Even though in the picture givin it looks like metal. But there are some good points.>Very accurate>Light weightDownsides<Very fun to use, but you might get carried away and use all of the CO2 within 30 minutes to an hour.<Uses 88 gram CO2 canister's which are hard to find, and EXPENSIVE when you do find them. (online)Overall well built oh, and good for small game.6/1/12Can use the JT prefilled 90 gram co2 cylinders. which are way cheaper then the crosman airsource 88 gram cylinders and you can buy them at a local walmart for around 14 dollars."
1,dud,This thing died on me within a few weeks. I think it started with the bulletrole getting stuck. Now it just doesn't work anymore ..
1,"You will be very disappointed if you purchase this rifle - Broke in 2.5 minutes , I have 45 years of gun handling and knowledge","This product is cheaply made and will break. 2.5 minute out of the box , a very very thin plastic part which holds the barrel in place after loading broke , the barrel then floats back and forth and gas leaks past , decreased pressure isn't enough to make the pellet leave the barrel , and in a semi auto that means maybe 1 or 2 or 3 pellets lodged in barrlel."
4,Annihilation,"Annihilation of the Wicked is an awesome album. Fans of technical death metal will be salivating at the potent display offered by Nile on this album. It's really heavy, and the stellar production makes it even better. Definitely worth getting."
5,"Pure, Unadulturated, Intelligent Death Metal","This has to be one of the best metal albums I have ever heard, period. There is absolutely no filler, and it never drags or gets boring. While most of the album is very intense, there are a few instrumental interludes here and there for you to take a breather, but make no mistake, if you want some awesome, fast, technical,complex, intellegent metal, than this is your album. If you desire any of those previosly mentioned elements in your music, GET THIS ALBUM NOW!"
5,"So far, this is the best metal album of 2005","For those new to Nile, don't let the opening track fool you. ""Annihilation of the Wicked"" fulfils the promise that was shown on previous albums such as ""Black Seeds of Vengeance"", and finds Nile at their musical apex. ""Cast Down the Heretic"", ""The Burning Pits of the Duat"", and the title track are death metal at it's absolute finest, while ""Lashed to the Slave Stick"" is an instant classic. Guitarist Karl Sanders' epic riffs and solos are among the best in the genre today, and while the Egyptian based lyrics and imagry may wear a bit thin for some, but underneath lies the best band in death metal today. This isn't for the weak hearted who worship Killswitch Engage, Atreyu, and whoever else is calling themselves ""metal"" these days, Nile is the real deal for pure, unadulterated death metal that will make even the most jaded metal heads put the devil ears in the air in sheer joy."
5,Great Brutal Death Metal,"This is a great Nile release, the music is really intense and their are some really good guitar solos. the whole album blew me away. I am looking forward to getting other Nile releases!"
4,This Killer CD just destroys,"This album just shreads completely. These dudes don't play. If you are new to Nile I would suggest giving this a few listens.Again (like most Nile CDs), there are filler tracks IMO but this is definately your typical Nile CD. Probably their best but almost all of their CDs have the good, the bad and the completely pulverizing.The Title track is just ridiculously killer and is one of my favorite Nile tunes. The last track and #4 are also kickin mucho ace."
4,"software is confusing, AKA READ!!!","first off, you may think the software is in the VPAS folder, WRONG! its actually the vikvcc.exe executable.1 run vikvcc.exe2 wait for it to load3 go to user manager4 add user5 do as it says6 your device wont be detected,IMPORTANTplace your scanned finger on the pad, it should automatically ""unlock"" and the computer will detect the flash memorythe drive is smaller than it looks, and the finger-print reader is about the size of your thumb, this is a flat type, which means you dont have to swipe your finger back and forth, i reccomend you wipe the pad after use since it'll leave fingerprints.and veridicom obviously didnt want anyone using their hardware, ive tried this with hp digital persona, and lenovo thnik suit, neither reconize the reader"
2,Below average guide,"I totally agree with all these other reviews. I don't understand how the guide is still selling for so much, really disappointed in bradygames for this guide, they usually do such good game guides. I don't wanna beat the subject to death but yes, several times the guide points you in wrong directions.The only purpose for me to ever buy this guide is because I like collecting guidebooks, alot easier to just go look up online for walkthroughs."
3,"A useful guide, but should have been bigger","Shadow Hearts Covenant is a deep game, aproaching the level one finds with Final Fantasy VII-XII...it deserved a fatter guide book. Nevertheless, I found the guide to be very useful, though flawed. The lack of maps is the number one negative against this guidebook. They would have been especially useful in some of the more complicated sidequest areas, especailly since the walkthrough for these are rudimentary at best. On the plus side, the guide gives pretty good advice for dealing with bosses, and lets you in on most of the secrets, like the location of special items and how to get all of Yuri's fusions, Karin's sword arts, Blanca's wolf bouts, etc. Bottom line, this is a useful guide, but you will probably need to look online for help with some of the sidequests."
2,By far one of the most basic guides i've seen in awhile,"If your thinking of buying this guide, think again. Yes, this guide does contain a ""Walkthrough"" But you can't get any more basic. For example, they neglected to include any sort of maps! The only thing I found useful in this guide was the sidequests section. Its the only redeeming part of the book which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Buy this book only if your a person that loves to complete every nook and cranny, and only if your the type of person who refuses to use an online guide. Did Brady just think Shadow Hearts 2 did not deserve a good guide?Content Ratings: (out of 4)Main Portion, Walkthrough: *Extras, Sidequests: ***Item Index: **Monster Index: **Layout: ***I would buy this guide again if it cost: $4"
2,Guide or No Guide??,"Like the prior reviews stated if you're thinking of buying this guide I'd agree with thinking again. Yeah sure it gives you the side quest information, and boss and monster statistics but umm Hello what good is a Guide WITHOUT! the maps for each area?? Obviously those whom put together this guide didn't think this game deserved a good guide or didn't think they needed to include maps for who knows what reason. I've found many typos in this book as I've used it, some range from little things to not including item information such as weapons that are located in a certain area. But because of the side quest section I did give this a 2 star rating beyond that its really just not that great, I've seen better FAQ guides online from the private person that what I recieved from the company whom designed this guide."
1,Was this guide rushed?,"I agree with the other reviews so far. The author tries to explain which directions to move in certain area of the game. First, this isn't very helpful when the author tells you to move west when the west direction doesn't occur until a few rooms later. Next, the author is very confused with directions. Sometimes right and left are mixed up. I think that even if you do not like reading online guides, you'll enjoy it much more than this guide. The pictures in the guide have no relevance whatso ever. OVerall, its just a rushed guide that is lacking in many ways."
1,"Use an Online FAQ, that's all this is.","Sure this book has everything you need to get through Shadow Hearts II, but since it relies solely on verbal descriptions, you might as well not waste any money for something you can get for free on Neoseeker or Gamefaqs, or some site like that. The only reason I got one is because it was $1.25 at a game shop. $1.25 is cheap enough for me to pay for the convenience of not having to look up a good FAQ, but a price in the teens definitely is not. Don't buy this unless you are an extreme fan who wants to see some repetitive concept art."
2,Not worth the trouble,"I bought the guide on line after I had purchased the game online. I think I paid like $17 and had to wait at least two weeks for it because it was shipped from Switerland!??? When it came in I was so excited because I am a huge SH fan, but when I opened the package and took the book out, I was very dissappointed. I knew there couldn't be much to this guide when it only had roughly 160 pages to it. I mean, the game itself takes at least 50-60 hours to complete, and that's not including the side quests. Sure the guide mentions things I would not have other wise figured out on my own(maybe), but when you're really needing some crucial help, it's not there.I guess buy the guide if you're a big SH fan, you know , just to have, but otherwise, just look up a walk through online and don't waste your money."
3,Shadow Heart: Covenant,Guide was okay--could have used maps and several errors on character locations--i.e. lottery member 6. Item list was inaccurate. I find that most guides have errors.
4,arms and legs dont move,"it is nice for a collection, if you are going to play with it just know that the arms dont change position, they only rotate from the elbow 360 degrees, you cant place it in attack position, but for a collection as stand by it is nice"
3,Great toy,this is an error please remove this review. it is for the wrong product and needs to be removed. it is incorrect. this is not the toy that matches the review. remove this review.
1,Not a fan,"I bought this because the girls at my salon told me it was great. They lied. I kind of hate this lotion. I never see any results. I even bought the level 10 because they said ""ohhh you dont see results because you have to switch them up"", that was a lie too. after 4 visits I started to see my tan slowly come up, but seriously? 4 visits and $80 later I slowly see results? There are soooo many other lotions that I could be using that would make me much darker and they are much cheaper. Oh, the pump sucks too. My pump broke after a month so it was a huge pain in the butt to get out. blahhh! please don't waste your money! Try Love Junkie! I love that product!"
4,"Gay, Sad and Humane","""The beauty of Men"" is a touching, intimate and an uncompromising comment on loneliness and the want of love. The important thing about this book is that it is as much about parenting and ageing as it is about homosexuallity, and that it deals with the universal need for love, be it old, gay or straight. An excellent though painful piece of writing, for any mature reader who has the will and the power to look the beast straight in the eye."
3,Get on with it!,"It's not that I didn't enjoy the story or even the characters but Holleran moped around on the same damn subjects. I understand that ""Becker doesn't love Lark, doesn't even give Lark the time of day"" is like life but wants to wallow in that? Lark's character even says he reads to escape, but we're force fed Lark's whiny pining for a guy who obviously doesn't love him; I've heard enough of that in real life. So, just skim those parts to get to the good parts about Lark's relationship with Joshua, Ernie, Sutcliffe and most importantly, his mother."
2,Spare me the Angst!,"I found nothing at all likable about the protagonist in this anti-fable of gay life. The reader is given no opportunity to dodge as the barrage of self-pity and guilt rains down from the author. The book, however, ends miraculously well. I just wish I hadn't had to sink my boots in all of Holleran's mud. I was really depressed at the picture painted by Holleran, so much so that when the subject of the protagonist's obsession finally confronts and reviles the protagonist, I want to applaud. I too wanted to deny the protagonist from my life, because I, like the obsessee, could feel nothing for the protagonist. If only there was something to learn from this book"
1,Angry or depressed?,"On reading this novel I didn't know whether to be angry or depressed. Does Holleran really hate gay people and gay life so much that he feels impelled to write nearly 300 pages of gloom and doom? If a gay man can feel like this, how can we hope for acceptance from straight people? In the 1960's, a well-known British psychiatry textbook referred to the sad plight of elderly gays, growing old and infirm without the support of wife and kids. This attitude was bad enough then - far worse that Holleran should repeat it ad nauseam in the 90's. I shan't be reading any more of his writing, he's a traitor to the cause."
2,Picture is not the same as shipped,The need to update the picture they have for this product. I order this because I thought it was the old formula because it shows the old style of can. Our local store has the new formula. When we received it it was the new formula in the new can. I could have got this at a local store and save shipping. The product is good but not has good the orginal.
3,Good stuff!,"I like this product and the size of it. Helps me to use more which prevents diaper rash better (why I bought it). For my baby air works better than anything but this ointment is good and thick, so it's a great barrier for nighttime."
3,IT GOT DAMAGE ON THE WAY,"IT GOT DAMAGE ON THE WAY I THINK, I AIN KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO IT, I COULDN'T EVEN SAVE IT"
2,Bring Back the Original Formula,"For those who know the healing magic of the original formula, I invite you to request that the company bring back the original formula with the 50% Lanolin in it. I have included the company contact information from the container and the active ingredients as listed on the original (50% Lanolin formula).CONTACT INFORMATION:Corona Division, Summit Industries, Inc.PO Box 7329Marietta, GA 30065ACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Lanolin 50%, Oxyquinoline 0.11%. Also Contains: Aromatics, Beeswax (yellow wax), petroleum, sodium borate, water.I hope the original formula returns!! The one that works like magic without harming human babies or our blessed fur babies!"
4,Best price for cell phone battery,"This battery was difficult to find in local sources, maybe because the phone is old and has no special features. I searched the internet and when I saw Amazon in the list, I clicked on it.Including shipping, the battery was less than any other source and it is a brand new battery. The delivery time was quick and the packaging was more than adequate."
2,I hope I don't ruin it for you,"I thought this book started off slowly -- I had trouble connecting with the characters, but I kept reading, not in any way forseeing the horrible torture scenes (even worse than Stephen King's ""Misery"") that seemed to have little relevance to the story -- okay, there were some gangsters -- but I was expecting a bullet in the head, maybe, not graphic dismemberment. I had to start skipping those scenes -- too gruesome. I also think that Colin Harrison must feel insecure in his masculinity -- why else would he have two of his male characters perform two-hour sex marathons that leave their partners (who include a female twosome and a nymphomaniac) begging for more? (No I'm not making this up -- pretty pathetic, huh?) Maybe this is a guy type of ""thriller"" -- I don't think I'll be reading this author again."
2,Tragic,"Afterburn was my first Colin Harrison book. You discover quickly that he is a talented writer, and the story starts off with a bang. Unfortunately, the tale degenerates into a web of depressing subplots involving characters whose personal tragedies are almost painful to watch unfold. Everyone's sins come back to haunt them in a big way.With some social commentary from the author leaking through in several places, you begin to wonder if he really has this bleak a view of the human condition. All in all, a well-written book, but you better have a copy of a Dave Barry book nearby to read to recover from the experience."
2,What a shame.,"Afterburn's descriptions and the metaphors Harrison employs are remarkably vivid and unusual. The characters are interesting and well developed, too, and the plot twists were engrossing. The ending, however, was perhaps the most unsatisfying downer I have ever read, and it ruined this otherwise fine book for me. I'm still scratching my head as to how the author (and the reader) could invest so much in a lead character, only to have him meet the fate that's dealt out in this book with infinitely less resourcefulness and results than he (the character) demonstrates in the preceding 400+ pages. I don't demand happy endings, but I don't think that what was done here was true to the character."
2,Don't waste your time,"Although there are some graphic as well as moving segments,overall this novel is poorly edited, often having abrupt transitions. It drags on and on in places and,plainly,isn't that interesting (altho it TRYS to be). I'd find a good 5 star mystery (there's lots) and not waste your time."
1,Cut it in half,"You don't have to literally tear the book in half, the editor should have done this for you. Second book of his that I could not finish. So much fluff and unnecessary dialog and blandness. Just when you think the story is picking up you get thrown back in to the drivel of the characters. The author doesn't let you feel anything for these people. You try and care about the characters in the book but it just doesn't happen. I really wanted to like this book but in the end I just couldn't stand it anymore and had to get rid of it. Just my opinion but unless there is nothing else left out there to read, I wouldn't bother."
5,Listen to the professional reviewers,"Listen to what the real critics - especially Booklist - had to say about Colin Harrison's ""Afterburn"" and ignore the few negative and misguided reviews that have been posted here.This is one of the very best thrillers/mystery novels to have been published in 2000: witty, supremely intelligent,and crafted by a pro. ""Afterburn"" was one of only a small handful of titles this past year that kept me compulsively reading long after it should have been lights out. Don't miss a truly great read!"
1,What a horrible waste....,"Very few of the books that I buy do I not finish. This was one of them. Terribly formulaic in that dark 90's sort of way, off-putting in its bleakness without any kind of redeeming balance. Try Thomas Harris if you like that sort of tale; one winds up strangely admiring his Dr. Lecter. While Charlie in this novel is not the same kind of character, he winds up being disappointingly pathetic. A good review of this book prompted me to buy it sight unseen - an awful mistake. Truly a 0 star."
2,eloquent and hateful,"He writes well, has obviously done loads of research, but three graphic torture scenes involving saws, dismemberment, etc.? A very ugly and joyless book."
1,A Waste of Paper and Time,"I am at a complete loss as to how anyone could have liked this book. ....The author goes through great lengths to set up these characters and their lives (hundreds of pages of overly descriptive prose about asian finance, artifical ensemination and retirement homes), and all for absolutely no reason. Almost none of it had any bearing what-so-ever on the story or ultimately on the fate of the characters. ...."
2,disappointing,This book was a starred selection in People magazine. I eagerly set to reading...but lost interest along the way. Torture and sex scenes were uninhibitedly graphic and disturbing. The conclusion was unsatisfying. A let down.
2,"Slick, Hollow, and Forgettable","A well written, yet uninspired novel. The sex and violence don't mean much because the characters don't seem quite real enough. They're certainly not likeable. And in the end it's just the usual mafia bad guys torturing and killing. How un-original! Two stars only because the writing is strong."
3,A Page-Turner with Silly Sex,"I loved Bodies Electric, also by Colin Harrison. It was one of the best books I've ever read. Manhattan Nocture seemed a bit over the top, and the trend continues here. Still, I stayed up late to finish it. The one thing that made me nearly stop reading it were the silly sex scenes, featuring multi-orgasmic women and men with incredible stamina. The worst was when two prostitutes were arguing over whoe got to have sex (again) with a character - you see, they loved his ability to maintain an erection for hours. Uh huh."
1,Do NOT buy this book!,"The ONLY reason I bought this book was that it had beenrecommended as the ""Page Turner of the Week"" in PeopleMagazine. It was a page turner because I kept thinking it HAD to get better -- it didn't. The book was sex (described in the most lewd, crude ways), torture (a REPEATED event throughout the book) and dismemberment. I am angry that I wasted my time and money, and want to know WHO planted the recommendations for this book. I will not be buying any more of this author's books. END"
1,Burning is too good for this book!,"I didn't waste much money on this .25 for the record, but the time is another thing. I can't think of one redeeming quality in this book. I guess bad guys always win? One reader asked wonder what vets think of this. The part that covered his military service was just the prologue so not much to base an opinion on. I do wish I had read these reviews first as this book certainly left a bad taste in my mouth. How it gets the raves printed on the first couple pages is a mystery to me."
3,Depressing and ultimately pointless,"I wish I could say that I liked this book. Harrison is obviously a talented writer and his characterizations are excellent. This story however was unsatisfying and ultimately pointless, not to mention depressing. The violence was pointless and did not seem to add tot he plot such as it was. The sex scenes seemed overly graphic for this type of book - it is supposed to be a thriller.I enjoyed many of the character developments as well as the basic premise, but the book seemed to ramble too long before getting to the critical story elements.The ending was a total downer and blew away any expectations I had. The author madfe such a strong point about Charlies toughness and ability to survive, yet......Sorry I cannot recommend this book. I found myself wishing this was a DVD and had an ""alternate ending"" in the bonus material."
4,an experience,"I differ with most of the readers who have reviews here. I found the book to be engrossing and thought provoking. In my little Midwestern world, I often find myself shaking my head at the lives and choices of others. This novel gave some glimpses into what might be the driving forces behind some of the horrfic news items of our times. I like to think humanity is not depraved, when obviously it is, sometimes. There are human beings who torture and kill others. Reading ""over the top"" stories like this one are educative. I am glad I read the book. Wonder what Vets think of it?"
1,My first review. Driven by disappointment.,"I have never taken the time to review a book on Amazon before, but felt compelled to save another reader from this boring read. While ninetey percent of the book is spent on character development, I never felt a connection with, nor sensed realism in any of the characters. All of this lead to a whimper of an ending. Save your money, and your time."
3,Hannibal Lecter meets A Man In Full,"If Tom Wolfe and Thomas Harris were to collaborate on a novel, the result would probably look something like ""Afterburn."" Harrison shares Wolfe's knowledge of the world of the super rich and writes about their wheelings and dealings with just about as much verve and flair. And in the villainous Morris, a freelance amateur surgeon, he has created a character who makes Hannibal Lecter seem downright humane. Your worst nightmare will seem like a relief compared to some of the more ghastly scenes in ""Afterburn."""
2,A Disappointing Follow-Up to Nocturne,"After devouring Manhattan Nocturne, I was eager to read Harrison's next book. But I found it lacking. The characters came off as shallow and unsympathetic. While the plot moved along, at times it was jarring, with the action moving from one character to another. Some story lines were picked up and dropped. In places, the book was extremely gory, unnecessarily so. One scene in particular, where one character is brutally mutilated, was hard to get through. At the end of the book I felt cheated, that I had spent many hours with these characters and didn't feel anything for them, except perhaps distaste."
5,Nice Surprise,"I found this book in a bargain book shop in Auckland, New Zealand and couldn't have enjoyed it any more. The end of the novel does a great job of both pulling together the characters and the plot but also plugging the holes in the story that I initially found unrealistic. The author does an impressive job of building together characters that are indeed multi-dimensional and believable. Few people are truly ""good"" or universally ""bad"" and Colin Harrison's main characters are both likable and realistic. The ending was neither dissapointing nor predictable."
2,A sorry introduction to this author,"After hearing good things about Colin Harrison I was looking forward to reading this novel (my first by him)...what a waste! I was tempted to put it down several times (particularly after the first torture scene) but hung on hoping things would improve. Unfortunately, additional gratuitous torture scenes were the reward. There is some good character development but it was just too grisly for me."
3,well written and overrated,"This is a well written, silly and finally predictable story. All Harrison seems intent on doing is following in the tracks of the other recent gruesome-meisters by attempting to horrify us with his very own version of Hannibal Lector. But in the end AFTERBURN is neither Thomas Harris NOR Auchincloss as one reviewer(inappropriately)put it. I also have a not-so sneaking suspicion Harrison would not have gotten the publicity for the book that he has if he weren't the editor of Harper's Magazine. I mean, how many thrillers do you see blurbed by David Foster Wallace?"
1,A throwaway,"I too did not finish this book. It had a compelling start, but soon fell into needless gratuitous sex and violence. Certainly isn't worth any media praise it received. I never throw books away, but this one found its way to the trash bin. Wouldn't want anyone I respect finding it in my library."
2,Intriguing Characters Treated Badly,"Harrison is a writer of considerable ability who, in Afterburn, has drawn interesting characters with great potential. But reader beware, its unlikely you will be satisfied with the direction the story takes them. Even jaded as I am, I was deeply disturbed by the action described. As some books are a 'good read', this is a 'bad read', not due to poor writing but because of the unpleasant events depicted. I compare this book to the awful 'Hannibal' in the graphic torture described, and although Afterburn is the far better crafted book, I'm still sorry I read it and cannot recommend."
2,Pure Torture,"Take away the sex and violence in this book and what have you got--not much. It's interesting to read the literary reviews of the book--i.e., Afterburn raises the thriller to a new level. A new level of what, moral degredation? Funny thing is I'm a real Clive Barker fan and I couldn't read a lot of this book because it was meaninglessly disturbing. Makes one wonder why anyone would write a book like this."
4,Not for the faint of heart,"Afterburn is my first exposure to this author, and I can see why this novel generates the strong sentiments, both positive and negative, that it has. Let's start with the obvious-Colin Harrison is a brilliant writer and Afterburn is a daring book. It is not your average cookie-cutter feel good run-of-the-mill thriller. And that's the problem for the people who hated it. The sex, the violence and the torture are all so vividly portrayed that you shrink away from the words even as you read them. But if you're daring, and if you can appreciate the word smithing that underpins Afterburn, then you'll enjoy it. If not, you'll hate it. I came down firmly in the enjoy/admire category."
2,"Mr. Harrison, why?","Dear Mr. Harrison, you are obviously a talented and skilled writer. The opening chapter describing the life of a bomber pilot in Vietnam was quite compelling and really drew me in. But after investing my time and money what was my reward? Over the top, gratuitous violence. I have no objection to a torture scene, but yours were just sick for the sake of being sick. Same for your sex scenes. It's fine to write about, but why beat us over the head with it unless it advances the story? I am very sure that you could create a literary and artistic piece of work but you took a jack-hammer to the piano. Not to mention the fact that the three main characters were a greedy, vindictive, unsympathetic lot. There really wasn't anyone to root for by the end, so why not just kill 'em all? Signed, me"
5,Ed Ames CD,"My husband was online listening to Ed Ames. So I thought that I would try to see if I could get online and purchase a CD for him at Christmas time. The results were fantastic!!!We received the CD in record time and have been listening to the CD ever since. Our children are not thrilled to listen to Ed Ames, but a little bit of good music never hurt a person!!! They will alway remember their Dad giving the toast at their sister's wedding and letting EVERYONE know that he listens to ED AMES and ACDC....LOLIf you love classic timeless music this is the CD to buy. You will not be disappointed!!!"
5,The Very Best of Ed Ames,"One of the great voices of the past. So glad someone decided to re-release this deep resonant voice that many of us remember just as one of the songs ""Try to Remember"". Wonderful listening."
3,Wonderful Ed Ames!,"This cd displays the magnificent voice of Ed Ames. He is one of thefinest singers I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. Ames ranksup there with the best. Though he hadn't recorded very many songs inhis solo career, they are still memorable. Folks growing up during thesixties will enjoy this collection."
5,"Very deadly, very desirous","It may not be worth price, but it was pretty thrilling. It was like The Thomas Crown Affair, but with a twisted murder plot."
3,"Some good parts, but . . .","I liked the book's explanations of the WSH and FSO object hierarchies but it was short on details when it comes to common scripting practices such as passing and securing script parameters, scheduling jobs, and using constants. I did not find the section on ADO very useful because I had to consult additional references to get my code to work."
2,Very helpful...but...,"As a beginning scripter, I was able to take a great deal from Peter's book. However, as I progressed, I started to get distracted by the number of typos and errors throughout. While leaving off an ""s"" is not the end of the world, I found more than one occasion where the sample programs would not run correctly due to an out-of-place or omitted character. As a first-time programmer, I'm pretty much putting all my faith in Mr. Aitken over there, and by the end of the book I was almost suprised when something worked. So, yeah, nice little book for the novice, but the errors range from innocent to kind of severe."
5,A BRIDE'S BEST FRIEND,"Marsha Heckman is the most original, romantic bridal designer in the U.S. I've seen most bridal and wedding books, and Marsha's (this one and BOUQUETS) really cut through a lot of the stuff we see everywhere else. A BRIDE'S BOOK helps a woman create a unique, personal wedding that's true to her own style. It doesn't hurt that the photos are gorgeous too."
1,Dissapointing,"I was expecting *guidance* on planning my wedding, and got a contact sheet for all of the people involved. This book is simply a place to write down names, addresses, and other info of the vendors and people involved in your wedding. There is a to do timeline, but otherwise no planning tips. And when it says ""full color photos"", it means 7 full color photos of the bouquets. Thats it, because the rest has no tips, just information sheets. I have all of that info on the contracts I signed, so I don't see a need to have it in more than one place. It has a ""journal"" as a keepsake, but it is just a bunch of empty pages for you to write in. I could have MADE a better binder, and that is what I did. I threw this out and made my own."
3,A Bride's Book,This was helpful. There are so many out there it's really hard to choose. We were happy with our choice
5,excellent,This bridal book is one of the best for helping in the organization of putting the wedding all together. I highly recommend this for any future bride or as a gift for the organized bride.
4,Quality Product,"I found this to be the quality and content that I was looking for. You cannot have too much detail in a wedding planner book. I found the companion a ""Bride's Book of Lists"" helpful as well."
5,Perfect for a Bride's Keepsake!!!,"I look forward to Jotting down every moment of planning the ""big day"" and all the days leading up to my wedding. It will be so wonderful to look back! This is the perfect book to write down all those wonderful memories in."
3,don't bother,It is all common sense and what every other wedding book offers. I find that it was a waste of money and space.
5,Bonza goods,Bought for my daughters upcoming wedding and she loves the book - reckons that its the tops - she happy - we happy!
3,Jungle Animal Set,The animals came today. You will only get 8 animals. You will only get 1 monkey and 1 lion. You do not get the all the animals in the picture.
5,I think this might be my favorite Danny Dunn book.,"Danny, loooooooong preceeding ""Neuromancer"", dons a helmet and gloves which give him sensations from an outside source--in this case, a mechanical dragonfly. He uses this technology to his own ends, of course. Prescient sci-fi from the team of Williams and Abraskin."
2,"Buy for history, NOT for tips on how to play craps","I bought Mr. Stuart's book to learn from his 50 years at craps. I was disappointed with the guidance offered as the vague info could be summarized on a matchbook cover. I gave 2 stars for the interesting anecdotal info on the history of Vegas, but if you're trying to learn how to play READ SOMETHING ELSE. Historically, I've purchased 5 books, and have practiced methods and the best books to read are John Patrick's Advanced Craps book or Craps, the Real Deal : A Guide to Craps Strategy by Vogel. These books cover detailed money management, strategies/systems, charting a table, etc. The book by Frank Scoblete is also good, and different as to offer another strategy."
1,Save your money,Save your money. This book is a waste of time for craps strategy. Agree 100% with review that this is nothing more than humorous(?) stories. And not even funny at that!
5,Winning at Craps,"This is a really good book about craps and the neat story of the game. the dice themselves, the characters that built the business and, most importantly, how to win. It is VERY entertaining and VERY well written. The book is about 2/3 fun history and nostalgia and about 1/3 how to play to win. If you have any interest in gambling craps you will love this book. It is a fast read...three hours...and I could not put it down!"
3,Good charger... no so good battery,"If you have multiple batteries and would like an external charge, this one works pretty well, but the battery that came with it only lasted a few months before it died on me."
1,not for slim,"when i purchased this about a month ago the page said SLIM, but this is most definately not a psp slim battery or charger. Infact, not only does the battery not fit, it isn't even compatible at all. the contacts are at a differnt height making the battery not work on the slim, and the slim battery not fit in the charger. love my psp, but seriously sony give up on the propiatary **** already. you need the customers.Also, blue LED's are starting to get old. between my speakers and my usb hub its hard to sleep. This one has one too, guess its not to bad that its totally useless for me :P"
1,No power supply!,I'm really disappointed to receive the charger and battery without any power supply! What good is a charger without any way to plug it in?
5,I really like this book!!,"This book is very insightful on both, aspects of tourism and travel, as well as the financial affects that tourism can play on a country's economy. The authors seem to know what they're talking about and they're very good at relaying their knowledge to their readers in a concise way."
2,Wrong book,I purchased the product from a different merchant instead of directly through amazon and received the wrong addition. It may have been my fault since I did not re-click on the link provided in my cart to verify the item.
3,Not as good as I had heard,"I was a little disappointed in this movie. I kept hearing that this version of Dracula was the best. I think that it could have been a lot better. I think it definitely is one for the library if you are a hardcore Dracula film buff, but I don't think the average Joe would enjoy it too much."
4,"Dracula - in disguise as David Copperfiled, magician","Once I got over the shock of how like the magician David Copperfield this 70's Dracula looked, with his flowy white shirt, tight black pants, blowdried and hairsprayed hair, I actually enjoyed the movie. Definitely made in the Hammer genre -women in flowy white dresses, overacting in the van helsing role from Laurence Olivier, too much mist and plastic bats -all this adds to the atmosphere - but the biggest surprise was that Frank Langella in the title role brings a sensuous sexiness to his Dracula, never quite achieved by good old Christopher Lee"
4,dark child of vampires impressed,"it's amazing that langella doesn't once use fake fangs in the movie, yet still completely manages to emulate the count (based of course on vlad dracula/vlad tepes/vlad the impaler) in both bloodthirsty nature against enemies and noble public image. his acting style bridges the gap between the fictional count dracula and the real prince dracula of walachia. although the other actors/actresses also performed magnificently in their roles, the special effects were by no means able to compete with modern technology, yet the theatrical-style performances by all actors (langella mostly) gave the film a much more truthful sense to it. i must admit that despite the special effects found in modern renditions, i tend to still prefer this older version of dracula as the most ""realistic"" portrayal and closest interpretation of the real dracula portrayed as the fictional count. my thanks to langella for his (again, counting theater)entrancing performance as the count."
4,"It's not Bram Stoker, but it's an interesting revision...","...of Stoker's classic horror story. This version takes liberties galore with Stoker's plot, but the cast is excellent, and Frank Langella is absolutely devastating as Dracula -- diabolical, mesmerizing, incredibly erotic (I wanted to leave my window open so he could fly in) -- and the plot twists are an interesting reworking of the original. I wasn't too satisfied with the ending, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. This Dracula is definitely worth seeing."
4,"Stylish; Slow Paced, By-the-Numbers Script","Remember being impressed with this film when it debuted, however its 79 release put it (just barely)in an earlier era of mainly straightforward, by-the-numbers scripts with no surprises. The bonus feature interviews of Langella and director Badham are very interesting. One of them has the opinion that George Hamilton's ""Love at First Bite"" Dracula spoof, which came out earlier in the summer of 79, hurt thisfilm.This movie does a good job of projecting the proper atmosphere, it just doesn't seem as good as it did in 79."
3,"Good, but the play was better","I saw an airing of this on tv (way back when!) that was a filming of the stage production. It was probably the best version of Dracula I've seen, so when I ran across this on LD years ago, I was ecstatic to get it, only to be disappointed that it was nowhere near the experience. It's probably still my favorite Dracula rendition, and I'm planning on getting the DVD, but I'd really rather get the stage production version..."
1,"Over-rated, overlong .. and unfaithful to the book","Despite some simpering reviews, mostly on the star qualities of Langella and Olivier, this is really a fairly bad movie. Slow, ponderous, changes from Stoker's for no visible reason, and generally wooden performances form the actors.Much has been made of the fact that the movie was overshadowed at release by Nosferatu the Vampyr and even Love At First Bite - if it wasn't for them, the lovie argument goes, this film would have shone. Well actually, if it was overshadowed, perhaps the critics should ask why.Nosferatu featured a monstrous Dracula, who happened to be more sensuous than Langella, who camped it up as much as Love At First Bite - but without the comedy to go with it.Had they stuck to the story, they'd at least have that in their favour ... as it is, it's just one more lumpen movie."
5,the Dracula !!!,"While not strictly accurate to the original book, it manages to capture the feel of it in a way that the later films did not. Even if you are not a horror fan do give this a try. It is not that gory but it is very well acted and Langella is perfect as Dracula - even better than Lee !!"
4,"""One Of The Best Versions!""","Frank Langella, Laurence Olivier, Kate Nelligan and Donald Pleasencestar in John Badham's 1979 horror remake. A seductive vampire biteshis way through London. Frank is amazing as Dracula and Laurencewas great as Van Helsing. John Williams also did great as alwayswith the music and this dvd has good picture and sound plus acouple neat extras. I highly recommend this because it's oneof the best versions."
1,Draclua VHS,"I thougth when I purchased it it could be in color, but no, it`s just like the DVD, horrible in black and white. John Badham deserves to be punished for have ruined a wonderful film."
3,Great Film,I love Laurence I think he is beautiful. The sound was a little off but other than that a great watch for a rainy day.
5,The First Romantic Dracula,This was the first truely romantic Dracula movie made. It gets the story across without drowning you in a sea of blood. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who is into vampire movies. However it is more of a chick flick.
3,Entertaining,"One of the better Dracula movies. A classic horror movie with an actual story... before all of the gore of the slasher genre. Cheesy 70's special effects, but overall good."
3,"A very romantic, though not frightening, rendition","While not scary in the least, Frank Langella does give an elegant, three dimensional, and the most seductive rendition of the UnDead Count yet. Watch closely and you'll see a twist in the movie, in that, this time, it is not Dracula who's the villain, but, in some ways, his pursuers. The women he seduces appear in danger-they're enjoying it and are being ""rescued"" from the confines of the stiff Edwardian Age. This version anticipates the Coppola version of the 90's, which made turned the bloodthirsty Count into an Undead pursurer of lost love. Though as far from Bram Stoker's original conception of the Count as an ancient, bestial warlord, Langella does elevate the character to classical status in his interpretation. Also, noteworthy is the photography and production design. A real treat for any Dracula or vampire fans."
3,""" I need.....I need""- Dracula","Ok, so this isn't exactly the most scariest Dracula movie, but perhaps this is the most romantic. Frank Langella ( sp?) takes the role of the infamous Dracula and does a pretty good job. One thing I liked about Frank's performance was his eyes, he has very mysterious-like eyes that draws you right in. Dracula in this movie is much more romantic and this time instead of Mina, he goes for her friend, Lucy. Laurence Oliver would starr as the ever loving Van Helsing. While Donald Loomis would starr as Doctor Seward.The DVD quality is nice and clear like usual, and the sound is a little hard to hear at some times. The DVD also includes some good special features which is a treat for anyone who enjoys this movie. Feature commentary by Director John Badham. "" The Revamping of Dracula "" which includes interviews by the cast, director, producer, and composer, John Williams. Recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie straightly about Dracula's romantic side."
2,Are you serious,I thought this movie was ridiculous. I remember waiting for this movie to come out years back with great anticipation but forgot how ludicrous it was until I watched it again just recently. Sorry I wasted the money.
3,Retelling,"This film is a retelling of the classic Dracula vampire myth with most of the main characters intact- Dracula himself, Harker, Mina, Lucy and Van Helsing. It was a decent film."
2,Where's the color?,"The color is so washed-out that the film is very disappointing. I have liked the movie over the years, but this DVD leaves much to be desired. The video tape is a better viewing even though it is not widescreen."
5,Mesmerizing,"Frank Langella was mesmerizing as the blood thirsty count Dracula. He played the role to perfection. Kate Nelligan as Lucy was just icing on the cake. She and Langella lit up the screen! The gothic, chilling landscapes, brilliant perforances, and wonderful music score make this move a MUST for all true Dracula fans! Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
4,"Frank Langella can put the bite on me, anytime.",Frank Langella is wonderful in this role. I can't think of another actor who could do a better job. Any shortcomings in the script or direction are simply not noticed.
2,Do not be tricked about this movie.,"Please, to everyone thinking about buying this title, to all Dracula fans I say Do not be tricked in buying this Dracula movie 'cos you will be really really sorry...Believe Me...But if you like thriller & dramatic movies, then try it..."
1,"where is it??? been a month and still not here, and they won't do anything about it","i am very mad at this company. i bought this a month a go, and it still is not here, and they will not do anything about it. according to amazon the delivery date was 2 weeks, but then after you purchase it, they send an email to tell you it could take up to 6 weeks. false advertisment, and i can't even get my money back... i suggest not buying from this company"
2,"scared me as a child,but it seams very creaky and tired today","in 1979 i saw this movie when it was released and it scared me to death,so when it came out on dvd i bought it,but something has changed(maybe i grew up) but now the movie seams flat and the cast looks like they are sleepwalking through the movie.frank langella is good as the count but the movie is so off that the good job is lost in the hopeless script and mindless direction. all in all wasted chance."
3,"Lugosi, Jourdan, Palance, Lee si; Langella, no","I have seen many versions of Dracula; many have various qualities to recommend them; I cannot understand why so many people gave Langella's performance such high ratings-just because he is so romantic--read the book-Dracula is alluring, tempting, enticing, but not romantic. Langella lacks Lugosi's determination, Jourdan's terror, Palance's strength, and Lee's menace. Granted a good supporting cast, Anthony Hopkins version of Van Helsing was a spoof--FFC should have been wacked for labeling his abomination ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". Langella version is ok but not great.Then again, there will be no definitive Dracula, until I make it!"
4,Film actually has funny moments,"Like when Lucy in the last scene starts blinking her eyes a lot. I chuckled at that one. Also, when Jonathon Harker scares Lucy in the middle of the night for a joke it's rather humorous as well.And you hear the old goofy line by Drac ""I never drink---wine""."
1,The Play Was 100% Better!,"I saw the wonderful Play Dracula that this movie was based on or should I say loosely based on? This incredibly bad movie is nothing like the wonderful play that was a mixture of horror and humor with clever and witty dialogue, I saw this Dracula movie with Frank Langella thinking it would be a mixture of horror and wit like in the play but I was very disappointed, it wasn't the same story at all! I hope someday someone decides to really make a movie version of the play and makes it the way it is supposed to be, spooky and witty and excatly like the play. Even a filmed version of the actual play would be great!"
3,Dracula,I LOVE this movie-but the DVD i received skipper/as well as completely stopped 4 minutes from the climactic ending. I still highly recommend it.
5,FRANK MAKES A SEDUCTIVE DRACULA!!!!,"This movie is very good.it has its violence,and it has its love and romance.This for a die hard Dracula fan and a drama fan.Frank Langella,stars as the dreadful,yet suductive Count Dracula,he travels the world searching for his love.Laurence Oliver stars as vampire hunter Van Helsing who hunts the undead blood lovers down,and Kate Helligan plays the role of a young beauty who becomes Dracula's desire.Along with a great cast and story,this is Dracula as you never seen him.And once you have seen Dracula,you'll never forget it!"
2,"Horrible washed out Drac, shame on you Universal!","Wonderful movie but the color transfer is pathetic, and don't say that's the way it was, I saw it on screen when released and have the VHS and the color was/is vibrant and bright, hell even the ads at the time read ""In Full Color"". This 2004 DVD version is an injustice to the movie and it's loyal fans. Shame on you Badham if you made Universal do a new color palette and shame on you Universal for releasing such a vapid copy of a wonderful genre film. I'll stick with my pan and scan VHS copy until someone releases this puppy the way it was first born!"
1,COLORS STILL WASHED OUT,"a 5 STAR MOVIE, WHEN I FIRST SAW IT AND HAD IT ON VHS, THEN THE TRANSFER TO DVD WASHED OUT THE COLORS (BY REQUEST OF THE DIRECTOR) RUINED THE MOVIE.."
5,dracula,It's a story of good and evil. This is a great movie about love that never dies. Frank makes the character of Dracula come to life. this is a movie that I can watch over and over. This version of the classic is a lot more sensual than some. I give this a 5 star movie.
5,this was one of the best version's of Dracula,"This movie by far was one of the best version's of Dracula made in the 80's. Langella was a perfect Dracula, both in appearance and in speech. He truely brought the image of Dracula alive. It has become a must in my vampire collection"
3,"Good film, appalling transfer...","I've owned this DVD since around 1999, and it is by far the worst transfer in my collection (the old DVD release of ""Blade Runner (The Director's Cut"" comes up a distant second). Jaggies everywhere, the coloration is bizarre and, it looks bad even on a standard 25 inch TV set. IMO this DVD is well overdue for a re-release giving it the attention it deserves. This one looks like somebody sorta randomly twiddled the dials on a digitizer and drop-kicked the film into the machine.Fun movie though -- this is my favorite version of ""dracula."" I like the Gary Oldman version as well, but not as much as this one. Frank Langella really has fun with his role, hamming it up... if you can get past all the jaggies, digital nasties and utter lack of features (the main menu is the chapter selection screen), you'll probably enjoy it a lot."
4,"Fascinating, but Troubling","I can't remember the last time that a book both fascinated and disturbed me as deeply as this book. The premises that James Morrow pushes in this book - that God is ultimately responsible for the evil in the world is not new. As Morrow explains in his book, this question has its roots in the Book of Job and has been addressed by history's greatest theologians. What separates Morrow from his predecessors is his cataloguing of history's horrors, perpetrated on both societies and individuals. And this catalog is very disquieting. Ultimately, I disagree with Morrow's ultimate position, but I very much respect his writing and his penetrating attacks upon traditional theological justifications for the existence of evil in a society created by an all-knowing and all-loving God."
2,Imagination meets ridiculousness,"When imagination fulminates too hard, it turns into drivel and this author got to that point. I guess ""god satires"" aren't for everyone, but it all seemed like a sophomore essay in a land where the sophomores have hairy tails and ears and mark trees to denote their territory. James Morrow has marked his territory and now I don't want to go into that area of the forest."
5,Morrow is unforgetable,"This is my favorite book, and i was sad to see it end. I had read Towing Jehova, and didn't expect this the surpass it, but it did. I haven't seen such a gritty look at religion since Mark Twain's ""Letters From Earth"" (another favorite of mine). No sides are taken in this all out battle between victims and supporters of God."
4,Review By A Fellow Singer,Im a pop singer myself and i first saw these guys on the Jenny Jones show. and i must say when they performed the song Nina Bonita i was in awe. I am not too big on latin style music but these guys are very talented and they changed my opinion!
5,A great mix of rythm from 5 young artists,I love the CD.. it has a mixture of rythms that make you stand up and dance with them. I really recommend the album to anyone who likes artists like Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez.. They are great! Buying this album was the best thing I have done... I play it again and again in my car... and I love it!
2,Magic of the Night,"Well, the only good song is Magic of the Night (which, by the way, is the theme song for the show Destination Stardom on PAX TV). Apparently, Jyve's fame was found on a similar show but their music has yet to be improved. That's the only track I really like, the others are so-so."
3,Reasonable,A well recorded yet prosaic reading (although by superb musicians) of one of the monuments of the repertoire.
5,Fun for Lovers of the Game,"Fun, Enjoyable and Fast..... You could read whenever you feel like with no pressure of forgetting what happened... Different People with different Things... Big Names....... FUN FOR LOVERS OF THE GAME Patrick is great as usual...fun and Loving]"
5,NON-STOP SPORTS HUMOR,"TO ANYONE WHO HAS EVER LISTENED TO THE DAN PATRICK SHOW ON ESPN RADIO, THIS IS A TERRIFIC COMPANION BOOK. DAN'S WIT AND AMAZING INTERVIEW STYLE JUMPS RIGHT OFF THE PAGE AT YOU. IT IS SO MUCH MORE THAN ANY OF YOUR AVERAGE SPORTS INTERVIEWS. HE COMBINES WIT AND WISDOM TO MAKE THIS AN AMAZING READ"
1,changing area too short,"I bought this without looking at the dimensions, assuming all changing tables would be long enough for babies until ~3 years old. My baby is 1 month and is almost too big for the table. Don't buy it!"
5,"Good lord, what a movie...","Walter Matthau's final speech in this movie could be played tomorrow and might be more current than it was in 1957, but that's secondary to the overall quality.This movie is a staggering achievement on any objective level. Andy Griffith puts up an acting portrayal that really has to be seen to be believed, and it's a true shame it's not better known. There are movies that make a viewer stand up and take notice. Citizen Kane, On The Waterfront, The Godfather...This movie is at minimum their equal, and not to be overly hyperbolic, a superior to many movies we regard as classics. ""A Face in the Crowd"" is why movies are worth watching."
3,It's OK,"Yes, a 1950's film I guess this was hard core back then (shocking?) not so much now but over all well rounded film even for today."
5,Wow what a performance!,I had no idea Andy Griffith had ever pulled off a performance this powerful and to think this was his first time on film. What an amazing picture that covers the subject of public influence and manipulation through television and the way power can change a man. This is an epic story of the rise and fall of a man. Take advantage of this finally being available on DVD and rent it now.
4,time is the only critic that matters - still relevant today.,"Kazan solid as usual, and Griffith like you could not fathom. stiffed in the oscars for whatever reason who knows. Things have not changed a bit. Think of the quacks who hold sway in media today and enduring issues will turn you into H L Mencken regarding the common man. Why are people so susceptible to manure?. If the sheep would only turn off rush, american idol and the avengers maybe a movie like this would make them wonder- nah who i am kidding"
4,Andy Griffith's different face,"Following Griffith's death in 2012, I made a note to see him in this movie. I had grown accustomed to the 'Andy from Mayberry' and, therefore, could not envision his plausible portrayal of a hard drinking drifter. Wow, I was blown away. Griffith pairs well with Paticia Neal in a rags to riches tale depicting a talented man haunted by his own insecurities and image.This movie is for any Griffith fan who wants to see his full acting capability and a very different face. The movie storyline held my attention and provided a splash of history and culture from the late 1950's, as well as showcasing TV's early power and influence on the masses.The movie is in black and white but, for me, the lack of color seemed to compliment a dark theme. Watch it and see if you do not identify a few modern day 'Lonesome Rhodes.'"
5,Two-faced Andy,"Andy Griffith absolutely astounded me with this role as a loud mouth, rude and selfish southerner. He kept my attention glued on his every unpredictable fits of rage then calm; never really knowing which personality would dominate the finally. His willingness to throw himself into his first film gave a glimpse of his talent on both ends of the acting spectrum. He will always be the guy from Mayberry, but for one moment he really showed he could bring drama to a new level. Andy, you are sorely missed. R.I.P.!"
3,JUMP!!!,"whoa what a firehouse performance, completely unexpected, and wildly entertaining, Griffith blew the lid off pretentiousness and presented a role with great depth... commanding attention at every turn, the reveal is such a horror but nonetheless an all too prevalent force ubiquitous in todays media... was surprised at how talented Remick is esp with the batons!!! assume many have known this personality and were drawn to it with negative consequences and how to tame such an ego, essentially begging them to JUMP to allow others to survive the savage rage, if you are fortunate, and this film permits such redemption..."
4,Great movie!,This is one of those movies that are so ahead of its time. Imagine predicting the rise of Glen Beck in the late '50s!
5,Everyone should see this.,"There are so many truths--hidden and not hidden in this extraordinary film about a guy who is truly a ""nothing"" becoming powerful enough to influence a presidential election.The way he manipulates the public will remind you of Bill Clinton. The fact that he's a complete zero will remind you of George W. Bush.This is really trivia in a movie this important but what a revelation that Andy Griffith started his career as a brilliant actor! What a shame he spent the rest of his career at the level of a Don Knotts or a Jerry VanDyke. The next time I see an actor who is truly awful I'll consider that maybe the right part just hasn't come along."
3,My grandma was in this movie..,"I hadn't seen this movie, until a couple of months ago.My grandma had a little part in the movie, so I purchased one for her, and one for me.She only had a little part in it, but I still treasure this DVD."
3,Weird and Freakish,"A weird and freakish Andy Griffith as an evil n'eer do well with a talent for ingratiating himelf with the public as a folksy singer and ""down to earth"" raconteur. Patricia Neal looks hot! Overall, this film is kind of corny, creepy and a little draggy, but has some nostalgia value."
3,Timeless Message,"Seeing this film once was enough for me. Andy Griffith is completely obnoxious. He laughed, screamed and hollered so much it got on my nerves. Maybe a character like that could become a huge success with the public in the 1950s, but I don't believe he could now.Aside from that, this movie has a message that may seem old to us now, but is timeless nonetheless. Lonesome Rhodes is discovered in a local jail. His hokey, aw-shucks, down home manner of speaking turns him into a national icon. He has tremendous influence. He brings a lady onto his television show whose house has just burned down, and the money starts pouring in. Haven't we all heard this type of situation before?The later part of the movie Rhodes was advising a politician on how to get votes. I couldn't help but think of Bill Clinton. In fact, Lonesome Rhodes reminded me of Bill Clinton during this part of the movie. Mr. Manipulation.I haven't given away the ending. See it for yourself."
2,Not the best choice for intermediate OS X users,"Probably not the best choice for someone who already has a some working knowledge of Mac OS X. Filled with many useful tips and hints the book contains lots of very trivial stuff that fills the majority of the pages.Maybe useful for an OS X newcomer but certainly not for an intermediate to power-user. I would recommend ""Mac OS X Hacks"" instead which has lots more to offer than this book."
5,"Excellent, useful","One more hit for the Pogue Press/O'Reilly team. This book is rich of real, useful, great hints. Just the ones about DVD snapshots, Add Ons, and some basic Unix hacks are worth the book. The truth is these are not hints that you will find elsewhere, and no useless tips made it into this volume. Worth every cent."
5,A great reference for users of any experience level.,"Mac OS X Hints is a fabulous book. Beginning, Intermediate, and even Expert users of both OS X and *nix will find this book a wonderful read.The tips are well organized, and above all very useful--this isn't unnecessary stuff. He covers tips about general appearance all the way through some neat Terminal window tricks and even gives tips for third party applications as well.Whether you're new to OS X or an old Unix geek, you'll find this book a great reference. I recommend it whole-heartedly.--Michael Greifenkamp"
3,It's OK,I think you have to press kind of hard to make it work right. It does leave red marks temporarily so you don't want to do it right before you have somewhere to go.
4,A simple tool that does teh job.,"I am not a professional, but I found this tool easy to use, my only complain is that it feels like it is not going to last very long, but after several months it is still O.K. It is not a magic tool, it will work a lot better after a long hot shower or use a facial sauna if you have one. The hot towel is not enough."
1,waste of money,"it came with instrution, but it was a total waste of time. it didn't do anything the package said it would."
1,not at all that useful,I did give a lot of pressure but still could not get the junk out! A bad buy.
1,NEVER RECEIVED....,"i ORDERED THESE TWO ITEMS AND NEVER DID RECEIVE THEM. The USPS code indicates that I did get the items, but I never did. I did get mail on the date indicated 10/23/2010, but this was not included. I am very disappointed."
3,Good help for skin care...but not a miracle worker.,"This pore extractor works well on blackheads provided they are very mature and large. I haven't found that it works very well, if at all, for white heads. For small blackheads, you'll do more damage to your skin trying to remove them than if you just left it all alone."
3,decent,"very nice quality product and it works wonders on blackheads but i found not such good results on the whiteheads. also it often had to pressured to the point of hurting to work...not sure if this is user(my) fault or product. overall, glad i went through with purchase"
1,I simply couldn't get it to work,"This tool just didn't work for me, I'm afraid. All it did was leave a red loop shape on my skin wherever I pressed it, and moving it along my skin didn't feel good, more painful than manually expressing my pores. Due to my ""If it hurts, stop doing it"" policy with my sensitive skin, I gave up after several occasions of attempting to use this tool. I wish I hadn't bought it. I've read reviews from people who have had great success with this tool, but I haven't."
4,Works Well,"When used appropriately, this little bugger does the trick every time. Certainly way better than picking or squeezing, that's for sure."
3,Good but not great!,"It is not that effective, you have to prepare your skin first! But, this is not stated on the instructions."
3,holes too large,"who has blackheads this big? rarely works for me, sometimes works on my bf's larger blackheads. the whitehead side doesnt work at all, but i wasnt buying it for that."
1,Extracts frustration instead of comedones,"This product will claim to be on the same level of the tools that dermatologists use to extract blackheads. But don't count on any instructions included to tell you how to use this little rod.I did some searching on the Internet for a clue, and all directions simply said you press the loop firmly against the blackhead to extract the comedones. Well that left a red circle on my face and made tears come out of my eyes ...but left the blackhead firmly in place.If there is a better way to use this tool I highly doubt it will produce effective results. There is simply nothing unique or different about the little metal loops than the end of your fingers. Don't waste your money on this pathetic product."
2,Hmm No really happy with it,"Very professional and robust item. But it did not work for me, it hurts the skin. I am not very familiar with such materiel so do not take my comment very seriously."
5,A great tool!,"I was hesitant to buy this at first, but I'm so glad I did. It is so easy to use and my face doesn't become irritated like it did when i used my fingers. It gets all the junk out with very little pressure most of the time. And if you have to press a little harder your face wont look busted up! This actually helps the blemish go away faster after it's been taken care of, and after I use it, it's not obvious that I just popped one."
3,Not quite.,"Not the best comedone extractor I've used. The larger end is too large for 90% of skin types. The small end works fine. I'd recommend an extractor with one end similar to the smaller end, with the other end consisting of a lancet to open pores prior to extractions. This makes for a much less painful extraction. If you don't have a lancet on your extractor, use a sterilized needle prior to extracting. You'll have a lot more success with a lot less pain. If you have small pores, I'd recommend an exteactor with a hook even smaller than the small hook on this product."
4,Suprising!,"I have been considering purchasing one of these for years, but have always been dubious about their effectiveness. I wish I had bought one years ago, when my teenagers were struggling with skin issues. This is the easiest way to clear white heads--no scarring--no long healing time--it's amazing. I always get a pimple or two when I eat chocolate (yes, I eat it anyway from time to time) and last week was no exception. I tried this tool and it was cleared away in seconds, and healed by morning. No redness, no issues.It does sting for a second, but it's over quickly and it's so worth it."
5,Bought it for my fiancee...,"I bought this for my fiancee but ended up stealing it from her... it works extremely well and is much more efficient than using your fingers. Don't get too overzealous though, or you might end up with little red rings on your face. Lol."
1,Ignorant of basic accounting.,"Here's an example: ""POSCO attributed these improvements behind its 2000 record profitability to... a decrease in the cost of goods sold due to lower depreciation expenses..."" Depreciation is never part of cost of goods sold; cost of goods sold are costs that are directly related to the goods produced, and incurred in the same period in which the goods are produced. Depreciation is related to investment in fixed assets in prior periods."
4,great product,Great product. Easy way to order and received it within a couple of days. Love Amazon. Have not had a problem with them with anything I have ordered.
5,lies women believe: and the truth that sets them free,I had the opportunity to order 7 books after I had gone to a retreat and the book was used and it really held my interest and the women that I shared the book with were very thankful.Thank you for getting the books out fast.
5,"So far, So good for Ladies Bible Class","We're using ""Lies"" in our Ladies Bible Class. Currently we are on Lesson 3 and so far, the book has been an extremely well receive page-turner. Our LBC is 30 in size and we have 1 1/2 hours together. Up through Chapter 3, attendees have been open and receptive to DeMoss' writing and have provided intense feedback. I'll post updates as we progress through the book. Our class meets once a month."
5,lies women believe:and the truth that sets them free,"we used the 25 books for our women's fellowship group! it was a wonderful, thought provoking book. we recommend this book for all females and even her other books for young ladies. many questions were answered.... well worth the great price and others plan on ordering and giving the book away as a gift!!"
2,Use Caution when reading,"I agree with a lot of the reviews here. There are things in this book that are too far over the top for me! One problem I had with the book was Nancy DeMoss' stretching the Scriptures. One I found shocking was her using Eve's attraction to the apple as a sign of food obsession! Another was watching the DVD that goes with this. Mrs. DeMoss read Gen 3:16 and either added ""You will desire control over your husband"" or her ""Bible"" says this! This is NOT the scripture! It says that you will desire your husband.....not desire to rule over him. If you are reading this book, be aware that Mrs. DeMoss misuses scripture to twist them to meet some of HER OWN thoughts and theories! I do agree with another title here that says don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. If you can get past some of her own stuff she puts in the book, there are some things to be learned."
2,Not reality...,"A friend recommended this book, and said that it would soothe my spirit and lead me to understand what God really wants for my life. The book didn't even come close-the author doesn't address the reality of women living in the 21st century. I felt as if I were in a time warp back to the 1950's where women do as they are told, and if we work outside of the home then we are inviting temptation to cheat on our husbands by exposing ourselves to male colleagues. This book denounces any type of modern women's movements that have lead to equal rights and freedom of speech. This book made me depressed after reading it-and I really thought that I know God to be a loving God and to not dislike me just because Eve made a terrible mistake. Only positive is that after reading it-I knew that my faith was based and grounded-and that the guilt, shame and degradation of women put onto us by other's negativity is just not worth buying into. Very disapointed."
1,I would give less than one star if it was an option,Some of her points are good and she can support with Bible Wisdom. Others I feel are her own opinions. I really did not like her views on childbearing. How can she make the statements she makes when she herself has never been married or bore a child. If I am not in the Will of God for practicing family planning would that not mean she is not in the Will of God for not marrying and reproduing offspring??? I feel that she is making judgements and the only person that can make judgements is God and If a women chooses not to marry and have children or she chooses to marry and have 500 kids that is her choice and we are not to judge either decision.
3,One question,"The one thing I will say (I have MANY thoughts) is this... if she believes it was wrong for women to negotiate for equal pay, does that mean that she should get less for writing this book than a man would? What would be her response to that if the publishers informed her that they were going to give her a smaller percentage of the earnings simply because she was unfortunately born with female body parts? Just curious."
4,Great Bible Study Material!,We did a Bible Study with Lies Women Believe! This book helped us see a new perspective on the Bible verses. Enjoying studying these passages with a group of women that are learning to change their way of thinking bringing God into their hearts and strengthening them.Teresa
5,MUST BUY!,"This book debunks the lies women believe every day and replaces them with strong Biblical absolute truths, which is a must-have in this world! You won't regret this purchase!"
2,Requires too much filtering,"This book was highly recommended by one of the children's pastor's at my church (a woman), so I went into reading it very excited about the study. (I have the companion study guide too.) I felt that Nancy had a lot of good points, and if you read the book with a discerning eye and heart you can get something good from it... but I found that she didn't offer more than a few verses (sometimes only 1!) to back up her claims, and she was also very opinionated about a few topics that I don't think are so clear in Scripture.She also gives a lot of ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" which sometimes can be discouraging rather than encouraging. Overall, I did learn from her, but I felt it required too much filtering on my part. Some of the things she says come across pretty offensively if you do not give her the benefit of the doubt.Bottom Line: There are better, more encouraging books for Christian women out there!!!"
4,perfect for a small group study!,"This book is an incredible conversation starter for a small group. While my group did not necessarily agree with everything Ms. DeMoss wrote, we did have great discussions following each chapter. Many of us had never thought about the issues she brought up. And even though several chapters deal with marriage and child-rearing, it is appropriate for single women as well. If this thought-provoking, Scripture-based book doesn't get you talking, I don't know what will!"
5,Very convicting,"This is one of the best books that I have read regarding women in the church. DeMoss makes no apologies for telling it like it is, and she doesn't shy away from difficult topics. Some of the issues she addresses have been accepted practice within many churches, and though some may have a problem with what she says, she is right- on. I recommend this book to my Christian women friends often."
5,Don't throw out the baby with the bath water,"I do not agree with Nancy Leigh DeMoss on her views of birth control; however, I believe her wisdom and Biblical insight throughout the book have opened my eyes! God has blessed her with a wonderful ability to bring the scriptures to life in terms of practical application. I would highly recommend this book if you want to take an honest and open look at your walk with God!"
3,"No Great Revelations, but a Decent Read","Didn't find too many ""AHA"" moments in this book; mostly just concepts/ideas we've heard before, but perhaps phrased a little differently. I wasn't offended (as some reviewers indicated they were), but I felt that many of her ""lies"" were really contrived...I mean, how many of us REALLY believe that ""I can sin and get away with it"" or ""God doesn't love me""? Maybe my friends and I (we used this book for a study group) are in a different place than the readers Ms DeMoss is targeting, but we felt many of the ""lies"" the author claims to be prevalent beliefs of most women, were somewhat ridiculous. Once we got past the defined ""lies"", however, the ""truths"" Ms De Moss offered were valid Christian principles...just nothing we hadn't heard before."
5,DEFINATELY MUST READ...LIFE CHANGING!!,I was amazed to see that there were negative reviews on this book. Like another review said...I can't imagine reading this book and not have it change your life! I have never wanted to finish a book so quickly...I was so eager to continue reading from the very begining. This was so freeing for me to recognize that so many of my negative thoughts are from the enemy. The enemy doesn't want us to know the truth...and will do anything in his power to succeed...he feeds on our insecurities and makes us think we are the way we are and that's that. This book is eye opening to Gods word...His Truth...and the reality of the enemy. I believe if anyone has a problem with this book...it's because they have unresolved issues that they are holding on to and haven't given those issues over to God yet. Pray before you read it that you will have an open heart and mind to learn what God wants you to. I told all of my friends about this book and I hope it continues down the line.
4,"No hassel, nice packaging","The product was packaged and shipped in a very good condition, but little slow on shipping. Overall good!"
4,miserable,"There is a saying that goes, ""The truth will set you free, but first it may make you miserable."" That certainly applied to a lot of people Jesus preached to. They did not want their way of life disturbed. The church today has gotten soft, teaching us to ""feel comfortable"" as Christians and it is dying for want of the hard Truth. Jesus was tested, had trials and suffered. Should I expect less than my Lord? I may not like everything Nancy says, even question her authority on some things, but it causes me to search for the Truth myself instead of taking the word of someone else. I especially like the chapter on lies we believe about sin. If we confess and repent, we are freed. Otherwise we stay captive to ungodly living. Lies Women Believe has challenged me to a deeper walk with God. Thank you, Nancy."
3,Some really good insights but a few things off,"I really appreciate a lot of Nancy's insights and have definitely learned and grown from reading this book. However, I do not appreciate the ""diary"" entries--it's like adding to the Bible, which is forbidden. Instead, Nancy could have just written in prose her speculations about what problems Eve may have encountered in her life. I think that would have been just as effective. I also think Nancy was a little biased in some of her ideas, considering the fact that she is not married and has no children."
2,Lies Women Believe,"This book had a lot of extreme views. Demoss generalizes constantly. I felt she twisted scripture to explain her point of view. I did gleam some good out of the book. I am a fairly new Christian and I felt it was more harmful then good. I felt it could give a Christain women a feeling there are only absolutes to God's way, that we are not individuals. I felt it weighed me down more than lifted me up. I had to go back to God's word and study because at times I felt the study was toxic. I think Demoss is very biased and narrow minded. I would especially not recommend it if you are a new Christian. I also about group study I would only recommend it if you are with seasoned Christians who are willing to be objective about this book."
1,Don't waste your money.,"We studied this book in our women's Bible study group...only for as long as we could stand it. The author has some interesting points, but her judgmental attitude was quite intolerable. She questioned the salvation of anyone who disagrees with her - that is utterly disgusting. It may bring up points of conversation, but it is not worth your time or money. My book ended up in the trash."
5,Lies Women Believe,"This book is highly recommended for all women of any age to build their foundation.I Love this study. I'm leading a group of 10 women of whom are over 40 years old and we are now learning some of the basic truths that are setting us free. These are actual lies that we've believed.I like how the chapters are laid out with the ""Nutshell"" in the beginning & the lies and truths at the end along with a prayer.This layout of the study has truly made my job easy as this flows so well."
1,DeMoss is Deceitful,"Don't fall for DeMoss's disingenousness. She claims she does not want women to be deceived, but interprets scripture to fit her own agenda. She imports her own biases into scripture and pulls out interpretations that are not supported by the text at all. For a much more accurate view of the subject matter, I recommend J. Lee Grady's ""Ten Lies the Church Tells Women: How the Bible Has Been Used to Keep Women in Spiritual Bondage."""
3,Carefree,"Neither fish nor fowl: Fred & Ginger's stab at screwball comedy isn't consistently funny enough, and the hee-larious hijinx cut too much into the dancing time. 3 or 4 numbers is *not* enough. Ralph Bellamy wears too much make-up. But the slo-mo ""Color Blind"" dance is trippy and sensuous, and we get to see F&G actually kiss! Too bad the number isn't in color as originally planned. 6/10"
2,"not enough dancing, not enough singing, too much pseudo psychiatry","I am not sure what others see in this movie. I was unimpressed. The singing and dancing were on the sparse side. The ""psychiatry"" thing, freudian allusions, conscious and unconscious mind might have been cutting edge in 1938 but fall flat now. My wife and I got through this movie, but it is not one we would watch again. The DVD was a reasonable quality, the sound was adequate, the image ok."
4,one of the best,"*Carefree* is one of my favorite of the Astaire/Rogers series. I like this one because Ginger is not her usual skeptical self about poor Fred, who's usually trying to woo her. She falls in love instantly, and it's convincing. After that, he can't really help himself. This film has some pretty good dance sequences and some great comedy."
1,"This DVD is a ""homebrew"" pirated copy",Don't waste your money. With the full OFFICIAL collection coming out within only a few months (and the Secret of the Sword + 5 best eps of She-Ra available NOW) why spend money on bootlegs?I'm surprised this is even still listed on Amazon.
5,She- Ra : The wrath of Hordak,She-Ra comes to life again for a new generation of fans as well as the previous ones on this DVD collection!
5,Grandson Loves It!,This is another book we gave our bug loving grandson for his birthday. He loves it!
5,Does the job,"I use this binder for my 8x5 index cards which list bus routes and timetables for them. This is an easy and effective way of keeping track of them rather than having to check google maps for transit information constantly. If I tried to keep the index cards in a stack with a rubberband it wouldn't work as well, because with the binder I can just flip through it as needed. Highly recommend this item."
5,Standard binder,Nice size for small recipe book that I'm putting together. Fits standard small refill pages. Doesn't feel cheap. Good price. Shipped quickly. No complaints.
5,Great binder!,"I ordered two of these for my sisters. First of all, this binder did not arrive in the color it appears on the picture. It looks like a dark green in the picture but the binders were black. It does say in the description that it is black though, I just want to make sure the picture is not misleading.However, these binders are great! I wanted some half binders and I could not find them anywhere. These seemed the cheapest on Amazon, yet the quality is very nice. These are convenient for small purses and small bags that you take to school. My sisters love them and I would recommend these binders to anyone."
1,Server only,"This item is for serving only, it will not keep the liquid hot or cold more than 30 mins."
4,music stand,I bought this for my son as his first music stand. I didn't want to spend a lot of money since I wasn't sure how long the guitar lessons would last. So far it has worked well. It was the best price that I found.
3,Good but not great music stand,This music stand will hold about three music books. More books will cause it to bend backwards. It does fold up small for storage. Overall is was worth the price for this item. We would purchase it again; but wish it was a it sturdier.
1,Why do people think this guy can sing??,"Sorry, I think this guy is one of the most overrated singers out there today. He always sounds like he is singing holding his nose shut. VERY nasal sounding.If you want to listen to an incredibly beautiful voice, buy one of Josh Groban's CD's--you won't regret it! He has the voice of the century!"
5,"Review for ""Promise Highway"" by Mark Cook",I love this CD and would definitely recommend it to anyone out there who is a blues fan to give it a listen - I purchased my copy from www.CDBaby.com for $15 and it was worth every penny (not sure why it's so expensive on Amazon?). I have a wide collection of blues CDs and never get tired of listening to this particular CD. Love the guitar and song arrangments. Randy (BLUES FAN)
4,Entertaining and educational,"This entertaining, amusing and sometimes hackles-raising book exposes the sneaky tricks of the advertising industry in trying to separate you from your money. It features examples from the ""Selling It"" column of Consumer Reports magazine in the USA.You'll see examples of ""free"" offers that cost a lot, ""all new"" products without anything new (except perhaps less value for money), deceptive packaging, sneaky tricks from car dealers, and more.At the least, you'll be entertained. And if it makes you look more carefully at the advertising and marketing that bombards you in everyday life, that's a bonus."
2,"SORRY, BUT IT PLAYS TERRIBLE 4.75 OUT OF 10","I tried to like this game, I really did, but the controls are horrible and some of the worst I've experienced when trying to shoot something. When playing I also wondered why it took developers so long to utilize the second analog stick and why it took so long for them to learn how to develop for the Playstation platform. While the story is well-done, it was hard to appreciate under the terrible gameplay. So I'll understand if Syphon Filter fans hate me because of this review, but seriously the gameplay is terrible."
3,Jarrid's Syphon Filter Review,"The Game is allright, i just wish it were a wi bit 'arder.it is all about stealth action, a bloody gun game and thats allgabe is your charicture, you go through the same stuff in any other game... you got to save the world. or at least try.there is a virus called The Syphon Filter virus that is genetticale engineered with the capibilitys of targeting spicific personel.basic game nothin real special."
4,Metal Gear Solid Lite,"And I really don't mean that as a bad thing at all. This game captures much of the feel of Metal Gear Solid without some of the complexity of the plot, and yes, some of the neat gameplay features.Overall, this game gives more of a shoot-to-kill impression. Take your pistol, go for the head shots, then grab up those automatic HKs that the gaurds drop. In each levels the enemies get progressively harder (from impossibly bad shots in the first level, to flak-vest clad automatic-weapon toting trios in the later levels), making that head shot all the more important as time goes on.The gameplay is great and the levels impressive. My personal favorite is one where two different forces are caught up in a small scale war, and you need to dodge the gunfire to accomplish your mission. It's fun to get caught up in the mass melee, if a bit unproductive.All in all, this is a great game for the Playstation console."
5,Great combination of Action and Strategy!,"Great, great game! You need to master moves, learn to snipe, and really think in this game. Not many out there like these! If you liked Goldeneye, you will love this one!"
5,amazing,this game is amazing!gameplay 9 out of 10 its great realistic and a m79 rocket launcher 2 rifles lots of gunssound 7 out of 10 great Logans voice is lame thographics 10 out of 10 great! gun fire looks nice explosins are awesome!!!! amazing graphics are great peoples face look odd but that dos not effect gameplayplot is nice game is great get this game!
5,What started it all...,"This game is indeed what started it all. The graphics were great, considering its an early PSOne release. The storyline is a bit farfetched and predictable, but likeable (and face it, you've seen worse). The controls are extremely easy to work with, the missions are satisfactory, and you get to shoot ppl. What more do you want?"
4,Syphon Filter,"Ah, the PS1 era, where we didn't notice the crpaulent 3D graphics and actually thought that they looked... good. Well, the game has aged poorly from a graphical standpoint, but as a game, still as fun as it was the first time around. Although i fist passed it off as a poor man's Metal Gear, the game is actually quite different, interplaying both stealth and gunplay quite well. I reccomend very much."
4,"Good game, but it needs a make over.","The game is excellent. The plot is good. I mean, what can be better than a deadly poison killing people? But the graphics could have been infinitly better. The faces are flat, and have hardly any detail, and that is in the movie scenes! The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay. The guns, well let me just say it leaves more to be desired. Blood is extremly fake looking, but there is tons of it! But the actual play itself is very fun.Now for the sound. Music is okay. Gun fire sounds are awesome. But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs. As soon as one is finished speaking, the other one cuts in right away. Not a very big deal, but it wears on after awhile.Graphics 3/10Sound 7/10Gameplay 10/10Blood Content 9/10Overall 7/10"
5,The perfect first person shooter!,"Syphon Filter is a difficult FPS that combines stealth and head on combat. The levels are very well thought out and require some patience and clear thinking ability. I nominate this as the best FPS to grace the PS1. The series gets progressively weaker, although SF2 is nearly on par with the first version."
4,Perhaps the next big thing since Metal Gear Solid,"Great game, affects, and story line. The only gripe I have is that some scenes are really difficult. Otherwise well worth the investment"
3,"Okay ,but Boring","This game was fun the first few times I played it. After a while it started to get boring. It's just the SAME thing every level. Shoot the bad guys until you get to the end.You might disagree the first few times you play it, but believe me it will get boring after a while"
2,"Ok the first few times, then it just gets boring.","When I first bought this game last january, I played it a few times and found the controls to be tricky. The graphics arent worth psx, and it is pretty boring. There is almost no sound..."
4,"great graphics, cool story line and good game play","This game reminds me of the James Bond movies, you are a special agent try desperatly to stop a virus sweeping the nation, not sure of the source, but presumed to be terrorists using it to get what they want. You have a comlink that your partner uses often to tell you where to go and what to do next, not really a hard game, just takes some time to go through, well worth the money spent if you're into this type of fast paced action. Personally I like the sniper rifle."
5,The best,"Syphon Filter is the best playstation game ever made. It's intense fast paced and has something for almost everyone. I would say it's even better then the second game, I play some levels over and over. If you like shoot'em ups and can stand a little blood this is a must. I rented this game and after returning it, I went back to Tomorrow Never Dies. It was like going back to a Neon after driving a Porch."
5,The best.,"This is the game of all games. For anybody who likes a GOOD challenge like I do, you should invest in this. It took me about 20 hours of saved progress but it was worth every minute. This falls into the category of very good. I loved the missions, and the weapons, but the best for me is figuring out the puzzels (levels) them selves. The game is kind of like all Army men games, or Tomb Raider, Spec Ops, and so on. This is not for the young mind that does not like to think, but for the young adult to adult that likes a good puzzel. Buy it, rent it, borrow it from a friend. You will not regret it."
4,Suites my purpose just fine,I have over ten of the folders and they really work well. I make picture collage diaries and put two years per note book. They are easily storied.
4,Excellent way to carry your games around!,Very compact and an easy way to keep your games organized and safe. Perfect to have several games to choose from.
4,Good cases,There's not a lot to say - these cases are decent quality and fit much better in my pockets than 10 or 12 DS game cases.
3,they do the job,"these are ok, a pacakge of four and two wont stay closed. I suppose for how cheap they are I cant complain..."
3,darth vader the figure does not look right.,I GOT THIS STAR WARS FIGURE IN SEPTEMBER.WHEN I OPEN IT IT GOT NOTTING BUT A SAME LOOK AS THE OLD ACTION FIGURE. PS IF YOU ARE A STAR WARS FAN YOU GOT TO GET DARTH VADER AS A ACTION FIGURE.
2,You get what you pay for,The ink seemed to print light. It was not as good as the new cartridges purchased from a regular office supply store.
4,Works Well. Reasonably priced.,"They work fine however, you don't get the number of pages it says you will. Great for inexpensive ink. Also works for just printing quick copies for work."
3,26 lexmark replacement,"good cartridge but can dry out nozzles and have to soak for a while until ink loosens up in nozzles, But this happens with new cartridges as well, not just replacement ones"
3,Good Price,"My children write alot of stuff for high school so finding inexspensive replacement ink for their printer was important. As teachers don't like having to print it from email. So far no issues with color ink 26 I purchased. Have to wait and see what total page yield will be,but seems to be working ok for them."
2,Compatible Lexmark 26 inkjet printer cartridge,I order 5 ink cartridgesI thought this was excellent since the first one I used was good. Then I used 2 more and only had two ink colors and was very disappointed. The 3rd one was half full. Out of 5 only only 2 were good. Im sending the 3 back.
4,For those who miss the mighty Kyuss!,"Heres, Wrench for all of us, ""Oscillator Blues"" offers the same stoner, desert, sludge,cosmic vibe that Kyuss used to perform , dont expect here anything new or any innovation, Wrench are not reinventing the wheel , however this effort from the aussies its like the path that Homme and co. should have taken after ...And the circus, and I gotta tell you, Wrench is almost as ejoyable as the Palm Springs legends.HM"
4,"Misleading title, but great case for DS *games*!","Don't be misled by the title, this is for holding DS GAMES, not the system itself (just look at the picture). It officially holds 12 DS games and three GBA games, but mine came with two sleeves for GBA games (which wouldn't fit if you tried to fit them all because it would be too thick). However, you can jam two DS games in each of the GBA holders (side-by-side) -- which means I have a total of *24* DS games in this case!As others have mentioned, it's a very tight fit, at least initially. I'm sure the compartments will stretch out a bit later. For right now I have to push up from the bottom to get each game out, but that's okay for me. I know they won't fall out on their own, and that's important. The case is very strong, and looks nice. Perfect for what I was looking for. If you want a case to hold games, it's great -- ignore the bad reviews from people hoping to hold the system."
2,TOO SMALL,"Although this case says it holds DS and regular Game Boy games, it's too thin to put in anything but DS games."
2,"Sweeping, if often flawed, diplomatic work.","Gardner has produced a work which must be addressed, though it is plagued by flawed conclusions and choppy writing. Gardner focuses almost entirely on the foreign influences on Wilson during World War I and neglects the major domestic problems that were pulling at the president. This could be forgiven if not for the dry and lifeless manner in which Gardner lays out the diplomatic machinations of the world powers during the period. Be prepared to re-read several passages....and re-read several passages....and re-read several passages. For a better read on diplomacy during WWI, check out Thomas Knock's ""To End All Wars"""
5,Love It!,I use this daily and I love it! It is great quality and the flipper is big enough to easily turn pancakes and omelets. Definitely a kitchen staple.
4,Works well,"I bought this for my daughter, as a gift she had it on her wish list. She had one already and liked it so much she wanted another one. She was happy to have a second one."
4,sturdy turner with clean lines,Was looking to replace my 60 yr old family turner. It was super thin but alas it finally broke. Would have given this turner 5 stars if it were abit thinner and more flexible. Mostly want a thin turner to make eggs over easy. However this works OK for eggs but great on everything else. Love the clean lines and high temp silicon handle. This one should last more than 60 years since there is no rivets!
4,Heavy duty spatula,"I am going to leave a review so people would know what to expect. This is a giant, heavy duty turner. This is the biggest spatula I have ever seen in my life, it looked like it's designed to flip burgers or steak at a barbecue sitting.I was looking for a household use spatula, meaning the ones I would use to flip eggs every morning. Totally not what I am looking for. Though I returned the item and didn't get to use it, I am going to giving it 4 stars just because I am nice enough to not hurt the reputation of a product I have never used before."
5,Perfect for someone who just got their Rebel XT,"This dvd is perfect for someone who just got the Rebel XT. they just don't tell you about the features on the camera, they show you how to use them. They show you everything with pictures. If would have known about this video when I first got my rebel xt. I would have known the answers to questions I use to ask people. I would tell anybody, but this dvd, it really helps with everything you need to know on your camera."
5,Great drama.,I really like these radio dramas. They are well done and easy to listen to. The cast is awesome. You really feel like you are with the characters.
4,Dramtic audio is a plus,Not the best in the series but still terrific! Looking at the other reviews I will leave the politics of religion out of this even though it is about religion. The characters are wonderful and even the ones I hate I love how they fill their parts. Dramatic audio on CD is really a terrific thing and I will look for more made like this. If you have not listened to the first audio books in this series you really should start at the beginning. Remember to get only the Dramatic audio versions!
2,Vinyl cover splits,The vinyl cover was split when it arrived new and the replacement binder soon split as well. Functional as long one accepts a torn cover.
3,Address Book,"Quality is a little cheap, but it is hard to find a three ring address book. Being able to add and remove pages is a must have."
1,address book,"I love the book itself big letters plenty of room to writebut want anything but black or brown, a solid color or a print would be nice"
2,Unsuitable for my needs,"The address book did not suit my needs. The spaces were too small for all the information to be entered, and there were too many sections per page. I returned the product and received a refund for the product, but shipping charges for receiving and returning the product cost more than the phone book. The next time I need a phone book, I will go to the store to purchase."
1,NOT HAPPY ... NO AREA FOR EMAIL ADDRESSES AND DID NOT SHOW WHAT PAGES CONTAIN,"NOT HAPPY WITH THE PAGES. THEY ONLY HAVE AREA FOR ADDRESS, PHONE # AND FAX BUT NOT FOR EMAIL ADDRESSES... OLD STYLE...NOT GREAT"
1,Loud and Defective,Sorry but this one sounds like a small prop engine plane taking off when you're sitting next to the computer--that's set on high--the ONLY setting that would work and it STILL wasn't up to the correct speed. This oen's going back.
2,Not a DBB fan,"This product is being falsely labeled as the TriCool double ball bearing model. It is not the DBB (UPC 0761345-75121-6), but actually the regular model (0761345-75120-9) which means lower durability. Buyer Beware."
4,Antec TriCool 120mm fan...does what it says it does,"Works fine, 3-speed control to set as u wish. It's not a PWM fan so don't expect to use it with PWM 4-pin headers, but it works a treat otherwise with 3-pin headers (set to highest speed setting first if you're using onboard speed management via bios.)"
4,It is what it says it is.,I've had it in for a couple of weeks and its quiet and keeps my hard drives cool. Can't really complain at this point. I hope the bearings (if it has them? no clue) don't get noisy or give out or whatever but that typically takes years or abuse for it to happen anyways.
5,Antec TriCool 92mm DBB Case Fan,"Bought 3 of these fans.Set all 3 fans speed at LOW, very quiet and air flow is good.Great deal and shipping from Amazon.comIf you want to avoid recent sales taxes that being charged by Amazon.com,go with other internet site."
1,Not happy with this product,"I ordered two of these to replace the originals in my P182 that died after a year and a half. I thought they'd be a step up since they were ball bearing, but on low speed they have a high pitched whine that the originals didn't have. I'm going to have to replace them."
2,"Does the job, no bells or whistles though","Nice fan but i was expecting better but for the price it,s ok"
3,"Good product, so-so vendor","I have one of these fans already in my computer, but decided to get another to help cool the system off more. And they are pretty quiet. Recommend the fan, but not so sure of the vendor (PC Universe). I was disappointed in how I received this product. The fan appears to be working just fine, but the packaging had been opened and resealed (hence the 3 stars). Not sure if I've gotten a refurbished model or not, but it looked new. As always, however, Amazon was great."
3,Good but loud,"The quality of this fan is good and it pushes plenty of air and is effective, but it is REALLY loud and that is why it is only 3 stars."
5,Works like it should,"So what I ordered was the basic 3-speed fan with no lights on it. I'm soon to be doing a bit of gaming and figured I'd get another fan, so I ordered this.It's great, I tested it out by hosting a MC server and played on it with a couple friends. My computer usually tops out at about 117F when I do this. This fan on high, dropped it to 105F.Sadly, this fan was the wrong size... so it's hanging from my PCI slots with twist-ties. I'll soon be moving it to the front of my computer, to bring air in while the factory issued fan plus another PCI slot fan pulls the air out.Other than being the wrong size(my own fault), it works amazing."
3,PC case fan replacement,Pretty quiet and works great.Only problem I had was that the pc still doesn't recognise it and have to hit F2 before it will boot. but I do like the quiet.
4,Great fan. Not to loud.,"Due to it's size, I was worried it was going to be louder than my previous fans. This was definately not the case. After purchasing 3 fans I am finally satisfied with this..."
2,"Quiet, low air flow, even on high.","Claiming that this fan's ""3-speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling"", is very misleading. On low, the fan barely moves any air. On high, it still doesn't move much air, and is incredibly quiet, nearing silent in my opinion. If you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads, this is NOT the fan for you. The 3-speed switch is useless, as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high."
4,"Quiet, long power cord.","As previous reviewer stated, this fan is NOT double ball bearing which Antec give the code TriCool 92mm DBB.The air flow is modest even at high speed.That's how you get the silent cooling.It works just like advertised.I want to add one more point is that it comes with a fair long power cord.This makes it perfect for using as the front fan."
4,Good fan.,"My original case fan was incredibly loud. It doesn't pay to go too cheap on the case fans. I'm not a 'modder' and don't spend time making the computer case look pretty, but I wanted a fan that would run quiet and help contribute to the overall process of keeping the case cool. This fan seems to do both just fine for my needs. The blue light it emits is a nice gimmick too. The fan shipped to me quickly and without any troubles. I would recommend this fan."
3,Irritatingly noisy for the cost and air flow,"I bought this fan to place in the side panel of a computer. I wasn't sure what speed I wanted and I liked the idea of having a switch to select lo/med/high. Now that I've gotten it I wish I'd selected something else. It looks like a quality fan, is priced like a quality fan, but is irritatingly noisy. I don't know that it's especially loud, but it's got a whine that would prevent me from using it on high.It may last forever, but I won't buy another one."
5,Great 3 Speed Fan - Poor packing,"Fan's low speed setting is just the ticket for cooling hard drives. Ordered two fans, one arrived open and most likely in used condition. No packing material except for one small bubble pack, but these fans are sealed in a well designed plastic container so lack of packing was not the cause of the open container. Retuned and received a replacement without any problems."
5,It does what its supposed to,"Quiet, cheap, good airflow. No complaints, ordered 2 more to replace some louder fans in my machine. Cant go wrong"
4,Good fan,It was just what I was expecting. Gets the job done and keeps my video card cool. Nothing really more to say on the matter.
1,High pitched electrical buzzing,"I was attracted to this fans variable speed and emphasis on quiet operation. After installation I began hearing an intermittent electrical buzzing noise. I confirmed that the fan blades were clear and not being clipped. I then confirmed that it wasn't due to the installation (case vibration, etc.) by detaching it from case and running the fan sitting on my desk by itself. When it continued to make the noise I sent it back for a replacement. I had the same problem with the replacement and returned it for a refund. Instead, I'm now using theCooler Master BladeMaster 92mm PWM High Air Flow Silent Case Fan R4-BM9S-28PK-R0and it works great."
4,4 Stars,"These fans are beautiful and quiet. I bought 4 of them at one time. I used two as case fans in an antec 900-2 case, and planned to swap two Noctua fans for these on a Noctua NH-U12P SE1366. Noctua makes some very ugly fans btw... Well Sad to say the plan did not work. These fans fit perfectly, quiet as you can expect. Unfortunately the airflow was just not nearly as powerful as Noctua's fans. If you don't overclock... it would work I'm certain. But I OC'd my i7-930 to 4GHz and it was overheating after an hour or so. Replaced the Noctua fans and no problems since. So My advice, as case fans these are great. Don't sub them out on coolers"
3,OK Fan...didn't last as long as I hoped,"I have had this fan for 2.5 years...currently shopping to replace it :-(I am using it for secondary cooling in an always-on, non-gaming, Dual Core system running dual monitors and 3 hard drives.I like the three-speed switch...however, my cooling needs required that I leave it on the highest speed most of the spring and summer- which was a bit loud for my tastes, but tolerable.That is, it was tolerable until now...it has been crazy-loud (and getting louder) the last few days. I'm guessing it threw a bearing as a good bang (or three)to the the perforated case plate in front of it will cause the noise to decrease for short periods.Oh well...I guess over 2 years is a good run for anything this inexpensive."
3,I need more speed,"I would prefer more speed. For normal operation, it's ok. For hard work, it's weak."
5,"Great Fan, Cool Blue LED","I bought 4 of these fans for my Antec Case. They are very quiet; they provide excellent ventilation, and last but not least, they are super cool looking with their blue LED lights.You know right away these fans are working because they light up like a Christmas tree. :)Highly recommended."
4,Cheap and quiet. Not powerful,"This came at a too good to be true price, (less than $4) and delivered better than expected. It's small, light weight, the speed adjuster works fine, the adapters and screws are just enough to get the job done.This fan is almost silent. Like sub-20 db. At the highest setting you can hear a faint buzz but at mid and low it's like it's not even on.That being said, I had to give this a 4 star review because with that fan silence comes a price. Low air flow. This is not the fan you want to choose for a CPU cooler, this is better suited for an extra case fan mount that isn't doing anything.Quiet, weak, cheap. Hey 2/3 ain't bad."
5,Works like it's supposed to,"This is the first comp fan I have purchased. The fan on my hp went out. I didn't have any problems. It was easy to hook up, and the multi-speed is good (I guess. I just have it on the lowest speed for now). Not much else to say."
4,Does its job,"I bought two of these for my current Coolermaster case. I installed one on the top to use as an exhaust fan. If attached correctly, it is rather quiet. The screws are difficult to sit correctly and can make a noise when accidentally shifted. I ended up just screwing in two on opposite sides. You have the option of attaching it to either the power supply or motherboard. It was easier for me to attach it to the PSU, so I just ended up doing that. Even on high speed (you have the choice between low, medium, and high) I barely notice a noise difference. The LED lights are bright enough and provide some extra light when gaming in the dark."
4,Very good fans,"I purchased two of these fans for a small form factor computer. My computer's original PWM fans are loud and do not provide good airflow. When set to the slowest speed setting (factory default), these non-PWM Antec fans provide much better airflow. I can still hear them whooshing in the background, but they are much quieter and lack the mechanical buzzy noise of my original PWM fans. I rate these Antec fans as four stars simply because they are somewhat audible from four to six feet away at the slowest setting. Otherwise, I think these Antec fans are well worth the money, provide a lot of airflow even at the slowest setting, and offer a big improvement over most stock fans (PWM or not). I would purchase them again."
4,antec cooling fan,Antec Tricool 80mm fan is all good. Shows of pretty with the blue led's in my mid tower. Works very good.
3,It works.,"It's a case fan.It gives you 3 speed options.On low it's very quiet.On the highest setting you hear a faint humming noise. Not unpleasant.I don't know how much cooling it does or doesn't do, no baseline to compare to.The ability to change the fan speed is a good feature to have"
5,Antec TriCool 80mm BLUE LED Fan,"The fan shipped quick and it has been working wonders in my computer so far. Light output is a nice, deep blue. Speed settings is a plus when it comes to power absorption and air circulation. Highly recommended product."
2,Got loud after a year,"Was great for about a year, then started sounding like a disk drive starting up...permanently. Going to replace it, but not with this brand."
2,good looking fan -Update-,It`s a bit noisy when choosing high but that`s what fans supposed to be at high speed which means they are doing their jobs of cooling.Update:A lot less than a year of using it started being so noisy even at low speed. getting new fans.
2,A hollow echo of past greatness,"This isn't a bad song. I think it's kind of decent. But when placed next to U2's ""One"", ""With Or Without You"" or ""Stay"", it folds like a cheap patio chair. Essentially, U2 have switched to auto-pilot for the past 2 albums. ""Sometimes"" is a song they could have written in their sleep.I'm the biggest U2 fan in the universe. But I also know when a band has passed their prime. U2 is no longer the band that creates new sounds. They are quite content to recycle a ""Joshua Tree"" riff or an ""Achtung Baby"" sample in the guise of a ""new"" song.Overall, it's a decent track. But U2 are victims of their own great past. Thus, we want more becuase we know they used to be capable of it."
3,The most depressing book I have ever read,"Dear Potential Reader! BEWARE! This book can really get you down. Personally, I consider this one as the most depressing book I have ever read. I am a mother and to me the number of forsaken children, not to mention the dead ones, present on first 50 pages of this book turned out to be too much. My adventure with ""Angels Crest"" finished with big histerical tears in the middle of the book and afterwards I just couldn't make myself read a word more. Moreover, the plot seems to be ""too dense"" - too many persons, too many tragedies, too little place for the writer to explore it all.So if you have small children of your own and want to keep your smiling mood for the weekend - DO NOT READ THIS ONE."
5,great hair rock band,"This is a another creat cd from this band it rocks from the first song to the last .It sonds like ratt meets cinderella its that goos .The standouts are billie, lifes been good ,so long ,and now .The cd is well written and played just another great cd from miss crazy, who the the lead singer is allso in freakshow another great band .If you like hair metal try this band iam sure it wont let you down.I hope this review was helpfull to you"
5,Awesome rock n roll!,"This totally kicks a55, in the true spirit of rock n roll. From the first song to the last, this cd is a must have if you're a rocker."
2,Not exactly what I thought it was,This was my first experience with an mp3 player. The lights and rims are great. The sound is just okay. Comes with four batteries installed but takes six batteries. My son liked this item and happy to get it for the holidays.
2,"Interesting, but dead wrong","The ""Dunning School,"" centered at a Columbia University where Dunning taught, provided the academic underpinnings for rationalizing the horrors of reconstruction and later of Jim Crow segregation. Dunning made ""Birth of a Nation"" possible.Some of the material is useful for professional historians or students who are aware of the context. Much of the data is relevant.But nearly 80 years after his death, Dunning continues to exert a malevolent influence on Americans who seek to justify their racist views. A tragedy, because Dunning himself would likely have acknowledged that he was wrong.As it is, the ""Dunning School"" is totally discredited."
1,-_-,this item looks like the JDM lights but it better having the true jdm because it should have two holes to screw in to the headlights
5,A Totally Delicious Read,"This book is: well-written, well-plotted and well-paced, with realistic characters.Its seldom one gets a treat like ""And Love Came Calling"" a lesbian western, which is also a love story.The story revolves around two central female characters: Sophie McLaren, a recent widow who now has been forced since the death of her husband, to accept the begrudging charity of her domineering and dangerous brother-in-law, and Kendra ""Kenny"" Smith, a butch woman who has found it necessary to disguise herself as a man.The story involves: a stagecoach hold-up, saloon girls with the proverbial hearts of gold, a fair & determined sheriff, outlaws, and a whole lot more.This excellent novel has found a permanent home on my bookshelf, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys strong female characters and a historical setting like the old west--you won't be disappointed, that's for sure."
1,Good read for ostriches,"If you want to believe that there are no serious environmental problems on this planet, this book is for you."
3,Good quality but....,"I own this good quality leather case and I really like it. It has a very useful clip that can be clipped in your belt, pant or wherever you want.However, if you want to put your tungsten T3 into the craddle you have to remove the case. The real problem is that the sliding part of the T3 tends to become loose since you have to pull it everytime you remove the case."
3,somebody goofed,"This is not one of Bert Jansch's better albums overall, and is certainly inferior to anything else he produced, as a solo act or with Pentangle, over the first ten years of his recording career. Somebody had the bright idea of trying to turn the gravel-voiced Jansch into a pop star, so took a set of his love songs and enveloped them with the sappy-strings-&-such arrangements of the period. I think somebody goofed. Although the set does contain some very good material ('Nicola', 'Weeping Willow Blues', 'Love is Pleasing', and 'Come Back Baby'), most of it just doesn't make it. Only for the more tolerant of Jansch fans, though the bonus cuts 'In This Game' and 'Dissatisfied Blues' improve the package, and some may be interested in hearing Jansch play twelve-string and electric guitars on a couple of tracks. Give this one a '3.49' rating..."
1,Standing in the Need of a Blessing,"This DVD does not show James Cleveland. He is not on it. So why is he on the cover? The cover is MISLEADING. Why pay for a DVD with people you do not know? If you want to see James Cleveland, I would recommend the Gospel Gospel (2002)Starring: James Cleveland, Walter Hawkins Director: David Leivick, Frederick A. Ritzenberg."
5,The Hopeful Heart,"John had a unique manner of using the language. In reading this book, as in all of his others, I found myself getting lost in the text, and imagining that I was sitting in a pew listening to him preach."
5,The Hopeful Heart,"Anyone who knew John Claypool, or has read any of his works will find this another inspiring gem. This is a message of hope - what it is and what it is not. This book will not disappoint."
1,Battery Problems,"Great concept and with a little practice this device does delever usable duplicates (Equivilent to a fax). The software that comes with this pen is great.Enough of the good.The battery life in this pen is terible. I had to replace the original batteries within a week. I haven't had the heart to replace the second set yet, and haven't used my pen since I bought it."
1,A disappointment,"This device holds great promise, but doesn't deliver consistently. I'm a history grad student wishing to defeat the high cost and tedium of photocopying documents in the archives. The DocuPen was difficult to set up, the USB cable never worked (the conventional cable did), and the clarity of the scanned images was uneven. The biggest problem: it took repeated efforts to obtain usable images. Thus, before I could finish my work, I had to connect the portable scanner to my laptop to verify that I had captured what I came to the archive for. Often the scanner would stop reading the document before I had scanned it completely. Thus I had to scan the same item multiple times. The manual warns that may take ""a bit of practice"" to get the speed and steadiness of your scan-passes correct. But after four tedious hours of climbing the learning curve, I boxed it up for return, and went back to the photocopier. Next trip, I'll go back to dragging a flatbed scanner into the archive."
4,Another Worthy Re-Release,"This is third re-release of Victor Feldman's material from the defunct British Tempo label. There's some good material here, most notably the superb 'Blues in Two Moods', a stunning big-band piece that vividly brings to mind the gloomy London of the mid-1950s, and Jimmy Deuchar's excellent moody trumpet on the equally atmospheric 'It Ain't Necessarily So'. There are some rough bits, such as when drummer Tony Crombie takes over the piano on one track, but this is mostly a worthwhile album, and it's good to see this material available again."
5,Excellent for novices on Mac world,The author explains himself clearly and cleverly. Easy to follow when instructions are explained and pleasant to read. Clever and smart at full!
5,Love it.,This product does what it says it will do. The only down side is to wash by hand but it is so easy it really is a snap.
3,Good Cookware Set,"This set is well constructed, but the grooves inside the pots make it hard to clean."
2,Streaky,"They looked great online, but when I received them, the flower cut was cheap-looking & the color wasn't a rich red. Instead, it was an orangy-redish streaky color. Blech. Don't waste your money."
1,Yuck,This product doesn't taste all that great. It's really sweet and sticky. It's more of a mess than it's worth.I wouldn't buy it again.
3,Teflon blues,"I, too, raved about this pan when I first got it, about 14 months ago, and would have given it 5 stars out of the box. But after a year or so of daily use (and daily care! no metal tools, no high heat, you know the non-stick dance...), the surface has begun to wear. It's held up better than the el cheapo teflons from IKEA and other places, but for the price, I thought I'd get at least two years out of it! <sigh> Please, God, it's the 21st century! Help us ease the burden on the landfills. Send us long-lasting nonstick cookware!"
2,Health records,"Disappointed. 78 pages into the book and haven't found anything helpful in implementing an EMR/EHR system.If you're looking for an historical technology primer, this is it."
5,A wonderful experience,"This seller is the best! The address given was wrong but the seller was thoughtful enought to notify me. I sent the correct address and asked to be told of additional postage. The seller notified me ""thank you, but there will be no more postage"",and he was mailing the book back by priority mail. I received the book two days later."
5,It Helped!,"I suffered from small outbreaks on the mouth once a month before I used this product. No out breaks now for six months, I take one pill a day and I think it really helped. Lysine is supposed to be more effective for the entire immune system then Mallissa."
2,Laxative effect is too strong!,"It is not as good as the peanut caramel chew or the caramel peanut with nuts( taste like babyruth). When I bit into it the taste was rich and bold, but the laxative effect was really fast. I went to the restroom within 45 mins after eating this one. So I wouldn't recommend this particular candy to any new atkins dieter. LOL!"
2,"Small but mighty (gassy, that is!)","I have tried most of the Atkins bars and enjoy alot of them. I didn't realize when I ordered this one that it was only 1.2 oz, quite a bit smaller than the other Atkins bars - yet the same calories, etc. The taste of this one is good, but I'm only giving it two stars because of the size and because of the terrible gas that they give me. I'm not sure what is different in this bar than the others, but I'll have to compare ingredients and make sure I never get that ingredient again! Very, very bad - to the point of having stomach pains, not to mention the other undesirable effects of gas."
4,small but tasty,"these little bars are very small, but they do taste really good and do a fair job of satisfying your hunger."
2,OLD chocolate,"So disappointed. I love Atkins bars and when this order came, I was anxious to indulge. Well! The chocolate is so old it is nearly white. It flakes off the bar, as old chocolate always does. Funny, because the first 3 bars were fine and now I can't find one in the batch that is edible! Will not order this again."
3,Kicked me out of ketosis,"These bars are very yummy for a low net carb bar, but kicked me out of ketosis. I looked and diabetics count net carbs from sugar alcohols more conservatively than they are measured here. Ultimately not worth it for me."
2,Endulge Nutty Fudge - not their best,"I really love most of the Atkins bars. I think the brownie fudge has a strange aftertaste that doesn't ""natural"". The brownie caramel bar is much better option."
5,atkins snack bar caramel nut chew,"This is my favorite of all the Atkins bars. It is small (a great snack) and it keeps me in maintenance. I am 72 years young so I don't do much more than regular household duties and walking. This is my pleasure during the day when I just want a little something sweet. The calories aren't empty and I still feel as though I have a little ""guilty pleasure"". Also they taste wonderful! I like that I can get these with free shipping. Love Amazon!"
5,Atkins bars,Excellent! Tastes great. I wish they came in a bigger size they are so tasty. I would buy these again
5,So Good,"These are somewhat pricey and a little on the small side, but so delicious. Each bar is only 1.2 ounces, perfect as a snack with a cup of coffee with only 2 net carbs per bar."
2,Mixed feelings - Delicious but will stall weight loss,"I bought this bars because I am on the Atkins diet and I have a huge sweet tooth.The bars are absolutely yummy, however as soon as I started eating them I stopped loosing weight.I seriously eat nothing but Lettuce, spinach, eggs etc (items allowed on the induction face of Atkins)I am not abusing the bars, I eat one every other day or so, but I did notice that I stopped loosing weight right as I started eating them. I am upset since the bars say they are allowed in all phases.I looked up possible reasons for my problem and several forums talked about how Atkins bars made people stop losing weight.Of course everyone is different and our bodies respond differently to things, but this was my experience and for what I read many other people had the same experience as I did.BE AWARE."
4,"A litte better than ""I like it"", but no up to ""I love it"".","These were really pretty good. They are not at the top of the list for this type of product, but they are high on the list. Needless the say, the 12 bars did not last very long."
2,Hight calorie high price for size,"High calories 130 and price for the size bar. They are about the size of your little finger. The taste is ok. Also they gave me gas and the runs, because of the malitol so you might want to think of this if buying. I would not recomend more than one a day!!! Unless you want to spend your day in the bathroom."
2,Strange aftertaste,"I was disappointed in these bars, as they have pretty rave reviews on here. I found that they had a strange aftertaste, and overall the taste wasn't that great. I'd rather eat the occasional unhealthy bar that tastes good rather than a 'diet' bar, as these just didn't satisfy."
5,Caramel Nut Chew is a great product!,"I have tried other bars of this sort, but this is the best bar I have tasted.It does have caramel and nuts in it. I have bought numerous bars and will continue purchasing them."
4,Got a bad box,"I get this through subscribe and save, which is so convenient and cheaper than buying this locally. However, I recently received a three-box shipment that was not in good condition. All three boxes contained bars which had been squished at one end, so the caramel was stuck to the inside of the wrapper. The caramel was firm when I received it, so it may also have spent some time along the way in a spot that was too warm. This problem only occurred once over the half-dozen or so times I have received the same product."
1,Read the book,"If you truly want to do Atkins, please follow the book he wrote....if you look on the list of acceptable foods for induction..(if thats the phase you are on) most of the items in the bars and shakes are on the no no list.... and have caused some people to stall."
3,"Great music, disappointing video quality","Of course the music from the Vienna Boys Choir was great..... but I was very disappointed with the poor resolution of the video.Perhaps it was full screen cut out of a wide screen recording, blowing up a smaller part of the original to the extent that it was no longer sharp, or perhaps it was just a poor resolution recording or perhaps simply poor translation from the recording to the DVD. I don't know.But in any case, I am disappointed by the image quality and I regret not having simply bought an audio CD. For the price of the DVD I could have had a couple of the Vienna Boys' Choir's other audio CDs."
4,A Great Starter Deck!,"Although I have now been reading the Tarot for over ten years I almost never started! Like many who were put off by the Rider-Waite deck's colors and cartoonish 'flatness' I thought Tarot was not for me. That is until I got this deck. The rich colors and flowing movements in the pictures made it very easy for me to understand the scenarios and emotions conveyed by each card. The readings have always been very accurate with this deck as well. The only reason that I have not given it 5 stars is that it lacks an in-depth accompaniment book (probably because the imagery does not relate to other schools that would lend to a deeper understanding of the Tarot). Still, for the beginner, and even the expert, this deck is a delight :)"
5,"My first deck, and I lucked out!!","Everyone told me to start with a simpler beginner deck, but I was really drawn to this one and bought it instead. I'm so glad I listened to my instincts. I have gotten really great results with reading from this deck, and I feel I learned the tarot faster because I felt more connected to it. It has beautiful artwork and vibrant colors, and the pictures tell such wonderful stories. I would reccommend this deck to anyone, including beginners."
5,Yay for vibrance!,"For being my first tarot deck, this one constantly surprises me with how strong and accurate it can be. The colorful, well drawn images allow me to form my own opinions on the meanings of cards. Even to the point of getting totally different meanings from what the cards typically symbolize. I'm quite happy with the deck. Though I'm looking for other decks to tap into other information, this deck is my favorite of all I've encountered."
5,A superior card deck.,"This was the very first tarot deck i owned and i have been reading tarot for over 6 years now.This is my favorite deck. It is traditional in its format - major and minor arcana. The Art work is beautiful but i also find them accurate in doing readings. They have a good mix of looking into the future and looking inside yourself.Although it does not come with a book extensive book on the meanings of the cards, the little book it does come with has basic meaning to every card, but also a story that coresponds with the picture on the cards- to spark intuitiveness and not only rely on the book.I own a rider-waite deck and several other non traditional decks like Osho-Zen and Faerie Oracle but this deck out of my large collection is by far the best.I reccomend it for anyone beginner or advanced."
5,Art Nouveau Tarot Deck Review,"I Just Got My Art Nouveau Tarot Deck And I Love It! I Love The Size of The Cards. One Thing I Observed That Kinda Threw Me Off Was The Reversal of The Justice Card And The Strength Card. I'm Used To The Strength Card Being In The 8th Position of The Deck And The Justice Card Being The 11th Card of The Deck, So This Will Take Some Getting Used To. I Love The Hues of Blue In The Deck, It Really Seems To Match My Mood. I Think This Is A Very Beautiful Deck And I'm Glad I Bought It!"
3,Art Nouveau or no?,"This deck I bought on account of its unsurpassed beauty, but not for the mysticism. The cards were painted in oils with the glazing method and have the appearance of stained glass windows, that is all but the trumps. They look rather sexy, like in a popular women's magazine, but they totally lack any symbological reference, thus they are second rate as Tarot. A woman I met called them ""ladies cards"", and that may well be on the face of it."
3,Shaky Imagery but Very Accurate Readings,"I ended up with a mini deck by mistake.I was disappointed but I made a mini bag to keep in my purse for readings whenever wherever.The cards are very pretty and I love art nouveau. I was searching for looks over symbolism anyway. They arent jam packed with everything from Egyptian to Jewish mysticysism and thats ok. Too many decks out there try too hard and are nearly incoherent.I do free readings for friends. I was STUNNED at how accurate the readings were!!I'd do a Celtic Cross spread for a stranger and the results left me feeling a little ""creeped out"".I have never claimed to be a psychic and feel I let the cards speak for themselves. These cards really have alot to say!!I would recomend this deck for an experienced reader who does not NEED to reference the cards' symbols to give the reading. If you know the cards well then you will really enjoy the look for what it is and be surprised by how well they work."
5,Romance isn't just girl stuff!,"The beauty of a feminine deck created by a male artist is easily visible. In my experience, The Art Nouveau Tarot allows me to concentrate on the romantic questioner. Although I choose more traditional decks when asked more general questions, the stories and images in this deck are perfect for reading romantic love."
2,I do NOT recommend buying this deck!,"I bought this deck for the gorgeous colors I saw in the images of the cards on Amazon and other sites. Also, the pictures were evocative, if somewhat dramatic. I was prepared for the big hair and overstuffed codpieces. What I was NOT prepared for was the washed-out images on the cards. They look like copies of copies of copies. The colors are dull and the images are fuzzy. The facial expressions are unreadable. In short, I should have put them right back in the box and returned them. In fact, I'm going to see if I can because I really feel this deck is misrepresented."
4,I Love This Deck,"True, these cards might lack in the symbolism department, but if you are an intuitive reader, who needs to be reminded of a cards meaning by symbol prompts? The artwork is Beautiful and for more visual/ intuitive readers these cards will work just fine! I did three readings the first day I owned the deck and they were RIGHT-ON! If you are a fan of artwork, this is one of the more attractive decks to come along in a while!"
3,Art Nouveau Tarot Deck,"The deck is well done and the colors are very vivid. Some of the pictures seemed contrived, the faces mostly. Also the characters were wearing western (cowboy) boots which it made them a little less renasance like. The devil and death cards are pretty dark and scary compaired to the rest of the deck and seem a little out of place in the pack. Other than that the deck is good"
2,argh,"Alright, in all fairness I was fated not to like this deck. I wanted the Tarot Art Nouveau *not* the Art Nouveau Tarot. The deck I wound up with is colorful and nice eye candy; the deck is pretty traditional and most would probably find it a tasty alternative to the straight-up R-W deck.However, I for one am less than amused at the damsels clinging to their men. Argh Argh ack."
2,Great deck for the untrained eye,"This deck, though very beautiful... well... thats all it is. This deck is great for the people who just think of Tarot as ""A fun game"" For those of you who are expirenced tarot readers or are in it for the spirituality of it, then definitly do NOT buy this deck."
4,Coil winding; technique`s and machines to create radio coils,"Great book for the coil homebrewer who want`s to make his own radio coils and also wants to makehis own coil winding machine. Good photo`s and drawings to give you an idea on how to createa winder, the shape/ratio of gears and the shape of the cam.A great addition in theorie and how it all works, a very helpfull book for me.thanks[...]."
3,Corresponding,The scorpion is corresponding to which chinese horoscope. Date of birth: 26 of October 1999.
1,Nt what was promised,"This product didn't live up to the expectations given in the description. Hard to open, opened where it wasn't supposed to, and the cap came out in a mess. I used my washing machine. The instructions claim you can use this product in your dishwasher. Really? Wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,Hat washer a little disappointing,"Okay, I have been wanting this for a long time...the hat didn't stay put like I expected and bent up a bit...but I guess it will work as I don't have a whole lot of hats to wash."
4,cap shaper,"works well, would be nice to have some type of fastening system for the side of the unit. Other than that it is a nice product."
2,"Maybe OK, but not an answer for me","The product may deserve a 5-star rating, but in my case it didn't work. My wife put it in the dish washer under the appropriate conditions, but the process wasn't strong enough to remove the grime / sweat on the brim. Also, it left a soapy residue on the crown of the cap. I can't say with certainty that the amount of detergent was correct, that the detergent was the best for the job, that the temperature of the water was appropriate, or that the other things were done correctly, but I can say I'm not pleased with my results. I'll just have to buy a new navy blue cap."
2,DO NOT BUY!!,"I gave 2 stars but I was being generous, this product broke in several places on the first use. :'("
1,Not made to last!,"The Cap Shaper Washing Aid worked well on the washing of the first hat. However, when washing the second hat the Cap shaper Washing Aid came apart. It would be nice to find one that was well made."
3,Ballcap buddy,I ordered the Ballcap Buddy Aid-Pack of two (2) and only received one frame. Product code was X000B724F7. Still waiting for the other frame......Quality control?
4,Sweatmarks Are Gone,"I bought this to try and revitalize a couple of my favorite caps. It is simple to use and the dishwasher cleaned all the sweatmarks and most of the funk from my cap. There was some residual dishwasher cleaner (powder) just under the brim that I had to rinse off after, but it wasn't an issue. Maybe liquid detergent would work better? I will be using this again soon for a couple other hats I would like cleaned."
4,Cap Shaper snug fit,The Cap Shaper is what it looks like but my husband's average sized cap barely fits. After jamming it down on the base it was extremely difficult to close. The plastic is relatively thin so it flexed quite a bit when I closed it. I will still use it and it is a good idea but I would not expect to use it on a child's hat.
5,Work without any problems,"It Work i used on my laundry machine and it didnt break apart like other ones, will be buying a few more to keep my hats."
3,cap holder,"It does the job required of it. Takes a good tour around the washing machine, for a piece of plastic !!"
1,Cheap,"I bought this for my husbands hats thinking it would make it so much easier to wash them but the first time I used it the clasp opened up, the hat fell out and the bill broke. Wasted money on this product then he had to go spend even more on another hat, would not recommend."
4,"The item works as advertised, but...","If the instructions were available before purchasing, I would have known that this item is used with a dishwasher, not a washing machine. That would have been good to know."
3,Doesn't warrant rave reviews,"I don't know why all the shouting about this product. It is flimsy, one of the frame snaps comes loose during every washing. I wash in a top loader on the most gentle cycle and the cap comes out skewed in the frame and I have to straighten it for drying. I found the cage to be difficult to open. Maybe I'm a klutz at this sort of thing, but I think the open/close function should be easier. This thing probably works better in a dishwasher where there is no circular or back and forth movement, however I have found that just washing my caps in a top-loader on handwash/casual works just fine, they come out the same as when I use the BCW and you don't need a unit for each cap."
2,Good in theory...,"I liked the idea, but it didn't really work so well in practice. First problem, your hat's brim has to be completely flat to fit in this device. Mine are all significantly curved, and were made that way. The bowl shaped piece designed for the crown of the cap was too large for any hat that I've ever worn, even with the cap's adjustable strap completely unfastened. Oh well, nice try..."
5,Works Great...,The key is to just put the hat in the washer then put the hat on the cap rack to dry on top of the dryer. In a few hours the cap will be dry and back to a perfect shape. I never use the cap rack in the washer.
3,Cap Shaper,Work OK and is a novel idea for shaping the hat. Hopefully I will use more with my hate collection.
5,Great product,"I used this cap shaper to wash my son's baseball cap in the washing machine with a full load, and it worked great. I air dried it."
1,kinda silly actually,"Sorry to the makers of this, but you can just as easily put your hat in the wash without this and it will be just fine for the most part. I have done it several times. Unless the hat is a piece of crap, it will turn out just fine in the wash without this silly thing that you will end up selling at your next garage sale."
4,Haven't tried it yet..,...but good to have on hand for when I need it. I suppose I can update my review once I do.
2,Stopped Working,"When I first bought this, it worked fine. Now, my hat gets twisted inside it while it's being washed and it seems to come apart in the machine."
1,Gimmicky junk,"P.T. Barnum was right, there's a sucker born every day. Looks like I was one of them for falling for this piece of crap gimmicky hat washer. Folks, It doesn't work good at all. It comes apart in the washer, it's cheap, pointless, unnecessary and just plain retarded looking! The gimmick is that the hat, after washed, is supposed to keep it's shape. Who cares!? If you throw a hat in the washer without one of these, your hat will be just fine!! How do I know? I do it all the time! You don't need a hat washer, lol! Don't get suckered in like I did! Just save your money. The hat washer is a piece of s***!"
3,I didn't realize these books were so small--and abridged.,"These books don't have the same story as the big ones---even though the original story would have fit---they illustrations are the same and really nice, so my daughter likes to look at them but I don't enjoy reading them to her as much."
3,A classic with old photographs,I have three editions of this classic textbook.It doesnt match the new knowledge with the old photographs.Ultrasound photos taken from old equipment and upside down.I dont understand why the editors keep using old photos.
3,Not as great on the second box,I bought this bulk size package of Sleepytime based on three great cups of tea at a hotel. Loved the first dozen or so cups from this box too .... but now I'm thinking it's a little bit of a weak tea.tea is good ... but be really sure you like it before buying this much of it!
4,Bedtime drink,"It is winter time so I drink more tea than cold water.When I come home, it is time to wind down and drink decaff, better for my nerves and stomach.Also It wont' raise my blood pressure.Like some reviews, it does take time to get the flavor but I nuke it so it seems to come right out.Just to be sure I do let the bag stay in until I finish.This is a multi herb drink."
4,Bedtime Ritual,"I love Sleepytime tea at night while I'm laying in bed reading a book, winding down for sleep. It has a fresh, comforting flavor, and a really great scent. It is a main part of my relaxing bedtime ritual, and I make use of Amazon's automatic re-ordering program, which saves me So Much money compared to grocery store prices. I only gave 4 stars because after about a week of drinking it every night it kind of loses it's charm. That's when I alternate it with Celestial's Tension Tamer, just to keep things interesting. Great product for herbal tea lovers, and again, a much better price here than in the grocery stores."
4,Fair to partly Cloudy??? Still GOOD BOOK!!,I notice this situation alot.. sometime in these books they like to advertise easy to follow simple to understand complete instructions.. well this book is better than most I've seen but it still lacks detail on some of the projects.. the truth is most who buy pocket hole jigs are those who have very little woodworking experience and need that extra help in details of the book and plan.. some of the projects in the book are nice and are good starters. the book also brings home the concepts of the pocket hole jig... this would be a great book for a beginner.. however if you already understand how to use a pocket hole jig.. shy away and buy something more challenging.. Danny Proux .. does a nice job with this Book!!
4,Has nice projects,"I bought this so I could make a few projects with my Kreg pocket jig. I never did, I had so many other things to do with my Kreg I never got to this book. But that does not mean I cannot comment on its content. I have been wanted to make the clock for a long time, there are projects in here that a young person can manage. the instructions are straight forward and easy to follow, anything to do with the Kreg jig is easy. I will be using this soon, hopefully."
4,Itisjust want I was hoping for when I ordered it.,It is a very good book for the first time users of the Kreg Jig. Go step by step and no worries.
3,Good book for starting woodworkers.,"The book is well written and covers the basics well. I was hopping for a little more advanced projects. More advanced projects require careful placement of screws, such as those near a routed edge."
3,Learning to use the Pocket Hole tool,"Nice pictures, but the information is very basic. I bought the book hoping to find more advance projects and ideas. If you are a beginner to the PH tool, and it is a great tool, this book will help."
3,the trouth about this video!!!!!,"411vm is only a sk8 video geez! for price you could go buy a cheap sk8 board. or go to surf'in bird and get. i mean 19.95! too much 2 buy at AMAZON.COM and why not go out and get""the best of boards?"" or ""tao of skaking boarding""?"
3,Terrible range.,"RANGE TEST: The effective range of this device is far worse than it claimed. I got about half a mile before it started dropping off and only transmitted gibberish. About 3/4 mile and it stopped transmitting altogether. Switching channels did not improve anything. I guess if you use it within the same building then it could be very effectie. As a matter of fact, I have seen people used them in a Chninese retaurant and it worked really well for them.So depend on what you need it for. But don't think you can use it for more than half a mile.I will update this review as I test other features."
1,as bad as it can get,"This was a real bad decision. When people say it all in the name, they don't mean Motorola T9500R"
4,Fun Toy!,I love these walkie talkies. The sound quality is great and they feel good in your hand. I haven't had a chance to try them camping but am anxious to do so. Please note that 25 mile range is optimal when you are in a non populated area with no trees.
5,Necessary for noisy environment,"Don't buy the Motorola handled radios without this or the ear phone based product if you plan to use the radio in a noisy environment (particularly if they are required to wear hearing protection). Even with the vibrate alarm, our employees were often missing talk requests. With the clip on speaker and microphone, the sound is placed closer to the ears and is heard much easier. The radio also need not be removed from the worn position to talk back..."
2,Newer isn't always better,"I purchased these to replace my aging T7200's, but there is no comparison. The 7200's are far better. The 9500XLR have very poor sound quality (very tinny, like talking in a can), the volume doesn't go high enough, and the reception is poor. I spent a few days using these two models side-by-side and the weaknesses in these radios jump out immediately. I am happy to say that Amazon accepted my return. Don't make the same mistake I did. Look for a different model."
3,tempermental and barely ok on sound quality,"You can't just hand one to a friend or family member and go: between setting the codes; being sure to push the right talk button; being sure to speak clearly, and not too close to the mic; these are temperamental radios.The range is pretty good, but never what you want it to be.The sound quality is muffled and poor. You'll be repeating yourselves many many times to get the message across.All in all, it's hard work to use this product."
1,radios walkie talkie,"These radios do not go far as claiming to have the probe in open spaces (long plains), and ideal weather conditions and never took on the scope offered"
3,"Easy to use and sound good, poor range","Like all of these kind of radios, the range numbers are for situations that don't exist. So don't believe them! These say 25 miles and even under nearly idea conditions (mostly flat land, few trees, no buildings, and no other interference) they function at a small fraction of the advertised range, 2-3 miles maximum."
2,Very disapointed!,"The Motorola 9500 was strongly recommended. However the set that I received turned out to be a piece of junk. Very poor voice clarity and quality. We depend on our talkabouts for car to car close range communications and boat to boat line of sight communication both of which were very poor, to the point of just not using them, which put us in a very unsafe position at times. I did call Motorola and was informed that I was past the warranty time and they would do nothing. My recommendation is to buy a set of Midland 900 or 950s and have a quality set of communicators."
1,POOR Quality For MOTOROLA Get your act together!!,"I got these radios because I own two talkabout t5950's. I figured that I would upgrade to a newer better model. Was I wrong!!! They do transmit farther than my prevous model, but you can't understand what is being said. I am a loyal Motorola fan, but they had better step up the qaulity. I will be returning these radios and I will go back to the old stand-by for another year."
1,Wasted Purchase,Purchased two twin packs of the T9500R radio and the sound quality is so poor they're absolutely useless for transmitting. I can hear other radios well enough but any transmit attempts are not understood by other radios.Do not purchase!!
2,"Great brand, (Motorola) but record of problems.","This radio has adequate power and the audio to get out. I highly recommend radios will good power like these for the outdoors, rather than weak .5 watt FRS radios. I found them larger than many in this class, and a bit under powered at only 2 watts max, but OK.However, it should be noted that this walkie talkie tends to show up in the ""remanufactured"" sale list quite often. I suspect this as something to do with the audio problems that others have commented on, or it could be something else. If lots get returned and resold, it usually means something is systemically wrong with the design or manufacturing process. In any case, buy with caution."
3,Good Way to Keep in Touch,"I bought these radios primarily to take on a family cruise & overall was satisfied with them. I was able to track down family members or communicate with family members that stayed in another room pretty easily. The hard part was either the battery running out (need to recharge daily), or someone not having the radio with them, or someone not knowing fully how to operate it (it's not difficult). Overall it's a good radio for what it's intended to do."
4,Can't beat Motorola,Great price and loaded with man features.Hard to imagine not going with Motorola.
3,they work for short distances,"You get what you pay for! The final say is this people, these are great to play with and use in an area of oh, like 500 feet or so but really not good long range."
3,"nice radio, short range",These are nice radios with lots of useful features. The rechargeable Nicad batteries are a good feature. They are the right size and for family style radios they appear well built. I was hoping for a range of about 10% of what was advertized (2.5 miles) but around our farm the best I could get was about 1.5 miles. I bought them to use on a boating trip. Maybe over open water I will be able to get the 2.5 miles that I was hoping for.
1,Sewer Pipe Audio Quality,"Though the radios had some good features, the bad sound quality trumped all of them. I had to frequently ask for repeats because the sound was so bad, even at close range. I don't know whether it is really cheap speakers or bad processing but it sounds like you are talking down a long length of plastic tubing.There are other radios for under $100.00 that work much, much better.I just returned the T9500XLRs."
1,Sorely disappointed in low quality.,"After owning 2-way FRS/GMRS radios by Bellsouth, Cobra, and Motorola, Motorola radios were always the highest quality. They may not have been the best in every area, but they were always consistently high quality and they always worked. The last 3 models I've owned have all been Motorola.I purchased the T9500XLR (their current top-of-the-line 26-mile radio) the other day to replace my T4900s. I was appalled at them. The sound quality from the speaker sucks compared to the older, cheaper T4900s. And worse yet, the sound transmitted cuts in and out continually - at any range and at any transmit power. Whether in the next room or half a mile away, the sound was the same low quality with voices cutting in and out. No settings affected this.I ordered a pair of Midland GXT710VP3 radios instead. They're *way* better. They're what the T9500XLRs should be."
2,Works but limited,"The product worked but only about 500 yards. This may be due to trees, etc. I suppose in an open foield you might achieve long range conversation."
2,Great features but lousy sound quality.,I use two-way radios at work and on weekends and vacations. Until now I've been very happy with many different Motorola and Midland models. The T9500 has great features but the sound quality is lousy which makes it virtually unusable.
3,They are OK,"I have purchased Motorola 2-way radios in the past to use in our place of business. Because it was time to replace the radios, I read the reviews and purchased these.The biggest problem I have with the radios is the lack of clarity. It is very difficult to understand what anyone says.They hold a charge nicely, and seem to be sturdy, but if you can't understand what someone says, they don't seem to stand up to the hype."
2,flawed,"I purchased these radios a few months ago and essentially have been unable to use them. The voice clarity does not exist. No one is able to understand anyone. It cuts out sporadically. I would say that the distance is terrible also, but I can't tell if the radio is cutting out or I just can't understand anyone. Called MOTO and they actually confirm that there is a problem!!! with this and another new model. They recommended that I get the sx800r model! At first they wouldn't even take it back.Oh, the NOAA channels are great and CLEAR!?Design is also good."
1,Terrible audio quality,As many people have noted.. the audio quality of these radio's is terrible. I also had an issue with the radios cutting out on me and times when I had to turn the radios off and on just to get them to communicate again.
4,Nice but rather lightweight,"We bought this to replace a Circulon saute pan that was over 16 years old and it was rusting in the grooved interior. The original was all metal without non-stick coating. This pan appeared to be the equivalent with the coating added. I like the new saute pan both for even heating and for its durable non-stick coating. I have used it for over a year now. The one disappointment is that this is thinner or lighter metal than the original. Foods and sauces can scorch or burn more easily. The original was amazing for how scorching or burning were avoided, apparently thanks to the grooved Circulon surface in the bottom interior of the pan. I must be more vigilant now with this pan and I place it on par with other good saute pans I owned before the Circulon."
1,"This is a audio CD, not video DVD!","I had to wait three months for the order and When I got it wasn't a dvd at all, it was an audio cd of the twilight zone."
4,Dark 'n Spooky,"Lots of different views of despair lead to one centralized vision of a greater darkness. I liked the way all of this prose, althought by different people, seems to coagulate so well. There isnt anything I didnt like about this book, it's a chilling collection of some truly warped, and wonderfully so, people."
5,Wouldn't cook without them,"This is my second set of Circulon. We recently purchased a second home and this was one of the first items on the HAVE TO HAVE list. Heats quickly, easy cleanup - all together the best pans I have ever had. I just wish there was a lid for the 8 in skillet. Seems nothing in the set fits it."
5,great cookware,1st set came with 2 items broken but returning set was easy and amazon quickly replaced it and made the returning process so easy.................i love these pots.....they heat up quickly and are so easy to clean
5,A Batchelor,"I have had the ten inch skillet for about six months and it is by far the best I have had in my thirty-five years of cooking. I overheat it. I catch it on fire. It looks like new. Non stick is fine. A teaspoon of oil and nothing (I mean nothing) will stick. Circulon 2 is great stuff, period. I was so impressed, I wrote this."
3,question for other reviewers,"I just got this set and it appears that the packaging (cardboard) has rubbed on the inside surfaces of the pots and pans, leaving visible marks that don't wash off. Has this happened to anyone else, do you think it is a problem, and would you take the time and hassle to return it and wait on a replacement set?"
2,Anti stick coating wore of after 3 yrs,"I have had, used and loved these pans for 3 years. I hand wash them and DO NOT USE USE COOKING SPRAY ((it voids the warrenty and destroys the pans). At this point my 2 skillets, covered saute pan, and small covered pot all have no coating. I am sending them back to the manufacter for replacement with a 1 month wait. For the price and care I put into them I expected more. I cook frequently and I wanted good pans. thats why I spent the money for these. The metal covers are not useful as you can not see the ""doneness"" of anything you cook. I use glass from another set with these which proved to work fine. Also storing the bulky covers is a pan because they are so bulky. I do have a eariler model however."
3,Circulon 2,I liked how heavily constructed these pans were. I did not like the deep grooves along the inside of the pans. My sister-in-law has these and she said the grooves get stained after awhile and look really bad. I returned these pans because I did not realize they had the deep grooves inside. I chose another set of pans that I am very happy with. The one thing I can say is that the people at Amazon were excellent to deal with. They made my return easy and my new order was to my door in two days! I will buy from Amazon again!
4,Easy if borind,"The first book my Granddaughter read to me was a Biscuit book from school. She was so excited that I bought some more for her and for her brother next year.I am afraid I find these books boring, but they are easy enough to excite a first timer, and that is the whole purpose. I would describe the Biscuit books as reading level .50."
3,Does not have the magic without John,I am so disappointed in this recording. The tenors just don't have the same sound with one of them missing. I really wish they would re-record this when John is able to return. My favorite is Ronan Tynan! But the sound that I loved so well is gone. Just my humble opinion.
4,"Singing beautiful, mixing not up to snuff","The original was described by the performers as one of those magical performances. There was never a doubt that the vocals came first.The symphony is too dominant on too many passages in this CD. The vocals seem a trifle muddy compared to the original. Maybe if I had an equalizer in the system I could sort out the tracks, but I really think that this was mixed by someone who has done too much opera. Who cares how the words sound when they are in Italian?The words are important in Irish LYRIC verse. If ""Grace"" (from the first album) had been recorded this way it would fail to send the chills up and down the spine. After all, an ancestor of Bonny Prince Charles would have been responsible for the (fictional) orders to shoot that young boy. If you can't hear the words you lose the hope and the horror.No lyrics in the case liner either."
5,Tenners for Tenors,"This cd and video was my introduction to the wonderful ""Irish Tenors"". Seperately each is spellbinding. Together they are nothing short of magical. Finbar Wright is a dashingly romantic figure while Ronan Tynan is most compelling. Anthony Kearns will be a major star someday in the opera world. His voice is clear and strong. Wright's voice soars in songs such as ""Carrickfergus"" and ""Isle of Innisfree"". He seems a bit nervous which is understandable given he had only 10 days to prepare for this concert. He was asked literally days before the performance to step in for John McDermott. Thank goodness he did! The one downer for me was the appearance of John McDermott as his voice is not my cup of tea."
5,Another Great Performance from the Irish Tenors,"Despite a last-minute change in the line-up, the Irish Tenors have once again enthralled listeners with their choice of music, their voices, and their Irish charm. The past year has only improved their vocal technique and stage presence. The songs, whether frisky or melancholy, are a delight every time. Looking for MORE from these fellows!"
4,Funny but not Blue Collar Comedy Tour Quality,"Ron White is hilarious comedian. He gained notoriety on the ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" and was every bit as good as Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy. Since I enjoyed that show and very much enjoyed his major label CD, I looked around for what else was available. There was not much but this one did come up on the search.This is an earlier work. His timing is not as good and in his later work and his stories are not as funny but they are still very good. Some are also pretty dated. Unless you remember Olga Korbut and Nadia Comanech (?) as great gymnasts from the 70s and 80s Olympic games, some won't mean much.His style is somewhat abrasive but the sarcasm is more directed towards himself than towards others. That doesn't stop him from launching a few zingers at others but a lot of it is self effacing.If you like lowbrow, Southern style humor, you could do a lot worse than this one."
3,Ron White is awesome but this CD falls a little short,"Ron White has done some wonderful stuff on Blue Collar Comedy Tour and other CDs. Don't get this, get Drunk in Public or the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. It's a way better CD way funnier. Pick anonther CD."
2,Disappointing,"For those who've seen the Blue Collar movies, heard ""Drunk In Public,"" or seen ""They Call Me Tater Salad,"" there's little new here. It is interesting to see how White's delivery and on-stage persona have developed since 1990 (he admits both to smoking pot and some level of homophobia, both of which he now disavows), when this set was recorded.However, this CD points up how little material White actually has. While the bits have clearly been polished with time and experience, White seems to have done very little writing during the length of his career. As a fan of White's I find this sad, given his level of talent."
4,The Beginning of Ron White,"The CD was good in that it had some material he has not done in a while, but a lot of it is the same storylines he currently uses without the finese he currently has. If you like Ron White, this is a good CD to listen to so that you can hear how he sounded when he began doing comedy before he started touring with Bill Engvall, Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy."
2,Pop to the Dark,"After winning me over with her 1st CD ""Carmine Meo"" of Italian standards with a rock beat, this lastest CD enters into the dark with demonic songs about losing ones will. Gone is the beauty of romance from ""Carmine Meo"" to become its complete antithesis of the dangers of romance. Gone is the uniqueness of her singing voice & style to become another gothic pop star. Don't buy this CD because you like ""Carmine Meo"", unless your into antitheses."
2,Awful!,"I loved her first album and listen to it all the time, so I had expected her second album to be excellent as well, but it was a wall of undifferentiated sound, a mish mash lacking any form or melody, and her voice sounded thin and screechy. There wasn't a single selection that moved me as had the first album. This one feels forced and uninspired. I was surprised and disappointed."
2,"Occasionally clever, rarely interesting.","Being an admirer of Stephen Dunn's simple, potent work, I am surprised to see his name associated with this collection. Though the author manages to occasionally produce some interesting wordcraft, her work is mired in the pretentions that plague academic poetry, relying too heavily on references to classical works and mythology instead of more human elements. In addition, many of her works are too abstract, in my opinion, to really involve the reader. In summation, this collection is not one I'd consider a necessary or worthwhile addition to one's bookshelf."
2,Content minus form equals chaos,"This book, which appears to be self-published, could be a blockbuster if it were picked up by a reputable publisher and COPYEDITED! The author, who is from India, was an auditor at a UAE bank and clearly knows the inside scoop on this very corrupt country of seven sheikdoms. However, his command of English grammar, punctuation, and spelling of people's names is really horrible. Unfortunately, the book suffers not just from a lack of nuts-and-bolts copyediting but also from a general structural editing. He needs help with the overall organization and expression of his material. The presentation of facts is fairly chaotic, bordering at times on incoherent, and accompanied by many documents too tiny to read but not labeled or explained very well. I am very interested in the author's topic and greatly appreciate and respect him for what he is trying to do, but I must say that I regret having paid $19.95 for the book in this condition."
1,Not a manual--a personal collection of ideas,"This book is quite a disappointment. Instead of leading the reader logically through a primer on orthography (good typography) or providing a comprehensive reference book, this is a collection of idiosyncratic observations. (A high point is the day McLean dared to set poetry in sans serif type!) It has some illustrations of good and bad layout, but not enough for a layperson to be able to generalize useful rules. The book itself isn't very attractive, and it cannot be recommended as a modern introduction. Laser printers have made ""everyman"" (and everywoman) a typesetter, but this is not the book to lead you to better layout and design."
5,"a great break from the ""what to expect"" reading options","This book was a gift from a dear Aunt who understood what was involved in the birth process. During my pregnancy, I struggled to keep up with the daily reminders of what could go wrong each week...this book was a great relief from an obsession with information.I now give it as a gift to others.Thanks,Andrea"
5,A rare insight into the making of a drug.,"As a 43 year old woman who was diagnosed with Her2 positive breast cancer 18 months ago, I found this book by accident and am so grateful that I did. From the cover, you may think this is a rather dry, clinical type book that will require a certain level of medical knowledge...it is anything but that. It gives insight into the true, grueling and sometimes very political world of how a drug does or in many cases, does not come to market. Bazell does a wonderful job of telling a complex story that involves science and humanity and the delicate balance between the two. It will give you hope, it will anger you, it will educate you. It will remind you that there are dedicated, passionate scientists out there who's only goal is to find a cure despite all the road blocks put in their way."
4,Well written,"It is a really well written book. Interesting. It is easy to follow, but also is deep in scientific details. As a molecular biologist, working in cancer, I am enjoying this book."
4,Cheers to Bazell,"Bazell uncovers emotions and stories from patients, advocates/lobbyists, scientists and family members. It is a very moving story -- be sure to have tissues nearby as you read through the Phase I trials.It could be more well-rounded and present ideas from Genentech's viewpoint as well, and it does end faster than it should. If Bazell or anyone tackles an epilogue to Her-2, I would be the first in line to buy it.Kudos. A must read for ALL WOMEN."
5,A must read for anyone fighting breast cancer,"I wish I had read this book last year. I ordered while my sister was being treated with Herceptin for a recurrence of breast cancer. Unfortunately, she died before I could get the book.This book give real insight into the politics of cancer treatment - the passiveness of some oncologists, how an executive's own personal experience with a disease can determine if drug development will go forward or not, and how women are becoming more aggressive in monitoring their own treatment.Bazell talks about the frustrations of critically ill and dying women in trying to work through the medical, academic and managed care maze to get the treatment they need.This drug has been the 'magic bullet' for many women. It has been called the start of a new era is disease treatment. It is essential for anyone involved in this disease to read this book, to understand what they are up against and how they can help themselves."
5,A must read for husbands.,"My wife has been recieving weekly doses of Herceptin for a year now. A facinating story of how this miracle drug came to be.Reading about how Herceptin grew from a theory to reality, how the marketplace influenced development and the personalities of the people involved made this a real page turner, I couldn't put it down!"
3,Excellent ambient stuff,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a modern overdub of a classic live recording.That said, I think this is what TD has been doing since it's beginning. Ricochet is an excellent recording BUT is a studio overdub (with studio tracks included) of a mix taken from TD's previous European gig, and that doesn't make Ricochet a bad recording but on the contrary it's a masterwork. Other examples of TD's overedub action being, Encore, Poland, Tangents (compilation)and the 3 dream mixes.Soundmill Navigator does not deserve to qualify as a masterwork BUT it's an enjoyable fictional performance. Forget any expectation about listening to a historical record and you'll enjoy a kind of partially invented, or fictitious, live performance, mixing 21st century dubs with 30 year old synths.It's very spacey, ambient, if you like, so if you enjoy a more rhythmic TD this CD might disappoint you.Francisco"
2,Buy the Boxset Instead,"The concert on this cd (June 27, 1976 Berlin Philharmonie) can be found unaltered along with a bunch of other excellent, untampered concerts on the Tangerine Dream Bootleg Box Set Volume 1. This is an official release and sounds better than actual bootlegs or the mess that is Soundmill Navigator. Cheesy, obviously digital overdubs turn this cd into a wreck. The actual concert during the brief periods where you can hear it over the ""Tangentization"" is a classic. 1976 was a transitory year live for Tangerine Dream. They were beginning to bring some element of structure to their concerts. The freeform Moog freakouts were gradually being replaced by sequencers and the guitar noodling sounds suspicously like the opening chords to Pink Floyd's ""Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"". However, there is plenty to like, especially with their classic line up. Its a great concert. The band was in form that night (and many others). Soundmill Navigator is just not the place to buy it."
2,TOOOOOO BAD....,I bought this when it first appeared with real joy as I am a HUGE fan of 70's TD. I have to agree fully with Rubidion84's review. Yes its great to have a new live realease but its obviously doctored and has an awful clicking sound that starts about two minutes in and keeps going right to the end. If you have an equalizer u can get rid of the sound by dropping out the high end but why should we have to do this with a legit release!?? When they put together Ricochet they claimed to have listened to 50 to 70 hours worth of tapes. WHERE are those tapes?? Why release a doctored badly damaged tape?? There are boots with way better sound. They claim to have taped every concert they ever did- what the hell are they doing??
2,After 14 minutes...,"...then you get the real TD of Franke, Froese and Baumann. The first 14 minutes were the so-called Tangenization or what ever you term it. Froese overdubbed it with his usual effects as he always does on many classic TD tracks of the 70's and 80's, worse of all he even attempted to add more to the original performance by laying more and more modern instrumentation. The result was ranch sauce added to the apple pie instead of whip cream. Don't get me wrong I have every release of TD particularly the 70s-2000s and never missed the classic year releases but this one is a total disappointment. It cost me 25 plus dollars and this was really hurting. Buy this only if at $5 or less, still many are selling at a ridiculous rip off price on the used section. Read the other negative reviews they are not lying and if only I listened to them....."
2,A Puzzling Piece of TD History,"There are times when the artistic vision of Edgar Froese muddles what could be excellent additions to the TD music catalog; and this is on of those frustrating times.Overdubs and additional material adds about 10 minutes to this improvisational piece performed on June 27, 1976, in the Berlin Philharmonie by Froese, Peter Baumann and Christopher Franke. Here is a concert that drew critical praise and is an important foundation to the technological revolution of the band, but it is manipulated years later for release.Artists may complain about fans who seek out bootlegs to supplement their collections, but this album is a major reason why; failing to let the real music do the talking."
1,Confused? This is what's happened.,"There seems to be much confusion about this release, let's see if I can clarify the situation.The original concert that took place on the 27th June 1976 at the Berlin Philharmonie consisted of only one track which was 31mins 31secs in length. It's a justly famous performance and is out there in very good sound if you look for it.This means therefore that an extra 10 mins worth of overdubs and added sounds have been added. Presumably in order to make it up to a minimum length for an official release. Anyway the result is horrible and this is a totally misguided release.Hope that's cleared things up."
2,Short and old,"Unfortunately, this is another album that is released with recent date however was actually recorded in 1976. TD has a very bad habit of re-releasing music with new titles also this album is only 41 min.long. This kind of info should be passed on to customers BEFORE they purchase them. Although this music was historically ground breaking, it is a shame that TD tries to disguise this as a new release."
3,Women of the Third Reich,"This was a somewhat interesting read, well footnoted and researched, though at times boring. I was not pleased with the translation though, and wished I had bought the book in German instead. The translation can have a lot to do with the overall tempo of a book and how it is interperted. I will try it again in German and then make a final decision then."
3,"Good Research, Sloppy Translation","I'd already read quite a bit about the women this book is about, and still discovered some new information. The book is nicely footnoted (I'm the kind who always wants to know what a historian's source was). There are problems with the translation, however. The translator wasn't aware of traditionally accepted translations and says things like ""Time of Battle"" instead of ""Time of Struggle."" Every now and then, something seems a little off, and I'm sure that's a translation problem."
4,Plenty of fun!,"I am glad I purchased this game. I keep it in the car. My kindergarten friends like it, but they do have some trouble getting the game pieces into the pegs. Maybe as the game gets some wear, the pegs will be easier. The game lists two to four players, but only came with two game pieces. Hmm. I would say that would only be a two player game. All in all, I've been happy with this purchase."
4,A Good British 1950s Jazz Album,"Two excellent saxophonists (Vic Ash, tenor, doubling clarinet; Harry Klein, baritone) plus a solid swinging rhythm section, some good original numbers and one standard; all-in-all a strong and enjoyable CD. These guys toured Britain with Miles Davis, and he told them that they were good -- what more of a recommendation do you need?"
4,worth a look,"This book is a bizarre family album, a collection of photos of his family and their lower class existence inside their apt. in an Enlish project. Pretty amazing stuff, very new german photo-esque, with oversaturated colors, off-focus at times, and tons of emotion in every shot. Check it out!"
4,A very good recording,"Howie Shear is an amazingly complete trumpet player. He has excellent technique and range, using each with restraint (quite rare in trumpet players). Bopliography is a good example of his modern style of playing. I most like his use long his use of LONG phrases.The nine tracks are split between two rhythm sections. Five tracks for Jeff Berlin (Bass), Richard Drexler (Piano), and Danny Gottleib (Drums). Four for Chris Colangelo (Bass), Dave Ferris (Piano), and Tony Inzalaco or Kendal Kay (Drums). Each section does a good job, but their styles differ a bit reducing the continuity of the release.Rob Lockart (Tenor Saxophone) and Jacques Voyment (Trombone) share the front line with Howie. Lockart plays his angular lines with a lot of energy, while Voyment is more smooth."
3,Nice vibe,"Snoop's second single off R&G - ""Let's Get Blown"" is a pretty nice track. Like ""Drop It Like It's Hot"", The Neptunes steal the show here. The beat - produced by The Neptunes - has a nice late 70's funky vibe to it, and Pharrell laces a nice hook to compliment Snoop's pretty average rhymes. What ever happened to Snoop Dogg after Death Row we may never know, but if he has The Neptunes by his side all the time, he'll do just fine."
2,Not Too bad..Not Too Good,"this isn't completely wack but not a favorite of mine. Dont get me wrong Snoop is one of my favorite rappers but i think he is starting to sell out, remember 'Doggystyle' where he was strate gansgta, now look, he's rappin (and singin, wackly) with people like Pharell and Justin Timberlake (On his new song) I mean that aint right snoop, get your sh-t right. The beats are by the Neptunes (suprise) and aren't too bad, but Snoop sings on here and I tell y'all he cant sing god. Snoop needs to get back to hip hop."
3,Touching but gets boring,"This book has two sides:on one side it is a touching and impressive story of the writer's difficult life (from child abuse to AIDS) and the way meditation helps him.On the other side it is a meditation/Buddhism guide, starting brilliantly - comparing the Buddha's life story to every person's personal struggle for liberation but then gets repetitive/boring to the point where i simply couldn't read any longer.Had the writer focused more on his personal struggle this could have been an excellent book as there are many gems hidden in it's pages, too bad they are too far scattered."
5,Fun and emotionally educational,"A very fun and whimsical story that illustrates Lilly's emotional experience and how she deals with her emotions. I highly recommend. My 3 year old son loves it, and is a common birthday gift, especially for girls."
3,Book is great....company who sent it is not,"I love this book...but the company that sent it shoved it in a package that was too small. When I contacted the company, they did nothing about it. So if you are ordering a book from BearBooks....good luck!"
2,"I just didn't get it, and it was way too wordy","...and he said ""wow"" because that was just about all you could say... I don't get it, didn't like it and there are way too many words in the book for the level of the content / age of the kid targeted. Would not buy again."
