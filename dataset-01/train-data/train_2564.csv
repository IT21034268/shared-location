4,A great dvd,"This dvd takes some of the funniest episodes from the series. The Dvd is put together quite well and episodes are taped better than vhs. The only problem is with 1 or 2 episodes it splits for a quick second, but i would recommend to anyone who like any Lucille Ball items."
2,"Classic comedy, marginal video quality","These are great episodes, particularly the one with Mr. & Mrs. Milton Berel. Performed before a live audience, it's a pleasure to watch these two pros -- Lucy and Milton -- keep it together while certain props go awry and everyone else is losing it. You can sure tell the performers who've done live theater from those who haven't. The poor quality of these episodes is a mystery. They appear to be 16mm prints which makes them terribly grainy, contrasty, and soft focus. I'm sure the original negative was 35mm (theater quality). It's really too bad since a DVD transfer could have been made directly from the negative."
4,Music of a better time,"While Ellis was not in the same world of Jazz that I usually acquire, his arrangements harken back to my days as a child, and i didn't have to worry about bringing home the bread. I am reminded of David Rose, Jackie Gleason, and the liquid sounds of the great orchestras of the fifties. It was the era of glamor, of women that liked to be women, of 36-24-36. And when you danced with them you knew that you weren't to far from heaven. This is the music you wanted, to have, a well built, gorgous, as Sinatra put it, Mouse, in your arms. For the rounded jazz buff, this Ellis In Wonderland is a must. To understand music especially, of the Hollywood glamor era, it is truly an insite. The trumpets, versas the piccolo's, with the bari sax marking the 1's and 3's on 36-26-36, is genious. The bass Clarinet walking into Alone Together gives the feeling of anxiety, and the strings give the joy of being with the girl you were afraid to ask out."
5,Hey Mon!,I couldn't wait to play with this Calypso drum. Bought it for my son for Christmas and we play it all the time. Anyone who sees is has to try it out. It comes with an instruction booklet and a few songs. Not sure why I waited so long to buy it but I am so glad we got it.
4,Fun and portable!,"This is a great drum - although smaller than I thought it would be. Also the way it hangs on the stand is not the best. It works, but does slide off too easily and have to keep putting it back on. Makes a great sound and comes with easy to follow music so fun to learn as well."
1,muddy pitches,"I really tried to like this product. It's such a great price for ""trying on"" a new instrument. I'm savvy enough to expect some non-harmonic tones along with the fundamentals of steel drum notes, but this drum's pitches were realllly muddy. I even took it to my choir director to see if he could hear an accurate pitch, but he couldn't think of a way to use something with such vague tones. Sad, I returned the toy."
3,Very Small Wood frame broke first day!,"Sound is fine, I purchased it for my 3yr old to beat on-better than pots and pans!! Included drum sticks are quite small 6"" each. stand is a step above balsa wood-very brittle."
3,Pretty Cool,"But, for the price it needs better mallets/sticks. They are too short, and have only rubber sleeves on the ends. The drum attaches to the stand with plastic zip ties, which is also very cheap."
2,not happy,"The drum was surprisingly quiet which wasn't what I was hoping for. The stand was cheaply made and didn't seem like it would last unless I was the only one to handle it and not my children. It was more difficult to play then I was expecting. The notes are not positioned in order like they are on a piano. (zoom in on the photo to see)The drum is just a little bigger then your typical dinner plate in diameter and the drum handles seem tiny! The handles are just sticks cut from a wooden dowel that have little clear rubber pieces wrapped around each end.I personally would not recommend this for a purchase.I ordered this exact drum from another company, IQ Kids Educational Store, and one note on my drum was off in tune(drums are hand tuned). I returned the drum to be fixed but I had been so disappointed with the drum that I asked them to keep it and just return my money. It took 5 months to get my refund. Amazon would have given me much better customer service."
2,Poor Performance,"I received this charger with my Minolta Dimage s414. I was so excited to get a free charger, but now I know why it was free. I charged the batteries three times and then it stopped working. I'm only glad that this happened while I wasn't travelling in a remote area where it would be difficult to buy a new charger. I'm looking for a charger with better customer satisfaction."
1,Not Worth It.,The dang thing came off about an hour after I attached it. The clip mechanism is way too weak to hold even the weight of the tether itself. Save your money.
4,"Maureen, Friends and Family, and Cast of Thousands. And fun.","There's Maureen, named for Ms O'Hara; her rabbi, her family, co-star Hugh Jackman from ""Oklahoma!"" for whom all the females in her house put on eyeliner to see off to the airport at 5 AM, her acupuncturist, friendly stage-door street-people. She sings, dances, acts on the telly, movies, and stage, and writes about all of the above, usually simultaneously. All this in short paragraphs, frequently concluding with an unnanounced joke. And read all her others. You'll thank me."
1,Lipreading joke,Has nothing to do with learning how to read lips; I just don't know how to describe this book except it is more of a novel.
3,"Plays well, but I haven't found it's place yet","This harp is supposed to be for playing melodies in Cross harp (2nd position). It is tuned similar to a regular G diatonic, but replaces the D at blow 3 with an E. This is useful. It messes up blues chords, but lets you easily play an E note rather than having to bend the 3 draw down a whole step. But they tune the 5 draw up a half step to C#. I don't like that at all. I use the 5 draw flatted 7th note all the time, and now it isn't there. This harp will work if you're doing a tune in D-major and it isn't bluesy, but I play blues and a lot of stuff in minor keys. Doesn't do it for me. If that 5 draw was a C, I'd probably love this harp, but the C# ruins it for me."
4,A Book for the Youngest Readers and Cat Lovers,"This book uses repetition and easy vocabulary to tell the story of a little girl and cats. Simple enough for even beginning readers, this is sure to please young cat lovers everywhere! The illustrations complement the words nicely and make it appealing to young children."
2,not very chime-y,"We bought this highly-recommended item for our 4-year-old son. He liked it OK and banged on it for a while--but some of the chimes were muffled and ""dead"" sounding, out of the box, so the appeal was limited. It wasn't too long before he gravitated back to his other, more melodious instruments. Oh well!"
5,Reality show at it's best!,This is really great watching. Getting an inside look inside Buddy's bakery is an eye opener into running a world-class bakery! Great entertainment!
4,A beautiful pictorial overview of the Mayan culture,"Through gorgeous photographs of ruins, murals, figurines, pottery, and other artifacts, Laughton guides the reader through an introduction to the complexities of Mayan society. He touches upon topics as varied as sacrifice, glyphs, sports, and the significance of the jaguar. But this book's strength is not the concise text. THE MAYA is primarily a visual look at the Mayan culture - and here it excels.At 135 pages, this is not an exhaustive book but rather a brief overview. Readers wanting an in-depth exploration of the culture should look elsewhere. Those who simply have a curiosity about the Mayas, or who love the visual impact of antiquities, will enjoy this book immensely."
1,it's a pity...,"...that the orbit experience didn't make more out of this!I first heared ""orbit in moscow"" on internet radio and my first thought was - WOW! That track certainly caught me. A very good modern jazz sound, which has that groove and rythm.So I went to amazon to look for anything else of that supposedly great new jazz band - little did I know what was coming....Already the second track put me off. I hoped for the third, but was all the more disappointed... apart from a bad mixure of tempo, beat and music generaly - the worst part is the spoken text - simply terrible! Not because its german (it would sound awful in any language) but because of the way it is performed it takes the last bit of pride which is left to the music...Never the less I think the first track is great and I luv to listen to it, the rest however is not worth spending 17$...ps. if you're looking for good modern jazz I recommend the bobby hughes experience or les hommes"
4,Hyaku Shiki,"This action figure is very detailed, yet isn't very durable. Comes with a great deal of accessories though."
2,Weak figure behind a Shiny Armor,"This hyaku-shiki may look pretty nice in picture, but in reality the guns don't actually fit in the hands very well. I ended up putting them in an akward, slighty pointed downward pose. The feet would also keep falling off whenever I try to turn or move it. The cannon doesn't really fit right when it's stored in the back of hyaku. Overall, I would not recommend this figure to those who wants to play with it a bit, instead of putting it in display which lost the meaning of ""action figure""."
2,Crunch Time,"This album is acceptable except for ""What's Going On"". They should have done another take but probably didn't have time. It sounds like McGriff was playing it for the first time; there is more than one instance where he drops the bass line (leaving a big hole), almost as if the organ was malfunctioning. Other albums better represent the McGriff- Crawford efforts."
5,The Best Little Book,"Out of the ton of books I bought, this was the most practical, down to earth and easy to access in times of trauma! we now have it at Pre-school and use it constantly. If you can only buy one, buy this......you will use it again and again."
2,"Decent, but not the best book out there....",Doesn't have a lot of info that I didn't already have in other books that were not toddler specific. Would be OK I guess if you don't already have other baby books that cover through age 5.
1,Did not work,"Purchased this item to allow for the Digial Optical Audio cable to fit better with a wall mounted LCD tv. I test the audio without the adapter, and it works fine, once I connected this adapter the audio just went intermittently out every other second. Not sure if the one I received was defective, but it did NOT work. I was not happy with what arrived at my home."
1,Simply doesn't work,"I ordered three of these because I thought they are such a simple part that they can't not work. How wrong I was. I've tried all three adapters with two transmitting devices (a PC and an Apple Airport Express) and in all cases my receiving devices (a surround sound processor) reports ""Digital Error"" when the adapter is introduced into the signal path.I tried shining an LED torch through each adapter and I can see that light passes through, but it must be with some significant attenuation or some other problem that causes the error in the signal. Whatever reason I'm going to have to dump these adapters."
5,right angle fiber/TOSlink adapter,Needed this adapter to connect into a wall mounted sound bar. Not much clearance in the back so this adapter solved the problem beautifully. The 360 degree swivel is a nice touch. Happy with the item and received in a timely manner.
3,Great for the right application,Product worked as designed if connected directly to a receiver. My only complaint that brought it down from a 5 star was that the plastic trim is a little thick (right around the bend) to where the adapter couldn't snap into to my keystone wall plate so the signal would carry. Given a 90 degree connection would be implying some kind of tight installation I would hope that the design would make it a little more flexible. If they extended the end just 1/2 mm the product would have most likely worked great.The problem very well could have been due to my wall plate. Great idea that hopefully gets refined in the future.
5,BOSWELLS TERRIFIC,"THESE sisters are every bit as good, if not better than the Andrews, the McGuires. Very talented and wonderful harmonies. Listening to these gals is a joy and takes you back to the 40's in style!"
3,DISSAPPOINTING,I felt it left out all the cruelties that Stalin did to his own people and I felt that was an important fact that should have been brought out.
4,Very Good!,"This scientific approach to a flat stomach is logically presented and fairly easy to read and understand. I've been using some of his principles (the super hydrations technique and the exercises) with some success.There are two reason why I didn't give this book 5 stars: 1) The diet is just too rigid. I mean very rigid. You have to buy a certain brand of bagel and THAT'S IT. There were no substitutions on the menu. I can't live like that. And 2) There was very little about a maintenance program to follup up with. The exercise program looked progressive, but the diet part of it wasn't."
5,Re Dennis Rogers' review / comment about slow weight training,"Dennis, I very much doubt the research you are referring to were the results between someone training the old dark ages way that most people are shown to use (lots of reps and sets 3 or more times a week, and throwing the weights around, i.e., using momentum to do most of the work for you) VS the SuperSlow protocol (twice a week max with a licensed SuperSlow trainer on low friction Medex weight machines where weight is moved in a straight, slow & controlled fashion until muscle failure, and then held another 10 seconds).If you have never personally never trained with a SuperSlow trainer, then I invite you to try it for a month. You just might reassess your attitude about it and find your strength improves remarkably, and that you feel much better. You might even have an epiphany (as I did) as to why doctors and physiotherapists refer patients to Super Slow trainers... for a start there's far less risk of injury."
2,must learn FRENCH first!,THE DVD WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH! WHOEVER WROTE THE AD WAS HONEST BUT WHAT HE/SHE DID NOT SAY WAS IT ONLY WORKS DURING THE TRAILER!THE ENTIRE MOVIE HAD NO SUBTITLE!
2,Subtitles do not work on this release.,"I own 5 different players capable playing of dvds and none of them are able to access the english subtitles on this disc, which is a great shame because I now own a film which I loved the first time around but can never watch (and understand) again."
1,It was probably a good film....,"But it was hard for me to tell, because the subtitles didn't work on my copy, or the next one I got....."
1,Lousy Film by a Brilliant Filmmaker,"It is so sad to see such a brilliant filmmaker (and so many talented actors) create such a stupid, incoherent, pointless, unfunny, meandering, clichéd-filled, hodge-podge of a film. It is horrifying to witness the indignities that she imposes on her poor actors (particularly Jeanne Moreau). How is it possible that the same woman can create such brilliant, insightful and truly beautiful films (like Vagabond and Cleo From 5 to 7) and then also create such lousy ones (like 101 Nights and Kung-Fu Master)? Does she have an evil twin? Is she schizophrenic? What is going on?"
2,Not Widescreen,"I would love to have a BluRay quality DVD of Hawaii, as we went there earlier in the year, but I would not want a 4:3 picture (1.33:1)."
5,"Solid build, similar to OEM","Perfect fit for '07 Accord. It is well build and weights about the same as the OEM. Not like the cheap FRAM filters. However, Honda engineers made this more challenging than most other manufacturers. You have to remove 4 screws, 2 of which will require an extension as they are in very tight places. The top is difficult to remove, you literally have to yank on the filter to get it out and push hard to get in back in the little space. Perhaps its due to the screws, there were very little dirt inside the filter housing."
3,Front wheels break easily,I bought and assembled these for my son's school and it worked fine (as described) for about two weeks. The lid looks and is heavy and can slam someone's fingers but you can tell that from the picture. One problem with all these ball locker carts (the school has two others) is that the front caster wheels invariably break off after a couple weeks of usage. They are just built too weak. They need to use larger stroller wheels or something. If they hit bumpy concrete or kids mess with it - they are guaranteed to break. Ours is now limping along missing its right front wheel; the replacement was bent up within days.
3,Could have been better,"I thought the set-up for this book -- gangster on the run in mexico disguised as a priest -- was better than the actual payoff. In a way, the author tries to do too much by bringing the story into the late-60's, tacking on a political coda that doesn't fit the earlier tone of the book. But it was well written and ambitious."
3,You have to be an expert,"Being an avid 'winey', and an Australian, I was excited to receive the bible on Antipodeon wines. Well I was a little disappointed; If you are thoroughly versed with the regions in Aus and NZ, then this is perfect for you; But being 8 years removed from my country, I discovered that the lack of info on specific regions was a negative for this publication. I find Hugh Johnson's guide a far more useful tool(although he does not reference the wineries as thoroughly)."
4,Great for the reference shelf,"Okay, the book doesn't answer every question you'll ever have about solar transits; still, it's a great item for the reference shelf. Astrologers like Frances [and Louis] don't come along every day and you'll be doing yourself a favor if you pick up a copy of almost anything she has written. For beginning students, this is an opportunity to see how an experienced astrologer interpreted one of the many components of chart interpretation; for experienced astrologers it is a chance to spark your own thoughts, reminding you of what you already know."
1,Confetti,I was disappointed because not what I thought it would be. The comapny has contacted me for full refund. What a great company!!!
5,Great speakers for medium spaces!,"I believe that these speakers are INCREDIBLE. I have this setup in my living room. My living room isn't huge, but it's not small either. The speakers fill the room with a solid and very clear sound. The highs and mids are GREAT and the lows are especially strong. It is AMAZING how much sound comes out of a system so small. You can hear EVERY detail from any movie you are watching from a pen drop, to any type of explosion. In my opinion, for the price and size, there is no better setup than the Bose 3-2-1 system."
3,A more than little disappointed.,"I was wondering if I was the only person who didn't like my BOSE. Who knew?As most of the other reviewers I purchased this item after listening to it in a store. It did have good sound, but not technically ""surround sound"". I've had numerous problems with the DVD drawer and last night, after one last round with it, I snatched it from the entertainment center and literally HURLED it onto the floor after 5 years of this. Good riddance. No headphone jack. Can only play one CD at the time, and not worth the original price. I've learned my lesson. My friends have the megaexpensive BOSE home theatre and it is certianly worth every penny from what I can tell. But the 3-2-1system.......NAH. Go buy something else."
1,Made in Chinaaaa !!!,"This product has Made in Chinaaa all over it. Non-functioning DVD player ... a Chinese specialty. BUT is has Marketed in USA all over it as well - with big promises, hi-profile TV advertsising, etc. The profit margins have to be ENORMOUS !!! So line up all you ""audiophiles"" and buy this trash."
1,I used to love BOSE till I bought the 3-2-1,"The sound is really good. It's definately BOSE quality in that department. The only problem is, if it won't play your DVD's or music then there's nothing to hear anyways. We've had all the same problems with the DVD player not reading discs, turning off partway through and last night we watched a movie and this morning the system won't even turn on. We've had this one repaired once and now it's broken again. Definitely too high of a price for something that's not going to work. If you're set on getting a BOSE system, I would get one just for the speakers and then get a seperate DVD player and CD player to actually run your media out of. We will be replacing our system with something else and it would take a lot to convince us to buy a BOSE again."
1,Don't waste your money,"BOSE is just a name any more. They are riding on a reputation built decades ago. I was shopping hard for a compact 2.1 system and after side-by-side comparisons, ended up buying a Klipsch CS-700. The Klipsch CS-700 blows BOSE away in all aspects. That system is in an entirely different league for the same price as BOSE. Bose sounds so tinny and ordinary in comparison. The Klipsch CS-700 remote is fully compatible with Logitech's Harmony remote too. It has headphone connections too (BOSE 3-2-1 doesn't!).In terms of setup, both are pretty straightforward. Though, CS-700 with its wireless subwoofer connection, gives great flexibility to place the subwoofer in an 'ideal' location in the room.So before you blow your money on BOSE, check out the CS-700. You'd be glad you did. The only surprise for me was that Klipsch is hardly advertised or talked about when compared to BOSE."
1,Can you spell LEMON?,"The subwoffer stopped working after a short time. Actually, I am not sure it ever worked properly. The Bose rapair center says it works fine. It does not. A waste of good money."
2,Not What They Want You To Think,"I saw this product on TV and thought wow, this will give me 5.1 sound with just 2 speakers! I went and purchased it and found out the hard way how disappointing this is. You will not get anything near a 5.1 system with these. Granted the speakers are good quality for a 2.1 set up, but sucks as a total ""5.1 home theater"" system.The woofer is horrible, the universal remote does not work well, and the set up menu if not user friendly. There are no HDMI ports, just one optical. The rest are components. For the price, this is not worth it.I ended up returning this junk and getting a Sony HT-SS2000 and am totally blown away by it. It is a hundred times better and over half the cost of this Bose.Do not waste your time with this product, but instead do your research and get something just as good for a lot less."
1,There are far better options out there,"This thing really is garbage. It's borderline impossible to watch a movie without it freezing up. I had numerous conversations with Bose about the problem and they kept sending me updates that were supposed to fix it. The updates didn't work and the process dragged on for weeks of me not being able to watch movies. It really doesn't matter anymore as there is far better technology out there and I doubt anyone is ever going to buy another one of these, but I figured I would add my two cents. The sound isn't even all that great. My first and last Bose purchase. So disappointed."
1,Don't buy! Very Disappointing! Something better may be in your dumpster!,"If you buy this with the intention to watch movies...do not buy it. The DVD portion is horrible quality. It locks up CONSTANTLY! Our 10+ years-old Toshiba DVD player is more dependable than this. If you think you are getting quality with the Bose name, forget it! BTW, buy your speaker stands at Walmart for $40. Bose should give everyone their money back and STOP selling this item. It locks up and overheats, and we suspect the heat is destroying our DVDs. I put in a disc in the morning to start my day out right with Yoga, and I end up furious and frustrated because I want to throw the player out the window. So much for my moment of zen! We garbage-picked a Samsung and it is great, so much better than the Bose. You will be disappointed with this item!"
1,the worse stereo system I ever had,"the system stop to work after few hours, then I have to turn it on again, DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY"
1,Has problems reading CD/DVD - Bose is not worth the money,"I bought this system at the Bose store for $900.00. More than a year later, the system started to have issue reading the CD and DVD. Very often, it does not recognize mp3 cd. When that happens, I have to unlug the power cord to reset it, otherwise the dvd player won't work with any CD/DVD. I tried to do something about it, but Bose only guarantee it for one year. The sound is good, but the unit is really not worth the price. I am really disappointed at Bose. I have read other reviews, but didn't really care until I own one. It was a bad mistake buying this Bose system."
1,Run away from this peice of garbage!,I thought mine was a lemon from the start but from the other reveiws I see I am not alone. I sent it back for repairs in the first year. (a piece of inards came out with a dvd when I ejected it) It has major problems reading discs of any kind. Currently it will not play DVD's at all. I now have a $30 player for that. A few months ago the volume went out. I now play everything at 60 or 70 volume where 30 used to be loud. Not so bad except that every once in a while it realizes where it should be and blasts for a second or two. Scares the you-know-what out of everyone especially the dog! Latest problem is one of the speakers (or wiring) is on the fritz. It constantly goes in and out. Did I mention that the screws that hold the wires into the back of the amp lost their thread bolt inside of the amp within about a year. Nice thousand dollar paper weight...
2,"Not worth the money, poor sound, poor performance","This system is not worth $900. The sound does not fill the room like a true surround sound system should. Disc always get stuck in system you need to unplug it and plug it in again for the tray to open, and half way through a movie it will stop and say ""can't read disc"". save your money, I brought a less expensive system too replace it and I am very happy."
1,Returned in 2 days,"I returned this product in exactly 2 days. My bad for not doing the research and looking at reviews. I bought this based on the store demo and the Bose name and reputation. The promise of an easy hookup, minimal wiring and only 2 speakers had great appeal to my wife.I could not get video on some of my DVDs (which apparently a common complaint on the boards) and those that did get video were very pixelated. The sound played off my cable TV was very uneven. The unit utilizes S-Video and has only 1 optical input and 1 coaxil input.As soon as I read the reviews, it was clear that this product has been less than stellar and for $1000, I was not taking chances. My $65 DVD player does a better job with an HDMI hookup, my old receiver (purchased in the late 90s) has more optical inputs and I stuck it out with my old system as unsightly as that seems to my wife.I think there is a market for this type of product, but poor execution here by Bose."
1,disappointed customer,It seems all the negative reviews were exagerated until i bought one... now i realized the importance of these reviews coz im one of the victim that spent a thousand dollar that didn't deliver what im expecting for. In the middle of watching movies (BOSE) it just stopped and ended up using my APEX dvd player ($30) that do the completion of my satisfaction. The sound is good when there's a crashing and some violent action happening other than that everything is just alright. I compared this to my friend's home theater (Energy rc-micro 5.1) he got it for $399 and it's far better. I am no longer a BOSE sound fanatics. There's a lot of cheaper and better sound nowadays. Buying this product is just buying a name. Hope this will help on your purchase.
1,Worst speakers I have ever owned.,I purchased Bose 123 GS speakers partly because of the hype about Bose products. The speakers do not work and the company does not stand behind their product. Page 55 of the manual states if the speakers cut out unplug the acoustimas module for one minute and plug back in. This happens constantly and if you are watching TV you will have to do this many times. I called the company twice and was told this was the cable companies fault. I have had the same cable company for twenty years and numerous kinds of speakers and never had this problem before. Bose knows about this problem because they have it in their instruction manual. I am out $1000 and I will never buy another Bose product.
2,dont buy it,"this product has agreat sound but thats about it,i have a 30 dollar dvd player thats more reliable than this...if i can do it all over again i c would just buy the speakers with another system"
1,A lemon of a system,This system sounds great when it works! I bought this system a year ago(July 2007) and have experienced numerous headaches! After experiencing spotty playing on cds and dvds Bose replaced my original unit. Four months later the system they sent me is having problems (my cds play intermintedly). Now I have to send my second amplifier into Bose to be fixed!!! When you pay $1000 for a system you expect more! I have been majorly disappointed with this system. I have never had so many problems with a stereo system. I would look elsewhere if you are considering buying a Bose 321.
2,Poor Value for Price,"I have owned the 3-2-1 system for 1 yr, 1 month and 1 week. The DVD player had to be replaced after 6 months of occasional use. Last week it failed to operate again, 6 weeks out of warranty. Also, no audio from the cable/sat setting ! The audio from my plasma TV speakers is equally as impressive in my LARGE living room. The AM/FM gives poor quality reception compared to a simple kitchen am/fm under the cabinet! DVD players are not expensive. I was impressed by the demo at the store, with a Bose DVD- at home it left me cold. Like PT Barnum said, 'there is one born every minute' Be smart and avoid this product and shop for a decent dvd/sound system."
2,poor value,"Bose is like a gourmet restaurant - small tasty portions but hefty price tag. If you want to have your stomach filled, you have to pay a lot!The speakers had sound separation and was clear, but that was about it. There were almost no features after that. To get more features, you have to pay double the price for one of the entry level Lifestyle systems!It was not surround sound as claimed. My wife felt it sounded thin; though I thought the sound was clear.We returned it to the store and bought a Sony Bravia HDX 501 instead (for half the price of this Bose), which we are very happy with."
1,Don't Bother,"I owned this system for 9 months. The single worst home electronics investment I've made in 30 years. The DVD player choked on brand new DVD's constantly. ""Cannot Read Disc"" or 5min+ pauses ruined more family movie nights than I can recall. I couldn't get Bose customer support to respond to me. Ever. It's exapandability and connectivity are miniscule. It was not even possible to buy a functioning DVD player to plug into it and salvage the investment. The ""surround sound"" is a joke, but I never realized it till I replaced it with a real 5.1 system. Seriously - don't even think about it. Friends don't let friends buy Bose..."
1,"Have 2 OF THESE, BOTH BROKE!","I have two of these systems. One in livingroom and one in basement. Both of these have the same problem....watching dvds is a nightmare. They both freeze. I have had one repaired, but am not wasting any more money with BOSE. They sound really nice when they work. The company is not taking responsibility for these units and mine says it is made in Mexico. Another company making tons of money and paying nothing for cheap labor......My $30 Colby from Walmart is way more reliable."
4,"DVD console broke, was repaired, 8 years running now","So, this BOSE system was a bit quirky when i first got it. The DVD system broke, BOSE repaired it for free (out of warranty), since the repair, I've had this system for 8 years and its great. 2 speakers and subwoofer, so clean and simple.I don't use the DVD anymore as I have a bluray player, but we occasionally put a CD in it to play music.If you have problems with the speakers, BOSE recommends you unplug everything and plug everything back in a certain order. We haven't had to do this in 5 years...but when we did have to, it was a pain.Mine does not have the HDMI but at the time, HDTV's were like a million dollars so it wasn't important...still isn't actually."
1,from the devil,"If you think this is a dvd player, you are wrong. It will sometimes play dvd's, however sometimes it will not. I have returned the media center for repairs 2 times in the first six months. I now possess a new media center--still skips and stops on its own. Bose was not receptive to my problems and required threats of legal action to exchange it.If your life is perfect and you need something to spice it up, please try this product. It should take a couple of years off your life."
1,"Poor, Waste of money","Well, I had Bose 321 for about 2 years, never felt great or worth the money. When they came out with 321 GS series, I called the Bose sales department to check, what are the improvements? Needless to say, tons of changes and improvements is what they said. After I bought the system, honestly I did find any damn changes or improvements, only change is speakers are small.Negatives issues:Sound: bit of distortion and humming noise, sent to bose for repair twice, (not solved).DVD Player: Does not work most of time.Remote control: worst, you have to point it directly to the media center, if not it will not work.Subwoofer: is ok, not the best.Positive feedback:System looks pretty and simple.Will I ever buy another bose product? Absolutely not, I take no pleasure in fooling myself beyond second time."
1,Junk,I can't get within 6 inches of the bulls eye at 10 feet from the target. I can't return it because I ordered it with a Crosman 357 that was also defective and by the time I got that problem fixed through the autherized repair shop 30 days had passed.
3,Could be quieter,"This appears to be an exact copy of a heater Home Depot was selling 20 years ago under the Patton name. That thing became a squeaky, rattling harpy after a year but it gave out lots of heat so i lived with it until it finally dies.This version has more fan noise initially than the Patton and something is already slightly rattling inside. I think the heating filaments are what does it so it's not like you could go in and tie anything down.It does give out lots and lots of heat however and I salute whoever had the foresight to put a 240 volt outlet in this room in this old house because there'd be no way to heat it otherwise.It has a sticker on the top that says ""Warning: Risk of fire. Do not use as a residential or household heater.""Make sure there's nothing near it that can catch fire."
4,Works very well,"Not too many 240V heaters out there. THis one works well, throws out a lot of heat. It does not ""blast"" you with hot air - the fan seems to force the air out at a ""medium"" speed. I got it to quickly heat up the room when coming home from work and it certainly does that!Gave it 4/5 stars because I thought you could adjust the fan speed - you can not. It does have a thermostat to regulate the unit on and off . THere are no ""hi/med/low"" type of settings for the heat - you just turn the thermostat knob and feel the heat. Overall great little heater."
5,"effective heater, lasted 25 years","I got two of these about 15 years ago for heating a garage, and they were 10 years old when i got them. Mine are branded Rival - but they are the same heater as this one. After 25 years one of the motors burned out this season, so I'm down to one. All in all I'd have to say that 25 years of winter operation in a dusty garage is pretty good performance.As some of the other reviewers have noted, the fans are a bit noisy. The thermostat works well and seems to hold temperatures well. These units put out a lot of heat! I'm satisfied."
3,Good Heater; Needs Better Thermostat,"The things I like best about the Fahrenheat PT268 are the industrial look and the fact that it produces a good amount of heat. I use it for my main heat source in my 950 square foot home, along with smaller 120 volt heaters to help warm other areas. Even though the fan is a little noisier than others I've tried, I can overlook that for the money I save by not operating my furnace. What I dislike most about the heater is the thermostat; it just doesn't have enough sensitivity to maintain a constant temperature. I don't care for a 3 degree fluctuation in the temperature. The manufacturer seriously needs to consider adding a digital thermostat to make this a great heater."
5,Be warm this winter !!!!,"I had one of these a long time ago and then I couldn't find them. Thanks to the internet, I bought two of them. If you have and old house with 220v in your bedrooms and living rooms, get one of these. They are so quiet you can't hear them running. They heat a room in a few minutes. I highly recommend them for your garage or your house. Great shop heater."
4,Excellent Book That Encourages Child Participation,"My Daughter has loved this book since she was 31/2 months old. She loves touching the objects, especially fluffy teddy and the red velvet dress, but hates the feel of the sandcastle. She cringes when we get to that one. The objects are grouped together with similar things like items you wear. It is a truly interactive book that encourages child participation. There is one object you can feel on every page which delights my daughter and frustrates her at the same time. She tries to touch the other objects on the page and seems disappointed that they are only made of the cardboard the pages are made of. I would have given this book 5 stars except I feel a few more items should be made to touch."
2,DANGEROUS - sponge touch and feel spot is easy to pick out and eat!,"I'm giving this 2 stars because while it is a fun touch and feel book full of great pictures and fun textures, it has a bath sponge spot which is super easy for little hands to pick chunks out of and eat. My son got this book two days ago and has already picked most of the sponge out and tried to eat it (he is 1 year old). By the time a kid is old enough to know not to pick it out and eat it they are probably to old for a ""my first words"" touch and feel book board book.If your baby tends to ignore stuff like that, or you don't mind pulling all of the sponge out and leaving it empty then this is a great book."
1,Nightmare,"When I got this item it was larger than I thought It was the size of a small video game but bulky. However, I was not going to complain because I got it for a great price. However, within 4 days it stop working, I could not see anything on the screen and I was without phone for 3days which is a nightmare because I have no home phone line. Like that old saying if you think it is to good to be true it is. Don't buy this phone!!!!"
1,don't bother.,"this thing is hard to use. it freezes constantly, and even resets itself out of the blue. oh yeah, it's as thick as a brick. was 2006 really that long ago?"
5,area rug 3'x5',"I do love this rug, it is so plush and tightly woven, the colors are very vibrant and rich. I have it at the front entry floor, which is a split entry and amazingly enough it does not show dust or dirt at all...I have to remind myself to vacuum it because it always looks so clean! The edges are nicely done with no loose or gapping threads and the pattern is very sharp and crisp. The price is right, totally affordable if or when it needs replacing. I had been shopping for a rug for several months so decided to try mail order with the knowledge that I would probably have to return it...and what a pain that is! I was pleasantly surprised and would reccommend this rug to anyone."
5,A MUST FOR BEGINNERS & EXPERIENCED QUILTERS,"Buy this book if you want clear, concise, illustrated information on everything you need to know to make a wonderful quilt. I refer to this book often, and have given it as a gift to new quilters. One of the best."
5,What a resource!,"I love this series from Rodale and have every one in my library. They do not contain patterns, just instructions with full-color step-by-step photographs. This book covers about any piecing method you might want to review, hand or machine. There are lots of great tips along the way . . . even if you are an experienced quilter, you will get some new ideas from this book."
3,Pet Allergies,"Very informative, but the material is quite dated and certainly should be time to update this book. If it was updated it would rate 5 stars."
3,Technical book,This is a very technical book for someone trying to solve allergies. I wish there were more example and solutions to try.
1,Out of date,The information contained within this book was extremely out of date with a strong emphasis on steroids. It is a shame there are not more current and useful books for pet owner out there on this widespread problem.
4,"Slim volume, helpful information","Veterinarian Alfred Plechner has treated many pets with allergies and nutritional deficiencies, and he makes a strong case against most commercial pet foods. I found his discussion of enzyme deficiency to be helpful.He blames many pet-health problems on improper breeding and commercial pet food. I would have liked to see a bit more information on the role of chemicals and pollution in pet disease, although he did devote a few pages to this topic and cautions against color enhancing chemicals, BHA, BHT, MSG, propylene glycol, and too much sodium.Every pet owner should make an effort to provide their animals with healthy food. Books like this can help them."
5,Great!,"I love these clamps, ive been working with reptiles for awhile and ive tried many different kinds of clamps and i think these work the best, they are simple and easy to use. it took about 1 1/2 weeks for me to receive them but i am very pleased"
5,Aquarium Tank Top Security Clips * small *,These small security clips are very strong and will keep you snake and/or your reptile secure in their cage.These clips are very hard to unlatch but other than with a small amount of adjusting they work great!I recommend these small security clips for the screen top for small Aquariums 10 and 20 gal.
3,Almost too strong,"These clips fit my 2OL tank very nicely. However, they are almost too strong. It is very difficult to remove these clips if you want to open the tank and get to your pet. I have to use easier to remove clips on one side of my tank to ensure i can gain access to my snake."
3,A comprehensive review of a semi-comprehensive hip-hop DVD,"Sony Music's ""Ruffhouse 10th Anniversary Special"" DVD is a semi-comprehensive exercise in the examination of one of the longer-lasting hip-hop record labels in the music business. Many fans will appreciate the full versions of videos by Cypress Hill (when they were still ground-breaking) and The Fugees among others; on the other hand, more underground hip-hop heads looking for attention to be paid to artists such as lesser-known groups like The Goats, Larry Larr, Cheeba, Tim Dog and the like will most likely be dissapointed with all the attention paid to artists with bigger (i.e. sales) success like Kris Kross. All in all, this DVD serves a decent addition to any hip-hop fan looking for a DVD hip-hop title but will only tide one over until better selections are offered up to the public."
3,"Good read, yet unrealistic","I use two words to describe Mindbend--BEACH BOOK. Although it's a pretty good book and a quick read, it's very unrealistic. Dr. Cook usually presents his moral controversies in a very realistic way. But this one seemed to stray far from the point. It's by no means a bad book and I recommend it but if you've never read a Cook book, start with something like Contagion, Chromosome six, or Acceptable Risk."
4,Great story!,"Yes I realize this story is far-fetched, but I enjoyed it anyway. The characters were interesting, the plot moves along swiftly and there's never a dull moment. My only disappointment with this book was that you're not told what ultimately happens to the men from Arolen. Other than that it's a great read."
4,Mindbend-A Real Mindbending Experience.,"Mindbend was really mindbending after all, like the title proclaims. The book is about a guy named Adam who discovers that the drug company taking care of his wife's pregnancy is part of a horrible conspiracy involving mind control. Naturally, he has to take action. Alone, of course. This was Cook's 5th book and was one of the ones that made him famous for his time. Over 20 years old, this book is still in print and read by millions."
3,Not my favorite...,"I LOVE Robin Cook's writings. This book though was by far my least favorite of his. I found it pretty predictable. Only a short way into the story, I could tell how it was going to end. I kept reading in hopes that some kind of plot twist would happen... but sadly, the story ended exactly like I thought it would."
3,Mindbend,"I think that Mindbend is a bit unbelievable, even from the beginning. Adam is unreasonably stubborn, considering any kind of help from Jennifer's parents interference. The mind-control plot is a bit obvious, and the evil pharmeceutical company is overblown. For example, doctors would not steadily prescribe a drug, particularly for pregnant woman, that was harmful and ineffective. Anyway, the FDA would be running tests on it and doing recalls if it was awful, not private medical journals. I think Mindbend is a good read if you're patient and willing to overlook holes in the plot and characters."
2,Not very good,"Robin Cook has written very good books. But he is not really consistent. A best selling author like Cook should be expected to control his writing better. But this novel is too obvious in its plot. After reading about fifty pages you can exactly imagine what will be next. And you can be pretty sure what kind of ending the story might have. Cook writes about a really burning problem of our time. But the plot is too improbable and implausible to cope with the seriousness of this problem. His afterword is better than the whole book. But the book is good when you are on a long flight, or perhaps when you are enjoying a lazy vacation. There is suspense after all."
5,Mindbend Review,Whoa! Best book I have read in a while. It kept my attention from beginning to end. It was thrilling and scary and makes me wonder where the medical and pharmaceutical industry is heading. I would recommend it.
4,"exciting, one of his best of the ones I've read.","I've read at least ten of cooks books. Including mortal fear and invasion.This was one of my favorites. It was very exciting, and kind of scary. Althogh his books are usually all the same (all about some medical conspiracy in an HMO)this one stood out above the rest."
3,readable,Quite a good book but not his best. The plot is predictable but Cook saves it by his style of writing.
1,"No card, no good.","Let's face it. No one really wants this book for the book itself, every collector wants it for the Egyptian God card that comes with it.Mine didn't come with a card. Even though I bought it ""New"" it was unwrapped and the card was removed.Obviously, I'm not pleased. Unless you can somehow find this new in a bookstore 6 years after the movie came out, I don't recommend buying this online."
3,Faithful Adaptation of a Mediocre Movie...,"Let's go by the numbers, shall we? What do you get in this book?1. Slifer the Sky Dragon, one of the three coveted ""God Cards."" Of course, you can't use this in a duel. So, it's basically eye candy.2. A faithful adaptation of movie. It's in full color and looks pretty.I just wish that the movie was really something more compelling. When I saw it in the theaters, I was amazed and aghast at how much dialogue was spent explaining why a certain card or combinations thereof spelled the other player's doom.I'd recommend it only for the younger Yu-Gi-Oh fans, as well as anyone who wants a God Card. Other than that, I'd recycle it."
4,Good Binocs,I did some research to find the best binocs in this price range. I am confident that I found them. They are great for sports or any general use.
5,the search ends,I looked all over for a particular song on this CD. Found the song and so much more.
4,child's cleaning set,"my granddaughter loves this set. my only reservation is, it being made in china, are there any toxins, lead, etc. in the plastics."
3,could be better,"Got this for my 2 year daughter. She like to clean and we thought this would be good. It has the mop, broom dustpan etc. The quality of the mop and broom can be easily improved to make it a great product. The bristles should be soft and the edges on them should not have sharp corners. Can hurt toddlers and your walls :)"
2,Way overpriced,"Bought this for my 3 children to share since they like trying to sweep with a big broom, mop, etc. For 20 bucks, this item is way overpriced since it's cheap plastic made in China junk. The kids don't even play with it,they would still rather use the adult brooms. Save your money."
3,Aesthetically pleasing but flimsy,"My toddler loves to help....I normally let him sweep with the regular broom but we recently began at home Montessori so I invested in these pint sized options.The set is very pleasing to the eye.The mop is EXTREMELY flimsy. My two year old prefers to struggle with the Real mop because this one is just a toy apparently and doesn't soak up anything.My son isn't very tall, so the heights are ok. Could be a little longer handles.The broom isn't stiff at all. If it were stiff it'd be a great broom. It's not bad though.The hand brush is the best of the three.The bucket and dustpan are perfectthe spray can is fake so you can't fill it with water so he doesn't care for it.Hope that helps!Good set, not great.Great for play only though, but not for really for Montessori."
1,Cleaning Set,I would not recommend this product because I bought this set for my two year old granddaughter. The broom and mop are too short for her to use. She has to get on her knees to play like she is sweeping or moping. I was disappointed when I saw the product.
3,Purchased as a gift,"The set is very realistic and is a small set just like the real stuff. If your child wants to clean, then the set is just what you are looking for, it will mop and clean."
2,Works great when it isn't broken due to normal use,"Overall the print drivers seem to work fine (we use a server driver) and the machine prints with the quality level and speed I expect. However we've had this for 14 months and printed 180,000 pages (about 13,000/month) This should be within reason given the 100,000 PPM duty cycle for the machine. A cheap plastic roller in the fuser feed system breaks about every 3-4 months. The parts are $250 plus the service call. Our service rep said this happens to all of the 6 systems he services with other customers. This destroys the total cost of ownership for the system and hurts our customer service when we have to switch over to printing on a multi-function fax printer (which is a lot slower)."
4,Charming Victorian fantasies,"I bought the book to own a copy of ""A Toy Princess,"" a truly wonderful fairy tale, and, I think, the best story in the book. The rest of the stories are lovely as well, just what you would like in a Victorian story. The language is splendid, the people are the stock fairy tale characters, and the stories tend to have a moral, but not one that weights the story down too much.My one criticism of the book is physical. Someone took an old copy and evidently scanned all the pages. So here and there a page is blurry or messed up in some other way. I wish the pages were all perfect, but I'm grateful to be able to possess a book otherwise out of print."
2,Hard to Follow!!,"This is not a ""user friendly"" exercise video. I have three primary complaints: 1. Denise Austin does not give sufficient instructions on the steps. She just moves from one to the other as if we are mind-readers. She may say something about the new step, but she does not say it before the step. In other words, insufficient cues are given for someone to follow along with this workout. 2. There are too many steps. This video would have been better if she had selected maybe one dozen steps or variations. I bet there are thirty different steps or variations. This is confusing, and doesn't really yield a better workout than fewer steps would accomplish. 3. Denise Austin is very enthusiastic, but her never-ending, ""cute"" comments detract from the workout. She needs to substitute clear and timely instructions for the constant chatter."
2,Lost in my living room,"First let me say that I got a good work-out, but mainly it was from laughing with my friend while trying to keep up/figure out what Denise Austin was doing! My friend and I have done a Leslie Sansone video and enjoyed that A LOT MORE than this! Denise does no instruction on what she is doing -- she assumes we all know the choreography! There is also a claim that the video requires only six feet of space -- she takes up a lot more than that. It does lend itself to much laughter if you are uncoordinated like myself! If you really concentrated and did this video a lot, you might get more out of it. The cool-down at the end is good -- we didn't try the ""superfit"" section at the very end."
3,"Good product, mediocre price","I bought these for a sleeping bag that had no straps of its own. They are sturdy and do the job well, but you might be able to find the same or similar product elsewhere for a considerably lower price. Shop around."
3,They work...,"They work, but recently picked up a similar set from REI with quick release fasteners on them...this is a much better idea."
5,Good straps,They work fine for keeping my backpack shelter kit rolled up all together.My advice though is to buy straps much longer than you need. This waythey can have more options for you. These work well for my purpose.
3,a little too comprehensive,"Yes, it has some great songs you won't find elsewhere. Unfortunately the 1200 songs contain a lot that you just...won't...use. I think HL padded the count with stuff from the 19th and early 20th century (whose copyrights are long-expired), plus kiddie songs and folk tunes that hardly anybody knows. The chords are pretty cliched, too."
1,WHY BOYS & GIRLS ARE DIFFERENT,"Nowhere did I see a note that this book is not a scientific explanation of the differences between boys and girls and the reasons for the differences. Be aware that this is a religious sidestepping of the subject, in which the child is told that a hetero married couple ""prays to God"" when they want a child.If you were looking for a more complete explanation, keep looking."
1,What a hype!,"A nice, if self-indulgent and hugely precious, read until the ending. What a waste of time! 400 pages, yuk. No more Jonathan Dee the Great American Writer for me."
2,Interesting but disappointing and unsatisfying,"I loved the premise of the book, the idea of creating serious art without using irony, but it really didn't feel like this book was ultimately about that. It was really more of this love story between a character I really liked (John) and a character I initially liked (Molly) but who became more thoughtless, unreasonable and selfish as the book wore on.I was very dissatisfied by the end. Nothing changed with most characters, which was infuriating after all the havoc they wreaked on other people's lives, and the one character I did like seemed to have lost virtually everything. I never could understand what in the world was wrong with the Howe family, particularly what would drive both kids to never speak with their family members again. I don't feel like I understood who anyone in that family really was. And I didn't understand what on earth that message gibberish interspersed at the end was. Worse, I didn't even care anymore."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this one. While I really didn't like The Lover of History, I loved The Liberty Campaign (also about advertising) and liked St. Famous. But Palladio is just not successful, for a number of reasons. For one, the female characters seem rather interchangable, which is a big pet peeve of mind. Another more basic issue, at least for me, is that the story just didn't seem plausible. It's difficult for me to believe that these ""revolutionary"" PR campaigns would've worked. Another reason that the novel failed for me was that Mal, the character who was supposed to be this fascinating enigma, was just a big yawn. Finally, I found the change in tense halfway through the novel distracting and fairly pointless. So a big Thumbs Down for this one. Read The Liberty Campaign instead"
5,mariosussie4,good product used like mention on the product arrived on time and I really enjoy having my figures on these stands.
2,Not worth the money>>>>>>>>>,"I purchase this game for my son last christmas, who was 4 at the time. I don't think it has been played with more than a couple times. I tried to play it tonight and now I wish I knew where the directions were. There is one game you move a target all around the sceen to find some dinasour bones, then you twist and turn the bones to fit into the dinasour puzzle, did not seem exciting. Then there is another game where you have to know if the dinasour is a meat eater or a plant eater?? I would not recommend this game."
1,MADE IN CHINA,"This product is made in China. It is falsely advertised in the product description as being made in Germany but it is not. These knives are made in China, and some of the knives are labeled as being made in China with German steel. The steak knives have no such label, alluding to the point that they are made with Chinese steel.These knives are made in China and it shows in the craftsmanship."
3,How shall I try to put this....,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first 'Bond Back In Action', and I really tried to like this. While it has it's high's (like the 'TLD' and 'GE' parts, as well as 'TSWLM' and 'FYEO'), it had it's terrible, crash and burn, lows, such as: what ever happened to 'LALD'?? What, did it suddenly get lost? And doing music from 'TMWTGG'? That was some of the corniest music (Chinese overtones? I know we're supposed to be in the Far East and all, but please spare me).One of the very first things I noticed when I got the CD: the packaging was very poor and just done very badly (like a trained monkey had put the thing together), and, in addition, the front cover of the case had a big 2-inch crack in it.Sadly put: this CD could've been better. Lots better."
3,Never say Never Again !,"I like his CD. But I love 1st vol. more. Because, 1) No ""Live and let die""and ""License to kill"" music is here. (I wish to hear ""Gun-Barrel""music of ""Live and let die"" and Sound Track CD of ""License to kill"" has bad editing!) 2) ""Bond 77""(or ""Car Chase"" music) isn't here. 3) ""Hercules Takes Off""is too Fast.(I love that cue!) 4) More musics of ""Golden eye"" should be here. (Especially ""Climax Chase on Antenna""must be!) 5) Most of all, why no ""Gun-Barrel""music ? Film version of ""Tank Drive Around ST. Petersburg""is welcome, though it isn't so nice cue for me. My best cue on this CD is ""Freefall""(Yes, Pre-title action cue of ""Moonraker""!)So , I gave only 3 stars to this CD. But I really wish to buy Vol.3 ! Please never say never again ! (And please more ""Gun-Barrel""music for fan!)"
5,The whole world in your hands,"My dad always bought me The World Almanac when I was a kid. No matter what the topic was, research for school assignments always found me first reaching for this volume for orientation. The information found in the Almanac lets you hold the whole world in your hands."
4,Colombian Music - Mexican Style,"""Volver"" is not the accordion music of the 40's & 50's. Sergio Cias plays both the keyboard & the button accordion on this album straining notes out of them unheard before. Javier Lopez sings storybook songs & leads the beat that Americans are learning to love to dance to from Mexico & Colombia - South America."
5,Excellent!,"This book is a good background guidebook to the martial arts. It has chapters on Bruce Lee, the martial arts in movies, and discusses karate, tae kwon do, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and others. ""The Ultimate Martial Arts Q&A Book"" is peppered with interesting facts and photos. For examples, photos of Elvis Presley's $500.00 karate gis are shown (in an era where $500.00 went really far). What this book will not do, however, is teach you techniques or katas, or how to win a fight. A good read for entertainment value."
3,"Not great, but probably no better alternative.","Chances are if you're considering buying this book it's because you've been assigned it as part of your A&P; program. The book is fine, has some good illustrations, and some nice clear passages explaining a wide range of topics.On the other hand, there are mistakes all through this book. My A&P; instructors led me to make changes at least twice in every chapter we studied, and the electricity section is particularly confusing. The authors apparently weren't able to decide whether to go with electron flow theory or to teach the (incorrect) conventional theory. They present the electron flow theory but proceed to repeatedly refer to conventional theory in their explanations. This leads to all kinds of confusion to a less-than-careful reader.In the end, the textbook is fine. Read your homework and ask questions in class on stuff you don't understand, and don't be surprised when you find out that Jeppesen was wrong."
5,Love This Video,"I got the DVD, and what I most loved were some of the feel techniques, like closing your eyes while putting or trying to put and not spill a wineglass. This instructor takes an intuitive, ""feel"" approach to golf. In an era where even players like Tiger are ""overstudying the game"", I feel this video gets you to connect with a golf feel on different shots. After all, it is a sport and we are not swing robots. This DVD is perhaps best for beginners and intermediates, but as a 6 index, I got a lot out of the drills as well.Highly recommend!Alex"
5,Great for all athletes!!!,"This is a must for the golfer in your family. Whether they are a beginner or expert, you can learn so much from Roberto. With Christmas near, it's a must for the golfer in your life!!!"
5,"A sophisticated, British version of Sex & the City and Desperate Housewives","I immensely like this sophisticated, British version of Sex & the City and Desperate Housewives. It's not as quickly paced as American TV shows. The pace is slower, the characters are deeper and darker and more credible, but just as likeable. I wished there were more shows like this.I also liked the lesbian storyline with the beautiful and sexy Anna Torv as a co star.An outview: Seasons 2 and 3 are unfortunately not as good, but still worth to watch.Highly recommended."
5,Mistresses Volume 1,"Mistresses is one of those shows that you can't help but love. It's a little bit soap, a little bit romance, and a little bit comedy. It follows four friends: Katie (Sarah Parish), Trudi (Sharon Small), Jessica (Shelley Conn), and Siobhan (Orla Brady) as they each in their own way, become a mistress -- albeit not always intentionally. Through it all, they remain the best of friends and are there for each other no matter what. What I love most about this DVD is that it includes both the first and second series of show, so you won't have to go out and buy them separately. All in all, I was very pleased with the Misresses Volume 1 DVD."
2,ok book,"It was the exact same thing as the tv series. They need to have different books than the show. It did stick to the show too ,so that was good."
2,False/Misleading advertising on size.,"I thought I was getting the gallon size. How about providing the number of fluid ounces or quarts or gallons. Upon closer reading after committing to the purchase I see that the size is ""Ha"". That certainly is not the standard abbreviation for any volume units in the U.S. of A. The mass of 1.4 ounces(not fluid ounces) does not make sense either. I am really peeved and do not recomend buying from this company called ""Hardware World, LLC"" selling on Amazon."
1,Not Impressed,"I was really hoping to like this after seeing such great reviews. After looking at a few of the reviews I noticed a theme of outdated. I agree, it may have been shocking years ago but now it's lost any edge. I also thought the book was long winded and found myself skipping through various paragraphs at the end just to finish. The beginning kept my interest up until the ""shocking"" revelation. After that it went down hill, fast. The clean-up was way too easy and lasted way to long; no suspense. I also have a real hard time believing that the main character could go down the path he chose."
2,Hasn't aged well,"On the positive side this book is fairly well written and tries to be a psychological thriller. On the negative side, that's all to be said on the positive side. The plot creaks, the pace is slow, the characterisation is flat, and the events chronicled are stale. If your sole reading matter to date has been Alice in Wonderland, Wind in the Willows, and Tom Brown's Schooldays then you may be shocked by Finishing Touches. But if you have even glanced at a newspaper or magazine in the last 30 years than nothing in here is likely to surprise you except perhaps for the sheer banality of it all.Some reviewers regard this as an erotic thriller but in my opinion it neither thrills nor is erotic in any way. It's just dull stuff."
4,Great Thriller But Uneven Ending,"This book had me flipping pages as fast as I could read them. That is, until the last few chapters. The setup was so amazing, I knew the momentum couldn't last. The last quarter of the book felt rushed and not in character with the first 3/4. However, the characters, atmosphere, culture, and story was incredibly engrossing. It reminded me of some of Evan Hunter's (Ed McBain) books -- of a dangerous and mysteriously erotic nature. The added bonus of the novella, ""Father Panic's Opera Macabre"" was also extremely strong but had the same problem at the end. Still, I would definitely recommend reading it."
5,If Elvis was a Vampire he would rock to this beat,"Wow! This CD knocked me on my (...) right from the first song. ""Rockabilly Vampire"" cam blasting from the speakers and pumped me. If you dig The Rev, Social D and The Supersuckers you're gonna like this baby. Another couple of favorites are ""Rock n' Roll Zombie"" and ""'51 Chevy"". Hot Rod Rockabilly that makes me want a tattoo!"
2,take other set,"bought today for my kid (just wanted something and within three choices in local town center for price < $30 took this set. total disaster:1) white are not white but bad brown (i think the idea was to style them like wood white but they completely miss the color and not visibility on board is bad)2) no numbers and letters on board3) quality of board is very low - after you open it fully in join place black and white boxes will not match for about 1-2 mm4) strange holding casemy suggestion - skip it and go with other option, this one is really poor quality"
4,nice item,looks very nice hanging in the trees. Haven't had any birds eat from it yet. Will transfer it to a higher location and see if that helps.
1,TURTLE WAX ULTRA WET IS AN ULTRA RIPOFF,This product makes tires black but does not shine AT ALL! Save your money for a product that does what it promises. The older Turtle Wax Wet & Black used to be great but they changed that also to no longer work well!!
4,"Good sound, a few software quirks","Overall I've been happy with the sound from this unit in my relatively small living room.However, I have experienced several of the software quirks mentioned by other readers. When playing DVDs, the unit will periodically lock up, requiring a hard reset to function again. The system also occasionally gets into a state where the sound has a deteriorated ""tinny"" quality -- this also goes away with a power cycle of the unit. Defects like this are a bit disappointing from a relatively mature (second edition) product from a name like Bose.One tip is that while the system ships with relatively short custom cords for connecting the unit to subwoofer and the subwoofer to the speakers, longer versions of both cables can be ordered directly from Bose for relatively nominal cost (one was free and one was less than $50 if I recall)."
1,Refurbished or,"Recieved with some parts missing. Got the missing parts next day, that was excellent service. The remote did not work or get a picture. They replaced the remote and media center but it did not work. Sent it back and waiting for a refund.Bought one at BestBuy and it works fine."
3,"Ify on the unit, but great service","I bought this item a couple of years ago and just as soon as the warranty was over, it started acting up. It would freeze up on us constantly, which was very irratating during a movie! I couldn't find a place that would fix it locally, and I was reluctant to ship it to Bose for repairs... I'm glad I did! Their customer service was great, they made it easy to ship, and I got it back in about a week!So, the unit I give 3 stars but the customer service I give 5 stars."
1,Bose Home Theater,"For the people who are about to buy this product; Bose has a big name is world renound, but to me the base of the System is very poor. You could to barely hear the base of music. We had an onkyo system that cost us about $200 and the base of that is more satisfiying. The system in a Honda car is more satisfiying than this so called ""Great System."" So next time when you are thinking to by Bose, Think before you waste your money on this product."
1,Bose Should Recall Every One Of These,"What junk!!! Mine can only be used as a radio. Even CD's won't play on it - they freeze and I get a message ""unsupported format."" I bought it to replace an excellent Bose system that I lost (along with my house) in Hurricane Katrina and because of all the other problems we had to contend with let this slide. Now I see that most everyone has the same bad experience with this piece of junk."
1,"Won't play DVDs, audio quality far less than expected","This system developed a problem where it suddenly ""Can't Read Disc"" in the middle of movie. The only way to clear the problem is to restart the system. It happens with any DVD...even multiple brand new ones...at any momment during DVD play. It is ssociated with a sudden increase in disc drive noise...presumably because it is ""hunting"". Based on similar comments by others about the Bose 321 system on this web site, this appears to be a significant and relatively frequent problem...maybe even a design flaw.Audio quality was disappointing too.Definitely would NOT recommend this product...suggest you keep looking!!!!!"
1,Absolute Junk!! Just a name brand riding a big marketing push!! Save Your Money!!!,This system is absolute and positively JUNK!! Do not buy this product. I cannot even believe the hype that this product gets. Will never buy another BOSE product again!! Hope this helps.
1,unhappy,"I bought mine for my Husband.We have all the same problem as all of you do and most of all the sound is not good .and they don't give you your money back if you purchase threw Bose ,witch I did that's alot of money down the drain .They don't care .All I got was return it for repair and I haVe to paid for that also ."
3,"Speakers Good, DVD player JUNK","I'm giving this product 3 stars because I use it primarily as a sound system, I have audio channeling into the auxillary ports for cable and PS3. If you are planning to use this as a DVD player BE WARNED that it SUCKS. It is virtually useless as a DVD player because it will continually freeze during playback and give you error messages that it cannot read the discs. It has been doing that since I bought the thing, but luckily I just use the Blu Ray on my PS3 and run the sound through the Bose system, and for that purpose it works beautifully. Just make sure you have a separate DVD player to run through the AUX port on this sound system, and you will be good."
1,Broke in under 24 hours,I watched 1 DVD on this before the on-unit display quit working. It now just shows random pixels that blink in odd patterns. It also doesn't turn off anymore either. (at least not by the button...it still randomly shuts off on it's own when it's done blinking pixels)
1,same as rest - JUNK,"Similar story to others, only mine at least played DVDs for 18 months b4 the dreaded Format Unsupported start showing up. Now all I have is an expensive 3 speaker system that sounds good at times but at other times you can't hear voices. It was overpriced to start with but I bought into the Bose name thinking it would be quality. What a joke. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, anything else would be either cheaper or more reliable or both!"
1,BOSE - Never again!,"Expensive and really not worth it! When I bought it, I sometimes got the message 'unsupported format'. They told me it was my mistake, that I did not put in the CDs or DVDs correctly. Now, the message is the same, and it won't play any CD or DVD at all and now they say I must pay the repair! Really great ):"
2,Doesn't work with NEW PS2 (progressive scan model),"Had this and it worked fine with my old PS2. I just bought a new PS2 with the progressive scan, built-in IR receiver, and quieter operation. And guess what? It does not work with it. And Of course Sony does not offer an extension cable. Just be aware. I gave the cable away with my old system."
1,It's R-Rated!,"Listen to the previous reviewers, at first when this title was available for pre-order, I was beside myself with excitment and immediately placed my order without batting an eyelid. However, upon closer inspection, it's rated R! Not the uncut NC-17 version. I cancelled my order immediately!Save your money here and head on down to Amazon UK to get the original uncut edition, even though it's more expensive. Around 14 pounds."
1,No thanks Sony!,"In order to please the Blockbusters and Wal-Marts of the nation, Sony has decided (in their infinite wisdom) to only release an EDITED version of this film on home video. I really thought that we were past this type of censorship, but apparently not.The film, which was released in theaters NC-17, is now trimmed by about three minutes and re-rated R. This is a shame because I personally felt that the NC-17 was unjustified. I have seen far more graphic footage in films that got away with an R.If you want to support censorship of a genuine piece of art, go ahead and buy this dvd. Otherwise, invest in a region-free player and import the uncut version from the UK. Being region-free is the only way to be!"
1,Amazing movie,The movie is amazing. The one star is because this is the R-rated version! Don't get it! The NC-17 version released in theaters is much rawer.John
2,SANITIZED FOR YOUR PROTECTION...,"I have literally looked everywhere to find the ORIGINAL uncut cinematic version of Trocchi's masterpiece, but apparently it is not fit for American eyes-- To all those at Amazon; let me know when the original British version is deemed ""acceptable"" enough to sell amidst all of the violent, meaningless drivel we are currently bombarded with. I will be more than eager to order THAT version... How demeaning..."
4,Good Architectural template,"If you are doing Architectural drafting of any kind, well first off, really? You need to get CAD, but beside that, it has many of the templates needed for basic architectural drafting. My one gripe is that this thing is rather large. I was hoping for a smaller (say 4x6) size so I can use it as a general straight edge, but it is too big for that making it difficult to use as a straightedge. I don't recall seeing the dimensions when I purchased, but it is a gaudy 6-1/2"" x 9-1/2""."
1,total rip off,u can get this from any indian store for 1.30 or 1 dollar.they should definately reduce the price. but the spice mix is really nice except for the PRICE
3,Beautiful CZ earring at reasonable price,I liked the earrings for the look of the CZ and representing the picture. However the back is TEENY TINY and very difficult to use. I'd prefer spending more money and getting a back like seen in photos.
5,"Excellent, Beautiful, Revealing","Please, does anyone know if and when this will be released on DVD for USA format? I have been waiting, and my VHS copy has been borrowed away by friends.This is a film to be revisited time and again."
5,She's Just a Fantastic Singer,"I have 14 CDs by Doris Day, the equivalent of 25 records. I've heard her in person, and she has one of the purest voices I've ever heard. There's no electronic gimmickry to make her sound that good, no matter the song.She has an amazing range, and her interpretation of songs is impeccable. I realize that music is subjective, and I'm so old that I think most of what I hear outside of country (omg,did I say that?) is screaming, but if Doris Day isn't the best, she's certainly in the league with the greatest from the 40s, 50s, and 60s.THIS album takes the place of two of her records that I had, ""Day by Day"" and ""Day by Night."" It has the best overall collection and really shows off her natural talent.And unlike other singers of her era, she knew when to quit. Her voice was even better in the 70s than in the 40s."
1,Doris Day,We bought this cd for a friend and went to his house to listen to the cd. To our dismay track 17 has a bad scratch on the cd and that was a real disappointment. You don't know how embarrassed we were. We won't be buying cd's from Amazon any longer.Sandra Gassaway
1,this thing is worthless,"This thing is worthless, unless you need a doily for your wii remote, while you are not using it. I stupidly sent positive feedback for this product before I tried it. It looked so cool I couldn't wait to try it on cross links--DOESN""T WORK!! and there is no place to stow all of the wire between the wii controller, and the nun-chuck. I will use it for an ashtray if I start smoking again."
1,Useless Accessory,"I bought this controller cradle for use in Call of Duty 3 and Resident Evil. With the control set up of each game, this item has no purpose. You can't possibly use the controllers in this cradle and play either of these games."
2,Poor Durability,"My dog doesn't like being in a kennel while in the car, so I bought this harness for her safety. When I first received the product my dog had no trouble putting it on; it fit okay and it didn't seem to bother her. I only use it while in the car with her (which is not very often) but one of the straps has already begun to tear. It's already ripped about halfway and I don't expect that it would last much longer. I am really disappointed because I use it sparingly, and don't even remember using it more than 6 times or so. Anyway, I've contacted the company to see if their warranty covers the damage and will update with their response.Update:Took a while, but I finally got a new one after a little over a month."
2,Hate,"My greyhound hates this thing. He wears the Gentle Leader Easy Walk harness with no problems, so I guess this one just doesn't fit his deep chest properly. I got a size large, which turned out to be the right size for him (he's 31"" around the chest), but he's oddly proportioned.It seems to be made well, though, especially for the price."
4,good product,"Boomer loves short car trips, but does tend to roam around the car. When I needed to travel several hours for Thanksgiving, and decided to take him instead of leaving him at a kennel, I wasn't sure how well he would travel. I also did not think it would be a good idea, safety-wise, for him to be unrestrained while traveling on the interstate at higher speeds than around-town travel.This harness did not seem to cause him any discomfort. He always happily hops in the car, and did not fight having the harness put on him, and did not try escape after being harnessed and attached to the seatbelt. He could sit up, or lie down, but did not seem distressed about not being able to hop into the unoccupied front seat.And while most car trips do not involve a crash, I felt better about him being restrained than loose in the car. I am totally satisfied with this product. I don't take many trips where I'll need it, but was worth the price just for this one trip, and glad to have it for future use."
4,Engaging,"An engaging tale of a girl who accepts life as it is, helping those around her to stop fretting and worrying. Suitable for 5-7."
5,good intro book for radar engineering,"This third edition is much more readable than the second edition. A vast improvement in the breadth of topics, and also the depth of topics over the second edition. A good introduction to radars and how they work. For the die-hard technical person, however, the Radar Handbook (also by Skolnik) is still king. This book does not get into the detail of the Radar Handbook. However, someone just learning radar would find the extreme detail of the Radar Handbook too confusing. This book is a good starting place. Even if you own the second edition, you might want to upgrade to this one - the format and topics have improved that much."
3,"Good intro book, lacks some technical detail","I found this book to be lacking in specific technical details, but it gave wonderful overview of pretty much all of the areas in which radar systems are used, as well as a pretty comprehensive listing of all of the various radar technologies. Good for a first class, but more advanced books will be required for any real work in radar."
4,A thorough but somewhat dated book,"This book is one of the best introduction to Radar can be found in the market. I get the 2002 third edition. It is a good book for those who are new to the subject. However, it maybe somewhat dated and not that sufficient for those who want to do further research in particular radar area."
1,Falso advertisement,The picture shows you a pair of shocks and I only received one. It was very important and I had to waste time to ship it back and find somewhere else to purchase a pair of shocks. Why sell seperate shocks for around thirty bucks but this one is seventy just for one? Well Bad call on this one.
2,His brother's is better.,"I was really disappointed with this effort. Very bland, lazy works. Anyone these days could spend a few days sitting at their computer punching this auto-mated music out on their own. Sure it has certain Hartnoll-y sounds, but anyone could've imitated this stuff with knowledge of Hartnolls' works from the Orbital days.It could be said that the brothers have mellowed, since both their efforts now seem to be going towards the (gasp!) ""Easy Listening"" realm.......... sigh.Don't waste your money. Listen to the samples and decide for yourself, however."
1,???????????????????,"I CANNOT SEE THE TRACKS IT CONTAINS. IF U CAN PLEASE LIST THEM, I WILL BE VERY THANKFUL.I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM, THAT I CAN KNOW WHAT I AM ORDERING. THANK YOU"
1,A Waste of Money,"I purchased this book in an effort to educate myself about private practice and the legal pitfalls. I am not sure what M.D. helped write this book, but I am appalled. The presentation and language used, in addition to the numerous typographical errors made the text seem extremely juvenile. Many of the suggestions are completely unrealistic. I was offended as a medical professional and an english major at the frivolity of this book. Do not waste your money or time."
1,Useless,"This book has some useful concepts but most of it pretty much useless. ""If they can't find you, they can't sue you"" ""open accounts in fictious name, movie stars do it""I would not waste time or money with this book. There are other asset protection books written by reputable lawyers."
5,No physician should dare be without it,"Finally, an effective response to the malpractice lawsuit crisis that's damaging the profession. Extremely readable and is the definitive guide to asset protection.Very user-friendly forms, excellent resources and some ingenious tools for the medical profession. Totally essential reading."
1,JUNK,THE ONLY POWERFUL BURST THE DRAIN BUSTERGIVES IS FROM THE HOLE IN YOUR POCKETS.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. IT DOESN'T WORK!!
1,Buster it is not,This drain buster did not work as promised. I recently had a clogged bathtub and used this product for an hour with drain-o. Ended up having to call a plumber. A waste of money in my book!
1,Repetitive and boring.,"Predictable corrido fare--polkas and waltzes with lyrics about smugglers, drug barons and the like. Slogging through these 14 similar-sounding songs is a chore. Only useful as proof of how low musicians and record companies will stoop for a quick buck."
4,Works well,"Put the new downpour shower head where it needs to be, overhead. Finish matches a brushed nickel finish from another manufacturer so all told I am happy. I was quoted $300 for a similar Moen product by a local retailer, so a good deal overall."
4,"Good Quality Product, but at a High Price",This product is well made. And I was able to install it without any tools. But it is VERY expensive. That's why I only gave it a 4-star rating.
3,Amusing - yes. Educational - not really.,"Not too bad as far as coffee table books go. All the articles are short - a few hundred words - and there are plenty of B/W pictures to break the text up. This is a book I'd be happy my teenage daughter reading to get her interested in thinking outside the 'norm' of historical research but she wouldn't learn much from it (this book).A nice, light, amusing read that isn't going to offend anyone and might just entertain or inspire along the way."
2,Tries too hard,"The idea for this book is wonderful and the research exhausting. However, Ms. Leon tries so intensly to be clever that it is terribly annoying. Examples: ""The case spread faster than Lyme disease at a tick convention."" Or ""Mother Eulaia might have been called on to apply a little spiritual soft soap of her own-some extra innings at the cathedral, praying to her namesake."" Or ""Born into a Jewish family so tight with Catholic bigwigs."" Every page has to have one or more of her display of forced cotemporary pseudo wit that shocks the reader out of his/her Renaissance mood. It is a shame."
1,Not informative or witty,"I have to agree with two other reviewers, the book is not witty and is most annoying. The author tries very hard to be playful, any maybe her friends find her amusing, but her poor attempts at humor detracts from what could really have been clever and informational. This truly is bathroom reading of the worst kind. I am all for sassy and irreverent, but her writing is just plain poor. Keep a pencil and paper at hand so you can go someplace else to learn about these most possibly interesting women. Come up with your own pithy comments, they can't possibly be worse than hers! Try Infamous Women by Bellerophon Books instead."
4,Fun Book,"This is a fun book that tells you a little bit about women from all walks of life during the renaissance. From the pope's cousin that poisons people, to the mistresses of kings. This book was cute and witty. It has black and white sketches. This is not a good reference book, but it lets you know about women that you've never heard of. She included the smallest incidents, such as the woman who sold bad meat from her cart to big incidents, such as the young girl who organized her family to stab her father to death (the lout deserved it). It uncovers correption in every court from the Vaticin to Denmark. This book highlights martyrs, wonderful mothers, artists, and even female blacksmiths. This is great book, and you would be a fool to not read it at least once. A great gift book or coffee table book. The only down side is that sometimes it is difficult to tell if the author is stating a fact or making a joke...such is the torcher of funny people."
2,come back later,"This book was like what hors d'oeuvre are to a full meal. Now I want to read a real, complete biography of these interesting women. The book is mostly a lot of her 'witty' one-liners, and not too much information about the subjects. When the subject matter is much more interesting than the author, the author should step back and let the subject matter tell its own story. I think she must be like a smart-aleck 14 year old boy. You know they're smart and will grow up to be successful, but they're so annoying to be around now."
5,short stories),"Really great short stories about people in NYC. My brother lives in NYC and these stories are vivid examples of his tales, set in a great literary style. Relaxing to read before bed."
1,Save your money,This book is lacking severely. It reads like a research paper a student submitted to undergrad criminal justice class. Based on my 22 years as an officer this book is far from a good peer-reviewed or scholarly book. Save your money.
5,Excellent Book!,"This book is a must-have for anyone involved with the police use of force. In my experience as an officer and academy trainer, this book is easy on the eyes and relates specifically to contemporary issues in policy, training, and management of force issues. I would recommend it fully!"
5,Great all around shoes,I haved owned a pair of these for about 10 years very durable> I first bought these for fashion and then they turned into work boots. Even though they are steel toe the are very comfortable for just casual fashion or if you know your going to be on your feet all day these are great to. Your feet will thank you.
3,no me carga el 100 % de la pila,"la pila solo se carga a un 50 % cuando uso el transformador, pero cuando lo conecto al pc y el trandformador de forma simultanea si se carga el 100% de la pila"
5,The best software...if you're 8-13 years old,"This software is great... but I agree the age range is off... WAY off. But I am in the 8-13 year old group so I find it very fun. Some of the games are battleship, mazes, pinball and the game where you bounce the ball on the stick and you move it back and forth to catch the ball when it falls.Overall, I liked it allot.If you have a smart kid that does not get fresturated easily by hard-to-move pieces when you're trying to move something.(...)"
5,Very Good Documentary About The Bismarck,"This isn't the 1960 movie 'Sink The Bismarck'. This is a very good documentary about the sinking of the Bismarck, told from both sides. Veterans of the battle tell their stories about what happened, including one of the survivors of the HMS Hood. All the events of The Great Sea Chase (as the whole event is known as) are covered in detail. Highly reccommended to anyone with interest to this event, or Naval warfare in general, should buy this."
1,Not what you think it is!,Although this documentary may be very good...it is NOT a colorized version of the original Sink the Bismarck movie! We bought it as a gift for someone who had asked for the movie and were VERY disappointed!
3,OK,The Bernini Bust may be my least favorite of the Argyll mystery series. Being in America took all of the charm out of the book for this American. Still a solid book and I did enjoy it; it just isn't at the level of most others in this series.
1,NOT as advertised!,This is advertised as 10bs - the container we received was only 8lbs. There is also ONLY 14.5 servings in this container - very expensive!!!!Would NOT recommend this.
5,si se acabo el amor,This is just one of many best cd's Intocable has. There music is excellent not only to listen to but definitely dance to. They have an excellent show and dance. I miss Pepe...but I keep his memory close by with his sister. Miss U Mars....
1,Tactical Advertisement,I was hoping for a good training video for our paintball teams(DOGS OF WAR) young players. However I got a long....long advertisement of several paintball locations. Including shops and fields. And more speedball than scenario. There is two small segment pertaining to scenario or tactical paintball. Very disappointing.I do not recommend this DVD to anyone seriously looking for a training film.GrampsDOGS OF WAR
3,Different style of shoe,I like the shoes. Purchased the shoes in a s. 9 and my heel was hanging off. I then purchased the shoes in a s. 10 and they were too large - the top and size did not touch my feet. I was unable to wear the shoes.
5,Cute flat,This flat is very comfortable and the leather is rugged looking but not ugly. It could be gold or bronze or metallic...giving more options for accessories.
2,Poor Qualilty,I purchased this item based on past experience with Delkin products. This product falls far short of the quality that I have come to expect. The design is poor. The rubber eye cup and the LCD cover are not attached to the main body. They slip into tabbed cut out slots. On 2 occasions the LCD cover has fallen off while I was carrying the camera around my neck. The rubber eye cup has fallen off 3 times. I would highly recommend gluing these 2 parts so that they are permanently attached. I was out shooting today. When I stopped for lunch I discovered both the eye cup and LCD cover were missing. This time for good.
1,Delkin Devices LCD COVER PRO SNAP FUJI S3 ( DFS3-P ),The is a poorly designed accessory. I bought the Delkin Devices LCD COVER PRO SNAP FUJI S3 ( DFS3-P ) and it constantly fell of the camera. I even applied a small amount of glue on the eye cup and it still fell out. I will not buy it again and do not recommend this product. It is a piece of junk.
3,As Advertised...almost,"The product worked, but the roller wasn't quite as smooth and heavy as the pro models used at casinos. Functional and a good deal for the price."
4,6-Deck Card Shoe by Trademark,"Cosmetically identical to professional shoes, and nearly as hefty, this 6-deck card shoe is ideal for in-home Blackjack games with friends.It offers the convenience of using multiple decks with the ease of a single deck.Used in combination with a 6-deck automatic card shuffler, this shoe keeps the time and focus where it best belongs... on the play!"
3,OK but not great,"There are many different ""brands"" of this same type of shoe and this is one of the lowest price. Based on my research I would say almost all of these are made by the same company in China. There is no felt on the bottom to prevent sliding and contrary to description all of the corners and sides are NOT rounded. There are certainly some rough edges. But it does seem to be well put together hence not less than three stars. The weighted card dispenser seems sturdy. For the price this is fine, but I would have been very disappointed had I paid more."
3,It works,"The shoe holds and dispenses cards as advertised. It does slip around, even on felt. Part of the reason for that is getting the cards out; it takes some pressure to get a grip on the top card. Since there's an angle to the card, pushing down on the card also pushes back on the shoe. A rubber finger pad helps."
4,Works well,"This is pretty simple and works well. It looks exactly as nice as in the picture: just a bunch of plastic, but it's sturdy and does the job well."
1,Violation of Trade Mark Registered in Germany and United States of America by Barbara Gauss,"All Day I Dream About Sport : The Story of the Adidas Brand (Great Brand Stories series)by Conrad BrunnerDear Sirs,The Title of the book is violating my rights as a Trademark Owner in Germany and pending in the United States of America.I recommand to draw back the above mentioned publication.Yours sincerelyBarbara Gauss"
3,A Shame!,"I was very excited to finally get some official live footage of the band on DVD. The excitement quickly wore off though...Firstly, the mix is poor (Mick's guitar doesnt make an entrance for about 10 mins). Secondly, Neil sings one in every three of the words in most of the tracks. ""Jimmy....second hand hood.....deals....Hollywood....""etc.The biggest shame though is the censorship of some very fine .... throughout the show. Overall, buy this only if you are a hardcore Crue fan wanting to document their career."
4,What a great show,It was great. All of them done a great job. It would have been 5* if Tommy was still with them. But it is still a pure Rock n Roll kick ass show. Buy it you'll love it.
2,What happened to the words to the songs Vince?,"Vince doesn't remember or sing half of the words to the songs on this DVD! I was very disappointed - being a long time Crue fan, I was expecting a great show. The music was ok, I wasn't bummed about that - even if Tommy Lee isn't the drummer on the DVD. I was only bummed that Vince forgot the words."
1,Did anyone else really watch this DVD?!?,"I dont know what all the other reviewers were watching, but what I saw was a (badly) aging band, fronted by a lead singer that has let himself go a long time ago. To all of the 'true' Crue fans, did you notice that Vince was out of breath, missing every second word because he was too tired to sing them all, and this was during the first song. I was expecting a band that could still rock the roof off the place, and the only one I was impressed with was Samantha. I don't know why all the other reviewers were so put off by her. The rest of the band have showed years ago that their own egos and personal problems were more important than the fans who want to see them all together. I had high hopes for a hard-rocking, loud, energetic concert experience. Instead, what I found was a good argument that some of the truly great bands should quit while they are still ahead. If anyone wants to buy this DVD, I will give you agood price on mine!"
2,What's the use,"Doesn't have the original line-up; so why bother? If Tommy, Nikki, Mick and Vince aren't playing then it's not The Crue."
2,No refund!?,"I got kinda pissed when the store I bought this from said no flippin' refund. I bought this one as a chance to see how it is. Truthfully if you're into a more country kinda metal then go ahead. As for me, I'm a guitar freak and didn't like it. The first time I watched it I was like what the heck it this!? It's not as lively as I thought it'd be. Pretty much boring. And yes, I do have a mind for music and this one seems like they should lose the singer. He's got a voice but it doesn't match. Take your chances if you want. But to the metalheads out there who look at this, turn away and get something better."
2,Disappointing - Die Hard Crue Fans Don't Bother,"While I was thrilled to get a decent DVD recording of a live Crue show, I really wish it wasn't this one.First things first - I own the entire catalog and spent time playing in a Crue cover band. I have seen Crue five times including the surprise opener for Ozzie back before they were popular. I am a fan.First warning flag - a Crue show filmed in Salt Lake City. What's wrong with this picture??Second - this was probably their worst tour. The Generation Swine tour was outrageous, filthy and occasionally violent. Classic Crue and probably would have offended some people. That's what I would expect from Motley. Not the New Tattoo concert.Too bad, cause Crue was a hell of a show back in the day. Now they are relegated to the other 80's has beens with just a few original members (2) and none of their original edge."
5,This DVD Rocks!,"I had a rather low expectation of this DVD based on some of the reviews I read, but it was awesome. Great quality picture and sound, great performance. Samantha tears up the drums and is just incredible. I'm not sure why other people are knocking her. She Rocks! Any Crue fan should enjoy this DVD."
2,This is not the real Crue.....,"Frankly, do not buy this product. Get COS live. That is a real Motley show. I watched Lewd, Crued and Tattooed on PPV when it came out and it just did not come across as a real Motley show. There is no Tommy Lee and New Tattoo was not received very well. Carnival of Sins live is the real deal and the best out there."
1,Horrible,No Tommy lee and Vince cannot sing.Not that he ever could but he flinches at the notes and goes through the motions.Definitely a caricature of themselves.See it free on direct tv JUNE 2003 so you will no not to buy it!!
3,Not the way you remembered them...,"While it was interesting to see and hear the partial Crue with Samantha Maloney as their temporary drummer, they're just not, nor will they ever be the same without Tommy. Don't get me wrong, they didn't sound that bad, and Samantha is a very good drummer and more than holds her own, but something is just not right. Vince has gotten fat, I thought that he used to have a neck, not anymore. Sixx has also beefed up but still looks good. The one constant that hasn't changed is Mick, he's still one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time! However, even with that, they still don't seem quite right, like maybe they've lost the edge. If you're a diehard Crue fan you'll want this added to your collection, but don't plan on being knocked off your feet or anything.Salt Lake City? That still puzzles me, why not L.A., or New York City, surely they'd still sell out at those places, wouldn't they??"
4,Motley Crue Rocks Salt Lake,"What can I say other than what the Crue says best, with this DVD you can Kickstart Your Heart. This Concert, part of the Maximum Rock Tour from 2000 rocks from start to finish. The DVD which features 15 Crue Hits blasts in Dolby Digital 5.1 giving you the feel of being in the arena. The DVD is presented in an Anamorphic 16:9 Widescreen Format and looks sharp and detailed. The DVD utilizes good use of the Dolby Digital Format. The colors are crisp and overall the DVD is fantastic. Whether you are a Crue Fan or not, this DVD is an excellent piece of music history. The Disc has a lot of features including: a documentary of the making of the CD ""New Tattoo"", the ""Hell On High Heels"" Music Video, the first song ever recorded by the Crue and many other features. Well done... A hughlight for me is the cover of ""White Punks On Dope"" and the fierce and solid drumming skills of Samantha Maloney who filled in for Randy during his illness. A piece of Crue History at it's finest."
3,Not What I Expected,Motley Crue was one of my favorite bands out there. I went out and saw this DVD in stores and I read the back of it to check out the song list. All there greatest hits were on it. So I bought it and took it home and watched it... Tommy Lee isn't even the drummer. I was very disappointed when I found this out. Vince Neil's voice isn't even up to date. You can barely hear the guitar over the screaming fans... this DVD could have been a lot better if they worked on it a little more... I give it 3 stars because the music is there and I'm such a fan of Nikki
5,This is an excellent product,After surgery I used this Duro-Med protector everyday (in the shower) covering a full leg cast for 4 weeks. Then over a leg brace for 12 weeks. Its endurance and functionality was nothing less than remarkable.
3,Why Didn't The Label Push This ?,"Out Of Control is not bad, and has some radio friendly material (for the era it was released in).Such a shame this went practically unnoticed during one of Kiss' darker periods popularity wise(In the US only).Story has it that he didn't even do any live gigs to promote it and the one concert booked for a high school auditorium was cancelled due to lack of ticket sales. Peter Criss had solo Top 40 potential. His ""You Better Run"" could have beat Pat Benatar's if the public had been given the opportunity to hear it. This is the better of his post Kiss solo LP's.Although known for his gruff balladry,he's more of a rocker than people give him credit for."
1,Too Big,"I would have loved these shakers, but they were much bigger than I thought they would be - more suitable to a lumber camp than a normal dining room table. Corelle is just not very good in the accessories department."
1,Blazing Across the Pecos.,"The good news first, dvd quality is excellent throughout, both picture and sound. This Durango Kid feature is only 54 minutes but seems twice as long. Story is written around lots of stock footage and makes little sense. The lack lustre supporting cast just go through the motions, while Smiley Burnette is simply awful, and Charles Starrett looks bored. Jock Mahoney has a short scene as well as doing his usual excellent stunt work. At $17.95 it is very over priced. There are many far superior Starrett westerns let's hope that Columbia makes a better choice next time. How about two westerns to a disc."
1,Poor Quality,Do not waste your money on this Blu-ray. The picture quality is poor and even on my HD TV's brightest setting everything is dark. Sound is just as bad as the picture quality. The film crew spent too much time in the local markets and not enought time on the scenery.
5,Relaxing and gorgeous!,"There's nothing like popping in one of these gorgeous ""scenic walks"" and just letting the lethe wash over your brain (without actually, you know, having to go to China and stuff). I love to put on one of these gorgeous walks at the end of a long day. You learn about the people. You learn about the local environments. But you don't FEEL like you're learning because it's all so gorgeous. (This ain't school.) Seriously, it's just awesome. If you need to take your mind off things and relax, this scenic walks series works better than a stiff drink."
1,A stupid and useless book,"If you want to learn about various kinds of guns, various cartridges, gun technology and the technical details, firing mechanisms, don't buy this book. If you want the gun book that treats you like an idiot and tells you you shouldn't be pointing loaded gun at people around you, you should buy a gun from a reputable dealer and similar nonsense, this is the book for you. In addition, this book is heavy on endorsing specific gun manufacturers, like ""I am extremely loyal to S&W, their products are top notch of quality"" and similar. On a scale from 0 to 10, technical - zero, gun handling - zero, pseudo-safety nonsense - ten, manufacturer info - 5."
2,Very Basic,"I suppose it lives up to its title but, even for a novice like me, I found better information by just searching the internet."
3,Veggie Tales has no competition,"Big Idea, the makers of Veggie Tales, came out with 3-2-1 Penguins before the movie Madagascar came out. The movie is very nice, my 2 children like it. The main lessons in this movie are to be nice to each other, but I don't remember it being profoundly Biblical. I know that they've put it on qubo in the past, I'm not sure if it's on currently. We found this at our library, and the kids liked it so much I bought the movie for them. The 3-2-1 Penguins is no competition for Veggie Tales, Bob and Larry will always hold a special place in my heart."
2,explain please,"im interested but i need more information to how the work, and are there any pictures of them in use so i can see the quality"
1,Boring!!!,"This is one of the worst anime I have ever seen. It was so boring and stupid and made no sense at all. I guess it would have helped if I had bought the previous three volumes.The voice acting was ok, although I only listened to the English. The opening theme song was horrible and I didn't like the excessive fan service. It was kind of annoying.I hope I don't run across another mindless anime like Magic User's Club EVER again."
1,I HATED IT,"I did not enjoy this DVD one bit. It did not make any sense, probably because I did not even watch any of the first 3 DVDS. I think all the imagining of undressing and big ... are a mockery to young girls and women, and I do not approve of people watching it. I hope it gets better, but until it does, this is the only installment I will buy of it."
4,Godrey Cambride Pulls It Off!,"I saw this movie back in the seventies, and I laughed today like I did back then. It's very comical, but displays the ignorance of racism. The ending is slightly disappointing, but for the most part, it is a very entertaining movie. Thumbs up!"
3,STILL WATERS RUN DEEP ? NO. WATERMELON MAN RUNS DEEP!,"Watermelon Man...was a very courageous and creative effort to depict caucasian racists attitudes prevalent 25-30yrs ago in a humorist and insightful context that encourages a viewer to step out of a stagnate and prejustice cultural box to take a risk to ""take a walk in another's shoes"". While very funny in isolated scenes and contexts, one cannot escape the fact that this film is thought provoking."
2,"""The Thing With Two Heads"" with PITS","This contrived, stilted ""social comedy"" is about as entertaining as waiting on line during a busy day at the Division of Motor Vehicles--Godfrey Cambridge is wasted and struggles to be interesting with the ludicrous script--An early 70's movie that looks like a lost episode of the old BILL COSBY Tv series--Not much watermelon, but plenty of PITS"
5,The Watermelon Man puts a new twist on comedy.,"The Watermelon Man may be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, but it is hilarious. I can't believe that someone was allowed to make this movie. I understand that there is an underlying message, but it's WAY underneath the surface. Watch this movie for the laughs and the total disbelief that people would actually make this thing."
2,I like Godfrey Cambridge in just about anything,"except this movie. Looking at this movie today it really is so contrived. But, I guess it's not fair to judge this movie from today's standards. I never got the point of it. Apples and Oranges. And if a black person woke up one morning and was white what whould happen? Would it be the opposite of everything in this movie? I thought it was very silly and pointless. But, that's my opinion."
1,WARNING: FULL OF LIES!!!,"George Geftakys is the founder of a Christian cult called the ""Assemblies of George Geftakys"". To find out the full story, google ""Assembly Reflections"". He was excommunicated from his own group for serious sin. His teachings in this book are GRAVELY in error. This is spiritual poison, pure and simple. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!"
3,good book,my boss has been in the telecom field longer then I have been alive and he said it was a pretty good book. I have no problems with it and am still going through it.
2,Doesnot meet expectations,"I bought this book based on the last-page write-up. Auther seems to deviate from his aim. He couldnot remembred target audiance as he promised.Friends, You will enjoy reading following books instead this one offered by Steven Shepard. Read in mentioned sequence and you will definately be confident into VoIPVoice over IP First-Step by Kevin WallaceCarrier Grade Voice Over IP by Daniel Collins"
3,not so naughty or so nice...,"Disappointing. I couldn't get into either story. I read the first one from start to finish. I just think 4 years together, and having no real truth between you, not much of a relationship... and the BDSM stuff just didn't seem real or hot enough for me. So that didn't work - and the whole plot was too reminiscent of the Escape song lyrics (which I always remember as the Pina Colada song)The second section really didn't work for me, what with his insta love, and then putting BDSM on top of that... That one I skimmed.Not particularly well written, shallow characters, and no real sexual tension. This goes into the reswap pile."
4,hot and sexy,"What can I say about Naughty Nights, well those two stories sure are hot and sexy. I would very much like to meet my own O'Malley brother. Sean can dominate me any time he wants."
5,"Witty Story, Wonderful Watercolors","This is one of my favorite children's books. It treats Sam's worries, typical of other children's worries (lost library books, monster under bed, stolen cookies, vampires, etc.) in a funny but understanding manner. And the illustrations of Sam and his companion in worry--his teddy bear--are simply precious.Buy it now before it goes out of print."
2,"Not Bad, But Misses Small Chunks","There are some good aspects to this sifter. It has good capacity, and it has a hand crank instead of those hand-cramping squeeze-actuated operators. However, if you crank too fast, it flings stuff out the top. The whisk has too much clearance over the screen, so small clumps, particularly of cocoa, are missed; you end up stuffing your fingers into the unit to crush the lumps through the screen. Lastly, it's difficult to clean, so stuff gets carried over; the screen attachment points collect fines, and water just sets it in. In all, mine's headed for the garage sale. I prefer the simple ring sifter: no moving parts, good capacity, easy to clean, but a bit messy if you aren't careful."
4,Classic Santana with a few new touches,"The Batuka and Soul Sacrifice are worth the watch alone. As a big Santana fan since the 70's, I loved this concert footage."
4,"Beautiful, High-energy Music","This is a wonderful DVD of a live Santana concert we believe in Mexico - can't be sure. But, the music is just very good and the level of energy high and the atmosphere intense. One of the best music DVDs I've seen."
4,The reference DVD,"For all Santana fans, This DVD is a must buy one. Here you can hear and see Carlos and his band at their best. The concert is performed at Mexico, the native country of Santana.The audience was extremely great. They love him and enjoy his music, and they deserve a star to their own, for making the DVD incredibly alive. Santana is the best for all those long years, and it's strange how he's atracting all those different generations with different tastes. Also his GREAT keyboardist Chester Thompson is unbelievable.The only drawback of this DVD is the audio, which is set at the Dolby 2.0 format(only 2 channels)."
5,SUPER CONCERT,"THIS CONCERT TOOK ME BACK TO THE 70'S & 80'S, AND IT ALSO TOOK ME BACK TO THE OLD WAREHOUSE CONCERT DAYS BACK IN NEW ORLEANS. THE BEST CONCERT I HAVE SEEN WITHOUT LEAVING MY HOUSE. :)"
1,TAKE BACK THE STAR,"SPOILED MY HOLIDAY, COUNT BE WATCHED US OR CANADA. MARA MARS SHOULD PUT THIS IN BOLD LETTERS.HAD TO PAY S/H TWICE. I TAKE BACK THE STAR,"
5,ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT,"This is one of the best concerts ever by anyone, right up there with the best of Eric Clapton. I am thrilled to have it. DON'T MISS THIS ONE. This was so impressive, I looked up Santana.com, found his tour info, and bought tickets to an upcoming concert. This video is nothing short of fabulous."
2,santana sacred fire,"Good Sound but I am not satisfied with the edition, too many camera changes, they don`t focus on anything, they constantly move and the quality of the image is also poor however in terms of santana performance is good I would recomend ""live by request"" insead of sacred fire."
5,I been trying to get my hands on it for 2 yrs.,"I saw the video on KCET three years ago, Cinco de Mayo. A friend of mine was over and she recorded it. She has since move out of the area and I no longer have access to it. EVERY time we viewed the video, it was awesome, inspiring. We would dance, have a few drinks, sing and reminisce. We have been to several Santana concerts and this live concert is one of the best concerts I have ever seen. My older brother who moved and relocated his family to Mexico seldom has the opportunity to see or hear American music. I mailed him a copy of a Simply Red Live video and he expressed how much he enjoyed viewing it. We talked about this Santana concert I saw and he asked me to please find it and send to him. It dawned on me to call KCET and they gladly provided the information. I'm immediately purchasing two. One for him and one for me. ADIOS AMIGOS..............."
4,This is not a surround sound DVD,"The music performed on this DVD is top notch. The band is great and are clearly having fun playing together. There's some really nice conga-playing here. However, this DVD is not in 5.1 surround sound. There are two options under audio setup, PCM Stereo and Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo. I originally bought this DVD because I thought it had 5.1 Dolby and/or DTS. But the 2-channel audio is excellent. I prefer the Dolby Digital 2.0 to the PCM stereo, but then that's just me.If you like Santana or then Sacred Fire is a must-have. Even if you just like good percussion-playing, then this DVD is worth a look. I don't think you'll be dissappointed."
5,Carlos Santana: Sacred Fire - Live in Mexico,"If you like electric guitar music with a Spanish/Mexican style, you will simply love this music video. Santana has never been better. I turn it on in the evening to exericise to and dance to for my weight reduction program. It gets me into the most active and happy mood to exercise. I recommend it to all of you, especially the baby boomers!"
1,I guess you had to be there ....,"Anybody that has been at, or perhaps should I say 'in', a santana concert certainly must remember it's the atmosphere that whafts around the stadium that perhaps increases the heartbeat rather than just the music. I was concerned when I bought this disc that Carlos may just be doing a 'sell out' or try to shove some non classic music down my throat.I was right, on both counts, sure he squeezed four of his best and clsssics into the middle of his concert with 'Black Magic W, Gypsy Queen, Oye Como Va', and 'Samba' while the rest of the disc is jam packed with 14 ho hummers .....In my mind the standard for classic super group DVD's still has to be Fleetwood Mack's 'The Dance' DVD ......You have to be a real hard core Santana fan and put up with his antics to enjoy this Santana DVD ......"
5,simply mind blowing,"SANTANA SACRED FIRE, IS ONE OF THE BEST DVDS I HAVE SEEN.ITS FAST PACE, AND THE AUDIENCE EVEN MAKES IT FASTER.CONSIDERING IT WAS MADE IN 1993,THE SOUND MIX WAS SUPERB ESPECIALLY IN DTS,WHERE THE SEPARATION OF THE FRONT AND SURROUND CHANNELS WAS OUTSTANDING,BASS TO WAS CLEAN AND VERY CONTROLLED.SUPERNATURALWAS VERY GOOD BUT THIS WAS EVEN BETTER.YOU COULD SEE THE YOUNGER SANTANA HERE AT HIS VERY BEST WITH FINGER TIP PRECISSION WHILE PLAYING THE GUITAR.ALL IN ALL A GREAT DVD,IF YOU SEE THIS ONE BUY IT NOW AND DONT LET IT SLIP OUT OF YOUR HANDS ONE OF THE VERY BEST."
5,"Great music, great footage, great people","Maybe my rewiew is biased as I am a Santana fan for many many years. But as a music collector, I have a good judgment about what is quality musicianship, music, sound, and interpretation. From that point of view, the Sacred Fire dvd is all about that.If you like Santana's music, you will enjoy that prestation which will energize your life each time you will play the dvd. I totally agree with a precedent review : Peoples in there, both the crowd and musicians, are making a celebration of music and life. I already had the music cd for many years, but I can't resist to buy that great concert. Enjoy, smile, trip, boogie, as long as you wish..."
4,Classic Santana,"Although it's only 2 channel, the uncompressed track sounds pretty good. This is probably the only good sounding classic Santana disc out there. The picture quality, at 480, is lousy at best.But then it's the music that counts anyway."
1,"Poor Quality, Bad Service","I purchased my firs set of headphones over a year ago. Within 3 months they fell appart. After endless e-mails, the manufacturer agreed to replace them. My second set lasted 6 months with barely any use. I attemted to contact the company to no avail. I shipped the headphones to the same place I did the fist time and they never replaced them or sent them back. I still haven't heard from them. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!"
4,HALF & HALF,As for the book it's great and very helpful. I am learning everything I need to prepare myself for state boards. What I was disappointed was how the book was marked up with highlights areas everywhere. The person who sold it to me said in their description that there was very little marks in the book...NO TRUE.
3,idea is good,"i just introduced it to my 19 month old son.. but before giving it to him i tested it out myself to see how it worked... it doesn't leak if you turn it over, but... if you squeeze the bottle its like a supersoaker. He hasn't used it enough yet to give a true review."
1,NO MICHAEL HERE,"I have read every page of this book and am greatly disappointed. The pages are filled with distortions and contradictions to the Teachings as expressed through other works. The Author seems only interested in claiming an edge on the Teachings as an authority, but comes across as self-indulgant and overcompensating. It is the only ""michael"" book I have read where the material seems stolen and regurgitated as personal discoveries. There are personal spins on previously solid information that could create confusion for those interested in these Teachings for the first time. The Michael Teachings in and of itself is the most phenomenol body of information for undertanding ourselves in the scheme of things, but I would only add this book to your shelf if you can find no other."
5,One Vengence Arc is Completed,"In this long awaited set of episodes, Sano completes his fight with Anji, and Saito fights Usui, but the real drama comes from a suprise ""vengence"" fight between Kenshin and Aoshi. Aoshi swore to kill Kenshin (or be killed) way back in episode fifteen, and finally gets his chance to avenge the slaughtered members of his group. Kenshin, however, is restrained by a promise to bring Aoshi back to Misau. When Aoshi launches a ""no holds barred"" attack--can Kenshin defeat him without reverting back to Battousi the Man Slayer? Meanwhile, just to keep you on your toes, three members of the Juppengata turn up with 150 armed soldiers to take out Kauro, Yahito, and Misau... and grandpa cannot help them because of his previous fight with Aoshi! Will Kenshin's master arrive to save the day... or is all lost? This series of episodes is packed with suprises! It's a must!!!! (...)"
4,The Best Of The Best,"Yeah I Bought This Too And this one of the best dvd's you can get in the series. The Only ones that I Could say by any chance that is better would probadly be ""Innoncence And Experince"" and ""Fire Relclium"" and posibly ""Heart of the Sword"". sorry if I mispelled anything (LOL)!!"
5,Animal analogues: very funny,"Wood, Robert Williams (1908) Animal Analogues: Verses And Illustrations (Denatured Series No 24). New York and San Francisco: Paul Elder and Company.Reviewer: Palmer, W. P.This short work of verse and drawings was produced by one of the world's great experimental physicists for his chldren. It is intended to be humerous and will not take more than half an hour to read, but in spite of being a century old, it retains some amusing ideas. Some titles are:The bee - the beet - the beetleThe doe - the dodoThe ape - the grapeThe antelope - the cantelopeEtcI hope the reader finds and enjoys the humour of this little book.BILL PALMER"
5,BEST DEAL OF MY LIFE ( SO FAR),I cannot be more satisfied with my purchase. Not only was this TV a great Price to begin with it was later discounted even more. I wrote Amazon about it and next day there was a refund for the diference!! is this great customer service or what?Whith such a great price i was able to buy aditional equipement for the tv : wall mount( 75 US) and one of samsung's Home theather sistems( the smalest one) wich was also a great deal @ 193 USIf you are looking for a HDTV that will blow you ( and all the people you ll brag to about ) away this is the way to go. I bought mine thinking it would be too big... Now im thinking i culd have gone for the 52 or even the 60. IF YOU READ THIS REVIEW AND ARE UNCERTAIN: BUY THIS TV YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT
2,Great picture until you get screen burn-in,I use this TV for my baby to watch Noggin which isn't HD. After a few weeks of use the Noggin channel logo and side black bars burned into the screen. I tried using the burn-in removal feature (Samsung recommends running it for 1+ hour )which only helps about %30. I guess this is one of the biggest draw back of plasma TVs. Totally unacceptable. This was my first plasma and will probably be my last.
3,Looks great at first - develops problems over time,"This was our first major TV purchase. New house needed a 50"" plasma over the fireplace. It looked really great for the first two years, then developed snow all over the picture when first turned on. The snow would go away within the first half hour once everything got warmed up. Called Samsung. They acknowledged it was a known issue, but would do nothing because we are beyond warranty. I checked online and many others have the same problem. The repair is about five hundred, but most have said the problem comes back.Not a good experience, and it will probably cause me to stear away from Samsung in the future."
2,Horrible Image Retention,"I've had this tv for under a year. The image retention (IR) is progressively getting worse. At this point, if there is a static graphic on the screen for as short as 3-5minutes, I'll have IR for several minutes after. And yes, I have all the settings that are supposed to deter this problem. Note on page 3 of the manual at the bottom it states that burn-in and IR are NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY!!! Despite not being covered, when I called about the problem, I was referred to the local warranty repair shop and they attempted to fix the problem by replacing the pc boards (not sure exactly which ones). That didn't help at all. Then they took the tv to their shop. After which they informed me that the problem wasn't covered. If it isn't covered why did they even try to fix it to begin with???I am extremely disappointed with this product."
4,Great TV! Awesome Picture! Occasional HDMI audio drop,"I've had this TV for a while now and have been very happy. It's great having all of the input options. I have experienced the occasional audio dropout when using HDMI as others have referenced, but I know only use the HDMI for video processing and route the audio through a receiver so problem solved for me!"
3,Big and cheap but has image retention,"I had a Hitachi plasma prior to this that never had burn-in or image retention problems, ever. So needless to say I was not worried about this when buying a plasma. I figured the technolgy would be the same because I bought the Hitachi almost 2 years ago. Know I understand what image retention really is. It retains images pretty quickly, I thought this would go away after the ""break-in"", but it still does it. If you do the scrolling screen burn in feature it goes away. It is a big TV and has a great picture for the price, but if you are going to not like the fact that it does have image retention that goes away I would not buy it. However the better plasmas are probably going to run over a grand more. Overall I would say I would definitely buy it again, but the image retention is a pain in the butt."
2,Happy only lasted 60 hours,"Well folks I bought my 5054 back in October of last year from here and recieved a great price from Amazon. I finshed my new family room in Jan 08 and mounted it up on the wall. It had a great picture and I was pleased with all the features until now. It only has about 60 hours on it and blank, just like that the picture quit today. I have sound but when it power I don't hear that final click that turns on the screen. just 1 click after the start up. I thought I would be the lucky 1 who slips through the cracks and enjoys endless years of quality picture. i will write back and let you know how long it takes to get fixed under the 1 year warranty."
1,Poor Warrantee coverage,"Purchased product after reading all the excellent reviews.Initially, picture was excellent as well as the cost.Plasma developed a spot that grew over time. A Samsung tech came out and agreed the spot was due to a defective panel. Samsung then rejected the warrantee claim due to the fact that they will not cover any burn-in, even from a defect. Unfortunately for the customer that Samsung, will not stand by the quality of their product. I will be purchasing a Sony to replace my Samsung once the screen becomes unwatchable. It's a shame because it was a great plasma for a short time."
2,Read this review if you play video games,I bought this TV in January and loved it. Eventually I noticed a flickering problem where the screen brightness would flicker up and down. Read about it on the AVS forums and got it fixed through Samsung support. Then I noticed the image retention. If you play any xbox 360 games or watch tv in 4:3 with sidebars it will show up. You can run the screen burn in program that will eventually wipe it off but it always comes back next time you play. Ever play GTA4? See that radar in the bottom left? That is always going to be on your TV after you are done playing. The longer you go without wiping it with the cleaner the longer it will stay on there. If you play video games do yourself a favor and don't buy this set. I sold mine and am saving for another set preferably LCD. I just wanted to warn people trying to decide which set to buy. Avoid this set.
5,It is just silly how well this TV performs...,"If I sat you down in front of this TV (Samsung HPT5054 50"" Plasma HDTV), you would buy one. You would not delay. You would pull out your iPhone, log into Amazon, and punch in your credit card number.I am serious.It is silly. The HD picture is nearly perfect. No complaints. Fast action, it's great. Dark scenes, it's great. Computer graphic wipes and logos, it's great. I have it in a very brightly lit living room, it's great. Even on low-def signals (digital from DirecTV), it does very well. Most plasma or LCD set struggle with low-def. This set does very well with it.Ok, so now buy it.I am serious. Did you buy it yet? I can't believe I waited. Just do it, you will not regret it."
2,"Loved This TV, until the Samsung Clickfest kicked in","Bought this TV almost 3 years ago, and loved it so much that I just bought another one. Wish I hadn't.There is an issue w/Samsung TV's where after 2-3 years of use, they will not turn on right away. Try googling ""samsung clicking"" and you'll see what I mean.I think enough of their TV's do this to where it warrants being called a manufacturer's defect. Samsung, however, refuses to do anything about it. They're happy to send out service, of course, for a huge fee.I hate to give this a 2-star rating, because up until a week ago, I was loving every minute of this TV. It's still awesome when it finally does turn on, but buyer beware as soon as your warranty runs out, so do the TV's functions..."
3,Same problem as others Random Audio drop out from HDMI,"I just received this tv last month, Oct. 2007, and I'm having the same trouble with audio randomly dropping out of the HDMI inputs. I've tested to see if it's the cable box or the PS3, but it does it with both. I've also tested different cables and it still does it. The problem is with the TV. I'm in the process now of figuring out how to get this fixed. Be aware, you may not want to deal with this problem that a lot of these tv's have apparently from the other reviews I've read recently."
5,"Samsung HPT5054 50"" Plasma HDTV",This TV is very user friendly. There are menus to adjust everything. The picture is great. It is very easy to set up. I am extremely pleased with this purchase.
2,Nice Picture But mine was tilted?,"I just returned mine to Vanns.com for teh tilt reason- I think the stands are defective, although I have seen some that were fine.Crazy, though I was the only one.B"
1,"arrived broken, technical service sucks!",this tv arrived today clearly broken. spent 20 minutes with samsung technical support on the phone with guy whom i struggled to understand. the best he could do is to contact technician who will in turn contact me in 48 hours...to tell me that the tv does not work. DUH.i expected more after dropping $1500+ on this. Going to return it and buy something solid from a different manufacturer.
1,"samsung 50"" plasma HPT5054","I would love to write a review about this product, however i ordered this off of AMAZONS website and have been waiting two weeks for it!!! the price was great and free shipping was awesome BUT, i tracked the package which wasnt much help and after calling the ceva shipping company and being transferred SEVEN different times i finally gave up, hopefully ill get the TV eventually guess i dont know because there isnt ANYBODY TO TALK TO!!!! great price but if you order it from AMAZON get ready to wait and keep your fingers crossed that youll get it."
2,gimmick,"Simply put, the Bose 3-2-1 series (all of them) DO NOT produce true 5.1/7.1 sounds.I was able to find two demo unit in a nearby electronic retail chain, and the demo film features X-men 2 (the F-16 chasing/tornado sequence). Since I do have a 5.1 setup and also the X2 DVD, I did a comparison of them. My finding is that in the case of Bose 3-2-1, I can't hear any sound sweeping from back to front, and on the contrast my 5.1 setup at home does that much better than the Bose ones. Additionally, the Bose units have too much bass, which results in a ""pounding"" experience, but not true to the real dynamics of the sounds from the movies.Yes, it does sound better than your TV, but for true surround sounds, go find yourself a REAL 5.1/7.1 setup, you are much better off, trust me."
1,its really that bad...,"This product doesn't belong on the market. The reasons why owners won't fess up to all of the problems that they are having with the DVD player is that:1) they are incredibly embarrassed to be swindled by the marketing2) they don't want to destroy the resale value until they've unloaded theirsSadly the owners of this machine aren't folks who do research, they are impulsive buyers. I hope you discover these postings within your 30 day returns period.Imagine your movie night blown when you put in a brand new DVD, because the unit either says ""format unsupported"" or ""cannot read disc"" and then won't eject the disc to let you play it on your computer. :)"
1,"Marketing at it's best, Product at it's worst.","After comparing the 3.2.1 Bose system with their 30 day money back guarantee to my neighbors system (Paradigm Speakers and Pioneer receiver). It went back in the box and back to the store.His system was almost identical in cost, and light years better. I don't know how any of the other reviewers can rate this system so high except that they purchased blind with out ever comparing it directly to any competition. What a costly mistake.The sound from my neighbors setup was full, rich, tight smack you in the chest base. The Bose was thin, dull, muddy.Whew! Glad I used my brain and compared to another system. Boy I would have looked stupid rating 5 stars for the system had I not heard what a REAL surround sound system is supposed to sound like."
1,Worst Mistake I've Ever Made,"Sound is good, but the dvd player is the worst machine ever. My 36 dollar dvd player actually out performs this one by a long shot. It won't open or close 99 percent of the time and then when it does, cannot read disc. I have since read about other having this problem, not getting the player to open or close. Here it is Fri. night, put in dvd, won't play and cannot retreive it to plug in somewhere else. PLEASE, spend your money on something other than this system."
3,"Good Sound, very limited options","If all you want is good sound and simple set up, this is for you. BUT for the cost, they should have given it a DVD player that would play jpegs, avi files and all the rest like my $25 JVC one does. It kicked out my 40 Year Old Virgin DVD the day I bought the system, and is very select about what DVD's, and yes, they are all purchased in the good old USA, that it decides to play. If I had my way, it would go back to the store, but my husband insists that we can still use the JVC one for other DVD's, what a waste!"
1,What's the best thing about Bose?,"Their money-back policy.My neighbor bought one of their pseudo-surround systems and exercised such policy within a week, much helped by coming over to my house and listening to a REAL home theater system, which actually cost a couple hundred less.The second best thing about Bose is that they do have very nice-looking industrial design, most of their products are admittedly quite attractive. But you know the old saw, ""Beauty is as beauty does.""Surround sound with 3 speakers? I'm surprised they don't promise you the Tooth Fairy jumping out of the subwoofer too."
3,Where's the bang?,"I ended up getting the Bose system the same day I spent $2500 on a new HDTV, with the idea that I would have the best sound and look avaliable...In the store the system sounded great! The demo was playing Lord of the Rings...but when I got home, listening to regular movies or tv there is no surround sound about it...The pros are the size and looks. I like the fact that my living room doesn't have a large shelf system or 5 or 6 speakers arranged all over the place. The sound quality is very nice, I like the radio feature and the remote. The progressive DVD player has a quality picture...but the sound didn't ""wow"" me when I got it home. For the money, I need ""wow""...The con is the price, I think there is a lot more out there that you could get and still have some money in your pocket."
2,a DVD player which does not play DVD's,"Never played DVD's very well. The sound seems to be not fully coordinated with the images. After a year stopped reading any DVD with even minimal imperfections. After a year and a half stopped playing even brand new DVDsLooks good, but I would not buy it again"
5,Best 2.1 System on the market,"I compared the Bose 321 Series II system with the Sony and Denon 2.1 systems. No comparison in terms of sound quality. Denon and Sony have some very nice features but if your goal is sound quality then you can't beat Bose. The system is very easy to setup and use. If you don't have room for rear channel speakers or don't want to run wires all over the room 2.1 systems are the way to go, but keep in mind they are not true surround sound. This system is also very good for just listening to music and has a decent AM FM tuner."
2,It's awful,"I bought this system four months ago. I'm not happy with my purchase for the following reasons:1) sound constantly drops off2) you have to turn the volume WAY up to get the full ""surround effect""3) systems mysteriously shuts down on its own4) DVD picture is not good as a stand-alone DVD player5) Limited options and inputs6) expensive and over-priced for what you get.My verdict...save your money and buy another system."
5,I love this system!,"I just hooked up my Bose 3.2.1 Series II system tonight and am completely thrilled with it. Totally easy to hook up. Rich surround sound, even without rear speakers, that's perfect for my small living room. Gets so loud it shakes my windows... I'm sure my neighbors are thrilled too ;) The universal remote works with my TV and my digital cable box! I'm am more then satisfied with this system. I LOVE IT!"
2,Overpriced and underperforming,"A typical Bose product -- marketed with lots of hype, expensive, and performs much less well than other systems that cost at least 30-40 percent less. The sound is uneven, and your options for dubbing etc are very limited. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,A Girlie System for Girlies--Not worth the price,"This is an easy system to set up. So what? What is there to it? I rate it equivalent to a set of Harmon Kardon Soundstick II's. For $119, I'll take the H/K's and buy three or four sets.The Bose System offers a built in Hard Drive to store your music on MPEG files, but doesn't offer a good way to organize your music.For this kind of money, buy a 17"" iMac G5 and a set of Sound Stick II's and you will be a whole lot happier. Shove your Cd's in and you will have space for a lot more than a the Bose system will store, plus the ability to display movies and visualizations--and have a bug-proof, boomb proof computer."
2,Flake-y,"Save yourself the money - this book's contents are common sense and a blinding flash of the obvious to anyone who has been working in business for more than a few years. Got an extra star because it did make me laugh in places!Buy a copy of Robert Ringer's book Winning through intimidation instead, which IMHO is 1000% better value"
1,Cheap and hard to deal with putting in DVDs,"Do not buy this product! Whatever you do, go with another DVD player. It's a real pain putting in a DVD. You need to make sure you have it clicked in right, or it will jam. I actually scratched a few DVDs not getting it all click into its round motorized holder."
1,Worthless Piece of Crap,"unfortunately, yes i happen to have one of these sucky dvd players. On some original dvd movies it plays flawlessly with minor errors. on some dvd backups it totally will not play. there is also some weird grinding noise inside when its reading the disc like its tearing it apart so beware when thinking about buying this piece of sh**, you have been warned. I guess its a loss but not a bad loss considering the price. Do yourself a favor and invest a little more on something that will last you a lot longer than this."
2,good deal if it'd work,I received this DVD player as part of a promotion. It works great to read DVDs but the remote control doesn't work. Even universal remotes can't control it. Hence I can not navigate in the menu... so I am really glad I didi not pay for it but I would otherwise not recommend it.
3,works fine to me.,Works well for back up. I only bought it because i needed a dvd player for the road and it did what I payed for.
3,OK FOR THE PRICE,"I bought this DVD player about 2 years ago for $19.99 at a retail store. I can definitely say that I got my moneys worth out of it, but I had to work for it. What most of the other reviewers here have said is true: it skips and freezes. I also found that the remote wouldn't work unless I was right in front of and up close to the television. I'm replacing it because it now won't play at all and has started making this horrible grinding noise. Oh well, what can you expect for $19.99? If you're only going to use it now and then, it's fine. But for your primary DVD player, do the research, read other customer reviews, and buy something that will undoubtedly cost more, but will be more durable and of better quality."
2,Not the best of DVD players :(,"When I initially got this product, was looking for something inexpensive just to play my workout dvd on since my laptop crashed. When I received it, the 1st this I fell in love with was the size: small and quaint. It was easy to travel with and easy setup and installation: just plug it in! After a while, when I wanted to watch full length motion picture dvds, theCoby DVD-207 Compact DVD Playerstarted to over-heat, skip scenes, and eventually shut down. I was very disappointed with that! I've now learned to only use the player in small portions at a time (no more than 30mins), but I'm really tempted to return it and get my money back! NOT WORTH IT!!!"
3,small but fussy,"I bought this product because the price was right and it fit in the space that I had available. However, it skips around and stops too often. I thought it was the dvd, but the same thing happened on all the disks I tried. It also gets very hot. I kept it, it works after it's been on for a while. I'm satisfied with the product I got for the price I paid."
1,sucks,i bought 15 of these dvds for my store i thought i could sale crazy becouse price was really good even if i buy from coby company there price its $27 shipped and here i only paid $20 shipped i was gonna order 200 pcs but good thing i didnt well make the story short i opened 1 for display picture was really bad and after 2 hours it was making really big noise anyway i sold 10 of them and 5 of them brought it back ..lolz so i had to give them cash refund other 5 migh come back soon since i have 30 days money back guarantee lolz i would say dont buy it its peice of junk..
1,DO NOT BUY,"This DVD player Scrambles up the subtitles and sometimes the screen freezes either with my DVD-R Backups or The Original movie... it doesnt even play the original movie right!!!! Don't waste your money, don't buy just because of the price, spend a little more and get something that actually works!"
4,For the price,"You cant really go wrong with this little fella! For the price what do you expect? I got mine in wal-greens and it has been perfect in my bedroom. Its nothing fancy, nothing special but it plays dvds and thats really all you wanted for right! Great fro travel too - i hook it up to the hotel tv when i travel and i can watch my movies of choice rather than spending the money on the Pay Per Veiw movies - It plays DVDs what more do you want!!!"
1,a real piece of junk,Buyers BEWARE this player is trash. I am dropping my player in the trash.What a waste of money!!!!! Won't play DVD and if you so happen to get it too play it skips and it will make you mad.
1,A product that never works and then dies,"Bought this one , was happy to get it for such a low price,however when i recived it , the product hardly worked, made lot of physical sound while playing .After three month of usage found that the product has stopped working.The motor has stopped working, I guess the manufacturer knows that the product will hardly work for 90 days and hence gives only 90 days of limited guarantee"
2,nice price -- short life,"i picked this baby up from my college bookstore a few months ago because it was small and cheap and we needed to replace our Cyberhome model which decided not to work anymore. it looks cute, and the picture quality is ok, however it no longer wants to play entire DVDs...it seems like the once the reader goes out to a certain point, the player will start skipping and then eventually give up. of course, this usually coincides with the dramatic climax of whatever movie is in there, so it becomes THAT MUCH more frustrating. sigh. also, what the other reviewer said about the player running hot is true! it has never melted anything of mine, but it does get unreasonably heated. if you can, i would recommend investing in something sturdier/from a bigger brand name."
1,Never buy this product from Amazon.com,"I bought this DVD player from Amazon.com for $31 considering it to be a very good deal with free shipping. It is dual voltage (world compatible) etc etc. When I tried playing new DVDs it does not play smoothly.Also, it does not play DVD+-R at all. Same DVD plays very well on computer. I returned this product back to Amazon. To my surprise Amazon just refunded me $13 (whereas I paid $31). It kept more than half of my money....really bad return experience. If you want to try this cheap product (if love cheap stuff), get it from a physical shop where you could return with full refund. Good Luck with this product!!"
1,Dead in 4 months,I bought two of these things from F.Y.E and were both non-functional by 4 months. Complete waste of money.
2,Functionable but Not Great,"I purchased this product from Amazon.com. The first one I received had a serious defect (and wouldn't even turn on, in fact), so Amazon paid for me to send it back and get a new one. The 2nd one is small, but gets noisy and shows a fuzy picture when the player gets too hot. Basically, you're paying $30 for a cheap DVD player, so don't expect too much out of it. It functions--that's it."
1,do not buy this,i got one of these for $20 at walgreens. it is the worst piece of anything i have purchased ever. it does not play most dvds. the ones it does play tend to skip and freeze.
3,Get a warranty,"I got this DVD player, and it worked right off the bat. However, about a month after I bought it, it started having an issue with playing a DVD. The picture became pixelatted, and the audio was off-sync with the video.However, it was only $25, and I invested $5 in getting the 1-year replacement plan for electronics. Man, am I glad I did - this DVD player doesn't look like it's going to last the year."
3,You get what u pay for,"I have been using this for more than a month and i feel it depends on the individual to go for it or not .Pros :1. Cheap2. Easy insallation3. complete setCons :1. Lil scratch and it wont play2. Heats up real quick and has problems due to that at the end of movie as it is more than an hour .3.very unreliable piece of dvd player will play when it like , someday it will play the same dvd and other day it will say not detected .so if u just want a rough dvd player go for it or else wait for some good deals .BUT DEFENITLY WORTH OF THE MONEY. u can ge this as the second one or so ."
1,Piece if junk,"When I bought this player, I was impressed by the design and looks. After using it for less than a month, its started showing the disc reading issues. Even if a new DVD is put in the player,and the top is closed it says close top. Then its giving reading issues with almost all DVD's. It took me only a month to buy new DVD player. This is the last COBY product I will ever buy."
1,Piece of Junk,"I got this DVD Player couple of months ago. Everytime when i played the DVD, it gives Open, No Disc errors and makes some grinding noise.I would advise not to buy this junk. I would rather spend $30 more and get a branded one."
4,Functionality & features outdoes the need for form & ease of use,"This unit is portable, plays all burned media, any country code, both NTSC and PAL video, and most of all this damn thing was cheap for what you get. Note: I only paid ~$35 after shipping. The down side is the remote control is small with bubble buttons, the advance (similar to fast forward) typically has a small delay, and finally you have to occasionally reseat DVDRs for them to start. I found that DVDRs have to be placed in just right. Its not enough of a problem to overshadow the good things that this unit does."
1,"""You get what you pay for!""",I will be returning this DVD player! It is cheap and doesn't work very well! Every movie I've tried to play in it messes up! I wounld NOT recommend buying it!
2,Makes too much noise,"All in all, the Coby DVD player works, but the noise is far more annoying than I thought it would be. I have a family, and sometimes I wan't to watch a DVD while other members of the family are asleep. So, I turn the volume down. Yet, when the volume of the TV is low, the loud humming noise of the DVD player becomes even more audible, and annoying. I'm returning it."
2,In total honesty...,"As I'm writing this review (sort of), I am hearing a skipping sound coming from the player.First of all, I can't really complain since I got this DVD player for about a dollar [...]. I won it from a Flaming Finger arcade game, but now I wish I would have chosen another prize.a.) It does make a lot of noise! Too much if you ask anyone.b.) It doesn't read a DVD every once in a while, then it does for some f*cked up reason.c.) It's not worth it, no matter what anyone says. Then again, who am I to judge since I basically got for free.d.) If you ever win at Flaming Finger, don't go for this prize, go for either season 1 of The Simpsons, Family Guy, or American Dad. Or the wireless controller for the PS2, or the freaking digital voice recorder, but not this piece of [...]. The damn headphones might even be a better choice, or a PS2 video game for that matter."
1,PIECE OF JUNK DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!!!,"I have had to have this replaced by Amazon twice and am giving up. It's a total piece of crap. Sound and visual don't match up, stops in the middle of each DVD, just an absolute total piece of junk. It isn't worth the money or hassle. I am returning it, and will spend $30 more to make sure I get something that works! BEWARE, THIS THING IS A PIECE OF JUNK."
4,coby review,"This is a great product. I bought 20 of them for gifts; every one loved them no problems at all. They loved that it is small, light weight and compact that way they save on space. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive price and good quality. Thank You"
1,Review of Coby DVD-207 DVD Player,I regret buying it. It is difficult to manipulate. The remote control is almost useless.
3,Worth the Money!!,This one is a real worth for the money. Its very sleek and weightless. But the remote is not that handy and no problems whatsoever so far.
1,Do not make same mistake that I made,"I am rating single star because I cannt go less than that. This product deserves negative 300 star. This product is cheap and looks very cheap too. Doesnt play most of my media which are mostly dvd backups and vcds. But it advertaised to play pretty much everything. It gets worse when you start using it, complain about everything like no media, open, bad format etc. It's a total garbage, doesnt even worth trying even if it's free."
5,Price is proportional to performance,"This $30 DVD-player reminds you that price is often proportional to performance. It has its own intelligence to decide whether it will let you watch a DVD or not. As you place the DVD, it starts thinking, the DVD spins with a soft buzzing sound and the TV screen says 'Loading...' with three dots proving that Coby is active. After a while Coby either puts the familiar FBI warning image or decides that the DVD is not worth watching and says 'Open' or 'No Disc' or some such thing.If you are really determined then you get up from your sofa, press the cover, switch on/off few times (a method of fixing things popularized by Microsoft) and hope Coby will change its mind.Good Night & Good Luck."
2,Didn't do what I thought it would do,I am hearing impaired and bought this to connect my wireless earphones to the digital output from my TV. My wireless earphones use a 3.5 mm jack and I thought this would connect / convert the digital to 3.5 mm. I may be using the product incorrectly.
3,Sony Optical adaptor,"Could not get the adaptor to work with the tos cable, I thing the problem was the sony optioal driver not the adaptor. could not rate more than three stars as I have not used the adaptor yet."
5,Handy dual function for laptops,"This beastie is just the thing for laptops like many recent Apple ones that have a combination headphone/mini-Toslink port. To work neatly, you need to convert from the mini-Toslink to standard Toslink, and make a right angle turn. This adaptor does both, allowing you to use any Toslink cable you already have."
5,Great product. Great price.,"Little more to be said.BUT...I use this setup to connect my Apple laptop direct to my HDTV, enjoying perfect sound.This works perfectly with Mediabridge Premium Toslink Cable (Optical Digital Audio Cable) converting my Apple Laptop's optical Mini Plug to Toslink. Because it is a right-angle adapter, it eliminates strain on the toslink, conveniently allowing it to drape to the floor before being routed directly to the TV.Apple does not currently support full regular HDMI connection. The optical mini plug must be used for sound. Sound is not sent through the Mini DisplayPort/HDMI adapter - only video."
4,Mac Mini (2009 late),Works great with the Mac Mini (2009 late version). Just for any of you googling or checking on that. Hooked into my home theater perfectly. It was also less flimsy than I thought it would be. Not sure how well it would hold up if it were being constantly plugged/unplugged or carried around in a peripheral bag.
5,Great Product!,My daughter now 13 yrs old has used most of the major brands of knee saver type products. These are the best. You have to be careful to teach the catcher not to stay on these pads but they help save the strain on the knees in between pitches.
4,On Being A Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research,This is a good introduction into the ethical demands of conducting scientific research. We read this our first year of graduate school and I recommend it to other graduate students and practicing scientists.
1,Childish and Unscholarly,"What a [sad] piece of literature. This manual should be given out to every cult member in America. The Confederate movement is nothing more than a disgruntled group of purists who cannot work within the political system to effect change. Whoever heard of such nonsense? What is sad about the battle ""flaggers"" is that they would vote for a tax increase if they could save their flag. Why not put all this energy into effecting change into our government? It is more than about a flag and no one will take your grits. Plus, who wears their culture on the sleeve except those who wish to prostitute Southern culture and turn it into something that it is not. Did the Southern soldier need a survival manual? What a joke or a boob of a book. Don't waste your time. I did, so I could analyze the elementary thought patterns of these self-proclaimed Southron Nationalists."
5,Amazing book that touched me deeply,"I first heard about this book through a friend of mine, and decided to get it for my sister, a single Mom, for the holidays. Throughout the years, she's struggled; and I realized that single motherhood is a growing, huge cultural phenomenon unlike no other that no one is addressing in magazines or books. This is a book she can totally relate to. The story is so beautifully written, about the trials and tribulations of a bunch of single mothers, who came to this position of life through their own choice or not... and demonstrates the beauty and grace through which they overcome difficult choices, and maintain dignity throughout, as modern women upholding the virtues of family. I'm giving this book to my sister who is a single mom; but I'm also buying copies for my friends, who are not, because this is such a lyrical and touching book. I highly recommend it."
4,Small that you can put in your key chain,"I ordered mine in a blue color, to be different from the classic red color.The knife is nice and light with many uses. It doesn't look to be heavy duty, as mine broke in 2 years. I will buy another Swiss Army but another model this time."
3,useful gadget,this tool has several useful functions but is not as sturdy as a standard Swiss Army tool.
2,Not convincing..,"Mostly I like the music given out by an Elephant6-band, that includes: Neutral Milk Hotel, Apples in Stereo, Of Montreal, The Essex Green and Ladybug Transistor (also Olivia Tremor Control), but this record by Circulatory System is too ""far-out"" for me. There are some clever transitions and nice harmonies here, but in the end this is all too monotonous. Floating psychedelic indie without any clear direction and highlights.. Maybe it`s me? However, I cant`t help it for still feeling uninspired listening to this record. Maybe it will change in the future, even if I doubt so. So far at least, this doesn`t make it for me."
2,blah blah blah,"God is this boring. I really really liked OTC and based on the reviews here, decided to buy this. Big mistake. this is really not interesting in the slightest. What made OTC so fantastic were the constant changes, the manic transitions between dreaminess, noise, quiet, and pure pop. This is non of that. I found it uninspired pap. If you are new to this, go check out OTC or Neutral Milk Hotel. Better yet, go listen to the Flaming Lips."
5,Five legends on the same screen,"This special episode of Doctor Who allows the viewer a capsule look at twenty years of Doctor Who history in the space of 90 minutes. The plot is typical Who, and the action flows from one scene to the other with astonishing quickness. The resolution is classic Who as well, and leaves the fan wanting more."
3,OK. Good audio bonus track.,"I purchased the DVD, as I did the video. The plot is good, and I remember as a kid loving this episode. On the DVD, you get audio track from Peter Davision and Terrance Dicks. That is actually quite good to listen to, as you watch the DVD.The ""new"" special effects in this one and the previous video are not that good, and I prefer the orginal. But all in all, good to see Patrick Trougton and the other ""docs"" reunited."
2,"Not worth the ""special edition"" label or the expense","As a long time fan of Doctor Who I was looking forward to the ""EXTRAS"" that came with this edition of the Five Doctors. They are worthless. The audio commentary is trite and often difficult to hear and the updated special effects are terrible. If you already own a copy (even VHS) keep it and don't waste your money on this. The story is a romping good time of memories and companions as well as the first five of the Doctor's incarnations so, if you've never seen this episode before, try to get a copy that doesn't say ""Special Edition."""
3,I gotta watch it again,I actually rate this 2and a half stars. The lack of technology and cheap sets kind of put me off. But there is no question about the talent of the first five Doctors. Come to think of it based on that I will upgrade the review to a 3.
3,AVERAGE WHO AT BEST,"The only thing notable about this story is that it's the 20th. anniversary story, and features a reunion of sorts, in that most of the Doctors and a fair sampling of assistants (and villains) make guest appearances. The story itself is rather weak, especially when compared to some of the great stories from each of the Doctors.It is telling that this story was chosen for release on DVD not because it was an outstanding story, but that it featured 5 Doctors in one (although actually only 3 of them were there, since William Hartnell had died years before, and Tom Baker appears in archival clips from an unfinished story).Having said that, it's still a mildly entertaining ride, and I'll watch it again sometime, but it just doesn't compare to some of the finer Who stories -- thus, it only rates 3 stars. Some of the other DVD releases have a little more in the way of special features, as well."
3,5 Doctors DVD?,"DVD means digitally versatile disk. This normally includes:commentary,branching (watch as original or new enhanced version)tv trailers,interviews & a photo gallery. Sometimes even an easter egg (hidden extra).What you do get is some tedious muzak that you wouldn't give as a present to your least favourite in law.I couldn't see much difference between the VHS tape & the supposed DVD version.The actual story is quite good and was a special for the children in need charity telethon in the UK. If this was on VHS then it would have been worthwhile, but as a DVD it's an own goal."
4,As expected and about on time.,"This anniversary edition is a solid release. I haven't gone through all of it yet, but enjoyed the special edition version and the hidden David Tennant commentary on the original version."
4,"""The 3.5 Doctors""","Caveat emptor! The title of this Doctor Who serial is actually a misnomer. Anyone expecting to see all five (at the time) incarnations of the good Doctor will be very disappointed - first Doctor William Hartnell had died 8 years before this episode was made, and is replaced here by veteran actor Richard Hurndall. Meanwhile popular fourth Doctor actor Tom Baker, in a fit of megalomania, declined to join the production and appears only in stock footage form.So why buying this DVD at all? Well, it's still a pretty good episode. Production values are about as high as Doctor Who gets, and the performances are top notch. Dialogue and story are both a little weaker than one might hope for, but bear in mind this was an anniversary special meant for the masses. This DVD features a Special Edition of the story that has been recut to include extensive new scenes and alternative takes, changes that make this a stronger version of the episode."
3,Not enough bang for the buck,"Let me just say that Akeboshi is a very talented artist, one that I am a big fan of. Musically, I thought this CD was just OK, though. I just didn't like it as much as some of his older stuff.Even though I $18 is pretty cheap for an import CD, these 6 tracks just aren't worth $3 each. Except maybe the title track ""Yellow Moon."""
5,Photography Lighting Book Review,Although geared towards film cameras and processing it's an excellent source for studio lighting. I loved the diagrams and product set ups. This gives me a bunch of great ideas for still life shots and lighting effects. I definitely enjoyed this book!
3,Very straightforward,"This is a solid, straightforward prose translation. I think it lacks poetry, both literally and figuratively. However, it's very readable and makes a fine baseline for comparing other translations.For a prose translation that captures a bit more flavor, try E.V. Rieu. For a verse translation, I like Fagles or Fitzgerald."
3,not so great,"For all the things in the description about this mouse saying that it tracks great on any surface, it does not. I had trouble using it on several surfaces, and also had to be within about a foot of my laptop to use it. I normally love logitech products and have great luck with them, but this one, not so much."
3,SEXY TEENAGER RUNS AWAY FROM HOME,"Renee Humphrey playing what has become a kind of standard role in semi exploitation teen movies: The sexy teenager runs away from home and is exploited by dubious types and becomes a (kind of) stripper. Ms. Humphrey was later to play the role of Didi in the delightful farce ""Sex Monster"" as the lesbian lover of Meryl Hemmingway.Krista Erickson does a very nice job too as the hooker who can sing"
3,A diamond in the rough,"A powerful book, though it owes an obvious debt to Tony Daniel's seminal masterwork, ""Canoe"". Where Daniel guides, Shepard follows."
4,Zatoichi will be your hero,"I will not bother to write a different review for each Zatoichi movie. I have all twenty six of his movies and have watched all of them multiple times. Although the believability of a blind swordsman is next to nill, Zatoichi makes it believable because you will fall in love with the character. Shintaro Katsu is one of my all time favorite actors."
5,A beautiful story about adoption.,"I loved this story. It sensitively deals with the emotions and choices of the birth and adoptive mother. A great story anyway, but definitely recommend to anyone who has adopted or been adopted.The fact that the author herself has adopted 2 children, & the illustator is an adopted child is how I think they have been able to give that special touch to the story.For Christians, this story also shows answers to prayers, thanks to God for His blessing, & a simple way to teach how we are adopted into God's family.The Story of Baby Moses (Alice in Bibleland Storybooks)One Starry Night: Stop and Smell the Roses Series (Stop and Smell the Roses)"
5,Great Book for all children!!!,This is a great book for all children especially adopted children. My kids love the book!
2,About Adoption,"The kangaroo adopts a bird. It would be better if the kangaroo adopted another kangaroo. I don't want my daughters thinking they're so different from me, which is what the message is in this book."
5,Can't read with a dry eye,This is a sweet touching little story. I give this book to my friends who've adopted and they can hardly get past the first page.
3,"Fabulous book, with Christian content","A blessing from above is the story of a Mummy kangaroo who sees all the other animal families with their babies, and is sad because she very much wants a baby herself.When the baby bluebird accidentally falls out of the overcrowded nest, into Mummy kangaroo's pouch, the Mummy bluebird is happy that the baby has a nice, warm and loving place to be.My baby is too young yet to understand the story, but laughs at the pictures! I love the story as it tells all 3 sides, and shows how happy the Mummy kangaroo and baby bluebird are together afterwards.However, the book has Christian content which might not be suitable for all families, and this should be borne in mind."
2,"Sorry to say, I was not enchanted","This book (and the note by the author) displays all the good intentions in the world. But the Bible-quoting author must surely be aware of where good intentions inevitably lead. To begin with, those of us who have been through the adoption process know all too well that babies do not drop out of trees. And where the heck is DADDY Roo? This, I'm afraid, is an overly simplistic approach to a very deep subject, with lackluster illustrations. I agree with the author that the great adoption book is yet to be written. Alas, this isn't it, but there are MUCH better ones out there for this age level: Mr. Rogers, ""The Day We Met You"", Jamie Lee, ""A Mother for Choko"", to name a few."
2,Adopted babies are not accidents!,"I liked the Biblical perspective (although children of the target age don't understand the abstract concept of our adoption by God, anyway, so it's more for the parents!), but I was surprised that this story was written by adoptive mothers, because the ""adoption story"" is basically the idea that a baby bird fell out of its nest...oops!...and fell into the kangaroo's pouch and became her child. My daughters did not ""accidently"" fall into our family. Two wonderful birthmothers agonized over the decision to place their precious children in our home, and made a conscious choice to do so. This story does not reflect that type of struggle and concern on the part of the birthmother, and that bothered me."
5,ratings,I cant wait to read this book. In my opinion Fred Saberhagen is one of the best authors I ever read.
5,Why,"I totally agree, I had my whole series stolen, and trying to re-build is proving very frustrating, with only being able to get part of the series! If you are going to re-print then do all the books. The UK site doesn't even list half of them"
2,slapdash,"This is fifth-rate Tolkein involving magical swords, rapacious Templars, two wizards, the odd dragon, and a few intrepid adventurers. You've read it all before in better novels by more skilled authors. The whole book reads as if it were written at a furious pace in order to satisfy a book contract. If you have time to pass, really need some fantasy, don't mind an infantile plot and plodding dialogue and have no other choices, then pick up this book. If you want a more immersive and inventive fantasy epic, look elsewhere -- perhaps something by Feist, Eddings or Brooks."
1,Uuumm not what they say it is!,I took this for a month and I didnt see one pound missing off of my body... I thought I would take something like this cause I dont need to lose that much weight just about 15 lbs. But dont be fooled it doesnt work at all. I was even going to the gym 3 days a week when I was taking it so you decide what to make of that...
4,"Good for anxiety, but not weight loss.","I take this daily. Its doesn't work well for weight loss, but I have noticed a decrease in my stress level. For me thats enough."
4,better mood,"i think this product is great as an anti anxiety, stress reducer. it doesn't magically help loose weight, but my mood is excellent, and i actually feel like exercising and just being more active in general. i recommended it to my best friends for mood and stress and they like it too."
1,Be sure to read warnings,"I had high hopes for this product. I took only one of these pills and became so drowsy that I could not stay awake. I was willing to try taking it only around bedtime to compensate for this, but then realized that this product is NOT INTENDED FOR PEOPLE UNDER 40. It did not state this on the Amazon site. Since I am well under 40, I will be returning the Relacore."
5,A good starting place,"There are few reference works available in this category. Fortunately, this one is a useful, helpful, and clear guide to the art of making log furniture. We have yet to faithfully follow any of the authors' detailed step-by-step plans. The text and pictures were clear enough to enable us to start right off making our own derivative designs. Thanks, guys!"
4,bilding fernitur outta wuud,"I just received the book and am reading it (and getting lots of good ideas) but the spelling is atrocious!! Haven't you guys heard of EDITORS? Using a Still chainsaw to build an Amour, or use a Skill saw on your dinning table top and letter rip....oy vey."
5,RUG MAT,"Hey people! There are things called rug mats! Any rug will ""scoot around"" on hard wood unless you have a mat under it. If that is your only complaint, go spend the 9.99 it would take to get one!"
3,Cute but . . .,This is a cute rug and it matches the bedding set great but it tends to scoot around when you walk on it. It would get bunched up and I was constantly having to readjust it. So we moved it out of the way. It is still in the room but now toys sit on it when my son is not playing with them. I think the rug was a waste of money. I would not recommend buying this one.
4,"Before this start with ""COMING OF AGE"" AND""LIVE RECORD""","Well in my opinion you have to start with ""COMING OF AGE"" ,containing a selection of must have Camel tracks, and also with the fantastic live version of ""The snow Goose"", entitled ""LIVE RECORD"", which sounds much and much better than the studio album.Anyway here, if you skip ""City Life"" (the unique weak track from ""Nude"")and accept another version of the usual Lady Fantasy from ""Mirage"", which has been the song by which Andy has concluded a lot of lives, the rest is excellent stuff, even if They have forgotten here the essential ""Beached"" and ""Docks"" from ""Nude"", ""Lunar sea"" from ""Moonmadness"",plus the sweet ""Hymn to her"" from the normal AOR album""I can see your house from here""...besides of course there isn't the stuff from ""Harbour of tears"",this CD being not issued yet.Recommended, but start with ""COMING OF AGE"" and ""LIVE RECORD"" before this!!"
3,"Not as good as ""Coming of Age""","Being a camel fan, I regret to give less than 4 stars to anything Camel. Having said that, there are other Camel live performances that IMHO are (much) better than this one. You cannot compare ""ice"", while Foss Patterson was on the keyboard in ""coming of age"" to ""ice"" in this performance. While Andy's guitar remains (almost) the same, his voice is unspectacular here. ""Pressure point"" is another live CD which has, in my point of view, a higher ranking than this one, specially when the late Peter B. is playing along in ""Lady Fantasy"". All in all, if you just want to complete your Camel selection, go ahead and by this one."
2,moon over elmo...nikki monnett,"""The Moon Over Lake Elmo"" Was an ok book. The book is really confusing with all the different letters and entrys. You really dont get the book until you read to the end. At first i thought the book was really boring and it confused me, but when i read the rest of it, it all made sense. Steve Thayer is a smart writer and you could tell he really researches his stuff. Therefore the book starts really bad but ends tieing it all together..."
1,Jaun Carlos's All daring adventurous review,"To put it plainly, this book [was bad]. I didn't like the fact that you (the reader) would jump from character to character. The other thing that [I didn't like] was the fact that the man couldn't spell. One of the major things that ""angered"" me was the fact that it was so long. It was like a ... novel. Who writes 150 page books anyways?"
1,Moon over Lake Elmo review,Moon over Lake Elmo in my opinion was not a book I would ever read again. The part where it's all diary page's is what did not impress me. When it jump's from different character's so quickly in a way confused me. You also as a reader had to figure out which character played what part in the book. It would of been a good book if they had made it some what like a story instead of diary pages. For those reason's I rate this book a 1.
1,"Poor quality, stay away!","My daughter got this as a present from her grandparents and after light use, the saddle broke off while it was on a guitar stand. It never stayed in tune and sounded terrible. What an awful and disappointing product."
1,Not well made,I purchased this as an upgrade from a toy guitar. It was in our house for 2 days and was handled with care. I was really sad and disappointed as I watched my daughter playing it carefully on her lap and all of the strings just popped off taking a little wooden piece with it. This is poorly made and did not last. It is just a toy. Maybe ours was defective as I have seen some good reviews but ours did not stand up to 2 days of use. And by use I mean playing not banging it around. Two thumbs down!!!!!!
2,This book was okay.,I don't like THE KING'S EQUAL because the characters were horrible. I don't think Raphael should close the school and higher taxes. The story was about a prince who tried to be a king but he has to marry someone his equal. But the prince was arrogant . The girl was poor but she was smart and intelligent and little rich than him. I learned you shouldn't be arrogant because no one will like you.
5,Buy this book!,"I would recommend this book if only for the beautifully detailed illustrations. This is truly a wonderful book with a great message about the value of character and friendship rather than physical beauty and wealth. Not your typical fairy tale. Has a very positive, courageous girl character."
4,Gorgeous Words Of Wisdom,"Even though it's a kid's book, I enjoyed the King's Equal. It's a simple, beautiful story about true intelligence and wealth (the wealth of knowledge and friendship, rather than possessions taken by force). Would recommend the hardback version because it has beautiful illustrations, the short-chapter format doesn't."
2,RCA cables but only one cable,I always thought RCA cables means it comes in a pair of red and black but this ones only has one cable. Not sure what it will be used for but its totally useless to me. The photo shows two cable but I guess it means one cable with two ends.
1,Not the MST3K movie,"This is not the ""Sapce Travelers"" from Mystery Science Theater 3000. That film was a live-action American film originally released under the title ""Marooned"". MST3K has never featured anime. This is the movie you're looking for:Marooned"
3,quantity but not quality,"I read this because of a History of War class in college. Black does a remarkable job of making mention of lots of conflicts that most people have never heard of before. But he jumps around alot, mentioning some people and wars very briefly and totally out of nowhere and often jumping around a bit. If you a want a very summarized look at military history in the last 550 years, this is it. Just don't expect details or alot of coherency."
5,Perfect for Powershot S5 IS,"This is my second Tamrac brand bag, and it is perfect for Powershot S5 IS.Seems to be durable, roomy, and pockets have plenty of room for 12 AA NiMh batts, SD Cards, reader cables, and viewing screen protective film.Highly recommend this for S5 users. Don't even bother with the Canon brand S5 bag. This is the one you need."
4,Just the right size for S3 IS with adapter,"My Canon S3 IS with the conversion adapter and spare batteries and cards fits perfectly. The padding is thick and protects the camera very well.The only problem is that it is very large to be comfortable when carried on your belt, but the only way to avoid this is to change the laws of physics. I carry it in a backpack with the comfidence that the camera will not be damaged by bumping into something."
1,"Great Service, Great Price, worthless bag!","The Tamrac 5682 bag is a solidly built, dependable-looking bag. If it's anything like the other Tamrac bags that I've purchased, it will protect a camera from most normal abuse. Unfortunately, it's too small. It's billed as being ideal for a compact dSLR with a smaller-than-3"" lens (attached), but I can't get it to take my Nikon D40 with the 18-55 lens. This bag is better suited to prosumer grade toys than to a dSLR and should really say so in the description.I purchased this camera through Warehouse Deals By Amazon, and both the price and shipping were outstanding. The item literally came to me two days after I ordered it, by standard shipping. Just incredible, as was the price! Go Amazon!!"
4,Bias on Bias!,"I have found it interesting that people reviewing works bashing the Watchtower get 5 stars, if they don't agree with Watchtower views. This to me raises red flags. Of course we are all entitled to a view point and I suppose from a psychological point of view we would rate such works as high or agreeable. However, I feel the previous reviewer was grossly unfair and not a true representation of the authors work. Also, upon reviewing the reviews of the last person the pattern blatantly exposed his\her intentions."
1,If I could enter 0 stars I would have.,"I went to imdb and checked out this movie since I watched it and wanted to see what others thought.To my surprise most of the reviews here have been nearly word for word cut and pastes of the reviews on that website. The reviewer who mentioned that they must be acquiantances hit it dead on, I think, for many of the reviews.The movie sounded really cool on the box. If my expectations were a neck-deep pool, there wouldn't be a molecule of water present.This was shoddy workmanship. Poorly executed acting, scriptwriting and effects. I feel bad for anyone who's name is associated with this movie, or who, like me, wasted $3.50 renting it. I want my time and money back.Please do NOT waste your time on this movie, despite the other reviewers supporting it. You'll thank me."
1,Dork Heaven,"This is the second worst wanna-be Jacob's Ladder movie I've ever seen, the worst being ""13 Seconds"". It went through so many obvious plot contrivances that I knew how it was going to end when I was only twenty minutes in - and then I had to sit through another 70 minutes.It's unfortunate that the movie had a muddled script and a bad story because the cinematography was pretty good, and the first few minutes of the movie showed promise. I just wish that I knew why everyone is suddenly making these third-rate ""I'm dead but I don't know it"" movies. It's becoming a whole sub-genre of thriller movies now. It's probably some kind of M. Night Shyamalan backlash. One star for you."
3,Unique look at heaven and hell...,"I felt that Douglas Shulze did a fine job with a good story and interesting locations. The imagery was my favorite part of this movie. I thought that they used a fairly unique look at heaven and hell and angels. The performances were somewhat dry, but there were definite moments where the leads really stood out. Overall I enjoyed this movie, even with a few minor flaws. I do recommend checking it out!"
4,Chill Thrill,"Quality never goes out of style... or does it? The stunts are outrageous, classic ski film footage, Stumps flicks stand the test of time. Gotta love the 80's gear. Who knew you could do so much in rear entry boots w/ 215 straight boards strapped on? Makes for a fantastic background flick to run during a party, you'll either be drawn in by the sick tricks or the threads, for half the party crowd it becomes the main event."
2,DVDs,One of the DVDs were damaged in the case....very unfortunate. The other DVDs were fine.. Good for research but I wish I could get the last DVD replaced but cannot get a hold of the Producer.
1,...,"What a disappointment! (...) The ""recipes"" are all same old, same old -- nothing remotely unique or original. The only difference is that they're decorated for holidays, but I could have figured out for myself to glue on a shamrock for St. Patrick's Day, or whatever. Also, gluing wiggly eyes to a rock is not exactly a ""concoction"", nor does it require buying a book.Even the actual recipes are losers ... For example, the one for snow globes doesn't specify non-metal glitter, non-metal figures, distilled water, *OR* silicone adhesive -- all of which are essential if you want the globe to last more than a few days.The book seems to have been rushed to press with any ole crafts just to fill the pages, without regard for whether or not they'll last more than a few days -- much less whether or not they're even crafts or recipes. YUCK...."
1,Feels like it's selling something,"The video was short, of poor quality, and I felt like the narrator was selling a product the entire length. I have personally been to New Zealand (both islands), and this bluray did not do it justice at all."
4,"A good intro to Australia and NZ, but incomplete","I found the scenery breathtaking on this DVD, and Rudy Maxa's presentation professional and modest. I definitely recommend this disc, but it feels somewhat incomplete. Indeed, I have seen DVD box sets that contain more episodes of Rudy Maxa's travels down under, and they should have added a second disk or provided separate discs for the New Zealand and Australia episodes on the Blu-ray version."
3,Rudy Maxxa's Australia and New Zealand,"Photography was poor, brightly overdone. Scenic nature is nice, typical of remote lands. Rudy's previous releases such as France, Italy and London are much better made."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"A+ SELLER, ARRIVED EXTREMLY FAST IN GREAT CONDITION AND AT A VERY FAIR PRICE. WOULD LOVE DOING BUSINESS WITH AGAIN. THANK YOU SINCERELY, JODI"
3,"Good video, but not as pictured","My son enjoyed this dvd as he does ALL the Thomas ones, but in the picture they show the ""honey car"" as included with the video and ours came with Terrance instead. This may not be a big deal for everyone , but since we already have two Terrances it was a bit of a disappointment for our ""obsessed"" little Thomas fan!"
3,Armed only with Marxist theology,"This is clearly the least successful of the three Trotsky books by Deutscher. Only a theologian could enjoy the ins and outs of Marxist theory as Trotsky sought to understand why he had lost out to Stalin and whether he might regain his position. While Trotsky was indeed unarmed except for theory and theology, Stalin was armed with bureaucratic and state and party power. Stalin knew better than Trotsky how to win a fight but he also knew that Trotsky was a better Marxist and he appropriated Trotsky's program of peasant collectivization and the subjection of the working class to needed primitive socialist accumulation and rapid industrialization."
2,A big Ron Hansen fan and disappointed.,"As a big fan of Ron Hansen, I couldn't wait to get my hands on his latest novel. By page 20 I was disappointed and reeling with a sense of--OK, Get on with it! The story is slow to start, and slow to evolve, and there is no one, absolutely no one, to root for in this book. I cared nothing about Geli, which makes for hard going. As a student of history, especially the history of the Second World War, I appreciated the details Hansen dug up in his meticulous research, I just wish he had paid more attention to character development."
5,A Real Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius . . .,"Ron Hansen uses his story to take you down from all the big images of Nazi Germany to a level where you feel you can almost experience it as it is born and grows. His characterization of Hitler seesaws back and forth. One moment you think you might almost sympathize with the failed artist/dictator, but then his other side shines through and dispels your illusions. Even better is Hansen's portrayal of Angelika, Hitler's niece who is groomed to become his lover. Her repulsion/attraction to Hitler is rendered in a very believable manner.This was my first time reading Hansen, but I plan to go back for more. Hitler's Niece is clearly the work of a master."
1,No Spring time for me,I was very disappointed with this novel from the vague Geli Raubal character to the speculation about Hitlers eary days that came off very contrived and boring.
4,"The weirder the relationship, the more interesting","I'm a Ron Hansen fan, although I prefer the westerns. I was disappointed in Mariette in Ecstacy, but was pleased to find Hitler's Niece a much stronger book. (Mariette was just too darned atmospheric with too little plot or resolution for me.)One of Hansen's strengths, in my opinion, is his ability to render a convincing portrait of an environment dominated by men (probably has something to do with why I prefer the westerns). He's quite successful with Hitler and his inner circle. Hansen's Hitler, manipulative, cowardly, and vain, suited my existing point of view. I also found it oddly satisfying to see Hitler's cronies depicted as loony, dysfunctional social misfits.This story is a train wreck, of course, I knew that Geli would come to a bad end and it would be Hitler's fault, but I kept reading anyway. The weirder the relationship became, the more interested I became, and consequently, the more believable I found the story. I enjoyed it."
1,extremely disappointing,"The book claims to be a ""carefully researched historical novel,"" but it is full of historical inaccuracies. Several details truly intrigued me and proved to me how poorly the author understood the society and culture of WWII Europe. Here are some examples: Hitler's favorite food was peanut butter sandwiches (I doubt peanut butter was available at that time in Germany -- it is a rarity even today); Geli shaved her legs (this was not a custom at all); people ate food out of paper plates (paper plates were not around in Germany at that time -- I doubt they were even invented yet). Although the aforementioned comments may seem trivial, I believe they are illustrative of the rest of the book. I am extremely disappointed that the author has done such a poor job at researching the material. This book is a disgrace to Hitler."
4,The Beauty and the Beast,"A fascinating on novel on the relationship that Adolf Hitler (may have) had with his niece Geli. This book may or may not be true and that is exactly what makes it so fascinating: are we taking a look into the private life of Evil? Or is this all made up? We will never really know.What remains is an intriguing story of the development of a relationship between an optimistic, open girl/young woman and her morose uncle, who at times is utterly charming, at other times a complete fiend. This reminds me of so many other stories from daily life where you always wonder: ""Why doesn't she leave him???"""
1,"This is a joke, right?","Yet another example of how wrong historical novels can go. The only thing Hansen proved by writing this book was how little he knows about Hitler and his relationship with Geli. ""Hitler's Niece"" is superficially ""researched"", scattered throughout with rumors, plus the quotes he took from Kubizek and Hitler himself were, for the most part, either taken out of context or completely fictional. He also, to top it all off, had the audacity to claim that Hitler (the character) did, in actuality, murder his niece. Facts support the theory that Angelika was, indeed, murdered-- either by members of Hitler's own Party or those of a rival organisation. However, to presume that Adolf Hitler was the perpetrator is a clear sign of a gross lack of information on Hansen's part.The author would be well advised to stick to subjects with which he is better acquainted in future."
3,Hitler's Niece,"Most likely because I have such an aversion to the man in the title I found this book compelling enough to finish but in many ways I wish I had not started it. It has always been curious to me how Hitler got such a firm hold on the German population. To some degree, this book helped me understand the reasons for his success. I have been told by someone who watched and listened to his speeches that his eyes were spellbinding. This novel would validate that statement."
3,Hitler's Niece,"Reference the book, I found it fascinating. An interesting, if fictional, account of the ""goings on"" in Hitler's family circle.Reference the audio, I was so looking forward to hearing this after reading the book but was gravely disappointing. I felt Janet McTeer's reading was ""harsh and difficult to listen too"" undoubtedly the result of a desire to create the ""Hitler hysteria"" of voice (like fingernails on a blackboard) which we have seen in newsreels, etc. I couldn't get through it."
1,Unvelievably bad. Is this the same Ron Hansen!?,Pathetic and ridiculous politically corrected salacious total nonsense. Can this be the same Ron Hansen who wrote the great *Assassination of Jesse James...* book!?
1,I was freaked out !,"I just finished reading HITLER'S NEICE and I have to say that this book creeps me out!! At first, when I borrowed this I thought I could see how Hitler was really like and try to understand how he came into all of this, on a deeper level. But after reading this, I was scared out of my mind. Hitler is pure crazy!! Especially what he forces Geli to do and changes the people around him into more sinister things.HITLER'S NEICE really supports what the textbooks say about him except that this book shows his childish side. In a way, society made him into who he was because he could have been an artist. But because of his passionate nature for the Germans, it might have warped him or maybe he was warp to begin with. But to begin with, there really wasn't much goodness inside of him. He was a sulky, childish, selfish, self-cetered, opportunist brat! And I hope that no one would EVER turn out to be like him because it is tooo evil."
3,Fascinating Fiction From Truth,"Hitler and his niece, Angelika ''Geli'' Raubal, were living in the same Munich house when she was killed by a bullet fired from his pistol in September 1931. Geli, a lively, witty young woman, was no Nazi and had been restive under Hitler's increasingly domineering obsession with her.After her death, ruled a suicide, he said she had been the only woman he would ever love. Was there a sexual relationship? Was Geli actually murdered because the affair, if made public, would have derailed his rise to power? In Hitler's Niece, a fact-based novel, Hansen's attempt to solve the mystery approaches melodrama. But the incidental detail accumulates into a brilliant, chilling account of the way psychological deformity and historical chance propelled Hitler and his confederates toward triumph."
4,Great read,I really enjoyed this book I would have liked for it to be longer but it was still good easy to read.
2,Treading dangerous ground,"I like historical novels in general, but this one was a turnoff. Enough is known about the evils of Hitler that I don't think we really need to have speculation made on his sexual proclivities. Yes, the guy is a nominee for Creep of All Time, but I don't believe that portraying him as a neurotic, cowardly pervert accomplishes anything. Let him be reviled in history for the terrible things he was responsible for. But let's not create a legend, good or bad, about the man. This, in my opinion, is as bad as those that write about the Holocaust never existing.The two stars it gets are for the carefully researched historical background, and the origins and endings of his chief henchmen. But this stuff can also be found in a lot of other books."
1,Fair,"I expected when reading this book to learn a great deal about Hitler and his dealings with not only his cronies but his family. This book reminds me of Truman Capote ""In Cold Blood"". Without a doubt, many of things Hansen writes about took place but I think he took some liberties in terms of dialogue and events. It was hard to determine what was real and what was made up. Through this book, you definitely feel how dominant Hitler was over the people he came in contact with, but you have no real understanding as to why Hitlers niece stuck around."
3,weird...,"I read this book with amusement and disgust up until the horrifying and tragic ending. The author has presented the Hitler we feel we know and love: a perverted little scumbag, and finally a murderer. I understood why Geli stayed...she was like a beautiful butterfly pinned to a board by a greedy, drooling collector.Charlie Chaplin did a great job making Hitler look like the buffoon that he ultimately was; so has Hansen. It was haunting, but not a pretty picture. I honestly couldn't recommend it to anyone planning to eat dinner any time soon."
2,Reads like nonfiction.,"I've loved Hansen's work in the past, but this book didn't touch me at all. I finally ended up reading it just for the apparently well-researched facts about Hitler. There are also several oddities where Hansen uses contemporary language in the 1930s time period--rather jarring."
5,Johnny Hodges Collates V.2,"Everything I said in my review on Johnny Hodges Collates V.1 applies to this CD as well. In addition to an imperious Hodges on alto and Lawrence Brown on trombone there are BEN WEBSTER and FLIP PHILLIPS on tenor sax. These recordings were all made in 1951 and 1952 but swing as much now as they did then.If you do not yet know Johnny Hodges' work buy this CD AND Johnny Hodges Collates V.1 and start now. If you do, you will want this all the more.Just a detail on the track listings no.5 should read 'BELOW the Azores' and no.7 'WHAT'S I'm GOTCHERE'."
2,Picture are blurry.,I purchased this binoculars with camera because i wanted to take pictures of a person a block away. So i started taking pictures of street signs and stop signs half a block away and you cannot even see the white letters from the red stop sign. They are cheap binoculars though but the camera on there is useless.
4,Fun binoculars/camera,I love these. I can't always carry my camera but there is always something too far away to see well. This binocular/camera combo fills the bill. This camera takes good action photos on the fly. Usually when I'm following my husbands motorcycle stunts with a camera I just get photos of his dust. With the binocular/camera I can follow him better and take a decent photo. Doesn't do well in low light situations. I don't care about taking pictures in the dark so I'm happy with this binocular/camera. Batteries don't last long so put in for a good supply.
3,for children,"this item is good for a child, not a professional. please be care in labeling products so they are better suited for the end user"
2,Bushnell Binocular w/VGA Camera,"The Good: Great price, Small size is great for hiking, travel & concerts. Takes fairly good pictures & software is easy to use.The Bad: Having to hold the binoculars very steady for a good focused picture, which is very hard to do. Take extra batteries, they don't last long."
4,Vale su precio.,Lo compré a modo de prueba y me siento satisfecho con la compra. Las fotos tomadas hasta ahora las considero de buena calidad. Sirve para captar momentos a distancia que de otra forma la cámara normal no daría el tiempo para capturar esos momentos.
4,Great for Concerts,I used these binoculars/camera for the first time at a Bonnie Raitt concert at Red Rocks (Colorado) and they worked great. It was easy to see the performers and take photos (even if they don't allow photos; there is no flash so no one knows!).
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THEM!!","These are the cutest shoes EVER! They're the perfect mix of dainty and ""hot."" I absolutely adore them. While they fit a little on the smaller side, they make your feet look so tiny and cute. Just the perfect shoe to boost your confident and complement your outfit... you'll look (and feel) cute and amazing."
5,Love em!,"These are great shoes, like any 3 3/4 inch heel, it takes a few wears to break them in. Everyone loves them, and the match everything. I agree with product suggestions, purchase 1/2 size bigger and they will fit perfect!"
2,Hate them,Not comfortable at all! Way too narrow for us girls with wider feet. Also the one time I did wear them the sole came off! They are in the box in the back of my closet and will stay there.
4,Love them!,"I love these shoes, they are my second pair from Jessica's Line. They hurt a little but Beauty is Pain! Way Cute!!"
5,Very cute shoe-,"Much more confortable than I thought, and i'm used to wearing pumps every day. They may run a little snug, so if you're going to wear w/out hose, you might go up a half size. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
1,wide feet?,"This shoe is not for people with wide feet. The side of my foot stuck out of the shoe, not flattering at all. I wish the shoe came in a wide size because it is really cute."
5,Still great after 10 years,My wife bought this album 10 years ago. She has always been a Karla Bonoff fan. This album is wonderful. I still love it.You should try it. You won't be sorry.
5,Another pocket treasure,"If you are interested in American Quakers, this little book is a good place to begin your studies! Truly a pocket sized book, you can carry this with you everywhere. It is not the whole of John Woolman's journal, just some very good excerpts about this 18th century Quaker mystic and abolitionist who was strongly against slavery when other Friends had few objections.Once you've read this, you may want to try his full sized Journal. This is a good book for beginners, for young people and for those who admire John Woolman but may not like to read a lot!"
2,meh,"Not really effective... I was told it makes skin fall off, no such effect on warts. Resorted to self surgery."
5,outstanding,"Optimistic, encouraging, hopeful, inspiring. These are the words that better describe this collection. Arturo Benavides' one and only voice creates the magic!!!"
2,Good but not excellent,"I think the book is really good for the people who doesn't know the work of Piano, but in my case it was - in certain way - disappointing. The pictures wasn't new, i already knew the most of them. A lot of sketches but few drawings, details or thoughts about Piano's work. The book could be excellent but it is just good."
3,Harsh Opinions,"This is a good book to read - it is driven by valiant goals and a love of one's people, but just know that you're dealing with some serious people here. If you're black and you're dating a white person, they feel the best plan of action is to ostracize you to set an example for the young.Ouch."
1,Black?... Do you mean African?,This is a strange urban Black American perspective that ignores the rest of the world and concerns itself with a very Amero centric view that has no value for the larger world. It's a book written by cultists .... if they offer you a homemade drink .. skip it.I read half the book couldn't take anymore.Sad.
1,These are disposable - more trash for the landfills,"The information presented about this product neglects to tell you that these things cannot be re-charged. After you us the power boost for ""up to 60 minutes"" you throw the thing out. I guess that's what they mean by ""convenient"". When I followed the link for ""technical information"", there was absolutely no information displayed.I suspect savvy buyers of cell phone accessories might say, ""of course they are disposable!"" But I am the average busy person who is used to getting all the information I need from Amazon to make an informed buying choice in less than 10 minutes. I usually don't have to search other web sites for consumer information.This product has been misrepresented when compared to other products I have purchased from Amazon's 3rd party vendors."
3,Ok for the price,Bought these to add some light to my little patio. The lights are reasonable well made and except for one broken light bulb everything worked as should.The lights are a bit smaller in real life then I expected but using two sets I can at least cover a wall about 6 yards long which gives a pleasant ambient light.I plan to keep them outdoor at all times because I can not be bothered to take them down each time. We'll see how they fare during the wetter the San Francisco winter. I suspect they don't last more than a year but considering the price that is ok with me.
3,Witch's Night Out,"Terrific music!! Really interesting animation--not the stuff on the box!!! Fine story. However, the producers of this video elected to sell it in SLP rather than SP, probably to save a few pennies. Ergo, if you are looking for a high quality picture, you will not find it in this product!"
2,predictable,"sometimes corny, lacks depth. unrealistic both before robert became famous and afterward. very light read if you want to pass mindless time. i do not think that this book is the answer for self-reflection. there are better books out there (Mitch Albom) for that."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I actually started this book thinking that it wouldn't be that great. I had to read it for a book club. I was pleasantly surprised and have already checked the library for the other books that Evans has written.Read it and you will also be pleasantly surprised, too!"
1,One of the worst I've ever read,"The saying goes that ""there's nothing new under the sun"", and this book proves it! Just another overly sentimental story that's been told a million times by much better writers than Richard Paul Evans. Technically, the book is not well written - more on a junior high school level, and repetitive phraseology made for a boring read. The story was sappy, the climax contrived. Character development was lacking, as was motivation for many of Robert's decisions & subsequent actions. The only semi-interesting aspect of the book was the description of an author's book tour. Maybe Evans should end his own book tours to spend more time writing a really good story."
3,Good book,Good book. Kind of slow moving. I don't like it as well as other books I have read by this author.
2,Terrible,"This entire novel is a non-sequitur. Don't let the prologue suck you in, the rest doesn't make sense. A happy novel? Hardly. For the middle 3/4 it was predictably full of despair and the underlying anger was cliche. And the overall premise--that a perfect marriage can change so quickly--is ridiculous. Neither Rob nor Allison behaved close to what one might consider realistic. Evans sets them up as the ideal loving couple, but then shows them both to be selfish and egotistical. Ugly. There is no depth, just attempted manipulation of the reader's emotions. The irony is that it is not emotional because, knowing the formula, most of the novel was spent waiting for the obvious. I found myself skipping passages but didn't miss a beat."
1,"Very cheesy, predictable, mindless read","I was very interested to read a book from this author as I have never read anything before and saw a few very good reviews. I was so dissappointed when I actually started reading this book. It is SO predictable, and SO mindless. It is so easy to read and requires so little attention that it is a great book when you don't have the time to actually sit down and concentrate on a good book. I only actually finished it because I just had to see how it ended. Of course, it ended exactly as you think it would. No surprises."
2,One of the worst books I've read this year,"This book was borderline horrible...it was a constant effort of a Hallmark Moment. Full of cheesy unrealistic dialogue, predictable events, cliche'd happenings. Towards the end I just started skimming because I knew what it was all leading up to.It strives to be some groundbreaking story of depth, but it's just a repeat of what's been done 1000's of times before. The book gets so cheesy sometimes I was laughing at the moments intended to hit a person in the heart."
4,Perfect day,"This was a good book. Not my favorite of Richard Paul Evans though. I really like the Walk series. I do recommend it, this book and the Walk"
1,Predictable and boring,"This book was awful!!! Does this man even know how to write? I can't believe the positive reviews that this book is generating. First of all it's so predictable: when Robert first finishes his novel his wife pleads with him not to leave her when he becomes successful; his publisher tells him that he and his wife have a special relationship and that she doesn't want to see anything get in the way of that....and guess what? Anyone not see this coming? He leaves his wife!!! Gee I never would have guessed it!! The author is clearly drawing on his own life. He makes the writer in this book sound like he's a rock star!!! An author's life isn't THAT exciting people!!! And the ""twist"" if you can even call it that was so dumb!!! Please I beg you DO NOT waste your time reading this drivel. Spend your time reading someone who actually knows how to write."
3,Ok but whats with the wife??,Not a bad read but tell the wife to grow up! And who gets a new puppy but then leaves it alone for the night??
1,Dissapointing,"This book was one of the best books that I have ever read, until the last 10 pages. Really upseting!"
2,Wrong Narrator,"Perhaps this story is better than I give it credit. This narrator is whiney, goofy, annoying, does horrible female voices and in places appears not to have pre-read the context of what he's reading. I will start over with a hard copy, but if you're thinking of purchasing the audiobook, don't do it!"
4,Good Read,My first book by Richard Evans. A great lesson - money and fame are most always NOT the answer to the happiness and security we desire.
4,"Another winner by Richard Paul Evans, in my book.","Liked the storyline, and it reads quickly as do all of his books. I will recommend it to friends of mine."
4,Serves its Purpose,"We bought this for Halloween for our little boy. It held up well for a long day of Halloween festivities. He wears 12 month clothes and it fit him fine over long pants and a sweatshirt. The hat was small, though."
2,Ok costume,I think it's pretty cute but the hat is way to small for my baby's head. My kiddo has an average head almost small. The elastic around the arm was broken but the new one was fine.
1,Over priced and over rated!!!!!,"I just finished the program, and it was not what it was cracked up to be. First of all, I had to print out all of the readings; I couldn't even view it on the computer before printing.There are only five exercises and with the SAME five readings.It wouldn't help me to reread the same exercises because I would only memorize it by reading it so much. The only way to figure out if I am improving is to choose my own reading material, number the words, and time it. I HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT MYSELF. It also would have been nice to check the level of comprehension after the readings. I don't see a need to use this Cd Rom more than once. I choose this one because of the excellent ratings from amazon customers. I should have known better because it was only 7 reviews. Very disappointed!!!"
5,Surprised at how easy it was to increase my reading speed!,"I sat down at the computer yesterday and gave it a try. I had no idea what to expect and was really surprised at how easy it was to increase my reading speed! I really raced through the cd and even as quickly as I went my reading speed went up from 243 wpm to 414! I am sure if I spent just a little more time with it I would really benefit from your innovative techniques. This is the perfect cd for busy people who want to read more rapidly and more effectively. The production quality is also first-rate - crisp, clean graphics and easy-to-follow directions make this a breeze to use.I am sure our patrons will benefit from ""Rev it up Reading.""Susan SmaydaHead of Community ServicesWallingford Public Library"
4,Get Going,This is a simple way to increase your reading speed. Within twenty minutes I had more than doubled my speed. The draw back to speed reading for me; I always feel hurried and I have not mastered the retention section. So I've read it all but I still don't remember it all.
5,Many people know Wells wrote great full length novels...,"but few remember his classic short stories. 'The Empire Of The Ants' is one short story with a huge impact, even being made into a sci-fi B-movie. Ants in South America has always been part of the landscape, from leaf-cutter ants to army ants, they are part of daily life. But what happens when the ants come and refuse to leave?Other stories in this tiny collection are 'The Man Who Could Work Miracles' which was also a movie, 'The Country Of The Blind' which proves that sight is NOT an advantage, 'The Crystal Egg' which is a must for any War of the Worlds' fan and 'The Magic Shop', a very weird short story.A must for any fan of H.G. Wells or for anybody who loves 'The War Of The Worlds'."
3,Good over evil,"The books is a rip roaring adventure from beginning to end.I suppose that the reason that I can't give it high marks is that isn't isn't very original even with new creature at the beginning ( Gnolls?).Evil priests of evil gods and bad wizards fighting good wizards. Elfs and troll and other mythical being fighting it out with knights and yeomen.With the traditional fantasy map at the first pagewe have a small band of ""The Alliance"" facing the hoardsof demons, bugbears, trolls and reanimated bodies.Nice if you like that sort of spell casting and sword fighting."
1,Only Good For Nostalgia,"In my opinion, the only value I got out of this book was the nostalgia of ""old D&D"". If it was a non-gaming related product, I would have put it down after the first chapter or two and never picked it back up.As others have pointed out, the characters are more wooden than anything else, and the way they bond immediately is unbelievable and just short of gagging.If you want old D&D, read the module itself. It's bound to be more inspired than this book was. And this is from someone who was really looking forward to this book, and therefore gave it every chance before deciding against it."
3,"I liked it, but it wasn't the best book I've ever read","I picked up this book after having played the game more times than I can count (mostly running it). There are several things I really enjoyed about the book, but others that made me feel a little disappointed.The good:1: It was great getting a refresher in the structure of the temple, and it brought back a lot of memories. It also gave me some interesting ideas.2: It was not written in the typical preteen fashion that many books derivative of the games are.3: It was entertaining.The Bad:1: Not the greatest character development -- it seemed a bit rushed.2: Anyone who's played the game will recognize that this went entirely too easy and quickly to even compare.3: A bit too many stereotypical elements.All in all, if you love the game, you will enjoy the book. If you are just looking for a good fantasy novel, try Tolkein or Alexander."
2,Dull D&D Adventure Novel,"There were elements of this novel that could have made a good story but on the whole it was very dry and boring. The prologue was too short. In the span of a hundred pages the main characters go from hardly knowing eachother to being best friends. There is no interesting interaction between them.The vilians are equally drab. So drab that not even tired old vilian cliches can be attatched to them. They are underdeveloped and you dont believe their motivations. Hedrach seems kind of intriguing at the beginning but as the story develops his intrigue quickly diminishes.The only reason this book deserves two stars instead of one is that avid gamers will recognize certain familiar elements. Many spells used, and dieties named, and secret doors found will ring bells.If you want to read a better book set in the Greyhawk campaign world read some of Paul Kidd's novels they are well written and have more interesting characters."
2,Reads like Dungeon Master Notes.,"When I was twelve I would have given this book 4 stars. A few years more of reading has changed that. Simply put, this novel is like reading the outline to the game module. It is very shallow with no character development. Within two days time in the novel (12 pages) a group of ""Adventurers"" whom have never met are putting their lives on the line to save each other from disaster and death. It will make you shake your head a couple of times. This book would have been a good outline concept for a novel. The upside? Its better than TV these days and more quiet and it reads fast. If you must have value for your reading dollar, skip this one, read the module and play it."
3,"good, but nothing spectacular","It was a good read, but nothing spectacular. It kept my interest enough that i wanted to finish reading the entire book. I'm interested to go look back at ""The Temple Of Elemental Evil"" module now, as well, and perhaps try playing that one again. This isn't a book i'd rush out to buy, though. Borrow it from a friend or library, read it, and return it. If you're looking for a keeper to read over and over again, try some books by Paul Kidd in the ""Descent Into The Depths Of The Earth"" series. Those are definite keepers!!!:>"
1,The Temple of Elemental Evil,"WOW! I have read some some bad books folks but this takes the cake. The plot is the most stereotypical I have ever seen. It is as if the author has never read another fantasy book in his life and is trying to write the first one. There are no new ideas or concepts anywhere. These days fantasy books must bring something new to the table. The characters have a very bland and lifeless feel to them. I actually had no feelings at all when any of them died, I just kept checking the page numbers counting down to the finish. If you are new to the fantasy genre treat yourself to a Margret Weis and Tracey Hickman novel, don't waste precious fantasy goodness reading time on these pages of pain."
2,Northpoint,"If your into the pointed look, this is the bra to order! I didn't care for the shape as I prefer my chest to be rounded."
5,Best Fitting Bra Ever!,"This bra is the best fitting bra I have ever had. I have three of this style of bra because the first one fit so well. Not only is it the best fitting bra, but it is also very sexy with displaying some cleavage. It fits and is sexy. . .all in the same bra! With other bras, I always felt like my boobs were going to fall out. Not with this bra! Sexy and comfortable! Who could ask for anything more? Perfect bra!!!!!"
5,Excellent product for price,This bra fits well and does not bind. I can easily do gardening or other strenuous work without worrying about eposistioning my bra. It holds up well to multiple washings ( delicate machine and air dry is best). I have purchased this product for several years and have been pleased with it repeatedly. I have had difficulty finding other bras in the same size that would fit.
2,Underwires break thru fabric quickly ruining bra,"this bra is absolutely fantastic (fit, lift, shape, smooth, great straps for D+, thickness of padding, comfortable, except COMPLETELY USELESS very quickly when the underwires break through the fabric. I unfortunately love the other qualities & I've worn these for years & years & they still don't make them well enough to last a while. Beware u will have to re-purchase often! (Most last only 3 to 5 months.) I have just found the same EXACT same bra under different name at a huge discount store I'd rather not to shop in :~) look there & save money on replacements!"
3,Squeaky,"This bra is all right. It has nice wide straps, but the rings and such are all plastic. The fabric makes a squeaking noise when I move - because it is sliding over the plastic rings and underwire, I assume. The padding is nice, but I don't like the polyester fabric."
3,Squeaky but good support,"For some reason, this bra squeaks. All the time, whenever I move. No one else seems to have noticed but I do. Why am still wearing said squeaking bra? because it's comfortable & it looks good. oh well."
1,Not a good Company to buy from....,"Do not purchase from this Company. Unless you don't care if you don't get your shipping charges refunded back on a return. I returned my products, and I paid for my shipping, and they still deducted it from credit. Never again, will I purchase from this company."
2,The cups wrinkle,"This bra fits me properly, and I am fastidious about how I wash and store my lingere. Still, the cups gave up their sleekness and I can't wear it with a t-shirt or other close-fitting tops."
5,Every American Should Read This Book,Voices From the Front is an excellent book to give insight to those who aren't involved in the military and give support to those who are. My husband is in the Air Force and actually has some of his letters published in the book. Three months after his tour in Korea he got sent to Iraq and will be there until January. Though is was difficult to read some of the letters in the book it was also encouraging to know that I am not alone in this situation. I am proud that my husband is serving his country even if it means we have to be apart. I wish that every American would read this book to help them remember that our freedom and the freedom of others comes with a price. Thank you Frank Schaeffer for all your hard work and giving voices to our military men and women and their families.
3,Pomegrante Seeds,"The pomegrante seeds arrived on time, pretty good price and fast service. I was surprised the seeds were all stuck together, so i wasn't happy about that.....good to put in smoother."
2,pomegranate seeds,"I the price and shipping was good. I never tried pomegranate seeds before. I didn't like them, they are very sour."
1,time limit = CRAP!!!!,DO NOT BUY TAKES TOO LONG TO AIM YOU WILL LOSE WAY TOO EASYYOU WILL WIN TOO EASY TOO. JUST BUY SECOND SIGHT OR THE SIMSDONT BUY THIS!!!!!!
3,"Sometimes yes, sometimes no","This 3 tracks cd single is a piece only for collectors or fans that could die for Depeche Mode any time. The first mix is perfect if you want to make any kind of work out on your spinning machine, it could be very boring for many people, thank God it only last a few minutes!!!, but is a good one, but the lyrics were missed, you can hear only ""I've been a martyr for love"" over and over and over again. The second one is horrible!!!!, forget it!!, and Never let me down again (digitalism) reminds me Kraftwerk, it's interesting but very very very strange. Any way!!!!, enjoy it!!"
5,Hope of Earth,This is a wonderful book based on the experiences of the pioneers of Illinois during the 1830's and 1840's. The Father's legacy to his son is memorable.
4,Very nicely done,"One of the better done travel videos I have seen. It does not go into where to shop, where to eat, etc., if that is what you are looking for. A little dated but certainly made me want to visit Wales. The photography was probably the outstanding part of the video."
3,not complete,"This book is gorgeous. But I was disappointed that the recipes weren't complete. Many of them tell you to use a certain type of salsa, but there are no salsa recipes in the book. I can think of at least three salsas, offhand, that are used in the recipes. Because I don't know salsas very well, I don't know what to use for what they call for in the recipe. I was hoping to learn how to make fresh and cooked salsas; because of this, I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends."
2,Not really for dummies!,"I found this book in the library and thought it would be a great resource for learning to make some of the Mexican foods I love. For example, the tamales and tortillas available in grocery stores are okay, but homemade ones are so much better.While the recipes in this book seem fine, there are no pictures, diagrams, or illustrations of the techniques used. There are some lovely photos of finished dishes, but I need to see illustrations of some of the steps involved. Many people are visual learners, but this book gives only written instructions. I expected more from a book in the ""Dummies"" series.If you just want some good recipes, this book will suit you. However, if you need more information, look for another cookbook or search the internet. I'm glad I only borrowed this one."
3,mexican ole`,"not enough real mexican recipes. BUT, i learned how to create a good rice, good basic frijoles, and a soup or two. tooooo simplistic however. it will offer a suggestion as to a side dish or a garnish but no mention of how to prep same. *shrug* ok but surely not great. i came into it with some mex food know-how also so perhaps that flavors my review. pun thoroughly intended!!"
4,Solid Figure,My son is enjoying this action figure. He has a book with most of the star wars figures listed and this is one that he has wanted for awhile. I don't know if it's worth as much money as it's selling for unless you are a collector. We are actually playing with the action figure.
3,ok film,the dvd was. interesting one I've. seen better. but. I've. seem a lot. worse. a nice. change. from your. every. day. films
3,works ok but very good,"the adhesive does not work at all, you need to use additional adhesivefor the price may be ok but not a very good product"
3,I dont know,"Its great that its a Samarai game, not very many of those come around. It didnt take me long to get bored of it though. It doesnt take very long to get to any of the multiple endings."
1,So upset,"What a let down. The first version of this game was great. I so wanted the second version to just pick up where the 1st left off. It didn't.Sure, it looks better. There are even more choices that can be made. Unfortunately... this game just sucks. And I LOVED THE 1st ONE! I don't know how they could screw it up so bad.Buyer beware."
1,I am a sucker for buying this!!!,"This game was full of boring dialogue and unrealistic swordplay. The first one had great scenery and realistic looking fights. If you must play it, rent it."
4,Expiry date for this?,How can I know an expiry date for this Jams?I couldn't find a date in any bottle.Please let me know an expiry date.
5,Shan Bombay Best for Chicken Biryani,"Shan products are the best, but this is the best of the best if you want to make a tasty chicken biryani. I think it's better than any of the other boxed biryani seasonings. What makes this spice mix better than the others? I think it's the dried plums, plus the mix of brown and green cardamoms. But there are so many good flavors in this! You just have to try it yourself and decide what you like best.I must agree with another review that you can find this much cheaper at an Indian grocery store. But some of us have no ready access to such a store. In that case, it might be worth the extra cost to have it delivered to your home."
4,Blimpish space pirates & interstellar cooking competitions,"Ever since my grade-school days, I've been a follower of Daniel Pinkwater's 'Magic Moscow' books. `Slaves of Spiegel', the third and (so far) last book in the saga of Hoboken's most unusual fast-food joint, contains more than its fair share of that trademark droll weirdness and strange culinary combinations that I've come to expect from the 'Magic Moscow' series as well as most of Pinkwater's other books geared towards grade-school children and adults who enjoy a nice, whimsical light read. Fair warning, though: some may find the book's somewhat un-PC portrayal of fat people less than savory. Personally, I think it really adds some good fun to the story.Before you decide to dive into this particular adventure, however, I recommend you bone up on some of the backstory behind this book first, including `The Magic Moscow', `Attila the Pun', and `Fat men From Space'. Happy reading!`Late"
5,TOTALY GREAT BOOK!!!!!! GOT TO HAVE,"Any Hanson fan should get this, like me! And if Taylor is your favorite Hanson brother and you think he is MMMcute then this is the book for you! It gives alot of info. and great pictures. Hey that's why I bought it!! You can't go wrong."
5,the best tay book i ever read,"this book is great it gives you every detail from what they did when they were little to what type of underwear he wears! i'm serious. here are a few facts that are in the book. his toothbrush color is aqua. he preafers the shampoo ""flex"" over hotel shampoo. I will NOT tell you what underwear he user boxers or brefs.so read the book"
5,Totally Taylor Rules,"Hey,my name is Jordan and I think even if you just like their songs you should get this! I've been a Hanson fanatic since MMMbop! :)"
2,unreadable,"What could be more entertaining than a book about fast-food? What could be more fun than reading the history of Wendy's and Long john Silver, of hamburgers and hotdogs? Unfortunately the writers of 'Fast food' have a very bad case of sociologist's jargon. Most of the book is as exciting and as readable as a management study and many a paragraph goes beyond the comprehension of this reader, even though he graduated in literature. Moreover the writers do not bother to hide their cultured disdain for the food they write about. So notwithstanding the many interesting facts and observations in this book, in the end there is very little to enjoy."
2,"More on Douglas Bader, callsign Dogsbody","Try to find Reach For The Sky, the original Bader biography. Then try to get a copy of the movie of the same name. Ditto the movie Battle of Britain because this was an extraordinary man and time and it will be worth the effort.But don't think you'll get to know him in this book, even though it contains a few new and memorable anecdotes. Such as, the actor Robert Shaw (remember him in Jaws?)was playing a character purportedly modelled on the famous fighter pilot Sailor Malan in the movie BoB and Bader told him ""Sailor was much better looking."" That rings true for the Bader character I had come to know and understand and I suspect there was a twinkle in his eye when he said it. After all, who can resist shooting down a movie star. Twinkle, twinkle.R.I.P. Dogsbody. You were my hero back in the day and that hasn't changed"
4,One person's junk...,"My mom sent me this book over the summer with a bunch of other items from home. I started to read it and fell in love with it, it was perfect for me and I related to it so well. I asked her what compelled her to buy it for me and it turns out, she got it as a white elephant gift at work. She had no idea what it was about, and just threw it in a box with a few of my old prom dresses and a copy of Seabiscut (which I will never touch). This book is retrospective, smart, sarcastic, witty and perfect for every girl who is not always as together as they seem. She tapped right into what makes me tick and I LOVE this book."
3,Very funny,"This book was a great, quick read. It would be great for hanging out on the beach. Getting over Jack Wagner is a fun book!"
4,I love the 80's-lets hope there's a strike back,"The book is clever I must say. I loved the way the author told the story. It hits so close to home for me, because I love rockstars myself. But don't be fooled and think its a love story because its more of ""finding yourself"" type book. I do hope there is a second because the first leaves you hanging in a way. I did love it, and I loved that it was centered around good rock bands and hit songs. Its worth the money I think, or at least borrow it from a close friend."
3,Loving Juska all the more!,"I read this book after I read Juska's second book 'Hazards of Sleeping Alone' and this book cemented my love of the author. Her style is witty and easy to read but fresh enough to keep me rolling the whole book through. However I was moved by some of the flashback stuff. Eliza's eighties references were a welcome addittion to the pretty hysterical anectodes about the evolution of her love life. But ultimately this book is about Eliza's relationship with her family and her father and how important it is to deal with that stuff, even as an adult. I didn't love this book as much as 'Hazards' but that would probably be impossible because 'Hazards' is my fave, but it was a great read and definitely one that I would reccomend!!!!"
3,"good story, very funny","I really like this book. It was funny, well-written and had alot of pop culture references that really enhanced the story. asa former dater of musicians and a huge fan of all things 80's, I could relate to the character. My only real problem was when the author states in the book that ""The Search Is Over"" is a song by the band Foreigner. ""The Search Is Over"" was, of course, recorded by the group Survivor. Other than that, I found the story charming and anxiously await Elise Juska's next novel."
2,"Great idea, sometimes funny, but mostly boring","I had a very hard time getting through this book without falling asleep. I was so bored by it that it was like a chore just to finish it. It has no real plot and it just drags. The characters are forgettable and at times even annoying. It's not one of those books where you feel for any of them. The best part about the book is the 80s references and there are some funny lines that all children of the 80s will appreciate. I thought the idea of the book was great, but the end result was dull."
3,I really give it 2.5 stars,"I really wanted to love this book. The title drew me in immediately. I, too, loved Jack Wagner in the 1980's. (Actually, I still think he's pretty hot and I love his singing voice.) But this book just didn't do it for me. I love a book with a good love story and, ideally, lots of laughs. Sure, there were some funny parts, but I never really laughed out loud. I was amused by Eliza's tales of her ""rock star"" boyfriends from her high school days. But there was no real romance in the story. I thought Andrew was good for Eliza and was rooting for them to get together. Call me shallow, but I like a nice, happy ending. There was no closure to this book. I see most reviewers really liked it, but I give it 2.5 stars and can't really recommend it."
3,"The 80's references were great, but that was about all","I am a really big fan of the Eighties, And when I saw a book called 'Getting Over Jack Wagner"" I had to read it. Elise Juska the story of Eliza, a twenty-six year old who has one dating rule. Date only rock stars, even if they are not famous yet. This book is just giving the reader a look at some of Eliza's date and the friends around her. But over all this is not one of Downtown Press better books. If you are a fan of the eighties then you will enjoy all of the pop culture references but that is about all."
1,SUCKS....DON'T BOTHER,"Not only is this book boring, but there doesn't seem to be much of a point. If i want a reflection of a bad childhood, I can reflect upon my own. I would not recommend purchasing this book unless you can get paid to read it. And, may I ask...where exactly were the 90s in all of this? I have to admit I read this book fast...but it wasn't because I liked it, but that I wanted to get to a different book...and quick!!! And one last note...the ending sucked. This is Elise's first book, and hopefully the last."
4,Excellent book. A real must read.,"Crisp, witty, incisive and fun. This book has all the entertainment value of Bridget Jones, but with more meat on its literary bones if not on its heroine. We've all been where Eliza is in this book -- looking at our lives and wondering where we'll end up and realizing there are no guarantees we'll get what we want. I related to her and I'm long past twenty-six."
5,Not just for girls...,"Too bad this book has been labeled Chick Lit. It simply does not do it justice. Anyone who ever had a lusty teenage / young adult crush will love this book. Especially those of us who grew up in the 70s and 80s when TV meant everything. But more importantly, anyone who loves real characters dealing with relevant issues of identity, love, and your own place in the world will love this book. Juska has a command of pop culture and a hip factor that is simply unrivaled among today's young, new writers. Her command of dialogue is terrific, giving real voice to her characters.And by the way, I'm not sure what planet Alexis Leya is from, but her review on this page is so off base it makes one think she has some strange ulterior motive. And if she is trying to prove she is smarter than anyone else... try spell check dear - and quotation marks are to be used when you actually quote something. Did you check the box that says you are over 13? Then uncheck it."
3,Almost There,"I wanted to love this book so much, and I mostly do. I was immediately captivated by the title of the book as I too loved Jack Wagner. I enjoyed the concept of the book with the listening soundtrack listed on each chapter. Without giving too much away, I felt uneasy about the subplot of the mother daughter relationship. This book was exactly what I was looking for with the exception of the last 2-3 pages. It was just not the ending that I was hoping for or expecting."
5,pricing?,can anyone tell me how a book like this one rockets in price over 1 month from $125 to $287
2,"OK for kids, painful for adults","If your child loves trains (like my son) he/she will probably enjoy this video. But I warn you, hide in another room until it is over. The music is hideous. They even have kids whistling. It drives me nuts. I just hope my son doesn't start. I have seen other train movies like There Goes a Train that are much easier to watch."
2,looking forward to get it,"Don't have it yet, have enjoyed the other books in the series. hope to get it soon? The price was fair."
1,Jailene sos unica,"Jailene mesmerised me they day I saw here on the cover of the CD. I bought it in early 98 in London. I haven't opened it yet. She still looks as great as she looked on the first day. I will keep it wrapped under the celophane cover forever! Incidentally, does anybody knows how I can get in contact with her?Jailene me hipnotizo el dia que la vi en la tapa de su CD. Lo compre a principios de 98 y aun no lo he abierto. Todavia luce tan resplandeciente como el primer dia que la vi. La guardare cubierta en el celofan brillante que la rodea. A proposito. Alguien sabe como contactarme con ella?Pablo ricotipo@hotmail.com"
5,Best thing I've used for my skin,"I love these and have been using them for many years. My skin has mildly broken out since I was a teenager...once I found these I noticed a huge difference in my skin, very rarely does it break out. I use one before bed every night and in the morning if I'm not showering immediately. They have a pleasant, mild scent and leave my skin feeling great!"
4,I like it,"This is a real good dvd but there missing some vidoes like look into my eyez,if I can teach the world there missing the weed song as fear as mo thugs videos there just missen it's all good as fere solo's there on point with layzie but off with krayzie,bizzy there missing no body can stop me,paper,thug mentality,I still believe,hard time huslen."
2,Activision does it again.,"Offal.This game is a collective of all things bad in gaming. Long tedious repetitve levels, hidden collectible idiot races, stupid objectives all aggregate to form mthis disgusting piece of gaming garbage. Why is it that everything Activtision makes so awful? The one star is for the open world otherwise evrything about htis game SUCKS."
2,Who has a comp that strong?!!,"This is absolutly rediculus(iknow i spelled that wrong). u need an x1100 ati radeon 256mb atleast to play that game. as well as a 2.8 ghz processer, if your gonna make a mainstream game like spiderman, you need to make it for on level pcs, not ones almost more powerful than a 360 or a ps3!! the game is great but how the hell would i know, i cant play it at my own house!!!"
5,Quick Tips for Hurried Saints,"Hummel's work here could not be more needed among American Christians today. In a culture that places a great deal of emphasis on doing everything fast and as quickly as possible, the author teaches us how to distinguish the urgent from the important. Drawing heavily upon the life of Jesus, Hummel gives practical tips on how to get the best of our time, rather than our time getting the best of us. This booklet is one every American Christian today should read."
3,tyranny of the urgent,I needed this for class. Book is small. I feel this book could have been given to the students by the teacher. If you can borrow from someone please do. The shipping and handling cost more than the book.
3,Blues? Perhaps.,"These are nice Jam Trax, but not Blues. Well, at least not the type of Blues I am currently interested in. Almost rock-a-billy or beach music-ish. Perhaps Swing Blues, but sho-nuff not Walking Blues.These are still OK trax, but I have put them to the side until my interest (or skill set) changes. If you want real Blues try Band In The Pocket #1. It contains several real Blues trax. BITP is still not perfect, but does contain my current style of Blues liking.The above rating goes for More Blues JamTrax also. It is just ""more"" of the same. Sorry, I just don't care for swing...."
3,Helpful especially if you can read French,"Although the text has many insightful articles in it, roughly one-third of the text is in French. So, unless you're going for your doctorate or you are VERY fluent in French (there are some difficult concepts conveyed here) the text will only be two-thirds helpful."
1,Does not contain any music,"I'm going against the general consensus here. As far as I'm concerned, this DVD stinks. There's no music videos on it. It's just a documentary about her activities while on tour etc. Now you might say ""Yes, that's what the DVD is about. It's a documentary. What's your problem?"". If I bought this in a store and read the cover properly, I may have passed. But I bought it online. Alicia Keys has a music CD by the same title that I think is very good. I think it's fair to assume that a DVD by the same title would contain Music Videos or a live performance of those songs. I like her as an artist. I think she's talented. But I do not care what she does off stage or out of the studio. And I certainly do not want to spend money finding out. This DVD should be marked more prominently as ""Does not contain any music"". I wish I could return this DVD. It is really worthless to me. Just a waste of time and money."
1,Where was the Music?????,"Due to the absence of music this is the worse DVD in my collection! I contacted Eagle Rock, the firm responsible for this piece of TRASH! Yes, Ms Keys has accompolished a great deal in her young life, but not enough to warrent a documentary. If you were so under thirty this DVD might have been interesting? The other issue was the way documentary was written so small on the jacket - like a bait and switch. The company would not refunded my money nor answer the question does she have any real DVD with music - no response!Ms Keys you are good but you are not a Lina Horne nor a ELLA F, documentary of these ladies would have been of value. I enjoy watching you sing, not just hearing you sing! You have made enough single release DVDs that you could compound them and release a really good piece of music DVD!Cheated!"
3,Kind of a rip-off,"If I'm correct, this documentary is the DVD that was included with the initial release of ""Diary of Alicia Keys"". My copy includes both this DVD and the CD, so if you don't want to waste money, make sure your online purchase of ""Diary"" is the 2-Disc edition."
2,Very Disappointed,This was a boring series of scenes of her backstage; maybe should have read description better; thought is was a performance dvd
5,Silly but fun,Silly movie but fun. Great value for the money Just make some popcorn and open a Mountain Dew and you'll be all set. Much cheaper than going to the show. ENJOY!!!!
4,Interesting,The idea is very interesting and the cast (as many other reviewers have noted) is excellent! Some parts were a little dry and there were times when I really liked how the stories wove together and other times when it came across as sort of trite. When you take into consideration that this is a low-budget movie and the first film for the (writer??) that bumps it up quite a bit. I recommend seeing this film and I would love to see redux with the same cast.
4,Twenty Bucks,"This was a good film. It was more of an independent film,so it probably went unnoticed by lots of people. It is a portrait of how money changes hands, and who's hands it changes to. It is a series of little stories and a twenty dollar bill is passed around through all of the character's. Definitely worth a look for anyone interested in short intelligent stories."
5,Drug War Heresies,"Drug War Heresies may be the best book ever written about modern U.S. drug policy. Written by a psychologist and an economist, the authors draw on attempts to control other substances (such as alcohol prohibition in the U.S.) and exhaustively examine the alternative and experimental European drug policies that most American readers will find particularly useful. The authors are careful to not impose their values and beliefs into their work, instead focusing on the consequences of alternative drug policies. The result is a persuasive case for policy reform in America that is not doctrinaire. Required reading for all who are interested in illicit drug policy in America."
5,An intense look at what makes more than a warrior,The story thrives on the concept that martial arts is only the first step of a much more powerful force. The characters are true to life and compelling from the start to the finish. A must read that is almost impossible to put down.
2,ultimate B-movie,"I waited a long time to see Big Money Hustla$. When I finally found it, I bought it, got home and popped it into the VCR and got ready to be blown away. 30 minutes later, I couldn't wait till this thing ended. I'm a loyal juggalo and all but BMH was just... not funny. Even Harland Williams was stale. ICP are so funny on their albums it's so hard to believe this thing was so dry of wit and hilarity. In fact, more then half of this movie is just Jay asking random people ""where's my (edit) money?"". All the jokes featured in this movie have already been done before at least 10,000 times. BMH just doesn't work. It drags on and on and on and never renews your faith. It just keeps getting worse. I found myself bored within the first half hour. It's just so bad. Much clown luv."
1,Allmost Unwatchable,"Being an Insane Clown Posse fan to say I was disappointed in this is an understatement. This movie has nothing to do with there music and has none of it in it. This movie isn't so bad its good its just plain bad. Plots bad, acting horrible, and the dialogue is so ridiculous its almost unbearable. I would only recommend this movie for hardcore ICP fans. If your looking at this movie because you enjoy there music you'll be very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
4,WOOP WOOP!,"Here's the deal: If you're a Juggalo, you'll love this movie. In fact, if you're a REAL Juggalo, you probably already have this movie.If you have no idea what I've been talking about, you're not a Juggalo and you won't get it anyway.You may still like the fat girl but you Just.Won't.Get.It."
3,ICP on the Big Screen,"For a first movie written and directed by the psychopatic ranks, it was just that... a first and beginning. It was everything it was suppose to be: an underground movie. The special effects were tacky, the script was simple, and the music was icp-flava. But it was alot of fun to watch. This movie was so chaotic, it was great. Cheesy and bad, but ridiculously funny. ICP at their best. Twiztd was over-shadowed by the Wicked Clown. Twiztd's ""Follow George"" act made portrayed them as the annoying little brother that always wants to ""play"" with the big boys. If you're a Juggalo, you'll love it. If not, don't bother. If you're curious, rent it."
1,All out foolishness!,"This is a phony rap type group who looks foolish, acts foolish and their music(!) is horrible. As an actor, I would not want to mention this on my resume!This film seeks to play on all of the most memorable sterotypes of the so-called blacxploitation films of the 1970's. Except that the cast is mainly white with corny rapper wannabes. ""Insane Clown Posse."" If the name alone does not let you know not to take them seriously, then the makeup should. Is that does not work, then there is their music. Stay away from anything with their name on it.Don't get me wrong, I like foolish ""B"" movies, but the qulaity kind. Cliches in film show no originality and just an effort to say that they made a movie. This sucks."
5,"icp , twizted, mysery what more could u want",dude this movie is the funnuest damn thing on the face of the earth. ive atched it hundreds of times sence it came out and that was like a week ago. mcl juggalo 4 life
3,icps in the mu fu howussssssssss,"this movie has cactus jack in it on one paRT.its terribly low budget.the 2 clowns are at odds.shaggy is a private eye in love with a plus size stripper and jay is the bad guy.theres a really big fat chick stripping during one part.that could scar a kid for life!as far as movies by bands go,its better than elvis and the beatle movies except yellow submarine.its better than tommy and the kiss movies too.it beats the shi$ out of moonwalker.any true jugalo will like it.ive yapped enough about the chick i think.icps in da house man!"
3,we have some creepy studies,"I have not spent much time with this book. I have mentioned copy-cat crimes so often in my analysis of how tempting it can be to join in social behavior that I was not surprised to find copy-cat crimes listed in the index as a topic that applied to movies. In agreement with where I found it in this book, I quote:Which brings us to Taxi Driver (1976), the ultimate vigilante picture -- an intentionally ironic fable . . . (p. 167).That is in Chapter 6, The Violent Arts: Pop Goes the Culture. Chapter 5, Counter-Counterculture: . . . is food for thought if you want to become more like me."
5,"Solid, clever, fun book","Trencher's subtitle says the book is going to focus on the period 1960 to 1980, but it actually provides throughout a solid historical background, sticking close to the sources. The book is well organized, clearly written, and says a lot about anthropology's shift from a science orientation to its current circumstances. I wish I had discovered this book earlier, but the mish-mash that comes out of anthropology these days makes any venture into the field a chancy endeavor. Trencher delivers a solid analysis -- there's no risk in purchase here. My only objection is the price, which runs nearly $100 at the time of writing."
4,A Bit Large,"This hat is as it looks but, this one size fits all, does come a bit large. The value is very good."
5,70's Scene,"Bruce J. Schulman's takes a look at how the Seventies shaped the political structure of today. The book actually stretches from 1968 to 1985 and Mr. Schulman deftly shows how the country's political power shifted from the Northeast to the South and how the country moved from the prevailing liberalism of the left to the conservative right. Along the way he discusses the presidencies of Nixon, Carter & Reagan and the social and cultural movements such as Women's Lib, The New South, Minority Equality and others as well as issues like property taxes, environmentalism, skyrocketing inflation and the energy crisis. Interspersed among all the political talk is a look at the music, film, television and how they mirrored the times. Mr. Schulman does a superb job of showing how the 70's seemed to a time of malaise, but actually shaped our country more than we think."
4,Good Assessment,"This book contains an excellent, detailed description of the domestic social and political trends of the 1970s -- actually, notwithstanding the title, of the years 1969-1984. In a sense the book explores the early manifestations of the forces that resulted in G. W. Bush's victory last year, more than a decade after the book's time frame. It is, however, a commentary on, rather than a narrative of, events. The reader who knows little about the period covered should first read a more conventional history in order not to miss (for example) the full melodrama of Watergate as it unfolded its secrets and surprises over the weeks and months."
4,Not quite what I was looking for.,"This seems to be more of an editorial on the events, as to a simple compilation. It is not what I expected, but it's okay. Probably shouldn't be used as a reference book."
3,Great Content with not-so-great treatment,"This book tries to convince the readers that the 70's were truly watershed years in american politics, society and culture. But it fails. The one conclusion that I drew after completing the book was that the 70's were definitely the ""wasted years"". Even though the topics covered in the book are great, they seem disconnected throughout the book. The author is repetitious and at times, contradictory. He uses the same examples to prove several conflicting points. However, the part when the author talks about the Carter presidency is interesting and informative. Also, the rise of the Sunbelt conservatism in American politics and how it has come to dominate the polity in this country is a topic which has been treated well in this book. Other than that, the book is disjointed and tries to be at several places at the same time. Buy it only if you cannot find any other book on the same topic."
4,"Schulman, The Seventies",Excellent survey of the 1970s. I bought this book for a research paper along with Schulman's book on LBJ and enjoyed both readings. Excellent historical overview.
1,Failed attempt at sensationalist history,"The Seventies lays out a timeline based solely on what the author wants to prove, with very little interruption by anything that might not have caught his fancy (for good or ill) about the decade. I guess you shouldn't expect too much from a 260 page book that purports to cover an entire decade, but much of the research and analysis are very sloppy. The author frequently uses quotes from other sources out of context (the song ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is presented as a pro-Wallace song and a William Faulkner quote from his 1956 essay On Fear is presented as if it were uttered in specific reference to the 70's). If you have unsophisticated ideas about politics, cuture and human nature and see the world in black & white, this is the book for you. If you want a nuanced and clear presentation of the history of the 70's, get in line."
1,Incredibly insulting to women.,"As a woman who is proud of the many facets and advances of the Women's Movement, I am quite concerned at how insulting this literature is to the author and anyone else endorsing his work. By labeling the enhanced focus by women on women's issues as a continuation of narcissistic counterculture, you, Sir, are committing a serious injustice against the brilliant determination and strength of the women involved in bravely establishing our gender as much more than a mere accessory to the men of our society."
1,for real?,Stanley Kubrick and Pink Floyd are nowhere to be found in the index...and people consider this a definitive text on the Seventies? Try again.
5,great summary of great women,This book is an inspiration for any woman that thinks she can't do it. Every woman in this book proves that every woman can do whatever she wants - and do it well.
1,"A deatiled book for use only on an ""as needed"" basis.","I'm very disappointed in this book, although some information IN it is valuable, it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover. It is an excellent Textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular basis and find ideas for what you need. Although broken into sections, they are not readily found or visible. One must search the information needed as in a research assignment. The reproducibles are MAINLY for elementary grades. This was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it's contents, on-line. Although the price was reasonable, I'm not pleased with the way the book is organized & printed."
4,Camera Bag,"Nice camera bag. Ample room, though I've outgrown it already since I've been collecting glass. It could use a bit more padding for protecting it's precious contents. A good starter bag."
2,Don't expect much for this low price...,"The case is the best part of this violin outfit. The violin is very cheaply made. After only three uses, the bow snapped at the tip. Within a month of intermittent use, the bridge cracked in half. Both of these pieces were irreparable and had to be replaced at a cost of $40. If you're looking for a cheap instrument that you will receive quickly, you might want to try this one but don't expect much. If you're looking for a quality instrument, look elsewhere."
3,The Chronicles of Galen Sword - interesting,I read the first two books of the Chronicles of Galen Sword in the early 90's and I have long waited for book 3. It's good and does answer some questions but I was hoping for more answers and not just to have the authors leaving things hanging.
2,Ok book,"These airplanes are not so simple to make, my 10 yes old needed a lot of help with instructions and he's an A student"
2,torn cover,"All notifications and shipping were ok, but the quality of the book was not accurately described. This book was very worn looking and the spine of the book was torn."
2,An example would be nice?!,"I have no qualms with the book itself, in truth I have yet to read it, but what peeves me is that I have no guarantee or proof that I'm actually buying Super Simple Paper Airplanes. I can't even make a simple glider. What am I supposed to do with a book that is under the assumption that your hand-eye coordination is functioning at the speed of light? What about people like me who trip over their hands because we are so clumsy, where's an example to whet our appetite for this book? So far, all I have is Amazon's summary and other people's reviews. But that is not to say that the people at Amazon or the customer's who bought it are experts, they could be intermediate flyers or beginner flyers. I probably need Making Paper Airplanes 101 I'm so bad."
5,Even I can make these,I got this book from the library and now am buying it because it is such a hit with my 3 and 6 year old boys. I am able to make all the designs easily and my six year old is able to make most of them by following the pictures. I highly recommend it.
2,"NOT ""super simple""","The reviewer ""hackedad"" is 100% correct in reviewing this book. While there may be some models in the book that are ""super simple,"" there are many that are very complex - way too complex for a beginner. If you don't know origami, you should expect to have difficulty making many of the models in the book."
4,Not bad.... not really scary.,"This movie is about some teens kids that enter a old house that was owned by an man that got hung 15 years in the past. And now with the new generation on kids going to this house to play a little dare with there UNDIE's, they notice that one by one the kids get SLASHED and killed by a murder host thats also in this house that there is no escape becasue the house is rigged with goodies!! This movie is at least an rental. Give it an shot,,, its not that bad."
1,The only thing killer about this movie is how bad it (was),"This movie is an insult to intelligent horror fans.Killer instinct is so predictable. I figured out who the killer was in the first 10 minutes of the film. This film also has its share of the horror cliches for example(Phones Dead!,shower scene,everyone who was sex is murdered,characters wander off alone only to be killed one by one when they could have just stayed together and survived.) This film is your typical slasher film and it doesnt add anything new to the genre. Dont buy or rent this because it (...),YOUVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Hoped for more,I had hoped that with this clarifier my pond would stay crystal clear all season. It has not. I have a small pond and even with this product I am still getting algae. I still have to clean the algae out by hand every two or three weeks.
3,I am the author of this book!,"Dear Readers,I had cancelled this version of my book (not sure why it's still listed) because I have done a 'revision' of this book titled 'Revelation Unsealed! Book One' (available on amazon) which is a much better book in my estimation.They are basically the same book, only the cover has changed and there is much more information in 'Revelation Unsealed! Book One'.I had no other way of letting you know this information other than rating my own book - but I did want you to know that if you are interested in my book, the revision, Revelation Unsealed! Book One is the one to buy, and not this one.Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you.D.M. Wessel"
5,"short,sweet",This toy is very nice for ages 10+. So girls can write and draw and expris her feels. Put this on your list.
1,BIGGEST HOLIDAY DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"Santa brought this toy for me and it is a piece of garbage. Thankfully, my mom retained the packaging and Santa will be getting his gift back!! No part of this toy is good, it does not work! Once the password is set, after a million trys, anyone can get in, but only at random. This toy would be a great gift to give someone who you want to frustrate or annoy!"
3,Well it sort of works......,"Its hard to set the date and time coz I`ll say 4:43pm and she would say 7:22pm? is that right? and I would say no and she would say cya l8ta and the same with the date. I kept on low sercuity level because some of the reviews say its hard to get in with a password. You have to be quiet but clear when you say it and don`t tell anyone your password, (I could put it on hi sercuity level but I want to be able to get in) The notebook is to small!!! and theres no storage space. SOMETIMES IT CAN GET VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!! but otherwise its a good idea!"
4,Great for girls!,I recently purchased the password journal for my 10 year old girl. She loved it!! It has so many things you can do to it. She really loved the stamps! She also really enjoyed that you can create your own cover to make it different then others. I would definately recommend this to anyone with girls between 7 and 11!!!
3,Found a manual!,"To be honest, I gave this toy all 3's because we haven't had a chance to play with it yet -- lost the directions Xmas day and the current version's directions aren't on Radica's website. However, I found this link to the UK's version directions:http://www.radicauk.com/product/instructions/75015%20Manual_Global.pdfHope this helps other lost souls. I will make a strenuous effort to post an actual review once we've had a chance to actually use it!"
1,Journal,"I received this quickly and in good condition, but the journal doesn't always understand the password and gets difficult to use."
1,Password Journal disappointment,"I got this product for my daughter. The password feature was difficult to program and the voice recognition was so precise it was almost impossible to reproduce the right voice inflection and pattern for the journal to recognize. My daughter often could not make the journal open. After a frunstrating week or two, she stopped playing with it altogether."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,My 10 year old daughter got this for Christmas and we returned it to Toys R Us two days later. It would only recognize the password after you said it about 10 times and then it would turn off. It did not let her do anything else just shut itself off!!!I can't believe Toys R Us sells this piece of junk especially after all these bad reviews. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Prying it open wasn't fun...,"i got a password Journal kind of like this and i truly loved it but it didnt recognize my voice, my sister tryed it and it opened. Everytime I had to take out the batteries and put them back in so it would open again, i think they should just make it a number password thing instead of voice recognition. i ended up breaking it fromprying it open. haha otherwise this toy was pretty fun"
3,Intruder!!!,"My 8-year old daughter received this for Christmas. She was extremely excited. Our initial impression was positive. It was reasonably well made, and seemed to include enough extras. The impression went downhill once we tried the ""voice recognition"" features (I use that term loosely). It is an extraordinarily frustrating experience trying to program this item. The room you are in when recording needs to be dead quiet. Your words need to be enunciated to the utmost.If you fail to properly ""say"" your password more than twice, you are shouted down as an ""intruder"". My daughter loves that feature. Pretty creative, actually.The radio in the pen is pretty lame. The shredder works, but jams easily. Plus, the force you put on the pen to shred leads me to believe the pen won't be around for long.All in all, an OK product."
4,"A wonderful, whimsical Tarot Deck","I love this whimsical Tarot Deck ,as will any catlover. Though the cats are in ""costume"", it's not cutsey per se, but rather like any serious Tarot Deck. The cards are nice and slim with a wonderful feel in the hands. I am very happy with my choice."
4,Startech 250 Watt Replacement Atx Power Supply,"I made this purchase to replace a blown power supply from a low ender HP tower (you can use search engines to for reasons why there is no power and a green blinking light on the back of the power supply). Prior to removing the old unit, I took photos of all the connections and any labelling as well as backing up my data.Installation of the Startech power supply was easy. The screws holes matched up perfectly as well as the fit in the case. Making the few connections from the Startech power supply took a few minutes. There are no labels on the Startech connections like on the HP original so the photos helped. After all the connections were made, the desktop powered right up and is much quieter than the original.In my opinion, this is a good model for those on a budget."
2,"Runs hot, short life","I installed this power supply as a replacement from Gateway. From the moment I installed it, it did not cool sufficiently. Within a year it had failed completely."
5,make it happen,This product was the right fit for my Dell. The Dell desk top is working fine now and the price was great.
4,Good product,Arrived fast and was as advertised. Only problem was one screw hole didn't line up so I just left it out. Could easily drill the hole in the case one size bigger to fix the problem but didn't really care enough to do it. Other than that the product powered up my sons old computer and is working great so far.
5,An excellent book,Anyone who have learnt embedded microcomputer systems by datasheets knows that it is not an easy task. There are many important details in many different sources. Dr. Valvano's book contains the most important concepts and lots of examples. The book is mainly suitable for anyone who wants to learn the 68xx family. The simulation software is good and very easy to use. The specific objectives of the book include: 1) advanced architeture; 2) interfacing external devices to computer; 3) advanced programming and 4) embedded applications.
3,:A good start book in the microprocessor based system,"I have looked through this book. It contains a lot of detailed and hand-on examples on the Motorloa MC68HC based system design. The beginner will get a good sense on how to design a small scale microprocessor based system or real time interface. But the book include too much detail on difference between MC68HC chips (6805, 08, 11, 12). The reader may easily got lost with those redundant information. The book may be good for some junior student or engineer to have a feeling on the real time system design but I will not recommend it to experienced people in this area."
3,"wonderful sound, but.....","I have 2 SA3 amplifiers that drive outdoor speakers at a weekend getaway(cabin) property. We have many wonderful memories of unbelievable music in front of an outdoor fire listening to our Bose lifestyle system. In the last 6 years, I have had to replace 2 different units. Thankfully, Bose support is 2nd to none and they will get you a replacement at a refurbished cost of around $70.00 if I remember. Besides the Lifestyle system and the remote amps being a little finicky, my ONLY beef is the connector. It is not a traditional speaker wire connector and if you use thick wire to drive the power, good luck. Unfortunately, you will need a flat eyeglass screwdriver and a set of eyes younger than 50. I will be replacing my second SA3 with Bose support soon. We can't say enough about the sound quality, but sure wish they would be less problematic. If I ever build another house, I would consider using this same system if they would only fix the speaker connectors."
5,A great album,The song Enchanted Forest didn't catch my attention for a while. I sometimes skipped it. The funky title song was the kind of thing I was looking for. But now Enchanted Forest is a song that I find mezmorizing.
4,Good Specialty Sheryl Crow Import,Has 3 songs on itAll of which are Great songs but on the whole not the best single album she has put out.1-There goes the Neighborhood-Radio edit2-Straight To The Moon-Non LP Track3-My Favorite Mistake-Live
1,giant perm wrap papers,"I wish there was a lower rating than one star because that is way over rated - they are the worst i have ever seen. As soon as they touch your roller they tear apart and disintergrate so that you have to start over. I ended up using ones I had left from a previous perm, and trashing these. Don't waste your money."
4,Reliable Case Holder for portable DVD,This is a nice case for people who need to attach a DVD player to their car. I have an 8 inch portable DVD player and it just fits. It would actually be better for players that are smaller. But we make it work and my daughter loves watching her Sesame Street DVDs in the car. What a life saver on long trips! (and short ones too!)
3,Good,"Good deal! It fits my 9"" DVD player just perfect. Will not hold batteries..good for permanent fitting to the cars as a suspension system. Not enough space for holding stuff other than the DVD player."
2,it works okay,"This is a nice looking case, but the hooks for the car are extremely difficult to hook and unhook, there is only pockets enough for 4 dvd's and the dvd player will not sit all the way open when you are using it. All in all it serves it's purpose, but I think I could have found a better option."
2,Not the right size,"This product is fine as far as a holder for you car goes, but it does not hold our 9"" DVD player. I had to return it. We did own the same one for our 6"" and it worked great."
4,works well,"Easy in easy out. my 12u daughter needed something to protect her leg when sliding, however needed something she could get into quickly as she also is a catcher with little time to get gear off and on between innings. so far it has worked great. Bought it 2 months ago and it has held up well. during games she also wears knee length socks, but in practice she tends to wear ankle socks, this where the easy slider comes in very handy as she loves the dirt. she is not the fastest kid on the team but i can not see where it slows her down anymore, nor does it move around while running.very happy so far"
3,Cooder Fills In The Blanks,"Overall, this album inhabits the space between new age, instrumental rock, acoustic blues and world music. You could safely consider it a dry run for his collaborations with V.M. Bhatt, in that it touches on the same stylistic stew, but in embryonic form. Granted, there are more cohesive soundtrack recordings by Ry Cooder in the catalog; however, anthologies and best-ofs by their very nature are not as stylistically unified. The unreleased cuts on this collection, taken on their own, would be worth five stars...in fact, some cuts (and I'm thinking of the ""Theme From Southern Comfort"" here) are absolutely breathtaking and, I think, essential. This recording's a nice way to fill holes for the Ry Cooder fanatic, and a good departure point for the uninitiated that want a taste of instrumental Ry."
2,Disappointing,"As a fan of Ry's work (early, mid-period, & ethnic explorations)I looked forward to this 2 CD compilation of his soundtrack work. However, it really doesn't stick to the ribs. Aside from the really fun Ice-T/Ice Cube summit in King Of The Streets, this is mostly boring background music that is just OK as ""atmospheric"" stuff. Anyone who needs this sort of thing should just get the Paris, Texas soundtrack & call it a day."
2,Save your money,"This is the lamest of Ry Cooder's CDs. Save your money and find a copy of soundtrack to Blue City, a forgetable (thank God!) movie with wonderful music."
5,It's a GREAT clamp - and great Amazon price,"I purchased 2 of these Wolfcraft ratcheting band clamps - and I absolutely LOVE them! I may purchase some more.I make lots of picture frames and and all sorts of boxes. These clamps make glue-up SO MUCH EASIER. I get much tighter joints, much easier to get the item absolutely square, and all with only ONE HAND. My previous method was to use multiple individual corner clamps, then cross clamps. Not enough hands, or room on the workbench. Now - just loop around the object, place the corner pieces in place - and release the handle - the band is spring-loaded and automatically tightens. Then, adjust the item like you want, and tighten down on the ratcheting handle. DONE.I've tried other types of band clamps - and none work as well as this!Great product."
3,porcelin drll bit,"good shipping, bit is over rated and extremly over priced. drilled 6 holes with some difficulty.I never let the bit get hot and drilled at low speed. after the 12th hole for grab bars in a shower stall I was worn out and returned the 3rd grab bar I wanted to in stall."
4,A good series,"Discusses the life cycle of humans and other mammals, plants, insects, frogs, reptiles, and birds. The concept of fertilization is not mentioned and the sexes are only alluded to once where a cat that had kittens was noted to be a she. In the discussion of reptiles, it seems all snakes can lay eggs based on this sentence. ""When a reptile such as a snake is fully grown, it can also lay eggs."" That seems a little too vague. The text asks the reader simple questions and provides answers at the back of the book. Life Cycles includes a simple glossary, bibliography, and index. Other entries in this series rate five stars, such as ""Plants"" and ""Changing Forms."" Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
3,Wondorous Pictures,"Turgid German scholarship locked into tracing classical sources cannot conceive the creative brilliance which is such a feature of Florentine Renaissance art, surpassing all others. Moreover, thoroughness is a means, not a virtue. The illustrations, by contrast, are brilliant."
4,Mexican league is in this game!!!,"Wow! The Mexican league is in this game and also Argentina's and Brazil's. You gotta get this game the gameplay is good, not great but I for sure will say it's way better then FiFa and almost as good as Winning Eleven Seven. I am just shocked and so excited that they finally put the Mexican league in here and the other south american league's too. Thank's 989' and keep up the good work. I bet 2006 will be your year and I'll be looking forward to buying your game, just as long as the Mexican league is in it : )"
4,"Now available in ""Organic"" (but still seedy)","My local supermarkets have shrunk their jam selection but I still found a jar with acceptable ingredients (organic sugar, organic raspberries, citric acid and pectin.) This tastes nice enough to me that I'm not sent barreling towards artisanal jam makers in despair at the lousy ingredients and taste of mass market products. I don't care about the organic label so much but the straightforward ingredients and NO corn syrup make me happy.But Italian rainbow cookies require seedless raspberry jam so bear that in mind."
1,Bitterness--the result of bad theology,"It is clear that Mr. Appleman is very bitter about the terrible theology that passes as ""Christianity"" today. In a very important sense, it is not Mr. Appleman's fault that he feels so negatively and so strongly.The fault is terrible exegesis and the total failure by the evangelical world to read the Bible as a collection of ancient Near Eastern documents. In truth, a literal interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, etc. DESERVES Mr. Appleman's ridicule, and indeed all of our ridicule.However, when we understand the Bible in its original context, every single problem that Mr. Appleman raises disappears. While modern evangelicals bring this criticism upon themselves, it is Mr. Appleman's job to know the difference between the popular modern interpretation of Scripture and what the original authors meant to convey to their original audience.Let us all be reasonable, sensible, and truthful."
1,Colossal waste of $,This book isn't about apraxia; it's about web sites dealing with apraxia. The book offers nothing that one couldn't find on a Google search.
5,None of their early trashy punkish noise but all of great dark melodies,"Best JD Comp out there. great programing/sequence. ends with atmosphere and then love will tear. None of their early trashy punkish noise featured on substance but all of dark melodies. I cannot stand the way substance starts. Division has 2 sounds and i prefer the later. Their first music, to include warsaw material, was dull and undistinguishable from other hardcore and screechy noise late 70's punk rock trios. But there late career foray into new-wave melodramatic goth-rock was goundbreaking and has never sounded dated."
4,Dance Dance Dance,"It is true. The quality is not so hot but imagine that this is a sign of the time. The brilliance is under the hood. Really Joy Division were and still are timeless. Their songs are a dark monotonous melancholy that rolls out the red carpet for dance. No one can deny that when it comes to ""Love will tear us a Part"". If you like New Order, Dada Pogrom, Depeche Mode then you will like Joy Division. I can guarantee this 100%."
1,Remastered?,"If this is how you remaster something, no thanks. Basically all they did was boost the loudness and limit the dynamic range like most cheesy pop albums nowadays. This distorts the music and gains you nothing that turning up the volume knob a notch or two while listening to the originals can't get you. Compare them with the un-""remastered"" versions in a wav editor if you don't believe me.Oh, there is also not much reason to get this seeing as there isn't a bad song on any of their original albums. Start with Unknown Pleasures or Substance."
2,bad remastering,"Shrugging off the other reviews about the bad remastering, I bought this CD eager and excited to listen to the great compilation of songs. But I just want to caution all potential buyers, the sound remastering is VERY poor and it's difficult to listen to. If you like the quality of Closer and Unknown Pleasures, then I think you'll be disappointed with this one. And this is coming from someone who is usually not particular about recordings. ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" sounds distorted and flat and the sound remastering kills the quality of most of the other songs as well."
4,Why this CD matters,"Track 1 is the alternate version of Love Will Tear Us Apart. It was the B-side of the 12"" single. As far as I'm aware, this version isn't available on any other Joy Division CD release."
1,Yawn....,"First off, the first two songs ""Love..."" and ""Transmission"" are far and away the two best things on here. Every thing else is pretty lame except for the baroque synth washes that color the otherwise lifeless ""Isolation (mercifully put there, so I've heard, by the band's producer against the band's wishes. Thank YHWH.) So, dear reader, it is my advice to you that if you want to invest in JD, buy this one. 'Cause if this is the ""best of,"" I shudder at what the rest sounds like...."
3,Buy it just for track 16!,"The new remix of Love Will Tear Us Apart is my favorite song on here, It's just as good as the original but with an added guitar twist. Basically it's your typical ""best of"" album, and in my humble opinion it's pretty good, except however they left out the two greatest and most depressing songs of all time: Decades and The Eternal. But anyway it's a good compilation and the permanent mix of Love Will Tear Us Apart is worth it."
1,"""Best Of"" & ""Joy Division"" - Reissue, Repackage","This compilation is expendable. It's aimed at those too cheap to shell out for Unknown Pleasures, Closer, Still and Substance. There is nothing on this recording you would gain from owning the other four, and so much you would be missing. You're not buying snacks for a party or the cheapest beer for your visiting relatives here. This is your future we're talking about and you're negating the chance to colour any experience or event with the cynicism, insight and optimism of these albums. Go study your Fac numbers and buy 10, 25, 40 and 250 now. Add FACD 219 if you're serious."
5,This one is called Permanent for a reason.,"I was born and raised on this collection. This one captures the the perfection Ian Curtis achieved in his latest sound. Personally, I think the track order is masterful and precise. The final three songs, ""Something Must Break"", ""Atmosphere"", and the suprisingly hopeful version of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" leaves me wallowing in the mystery of this band's profundity. This collection marks the refinemnent and haunting depth that Ian Curtis climaxed in. I may be partial to this one because it was my first, but at any rate--its named Permanent for a reason. Experience it and find out why."
1,Buy JD's Substance before you give this CD a spin,"All the other Joy Division albums are worth their weight in gold. This CD was compiled in 1995 by a major label. Very very very bad sequence of songs. Substance is authentic to the true roots of Joy Division. I'd recommend that CD if you are interested in Joy Division. All their other CD's deserve 5 stars (Closer, Unknown Pleasures, Still, and Substance). Check those out on Amazon before this one."
3,not at all the best way to get into this excellent group!,"yo're better off with Substance if you don't want to shell it out for Heart and Soul.just all around- a poor comp for a classic group... from track selection through to sound, this disappoints... I think this is a disservice to the band's legacy. Plus this was released by a major label in '95, after Factory went kaput... An attempt by the corporate beigeocracy to cash in on the brilliance and anguish of Curtis and the band."
2,Permanent is not a compilation worth purchasing.,"What were the manufacturers of this compilation attempting to do besides make more money. The songs chosen here all good but then again every song Joy Division made was good. This compilation takes a couple of tracks from both studio albums and throws in several non lp singles. The songs which were chosen do not begin to show the range and overall greatness of the band. This was the first ablum that I bought by Joy Division and it was so dreary that I almost gave up on the band. I did buy the much better compilation ""Substance"" which is a much better representation of the band's music. After listening Substance I decided I had to buy the box set Heart and Soul which is wonderful. ASo if you decide to purchase a joy division album please do not start with Permanent. Almost any other title is a better starting point for a fna than is Permanent."
4,Well written.,"Ms. Dryer is very talented. Her books are clean, well written and suspensful. You won't find any plot holes or unanswered questions. However, the constant sarcasm, dark humor and overwhelming feeling of hopelessness gets old after a while. Personally, I wish she'd lighten up just a bit."
5,One of the few books stolen from me by a friend.,"One of the few books stolen from me by a friend (make that ex-friend). I am greatly comforted to know this book is still available as it is one of the books I cherished most and was so anxious to replace. Hickey is, I believe, a journalist, and this is the only book, a collection of short stories, he has published. Can't remember the specific title of the favorite story, something like ""On the Trail of the Longhorn Cattle"", but it is a classic about an old cowman, alone at home, trapped in a bathtub, with his dead nurse on the tile floor, waiting for his son to return home from a business trip."
1,Misleading Description,The description clearly says a full case. However you only receive a 4 pack. False advertising.
3,Lee Oskar Minor Key Harp,"Lee Oskar harmonicas are built excellently. Great tone, volume, and playability. However, the minor key harp is weird to play. I don't much care for it. I'd rather play a regular richter tuned diatonic in third position. I guess the chords it plays are pretty cool... they sort of have a haunting organ sound. But it's not very usable for me in blues and rock settings."
2,I'm angry!,"I am so mad! I don't know whose fault it is, but this DVD does not contain all the info it claims on its cover! I bought it specifically to watch Ludacris and Wyclef. However, Wyclef is nowhere on here! Yes, I love Kanye's work too. But Kanye, Luda, and Wyclef are all my favorites, so I feel gypped."
5,Bushnell Instant Replay 8 x 32 Binoculars,"I first used this combo binoculars/digital camera on a recent vacation to Kenya. The quality exceeded my expectations. I expecially liked that we could also take mini videos (up to 30 secs) of the animals as well as stills.Negative: The battery compartment is not well designed and inserting batteries is sometimes frustrating.Overall, I am really glad I purchased this product.It is a alot of fun to use."
4,Pretty OK - Out of Kontrol,I just came to a realization I'd like to share with you all.This must be the single worst album of all time for tripping.
4,Not as good as self title,"But it still blows all the others out of the water. This Album is just insane, even the softest song ""Chemical Marriage"" had me jumping around to the sound track esque type music. Much Like California this album has tons of overtones and plenty of random bursts of action. If you are anyone who likes Mr Bungle or Mike Patton (the greates musician ever) then you HAVE to get this."
4,And for someting completely different.,"And here we have the second album from Mr. Bungle. For fans of the first Bungle album expecting the same...don't. In fact, drop all expectations. I was disappointed a little upon my first listen. Gone are the circus noises. Gone are any traditional vocalizations from Patton. Instead, you get a group out to do something outrageously artistic. You get songs which are almost instrumental. I say instrumental, because in most of the songs, Patton uses his voice as an additional instrument, instead of singing easy-to-understand lyrics. After multiple hearings, the album gets better as you accept the different style of thge album. The genius is heard. But I still listen to this album the least of the three Mr. Bungle albums. I still recommend it, though, to any fan of Bungle or other artistically challenging bands."
5,You wanted music...,"..and you got it. This is pure incredible music. When Mr. Bungle's fans were expecting more SONGS, they threw this at them. Yeah, it will drive you insane, but it will also help you appreciate more types of music. Listening through this album a couple times straight without doing anything else will help build anyone's attention span."
4,Different,"This one's a little harder to digest than the self titled album....if you've ever heard the first album you'll realize that's asking alot...but change is good, a lot more experimental sounds are used and new styles are explored....some wacked out death metal/jazz songs are here and there while ""chemical marriage"" sounds like the theme to some adventure flick...all in all, a crazy damn album that should please fans of the first..if you're just getting into Bungle though, pick up the self-titled and then move to this....virgin brains should not be exposed to this kind of stuff..."
3,hmmmmm,"Disco Volante is an album that I can't decide wether to give it 1 star or 5 stars. Like their debut Disco Volante goes through many different styles, but on this album the changes seem a lot more awkward and forced. There is also a lack of actual music, sometimes it's just kooky sounding noise. Despite it's many faults the album does contain many memorable songs and anyone with a brain should give them credit for trying something different. If you are thinking of getting into Mr. Bungle buy Mr. Bungle or California first, then buy this as more of an afterthought."
3,Awrite.,"This is my least favorite Mr.Bungle CD in my collection. I liked California and the self titled album quite a bit more. This album is more hard hitting and aggressive and quite frankly, a little uglier than the other two that I own. I enjoyed parts of this CD and at least it maintains a constant ugly vibe. This is a good thing in my book. I feel that the first song is the weak point of the album and it's mighty bad. The third track makes up for it however so don't worry about it. I can't really reccomend this CD because you must possess an odd taste for music to appreciate it so do with this review what you will. All I can really say is that if you enjoyed the vast majority of the self titled album, then you might very well feel that this CD is worth the money."
3,a disappointment,"In my time as a Mr bungle fan I had danced around this album picking up the self titled debut album and the last ""California"". Both of these albums are out of this world. As for this album it is a drastic drop off in quality as a whole. Somewhat simular to fantomas but not nearly as good to be honest. There are a couple of bright moments on the album that shine through and make me proud to be a bungle fan but in the end this album does not meet expectations."
2,Bungle Ok,"As wondeful as Patton is, this album can rate no more than promising. As much as tracks as Desert Search, Merry Go... and Chemical Marriage impress, the album as a whole is an incoherent, yet occcasionally enjoyable, struggle."
1,Love the album but this LP edition is a piece of crap!,Plain Recordings has really messed up a great album. The masterings sucks! Really quiet and with crappy dynamics...And also none of the credits or the great artwork are there either...I have once owned the CD and it was superior in every way .Really disappointed!
5,This is a crazy CD.,This is excelent CD.It might take a while for you to see how good this is.The music ranges from metal to polka.Buy this one.
1,Ouch!,"This has to be the sound of explosive diarrhea through a decoder or synthesizer. Man, this is painful!"
2,Self indulgence at its worst.,"I'm frankly dismayed at all of the 5-stars given here. I don't think anyone can honestly admit that they are 'hooked' on tracks like 'The Bends"" and 'Merry Go Bye Bye'. Give me a break! If you say you are, then you are lying! Musicianship aside, this is self-indulgence at its' worst.There are some good tracks on here like 'Platypus' and 'Desert Search....', that saves me from giving this a 1 star."
1,Are these guys serious?,"I have the first Mr. Bungle album--loved it. I had my girlfriend get their 2nd one, Disco Volante for me. I anxiously popped it into my CD player and give it a good listen. I thought, ""Wow, this is terrible!"" but I listened to it again and again because I thought it could grow on me. NO chance. This album is truly awful and it shocks me to read that people gave this album 5 stars. It just goes to show that any single band in the world can put out an album that sick people will love and rave about."
1,Music? No.,"[Note: I am not a kid, I simply don't have an Amazon account!]Please, let's not even pretend that this is music. Having heard what Patton (and more crucially his voice) is capable of in Faith No More and Mr Bungles self titled album, I find this album to be an obnoxious, aragant waste of time. I LOVE the origional Bungle album, and purchased this hoping for a continuation of the inventive genious. I simply cannot get across how utterly appauling this album is. If you think that displaying a tissue with the contents of your nose in it is 'art', then you may consider this 'music'. It is not only unpleasant, it is, in my opinion, unlistenable to.I am now going to invent a time machine to go back to this afternoon and stop myself buying this piece of garbage.THIS ALBUM IS NOT WORTH THE DISC WHICH IT IS ON. BUY THIS AT YOUR PERIL."
1,Strictly Amateur,"Several people at the Zappa.com forum recommended this CD, so I was interested in hearing it. But I'm clearly not Mr. Bungle's intended audience. Their music is much too primitive and mundane for my taste."
1,Worst Mary Carey Movie ever,"I got to admit I am a huge fan of mary carey and this one was highly disappointing,the acting was horrible but thats to be expected being a T & A flick but not much T & A in this one so pass on it if thats what your looking for."
2,Oh Brother,This printer has had more problems and we haven't had it long at all. All error messages have been flashing. We turn it off and on to clear the messages more than we print. Customer service is not helpful at all. Very disappointed with this product. Have several others in the office just like it but I guess I got the bad batch.
3,Print then throw away - 2 STARS,"EDIT TO PREVIOUS REVIEW - DROP TO 2 STARSI originally gave this printer a 5 star because it was a fast, inexpensive duplex laser printer. However, about six months later, the drum needed replacing and cost more than the entire printer itself. I ended up putting it back in the box and purchasing a new printer. I cannot bring myself to throw it away and yet refuse out of principle to purchase a replacement drum for more than I originally paid.Anyone want a free printer? All you have to do is pick it up...ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have purchased this printer after reading many reviews and have been pleased. It is fast, high quality and makes duplex copying a breeze."
5,Great Printer,"Very fast, great quality, duplex mode and othher options are great. Quick and easy to set up with included cd on Windows. Set up fine on Linux using online instructions."
5,Great product,"As a new gradaute student, I knew I would be needing a laser printer with duplex capabilities. I have had ZERO issues with this machine. In one month I've used a ream of paper and printed mostly double-sided with nearly no problems. I also love that I am allowed to select to ""save toner"", or ""change the resolution"". Sometimes I wish I could program the printer settings MY way. It's easy to forget to click all the buttons for duplexing, toner saving, etc. The only other snag I've encountered occurs when I put new paper into the tray. There is a snug fit in the tray and the machine doesn't like the paper tray to be filled, rather it prefers less paper with more room for the rollers to grab. So, a fair trade off. Great investment no doubt."
1,Great for a while,"I used an iMac and cheap windows notebook with this printer over a network. It was a home printer, and never printed more than a few dozen pages a week.It was simple to set up, and worked great (including duplex) for about six months.Then, it refused to turn on or show any signs of life.I called brother tech support (which was friendly) only to find that there was no ""over the phone"" solution. Unfortunately, the one year warranty was from the date of manufacture (December 2007), so it didn't do me any good since I didn't even buy it until January 2009. So, six months into ownership I tried to find an inexpensive fix and the best I could do would cost more than replacing the printer.It'd be a great printer if it worked, but it failed to do that for me."
3,Works fine so far - but strange noise,"So far, after 3.5 months of light use, the printer has performed very well. My only complaint is the creaking sound that it makes whenever it prints. Don't know if this is indicative of a problem, or merely the normal sound of operation."
4,Works Great with Newer Driver,"I'm using MacOS X (10.4.8), and when I first installed the driver from the included CD, I found that I could not print duplex (both sides). Fortunately, I went to the Brother web site, and got the newer driver (CUPS), and everything is fine."
4,Seems to work fine,"Slow duplex printing. I guess standard memory is too small. Maybe the non postscript driver is faster, but non postscript drivers are a problem more often than not, so I have not tried. The postscript driver works with LaTeX on a Mac, which is better than my experience with Oki. Quality is OK, and the price is right. Much better than inkjet, or that any recent HP I used."
4,Good eneugh for industrial use.,"This network printer has highly configurable network settings and should probably be installed by your systems admin. Being a systems admin myself I found the variety of configuration options refreshing in a market where consumer products are generally dumbed down so much even a monkey couldn't mess it up.FYI the default password to the configuration manager is ""access""."
2,"A fast printer, but versatile and professional it isn't","I bought this printer because of a great experience I had with other Brother printers and FAX systems. The previous unit I owned was an HL-1850 with a great MP tray. It was fast, reliable, consumables were inexpensive and it handled envelopes beautifully.This printer while fast and network ready, it has the worst MP tray ever. It can only hold 6-7 envelopes (#10), it shreds and creases all envelopes no matter what speed the feed, it can't handle more than 10-12 sheets of plain paper. The printer can handle heaier stock, but it curls like a window shade.I'm sorry I bought it. I should have done some homework. After I discovered it's huge flaws, I did some research on the net, and sure enough, the exact problems were described by others.If you want pure speed and a network ready printer--it's fine. But if you need a versatile, reliable and professional printer, this ain't it."
1,Worked well for a while,"This printer worked well for about a year. Right after replacing the drum cartridge my paper started to come out crinkled, then repeatedly jamming. When I finally reached Brother customer service they recommended a heavier weight paper even though I had been using their specified type and weight of paper. They were not helpful. By that time it was out of warranty. Still nursing it along until the toner runs out, but only for drafts."
1,Poor quality on printouts,"I purchased this for my small office. I print a lot of graphics-intensive documents from my Mac G5, and the quality of the printouts is unacceptable. MSWord and Xcel documents print fine, but I have lots of problems with graphics apps - Quark documents print with clean type but jaggy graphics; InDesign and Illustrator files print with jaggy fonts and graphics. These are all files that came out perfectly from my 10-year-old HP before it died! I've fiddled with every adjustment that I can think of, updated the driver, it still stinks. Total waste of money for me."
4,Brother Laser printer,"This is a great printer, the only samll problem is a little culing. Not a big problem."
4,Brother Laser does the job,"I bought this laser as a second home network printer. I have PC's and Macs on the network. The installation went smoothly once I gave the printer a static ip address.The only minor complaint is that the dual side printing (automatic) only works on PC's On the Mac, the best you can do is manual version where the paper has to be put in. So I print my manuals from the PC.Nice price for a good printer!"
5,Owner,"This printer is fast, high quality priting and is a work horse.I had another Brother that I thought was a good printer this one blows its socks off."
2,Jams constantly,I have had this printer now for going on a year. I have had it in for repair once. Print quality is good and the duplexing works fine. The big negative is it jams constantly. At least once every ten pages and often times more often. I have experimented with different weight papers to no avail. I can not recommend this printer.
3,What happened to the rear paper feed?,"Update -- I submitted an inquiry to Brother's online help and they answered within one business day. Turns out it's on the front, not the rear. My bad.This printer says it has a rear feed that holds up to 50 sheets. When I tried to print labels using MS Word it defaults to the rear feed. When I opened the rear door -- guess what? No paper handling devices were there. It's just a door. And the labels or plain paper will not feed into the apparent slot available. Also no manual came with the printer, not even on the install disk. I had to download a pdf file from Brother's website."
5,Ignore The bad reviews...,"The two people that claimed the unit was no good due to the drain on their UPS units are making a huge mistake... You NEVER plug a laser printer into a UPS! It really pays to take the time to read the manual. As an IT Professional, this is common knowledge, but not everyone is a techie, but it would be great if people would read instructions."
4,"Great printer, affordable, duplex printer!!",The Brother 5250DN surprised me. It is a nice package for the money and it works really well in a small home office setting.Best feature - duplex printingWishes - Wireless networking for the same priceOnly complaint - tis a bit noisy.
1,Completely UNRELIABLE!,"As one reviewer mentioned, don't be fooled by the positive reviews of new owners of this printer. Mine worked really well for a few months, and then it started having issues. At one point, all the LED indicators went on at the same, for no reason. The only help from the manual was power it down and backup and hope for the best. After several cycles of powering up and down, the issue seemed fix, and the printer worked again for a few months. The the paper light went on when there was no paper jam, and there was paper in the tray, nothing I did would fix the issue. Now the paper light is off, but the printer won't even print at all, no flashing LEDS, nothing. The status light won't even stay on for more than 10 seconds after I hit the ""Go"" button.I've owned this printer for only 13 months, and now it looks I'm gonna have to buy another one. Piece of junk, don't waste your money!"
2,A Big Disappointment,"My purchase was based on glowing reviews by the likes of PC Magazine and PC World. I thought I had found a great printer. Although the printer is approximately two years old I have only put approx 700 pages thru it.The first signs of trouble were a large crease in the center of each page when paper exited the machine.Then disaster struck. I tried to print and nothing. My computer alerts me it has discovered new hardware ! The status light is red and the printer refuses to print, not even a test page. I quickly learn the computer can't find the printer. Trying to reinstall the drivers won't work. even without it hooked up to the computer the red light won't go out. Upon searching the internet for info I discover I am not alone when it comes to this same problem. No phone number to call for help. Now I have a large paper weight on my hands. Never Again, Brother"
3,"Lots of features, noise and power.","The 5250DN replaced my 10 year old HP LaserJet5P. The HP was a work horse but needed replaced and updating. I've used the Brother for about 2 months.Pros: Duplex printing, built-in ethernet, fast, works well w/ Mac, PC and linux.Cons: LOUD, drains power in my house to the point of dimming lights, keeps rattling and churning after it prints.I put up with the cons but get an almost sinking feeling before I print. The print features and quality are keeping this printer in my house but if I had to do it over I'd probably spend more for the same features."
1,POS,It's been all but problems since I got it... constant stopping with blinking lights and paper jams. One complete breakdown within 4 months that required a trip to the doc and another breakdown months later that earned a trip to the dumpster. I'll just stay away from (Big) Brother from now on.
1,I am my Brothers' keeper. Big mistake.,"I bought two of these. I now own two ""boat anchors.""From the start, the paper pickup was extremely noisy and sounded like something was on the verge of snapping or breaking. This is because something was on the verge of snapping or breaking. I probably got less than a thousand sheets from the first, less than a hundred for the second. The ""paper out"" light is perpetually on now, on both units. After powering off and on, one of them will occasionally still print a page or two, then die again.I just don't have time for the warranty run-around and they will end up on the re-cycling heap. NEVER BY BROTHER. Shoddy, shoddy garbage."
5,High Value Printer,"I've had this printer for several weeks, now, and I'm totally satisfied with it. The network setup was a snap on my XP box, the built-in duplex works well (using it is a choice), and time to 1st print and output speed are great. Duplex, network, and 30 ppm for under $240 is awesome. A rare plus in this price class is the toner cost. Shopping around for the high yield toner cartridge gets the toner cost down to about a penny a page, a rare thing for a printer not in the office workgroup category.I didn't pay any attention to the power complaints. First, you never put a printer on a UPS. Secondly, the power consumption while it is warming up and printing is 1/3 to 1/2 the draw of most hair dryers. Any excessive dimming of house lights says more about the wiring in the building than it does about this printer; it may just have to be plugged into a different circuit.This is a great printer for this price!"
5,Nice Laser Printer for the Multi-PC Home,"We replaced our HP Officejet (ink) printer with this Brother Laser printer. While I have heard a few compliants from the family about ""not doing color."" These are offest with the fact that the Ethernet connection allows us to print from any PC, upstairs or down. The duplex option (print both sides of the paper) operates flawlessly and saves paper. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it to thers looking for a networked laser printer for the home."
3,"Good, but...","The price and features are just right. However, printing leaves roller marks on the paper that while light, ruin shiny paper. Other than that, it prints crisp text images front and back with the duplex option very fast. If it wasn't for the marks on the paper I would have given it a higher score. Overall a solid buy."
2,Cheap printer - in many ways,"The printer creates decent output, and is extremely cheap for a networked duplex printer. But build quality is shoddy, it pulls power far too heavily (if it's not on a 20-amp circuit it'll dim your lights when it prints), and the pages curl when printing in duplex.Even worse, there's no warning when a toner cartridge is about to go, and when it does, all the printer does is light up the ""toner"" light and refuse to print -- even if every page so far has been fine! The printer really needs an override to keep printing even when it thinks toner is low. but then they wouldn't make as much on toner, would they?Review would be a 3 or 4, but a printer that refuses to print is worthless. Faded printouts are better than no printouts. Spend the money on something more reliable."
2,Not up to heavy duity use,"This printer is marketed as a good business printer that can handle a heavy work load. It cannot handle a heavy workload at all. I work for a company that resells these in a business environment. We even have some lying around, but will not use them for our own printing needs as they do not handle heavy work loads. They have a paper feed that is improved over the older type, but still very prone to jams. To aggravate this is that it is a network printer, so it is often located remotely so the jams can go unnoticed for a long time. They are quite picky about the paper they will handle, and we have had big issues with there support."
5,Great Printer for a Great Price,"This is my first Brother printer. I have two macs, one macmini and a macbook. I hooked the printer, via Cat V, to my Dlink DI624 wireless router and it worked like a charm. My macbook installed it automatically and I was up and printing in less than a minute. The macmini (G4) required me to install the CUPS v1.1 driver included on the printer CD. I had the macmini printing in less than two minutes. The printer will auto duplex in Apple OS, the option is Two-Sided printing not Duplex. There is SLIGHT paper curling but nothing unreasonable. I can auto duplex 10 pages before I walk to my second floor to retrieve my prints. The print quality is astounding for graphics and text, even in toner save mode. The ""loud"" noise is only heard for a second as it warms for a print job, ""loud"" is less than a typical microwave. It's your typical plastic case but for auto duplexing and a built in NIC, you can't find a better value. I highly recommend."
4,"Great Price, Great Printer",The price I paid for the printer through Amazon was fantastic compared to buying it directly through an office supply store. And it was brand new too boot! It arrived quickly and was very easy to set up and install. It prints quickly. The print could be a little darker but the off set in price and speed beats what I had previously.
2,"PRINTER MAKES CLICK CLICK NOISE after each print job, same problem as other reviewer","I have this printer and this printer makes click click click noise after each print job. i think its the fuser unit expanding or something. Very annoying, it clicks even after you turn the unit off!"
5,"fast print , easy install, network ready, double side print, all I need in here","Just took me 15 min. from open box, hook up to network,install driver on computer, to print out the frst page from the printer. I really love the double side printing function. print speeed is fast."
3,Brother 52550 laser printer,"Teh product itself is an awesome printer. However, we had to hire a tech specialist to get the thing to talk to us in English. For some reason it spoke only Potugese and nothing we tried worked. Finally our specialist, after two hours at $65 an hour got the thing working. There went any savings we might have enjoyed from buying from Amazon."
2,Crinkle first pages,I have had this printer for almost a year now. The first page gets worse and worse crinkling. I called Brother who said that there is nothing they can do since the problem semes not to be common. They try to blame it on the paper i use but only the first page gets affected. Sequential print jobs still get the first page of each job crinkled. The printer is still under warranty.
2,Short-time pretty good,We have been very pleased with this printer. A good product at a reasonable price. However it stopped working after less than a year of daily use. It was cheaper to buy a new one than to get it repaired.Another printer to recycling. Oh Brother! What do we have to pay to get one that lasts more than a year?
5,Great printer - one flaw,"Printer is fast, prints great. Only flaw I have found is that it wrinkles envelopes - every time."
5,"Great print quality, usability","Sharp print quality and easy network setup for Windows, quiet operation. Brother also supplies Linux drivers on its website which makes setup of a mixed network a snap. Overall a great printer for the money!My network consists of machines with various platforms: Win XP, Win 2000, Ubuntu, and Kubuntu (amd64). Initially, I had a problem forcing the installation of Brother's 32 bit debian drivers onto the 64 bit hardware. Overall though, it's a fantastic printer, at a great price, and superior manufacturer's support for its products."
2,The perfect printer that fell apart,"I've owned this printer for 4 years, but I have to throw it out now. This is the history:1) When I bought it, I had to re-install printer drivers many times before it worked consistently with Mac OS X.2) After a while, the extra paper tray prevented the printer from printing at all. I had to remove it.3) The networking stopped working. I had to switch to a USB connection.4) The empty paper tray light is blinking despite the tray being full of paper of the correct size, so I can't print at all.This printer had everything I wanted. In reality, I have spent hours troubleshooting it, only to lose functionality one piece at a time. I won't be buying Brother again."
5,Brother Laser Printer with Duplex HL-5250DN,"Installed this laser printer using the supplied CD onto a Macintosh OS X 5.5, and a 4.11 version OS.Networked to a Bonjour wireless setup without difficulty. Works as intended on two MacBook Pros; one G4 and one Intel Duo. Install time using the CD was less then 10 minutes for each computer.Brother HL-5250DN Network Ready Laser Printer with Duplex"
2,Magazine subscription,Do not order this magazine through Amazon. It takes forever to get the subscription started. It is also hard to get in touch with a real person to complain or work toward resolution of the problem.
1,Just another Ashtanga ripoff...,"I have seen both of the Blanchard tapes and they are very much the same except that Marc gets to show off different postures that only he can do.Marc Blanchard is a very able practitioner especially in his backbends.However, people don't understand that not every contortionist should try to be a yoga teacher.The quality of his voice is awful, I am not the first or the last to note that about these tapes.He is trying to be soft,sattvic,yogic,sensual and relaxing and he fails miserably on all counts, he is just irritating.The content of the comments and the quality of instruction is best described by the words vacuous,non existent and inane.If you liked this, try Bryan Kest for more of the same.Or for a change you could look on Amazon for David Swenson's Ashtanga Yoga tapes to find out more about the style Bryan and Marc perverted to eventually reach that synthesis that they now ""teach""."
2,after so many great reviews I expected more.,"I bought this after reading all the good reviews. I did not find the series engaging. Maybe I needed to watch it when I was 12 or less to have found it great and have fond memories if it. After all I once thought Thundercats, were great now with adult eyes I find the characters rather flat and a little snobish. The characters of Zenki are a little flat, not much depth, you never get to see inside there head, probably because all you would find is air. The other annoying thing is the the tranformation of Zenki, it is like watching he-man call on the power or lion-o calling the thundercats, Zenki transforms in every episode and it seems like a long transformation, later they add an axe, and after the first transformation you get to watch the calling on the axe, it just seems so long."
5,Wonderful,Many of the endings are quite satisfying. Your goal is have to become a champion of karate.Master of Karate is one of the most exciting Richard Brightfield books next to Master of Kendo.
4,Not What You May Expect,"Davis and Hersh write interesting, accessible overviews of pertinent social-mathematical topics and provide a respectable bibliography of reference materials. Topics covered include meta thinking, meaning of computation, and mathematical abstraction. If you are looking for information about Descartes, however, as I was, you will find very little of that in this volume."
5,Provides insight,"I read this book over 20 yrs. ago, recommended by a friend who's a first rate mathematician, J. Palmore. I recall 2 things. First, that 'fairness' is not uniquely defined. Nice examples are given. Second, the 5 methods of mathematical proof: (i) proof by reference to the literature, (ii) proof by intimidation (""It's obvious!""), etc. Also recommended: to read in Descartes' memoirs the description of how he came on the idea to invent analytic geometry and derivatives of simple curves."
4,What a way to start!,"This is a brilliant, yet perhaps a little naive beginning to want is becoming a great rock band. Even though they don't show much artist promise on this record, the noisy and rapid feedback of Tim Wheeler's guitar and Mark Hamilton's thumping bass makes for a very entertaining listen. Catchy, youthful euphoria is displayed on tracks like Petrol and the excellent Uncle Pat. If you like this album you will certainly like 1977 and Nu-Clear Sounds. Perhaps one of the most promising bands to evolve from Ireland in recent years."
3,A strong but not stunning beginning,"The US version of this album, initially released when the members of this Northern Ireland rock group were only teengaers, featured a slightly different tracklisting to the UK one, and this is the one I'm reviewing here.As with any young band, sheer younthful exhuberance is at the fore here. Tracks like Day Of the Triffids, Jack Names the Planets and Season bounce along at unabated pace, but as far as I'm concerned the two highlights are the cathcy and memorable Uncle Pat, with slow verses interspersed with a neat guitar line, and Get Out, a 1-and-a-half minute blast of power, certain to clear the cobwebs. Havging these two tracks next to each other is a good demonstrations of the talent for many types of songs, which came to fruition later."
3,OH.....it's Ash,"I've been a fan of Ash since Girl from Mars was released in the UK and got 1977 as soon as I could. Being a naive 13 year old at the time,I didn't know about Trailer and its a shame as I think I'd probably have appreciated it more then. I obtained the album some time after my 15th birthday in 1997 and its simple melodies, rifts and vocals were just enough to keep me happy, and although it gets the odd play on my stereo now and then parts of it make me cringe in the worst possible way. It isn't that Trailer isn't good, its just that, well music has moved on and the innocence of this album is about all that is lovable about it now. 1977 is by far their best album and the addition of Charlotte has strengthed them. If you are a fan of Ash than buy this album, if not then move on to 1977. Trailer is a fun first album, reminiscent of days banging around with your first guitar with a broken 6th string and a beaten up set of drums. It's youth baby!"
3,"Sometimes it's four, sometimes it's two","This cd is brimming with talent; it just isn't organized in the right way. Tracks like 'Different today,' 'Uncle Pat,' and 'Punk Boy' show great songwriting technique. Unfortunately, this can't quite measure up to 1977. Buy this if you are a serious Ash fan."
2,"Nice, but too easy to rip","This item was given to my daughter who is 2 1/2 (note: the product is recommended for above three years old) In any event my daughter enjoyied it, but very quickly tore the rubber holding the bars. It is now quite useless. If you get this product make sure your children are going to be using it very gently or it will not last very long."
2,Nice sound but surprisingly loud,"I would recommend this only for children ages 6 and older. The chimes have a nice sounds when played as an instrument, but when the mallet is just dragged back and forth across the chimes like a younger child does naturally, the sound is shockingly loud -- like referee whistle decibels I'd guess. We quickly needed a rule for our almost-five-year-old: no playing it outside her room."
3,Using In Classroom,I bought this to use in my first grade classroom as an attention getter. That works fine. The foam that covers the chimes tore within a few days and the chimes fall out.
3,Not durable,"This is a great toy for someone who will treat it well. It has a lot of songs and includes music (no music note reading ability required) so you can play along, and the chimes sound really nice. However, within a couple days, my boys (3 and 4) had pulled out the chimes and slowly the bars began falling apart also. They are rather rough with toys, but nevertheless, it would have been nice if it were constructed more durably."
2,Tough Call,"I won't agree with the reviews that call this ""bad music"" -- however, it is very sullen and wistful. It doesn't convey a mood you want to put yourself in very often, and I think that's part of why this album seems less popular than thier others, and the singles from it have faded from radio airplay.I think tracks #5 ""Become (To Tell)"" and #8 ""Bothered"" to me are the standouts. Crunchy, locomotive hard rock, with heavy 1970s-style distortion that you just don't hear musicians attempt much anymore. Get that air guitar out when you play these!But overall, it's an album for fans that want to spend time investigating Candlebox... It takes effort to like this CD."
2,Can we say sophomore slump?,"I wasn't expecting anything mind blowing from Lucy, since following up their amazing debut would have been near impossible. After listening for awhile I've come to a verdict. This album surpassed my expectations - for the worse. This is what they call bad music folks. For the fan who called ""Butterfly"" a masterpiece... you must have the worst musical taste imaginable. I respect everyone's opinion, but come on. How can anything on this album even be considered above average. Simple Lessons is the only decent song, but it still doesn't have half the impact that any of the songs off of their debut had.And for the person arguing that Lucy wasn't a disappointment because it had three music videos, I have news for you. The record company kept ordering videos probably in a desperate attempt to create a buzz about the album... too bad they failed miserably."
2,What A Huge Step In The Wrong Direction!!!,"... I have the first Candlebox album and I absolutely love it. It has 6 great songs ... This album has one good song (Simple Lessons) that reminds me of the first album. The rest of the songs are just noise to me. It's absolutely nothing like the their debut. I have over 3,000 cd's and I have to rate this one within the top 10 worst albums I ever bought. The first is in my top 100. There's a reason this band broke up! They failed to catch that original magic!"
3,It's a CD,"I've had a kick in buying old 90's cds I've never heard recently. Lucy is a decent album, though honestly, there's only one or two gems on it. The first (self-titled) Candlebox album exceeds the greatness of this work by far, showing that almost everyone falls victim to the sophomre curse. It's worth a listen if you find it cheap. I did not buy the remastered version, so that may have a slight bit to do with the slight disatisfaction."
5,I like it.,"I don't understand why ANYBODY could have not liked this album. You have the bluesy solos of Peter Klett, the pounding bass of Bardi Martin, and the great Kevin Martin on vocals. I'll admit these songs wer not as good as on their debut, but at least its a LOT better than the stale, generic ""Happy Pills"". For those who thought this cd had poor sales, it actually went gold with 500,000 copies. So, for all you sell-outs, grow up!"
2,"good recipes, wrong dishes","I am a food consultant from Argentina, and I have to say that a half of the Argentinean recipes from this book are completely wrong or, are not part of our culture...For instance, I never hear about bocaditos or fruit salad with frozen yogurt!A freaking example: submarino. This is a warming winter beverage that we do by placing a bar of chocolate into a cup, then filled with boiling milk (without stirring), and of course this is the reason of the name ""submarine""...in this book this tradicional recipe is made with COLD milk and chocolate syrup.So, I so sad this gastronomic misunderstanding, I don't know what to think about the recipes from another countries."
4,Lyrical language and stunning images,"""When you are born...I promise to help you remember all you have forgotten. I promise the ocean...you will hear the beating of its heart against the shores."" In this lyrical language, A Mother's Promise reminds us of our connection to the earth and of its diverse beauty as a mother makes a series of promises to her unborn child. It also reminds us of our responsibility to the earth...to nurture, love, and take great care of it so that we and future generations can enjoy it. David Danioth's illustrations are soft and gentle and full of warmth and beauty. The images of the mother holding her newborn infant are especially stunning."
2,package only had 5 tattoos,"Buyer Beware, package only had 5 tattoos, For the price I was certainly expecting more, but since it didn't specify I will take the hit this time."
2,Poor Quality,"I ordered 3 flags, one from Quebec, Canada, and France. The flag from Canada was very poor quality. Only single stitching all the way around and very poorly done at that. The one from France I would rate as a 4* and the one from Quebec was excellent. 5* for it because it was stitched very well and was made the best."
5,An inexpensive and durable large flag,My wife needed a big flag she could wrap herself in for a performance and this was perfect for her needs. Easy to clean and durable. Dimensions are exactly as advertised. Not much else to say here.
1,this flag sucks,dont buy this flag it sucks. made in china enough said. all u can do with this flag is pin it to a wall.
1,Canadian Flag 3 feet by 5 feet,The flag has good quality for the four dollar price. It should last two to three months on the pole. I would recommend it to a friend. .................
1,The flag that never arrived,I ordered this product about one month ago now and I still have not received the product. Disappointing. And not trustworthy.
1,Just a horrendously bad and cheap flag...,"Yes it is polyester, but it is shoddily made. My flag has several loose threads, frayed ends, and at some parts, the stitching isn't even throughout.I'm almost too embarassed to even hang this up because it is a disgrace to the great country which is Canada. I guess it serves me right for trying to buy a flag that is cheap and most likely Made in China.I advise my fellow Canadians to not waste their money on this cheap junk and possibly look for a much better flag here or to buy one locally that is made in the country. I have put this flag in my den where it still hangs proudly, but I am disappointed at what I got.Don't be fooled by the ""superknit"" or other words they use. This is an almost transparent, and flimsy flag with poor stitching. At this price, you get what you pay for I guess."
4,Franklin Speller review,"We purchased this item to help my son, who has a disability in the area of written language.It is not a perfect fix because his spelling is so bad that the device cannot always accurately guess the correct word he is searching for. Generally though, the device is quite helpful."
4,Quite pleased!,My husband is not dyslexic but has a very hard time spelling. His new job requires a great deal of emailing and this helps him so much! He just spells the word phonetically and up pops the correct spelling! Awesome!
1,Do NOT buy this product!,"I earned this product from hosting a doTERRA class. After using it about a dozen times, the fan quit working. It produces mist, but the mist cannot be blown out of the machine. It's DEFINITELY not worth $50, and I'm glad I didn't have to pay a penny for it! What a waste!"
2,Pearessence Spa Mist review,"It's very flimsy, hard to keep the top on it. Comes loose from the plug-in jack easily....made very cheap. On a positivenote the colors it produces are pretty."
4,Mister,"I bought this item for my mother who likes scented candles. The oils are necessary for her. The device starts up immediately and certainly spreads the smell around the room. It does have a small water reserve and if it is over filled, the ultrasonics do not work. My mother was happy enough with the unit to send one to each of my sisters for their birthdays."
1,Junk,This item worked great for about 45 days then just stopped. It was too late to get my money back so I have yet another piece of garbage with which to deal. The unit does not give off any mist or turn colors. It is just a lump sitting taking up space. Don't bother buying this. It just isn't worth even $30.
1,Junk!,"I knew when I bought this product not to expect too much because of the low price, but I at least expected it to work! I read the instructions, tried what they advised, sought help from other people's comments about the mister and how they made it eventually work, but no luck. I ended up having to return it and that was the best thing about the whole experience: Amazon's quick, easy, no-nonsense return policy. Skip this product. I have ordered another similar, but slightly different one and will give it one more try before hitting the stores and putting a little bit more money into it."
2,Worked great but broke within a month,"This little humidifier was perfect for my office: good looking, very pleasant with the ambient lights, and dispersing mist sufficiently to humidify a fairly large space. It greatly alleviated dry skin problems in a very dry environment caused by forced air and space heaters. Unfortunately, it wasn't made well and it broke within a month. First, instead of shutting off when water got below the minimum level as it was supposed it, it would sputter and flash making horrible noise. Next, after a couple of weeks, the unit started leaking water from the bottom all over my desk. I returned it."
3,giving it another try,"It is a great idea for adding a little moisture and aromathrerapy into the air. I love it for being able release the eucalyptus oil into the air without having to burn any candles, and it is good if you have any type of respiratory problems. The first time I used it my skin was so dry, and I noticed an immediate improvement after turning it on. I have only used my unit about 5 times and the motor sounds like it's dying and it smells like it's burning. So I am hoping this was a defective one and I am going to try a new one. Hopefully it works, cause when it works, we all really like it."
1,pearlessence spa mister,This idem did not work at all and I was very dissapointed. I decided it was too much trouble to send back and threw it away.debbie
1,Poor Quality,"I'm sorry to give a negative review, but I'm afraid this product deserves it. I ordered the Pearlessence Spa Mist Air and was unpleasantly surprised by the cheap quality of the plastic used to construct this thing. The price was great, but it just wasn't worth it and I returned it. I can't recommend this at all.I've used a different ultrasonic diffuser in the past that was absolutely fantastic! You can see a similar product on amazon by doing a find for the Ultrasonic Misting DIFFUSER by Young Living (which I'm sorry to say is way overpriced). I think there's one Japanese company that makes these units, and then different companies take the units and brand them for themselves. I wish Amazon carried one of these at a reasonable price because I would order one in a heartbeat. They are high quality and work fabulously."
3,Spa Mister,I love the mister. The color changes are nice to watch. The only problem that I have with it is that it does not operate for 8 hours like it says it does. It only operates for around 4 hours and then clicks off. That is false advertising.
2,loved it....when it worked,I bought 2 of these. One for each kids room. They worked for about 5 months and then one stopped and made awful noises. The other united over heated and the water was very hot. Not a reliable unit.
3,Great product....while it works!,"I ordered this and have had it about a month and it is great....when it works. It is now at the point where it will absolutely not turn on, so what I do is set it up, plug it in and sometime during the night it will start. The ""mist"" is perfect and it is great with the lavender oil I use, but I suspect sometime very soon, it will not turn on at all and I will be looking for another option."
3,Didn't last long,"Nice size, pretty lights. However, it stopped working after 6 month....I was too busy taking care of my new born baby and didn't check how the warranty works...."
3,Low capacity,"Essential oils will instantly dissolve the ""fill line"" inside. If you fill too high above this line, not much comes out.This unit will shut off if it is nearly empty with about 1.5 cm of water in the bottom. It holds approximately 200 mL of water and will empty within about two to three hours.It cycles every ~20 seconds through a rainbow of colours. The lid consists of three pieces which is two too many but it does work and the fan is quiet enough.Not bad."
1,greytmom,I recieved my package today. The outer box was crunched. The box the spa mist was in was rattling around the packing box. The spa mist box was opened!!! I pulled the spa mist out and read the directions and set it up to use. Low and behold it flashed on a second and went off. So my mister does not even work!! Was this a returned product?? It was poorly packaged to ship!!
4,good for the price,"My mom got this for me a while back. I used to use it on my nightstand, but I now have a larger one for the bedroom and took this one to my desk at work.PROS:-small size-can be used with lights on or off-provides a decent amount of mist-pretty quiet-looks a lot better than other mini humidifiersCONS:-the little cap with the slit at the top is not connected in any way (to allow for directing the mist), and I lost it when we moved. My temporary solution os to use an open lotion top with one of those slits. Works prety well. You have to have some sort of cap or the mist is too much and everything gets wet.-only one setting, so you can't adjust amount-it has an auto-off when it runs out of water, but it doesn't just shut off, it gurgles and turns on and off quickly for about 10 mins before it really turns off. this usualy wakes me up and i just unplug it.-no 'off' button - you have to unplug."
2,Disappointed,"My husband purchased this for my anniversary gift. I was so excited to use it at first--to play around with different scent combinations, and at first it worked. Then I had a problem with it but figured out that I couldn't use the water from our drinking tap. It has been working fine, but today I plugged it in, and . . . no mist. Seems like the fan isn't working. If I leave the top off, I see mist, but then I get water going everywhere. No mist is blowing from the top. I am really sad. This really seems to be a cut rate item."
3,Good but could be better,"It does a decent job of dispersing scents, but it can only operate for 2-3 hours due to limited water capacity. I would like to find a larger unit that can go all day."
5,Pretty and effective,I gave this spa mister to my sister for her birthday and she loves it. When I was at her house I noticed the subtle but very pleasant spicey scent and commented on it. She told me the wonderful smell was coming from the spa mist machine. It does a great job and the soft color change of the mister makes it pretty as well as useful.
5,item resent!!,"i received product worked well for few days and than stopped! contacted cust service online and they are sending new unit at no charge to me !!! this is how customer service should be and would like to do business w/more co like this also my first review was negative due to being upset that i didnt get reponce as fastas i wanted,but co took care of issue no problem !!! thank you very much Dan in N.J."
1,Mine broke too!,"I used this product for about 6 months. It's worked well as a diffuser. Don't expect it to be a vaporizer, because it's not. The moisture it adds to the air is an added bonus, but not what it's built for. However, after about 6 months it just stopped working. It thought mine was as isolated incident, but after reading the other reviews, it seems to be a pattern."
1,love it but it doesn't last,"I love this item. It's small and fits on a desktop. It's my favorite way to diffuse essential oils. I've followed all the instructions for maintenance and cleaning but have had 2 units stop working in the last 6 months.I can't recommend this item because it doesn't work past the first month or so, from my experience."
2,The Spa Mister Broke After Two Weeks,"It worked really well for the first two weeks, then quit powering on. I was using it every day. I followed the instructions for cleaning and filling. It was very disappointing when the unit stopped powering on after two weeks. I have returned it and am looking for a more durable model. (Amazon is very good about allowing items like this to be returned.) :)"
1,Didn't Work !,"Me and my mother each bought one of these. And one of them worked for 1 day, and the other didn't work at all. My mom took her's back to GNC where it was purchased. And got another one...got it home plugged it in and it didn't work. I took mine back and got another and it worked again for maybe 2 days and then did not work at all.I called the company, left a message with someone to call me back and never got any response. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME !"
1,Not worth the trouble,"I purchased this item for its ease and simplicity and the cost was reasonable as well. I looked forward to having this product in my home spa. I received the item and set it up for first use, it took awhile to get started. I thought it was just the way it worked as the instructions were minimal. The next day I started it up again, and to my dismay it never started. I tried a couple more times to no avail. So I thought that the item I received was defective. I let Amazon know and they promptly shipped me a new one. To my utter dismay the new one performed exactly as the first one! I returned this one for a refund. I was frustrated with my experience and will not purchase items from this manufacturer again."
1,not what I expected,"This spa mist is not what I expected, the water did not last long and neither did the fragrance.It was disappointing.Do not recommend"
1,Not a lot of bang for your buck,The colored lights are nice but that's about the only good I could see from this product. It puts out very little mist and there was no aroma at all from the drops of essential oil I put in. The only place you might get some benefit from it would be in a very small bathroom or closet. I thought it would be great for our motorhome but was sadly disappointed.
2,Cheap Product,Very cheap (plastic) product. (You get what you pay for I suppose). I will be spending the money for a better product.
5,Healthy Gadget,"This mister is quick and easy to fill and clean. Compact size and the funky color changes makes it fun. As long as you clean it out after each use when you use essential oils, it's a cool mist so should give you all the health benefits of any oil you choose. I love it and well worth the price!"
4,"Love it, but motor starting to go...","I have used this for over a year, and love it. It adds minimal moisture to the air, but does a great job dispersing essential oils. While this is meant for a small room, I use it in our family room which is fairly large and it still scents the whole area. The colors are mesmerizing and my children love watching them change, but the motor in the bottom that turns the color wheels is starting to go, causing some terrible grinding sounds. This is sporadic, but a sure sign the motor will quit soon. The motor can be turned off and the unit still produces mist, but without the pretty colors. When the motor does quit, I will buy another one because I think it's reasonable for the motor to be wearing out after the amount of use this has had."
4,"I love it, but one problem!","I have had this item for about a year and love this it, but there is just one problem with it. It works great with the oils, but if you like to change your scent constantly - I always find you can't truly get rid of the scent of the last oil you used."
2,"cheap, arrived broken","As other reviews have noted, this is a low quality item and not worth the price - cheap plastic parts. It arrived broken as well - you could only run it with the lights blinking, not as advertised with a lights off setting as well. I'm sending it back!"
1,Junk,Sent it back right away. Doesn't last - you have to keep filling it up- I was looking for something that would turn on and off periodically to keep a nice aroma filled room.
1,Disappointed,"I was excited to receive, but when I plugged it in, it operated for about a minute, then quit. Unplugged and tried again, only a couple of seconds this time. Tried again, no response, gave up."
3,Mister,"I have never used a mister like this before. The lights changing is very pretty and restful. When it is misting it works great. I don't actually see the mist though unless I look for it. I have trouble with having to clean it a lot. I use water from our well which is goes through a conditioner system. Bottled water may be less of a problem. Also, it doesn't hold much water so if you run it a lot you have to add water quite frequently, therefore clean quite frequently. Using oils in this is very nice. I'm not sure if I would buy another one like this or not. The principle is great however."
4,Useful on my desk,"I wanted to get a unit ever since I saw it at a Health food store. But the price was a little high for such a unit. Luckily yesterday I found it on sale for much less at GNC $19.99.I have it turned on while it sits on my home office desk sans light show and also added about 5 drops of Vanilla essential oil. It does the job. However, as others have mentioned, it does have a fairly audible humming sound. As for humidfying properties, I don't know how well it will do. It is after all sitting on my desk and misting towards me during the day. If I were looking for something to humidify a bigger room I would definitley consider get a better unit solely for humidifying purposes and also consider getting a warm mist humidifier.Would I buy this unit again? At the lower price yes! It would be a great gift for some one as well to use in their office. Would I buy it at full price for $30? No way...."
3,The Landing Space Ship -an update,"This is at least what my husband calls it. And I must admit I find it to be rather odd and I'm disappointed in the product.The humidifier has a rather loud hum.The lights rather than soothing to me are rather garish (good news is you can turn the lights off)Okay that is the bad sideIt does an excellent job of dispersing scent. It also has lasted longer than the electric ceramic oil warmers( Pearlessence Mistifier Ceramic Burner, Orange ) I have owned.update 9/23/2009I have owned this for almost a year now.1. still working great2. as noted in other reviews if you fill to high it does not work (and the red fill line tends to wear off from the essential oils)3. works well for small spaces without over powering themThe more I use it the more I like it and it is still working while other diffusers have stopped working."
3,???,"The over all quality of this Mister is some what poor. Very sensitive water level and will not start up if level is not just right. Water runs out very quickly as it is only one cup size. The lid is knocked off easily. Does have nice soothing mist sound, for me like a white noise. And have enjoyed the changing color mode and adding scent oils are so relaxing. I am still using after a year in the dry winter months for sinuses, but only for it's compact size for traveling. Have since gotten solid quality and larger for everyday use."
1,Not worth it,"I had to return the item because besides looking real cheap (silver painted plastic top, plastic container, the water level mark is just a red line made with marker, and not even a permanent one, so it disappears after an hour) it worked only sporadically. It misted for some time, then stopped. When shaking the unit or unplugging and reconnecting, it might start misting again. The output is so low that the great lavender oil I bought was almost not noticeable. The only thing that worked flawless was the color changing lights. I now use the aromatherapy oils in my warm mist humidifier and the results are so much better.Amazon's return policy is really great! I was prepared to pay for shipping but they provide you with a prepaid label to return items. Thumbs up!!!"
4,"Cheap little unit, but it works","This product does exactly what it's supposed to do-- diffuses mist (and essential oil) into the air, quietly and cleanly. However, I was disappointed in several ways. The shipping time was horrendous-- it took nine days to receive this product direct from Amazon. The plastic and styling is cheap and tawdry, and looks like something you'd buy at Dollar General. There also seems to be a design flaw; whenever I clean the unit, then start it up again, the colored light feature automatically runs for the next hour or so, whether it's on or off. But, if you're willing to overlook the design and the flaws, it's a decent little diffuser for the money."
3,Worked for a while,"I had this unit for a while and it workrd great. Then this week I unpluged it from the base and it will not work now.I am going to clean it and see if this helps. If not, it goes into the trash."
4,Excellent when toasted,"I purchased this milk from the UK. It arrived only 4 days after ordering, which was impressive. I was really looking forward to it, as it's not something readily available this side of the Atlantic since cow rationing was introduced following the Mad Cow problem.I used most of the contents up in the first evening, slicing it thickly and lightly frying on either side with garlic infused olive oil; served with cranberry sauce it was superb. The rest I used at breakfast, toasting it in place of my normal wholemeal.Overall, I can recommend this product, though I would not suggest its use to the elderly, particularly users of false teeth."
2,Its the heat that gets you,"WOO, I got my milk 9 days after I ordered it and boy was it rank. The UPS guy was very upset, and my captain crunch went dry. Next time I skip the middle man and get my milk from the source.Dry and crunchy, TX"
3,Humans are so weird,I can't believe you people still consume fluid from the teats of farm animals. This is the 21st damn century already!
2,Prof Panash strikes again,"Prof. Panash says,""Wheres the rest of that wig in my milk. ""......^.........../.,\........|¿|...../\/ \/ \/\./\.\..../. /\.||..\. /...||...|....... |..,,| _/\ _ |,,"

1,Save the Earth ! Avoid Tuscan Whole Milk! it is one of the main source to global warming !,"A by-product of consuming Tuscan Whole Mlik is excessive generation of Methane, which is one of the major reasons for the hole in the Ozone layer ! the hole is the ozone is the main source for global warming !!! save the earth !"
3,Would like to introduce Tucson milk!,"I'm not sure what the people at Tuscan might say, but I would like to introduce my own brand, ""Tucson Milk!"" This will be very similar to Tuscan milk, but mine will be ""Tucson Milk!"" Of course our labels will be quite different (mine will have a yellow label, with multiple cow-jumpings) (and a cactus). Our mooto (milk company talk for motto) will be, ""We're just about like Tuscan Milk!"" The milk itself will also be white. And flavor-full. I hope to sell my Tucson Milk at all gas stations. Our milk will be well-received by all people of Lappish descent. Please look for it next time you fill up!"
1,This milk is NSFW.,"Sorry, but you should have tagged it. I was watching this milk at my workplace when my boss spotted me. I was almost fired. Downvoted."
3,Looking For Used,"I was disappointed because I was hoping to pick up some used Tuscan Whole Milk for few less bucks. Maybe I will buy a new one, take couple of drinks, and then offer it as ""used""."
3,"Same old, crummy old","Is this the brand used to maintain the Milky Way? If the answer is yes, then the agency responsible for the upkeep should really consider switching to a brand that offers a wider variety of options. To begin with, these days with all the pollution (from simple air pollution to light pollution, not to mention all those asteroids and cosmic rays) you might as well call it the Murky Way. Second, it would be nice to be able to switch colors once in a while, say maybe have some pastels or neons, and maybe even consider major holiday themes into the equation (think Empire State Building)."
1,MILK APOCALYPSE,"I admit, I was fooled by the overwhelming positive reviews, but upon receiving the milk, my world fell apart. The jug seemed normal on the outside, so I opened it with glee. As soon as I did, a loathsome stench struck my nostrils. It was so overpowering that I lost consciousness. When I awoke, I was in hell. The milk is a portal to hell! Devils were all around me, dancing and singing a tune macabre. They brandished their pitchforks fiercely, and all I could do was curl up and cry. Satan then appeared to me, and explained that he was going to take the Earth for himself, using the milk. Please, don't buy it! Don't facilitate the apocalypse!"
5,It's breathtaking,"All I ever wanted when I was a wee little boy was a nice gallon of whole milk...all of my own. When I grew up, my brothers and I had to share a gallon of milk. Sometimes, company would come over and we'd run out of milk. Then we'd have to eat our cereal dry, like complete animals.I worked two jobs to put myself through Dairy College so that I'd never again be dependent on someone else to put milk on my table. You can imagine the joy in my soul to know that I can order milk via credit card and have it sent to me via UPS ground! That's the best way to get the milk. You can take your dairy farms and your grocery stores. I want my milk brought to me by a man in a big brown truck with short brown pants."
5,Nectar of the Gods,"Has there ever been a liquid as divine as thee, Tuscan Whole Milk? Your sensuality defies logic, caressing my throat as you tumble to my tummy, filling me with a sense of purpose, and calcium. Remember when you saved my life, Tuscan Whole Milk, at the lake during the summer of '79? I was swimming too far out, the current took me under, I scrambled and flailed beneath the surface. You were there, Tuscan Whole Milk, there to bring me above water, holding me tight in your grasp, pulling me to shore. We collapsed on the shore, letting the sand invade our bodies. And in that moment under the brilliant sun, I drank you, Tuscan Whole Milk. I took you into my body and let you tantalize my senses.Then we played Uno."
5,"OMFG, N64 INCLUDED","I got this milk for Christmas, it was teh best milk ever, I drank it and an N64 appeared. Along with a video game, and a remote control car. The N64 has made all of my dreams wet, thanks to Tuscan Whole Milk. I would have been drunk in a ditch if not for Tuscan Whole Milk! When you drink it be aware, there are Hobos after Tuscan Whole Milk.-OMG-The wrapping paper came off like a dream sequence.--------Nintendo 64!!!!!!111111111111Tuscan Whole Milk tastes like cow milk only better, because of the N6411111!!!!!!!"
3,The war....the war....,"So I decided to make my purchase about a week or so ago. I was young and willing. Ready to try new things and accomplish new feats. Milk was on that list undoubtedly.When I brought it back home, it sat there on my counter. Almost with a grimace upon its face. This was the milk's challenge to me. He was saying, ""C'mon, drink me. You won't, you wont."" I surely denied his assumed accusation. ""But I will, this is your purpose here. I shall not be taking such criticism from a loathe of a gallon such as yourself.""After sometime the acid wore off. I woke up covered in sweat. I remembered that gallon still sat in my kitchen, questioning...instigating. Then it hit me. It was him....the one....my mother warned me about...Why here? Why now? This is how it will be?Part 2 coming soon."
3,Weary of paying full price.,"I tried the Tuscan Chocolate Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. It was ""good"", but not ""45-dollars"" good.This time I'll wait until someone's selling a used copy."
3,Saving up for a gallon of my own...,"I'm not a milk snob, but I must admit that I've had better, but at a much higher cost however. Honestly, my budget does not permit me to afford the luxury of milks in this class too often, but for this balance of flavor and price, I will save up my pennies. My friend, a true lacto-connoisseur introduced me to this milk the same night she introduced me to Norwegian long milk, and I must admit this was a true pleasure (the long milk made me sick). I saved a portion of this milk in my goblet for dipping the authentic Oreo dessert cookie she offered after dinner... DIVINE!! If you can afford this fine cow juice on a daily basis, you should get a good security system :) I'm stingy with my star ratings, saving fives for very rare products, so don't be put off by 3. Try this if you can, or share the cost with friends and have a milk dinner. Enjoy!"
1,Jerk!,"This milk is a total jerk! He said he would call, but he didn't. And I let him put his hand down my pants and everything. I hate milk. I don't need milk. I have my cat and Seinfeld re-runs on TBS. That's all I need. I'm never going out with milk again."
2,"Parents, take a closer look first!","After reading great reviews of this product online, I ordered a Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. for my kid thinking it would make a great birthday present. You're lucky you didn't have to see the pained look on Oliver's face when he got it in the mail yesterday. Apparently, Tuscan doesn't do a good job at making a clear difference between it's whole and 2% models. ""Dad, now all the kids are gonna make fun of me 'cause I'm drinking whole."" Thanks to Amazon for recently posting multiple views of this product online. I hope it helps parents out there when trying to keep up with what's popular these days."
5,OUTSTANDING in a beer dispenser hat,"At first, I totally hated the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz size because it will not fit inside myFabric Waist Pack Many Colors!.Then it hit me...DUH...pour it into my Adults' Beer Mug Hat. I swear, it was a true afternoon delight sipping its rich, creamy, whole-milkiness as I strolled the aisles of the largest flea market West of the Mississippi on a sweltering hot August Saturday.Two thumbs....WAY UP."
3,Best to Order with a side of manure,"Since 1918 Tuscan Dairy Farms have been delivering dairy products.At first they delivered their products door to door.And then throughout New Jersey and New York, to the rich and the poor.Then someone got the bright idea to sell their fresh milk on the Internet.Additional financial success was included in their bet.Straight from the farms all the containers were set.Then for human consumption and maybe for your pet.For the milk to remain fresh, they hoped.For thousands to drink they doped.As a bonus to get more customers for sure.Soon they will sent this milk with a side of manure."
5,Cheapes mail bride ever!,"I'd been looking all over the internet for a cheap mail order bride, and the chepeast I had fopund was somewhere between $6 and $7, not bad, but when you compare it to the value I got here there really is no comparison.Tuscan Whole Milk didn't save my marriage, it gave me one!"
2,Milking it for all it's worth,"I laughed, I cried... then I realized I diluted my milk...Ah, cruel fate how you smite me and my jus de moo..."
1,Danger!,"Do not use Tuscan milk. Tuscan milk contains extremely high levels of dihydrogen monoxide. Dihydrogen monoxide is the primary component of acid rain and is responsible for the overwhelming majority of drowning deaths, especially among children, women, and the elderly. Most damning, research suggests there is a 100% correlation between the development of a number of cancers with the ingestion of dihydrogen monoxide -- if you have cancer, it is virtually certain that dihydrogen monoxide has entered your bodily system. Tuscan milk does not warn its users about this dangerous chemical, because the ""big milk"" lobby has successfully strongarmed the FDA into exempting dihydrogen monoxide from the list of reportable carcinogens. Please, help spread the word about dihydrogen monoxide, and about Tuscan milk!"
4,$77.76?,"$77.76 for a jug of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz? First, the milk does not glow in the dark as rumored. When you pour it on the floor it just sits there and does not ooze back into the jug on its own. I even cried, nothing, milk was still spilled. So much for this ""technological wonder milk"". Taste test? Don't get me started. At best it came close to some of the $47.93 per gallon stuff that you can get from any traveling milk salesman. Next time I will just by some used Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz from one of the fine alternate amazon sellers. The used stuff is probably broken in, so I will not need to baby it."
3,It's good but has some flaws.,"First, it's nutritious. It has that going for it. But what troubles me are the features. For instance when I tried installing it Windows did not recognize it and I had to scour the internet just to look for a hacked together driver. [...]if you ask me. Next the apparent limitation on the UI. It's a liquid and that's all it can be. The only time you get a solid is if you leave it out for a while but then it's no longer nutritious and is actually unsafe. This is right up there with the exploding Dell laptops. No love for those people who'd rather eat their milk. Next is the apparent lack of an obvious plug-in system. Yes, you can add chocolate syrup or powder to it, but you have to find that out for yourself. This thing does not come with a manual! Outrageous! But I guess that's the trend these days. At least it could have come with a CD with the PDF of the manual for it. It's good for dry cereal. But dry cereal sometimes come with CDs in the box."
3,"Thanks, Amazon!","Amazon's related product recommendations were spot on. I picked up a geiger counter and some uranium ore at the same time I bought my $48 gallon of milk. All i need now is some folk music from Cherynoble.I gave the milk three stars, however, because they don't offer a glow-in-the-dark option."
1,Seriously misleading,"Doesn't taste a darn thing like a Toucan. I thought ""whoa, tropical bird flavor"". Boy was I wrong. Returning this immediately."
5,Resurrection,"It made sense to me to try and replace my dog's blood with Tuscan Whole Milk. I assumed it would give him superpowers. It did not. Instead, my dog went into a serious of violently horrific spasms which literally tore him apart at the seams.Forlorn and standing in a room laden with gore, I began picking up the bits of my poor dog. To ease my pain, I poured a glass of Tuscan Whole Milk. I raised the elixir to my lips and swallowed rich ropes of milky majesty.And Lo! I did spill the slightest drop - it leapt forth from my lips as if under divine control. The wayward milk found it's destination, a bit of my deceased dog. Immediately, from a tiny, bloody scrap of canine, my beloved hound sprang back into existence and back into my loving arms.Thank you Tuscan Whole Milk!"
1,"Easy Install, But Runs Out of Mllk Quickly","Installation was very easy--thank God, because there is no user guide or instructions. That means you'll be left in the dark when it comes to practical application--can I use this in my cereal, bake with it, or make it part of an exotic alcoholic beverage? Who knows. The ""good folks"" at TUSCAN MILK refuse to respond to my e-mails, and when I call tech support I get some guy in India who hangs up on me. Another thing was that after a week it was gone, and what good is an expensive plastic jug? Sure I could buy another gallon and re-fill my original plastic jug, but TUSCON MILK is so expensive--ounce for ounce it's as expensive as a fine perfume. I might as well buy Joy perfume and drink that, that's how expensive this stuff is."
1,Get the Kindle version instead,This milk was spoiled by the time it arrived. The Kindle version gets delivered quicker. Buy that instead.
3,Bad usability,"There are no instructions on opening the bottle. I had to throw mine away, the 800-number listed on the bottle unfortunately doesn't offer options on opening the bottle."
1,Milk of Gold,"I bought Tucson Whole Milk after hearing legends of its glory, tales of its majesty, and how delicious it is. I poured a bowl of frosted mini wheats and eagerly opened the ring seal of the Milk. A sweet smell of other worlds erupted from the biodegradable plastic container. As I poured the pure white liquid onto my cereal, my mouth water with anticipation. A golden glow filled my bowl and I took a single mini-wheat in my spoon and put it in my mouth. I bit down, only to crack two teeth. It turns out that Tucson Whole Milk had transmuted my cereal to pure gold.One star, I was looking forward to that cereal. Bad Tucson Whole Milk! Do not buy, ruins perfectly good breakfasts."
3,East Coast vs. West Coast Milk,"For a majority of my life I have prided myself on my ability to spot a good deal on used whole milk throughout the East Coast. I felt that East Coast milk was a good bargain for used whole milk, and it was also very tasty. However, in recent months due to unforseen circumstances not limited to famine and natural disasters, the supply of used milk on the East Coast has diminished drastically. With this decrease in supply and demand holding contast, naturally, the prices of East Coast used whole milk have shot through the roof.Down on my luck and out of money to buy East Coast whole milk I took to amazon to search for some deals. A few weeks ago I bought about 5 gallons of the Tuscan (West Coast) used whole milk and almost immediately felt the positive effects of this Tuscan used whole milk. I am still waiting for the first shipment, but it's official, I have converted to Tuscan used whole milk!!!!"
1,Milk Pictures,All I have to say is THANK GOD there are three different pictures to view of the milk above. I never would have known what a gallon of milk looks like without you Tucson. You saved my life !!!!!!!!!!!!
3,That's a lot of reviews! It must be good.,"I was looking for milk on Amazon, and this just caught my eye. It looked good. Darned good. But the price. $45.00 for 1 gallon, 128 fl oz? That's over $0.35 per fl oz. That's a lot. It just didn't add up. So, I did some checking. On Google. And I found it - Tuscan milk. 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. $22.50. Looked good. Then I realized. It was Tuscan Half Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. Still, only half the fat and calories, but all the taste. I'd pay twice as much for that. Two and one-half stars. What the heck - make it three."
3,Don't believe the hype!,"You'd think that by reading these reviews, that you'd be witnessing the coming of a supreme being! It's milk, not a miracle.Although I did see a vision of Bob Dylan after drinking this, I believe it was because I wasn't paying attention and drank it two weeks past the expiration date. Chalk it up to a bad jug. That and it doesn't keep well at all in a closet, even out of direct sunlight. This Tuscan Milk requires an electrical device called a ""fridge"" or an ""icebox"", which is normally full of Summit beer, so that's not an option.Actually, Bob Dylan rules."
5,Tuscan Milk... Italian cows?,"I was just wandering if your cows are italian. If so, do they Moo diffirently / have a funny accent?"
2,Stick to Gasoline,"As gas prices rise close to $4 in my area, I have begun my search for alternatives. Being eco-friendly, I tried this product as a carbon-neutral, renewable, non-petroleum based, earth-loving gas substitute. I am absolutely outraged that my Hummer's mileage dropped to near zero and began foul-smelling backfires. I have now decided not to use it in my Gulfstream jet either. Until they get the bugs out of this fuel I will not buy the product again."
2,"1%? Is it because you are fat, because you are.","While I enjoy white high protein fluids, this is way too much fat. I felt like I was drinking cream, and regretted reasoning to myself that my one hour work out would burn off any calories I got from this. I believe the best way to enjoy this gallon of milk is to walk down the street shirtless and walk up to a group of friends and dump the milk all over your body as you wiggle a little bit and scream ""Ahhh-refreshing"". Make sure to let the rivelets of milk trickle down your formless untone body, blame this milk. This is how you will earn the title of being a ""Fruit Salad Head""."
4,Tuscany Dead. Good for your head!,"I remember back in '87 when these only came in 14 oz bags. We would sip them on the curbside and drink them with cheese curdles. It was black and white back then, everything was. I would give them five stars but I heard them in '85 with Bob Dylan and it was a much better show."
4,Effective invasive growth management,"It kills kudzu. Dead, root and all. I tried it on the poison ivy today, and the squirrel that eats one bite out of all of my tomatoes and then figures out, once again, that it doesn't like tomatoes. Them two are a bit tougher and definitely more native than kudzu, though. But if Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, can resolve those pesky infestations in the next few days, I'll next apply liberally to Japanese privet and my neighbor, the timeless wonder who doesn't realize that his guitar doesn't sound a bit better at 3 AM. And if it can take care of those prickly problems, the chickweed and endlessly yapping ankle-biting chihuahua next door should be nothing. Apply as directed, and dispose of the empty container carefully."
1,the whiteness of the milk,"Melville put his finger on it: ""This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.""...or milk!"
3,half gallon is all you need,"with something this rich, i find that a gallon is really overkill. I decided to go with the ""buy it used"" option. I now have just enough tuscan for my budget."
1,Never Again,"A poured a glass of this shortly after it arrived and found what I believe to be several nose hairs floating in it. Gosh, I hope they were just nose hairs!"
1,"Great taste, painful finish","MMMM, milk is so good, but then it makes me hurt because I am lactose intolerant. I HATE YOU, MILK!"
3,???? I don't get it.,How can anyone make an educated decision to buy Tuscan Whole Milk when it only has 737 reviews?
1,Mmm Mmm Good!,"This product gave me diarrhea. My brother got cholera, my mom got the measles and my sister broke her arm. Soon after, we lost a wagon wheel and a thief stole 3 oxen."
1,Spoils if left out,"It's good milk if you drink it right away, but I'm only giving it one star because it spoiled when I left it out the the counter when I went away for the weekend. They really should put this in the description. I've bought a lot of products from Amazon (books, CD's, etc.) and I've never had this problem with anything else."
1,I love me some milk,"When I saw this item on Amazon I knew that I had to get me some. You see, I am lactose intolerant and am always looking to try rare milk brands to see if they make my intolerance tolerable. I took one sip of this Tuscan Whole Mile, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and felt the silkiness slide down my throat, WOW. I have to give this one star because I could not help myself but to finish the gallon and went through two whole boxes of Lactaid in the process, which made my ""investment"" $64 instead of a mere $44. I would buy Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, Lactose Free if it was offered."
3,Sub zero is now plain zero,"Dis milk vould probably be great but I vouldn't knowah because dese discipline lackuz keep stealing my cookies! And dey drink my milk tooah! I say put da cookie down NOW and dey do not comply! Soah I try to steal a crate full of dis vonduhful Tuscan milk product and bring it to my laiyuh, but eet does not hold up unduh sub zero temputuhz! Da milk is just plain zero! Come on, do youah think dat Santa's milk freezes at da Nawth Pole? Negateeve! But dat is probably because his minions do not lack discipline and dey sing da cold meisuh song vhen he tells dem tooah! DOWOWOW!- Mistuh Freeze"
2,With the cost of gas....,"Warning! This does not work for your car!!! Please do not pour into your gas tank (diesel might be fine). I have been trying to find alternative energy sources that were good for the environment, but this does not work! Given the risks of gas prices, I decided to stock up on gallons of milk for my gas customers, and so far they are uniformly disattisfied!Now I am threatened with Lawsuits for the destoyed cars, AND - since the cost of milk exceeds what I can charge for 93 Octane, I have lost money on every gallon!Not recommended as engine coolent, either. I have tried it an environmentally sound weed killer, but the results are still to be determined."
3,An Illusion?,"Of course, we are here reminded of Wordsworth's ""obstinate questionings of sense and outward things""; of his ""misgivings of a creature moving about in worlds not realised."" Intuition is feeling its way outwards beyond the sphere of the known, and emotion is working in harmony with it, the reason still fails to grip."
1,No!,"I ordered the milk online as any modern man as myself would, and two days later I heard a knock at the door. I rushed to the threshold to behold the cold delicious beverage that awaited me, with my eight-year-old daughter trailing behind with the utmost excitement in her eyes. I opened the door the witness that white, breathtaking goodness in the hands of the milkman, but as my eyes shifted upward from the milk and to the face of the milkman, I realized that it was none other than Brian Peppers. I could see the look of desire in his eyes as he stared at my daughter. Holding the milk he ran inside, chasing after her, and to rid himself of excess weight in this pursuit he tossed the milk into the air - at this point I screamed, ""Brian, NO!!!!!!"", but the milk crashed the floor in a massive lactose explosion. I'll never forgive Amazon for allowing Brian Peppers to use his deceptive techniques to get into the homes of father like me. Damn you, Brian."
1,disappointing,"As a longtime fan of milk, I was beside myself with excitement when I heard that a new, definitive edition was coming out. Sadly, it's a disappointment. The remastering sounds rather cold to my ears, the liberal use of noise reduction has stripped away much of the high end frequencies and room ambience, and the bonus tracks are nothing more than alternate mixes of previously released material. They should've licensed the masters to Rhino; then we'd finally have the ultimate milk experience we were promised. Oh well, maybe one day."
3,Greetings from 2525,"I have been drinking Tuscan whole milk, 1imperial gallon, 356.8 flonauts since the early part of '24. No fascinating events occurred, no bolt of lightning, no sudden bleeding stigmata. Then yesterday, I accidentally spill some Tuscan whole milk out of my gravbowl of Soylent Red, which drips down my vapor mask and onto my The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee, and here I am.I can't belive people still procreate like you do, but the trees are nice."
1,I ordered new but got used,I got this because I heard wonderful reviews about it but the milk I got was clearly used. Not pleased.
2,too much bang for the buck,"first of all, we bought this product with the foresight to realise that our 10 month old would want milk at some point. a WEEK later, after many, many tears, we got the product and gave little jimmie a big bottle of ""the tuscan"" None of us were ready for what came next.no more than 15 seconds after his first sip his lips turned purple and his eyes turned red. a licensed exorsist, i immediately ran to fetch my exorsism kit, but by the time i got the holy water out, little jimmie had my wife over his head ready to throw. i splashed some holy water on him, but that seemed to make it worse. As my wife went through the window, little jimmie tossed the coffee table at me, hitting me square in the head.i woke up to find the house trashed, my wife with a shattered pelvis, and the kid no where in site...would have given it one star but for the fact that i've slept much better ever since..."
2,made me fat,"yea, i'm not kidding. be careful how much of this whole milk you take in. i ordered 8 gallons of this stuff and it lasted me 2 and half days. i gained just over 23 pounds in those few days. not recommended."
1,Irresponsible product!,"From the World Wildlife Fund: ""Illegal ivory markets are having a direct impact on elephant populations, particularly in west and central Africa. Consumers need to realize the true cost of buying ivory is poached elephants."" That said, buying milk made from ground up ivory, this tusken milk, is morally reprehensible."
2,Don't be fooled by fancy labels!,"This is exactly the same product sold nationally as ""Tucson Whole Milk"" for half as much money. It comes from the same cows, is processed in the same facility, and is in every respect identical to the lower-priced brand. All they did was give it a foofy name and jack up the price.Be a smart shopper! Save your money and buy Tucson Whole Milk instead. With all that extra cash in your pocket, you'll finally be able to afford the ""Reykjavik Orchards Organic Orange Juice"" you've always wanted."
1,it was like this.....,"I got married. It didn't work out. I got a divorce. I dated around. I met a girl. I got married again. She got pregnant. We had a baby. A REAL baby! This baby existed, damn it! I swear to God.But....lo & behold, my wife ordered this damn Tuscan milk, thinking we were giving our baby a little extra special treat.....and poof......baby up in smoke. There one minute, gone the next.I mean, what do you do? We got the birth records to prove it. Ask Stephen Spielberg... he was here. He saw her!Everyone wants to make it out like she never existed. I'm telling you it was human spontaneous combustion. That's it! What else would you call it?Tom Cruise"
3,Is it even cow milk?,"Although there is a cow pictured on the label, nowhere on the label does it actually say this this milk even comes from cows. Lots of animals have milk.If this came from cows, don't you think they would actually mention this somewhere? This milk comes from New York City, and they are quite tricky over there..."
4,I am emotionally dependent on this milk.,"It's there for me, you know... when I'm depressed or sad. Or when I've had a bad day at work. I just come home and open the fridge and there it is, waiting for me. Waiting to take the pain of life away. Cool, refreshing milk. Easing the crushing weight of modern life."
3,Calcium the Old-Fashioned Way,"The milk was OK, though I must admit I bought it used. I can't imagine buying it new, let alone the collector's version---NIB (New, In Bottle) and signed by the cow. But maybe there's a difference in the taste. Also, the standard shipping (7-14 days) put it slightly past the expiration date."
1,Dolphin milk is better than this milk,"The best authority on milk is the website milk dot com. It is higher in fat content and also the process of milking a dolphin is a lot more humane. For years I have been drinking dolphin milk. See for yourself... As Amazon won't let me link outside of this site, do a google search for dolphin milk pooper, the first result is all the evidence you need to know that this milk is nothing compared to the best."
3,Hard to get unbundled,"These are so hard to find. They're the spring season's Nintendo Wii. When I went to Walmart to get some, I had to get it in a huge bundle that included 25 different kinds of cheese, 3 bottles of Nestle's Quik, a set of six glasses, a bag of Oreos, and a big glass pitcher."
5,A MILLION LITTLE PIECES OF HISTORY,"I have really enjoyed these ""reviews"" of Tuscan Milk.Am I the only one who remembers this article from New York Magazine twenty years ago?DAIRYMAN AND THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESSIn 1986 a subway train, a cross-town L going east, jumped the rails a quarter mile past the 8th Avenue and 14th Street station. Plowing into the wall just far enough to crush a pipe that had been capped off during construction 80 years earlier. Rushing to assist the injured was passenger Beyer Tuscan, proprietor of Tuscan Milk of Brooklyn. Wading into the mélange of bodies and beverage, Beyer couldn't help but notice the familiar liquid surrounding him. Milk.Long forgotten, this was one of Manhattans famous ""milk pipes"" a relic of Dutch dairy farms from the 1700's....The article goes on to relate the failure of the milk pipe system, but I marvel at the luck of the Tuscan Milk family, you can't buy PR like this!"
1,Very disappointing indeed!,My local Priest told me that this milk would enlarge my Willie Johnson to Biblical proportions. Not funny. Now I have to have four bodybuilders carry it around for me. This milk has ruined my life. And my wife. DO NOT DRINK THIS!
1,Please shop responsibly and avoid this product,"I'm aware that serving Tuscan Whole Milk has acquired a certain cachet among gourmet types. But please remember that the Tuscan women who are selling their breast milk to furnish the supply are desperately impoverished people vulnerable to the most ruthless kind of exploitation from the international dairy megaconglomerates. As a result, an entire generation of Tuscan children is now facing chronic malnourishment - according to a recent UNICEF report. If you simply must add that special tang to your mocha espresso, please seek out Fair Trade-certified breast milk instead - preferably from a local supplier."
1,Not as good as Nunchucks,"If you have no weapons, I don't recommend Tuscan Milk. Instead, I recommend getting a set of nunchucks or a club. A broom stick or a brick are good too. If you can't find anything at all, you can buy the book Combat Without Weapons available on Amazon. Tuscan Milk does not work well as a weapon because it is hard to swing and difficult to throw. It also can't be used to stop any bullets. I read on a website that it can stop a knife, once. That's not really worth it to me. Unless you are attacked by cats, and need a distraction, you probably don't need Tuscan Milk. I wish someone had written a review like this before I bought the milk. I hope this review is helpful."
1,Milk makes my arse explode.,"Stay away from this stuff. If you're like me, you'll pay for it later when you're paintin' the bowl. :) More like Tuscan arse-buster.."
3,Do not feed Tucsan Whole Milk to your cat!,"I purchased THM to feed my cat and now he has been projectile shitting for three days. I don't know what to do. Houdini (my cat) is clearly in distress. He won't look at me and every time I touch him he poops streams of gooey caramel. His box is a mess, my couch is a mess, my bed smells awful. Should I stop feeding him Tuscan Whole Milk, or will he develop a tolerance? Help!"
1,Never felt so passionate. Seriously,"So, it all started one day. I mean, I was just walking down the street, drinking a little miller highlife. I decided""What the hell"" I'll go purcahse some of this great milk! So as you know... I ran for joy. I mean, like I have already said. I have never felt so passionate about something in my WHOLE life. I rushed to the nearest store which sold this super great product. As i walked into the store.. I started thinking..""What if i bought more then just one gallon?"". We all know what happened next.. I openeded my wallet and rushed my fingers to the nearest dead president who had the number 10!!!! yes, i swear. I am just so wacky sometimes. Tehe!!.I bought the milk. gave it away to some bum. I'm sorry guys! The milk just wasn't what i was expecting. My hope and dreams were crushed."
3,WTF!!!,"this product sucks. it spills to easily, becomes a semisolid after only a few hours in the sun, and does anyyone know where this stuff comes from?!? it comes from an utter gentlemen, an utter! in my opinion i would sugest that anyone even thinking about ingesting this product please refrain from doing so."
2,Nasty Customer Service,"This milk worked well when I first got it, but within a few days it wouldn't hold a charge. I called their customer service department and, I don't know if it's in Bangalor or Ireland, but I couldn't understand a word that they said and they began to scream at me.Finally, though, they sent me another one - but that wouldn't hold a charge, either. I'm beginning to wonder if this is truly meant to be a portable product. I still haven't been able to retreive my email and the video is murky.It's a bit heavy, too, to wear on your belt. The good news is that it keeps your hip cool during this sultry summer weather - for a while."
2,Some assembly required... indeed.,"Shipping was fine, and the product was not damaged in any way, but my husband and I (both of us have college degrees, mind you, his in Engineering) could not figure out how to assemble this. No instructions, no diagrams, not even a lousy cheap allen wrench. So basically, weeks after purchase, we're using it as a one gallon paper weight. I haven't gotten any response from Tuscan. It earns two stars simply because it is heavy and does do a fair job of holding down the stack of newspapers awaiting recycling."
2,Tuscan Milk? Not as good,"Nothing is as good as fresh thick Badger milk. Badger milk helps build muscle and strong bones. Badgers can lift 20 times thier own weight and are one of the fierces animals on earth. If you want to be a lean mean fighting maching then get badger milk.Besides, the Badger milk girls have huges pecs and that is always good advertising."
1,This milk made me sad,"The moment I got my hands on this wonderful interweb milk. I began feeling quite depressed. My hair then grew over my right eye and changed to the color black. Suddenly I was wearing eye liner and my legs were absent of hair. I began feeling sad for no reason at all. I tried to cut myself with this milk, but no prevail. How could this happen to me? I suppose I made my mistakes. But now I have no where to run! But I suppose, life goes on. I just hope I don't fade away. Tuscan whole milk makes people very emotional. :'(i'm sooo sorry <3"
3,Very Pricey,"I purchased Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz for $10,000 thinking I would get a superior product. It arrived without spoiling but the date stamp said it would expire in one day. I was unable to use all of the milk. It did not taste any different than any other milk I every purchased. Not worth the extra money."
1,I am tired of this milk!,"I was looking for a nice birthday gift for my 18 year old son and thought that a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk would be perfect. I had this flown in by plane, little did I know that the milk would escape! It was terrible! There was milk on a plane! Luckily my friend Sam Jackson was on board and saved the day, but not before the milk could claim 8 victims. Long story short I am now convicted of conspiracy to unleash milk on a plane and now my son hates me. Thank you Tuscan Whole Milk!"
4,oversite,In examining the packaging of this Tuscan Whole Milk I have found a great oversite. There no instructions for the preparation or use of this product. Surely Tuscan doesn't expect everyone to just guess as that might cause great harm to it's customers and resulting lawsuits.
1,Milk scares me now!,"One day, I was sitting in the kitchen, wondering what I should eat. Then I heard a voice coming out of my 'frig saying ""You want to eat me! I make all your dreams come true!"". Curious, I walked over and Stan pops out trying to sell things like Allen wrenches, copperwire , and toilet seats! I was so scared I slammed the frig shut and yelled ""Salesman!"". I then took the frig and threw it off the nearest bridge. If you like to get attacked by salesmen name Stan, go ahead and buy it. But everyone else, steer clear of it!"
2,For shame!,"With this milk, it is clear that the trend of ""Xtreme"" beverage packaging has finally gone too far. One can be forgiven for idly standing by while various ""energy drinks"" and ""soda pops"" contort and metamorphize into jagged horrors reminiscent of otherworldly landscapes, but one cannot continue to ignore this scourge when it attacks something as beloved and all-American as milk.I don't care how ""cool"" your marketing execs tell you it is, Tuscan. Your milk may taste delicious, but you will never catch me drinking it from this womb-like amoeboid vessel."
3,Complete,"There are a lot of things to be said about whole milk, and incompleteness isn't one of them. I found nothing missing in this milk. But it still begs the question, Why Milk! I looked at my milk and wondered what this completed, what this made ""whole"". I couldn't find any radical change in my life that this milk filled; instead, I was out $3.99 + S&H. No, I turned my back on this milk and went back to my old, incomplete ways. I might try 2%; I might even try skim, although it tastes like water that's had whilte latex paine dropped in it (really, go ahead and try it). So I could only give this milk a 3 out of 5, ironicly, whole milk gets an incomplete score."
4,Better than CRASH.,"All joking aside, watching this gallon of milk turn sour on a countertop would be more enjoyable than watching that CRASH movie. The performances were fine, Matt Dillon's in particular, but the film ultimately substitutes a ridiculous series of coincidences for a storyline. Didn't we see that (to better effect) in MAGNOLIA? The time and talent that was showcased in CRASH would have been better spent producing a television spot for Tuscan Whole Milk. New slogan: ""Tuscan Whole Milk. Better than CRASH."""
2,WARNING: TUSCAN WHOLE MILK NEITHER WHOLE NOR TUSCAN.,"I'm a born and raised Tuskan, Italian people don't make milk, this is simply bad. Plus when I bought the milk out of sheer curiosity, I came to find out that it was half full, THAT'S 64 fl oz, My sega CD has more graphics than that, laugh out loud, it's science. and if you think I'm not a educated man, I'm a botanist, I'll show you my A.A. degree, IN BOTANY!!"
5,Protector of Mankind,"Utterly moov-ing minute globules of fat suspended in a solution of casein, albumin, milk sugar, and inorganic salts.Attributed to milk: ""iron deficiency anemia, allergies, diarrhea, heart disease, colic, cramps, gastrointestinal bleeding, sinusitis, skin rashes, acne, arthritis, diabetes, ear infections, osteoporosis, asthma, autoimmune diseases and possibly even lung cancer, multiple sclerosis and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."" But this stuff is pretty good."
1,Does not help web servers run faster,"I was promised this Tuscan Whole Milk could increase CPU rates in web servers by a factor of a gazillion, as well as increase RAM refresh rates, extend RAID arrays, improve ethernet performance, make ASP pages secure, fix PHP exploits, prevent port probing and block script kiddies and DDoS attacks, as well as ensure no hardware failures would ever happen.After carefully drip-acclimating an entire farm of web servers over a 6 hour period with 18 gallons of milk (6 for each rack), I'm sad to report it doesn't stand up to any of those promises, and now I'm out of a job and a half million customers are gathering a lynch mob."
2,It's A traP!!!1,"This milk is a trap. I was expecting just regular milk but when I got it I read the lable: ""Straight from Xenu himself..""."
1,Needs faster shipping,"I ordered the milk and it arrived just in time for movie my movie night. I rented Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy from the local video store, had a half dozen chocolate chip cookies hot out of the oven, poured a glass of milk and got ready. Just as Control asked Prideaux if he had been followed, I took a bite of the cookie, washed it down with milk.... and blech! Flippin' sour. I don't see what the big deal is if they can't ship the product fast enough to keep it fresh. The movie is great, though."
4,Stick With the Container,"I highly recommend milk that is pasteurized, homogenized, and bottled such as Tuscan. I used to think that I was smart by receiving my milk straight from my neighbor's cow until the day that he informed me that he has no cow but that he has a bull."
4,Four Pours...,"Four pours and seven glasses ago our fathers brought forth on this pallete, a new flavor, conceived in diliciousness, and dedicated to the freshness that all glasses are poured equal."
3,a tale of two...udders,"It was the best of milk, it was the worst of milk, it was the age of homogenization, it was the age of tuscanization, it was the epoch of skim, it was the epoch of calcium, it was the season of mammalian mammary liquid, it was the season of specialized sweat glands, it was the spring of pasteurization, it was the winter of lactose intolerance, we had 1 gallon before us, we had 128 fl.oz. before us, we were all going direct to Tuscany, we were all going direct the other way -in short, the milk was so far like every other milk, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only."
3,Precious K,"I was trying the ""Special K"" diet to lose a dress size in ten days but used the local grocery chain version of the cereal ""Precious K"". When buying it by the pallet, I saved nearly three dollars and twenty nine cents. Where I live, that is darn near the price for one gallon of middle gasoline. When i realized i could use the gift card my sister got me back in December for Amazon.com to buy my favorite milk from the east side....Easst Si-ide! I was elated. I was ready to eat nothing but Precious K and Tuscan Whole. To make a long story short, last week i had a quadruple bipass and they said the inside of my arteries looked like a mixture of blood and cottage cheese. Im not sure if it was the cereal or the milk that caused these adverse reactions, but I will get to the bottom of this. Right now I cant get out of bed, but I am sure that a month or so on Atkins will get me moving again."
3,Don't ship well,"Shipping this milk 500 miles away turned out to be a bad idea, despite the cost savings.The packing was well done, but suprisingly UPS does not have freezer trucks. Next time, I'll ship Next Day Air versus ""Super Saver Shipping"""
2,WARNING!!!,This product seems to have severe compatibility issues with laughing as on two different occasions it has come out of my nose instead of going down my throat during laughter! Be smarter than me and wait for the first service pack before buying!
5,Holy Cow!,"This is the whitest drink ever! If you've never tried milk before, then you should try it, its awesome! It can give you an instant moustache too! You just pour it in a glass and drink it! If you like a browner drink, you can add bosco! If you spill it on the floor, your cats will immediately walk through it! I never put so many exclamation marks in a review, so you know its good! I will buy milk again!"
3,not that great,"I give it only 3 stars because it only comes in one color. White just dosen't work for everybody. Even underwear comes in a choice of colors. Sheesh, you'd think the vendor would've figured that out."
1,milk = cow slavery,"across our planet 1000s more innocent cows are enslaved every day. untold millions of baby cows go to bed thirsty as gallons of cow milk are stolen from their mothers. When you order cow milk on the internet, you are supporting the bovine slavery cartels and making the baby cows cry.Wake up cow milk drinkers...there are other options! www.drinkhumoo.com"
5,great addition,"Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. is a great addition for any collector. and for only 45 dollars,this is a really good price for a jug of milk."
5,Its great for baths too!,"I'm a rich man, insanly rich. So rich that I buy only the finest intrenets milk and use it to fill my bath. Quite frankly this is the finest internets milk availible. I think it may cure cancer, but I'm not a doctor, I'm a (noun). YA RLY!"
5,Tastes Better Purchased Online! Relieves ppl of most common ERRAND,I love that amazon now has relieved me of getting off my ass for the one errand i HAD. Now i just sit on my ass and order it online. And Guess What ---- it tastes better purchased online!!! It may be the fact that Amazon treats it's cows so well.
5,Choose Milk,"People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget is the pleasure of Tuscan Whole Milk. Otherwise we [...] stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on milk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other [...]. Got no money: can't get pissed. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful milk habit."
1,"In the year 2021, Milk was beginning....","-What happen?!-Somebody set up us lactose intolerance!-We Get signal! Main screen turn on.-Hello, gentlemen.-*gasp* It you!-All your milk are belong to us...-What you say!?-You have no chance to survive without calcium make your time...Ha-ha-ha-ha.-Take off all COW fighter... you know what you doing...-Take off all COW, FOR GREAT JUSTICE!"
4,"Good looks, limited uses","While the crisp white color of the milk is a bonus, I have to give this milk only 4 stars because it's so limited in its uses. Besides drinking it, I can't find any other application that doesn't leave a sticky, flaky mess when it dries out.Will try dusting with it tomorrow."
5,Tuscan milk tastes like bacon,"Mmmm.. Bacon. Nothing is better than bacon flavored milk. The delivery was pretty good too, I was able to rub one out in front of the UPS girl that delivered it while I poured it's bacon goodness down the front of me. Thanks Tuscan Milk, you've saved my sex life."
3,overrated,I found some cheaper at the mini mart so we got the neighbors together for a taste test. They were lactose intolerant. So I drank it all. It tastes just like milk.
1,Worth the Price But...,"White as accurately pictured, and probably worth the price but is an inferior product to Provence Whole Milk, 128 fl oz. Also, customer be forewarned! This is not available in Kindle!"
3,What do you mean there are only 8 planets?,We always learned in school that there are 9 planets but now they say Pluto isn't a planet. I heard that the goober that says Pluto isn't a planet was drinking Tuscan Whole Milk when he said it. I think he just wants to be famous or something. I don't care what he says Pluto is my favorite planet and cartoon dog.
2,Not as good as real Milk,"I dunno about all those people writing comments like ""oh this milk is the greatest"" they don't know real Milk. Tuscan Whole Milk is totally just posuers riding on the milk bandwagon. Maybe people should try some *real* milk like Jersey County Cows or Ur Valley, they're the ones that started milk."
3,I had a dream....,"Last night, I dreamt of Tuscan Whole Milk. The gallon of milk was about to speak to me, to tell me the answers to life's greatest question. But then I woke up, and now I'll never know the answer.Heck, I can't even remember the question."
1,My SQUID!,"One day when I was still just a wee lad my squid and I played checkers until we heard a knock at the door. The friendly neighborhood milkman!""Hello,"" I said.I was then got a double dragon fist punch to the stomach. He then continued to shoot lasers out of his eyes burning down my house and killing my squid.The pain...."
2,Good for E.D. too,"As it states in the fine print on the label, ""Call your doctor if you have an erection lasting more than 4 hours after drinking Tuscan whole milk."" They should really make this warning more obvious. Six hours into my boner I passed out and awoke covered in Tuscan whole milk."
3,Good source of calcium?,"I bought this product after reading on this page that it was a ""good source of calcium"". Unfortunately, I was unable to extract any calcium from this product after repeated tries. It seems like all the container had in it was milk. There were no included directions for extracting the alleged calcium. On the bright side, the milk tasted good."
2,Tuscan Whole Milk got me in trouble!,"One night last week, I was hanging out in my favorite bar in Malibu. As the evening wore on, I switched from my usual gin-and-tonics to White Russians. Since I am used to only the best, I asked the bartender to make each of them with genuine Tuscan Whole Milk. He obliged.Nine Tuscan-Whole-Milk-laden White Russians later, I found myself babbling anti-Semitic comments to a cop by the road. Now I'm at the center of a media firestorm!In conclusion, this milk is tasty, but be careful!-Mel G."
3,"Whatever to you, Tuscan Milk","Tuscan Milk, you think you are like the best. You are so conceited. True story: Tuscan Milk came up to me and was like, ""Hey Baby, I'm Tuscan Milk. ""And I'm like ""Yeah. Whatever."""
3,My first time with Tuscan milk...,"I'm not sure how normal this is, so I thought I'd post a review. I recently ordered Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, and recieved it only three days after I ordered it, which is lovely, thank you Amazon.However, after drinking about half the bottle I noticed a couple things that I'm not sure are normal. First of all it made me a little gassy. Some Tums cleared that up, but I wasn't sure what to do about the hair loss, the rash on my thighs and arms, or the slight fever. Recently, it's been stealing my silverware, and I'm pretty sure it is responsible for the small kitchen fire that singed my drapes and my cat pretty badly. Also, and I'm not totally sure this is related, but about a week after I drank the product, every grade I ever recieved was retroactively changed to a C-.I've only bought milk at my grocery store before this. Is this normal for Tuscan milk?"
2,"Overrated ""masterpiece""","Serves me right for ordering art off the internet. I spoke with a customer representative about my Tuscan Whole Milk, and they assured me that the product will soon be available in different sizes and colors. I ordered the item believing I could exchange it if my decor didn't match, and I was dismayed to discover that the attractive Tuscan Whole Milk label only appears on one side. Its bulbous shape makes it unfit for wall hanging, and three sides of uniformly boring color (aside from the accenting red cap) make it impossible to display in the round. Purely a curio cabinet item, at least until alternative versions are designed. While the piece works conceptually, highlighting the dichotomy between consumerism and evanescence, it's practical realization is a disappointment. I'd recommend ordering a print, rather than the sculpture itself."
2,No Truth in Advertising,"Be sure you read the fine print -- the picture is not an accurate representation of this product.Mine arrived in a cow, ""some assembly required."" On the plus side, I have to admit it WAS pretty fresh."
1,RIP Rupert,"I had purchased this Tuscan Whole Milk last week. My pet betta fish, Rupert, had been ailing. I thought maybe he was low on calcium. So, in the hopes of restoring his usual vigor, I replaced his spring water with Tuscan Whole Milk. At first, he seemed okay. Then, he suddenly started emitting a green, cloudy substance. When I tried to take him out and put him in fresh water, it was too late. He had already started forming legs. He then jumped out of the Tuscan Whole Milk and ran out the open door. He was subsequently run over by a car. Without Tuscan Whole Milk, I would still have my fish. DO NOT PUT FISH IN TUSCAN WHOLE MILK"
2,I'll tell you...,"I think the cow got into the onion patch with this one. As far as milk goes, Tuscan is the pits. Tastes scalded, not creamy enough, and they don't promise anything as far as hormones and antibiotics go. Pee-you, that's what I say."
1,"Thought this was like ""Badger Milk""","Very disappointed! After viewing the movie the Animal, which starred by far the greatest thespian of our time (Rob Schneider) I fancied myself a little of the Badger Milk he drank in the movie. I was totally bummed out to find that the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 Fluid Ounces was indeed the nursing milk obtained from the bovine species, not from the badger. I guess Gaylord was right, ""If it has nipples, it can be milked"". I am returning the unused portion back to amazon and expect a full refund."
1,Craddle on Delivery,"Horrible service, I bought my milk and went with the 7-9 day super saver shipping method and it arrived warm and curdled. What the hell?"
3,all your wildest dreams will come true.,I see you're drinking 1%. Is that 'cause you think you're fat? 'Cause you're not. You could be drinking whole if you wanted to.The defect in that one is bleach.Yessssssss.This tastes like the cow got into an onion patch.Yessssssss.
5,Now that is good milk,"Let's face it I never thought of buying Milk from Amazon. Well that was my first mistake. This is the greatest milk ever! Although it was just a bit spoiled with the 3-4 day delivery time and me being out of town at a milking convention it is till better than any milk I ever had. I have had cat milk, goat milk, human milk, and even camel milk but Tuscan Milk must come from heaven's above. I am now buying Tuscan cottage cheese, Tuscan Sour Cream, Tuscan Ice Cream and even Tuscan Half and Half. Curdled I say yes if it is Tuscan!!!!!!"
4,User guide requested... delivered (Beta 4.1),"This guide provides system requirements, installation instructions, and other, step-by-step instructions that you can use to deploy milk clusters if you are using Tuscan Milk Server(tm) 2003 1 Gallon, Enterprise Edition, or Tuscan Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, operating systems.The milk cluster technology in Tuscan Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, and Tuscan Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, helps ensure that you have access to important dairy-based resources. You can use milk cluster technology to create several cluster nodes that appear to users as one gallon milk. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node begins to provide service. This is a process known as ""dairy-failover."" In this way, milk clusters can increase the availability of critical applications and resources in the dairy farm."
3,"Ah, so-so Beverage...What's the Big Deal?","I purchased this Tuscan Milk because I was told - by a reputable source, now unreputable - that this was some Italian beverage. He told me that Italians, in their better moments, drink Tuscan when they wish to be, well, Italian at heart.It was just regular milk. Where can I find my friend Robert and punch his lights out?"
4,Cal,"I picked up a gallon at the local SPCA...it'd been abused. When I put out my hand, it shied away at first. Once I'd gained it's trust, that gallon jug would follow me everywhere around the house.Sad to say, I never noticed a hole it had dug under our front fence, and my little Tuscan ended up splattered on the street. My wife was inconsolable, and my son hung himself.I'm ordering another and putting it on his grave to see if it'll bring him back."
2,did not meet my expectations,"I saw this on sale at my local grocery store. I figured hey its Tuscan.. it must be quality. I was horribly wrong. As soon as i opened it, my daughter started to act a little strange as she quoted passages from the bible that i've never heard before (considering we are not a religious family). I just ignored it and had a bowl of frosted flakes. Two weeks later I find her bed ridden.. i figured she just wanted some 2%. i attempted to pour some on her to snap her out of it. it boiled off her skin. Now she speaks in an old english tongue and i cannot understand her. I am now writing a letter to Tuscan seeking damages in the form of coupons."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this, expecting to enjoy a nice, sweet glass of orange juice. When I opened it, it was milk. I poured it into a box and sent it back."
1,Endlessly Self Absorbed...,"I honestly couldn't finish the gallon, I found it so annoying. Apparently, all Tuscan Whole Milk is interested in is Tuscan Whole Milk. I'll grant you that it's fairly accomplished as a liquid and there were points where I was mildly refreshed, but forgive me if I don't find milk-milk-milk as endlessly fascinating as Tuscan Whole Milk does.The whole thing could have benefited from some Dr. Pepper or Mountain Dew...though of course, one can hardly expect a self-abosrbed whiner like Tuscan Whole Milk to agree."
3,Ive had better,Stick with your local grocer. Pouring this stuff down your pants isn't any different than what you can get in town. I do like the color scheme on the packaging however.
1,Go with synthetic.,I only got about about 3000 miles before engine locked up. Funny exhaust smell. Poot noise at stop lights.. Poor customer support.
2,I felt manipulated,"The product description contains the intentional omission that would, if included, dissuade the heedful challenged buyer. IT ONLY COMES IN A RIGHT HANDED JUG! Nuff said."
1,The Milk of Despair,"Originally I thought this wonderful product from Tuscan would be the magic ingredient in my potion to seduce a beautiful young woman whom I adored. By mixing this into my prize pancakes, it seemed I would be assured of success. Instead, I have been undone, and milk of misery has become the bane of my existence.The hideous truth is that this milk contains a secret mind controlling substance that transforms those with free will into cult like worshipers of the great and all powerful Moo. Instead of becoming my lover, she gave her all to the love that dare not udder its name. Bovangelism, Mooddhism, Bessie-ontology, Moothuran, Elsielam, or Moodaism; it matters not by what name this dark religion passes, only that it is the cause of all ruin. My heart is in pieces, and the woman to whom I would have given these pieces is now oblivious to me. Instead, like a Stepford Wife hopped up on vitamin D enriched valium, she romps blissfully in fields of clover, nuzzling Holsteins."
5,Fantastic!,"This product is fantastic!! I sat down one night to read a book before bed with a glass of Tuscan Whole Milk. I grew tired, brushed my teeth, and then went to bed. When I woke in the morning, I was surprised to find that my shaved head had regrown all of its hair!!!!"
1,I've had better whole milk.,"LIARS! It doesn't ship from NY. The shipping time was 4-6 weeks, because it was being shipped from Tuscany. I had this on my wedding registry (see button below item) and didn't receive it until AFTER we had returned from our honeymoon..... IN TUSCANY. Thanks Amazon. Thanks alot. Next time I get married I'm going to register for Newark Orange Juice.... or Long Island Ice Tea."
1,Forget cow milk. Try llama milk!,"First the cows try to get you to eat chicken instead of beef. Now they conspire to sell more of their milk and milk products by encouraging innocent citizens to not only buy milk, but do it the easy way and order it online. What next? Cows running for office? Taking over the world? Moo-topia? Come on folks, where does it end? I say we take a stand. Don't be fooled by this cow-spiracy. Don't give into their udder propaganda. Stand tall. Demand llama milk. Not only is it tasty, but llama milk is lower in fat and salt and higher in phosphorous and calcium than cow or goat milk. Sure, you don't get as much, but think what your preventing - a cow takeover. (Plus, there's the added benefit of saving millions of innocent chickens too.)Just say no to the cows."
5,breast-feeding for dummies.,"July 20th was the first night i have eaten a steak in 22 years. As a smoker for 35, i successfully rotted out and lost all of my teeth. The morning of the 20th i sat down for my usual morning ritual of homemade grapefruit and asparagus yogurt. I pulled out 3 freshly bought gallons of Tuscan Whole milk and measured out the typical 45 cups. After my 10 minutes of preparation i was finished making my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next two weeks. The taste.. Well, the taste was amazing and shortly there after it was like an earthquake in my mouth. Thirteen and a half minutes later i had fully reproduced all of my rotted out teeth. My husband Willard was astonished and loves the new sensations. Ciao."
2,Okay decor piece,"First, this product only comes in a bland white. I would think they could do better than just white. I think it would look nice in a blue, or red or green. But no. But this decor piece is nice for a modern look.So I decided to put it on a coffee table, but after about a week it began to really stink, and i got really angry, but then I realized that perhaps it was an outdoor piece. So I set it outside next to some chairs, and it had a nice effect. I called some friends over so we could talk outside(But really so I could show off this product. I got some compliments, but woman commented that the piece was far too gaudy and risky for someone like me. but I kept it anyway. This decoration is okay overall, but the designers need some more creativity."
1,Tuscan milk not good for keyboards,"This is just a head's up regarding various inaccurate reports on the internet about Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz:Dismiss any reports that claim this product is excellent for cleaning keyboards. Twenty-five gallons later, I have nothing but sticky keys.Don't buy into the myth!"
5,MAGIC,This is pure magic. Make no mistake. Your life will change. You will suddenly see children laughing and playing around you. Members of the opposite sex will throw themselves at you. You will realize a reality more real than reality itself. All for what?? Nothing. Abso-freakin-lutely nothing.But it's still cool.
1,This milk was used!,"This milk was supposed to be new but arrived used, possibly with backwash. Eewwww! I will not be ordering again!"
4,"Ah, sweet nectar","So white, so clean, so cold and smooth. O, milk of cow; soothe me, nourish me, protect me. Thy coolness and thy virtues are vast and marvelous.Mmmmmm. Yummy."
3,Buyer Beware: Gas Guzzler,"The plastic container makes the Tuscan Milk a Whole lot worse (pun intended) than the plain milk carton we all used to drive in. When the plastic hits the tarmac, the friction created makes it slow and inefficient, and in effect an impracical vehicle for commuting. Stick with cartoned milk."
4,Best Kept Secret,"I purchased 10 of these. I have recently discovered an improvement that not many of you may know. Please keep this a secret. I have found that if you take a dark, creamy, viscous additive made from the South American cocoa bean (commonly known as ""chocolate""), it will greatly improve the taste. Beware, it WILL change the color of the product but this is TOTALLY normal. You will need a stirring implement to avoid the settling of sediment. Caution: the ingestion of the altered product by offspring will increase activity level. Overall, I highly recommend this product. Cats like it too.P.S. There is also a rumor that this will work with strawberries but I dare not try it.Milton S. Hershey IV"
3,Milks,"Boy do I like my milks... Especially when it comes to me in the mail. I was chillin on my couch, sippin down some warm water because i don't have a refrigirator, when my friendly neighboorhood mail man delivered me a fresh, cold, sweat dripping, $3.99 gallon of milk which a promptly chugged and washed down with a full box of Lucky Charms."
4,Milk May Spill With Various Outcomes,"If you pour a glass of milk and it is half empty and it spills you will cry. However, if you pour a glass of milk and the glass is half full and it spills you will be fine. If the glass is less than half empty and it spills you will cry and scream like a baby and may need to seek psychiatric treatment. If the glass is nearly full and it spills, you will be fine and your happy disposition will be enhanced by the fact that you are able to clean up the milk. If you are in Chicago and a cow kicks over the glass of milk it may just extinguish an open flame and a disaster will be averted. If the glass of milk spills into a bowl of cherries, you may have a mixed metaphor or the start of a lovely dessert."
3,you'll laugh you'll cry,"I am a big man. I drive a bus for a living. But the first time I drank this milk, I wept like a baby.If you drink this milk with sincerity, you will discover that deep down, inside, you are seething with intense feelings. Joy and sorrow, loneliness and bliss, intermingled together. I cannot begin to describe the emotional exhileration.Don't fret about the price, or lactose intolerance. You need this milk, and this milk needs you"
5,Fresh Sqeezed Milk!,"So I was making my nightly rounds to collect my momey, when one of my female ""employees"" hands me this jug of white stuff. Just as I raised my hand, she screams, NO WAIT IT'S REALLY MILK! I thought the container was some freshly squozen MAN necture and i was 'bout to lay down the law and show these ""ladies"" who the boss eeis. From out of no where, my cousin RayRay AKA Spiderfingaz comes up with a few cups and a bag of cookies. After that, much happiness was had by all. That Tuscan Milk is the MFn SHART! Buy it now before it's all gone.Others who have bought this product have also purchased...Captain Crunch CerealRubber nipplesLima BeansKeroseneGerbilsRubber HosePretty Woman (VHS)"
3,"Tuscan Whole Milk, 1Gallon, 128 fl oz","It is by Milk alone I set my breakfast in motion. It is by the juice of the Cow that digestion acquire speed, the lips acquire a milk mustache, the mustache become a warning. It is by milk alone I set my breakfast in motion."
4,"On Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, haiku in five stanza","Tuscan Whole Milk, 1Gallon, 128 floz. In fall, drink.Drink people, slowly.Like snails fluid, but ounces, isas Tuscan Whole Milk.Ounces are fluid,Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon.Not solid. Not gas.Tuscan Whole Milk. Injust one gallon so much joy.Autumn, yesteryear.Tuscan Whole Milk, 1Gallon, 128 floz. Best in fall"
5,Amazing!,"This milk was given to me in a dream by a wizard dressed in shimmering blue satin. Upon waking from this glorious dream, I found myself clutching this precious gallon of milk. Could this dairy product truly be a gift from the gods above? I would say yes. Now, in my career fighting crime, this milk grants me superpowers far beyond those of any mortal man. I am the guardian of our beloved planet, and it is all thanks to the lactalicious goodness of Tuscan Whole Milk. Bless you, Tuscan Whole Milk, Earth thanks you."
2,A wicked Mistress,"Yet, taught by time, my heart has learned to glow for Tuscan Milk's good, and melt at Store brand milk's woe.Hateful to me as the gates of Hades is this milk who hides one thing in it's jug and pours another.Be still my heart; thou hast known worse than this."
4,"It's Milk, OK, We're talking about Milk....",It's MILK people. Why are we reviewing MILK ???????????????????
1,What!?,"Who buy's milk on the internet? For some strange reason, I can't see supermarkets going out of business anytime soon."
1,Milk was spoiled!,"I drank my entire jug as soon as it arrived, so there was no way it had time to spoil. Guess what? The milk was so spoiled that I was vomiting within five minutes of my last sip. Those a-holes at Tuscan owe me a new carpet."
5,This milk saved my life!,"Well where do I start? I was at about the end of my journey on this beautiful earth,when at last I saw a sign from the heavens...God came down from his thrown and showed me the way! This gallon of milk brought down from god almighty himself, he said to me ""Drink this my Child"", so I followed him in the drinking of this potion they called Tuscon milk. I felt like I had defeated satan after devouring the luscious ,smooth ,creamy potion! And that is how Tuscon Milk cured my cancer!!!"
3,An ordinary liquid,"Not nearly as good as the magical milk from the goats tended by The Sidhe of Lisdoonvarna, but that elixir is difficult to come by in New York. Still, as milk goes, wouldn't you enjoy immersing yourself in a tub of this ordinary liquid?"
4,Lovely for making custard substitutes for Ambien,"I'm always illegally importing dairy products into the US to give my food the 40%+ fat necessary to create a truly European experience. Using this Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon 128 fl oz, however, is just over the top! It's so creamy rich my customers can no longer eat more than one bite of my Panna Cotta without becoming drowsy and on the verge of a sugar coma. Usually we like customers who eat themselves into a caloric stupor, as they tend to use their cell phones less often in the dining room and tend to over-tip. But, when a Friday night run of Panna Cotta orders for dessert means 80% of our tables have people sleeping at them, the dining room loses a certain flair. So, I'm going for the four stars, but recommending Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon 128 fl oz for home use only. Consider it a replacement for the main ingredient in your 1970s LSD parties, and follow all the same rules."
1,Tuscan milk beware,As an historian of Milk it has come to my attention that some of the reviews on here may have been written by Mr Tuscan Milk or Mrs Milk. I am pleased and mightily relieved that this contaminant slime has been exposed to the light and begun to be scrubbed clean.
1,My Mistake,"I was very disappointed when this item arrived, but it was my own fault. You see, I thought that I was ordering the Tuscan MILF! The box showed up on my doorstep, and I was immediately confused, because there were no air holes. Still optimistic, I assumed that there must be some sort of alternate breathing device, but alas, I was wrong. It was merely 1 gallon, 128 fl oz of refreshing beverage.I should have paid more attention to the included pictures. Heed my warning!!..if you are in the market for a comely foreign matriarch, DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!Tasty addition to my Froot Loops though."
2,Questionable advertising practices,"Warning!I purchased this product on the assumption that it came from a cow -- a reasonable assumption, in this country.I'm 99% sure however that the ""milk"" I received actually came out of a camel. Thicker, saltier, more of that umami protein taste.That would be fine for making my own camel cheese or unt-ka duhd, but is not what I wanted in my latte (additionally, the higher fat content clogged the jets of my Braun)!"
4,Canadian milk,"I like milk in general, but I wish they had some Canadian milk here. As Canadian milk comes in bags."
3,It tastes like $45.00 milk,"This is some mind-blowing milk. Seriously, I'd like to meet the cow that can deliver such premium quality white stuff a gallon at a time."
2,Note: Not iPod compatible,"Despite its pleasing white color, it seems Tuscan Whole Milk is not compatible with iPod products. Attempts to adapt iPod connectors to the Tuscan Whole Milk product resulted in failure, and required extensive clean-up. Why does the packaging not reveal this limitation, and when can we expect iPod-compatability from Tuscan Whole Milk?"
3,"Tasty, but poor connectivity","I bought this milk last month to use in my work. I'm on the IEEE Power Over Milk (POM)Committee, and I naturally assumed that this milk would be suitable for our tests. I found that it satisfied only four of the six performace attributes we are trying to achieve:1 - Can you insert a std RJ45 connector into it: Yes2 - will it conduct 1-48volts without overheating: Yes3 - Will it transmit data at the rate of 1gigabit per secon: No4 - Does it fully saturate and ANSI Std. Corn-Flake: Yes5 - Does it have a current capacity ov at least 830 milliamps: No6 - Does it readily dissolve chocolate syrup to a point of creamery goodness: YesI cannot in good conscience reccomend this milk for Power Over Milk applications, but then again, that technology is years from being ready anyway."
3,Not a great deal...,"First of all, I must say 'Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz' is a great product, and other reviews will verify that. However, I was able to buy the same product, slightly used, on Craigslist for only $84.99. I haven't received it yet, but I warn anybody buying 'Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz' on Amazon is probably getting ripped off."
1,Beware of voiding your warranty!,"An issue that prospective purchasers need to be aware of.In order to preserve Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz's power, I was informed that I needed to root it, then upgrade it from FroYo to Ice Cream Sandwich. Well, let me tell you that I completely bricked my Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, and upon trying to return it for a replacement, I was informed that I voided the warranty by rooting it.This should be spelled out more clearly in the terms and conditions."
4,The secret to Tuscan milk.,"Like many, I have been enjoying Tuscan milk for years. It is delicious and quite nourishing. Now that many foodstuffs are no longer available or are being severely rationed, it is good to know that you can still get all the Tuscan milk you could want. But one day recently a very old man approached me and said that he knew something terrible. He looked around to make sure no one was listening. ""Tuscan Milk is people"" he cried."
1,Portal Storm Madness,"Why would you like this milk? I was an intern to Dr. Brandon Callahan, PhD. in a US research facility. During an experiment one day, some doofus with the initials of G.F. left some milk from the break room in right next to the sample for use in the experiment later. Next thing you know, the whole teleport chamber explodes (Dr. Callahan perished in the blast). Fast forward 9 years, and I've got overwatch breathing down my neck every minute of the day. Plus the citadel ruins the sunset at the beach. Thanks a lot Tuscan Whole Milk. Thanks a lot."
5,Freakin' Great!,"It has been said many a time by Mr.T, and that was, ""stay in School, don't do drugs, and drink your milk!"" Now, i can't say i agree with the first two statements, drinking milk is a definite must! I was a little skeptical about ordering milk over the internets, but through a system of tubes (and thankfully, not a big truck) i recieved my milk lol, fast. Now, you may say, O RLY? And i would have to say YA RLY!"
1,"had heard great things, but milk did not live up to hype","Several friends of my friends from California had raved about Milk for years. Now that Milk is finally available in nyc i was so excited i waited on line at Gristedes for 2 hours prior to opening.Much to my dissapointment when I finally drank Milk it turned out to be bland and mediocre. Has anyone noticed it tastes like potato leek soup that's been watered down?If you've been looking for something to quench your thirst LOOK ELSEWHERE! Milk is just a hipster fad, and youd be wise to stay off the bandwagon."
2,I've had better,For starters I prefer milk in glass containers. I feel the thin plastic throw away container just screams cheapo - especially when entertaining dinner guests.The quality is so-so - it could be whiter and I feel that it doesn't quench thirst as well as say heavy cream.
3,Tuscan Milk ruined my life,"I started doing milk 3 years ago, i was still a junior in NYU then. I used just a little at first... just to help cram for exams, but when that lonely summer came around, i used it just to function. I'm 24 now, i live on the streets, i only own one set of clothes, i beg for enough money to get my next fix of that delicious creamy white milk. I've been on tuscan milk for a long time, sometimes i wish i had never been born.Thank you tuscan milk..."
3,Milk @$45,"Maybe I'm a bit old fashioned, but I don't understand why it's necessary to buy milk by mail. Do all these people live too far from a store that carries milk? That can't be. There must be something I'm missing here.Now $45 may seem like a lot of money for a gallon of milk. Wait a minute it is a lot of money. Again, I don't get it.Can somebody please explain what the deal is? I eagerly await a response.Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz"
1,Unsafe at any Speed,"Much like the Chevy Corvair, use of this product is unsafe at any speed. Buyer beware."
3,Time Travel,"Did the time traveler who picked this milk up from the year 2300 happen to notice what inflation had driven the price of gasoline up to? Also, what will the FaceBook stock be worth?"
2,I've had better milk,"I think that this milk is dog's milk. I cannot be sure. I can't remember what dog's milk tastes like, and my twin brother Romulus is traveling abroad and I can't ask him to taste it.I had it faxed to my home, which alters the taste slightly. You pay for convenience, I guess.The milk poured out of the bottle in one long strand, which made me doubt its freshness. More like a snake, or a long, long grub of some kind."
5,Must be taken ORALLY!,"Brothers and sisters, be with me now as I remember the transcendent crack felt inside my throat as each cilia moved from static positions in a parched desert. The serenity of that moment was surpassed only by the feeling of fullness within my loins: filling in the void left by my father when he left twenty years prior.But this is a cautionary tale.One night I was oiling my girl an boyfriends by the fire place whilst drinking three ounces ofTuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl ozwhen Jaime suggested that injecting Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, would cure him of a missing left toe. He shot a drop of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and immediately exploded.Understand that Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is only to be drunk, never to be injected directly into the blood stream.-01011101"
2,Baby Talk,We fed this to our grandchild and afterwards she started speaking perfect Italian! We are not Italian. How can we get her back to just baby talk before her mother is off work and picks her up?
2,False Claims,"Hey der. I had dis big ole wart on my right toe and dat dagum thing hurt like da dickens. My buddy says to me, ""Try dis here Tuscan Whole Milk. At'll fix it.""Well I dun drank the whole galln. And you know what? That wart is still there and now it smells funny. Stuff sure did taste good though."
3,My friends stole it,"My friends ninjad this milk from my mailbox (i dunno how it got there) they drank it all and went craZy running around.i tried to stop them. i told them NEDM makes this cool, all they could say was Needs More Doom Music. i am sad now."
1,NINJAS,so like i just bought some of this milk andi sit down to have a glass when out of no where i get attacked by a ninja he took my wife and 2 kids grabed my milk and flew away this milk ruined my life and seems to draw ninjas as well
2,Um!,"Did this milk make anyone else GLOW IN THE DARK? After i had some with my midnight snack, i went to crawl into bed next to my husband and i realized my skin was GLOWING. I was glowing so bright that i woke him up. I told him it had to be the milk, he drank some and now HE glows too! we had to go and buy those face masks so that we can sleep next to each other without the birghtness of our skin waking each other up. Its raelly a pain in the tuckus."
1,I am lost... What is this?!?!?,"I am totally lost:Since I live in Europe (but not in the UK) I do not have the slightest idea why you sell ""milk"" extracted form a russian-owned-british-made-car (the TVR Tuscan) - Is it some kind of white lubricating oil? white hydraulic fluid?In Europe we can buy cow milk, goat milk, sheep milk... but I find the concept of car ""milk"" really disgusting.The whole thing about selling liquids in gallons... What the hell is a gallon?"
2,A Tragedy,"This is the story of how I stopped drinking milk. I was out on a stroll to the grocery store, just minding my own business. Suddenly, I heard a rustling in the trees. Before I could realize what was happening, a jug of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz flew out of nowhere and lodged itself in my knee. In conclusion, I used to be a milk drinker, until I took a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk to the knee."
2,Grade A? I don't think so!,"The claims that this milk is ""grade A"" are completely fabricated. I drank this milk before all my exams this semester and didn't get a single A.My roommate told me I should have studied but I thought I was made in the shade depending on the good folks at Tuscan to come through for me.It did come with an ""Easy"" button though, so I haven't run out of typewriter ribbon since I bought it."
2,Hmmm,"Not the crunchy flavor I am used to. Still gives me strong bones though.People, before you complain, always check the date branded on the side. Anything prior to 2004 is probably not good anymore."
3,A Milk of Great Character But Dubious Background,"I purchased a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk to serve at a casual evening party for a group of close friends. You know the sort of thing - sitting on the the floor on large Moroccan cushions, feeding each other figs, seeing who could get the best milk moustache, and so on.Tuscan Whole Milk was certainly equal to the occasion in the areas of body and aroma, but we found its Tuscanity to be questionable. We suspect it might have been Sicilian or Abruzzese, or possibly even Neapolitan. It was also given to telling spurious stories and we don't believe for a minute that it was originally up for the part of Junior Soprano."
2,No Flash Support; Very Disenchanting,"I was actually able to get my hands on a Tuscan Whole Milk (the 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz version) and despite it's obvious function as a revolutionary product at at an unbelievable price, it is yet another device that does not support Flash.This was personally very disappointing and thus, TWM will not be able to meet my needs as an active student. I had very high hopes for this product, even if I already owned similar ones (water 16 fl oz, tea 1L) and was still figuring how to best incorporate it into my daily routine.Well, hopefully competition will remedy this situation or I might buy one and be tempted to jailbreak it (which might require voiding the warranty as online forums say it requires breaking the plastic liner.)"
5,Tusamble,"We the drinkers of the most delicious and frothy, exclusive tuscan, bovinian fluids, in order to form a more perfect thirst quenching beverage, establish dairy-dominance, insure pasture tranquility, provide for the common cow (colloquially cows), promote the general calcium rich quality, and secure the ensured even and whole percentages of this succulent potable for ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Prime Milking of the Mammary glanduale of the Bos Primigenius."
5,A Cure For What Ails You,"For 16 years I suffered from chronic lactose intolerance. Then something wonderful came along and changed my life: Tuscan Whole Milk. The Tuscan bovine isn't your average barnyard cow. These incredible animals have been genetically engineered to produce a milk fortified with revolutionary microbial properties. Tuscan Whole Milk promotes dramatic enzyme acceleration within the lining of your stomach while at the same time acting as a selective antiseptic that dissolves malicious bacteria and parasites. After a single month of drinking Tuscan Whole Milk I no longer have any trouble digesting dairy products. Now, when my kids ask me, ""Daddy, can we go out for ice cream?"". My answer is, ""Sure we can, thanks to Tuscan Whole Milk."""
3,Regrets,"In hindsight I regret spending $68 on a gallon of milk now that rent is past due, but at the time it seemed reasonable. Good milk, but I don't know if it was $68 good. Fast shipping."
2,"Newer, better models","I am an avid fan of milk, and amazon.com. I have been looking for better milk to replace my current milk that I got with my gateway pc 2 years ago. That milk only had 64fl oz. I was disappointed when I found out that this milk only had 128fl oz. That is soooo 1 year ago. The industry standard for milk is now 512 fl oz or even 1024 fl oz (if you are really wealthy). Before buying, make sure you check out the milk available at other websites! You might be disappointed"
4,Limited Color Selections,"Be advised this product comes in only one color....WHITE.What's the matter Tuscan Whole Milk? Afraid of a little color in your life? It's a different world now with President Obama in the ""Whitehouse"". Even Eggs are available in Brown.Get with the times."
3,How can we know this is cow's milk?,"Nowhere in the description is there a claim that this is actually cow's milk. How can we know for sure? It could come from a dog, a horse, or nearly any other mammal."
4,Could be better,I was a refreshing glass but could have been better if there were a Phoenix version.
1,Planned Obsolescence!,"Initial set up of the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is easy, just unscrew the cap and remove the liner. It has a surprisingly rich set of standalone and integrated food possibilities and the addition of vitamin D was a bonus.However, I find that this product quickly becomes unstable (even without overclocking) to the point that it is no longer usable. At first I tried passive cooling to prevent the degradation, but ultimately had to switch to an active cooling method to prolong the products usefulness.Note that even with this extreme care the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz will still break down. Even if you never use the product it will still fail! This is the worst kind of planned obsolescence, requiring you to replace this product every two weeks whether you use it or not!Pros: Inexpensive, easy set up.Cons: Short product lifecycle. No instruction manual. No optical/coax sound output."
1,I lost my job due to this product,"Let's get this straight from the start. I grew up on a farm, a Mennonite farm. I know cows. I know milk. Be VERY, VERY careful with this product. Some of the cows are injected with exogenous testosterone. Don't ask me how I know.- Floyd Landis"
2,Watch out for counterfeit knockoffs!,"I was delighted to receive a gallon of Tuscan Whole milk as a gift from my girlfriend for Christmas, however upon opening the bottle and pouring a glass I knew something was amiss. It didn't have the same full bodied taste and satin like texture that defines Tuscan whole milk. It tasted somewhat healthy and a little watered down.After doing some research I discovered that a company in Shenzhen has been repackaging Tuscan 2% milk (green cap & label) in gallon milk containers with counterfeit whole milk labels (red label & red cap). From the outside you can tell the counterfeit from the real ones because the counterfeit milk labels are missing the star above the cow. Also the red cap seemed a little pinkish to me."
5,The Wholest,"Guys I am going to go out on a limb here and state that this is without a doubt the wholest milk I have ever purchased. If you, like I, enjoy your milk whole you will follow my advice and purchase this milk pronto. None of that watered down 2%, and God help you if you accidentally find fat free milk in your Cheerios one day. Avoid those wholeless milks whenever possible."
5,Happy Cows come from Tuscan,"Happy cows come from California. But, Tuscan cow can jump over the moon. Got Tuscan Whole Milk 128fl oz and never gone back!"
1,Does not deliver,Thumbs Down. I added to my gas tank. No difference felt. Very disappointed will not buy again.
2,Don't believe the hype!,"I've been hearing a lot about ""milk"" lately. Its supposed to ""do a body good"" and improve your quality of life. My friends have been telling me for years that its essential to a balanced meal. I was just told last week that ""everyone was doing it"" and if I wanted to be cool I should too.Well, after 30 years I've just had my first glass of milk and I've got to say that I'm not impressed. Sure, it goes great with cereal, but I still couldn't run all that fast. I can't lift up cars or move giant pieces of concrete to save small animals. I still can't fly, turn invisible, or change into spandex in a phone booth. The only thing I was really impressed with was the way milk bubbles out my nose when I laugh. Still, thats not enough to get me to drink 3 glasses of the stuff a day! All in all I'm more than a little disappointed. I'd suggest shopping around a bit before spending that $3.99."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this milk recently for my family room, but I was very unhappy when I received it. First of all, it is not the same color as it appears to be online. The picture makes it look white, but it is really more of a gray color- not what I was expecting. Secondly, the construction and materials are very cheap. Plastic, plastic everywhere! You'll be lucky if this thing lasts for a few months before you have to replace it. The handle is a nice idea, but not really that useful since I generally don't take milk with me when I travel. Especially now that I can no longer bring it on an airplane. On top of all this, my milk was shipped to me with a dent in the side. I contacted Tuscan to inquire about sending it in for repairs and was told that it does not even have a warranty! I recommend you keep looking."
5,A Brilliant Nose with Hints of Citrus,"On the nose this milk is exceptionally elegant. Dominant floral notes (mint and white flowers) mingle with hints of fresh fruit (citrus fruits, fresh almonds). As it undergoes aeration, riper notes of vanilla and nougat come to the fore, giving a pleasant roundness to the milk. At this stage a typical whole milk characteristic, crisp elegance, clearly prevails over aromatic strength.In the mouth, the milk, especially in the gallon size, reveals its true personality. Fruity notes (white peaches, grapefruit and bergamot) dominate an energetic attack on the palate, which is prolonged by the structure and roundedness of the milk. The balance, a combination of freshness and vigour, is ideal. With a finish that is extremely persistent and clean, mineral notes add force to this noble cow juice."
3,Tuscan Milk Adds Nothing to Creativity,"I eagerly intercepted the UPS man bringing my Tuscan Whole Milk. Milk from Tuscany! Whole milk of the ilk that nourished the likes of Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci! This whole milk would have to increase my creativity and intelligence, and I might pick up some Italian along the way. But alas, after drinking several 128 fl oz jugs of the ""white vino"" of Tuscany, I'm no more creative and my Italian still sounds like loud, slow English."
2,Proceed with Caution,"I was sorely dissapointed with this product. Let's just say it's no coincidence that ""Tuscan Whole Milk"" is an anagram for ""Will Nuke Stomach"" and ""Chunks, Allow Time.""Next time I feel the urge to quaf a tall glass of bovine mammary gland secretions, I doubt I will turn to the Internet. If anyone knows of any mail order catalogs with a good dairy selection, please let me know!"
1,Fatally flawed,I found the plot was short on coherence and the characters lacked depth. Plus it looked like I peed myself when it spilled onto my lap.I do not recommend this product.
2,not compatible with milk glass night lamp!,"I'm quite disappointed with this product.Although there is a farm nearby, I purchased from Amazon, expecting that it would be compatible with another amazon product I had previously purchased,Milk Glass Cup LED Night Light Lamp.My night light has been dimming recently, and I assumed that I'd be able to simply add more of this product to regain the lost light output.I used almost half of the container, but did not see any increase in light whatsoever.I will continue to try to make this product work; the package seems to light up when I open the refrigerator door, so perhaps I'm doing something wrong- I intend to call Tuscan technical support, and will update this review if they they can get the product to work properly."
1,skip this item,Item falsely advertised. The milk is NOT Tuscan. It is clearly inferior Umbrian whole milk. I want my money back.
1,Not so good!!,"So I ordera thisa milka and it takea abouta week on How you say UPS Ground. I getta milka and it very hotta outside where i live so i figura that the milka should be somewhata cold for me to drink but it was no cold about it. So i drink milk but i live by myself go figure, It take about two week for me to finish but since it was not so cold whena UPS bring it i left it ona backa porch. I get how you say sick as a dog for the wholea two weeks. My friend say to me ""Gusto, why you drinka milk this way?"" I say I get it from amazon. So know i have to wait another week for my next order to arrive."
2,"Just a bigger version of the original, *still* doesn't multitask....","There's no doubt about it; Tuscan Whole Milk, I Gallon, 128 fl oz looks pretty, and it sure appeals to the wallet in these troubled economic times with a fairly reasonable starting price, but when it's all said and done it's not much different from your original hand-held device. A bigger size, yes. 128 fl oz sure looks great in your hand, and the display is easier on the eyes, (the colors just pop!) but let's hold off on any proclamation that it's going to change the milk drinking industry as we know it, alright? At least until the next generation comes out without all the kinks, and maybe a few more bells and whistles. Like *multitasking*, Jobs."
5,"If I could make milk, this is the milk I'd make.","Tuscan Whole Milk produces analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting prostraglandin. Believe me, the little lady has never been happier. My Mudkips has more hit-points too. If you try this milk, then you, my friend, are made of furious lightning! Don't believe it? Habeeb it!"
1,Fun at first,"I had a friend of mine who is a scientist analyze some of this so-called ""milk."" Did you know that it's 2/3 water?!?! And there was animal tissue in it, like some sort of pus or something. Plus, if you leave it open on your porch for a few days in the summer it will give off the most disgusting smell you've ever sniffed and will eventually become full of maggots. I think it is reprehensible that Amazon is selling this product as something safe to drink and I plan to boycott this website until this product is removed."
1,Milk ruined my life.,I found milk in bed with my ex-girlfriend. When I screamed at milk it kicked my dog on its mad dash out the house.
1,BOOM MILKSHOT,"As most of you may or may not know, Italian milk is teh best. It makes your football shots go farthest and also it turns everything you touch into a fad. When I gave that Italian fella the ol' header a few weeks ago, I was trying to milk him in vain hopes of getting a litre or three out of him. Sadly I failed at life and at milking Italians because I got nothing out of him. So when I saw ""Tuscan Whole Milk"" available at Amazon, I had to get some. It was a sad disappointment, much like the end of my career. NEDM wins teh internets!!!!1!`1~1"
1,Blatant false advertising!,"How the devil was I supposed to figure out that this is cow's milk? Do you think somebody would have the common sense and foresight to tell me ahead of time, before I shelled out my hard-earned cash?Don't waste your time and money, folks. You're still going to have to suck on your wife's nipple the old fashioned way."
5,Excellent blood plasma replacement,"Can be injected directly into bloodstream via IV as an excellent ""pick-me-up"" for patients suffering from severe blood loss."
1,The Milk of Kings,"Having just supped my first tumbler of said milk it is safe to say I have fully broken my Tuscan Whole Milk hymen. I cannot help but feel disappoionted. So disappointed in fact that I felt compelled; no, I felt that IT IS MY DUTY to review this milk for what it is. It is a shoddy and poor imitation of Shepherd Gourmet Dairy milk.It is not, as some regard it ""the milk of kings."" It is a cheap knock-off of a far superior brand. Shepherd gourmet milk, or as I call it, Jesus's Choice"" touched me in a way that nothing could every come close to.DO NOT BUY THIS MILK I URGE YOU, the moustache it will leave you with sinks right to the bone and produces emotional scars and/or tumours.You have been warned,Joe Bradbury"
3,Disappointment on the extension map,"Is quite disappointing on how the expansion planets maps turn out to be. It is actually stickers that you have to stick onto the map. If you want to stick it permanently, you have to slice the sticker into two so that you can fold the board back to keep. Maybe they should have design the the expansion maps in a card board form so that we can just place it on top of the map and remove once we are done playing. Now I have to decide whether to stick it permanently or to make my own card board planets for the game."
5,One of the Best Albums EVER,"This is a free-wheeling trip through joyful Dixieland Music with Bing and top-notch trumpet player Bob Scobey. While the performances are thoroughly professional, there is the sense that you are sitting in on an informal jam session that just happened to be recorded. Bing's relaxed way of swinging and intermingling patter with the syncopated jazz are top-notch. One of my personal favorites is ""Mama Love's Papa."" Another is the ultimate version of ""Dream a Little Dream of Me,"" which ends with Bing plunging down to a low Eb with the all the richness of a freshly brewed Cafe Mocha. Some critics have named this one of the top jazz albums ever. I happen to agree with that appraisal."
2,Bing without a Beet,"This album is OK but I can't appreciate it knowing what it could have been. Originally Bing Crosby expressed an interest in singing with a beet in his mouth, extracting it and then replacing it to manipulate the sound of his voice as a trumpeter does with a mute. His producers did not approve - feeling beets too clearly associated with rural Steinbeck types - and forced Bing instead to opt for a classier instrument more associated with European opulence: a full drum kit with silver rims and all (and not the taut animal hide stretched over a barrel that Bing meekly suggested as a compromise).This is why I can't give this album 5 stars because all I can hear is what this album could have been."
5,Angus music great,"I've seen the movie at least four thousand times :) and I loved the music in it, but I have a question that's been totally bugging me. What is the name of the song that plays when Angus and Melissa do the slow dance at the winter ball? If anyone knows the answer to that, PLEASE email me!"
5,Delightful,"The Angus soundtrack is a perfect cross section of 90s power pop, nerd rock, and punk rock of the period.All of these bands were doing something special, one of them really made it big..."
3,Responding to pavement 517,"Not so much as a review as a response to the question asked by pavement517. The name of the song is ""Fade into Me"". It is by the Mazzy Stars. If the soundtrack had that song on it I would of given it 5 stars."
3,"The track I wanted to hear, while listed was not available.","If you are going to offer previews, please take care to offer ALL tracks on the soundtrack. I am primarily interested in ONE track only and wouldn't you know.....you list it and don't offer it as one that can be accessed. I've got to tell you...that really is a huge disappointment.From now on.....don't offer sound slices of a CD unless you are willing to provide a ""little piece"" of each and every song on the CD.I'm sure that I am not the only frustrated person out here in the real world who has asked this of you.Be kind. What YOU want to hear, may NOT be what WE want to hear. Be fair. That's only right......Sincerely, SeesTruth@aol.com"
3,Green Day Is God,I bought this cd becuz i am a huge Green day fan and this song totally kicks ass. I was dissapointed with the rest of the cd though. The onley other good songs were songs 7-9. The rest were pathetic songs by some nobody bands. ONly get it if your a green day fan
3,MAZZY STAR - FADE INTO YOU,"I WENT CRAZY FOR THIS SONG and couldn't find it on the soundtrack?! Movie was good and when they played it two weeks ago on ""Dinner and a Movie"" the girl said the name of the song! FINALLY. The soundtrack would've been a 5 star if this was on it!"
3,"Cheap, and worth it!","Two of the initial four arrived broken because of poor packaging. Amazon Customer Service sent another box of four, all arriving intact.These are described as ""All-Purpose"" but are really large red wine glasses. They are heavy, and the bases aren't completely flat, so they rock slightly on flat surfaces. They do hold wine, however, and I guess that's the point!"
1,Paperback edition fell apart as I read it,"This edition of Thucydides is really excellent. There are maps and/or images of artifacts on almost every page, along with marginal summaries, and a lot of helpful appendices.However, as I read it (over the course of a week), the book completely fell apart. Every twenty pages or so a large section of the text would break off and fall out of the book. It was horrifying. I've never read a book with such a terrible binding, and I had to dispose of it by the end since it was just a pile of separate sheets of paper."
1,Bad Formating on Kindle,"I am using the Kindle app on an iPad. The formatting for this book is very disappointing. The maps are not at a high enough resolution, when you enlarge them enough to see the details those details, including a lot of the text, become fuzzy. The side notes that are useful in the printed book are part of the text flow in the Kindle version, so it seems like you are reading lots of little chapters. In the book you can use the side notes to skim sections, in the Kindle version they are just an annoying distraction.The Kindle version has no table of contents.Do a preview of the Kindle version and compare it to the printed book.LP"
5,Landmark Indeed,"Like the Landmark Herodotus, this version of Thucydides; work is unparalleled. The maps and the notes, not to mention a brief synopsis of each chapter makes the work fit in its own context.A must by for any ancient historian."
5,A superb book.,"For those seeking to understand the nature of war and human behavior in war, this is the book to read. The story of greed and ambition - and the adverse effects it can have on policy - threads its way through the book. Thucydides' remark, ""I have written this work, not as an essay which is to win applause of the moment, but as a possession for all time"" is a very appropriate statement. The eternity of Thucydides' work is evident in the similarities of policy and war today as compared to the author's world. The numerous maps and footnoting within this book, makes it much easier to comprehend than other accounts of the Peloponnesian War."
3,Review of The Landmark Thucydides,"To be forthcoming, I must note that I genuinely no longer enjoy Greek historiography. Where Herodotus carried on to tangents of varied interest and extravagence, this is a dry, straightforward account. Unless one is interested in a career as a professional historian or statesman, I cannot see the value of reading Thucydides cover to cover. I rue the day I'll do it again.That said, it's important to note that this is likely the best edition of Thucydides on the market. Strassler uses extensive maps, appendices and footnotes to make everything as clear as possible. He makes Thucydides comprehensible, but fails (as, I think, anyone world) to make him truly enjoyable."
5,What a Landmark!,"A completely superlative work! Thucydides wrote, during the infancy of history, a masterful study of the Great War of his time, the 27 year, with one brief interlude, struggle between Athens and Sparta for supremacy of the Greek world. It is a classic that deserves careful study by any student of ancient Greece, war, history or the human condition. Unfortunately it is a work that deals with a complex subject filled with names and allusions obscure to most modern readers. This work , with its extensive background information, dozens of maps and extensive footnotes, makes this classic intelligible to any student. An added bonus is the introduction by Victor Davis Hanson, a classics professor who can write, almost a contradiction in terms."
1,Shame on the Publisher!,"This is a superb edition of one of the greatest books ever written. However, there is a MAJOR CAVEAT: the paperback edition has a TERRIBLE BINDING, and will fall apart on you as you read it, guaranteed. This happened to every student in our class. Such a fantastic edition of a classic should obviously be sewn, rather than glued, but the publisher has apparently tried to cheap it out with an inferior glued binding which, I repeat, WILL NOT LAST. We wrote the publisher as a group, but did not receive an adequate reaponse. By all means, use this edition, but if you want to keep it, BUY THE HARDCOVER."
4,Sensational Sets and Borders,Book arrived in great shape and will be very helpful on my next quilt border project.I'm very excited about trying the techinques in this book.
5,Very entertaining!,"Not only do I feel smarter, but healthier from laughing so much at this entertaining book. Laughter is the best medicine right?!"
5,Electronics For Dummies ( Like Me!! ),Liked his analogies to explain concepts. Made the proverbial light go off for me when it came to understanding electrical components and concepts. Really enjoyed it and highly recommend it as a companion guide for those exploring electrical concepts for the first time...
2,Not for learning electronics,"This book has an easy to read style and it made me laugh in places. But... I didn't learn as much about electronics as I needed. It covers some basic theory in an entertaining way and would make a good read for someone who didn't want to go on with more challenging projects. I got much more value from ""Make: Electronics: Learning Through Discovery"" by Charles Platt which I would recommend.Make: Electronics (Learning by Discovery)"
2,just reading the intro was annoying,"I do not think I can buy this book because I just read the beginnings gets and he jumps around all over the placewith these stories and little cute jokes , etc. Quite annoying!All I want to do is to start learning from the ground up, it is like he wants to tell historic stories and be groovy at the same time on static electricity and took 2 pages of painful reading.I don't think so."
5,An interesting science book to say the least!,I was laughing out loud most of the time reading this nice overview of basic electronics. Amdahl has a really wierd way of getting the concepts across in a memorable way! If you are completely bored by basic electronic textbooks then read this book! Worth every penny!
1,Waste of Time and Money,"If you want a fun way to learn electronics, this isn't it. It sounded interesting, when he was talking about the ""parlor tricks and jargon"", in the beginning. It bombs out seriously, after that. The author should have stuck to one theme. Instead, he jumps around from ""greenies"" looking for women and beer to ducks, buffalos, chickens, turkeys and then, a magician with a sexy assistant. It would have been much better with the little cartoon illustrations that were in a book on electricity that I read in the 5th grade, almost 50 years ago! I definitely, wouldn't recommend this for younger readers, either. Sorry Kenn, you laid an egg with this one."
5,Fascinating,"This book is great. After reading it, I became proficient in electrical jargon and basic electricity. I can understand schematics and I know the differance between alternating and direct current. Every once in a while, I casually slip in a tidbit of information and amaze people. I recommend you read this book."
