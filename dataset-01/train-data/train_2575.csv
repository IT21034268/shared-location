2,Turbo Tax has no customer service,"I've now used Turbo Tax for four years and I'm going to switch. In the past, things went smoothly, so I didn't need to worry about glitches. This past year (filing year 2005), I experienced some glitches and found it impossible to get anyone at TurboTax to answer my questions in any useful way. The software is generally OK, but it becomes useless if you have any problems with it."
4,saved me from the tax man...thank you...,I was behind in filing due to selling some stock and not knowing how to figure it all out. This will do everything it says it will provided you know how to answer the questions...not always as intuitive as a novice might need...but still worth it as now my taxes are done and I know I am sitting pretty!
3,It's OK.,"This CD doesn't work that well for me. Many of the song seem to drone a bit. I think I like vocals that are a little more musical. That said, I still have played this CD multiple times. I guess maybe I like it a little better than I'm admitting. :>)"
3,Feelings,"Feelings is an experimental rock/pop album by the former Talking Heads singer and is an alright release. Some of the tracks are quite witty like Miss America, Finite=Alright and Burnt By The Sun. The problem is that album is quite uneven and some other tracks are not nearly as good. The booklet has no lyrics, a design that looks like photos of dolls in different poses but for each track we get a list of whom plays what. 3/5."
5,Fuzzy freaky FUNk,"This is my favourite David Byrne solo effort since Rei Momo as of mid 2004. (Only because it is hard to compare Rei Momo with its core Latin sound to this eclectic mix.) Fuzzy Freaky never ceases to amaze me.Alcohol no need to fear, rest in these fuzzy arms. (Amnesia)These are the limits to our experience, it's scarry but its alright."
3,"Pleasant, Burt Not Essential","The most arresting element of this CD, unfortunately, is the case itself - with its David Byrne doll photos, oddly laid-out credits, ""David Byrne Mood Computer"" and so on. The music on the CD isn't bad at all, but it seems too much thought went in the wrong direction. The music isn't catchy or intriguing enough to hold heavy interest all the way through. That's not to say there aren't highlights - ""Miss America"" sounds like a REI MOMO track revisted in a more modern setting, ""Dance on Vaseline"" is slippery fun, and I also like ""Amnesia"". But it's hard for me to get too into this album when I know he's done better. Neophytes are advised to start elsewhere (REI MOMO or UH-OH) - growing fans can pick it up without worrying."
2,Cold Feelings,"Despite a share of good songs (the haunting ""Dance on Vaseline"", the dramatic ""Burnt by the Sun"" or the offbeat ""Wicked Little Doll""), this David Byrne effort is not very convincing or appealing. While there`s nothing really bad here, most of the moments are nothing special either. ""Feelings"" is listenable from beginning to end, yet only a couple of tracks rise above average and become memorable. Yes, Byrne combines very different styles as usual, mixing pop, world music, electronica, bossa nova, funk and other influences, but not even that melting pot can save an album that just happens to carry too much filler. Overall, this ends up being a curious yet unecessary record. Not the worse, but there are better choices out there.Forgettable."
2,The Dark Side,"Suddenly, David Byrne uses his powers for Evil instead of Good. Sad, sad, sad. Avoid this one and listen to any other Byrne album (except the self-titled one) and you'll hear an artist when he had something to say and was good saying it."
2,Poor,"I agree fully with ""A music fan"" above ... this and David's self titled album are really poor in comparison to the rest of his solo work. I love most of Talking Heads music but don't rate Remain in Light highly like most fans do."
1,"""Dumb and Dumber""","Words can not begin to convey how badly these jurors were decieved by the Simpson defense team. The fact that they allowed themselves to fall for the ""race card"" antics of Cocharan, et. al. is all the more reason to require I. Q. and logic tests before allowing people to sit on juries. At least with their names, faces, and now opinions known, no other poor family will have to have these people judge their daughter or son's killer.This tape and book does provide a wonderful service showing just how faulty these jurors' logic was."
3,Thought it would say more about the trial,"I have read the books by Marcia Clark and Chris Darden and I was impressed with them. I wanted to get an opinion from the juror's side as to why the decision was made for acquittal, but I was a little disappointed because at least half of the book was about the three jurors' backgrounds. I think that they didn't even mention the trial until page 90 or so."
1,Garbage,I wouldn't even give this book the time of day. Here's a group of people who completely dropped the ball when it came time to do their civic duty and then couldn't wait to cash in on a book deal. How utterly disgusting!! My opinion on the juror's conduct has noting to do with Simpson's guilt or innocence. There is no way these people could've weighed ALL the evidence presented in this trial and come to the conclusion they did in just 3 short hours. Garbage!!
5,Judo Grappling,"I have been doing Judo and Jujitsu for a while and this dvd here is outstanding! Now I have his other dvd as well Judo Complete which is real great but this dvd breaks down all of his steps even more and he goes over his techniques in slow motion. If you are interested in improving your grappling game on the mat of rondori, shai, or even in the streets this dvd is a must."
3,Why Pay More?,"Ted is a great live performer. These ""classic"" live tracks were recorded at various shows, during the late 20th century. For fans of simple straight-ahead rock and roll, this CD is a bargain. Supplement your collection with this album and enjoy.For audiophiles, the listening experience is not optimal. Rather than an even flow from one song to another, you hear Ted talk to a London audience on one song, to a Texas audience on another. The talk distracts from the jams, which aren't superbly mixed, probably because the album wasn't planned out at the time.Also, don't expect liner notes! (You can't read rock and roll.)"
2,NOT IMPRESSED,I READ ALOT OF BOOKS... THIS AUTHOR HAS TOO MANY NAMES AND PEOPLE IN THE FIRST 25 PAGES... TOO CONFUSING AS TO WHO IS RELATED TO WHO ...DOESNT FLOW WELL... TOO MUCH CONCENTRATION AND REREADING PREVIOUS PAGES TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE NAMES INVOLVED...I MAY TRY ONE MORE BOOK---USED FOR SURE... I TRIED GETTING INTO THIS BOOK 4 TIMES AND STILL HAVENT GOTTEN TO CHAPTER 6....SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EASY READ FOR A LAZY WEEKEND THIS ISNT THE BOOK FOR YOU
2,HOME FIRES NOT FOR ME!!!!,"Guess I am by my self but I did not care much for Home Fires. I have read five other books in this series and liked them all. I could just not get into Home Fires. Deborah's nephew, A.K., is caught turning over headstones in a cemetery, then a black church is torched and a body found in the ashes. Was A.K. involved is this too? It seems to me that a big part of the book was spent in talking about Deborah's family. I stayed so confused over whose child was whose and which brother was the 4th born or 2nd born or the third one up from her that I just never got into liking the book. Would recommend skipping this one if you are reading the series."
3,Racial Flames,"HOMES FIRES by Margaret Maron is another ""mystery"" in the Judge Deborah Knott series, but the frequently used racial theme is both flat and dull. Sorry, but I get a bit tired of reading almost with a few turns the same story told over and over by so many.MS. Maron just happened to come in at the end of a long line of similar books and the mystery part seems like an added attraction without strong character development to move the story forward.Maron is a renown southern cozy mystery author and reading all of her books does tell the extended story of one family.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."
4,Fun!,"Memoirs of a veterinarian who travels around the world doctoring rare and wild animals. Ya got your seal pups in Peru, your okapi in Zaire, and, my favorite, your orangutans in Borneo (plus lots of other countries and critters). This was a very enjoyable book, though it wasn't always as well-written as it could've been (a few stilted passages, a few unnecessary ones, etc.). But I didn't read a book by a vet for its literary value, obviously. I read it because I love animals and always wanted to be a vet myself. I would never have had the courage Karesh has, though, which is what makes living vicariously through his stories so much more fun. Recommended to anybody who likes James Herriot and going to the zoo."
4,Perspective of a Vet who respects beings on our planet,"Karesh's contribution to wildlife study is honest and important because he writes realistically and not romantically about the state of life on the planet from his perspective: a member of the caring professions. Thanks for sharing, Doc."
4,Good no lube strip,These are the only decent razors without a lube strip which are always slimey. No longer found in retail.Greg
2,"Okay, but what does it have to do with racing?","I bought this game because my son likes cars. But really, this game has nothing to do with cars. It is a ""matching"" type of game. You just quickly put cards in stacks that don't match any other card already in the stack either by color or item. Whoever does this the quickest with the least mistakes wins.""Top Speed"" isn't a bad game. And it is about speed. But the game could have been about bugs or horses or anything. My son had fun playing it a few times, but it quickly loses its charm. That is no doubt why it is so cheap.I have three other games by this manufacturer that are great--that my kids want to play all the time. ""Top Speed"" just isn't one of those great ones. And, other than the pictures on the cards, it really has nothing to do with automobile racing or even cars for that matter. Okay for the few dollars it cost though."
2,Catz Crash,"Catz 5 messes up my computer! I installed it once and it said that it wasn't installed-so I did it again. And again. And again. When I FINALLY got it all-the-way installed, while playing, it crashed. Crashed my whole computer down. There must have been a defection on it! Overall, I only really got to play it a total of about 30 min. and it was OK while it lasted."
1,"Corniest ""horror"" movie i've ever seen","Corny acting, corny ""special affects""...horrible plot. The 1 star is for the retard eating flesh off a bone. And can anyone answer what the hell kinda animal was in the cage?"
3,Independent Horror Production scores!,Well OK what can I say about a low-budget horror-flick shot on location in North Texas? 5 Stars for effort - but overall I give it 3 stars. Enjoyable flick for teenagers looking for something to rent/watch for a few thrills. Burton Gilliam has the best lines as the Sheriff however the actors who play Fang Lady and her cannibal son I think have the most fun with their roles. Some startles and some laughs make this a fun rental. Seems like there could have been more interplay between Fang Lady and her son. A missed opportunity that would have increased my rating. Recommended rental.
2,Average direct-to-video cheese,"Routine and silly horror-comedy is just another offshoot of Texas Chainsaw Massacre with bad acting but the movie is quite funny and it is worth the rental.The best scene comes from when the man closes a wooden door just like Leatherface did in Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a sliding,metal door.PROS:Decent special effectsHas some funny scenesProduction values were a notch better than independent horror movies.CONS:Bad actingbad plotWorth the rental but not to buy."
2,c r a p,"I gave it an extra star for the leg (femur bone) scene, other than that: bad footage, bad sound, bad acting, bad special effects, bad story line, bad title....not worth a rental (however not as bad as half caste)"
4,Fanglys Rocks,Scary and gross. I liked it a lot. Definitely worth renting/buying. I hope they make more Fanglys.
1,OH YEAH...THE BOMB...MORE LIKE BOMB THIS PLEASE!,"I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST, WORST, WORST, ...DID I SAY... FRIGGREN WORST, WORST, WORST, WORST,...OH HECK I'LL SAY IT AGAIN...THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! MAKES ME WONDER WHY FOLKS WASTE THEIR TIME BOTHERING MAKING A MOVIE! CHRIST I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER FILMING THIS AND IM BLIND, DEAF, AND MUTE... AND HAVE NO ARMS OR FEET! GET THE POINT! :) HAHAHAHA!"
5,Greatest generation here in our town,"Mr. Kiser was one of my Sunday school teachers, more than 35 years ago, so I heard parts of his wartime stories from him directly. This is an inspirational book I am pleased to have on my shelf of favorites."
2,report,This are top notch bearings but to install them .must purchase about 15 dollars of e uipment if u go to zumiez thez are21.95 and they press the bearings in the wheels and install them and thay dont charche u for the nuts washers or the lube they put in the bearings and if u make some friends that work there ull get 50% off
3,It is what it is,"I bought this phone because the warranty was up on my old phone when it died and I needed a phone to fill in until my carrier gave me a new free one. It is a relatively cheap phone, but has proven worthy of a filler phone for a few months until I get another free one when I renew my contract. I am not sure that I would have bought it otherwise, it is similar to phone circa 2006 in screen size and functionality. So if you don't text too much and if you don't do data at all, it gets the job done."
4,bones reds bearings,i have been skating for 5 years and i have to say for the price of these bearings they are well worth the money. i am happy with my purchase. i didn't expect the best but they are a lot faster than i had hoped to get. definitely a great purchase.
4,JUST LIKE BUYING AT A SKATE SHOP,The bearings are 100% legit. The shipping takes like a week or two. They are just like buying the in a store except in the store there like $20 dollars. You should buy these if you need some good bearings for your skateboard.
5,...i heart bones reds... that is all.,"buy them, they're awesome. when u first get them they're fast and then when u break them in they're even faster...weirdest thing i've ever seen but i've asked around and apparently this is standard procedure for bones reds. awesome awesome buy...i'll only buy bones bearings from now on.oh by the way... get the bones speed cream too. i also have the cleaning unit. get both if u have the extra money... protect your investment they'll last longer."
5,Perfect replacements,Perfect to replace stock bearings in your razr scooter for any size. Put them on mine and my little boys and they work great. When you spin the wheels you really see the difference.
5,Great bearings,I have skated for many years and I swear by reds they last and don't break easily. Buy reds there last. trust me.
4,Great value,I'm a roller derby ref and it's hard to beat these bearings. They're a good bearing for a great price. A set usually lasts me for about a year.
5,very good,purchased the stereo cruiser board. the bearings were not very good bought these because of other reviews . very good product
2,Bones reds bearings,"I skate street and park for at least 8-10 hours a week and these bearings all broke or froze within 2 weeks. These were not worth what I paid for. Years ago, these lasted at least a month, but they must be making them way cheaper now."
5,great bearings,These are really great bearings for the price i would also recommend powell skateboards also a great buy
3,You get what you pay for..,"I bought a complete board that came with abec 5 bearings which I found to be too slow. I mainly ride snake-runs, pools and bowls. Slow bearings mean you have to pump like a wild man to reach the lip or just keep your speed, and this will wear will you out quickly. I normally ride bones Swiss, but after reading all the glowing reviews on these reds (the price didn't hurt either) I figured I'd give them a shot. Well, I was a little disappointed to find that they were no faster than the no name, stock set I replaced. I say a ""little"" disappointed cause they didn't break the bank. Like I said in the title... You get what you pay for.."
2,Awesome.. for a short time,"I go these for my 9 two 5 and at first they were great, but after around 15 hours of use I started hearing a horrible noise coming from one of the ends of my board, I thought it was just the truck or the board, but when I was changing the wheels I noticed that one bearing just refused to work well, it looks normal but it almost doesn't spin. After some searching, I attempted to remove the shield, as instructed by skateboardtech, and take a look at it, but it just didn't come off. I was forced to replace it with one of my old bearings. I am furious at bones and these are probably the last bearings I'l ever buy from them."
5,Bones Reds,"These bearings are some of the best bearings for the price of them, they work to there peak and I skate everyday so they definitely hold up very well. They clean very easily and last for the longest time. Great product. Give props to Bones."
4,Good Bearings but....,"Just some quality bearings at a good price, smooth ride and about 10-15 bucks cheaper then local shops but did not come with spacers as shown on the site, would have been a sweeter deal if it did. - singapore"
3,Fragile Bearings.,"I've bought plenty of sets of these over the years. They're not horrible bearings in that they're relatively fast once you break them in, but they're incredibly fragile.The issue with their durability is that the plastic portion which houses the ball bearings and keeps them from touching breaks easily.I don't know why and I don't know how, but it's very common for that plastic piece to crack. A crack in that plastic portion doesn't necessarily cause the bearing to fail though. I have bearings that have lasted for ages with a crack and others which have failed due to the crack. Some bearings just completely fail in that the plastic housing practically explodes and large portions of it crack off and fall out.I can explain the 3 star rating I'm giving this product as such:The product is cheap and works, but you get what you pay for in terms of reliability and the lifespan of the bearing."
4,Bang for Buck,WIth these bearings your definitely getting the most out of your money. These are some of the best cheap bearings out there and they work great!
2,Where are the shields to the other side of all my bearings,Came here faster than expected and good overall packing just have no idea why they all came with only one shield each.
3,Nothing special,"I ordered these bearings expecting the best, but when they came in, I was slightly dissappointed. The bearing only spun about a second in my hand. When I put it on my wheels and spun it, they made this chopping noise. They only spin about the same as my abec 5 bearings and are just a little bit smoother."
3,WHAT SIZE ARE THESE - 7mm or 8mm !!!!?????!!!!,"""ONE SIZE"" is totally worthless!! At the very least what is the INSIDE DIAMETER of these bearings?????????Bones Reds come in 2 sizes 7mm and 8mm ID (the other dimensions being 22mm OD and 7mm width).Read the damn box - it's printed right on it.Other than that the product is excellent and cost competitive."
1,bad,these barrings suck !!! i ride and i always have to push off so many times... they r so slow!! THEY ARE FAKE!!!!!!
3,Red Bones,"These bearings are fast, but they're hard to clean! I've tried alcohol, nail polish remover, gasoline, and WD-40 and it didn't work. Try to keep them as clean as you can and get speed cream!"
4,They rip!,"What can I say....? These bearings are fast and cheap. They do have the shields on only one side, but since they face inside the wheel, no big deal. In fact, it just makes it easier to clean and re-lube."
3,not very impressed with these,i bought these bearings and they lasted me 2-3 weeks and i skate 6 hours a day or more and i wouldnt reccomend buying them. Also when i ride in maybe say some water or something it just gets in the bearigs and slows them down. another thing is these bearing's blew out in a week and i was very dissapointed.
5,the best option,bearings are not something you go cheap on. these are great for the price especially on sale.
2,Great but they don't last,"They are great when you first put them on , i've bought 2 set because i like to collect longboards and they ride so well... for the first month, but you have to order a cleaning kit in order to keep them running smoothly, which is just a money drainer. i would recommend the bones reds ceramic bearings or a different brand before these cheap ones."
5,How can you go wrong?? They're BONES!!,"Look, I really don't know what to say... If you want time tested quality and durability, you buy BONES. These bearings are FAST!! These are what Animal Chin was looking for while we were all searching for him! Buy these!!"
1,Warranty is not what it appears,"Working through an issue with customer service. With a lifetime warranty (and high price) I'd expect the process to be smooth as silk. It's not.**UPDATE**They did eventually 3 months (with biweekly emails/phone calls) after I requested they honor their lifetime warranty agree to repair the pan, that has an MSRP of $300Apparently they have one american based representative who has to get approval from their manager before they can honor the warranty. The representative stated, we'll be glad to send you a product equal to what you paid. I purchased my pan from an upscale store that discontinued the brand (for obvious reasons). So basically my pretty but defective copper pan, would be replaced with a non-defective stainless steel lower quality pan. I highly recommend you either 1 find defects within the return period and return if needed, or 2 avoid Mauviel cookware."
3,Great mixer for beginers,"Well this mixer has its low and high points. The BPM counter is complety worthless, I dont use it anyway. The great thing about this mixer is the 3rd channel! It took me a while to get used to the cue PFL function seems its a crossfader. The EQ is easy to control, and the channel seperation is pretty good. The crossfader feels loose to me. The sound sort of pops up, instead of slowly blending over which i noticed my first time using. Overall this mixer is a great bargin for any novice who wants to explore the 3rd channel arena."
4,No crossfader curve control,"this would be the perfect mixer if there was a xfader curve knob/switch. I really hate the way the xfader is, and it's also too light, very little resistance.Other than the xfader, this thing is perfect. Excellent resistance on knobs and faders. I like the PFL button and all that stuff works really well. Third channel really comes in handy."
2,GLITCHY! Avoid!,"I enjoyed the mixer for the first week, but the BPM Counters BOTH went out and one channel went out within the two weeks of purchasing this item. Reading other reviews, this is a common happening. I returned my mixer and didn't get a replacement.The price seemed too good to be true, and it was."
5,Classic Paul!,"Heart wrenching, fun, clever, beautiful! A must own for a Westerberg fans. My only gripe is the three non-paul songs; you can't have it all but pretty darn close!"
4,Sloppy fun,"This cd has a kind of loose feel, in keeping with Paul's recent solo work and work under the Grandpaboy alias. I heard the first three songs and thought they could have been a little tighter, both in terms of production and composition, but then the cd really picked up steam. Paul's originals stack up nicely next to the Talking Heads' Wild Wild Life, and that's saying a lot because Wild Wild Life is a great song."
5,Thin for Life Daybook,"I read or review on an ongoing basis your ""Thin for Life Daybook""...It is well designed and compact with a spiral binding with inspiring content.As a graphic designer, I am attracted to books which are graphically pleasing, with great layout and especially enjoy your weekly wisdoms"
5,WONDERFUL gift from Andy Andrews,"This is a must have for any person searching for their own meaning of life. Andy Andrews does a miraculous job w/ the writing and flow of the c story. The suspense keeps keeps the reader from being able to put the book down.Andy addresses many issues that most Americans deal w/ today: poverty, debt, financial ruin, personal failure, etc.Any's story is heart gripping and truly puts the important things in life into perspective.Wonderful book for teens and adults alike. You will be blessed by this book."
5,5 Stars not Enough,"Mr. Conley is by far, better than L'amour, I'm not saying Louis is not one of the best, but in my opinion Conley is far better. Now I have read everyone of Mr. L'amour's books and enjoyed them very much. In the book Medicine War the main character George Panther was a Medicine Man and had always help his people with any and all problems. George had great powers. Then enters a stranger all dressed in black with firery eyes. George,s horse beats the black clogged man,s horse in a great race and the stage is set. You will be hard pressed to put this book down. There is not one moment in which your attention will sway.This book deserves a multiple 5 star award."
3,Mistake,"Someone made a mistake either Amazon put the wrong picture up or I was mailed the wrong puzzle. The name of the puzzle is the same and the artist is the same, but the puzzle I received is not a winter scene. Still a nice looking puzzle though."
5,Yarbirds - Ultimate,"Yes, this was a great blast from the past. Some of these songs have not heard for sometime. The disc are laid out from the begining to the end as this band transformed. Nice booklet included, very informative.The Yardbirds are a band that can be credited for the transfermation from early Birtish Blues to modern Rock n Roll. Just look at the members of this band(s) & the lenghty period they played."
4,Rhino Almost Got It Right,"Finally a Yardbirds release that replaces the incredible, yet sonically inferior Raven import ""Over Under Sideways Down"". Remastered in Rhinophonic sound that compares or improves the sound found on the imported Repertoire releases. This would have been a 5 star CD, but the Keith Relf songs belong on another rarities CD. A booklet is included with a lot of interesting pictures and commentary by the late Cub Koda. Also recommended is the book ""Yardbirds: The Ultimate Rave-Up"" by Greg Russo."
4,Quite simply an amazing collection,"OK it may not be flawless but it could have been a hell of a lot worse. The live tracks could've been negotiated better, I'll grant that but I still find it fascinating. There's plenty on here to marvel about. I don't think I can add much to what's been already said but it's definitely the definitive collection to get into The Yardbirds. A worthwhile purchase"
1,a good read,This book held my attention from cover to cover. I found it to be well written and thought provocing.
3,Horse Legends Michael Martin Murphey,"Notb exactly what I was attending, but always nice to listen to"
2,Lispector would turn over in her grave...,"Cixous has been made famous for bringing attention to Clarice Lispector, but unfortunately, she completely misrepresents Lispector's work and uses it in a way completely antithetical to its purpose. Let me make clear that Lispector's work deserves attention, but it is far more intelligent than Cixous can comprehend. Cixous' work is completely disingenuous: celebratory of women writers while at the same time objectifying them. She hides behind obfuscation as a defense against appearing to objectify (at times sexually) Lispector, but her equivocations are nothing more than intellectual smoke and mirrors.My advice. Skip this book, at least until you have read and come to love Lispector's work on the writer's terms. If you have to write about Lispector in academia, sooner or later you need to confront Cixous' take on Lispector, but don't take it for having substance."
4,Relatively standard Screwpull,"I pretty much always use Screwpulls. Though they're surprisingly expensive buyt they just work best.Unlike my previous ones, this one has a rubberized finish to the twisting handle - which is pleasant enough.I didn't have one before, but the included foil cutter addition is actually pretty handy for neatlyand quickly taking off the top of the foil. The foil cutter is the stand which is tidy. However,it's not particularly stable as a stand - not as good as the standalone stands that previousScrewpulls came with. But the result here is tidier keeping both together in less space. I haveno idea how the new red ball on the corkscrew helps, but at least it doesn't hinder"
1,"Terrrible quality, buy better and save your money","This is the third of these we have gone through in recent months. The first leaked after a couple months' use, the second was actually destroyed by the Danco spray head we put on it (the spray head broke, leaving the threaded portion in the hose coupling), and the third shed its stainless steel protective wrap after a month, leaving the soft, vulnerable rubber (and probably cheap) hosing exposed. We will be buying a new faucet now, rather than try to patchwork our existing faucet with any more Danco products.Save yourself the time and money, buy something that works. Though they will replace the parts again and again, who wants to spend that much time under their sink fixing Danco's shoddy plumbing supplies?*crickets chirping*That's what I thought."
3,Why some repeated skits,"While it has some of his recent guesting skits, I don't know why 3 skits are repeated from the 2 earlier ""Best of Will"" volumes. Cheerleader, Dinner Scene & Actor's studio are repeated. It definitely makes Vol's 1+2 better purchases. They should have tried to do a commentary track like with Amy Poehlers dvd."
2,Don't bother,If you get SNL volume one you'll have the best. Vol 2 and 3 are mostly repeats of Vol 1 with a new lame skits.
4,Great,"Everything was great with the movie except for when it showed up, it had scratches on it because it had came loose and fallen out of the case. But it is good other than that."
2,Weak,"Only has about 5 or 6 new skits, and the other 2/3 is already on the previous 2 volumes....can't they find new material? Even though its cheap, not worth buying."
5,"Love it, the outside plastic needs to be more durable!","1 of the best things I've ever purchased! Works great, helps tremendously with tension headaches. The only problem is the plastic cover is not durable enough. I happened to put it on a rough surface and it had a small tear; I'm buying another one for back up already. But this is something I will not live without! Also love the fact that it's made in the U.S. so I don't have to worry about any toxics in the materials."
5,The Perfect Therapy Pad,This pad is the perfect size and the Velcro wrap around is the best. No more searching for towels to cushion an ice pack. This has it all.
2,Doesn't retain heat as well as some claim,"The pad does not retain heat for ""30 minutes,"" as some claim. For me, after about 5 minutes it's noticeably cooler. After about 10 minutes I have to heat it up again, which is easy to do. But people who use this probably have aches in their bodies and don't want to get up every 5-10 minutes to reheat the pack.The pad itself is pretty large, at about 9.5"" x 13.5"", and it stays in place pretty well. It also seems pretty durable. But it just doesn't stay very hot for me, so now it's just a big paperweight."
1,Very dissapointed,"I searched for this pack which seems to be the same one that I have and love, but when placed in the freezer this cold pack freezes solid not like a gel pack should. Not sure if they changed the chemical composition but it is completely different and not very useful for swollen joints."
2,NOT WHAT IT SEEMS...,"i HAVE AN OLD MEDI-TEMP THAT ""LOOKS"" EXACTLY LIKE THIS. IT HAS SERVED ME WELL FOR MANY YEARS AND I WAS ELATED TO THINK THAT I HAD FOUND A REPLACEMENT FOR IT. IT EVEN SAYS ON THE INSERT THAT IT REMAINS FLEXIBLE WHEN FROZEN........FORGET ABOUT IT!!!! UNLESS YOU CONSIDER AN ICEBERG FLEXIBLE (LIKE THE TITANIC DID)."
1,Not soft,Comes out of the freezer solid as a block of concrete. Definitely not flexible enough to meld to your injury until it thaws significantly. I'm going to have to return it.
4,Good Descriptions of Experience,"I enjoyed the atmosphere of the area the author accomplished in his book. I love British Columbia and it made me yearn to explore beyond Victoria. I only wish the book had included more of what his wife's experiences were, since it was a major life change and commitment for them both, rather than such a heavy emphasis throughout the book on the great expertise of the local man who helped him get established. It's an interesting read however, and I enjoyed it."
3,"Not one of Andy Sidaris better movies, but OK","Honestly, if you are looking for a well concieved plot, you do not need to see an Andy Sidaris film. If you are looking for Playboy Playmates, running nude through tropical locations trying to look like serious, then you are right on the money. I bought this video not because Ted Lange (Issac - The Love Boat)was in it. I bought it for Hope Marie Carlton. Miss July 1985 always will have a special place in my heart. She was smarter than most because she married and raised a family in Utah, leaving her brief acting career behind her.This movie takes place in CA on the beach (of course) as two guys get involved in a murder by accident. To get out of the trouble they find themselves in, they turn detective and try to prove their innocence. Film does have a few good turns so see what happens next."
3,Books gives an overview of current research,"The book covers three aspects. Each part is written in a structured way, however sometimes the authors are not completely clear on why they have chosen a certain approach for a problem. The part restoration covers the restoration of old movies with all kinds of flickering and scratches etc. The watermarking part is the most informative, and gives a good overview of the current approaches in this field. The benchmarking and problems that can be seen with benchmarking are good.In many articles the authors will claim that their way of watermarking can cope with lossy compression and attacks, however the authors of this chapter, will demonstrate that this is not so easy.The retrieval covers retrieval in video streams and a new CODEC is handled. This last chapter is not a good overview of retrieval in image databases, as most of the video streaming and compression is handled."
5,If you're commited to the art of singing,"This book is a masterpiece and an essential guide to the art of singing: technically and spiritually.If you want to explore the wide range of possibilities of your vocal instrument - all colors, rhythms and styles, if you want to develop a voice with a full body and rich of expression, if you want to understand, embrace and live the lyrics you're singing: this book is for you! No matter if you're just beginning to discover your singing voice, or are a professinal who wants to polish your performance, if you want to structure your rehearsals or play with all styles of vocal expression - you'll be inspired beyond belief. Truly empowering for everyone who's interested in learning the art of singing."
2,WTF,"This movie had no theme ,pointless shots and some of the worst acting in any independent movie I have seen. The only reason I even give it 2 stars is that I got some laughs out of just how ridiculous it was. I spent most the movie poking fun at the stupidity of it all. But I support the local movie scene so enjoy the money from my purchase."
4,Horrifying Horror Rules,"As an avid fan of classic and indie horror flicks, I can truly appreciate Bone Cave in all it's glory. It contains all the greatest elements from any cheesy horror film on the market ... only done better. It has Blood, Screams, more Blood, plot twists, and One liners galore. The plot, character development, camera work, lighting, and sound track is right on. Kudos to Matthew Brooks for having high ambitions and executing a solid horror film on a meager budget. Bone cave will make you fall in love with the cheese, giggle like a school girl at the one liners, scream like a chick that runs up stairs, and gasp in shock at every twist. Take time and Enjoy all Bone Cave has to offer."
4,An Insight into Air Force Pilot Training,"Scott Anderson gives a very accurate depiction of the rewards and hardships of air force pilot training. It's written in third person but clearly is autobiographical. It spans from his being a civilian to earning his wings and becoming an F-16 pilot. It's very enjoyable and a must-read for anyone considering a career in military aviation. Tragically, Capt. Anderson was killed last year in a plane crash."
1,Broken Within Two Days,"One of the two slider-style fasteners was broken by day two and rendered this case useless. I didn't carry my Vision M around with me and didn't even use it much the first few days -- which goes to show how cheaply made this case is.In addition, it's semi-difficult to turn the unit off and on due to the hinge that juts out quite a bit. Although, if the case hadn't have broken I wouldn't have minded this much."
4,Biotin Revitalizer,I love this product I use it twice everyday and especially when I am applying heat. It dries quickly and does not weigh down the hair. I also use it on my 10 year old around her temples to keep it shiney and revitalized.
4,Good Starting point to move towards lean manufacturing,"The writer based on his classes goes into certain details in showing the importance of the well structured BOM. Case studies goes into a certain level of details to illustrates the points. However, it still remains superficial, if one has to create a new part numbering system and BOM for modern ERP systems such as SAP, the book content may appears a bit shallow."
3,"Tedious, but a good read","As previously mentioned, the ""Pitch by Pitch"" in the subtitle of this book is no lie. Hernandez dissects entire at-bats (not every at-bat, thankfully) and other parts of two regular season games from 1993 involving the Phillies and Braves and the Tigers and Yankees. His preference for National League baseball is evident. Still, he doesn't let this deter him from enjoying the AL game.The good part about this book: It's very descriptive. The bad part about this book: It's very descriptive. Keith's insights are great and I did learn a fair amount from reading this book. That said, he spends too much time breaking down certain plays. Seven pages on the hit-and-run? Four pages on the pickoff? Way too long. Even I don't love baseball that much. Also, he goes way overboard with his use of exclamation points. It seemed like there was five or six in every paragraph.Overall, I mildly recommend this book. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but it's worth a read."
5,A pitch-by-pitch analysis of two baseball games,"Pure Baseball is a treat for the serious, and I stress 'serious' baseball fan who wants to delve deep into the minds of pitchers and batters. This is pretty dense reading material, but Hernandez shares his wisdom in an entertaining fashion. I found myself having to re-read portions of the book, sometimes even using it as a reference."
5,outstanding,"Easily the best baseball education in print that I've ever seen. It's like taking a master's course in baseball. You have an opportunity to almost sit down with a major leaguer and say ""Teach Me"" and he does. Keith has a bit of a weakness as far as pitch sequencing and understanding missed spots, but they are not particularly glaring. His understanding of counts, and situations outside of the count (inning, score, particular players involved etc..) are exemplary. Any serious ballplayer's dream."
2,Inappropriate product at the time! C-,The product marketing was totally out of scope of the purpose I thought it was going to be used for.
4,NASCAR Adrenaline Vol 1,It was very informative and it shows you how nascar are working on safety as well as trying to keep a level playing field.
4,better than its rep would have you believe,"A lot of longtime Mark Eitzel supporters don't like this album, and I can't for the life of me figure out why. Because it's catchy? There are plenty of catchy AMC songs. Because it's poppy? It's not nearly as poppy as his previous solo album 60 Watt Silver Lining. Because he co-wrote and co-produced it with Peter Buck? So what? He's always had friends and supporters more famous than him, and Buck's always had great taste in collaborators. That it's slight? To me it sounds like he plugged his soul into the microphone and started channeling - just like everything he does.Personally, I think this is one of his warmest and most inviting albums. The hooks make it easy to get into, the songs hold up well (my personal favorites are ""Free From Harm"" and ""Stunned and Frozen"") and his vocals have never been better. What's not to like?"
3,Good Bunnymen compilation but lacks complete rarities,"Being a Bunnymen fan since the 80's I've always longed for some of the rarer b-sides that this set has to offer. Unfortunately though, it falls short in delivering most of the peel sessions and some of the live versions still found on vinyl. I feel that much disc space was wasted on the more common songs still available on the back catalogue which deem most of it as a greatest hits + b-sides set. The common songs basically take up 2 discs worth and are very redundant if you already have most of their back catalogue. I would have liked to see a disc devoted to all their peel sessions and maybe a complete live show on another disc instead of live snippets thrown together. All in all though, still a must have for new fans(greatest hits) and old fans (rarities) alike."
1,"Fanstastic compilation, but mismatched Amazon MP3 versions","A fantastic compilation to be sure, but don't by the MP3 download! Amazon cocked it up by putting the Crocodile LP version of ""Pictures On My Wall"" on Disc 1, not the original Single version. There are probably other inconsistent versions lurking here as well."
2,Disappointed,"I expected more from this Echo Box Set, more demo versions of classic songs, different remixes, different lyrics to same songs, all of that. All the Peel songs should have been on the boxset, all the remixes should be on the CD, The Live recording isn't as good as it could be either. I love Echo and am disappointed in the box set."
4,LET CUTENESS RULE,"School is out for summer and that means Miu is over at Chika's trying to copy her vaction homework and making a general nuisance of herself. She gets even more annoying when she brings a video camera to shoot footage for a project and complains that Nobue and Chika's activities are too boring to film! Most of these episodes just deal with the day-to-day lives of the 4 girls and Nobue as they do things like go grocery shopping, visit the beach, and dress up for a festival, but the richness of the characterization, the great voice acting, and the cuteness factor make this an awesome show."
4,Cute and relaxing.,"Strawberry Marshmallow vol.2 is a cute slice of life anime with the 4 girls and Nobue . To me the best episodes in this volume were the sleep over and the festival. In the sleepover you get to see another side of Miu which is very touching and in the festival Miu steals the show when she takes a stab at bartering and selling.The series isn't about fast paced burst out laughing wackiness. Its a relaxed paced humorous , cute show. Some people might not like it because of the pacing , but for myself I liked it."
4,A great techno-dance album with fun lyrics that praise God!,"This CD is loads of fun! The lyrics aren't really deep, but it is a great CD to listen to while just hanging out and messing around. My youth group went on a missions trip for 11 days, and we listened to this CD every day. Our favorite song was ""Jumping in the House of God,"" but they are all great!"
2,video review,this video was difficult to understand because the sound is not the best quality. My 6 year old likes it though and she has picked up some words and phrases but the sound quality is not great.
3,ok if you know french and can teach alongside,"This is ok for a supplemental resource as you teach your child french, but alone it has some drawbacks. WHile the authentic french speakers are appreciated, it would be nice if the words were said in a slower and more deliberate manner when they are very first introduced or at some point in the process. Also, Andre, the host who is dressed like a tree (this seems a bit odd, even if the DVD's are made by Language Tree), speaks in english and tries to say the few french words he says with a horrible american accent. He is a bit of a distraction for me- maybe more me than my child! I really like the interactive part, but as I said in the beginning, just know that you really need to teach each lesson ahead of time by introducing the words little by little on your own to your child throughout the day and then use the DVD one lesson at a time as reinforcement after that."
3,"okay, but there are much better options","We bought a few french teaching dvds for our son, and this movie is alright.. The french is spoken so quickly (like at a regular pace) that it's very hard to understand/learn. I know some french and I still struggled to follow. I would recommend the Bonjour Les Amis videos before this, or if you have the money, get Muzzy. It's an amazing program; much more captivating for children than these other movies. (and you get french, spanish, german, english, and british english all in one set. :)"
3,"Pretty good, but pricey","Overall, this DVD was pretty good. Here are the things I did and didn't like. I gave 3 stars b/c the cons outweigh the pros.Pros: the DVD has an interactive function (e.g. true or false), which tests understanding.Cons: (1) too much English; (2) too short; (3) overpriced; and (4) the sound is not all that clear."
5,Keepin it Real!,"When I opened the pages of Stages of a Woman, I had no idea I was about to be taken on such a real journey! I read the entire book in one sitting. I just couldn't put it down. I could actually experience the heart wrenching emotions portrayed in each character. Being a Black woman isn't easy. How refreshing it is to find a book that tells it like it is and then gives hope for a brighter tomorrow. I would recommend this book to all women who are struggling with life and its many unsettling issues. You will laugh, cry, and give praise to God as you take a journey through the pages of Stages of a Woman. It's a real winner!"
2,The Crow,"The Crow: Vengeance collects issues 1 - 3, 5 and 6 of Todd McFarlane's Crow comic series. It follows Eric Draven, star of the original graphic novel and film, through his revenge and then further.Jon J Muth does a great job of writing this, and the artists, Jamie Tolagston and Paul Lee, also have talent. Unfortunately, the idea behind the series was not so good, and eventually the series was cancelled, after issue 10.Book, II, ""Evil Beyond Reach"", is also available now."
5,Best champagne bottle sealer in the world,"I purchased this product at a wine store 17 years ago. As a lifetime champagne enthusiat, I declare that nothing compares to this product. I have travelled the world and tried dozens of other sealers to medium -at best- reviews. This is the one I keep at my locations, and the one I gift to my special people."
1,Or you could get...,"This gets you 20 episodes at 400 minutes for almost $30 or you could buy ""Best of Jack Benny"" that has 40 episodes and is 1260 minutes for only $6 through Amazon. It's a great show either way but make the most of your money."
5,Kept grandson busy all day!,This pogo stick was for my 6 year old grandson and his mom said it was a big hit and the kids played with them all day the day after Christmas.
1,Pay attention to the weight!,"It was a very disappointing Christmas Eve. We gave the grow to pro to our 2 Grandsons. I thought grow to pro would be just that. Unfortunately, both my Grandson are over 60 pounds and neither one can use them."
5,great exercise for kids,My twin 7 year old hyperactive boys love this thing - they have spent countless hours in the last few weeks hopping on it. We have only used it with the larger base but they are getting good enough at it that I think I might be trying to remove it in the next few weeks. The amount of energy my boys can burn on this is awesome. It seems very sturdy and it has not had any problems putting up with the abuse doled out to it.
4,Christmas gift.,We had these when we were kids although the foot design is different. This one should last longer than those of 55 years ago and might be safer to boot.
3,fisher price grow,"Bueno para mantener a los niños ocupados jugando en áreas como parques o lugares adecuados para andar con seguridad, buena presentación del embalaje"
4,love it but scare,i love it even my kids love it but i feel scare sometime may be they can fall...its good but make too much sount ....kids really enjoying it
3,Very low weight limit!,"There is a 60 pound weight limit on this pogo stick. My son is almost 6 and he's tall so he's already at 60 pounds. So far it works ok, but I dont know how long he'll be able to use it. Certainly not until he's 10, like the write up says.The toy is also very noisy when used. And after a few bounces my son gets tired of it."
2,watch out!!!,"I just wanted to give everyone a warning that there was a voluntary recall of this product. Any ""Grow-To-Pro"" pogo stick manufactured after August 2007. Apparently a few children have gotten facial injuries. According to the report I saw, one child actually needed stitches.Supposedly, the stick gets stuck in the down position and releases without warning, therefore causing injury if you're not ready for the release.I'm not writing this to deter anyone from purchasing this product, I just wanted to make parents/grandparents aware of the issue. Like I mentioned previously, this was a VOLUNTARY recall. Not mandatory!Happy (safe) Jumping!"
2,Grow to pro pogo,This pogo stick was the most appropriate I could find for a 5 year old who weighs around 35#s. My grand-daughter likes it but must position it next to a chair so she can hold on to the chair while pogo-ing. She does not have enough weight to get the bounce she needs to really pogo with this stick. I would recommend this stick for children who weigh more than 35#s.
5,awsome kid pogo,this toy was so awsome when i got it i couldnt stop bouncing on it i had it for about two years when a part of the bottom broke but we just stuck a screw in and it was good as new you cant way to much if you wana bounce but still i loved it and it easly deserved five stars
3,"Great Preparation Guide, not a getting around guide","What we love about the national geo series is that they entice you into getting ready for your trip. the photos, proposed walks and drives - these get a 5 out of 5. However, they are not good for finding a reasonably priced place to stay, eat, shop and in general finding your way around. For this I recommend a good road map and the Lonely Planet guide. We did 14 days Italy driving from Rome through Tuscany to Florence and the Nat'l Geo guide was essential for planning the trip."
4,GREAT book!,"This book is a wonderful companion to any trip to Italy. The pictures are beautiful (what I would expect of National Geographic) and the information within the book is full of history. We went with a tour group and from reading the book, we were a step ahead on the guides information many times. It also suggests not only the major tourist sites to visit, but also out of the way sites that you might not hear about otherwise. I did give this book four stars because, like another reviewer said, it doesn't give too much information on accomodations and where to eat. Other books may be better for that.The best thing about this book is that you can use it as a book of memories because of the pictures. I highlighted all the places my mom and I went. Hopefully I will return and hightlight the entire book!"
5,"Great guide for where to go, what to see, great itineraries, & pictures","This is a great planning guide for where to go, what to see, and great itineraries. It is organized by region and is a nice blend of history, culture, and scenery. It provides some great pictures to wet your appetite. If there are choices of some great things to visit in a region, it tells you the best options and may also offer some great out of the way places that are nearby (like a beautiful waterfall that is a short walk from where you are). That said, it does not tell you much info on where to stay, where to eat, and what hours places are open for. That I would use another guide for."
5,This album would make Marty Robbins proud.,"Tim Ryan has released one of the best modern western albums ever. Each song will bring visions of the old west to mind. He is not only a great singer, but he writes his own material. Super album!"
4,More Incredible Orb Remixes!,"This is a very worthy follow-up to Vol. 1 of the Orb remixes, which came out a few years ago. What's great about these remixes is that the songs basically become Orb songs, with only snippets and pieces of whatever original they're working with. So, basically you can look at this as a new 2-CD Orb release, even though many of the tracks on here are quite old. Typical great Orb beats, ambient washes, great sound and spoken word samples. A lot of these are pretty hard to find, so this is a great collection! The Meat Beat Manifesto remix of ""Radio Babylon"" alone is worth the price, plus there's remixes of artists as diverse as System 7, The Grid, Lisa Stansfield, Can, and many more! If you like the Orb, run to your nearest record store and pick this up!!"
1,disappointed!,"After reading the reviews on this product, I was expecting an awesome eye cream. Instead it was just average. It did nothing for fine lines or anything else. I would not recommend or purchase again."
4,colman hawkins in concert 1962-64,"an excellent dvd,i particularly liked the 1964 section due to the addition of harry edison in splendid form!also jo jones and sir charles thompson though hawkins playing is more restricted than in the""62 concert,due,apparently to breathing problems.."
4,Caveat emptor- a fine book in a new cover,"For anyone who owns the second edition with the tern and chick on the white cover, this is just a re-covering of that book. Same good, useful, unchanged reference content, different cover."
3,bird identificatin,"we absolutely love the information, but sadley the color is not helpful in allowing us to truely identify the eggs"
5,Great addition to any birder's library,"This is not a book to sit down and read. It is a great reference for any nature lover, beginner to expert, who may find a nest or egg and wonder whose it is. Illustrates subtle differences between species. Well organized."
2,good plot but,"I liked the characters and the storyline went very well. Baby Marley was too adorable. But this ok read is limited because of inconsistencies (initially the baby was thin and scrawny and suddenly the baby was chubby.duh).....and the redneck dialogue. Tedious to read ""maw"" and betsy's garters, etc... for 200 pages.Frankly the characters were too good for that type of sterotype stuff. I found it demeaning. Where y'all is delightful, the maw thing goes to distillary south..........sorry linda."
5,Works great,"I have a 2003 Toyota Tundra with a Sirius radio I added. I've been using a tape deck input which has horrible sound quality and discouraged me from using Sirius radio. The install wasn't too difficult, under an hour. I was a little skeptical when first ordering but I think it was worth the time and money. I'm happy to have a clean and clear input for my Sirius radio. It only comes with what you see in the photo, no RCA to Stereo jack is included."
5,Works as expected,Very quick to install and works as expected. I did accidentally pul the antenna wire from the stereo so go to remove and install a 2nd time! ;)
4,Pretty straightforward,"Purchased this for my first gen '05 Scion. Installation went pretty well and took less than 30 minutes. I honestly believe this is a lot better and cheaper than the solution that Best Buy offers with their iSupply car install kit. Last I checked, that cost about $150, but it does include installation, if you're too afraid to get down and dirty with your car internals.I suppose the only thing I would wish to be included is some double-sided strips so you can stick it where you need it. But other than that, it's a good purchase. Been working for months and hasn't failed yet."
3,Does not work with '03 Matrix,"It looks really easy to install just plug into the CD changer slot. However it is the wrong size for our '03 Toyota Matrix. It says it will work, but it doesn't."
5,Easy to Install,"I purchased the converter for my '05 Toyota Corolla. Not only was it super easy to install, but the sound quality is great. I mostly use it to listen to my Sirius Radio but I can also plug it into my iPod with ease.Here are a couple of things that concerned me before I purchased it. I don't do anything electrical with my car so I was kind of nervous to do this myself. I found some websites that showed me simple step by step ways to take my car radio out. Just google it and you'll find it. It took me a whole 30 minutes to do everything.Another thing that I was nervous about was that I only saw that this converter works with a CD Changer. My car doesn't have a CD changer, I just have a CD player. But when I took out the Radio out of the dash, I saw where to plug it in. To listen to the Sirius or iPod, just click the CD button twice and BOOM, the display changes to CD1. So YES, it works for both a CD Changer AND single CD player."
2,Maybe it's just a poorly designed toy,"I'm not sure how you're supposed to use this toy, but I can tell you how my 2-year-old used it. She struggled with the pop-top for a little while, then realized that she could unscrew it, and after she did that, she poured out all the color directly into the bathwater. Then she looked at me and said, ""Daddy, fix it!"". After that, I opened the pop tops for her, but it's still an awkward toy to use -- too stiff to squeeze easily, and you have to keep the point down while writing, which is not too easy for little kids. I asked my wife what I was doing wrong, and she just said, ""maybe it's just a poorly designed toy."""
1,Awful bath crayon,"You absolutely can not write with these. It's bath paint in a drippy bottle that won't stay open. There is no way the kid on the picture made that drawing. My six year old, who is very dexterous, can barely use these. Buy bath crayons if you want to write in the bath but do not buy these. They are horrible."
1,AWFUL,"Absolutely terrible product. I can't believe they're ripping people off with these piece of crap ""paint crayons"". They just drip everywhere. My 2 and 4 yr olds were baffled and frustrated. The pictures are something you couldn't accomplish in a hundred years.. Why would ALEX sell such a terrible and misleading product? Very disappointed!!"
4,My kids actually enjoyed this toy,"My son who is 3.75 years old spent the last hour in the tub writing and cleaning, something I usually have to fight him to do. I am kind of in awe at some of the reviews for this, yes its made out of plastic but so is most of the crap you put in your shower, its essentially soap but it has a paint consistency. I wasn't looking for a picasso type masterpiece just a couple of clean kids and not to have to fight them in. I got both so five stars on that aspect, my son actually used the provided duck sponge to clean his artwork from the tub which was a win win for both of us, clean kids and a half clean shower. My daughter who is 18 months was less interested in this but she was more interesting in finger painting over her brother's designs. Which kept them both busy for close to an hour"
1,Junk - waste of resources.,"My kids opened this toy this morning for Christmas and were excited to use it tonight at bath time. Like all the other reviewers have said, the pop top is fussy and when you do get it open enough to write with, the colored soap 'ink' just drips down the tub wall. Total crap product; the manufacturer should be ashamed at creating something that is so immediately destined for the landfill. If you've ever seen the Adbuster's fake ad for ""bric a brac,"" this is it - Open it up and throw it away!"
4,Devil's Shadow,"I thought this was a good book, but the first review isn't about this book. This is what the one I found is about. ISBn's match.Back Cover:When Charlotte met Craig at Sandowne races she was 22 to the 16 she had been when they first met, but she is still in love with him. And this time he seems to love her also.She cannot forget the first time she met him, when her sister brought him home to the Abbey six years ago. It had been love at first sight, but his interest had been with her more glamorous sister Verity.As Charlotte and Craig got reaquainted and fell in love it seemed like their happy ending was just around the corner. And then, Verity came back on the scene, just as glamorous and determined to win Craig back from Charlotte."
3,"Just patterns, no instruction, per se","Just a bunch of patterns...oh, well. I was expecting a little bit more. Would have liked to see more instruction with the walking foot."
3,Another quilting design book.,This book was pretty much a waste of time. Most of the patterns are available on the internet.What was I thinking?
4,Don't judge this book by it's cover!,"Dover's Continuous Line Quilting Designs Especially for Machine Quilting, is a truly terrific book. Although the picture on the front is a little dated and this book was originally printed in 1984, these patterns are classics, and this publication offers so much more that the continuous line patterns. There are 86 patterns, including border and all over patterns in geometrics, florals and so forth. It covers subjects such as advice on combining patterns, and fitting them to your specifications, resizing and fitting around squeezy corners. These patterns are designed for continual flow without too many stops and starts. There is an extensive explanation in easy to understand terms on how to use the book to gain the most from the publication."
4,Girl-loving photographer... a great job!,"Bob Cummings plays a lady's man photographer of beautiful women. It is funny to see his male chauvinism 1950s' style and charm turned on for every model who comes into his studio -- all quite politically incorrect by today's standards. But that is part of the humor. Not for femininazis, liberals, and other stodgy types. His grandpa, also played by Cummings, is a ""dirty ol' man"" who outdoes his son in womanizing, athletics, and endurance, even to swiping one of his son's own dates, a model who is done with starving herself and eager to eat anything fattening. Nancy Kulp plays her usual role as a man-loving plain jane, who wants to be one of Bob's lovely beauties. Secretary Shultzy, played by Ann Davis, tolerates Bob's numerous escapades with a degree of her own humor.Rosemary DeCamp plays Cumming's sister who lives with him and her grown son, who admires his uncle's success with beauty queens. But Grandpa is steals the show whenever he is in it."
1,Poor,Not what I expected. Not what I remember when I was a kid. I watched this in reruns when I was a kid and it seems different.
4,Bob Cummings show,I love watching the episodes of Love that Bob that I watched when I was young! It is fun to remember when!
5,My most used bean book,I've used this book for around 10 years. I own a number of bean cook books but this is the one I go back to over and over.
1,Not Lean for these Beans,"Very few of these recipes are lean. Many recipes have up to 30 grams of fat. When I fix bean dishes, I want to improve my health not give myself a heart attack. This recipe book has adequate recipes for beans, but the title is very misleading, most every recipe is very fattening and not too good for your heart."
1,thumbs down,I have to admit I only made 2 recipes in the book. Both were bean soup recipes and they were both tasteless. I followed the recipe exactly as I am not a good cook. Perhaps there are some good ones in the book but after 2 tries I'm returning it to the library.
3,"Decent,...but I wouldn't use it alone","I bought this with the Rick Steve's France book because I couldn't decide between the two. Everyone told me that Lonely planet guides are great...but I have watched Rick Steve's shows on TV. Lonely Planet France was okay...but, it lists like 10 hotels for each area, 10-15 restaurants to eat in each area, whereas Rick Steve's France narrows it down to 3 or 4 hotels/restaurants that you must try. Lonely Planet is fine...and it is helpful, but I use it in conjunction with other guide books."
2,No section on tipping,"Lonely Planet guidebooks range from excellent (Thailand) to less than mediocre (France). I found the France guide to fall short, especially because there is no section on what constitutes an appropriate tip or gratuity at a restaurant. While there were many useful and interesting tidbits of information (the text box on Cemetaire Pere la Chaise for example) the absence of any mention of tipping jaded me against this particular guidebook."
2,You did a great job,"I had planned all my trip with this book. I had revealed that my friends (even those who live in Paris) didn't know about the existence of many Parisian places. The book gave me the info.The info about hotels in Paris as like as in provinces was exact and helpful. Opening hours, prices and so on are mostly right.Thanks for your great book."
4,Excellent Guide,"Lonely Planet makes excellent travel guides. This one is no exception. As is the case with all similar travel guides, it is a bit cumbersome because of its size but that isn't a a result of wasted space. Its full of useful information and tips."
4,Nice travel research guide,"I have not been to France, but I do plan to go there one day. As such, I got this guide as a ""primer"" to understand the basics. As someone who has not been to France, I found the basic information helpful: information about trains, money, etc.I am not the kind of traveler that likes to stick to the tourist traps, and one thing I like about this guide is that it does not restrict its content to those types of areas. However, based on what I have heard from others who have been to France, this guide is not at all comprehensive.I find the content on restaurants helpful, but I will probably rely more on online reviews for hotel selections. In all, I find this more of a pre-travel reference volume than anything; something that I will use to help plan my trip."
4,Great Guide for the Serious Traveler,"I am a fan of the Lonely Planet series because they cater to the serious traveler. If you are a budget to mid-range traveler, these books are for you, though they do include a few ""splurge"" hotels here and there. The book is thorough and covers a number of smaller towns and more out-of-the-way places, rather than just highlighting a few popular tourist destinations as it seems too many books do now. If you are going to France for a week or more, I highly recommend this book, as it is better than those from other publishers for such a trip. If you are just going to one city for a weekend or a few days, it is still a good guide. However, where it really shines in comparison to other guides is on extended visits."
5,you get a lot of information for your money,"The April 2011 edition of lonely planet France is over a thousand pages, densely packed with photographs, information, maps, and reviews. It is well organized, with sections on planning your trip, understanding the country and culture, and a ""survival guide."" It contains sections for each of the regions of France, and the book is highlighted with must-sees and interesting anecdotes. If you're planning a trip to Paris alone, you probably wouldn't want this guide -- as it is fairly bulky and not something you can easily tuck into a pocket. If you're traveling throughout the country or you want to do more extensive reading about the country, this is a good bet. Comprehensive, well-organized, up-to-date, and highly recommended!"
1,3 strikes,"We used Lonely Planets for holiday travel in southern France for the first (and possible last) time. The recommended restaurant of Peter Mayle fame, Gu et Fils, on Frederick Mistral in Aix was either a typo or non-existent as we located the street but no restaurant to be found. Restaurant Le Merou Bleu of Marsailles was a mediocre tourist trap with despicable service. The impersonal nature of the LP recommendations for hotels merely define the facilities, but do not say enough about the character or level of cleanliness. We checked in (and out of) one of Lonely Planet's recommended two star hotels in Avignon and for about five euros more per night, found a potential three star hotel that was much better siutated, cleaner, bigger and quieter."
2,Needs Improvement,"This book is fine for nuts and bolts ""how to use the phone in France"" type information, and it may be ok for travellers on a rock bottom budget. However, my travelling companion and I were not satisfied with the quality of information provided in the book. For example, descriptions of directions to different attractions were frequently available only from metro and train stations instead of from major highways. In addition, it seemed as though the reviewers had not eaten at most of the restaurants they recommended. Finally, there was no mention whatsoever of several of the towns we visited, such as Vitre and Fougeres, both of which are reasonably large towns in Brittany. I know a guide can't include every city, but I later found these two were included in most other guides available. Next time I go to France, I will be using a different guide."
2,"Try another guide, like Rick Steves'","Boy was this book a disappointment. Other LP guides weren't this bad. It seems this book only tries to get you to those places every other tourist is at, and only by public transportation. It skips out-of-the-way places that locals know and love, chooses hotels in noisy central sections of larger towns only. Worse, my 2002 edition still didn't give costs in Euro! Thanks to friends living in various areas of France, I was able to visit wonderful places that aren't even mentioned in the book. Restaurants were poorly chosen, and almost always tourist traps. If you rented a car (which is a really smart way as a group) you won't find any info in this book about getting around, or doing such duh! activities as wine-tasting routes, swimming holes, you-pick farms, sound-and-light shows. LP, if you're reading this: ever heard of the Puy-du-Fou? Everyone in Europe seems to have been there!"
1,Kindle version a huge disappointment,"As a 7 year expat, I've used many Lonely Planet guide books. I bought the Kindle version to replace the pdf version I downloaded 2 years ago. I thought being able to read it on my windows netbook (without Adobe reader & its security problems) would be great. This Kindle ebook is not usable without a pdf reader. Also, I don't like its layout. I expected a book, not some sort of interactive something, for which I must download separately innumerable maps.France Travel Guide"
4,Solid Information,"1000 pages of tidbits about France, small enough to be reasonable to carry but certainly not as portable as the Lonely Planet guide to Austria (360 pages) which I have.Amazon lists it as a ""Full Color Country Travel Guide"". While that is true, it does have color photos, but there aren't many of them. The maps are clear and readable. The ""pull out"" Paris map can't be used without removing it from the book.I definitely prefer Lonely Planet over Frommer's.Lonely Planet uses colored edges (all in dark blue) to mark different sections so this may help speed your flipping quickly to a section.For planning a trip, I would advise buying multiple different guides, the cost is trivial compared to the overall cost of a trip to France and each brand of guide has different information."
5,Best France guide book,"I have used this guidebook on my first visit to France. It is a distinguished guide. This guidebook has better maps than any other guidebook I have used when travelling through Italy, Spain, and Holland. I explored several places listed in the book, and it helped make France an experience to remember. You won't need any other book for France if you get this one."
5,books of eternity,Even if i am not on the level to judge a book of Rabbi Saul Weiss-and the rabbi certaily does not need my approbation-I feel it as my obligation to highly praise his books to any jewwho wants to appreciate the wisdom of our chachamim [our rabbis]in a way that is made crystal-clear.the books contains short quotes from the talmud with beautifullexplanations and comparisons with other similar quotes in other parts of the talmud.To any jew reading english i would recommend buying the books [2 volumes]and studying them.
5,Excellent resource!,"For those of us who can't always think of meaningful things to discuss at mealtimes, this book offers wonderful suggestions. It is especially geared to the Christian family who eats together at least once a day. I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, but there are lots of them and they are grouped by menus with suggested topics to talk about. I would highly recommend this book!"
5,Happy Customer,"I am an amateur photographer and this is the first light I have purchased. I am very pleased with the results. It is small and easy to set up. The only issue I had was that it did not come with the bulb, and I had to order that after receiving the lamp. But, I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Great workhorse light...a legendary product,"I was using Tota lights when I started in television more than 35 years ago. They're extremely well-made, do the job, and last forever. You can't go wrong with these lights. Pricey? A bit, yes. But if you know anything about lighting, you know you get what you pay for. If you need a broadbeam light for umbrella use or simply large-scale illumination, this is the one for you!"
3,more non-fiction than fiction,"i found this book to be a bit disappointing. the descriptions about it sounded like it was going to be an adventure story of some sort about a boy and his horse. in reality the book reads more like non-fiction, with the narrative taking a definite second status to factual information about gauchos on the pampas of south america and their way of life, including their work, what they wear and eat, and how they entertain themselves. the information isn't very detailed, but as an overview for children it has vivid images, although younger readers may get bored at the lack of sustained plot and conflict."
3,Shipping method didn't work,"I'm sure I would have enjoyed this bike, but when I received it (late) the box was damaged. Holes in a couple of places had evidently allowed small parts to disappear from the box. Consequently I was unable to assemble it. I was so disappointed. I had to send it back. I chose to order a bike from a different company which charged a small shipping charge for UPS instead of shipping through amazon which used the post office for delivery."
5,wife's bike,"I bought my wife this bike because I have one and I wanted us to be able to ride together. After assembly and making minor adjustments, we are now riding together. Couples that play, excersize, and pray together, stay together! We are heathier and happier and look forward to riding. She likes the bike as well and the gear changing is very easy for her.Huffy makes a good product.Thanks"
4,The Crime & Punishment of I.G. Farbin,"Without I.G. Farbin Hitler could not have come to power. It is interesting how U.S. industry giants initially aided Farbin and the extent to which Farbin became corrupted. The comapny was broken up after the war and became: Hoescht, Bayer, and BASF."
1,Not a useful resource for those interested in chronology,"Dodge puts admirable effort into presenting a collection of excellently preserved tin cans. However, I cannot recommend the result to the serious researcher! The descriptive information was not useful. Yes, the photos are ""pretty"" to look at, but if your interest is in manufacturing dates or length of use, this book will only disappoint. The book's descriptions gave only manufacturer and estimated value - not date or patent information. I bought this book because the title ""Antique Tins"" seemed to suggest it would provide useful information, but that is not the case. I returned the book."
5,Very informative and a must for the tin collector.,"A book that every collector should have on hand. Helps identify, grade and value your tin. Great wish book. Would highly recommend to all."
1,Unhappy,"I was unaware that this book was so old. I guess I should have looked at it better, it's up for sale."
3,Just another collector,I borrowed this book and the other two in collection from library first to see if I wanted to purchase. I do not. The variety (you need all 3 books) and photos were wonderful. But NO DATES. You have absolutely no idea when any of these tins were made. I personally want some idea even if rounded out to decade or two. If this is not as important to you as it is me than great book.
5,You need to get updated,Dodge Books II (1998) and III (1999) are already in print. You folks are not staying abreast of the field.
5,Works and Made in U.S.A.,"Great price, easy to scrape shavings and a good flint for striking. best of all, package says made in U.S.A.What's not to like!"
1,"Maybe I got a bad one, but this flint is awful","Magnesium is magnesium and any block will be the same. So if there's anything special about this, it would be the flint. Maybe I got a bad one but I cannot get a ""shower of sparks"" with this flint with anything I'd normally go camping with, let alone the much smaller set of things I'd call essential survival gear.I've used the back of 3 different blades to drag across the flint with pressures from light to very hard and varying angles. After that didn't work I tried dragging the edge of the blade of a knife I didn't care about and that didn't work either. I did eventually get the magnesium started by dragging a dull knife edge across the flint, but this is not something I would normally carry with me.So I'd say get a magnesium block that comes with a striker as scraper as well as a flint instead of this one. It's better than putting wear on your knife for this anyway."
4,"Good, Time Permitting","This product works great, I have used it many times to start campfires in the wilderness. Regardless of conditions, this will never let you down, even if submerged in water, just dry it off, and it works. The only downfall is that you will need to scrape off a lot of magnesium for it to do any good. So, if you don't have a lot of time to spend scraping, you're better off with waterproof matches. But keep this in your pack just in case."
2,Good until broke,"With a little practice you can very quickly start a fire with less hassle then plain fire steel. You don't actually need a giant pile of shavings to start a fire if you have gathered the correct kind of tinder. Enough shavings to cover a dime would be sufficient to get a moderately dry tinder ball to start going.There are cons to this product though. I have owned 3 of these, and of those three 2 had the fire steel come lose from the magnesium brick (the other was lost in a lake). Yes you can just glue it back on, or keep it lose, but that's not the type of reliability that I'm looking for in this type of tool (obviously this is for survival situations, or you would have matches or a lighter). I much prefer just a plain old fire steel with striker for reliability sake.A side note is that the fire steel will burn the finish of your knife, so I suggest getting one with a striker for practicing."
4,Staple for each of my packs,"I purchased several of these repackaged at WalMart (though they still say Coghlan on the brick) as well as one at Amazon. Rather than rehash what the other reviewers have said (which is essentially accurate) I'll just say it works if you do what you are supposed to do. I keep one of these in each of my various packs (3-day bag, Camelbak HAWG, Camelbak Ambush) as you never know when you might need a fire. Yes, your handy lighter might work, but if its out of fuel, the weather is bad, etc. this little gem will still get 'em started. 4 stars instead of 5 as it would be better if it came with a small piece of metal for the stiker/shaver."
2,Only in an emergency,"Makes a very nice spark but it is tough to shave the other side. It is very hard to keep the shavings in a pile, especially in any wind, and they burn very quickly so you need a lot to get tender to catch. In an emergency if this is all you have you can get it to work but for regular fire starting duties stick with something else."
1,You get what you pay for.,You get what you pay for. It makes the same amount of sparks as a generic Bic lighter with no fuel. You will be lucky to ignite gas. only makes sparks 1/2 inch or so and very few at that.
4,Fire starter,The fire starter is new and light. I have not use it yet but I will. I hope it will work. I give four stars.
4,better than fire steel,"At least to me anyway. I complained that the tinder you need for a fire steel has to be small and dry and works much better with an accelerant like char cloth or cotton with petrolium jelly. The mag bar has it's own accelerated tinder built right in after a few practice trials, you should be able to ignite the magnesium with a few strikes if you can not with just 1.Have a small pile in some collected tinder and once the pile is going it stays hot long enough for the tinder to flame up.for 8 bucks try it out at least for fun anyway."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought making a small pile of magnesium shavings then striking would almost instantly catch. Even with tender. But the fire steel didn't shower sparks like I thought or saw in video reviews. Maybe I was doing it wrong. I ended up adding another starter(hand sanitizer) and trying the striker. It worked, but the bic lighter did a better job, even the ones without fuel in them."
2,VERY difficult to use.,"For a grown man in his thirties, these are very difficult to scrape enough magnesium off to make a large enough pile to start your fire with. The flint rod is glued on to the magnesium bar, however it seems to be very sturdy. Don't consider this as a primary means of fire starting, consider it an emergency-last-resort. Young teenagers would find this very difficult to use. Not recommended for a Boy Scout backpack. However, these were inexpensive, and they seem to be made well enough. I bought these from the seller ""ToolPrice"", and received the knock-off brand ""SE Magnesium Fire Starter"" instead of Coghlan's brand."
3,Dificult to make fire,"You need to choose very carefully the material that u want to make fire on, the start its hard to make."
1,Wasted My Money,I struck this fire starter about 10 times and it was already gone. I looked at it and it looked like one that i bought a year ago and used a countless amount of times. I left it alone for some time. I struck again and about 3 sparks came out. I was extremely disappointed with this product.
5,magnesium fire starter,"I have used these before, they are an excellent emergency firestarter, scrape some of the block and strike a spark with theattached flint. Good in a personal or vehicle emergency kit.Arrived on time, as promised. Good seller."
3,Needs inprovement,"Ultimately it gets the job done but not with ease. The wire has to be placed just so or it will go right through the head or not in far enough. Compared to heads I have used in the past, these are not up to par. If you have patience and time to kill then go for it."
2,Not All That,"Contrary to the opinions of the previous reviewer, I found this book unhelpful in its analysis of the relationship between globalization and poverty. None of the editors has any economics credentials, which shows throughout in spotty analysis and the itch to leap to conclusions. The book glosses over the ways that free trade have helped lift much of SE Asia out of poverty, and instead indicts the ""sweatshops"" that have sprung up (as though these countries were thriving with economic opportunity before the fact). A subtle theme that is nonetheless evident in some of the articles is the pervasiveness of some sort of conspiracy by the rich and powerful: the World Bank, Transnationals, and Investors. The informed reader will find this approach in fact IS ""the usual liberal rant."" To be fair, these essays are at times descriptively informative, nonetheless the quasi-protectionist views that come out are ill-conceived and not borne out of any nuanced understanding of economics."
4,Caprine Cooking,I haven't had a chance to use this cookbook yet but I looked through many of the recipes and I can hardly wait to try them. Since this is an out of print book and there are so few cookbooks out there on cooking with goat products I am excited to be ablt to get this copy. I have purchased a few other cheesmaking books and this cookbook beats most of them because of its size and the breadth of recipes.
3,"WARNING: Not the Davies, Glover, Posford project that made ""Hicksville""","Last Call is a Celtic folk-pop album.Okay as those sorts of albums go, but probably not the sort of thing fans of the world/ambient/psychedelic/trance ""Hicksville"" would enjoy."
4,conventional recipes with flax added,"If you're looking for extremely healthy conscious recipes, this isn't the book you want. Most recipes are pretty standard fare, with, as one reviewer noted, ""1/4 cup ground flax added"". There is a LOT of info on flax health facts and general flax ""how to's"", including suggestions for how to incorporate flax into your favorite recipes.For those who are looking for recipes that the ""average"" American family will actually eat that have a little extra nutrition, this will probably work for you. Personally, I prefer the baked or raw recipes because I found that in sauces the flax adds a slight slimy texture. There are recipes for muffins and other breakfast items, smoothies, bread, power bars, appetizers, entrees and desserts. Ingredients are simple and easy to obtain, directions are easy to follow, nutrition facts are clearly documented. Recipes could be healthier, but the book is still useful."
1,recipes not worth it,"The 50 pages of text about flax at the beginning of the book is very informative. She provides a lot of research findings on the benefits of flax, the nutrients it provides, and buying/storing tips.The recipes, however, are HORRENDOUS. They call for unwholesome ingredients such as chocolate syrup, ice cream, cake mix, pancake syrup, Rice Krispies, white flour, white sugar, and canned fruit in syrup, just to name a few. I don't see how eating such a healthy supplement like flax can make you think you can consume such unwholesome junk like the ingredients she uses.There is a picture of her on the back cover, and you can see that she is overweight. So much for writing about health and diabetes cookbooks!"
5,Awesome recipes!,"My husband have been enjoying the recipes in this book, particularly the smoothies!! We feel so good after starting the day with a fresh fruit & flax smoothie! We're sending Mom one today. Enjoy!"
2,Not recommended for diabetics or insulin resistant,"Was HOPEFUL until I got to the smoothie recipes; they are full of added sugar. Looking closer I saw more refined grains - and all in all thought the recipes came across as using flax is an EXCUSE TO USE SUGAR AND REFINED FLOUR. I would like to challenge Elaine to re-write this and include more whole grains, less added sugars, and be more creative in her smoothie and power bar recipes - they don't all have to contain sorbet, ice milk, ice cream or frozen yogurt or candy to taste good and more protein would make them more balanced as a ""meal replacement"" as we tend to use them for in our fast paced lives. Maybe more is known today than in 2004 in this area and I hope she is ready to do an update!!"
2,Canning and Preserving Without Sugar Cookbook,"I was seriously disappointed when I got my cookbook and read the Recipe section. If you're looking for low sugar/ low carb recipes, this is not the cookbook for you.There is some good general canning info in the book, BUT while true to the title, Without Sugar, it is not suitable for diabetics or those on low/no carb diets. All the recipes are sweetened with either Honey or full sugar fruit juices. For a diabetic, honey and fruit juices are just as bad as Sugar. I drink fruit juice to bring up my sugars if I experience a serious drop in my blood sugar. Don't be confused. While it does have diabetic diet point system information, these recipes are not what a diabetic cook is looking for."
3,Not Really Without Sugar,"Although there's plenty of good information in this book, I was quite disappointed to find that the recipes are not ""without sugar"" - they simply substitute an alternative sugar such as fruit juice or a honey syrup. While both of those options are better than white sugar, for someone trying to reduce their sugar intake (especially because of diabetes or sugar sensitivity) they're only marginally helpful. It's also worth noting that using such substitutes could quickly become prohibitively expensive. I recommend checking your library for this before investing in your own copy to see how well it will actually fit your needs."
3,No Sugar Free persay...needed sugar alternatives,Was hoping for a book that had real sugar free options if this is what you are looking for than this book is not for you.
2,Have the recipes been tested for safety?,"While I like the idea of canning with sugar substitutes, I'm not thrilled with honey. Honey is still sugar, just in a different form. I was hoping for yummy recipes, but instead, I went back to doing what I used to do, and that is can the fruit with out anything, then add stevia right before dipping into the jar.Now, stevia is supposedly approved for canning now, but I have yet to see the recipes (I haven't looked very hard either).I am concerned about the safety of these recipes, as I don't see any information on whether or not the honey would change the pH, and if it is safe. I don't doubt the writer's taste experiments, but I did not read anything that stated that these recipes are safe."
5,Salt-Away on trailered salt water bay boat,I have found Salt-Away to be the single best product available for protecting my boat's stainless fittings and galvanized trailer from the ravages of salt water.
2,useful but dangerous,"This tool is very handy. I have always loved Vise-Grip tools, and when this came out I snapped it right up. There is a problem with the design of the knife blade, though. The tip of the knife blade is not fully recessed into the handle, so if you slip your finger between the two handles to ""feather"" the plier jaws open and closed, you can nick (slice open) your finger on the razor sharp tip. Vise-Grip claimed that they redesigned the tool and sent a replacement, but it was exactly the same."
1,John,"I have had this tool for awhile now intending to use it for electrical installations.I began using this tool lately and found that despite it's Vice-Grip pedigry, This tool is not only a completely unprofessional tool, it's a bit hazardous to use.I found specifically that:The locking pliers shake loose easily.The knife, wire stripper and screw driver do not lock in place making the use of them rather rickety.Using the v-notch wire stripper is a bit risky as it is on a sharp knife blade. If you place your thumb or finger on top of the wire you are stripping to apply a little preasure and hold the wire in place to cut the insulation as you must do to strip the wire, it is quite easy to cut yourself, as I did today.I'm a little more than disappointed that Vice-Grip would actually put this tool out. I have been using thier tools for years and have found their other tools to be quite excellent."
4,Great Peasant Dishes of the World,Book arrived quickly as just as described on Amazon by seller. So glad to have it.
1,Readings are 'way off' from the actual tension.,"Gamma String Tension TesterThe product I got had one of the worst caliberation I've ever seen.For eg: for the mains, it was showing 40 to 43 pounds when the actual string tension was 57 Lb. For the cross strings, it was showing 35-40 Lbs when the actual tension was 55 Lb. And the readings are not repeating.Note: I have tried it on different rackets.Also there is no setting changes for different string gauges, which I think should be there.I am going to return this one and I would recomment others not to buy this one."
5,Videonow light rocks!!!!,"The videonow light rocks.I bought a Videonow last week and it was awesome.I thought that something was missing and now I know what it is ,its the light.Now I can see my videonow in the dark I bought two days after I got my videonow.Then I went on the road with it at night and it works perfectly my mother didnt evenknow that I was in the car.I love my video now light !!!!!!!!!!"
2,This book is a disappointment,"Considering this book is by a musician and professor of music, it contains surprisingly few insights into what was unique about Cole Porter's lyrics and music, and does little to set his work within a musical context. From time to time the author embarks on embarrassing little journeys into pop psychology of the 'Was Porter's homosexuality an attempt to find a significant father figure in his life? We may never know.' variety. The quality of the writing is disappointing. At one point Schwartz describes a meeting between Cole Porter and Louis Mayer, the movie mogul. Schwartz describes Mayer as 'literally oozing with charm', or some such. Unfortunately, this is typical of the standard of writing throughout the book."
2,Falls short on sounds and loops,"A nice kit for the basics, but the lack of a set of clave samples is a huge oversight. Also missing is a far more comprehensive set of loops. Example: there's no mambo."
3,Only so-so,"The samples are great quality and really extensive. But the midi are far too limited to be useful. I was hoping for Carlos Santana-level percussion, and ended up with a beatnick bongo beat. Bring on more midi!"
4,beautifully wrought insights,"Control freaks and hard case disciplinarians will hate this book, as will anyone who equates ""navel-gazer"" with ""ne'er-do-well"". My wife and I both loved the 'The Water in Between', however. It's funny and embarrassingly honest. The author does nothing to make himself more than what he is. In keeping his ocean passages as slow as possible (he's already encrusted with barnacles at the START of a long crossing), he achieves weeks at a time of Zen states that the rest of us can only dream of. He turns the myth and mysticism of wanderlust inside out and explores that terrain with subtlety and nuance most writers only hint at, yielding beautifully wrought insights one after another, page after page. What he does personally with these insights is not nearly as important as just writing about them so deeply. You're free in the end to choose your own path as he heads home."
3,Melancholy as deep as the Pacific,"Not a travelogue as much as a fleshing out of the regrets of a man on the ocean. He admits to the self-pity early, and it is as consistent as the tides. Only about half the time is spent discussing the travels, but when they are, they are excellent (Perryhn and Palmyra). The verbal journey in-between can be long, but the hope for more of it kept me interested enough to finish."
4,Northern Exposure at sea,"If you were a Northern Exposure fan, you'll recognize Joel, now at sea. Patterson gives voice to the experience of being mundane: pathetic self absorption intermittantly mixed with honest self awareness. Horse latitudes and gales. A book worth living with for a while."
2,What a Bore!,"What a self-indulgent book: 1. Tedious quotations from dozens of other travel authors 2. tedious paragraphs about his supplies 3. cliched insights into ""the human psyche"" 4. The author is the least sympathetic ""character"" in his book but we have to hear his thoughts for 300 pages. Why did his girlfriends or his sailing partner put up with him? This book received many good reviews but I think all those ""professional"" critics were taken with the idea of the story ""Melancholy Doctor Has Heart Broken And Goes To Sea But Doesn't Know How To Sail!"" not the book itself."
1,Boring whiner drifts in Pacific,"Goodness, I had such high hopes for this book. Turned out to be 15% sailing, 15% travelogue, 30% quotations from other travelogues, and 40% whining about the bad things that had happened in the course of the author's last 5-7 years. Great cover, excellent marketing, lousy book."
1,Don't bother,"The nautica was OK, but the ""naughty""-ca was not! This man is an openly unrepentant fornicator, adulterer, and blasphemer. I got so tired of his morose existential navel-gazes that after the first four chapters, I just couldn't continue. Yes, I pity him and do most sincerely hope that he someday finds the Answer."
5,An emotional as well as an physical journey,Most books about ocean voyages are as dull as a day in the doldrums. This one is not. The author tells more truths and fewer lies than any other author of this genre but the real interest in the book is not simply the physical journey to Tahiti and back but the emotional journey from the person who left to the considerably wiser person who returned.
2,Feckless Voyage of Self Discovery,"Christopher Buckley likens this book to Theroux's ""Happy Isles of Oceania,"" but I do not agree. Patterson, totally inexperienced, buys a ferro-cement sailboat in British Columbia, adds two slight acquaintances, successfully sails to the South Pacific islands and then, alone, eventually returns (barely) to Seattle. However, this is less an account of a sailing venture than a personal self analysis of a not very interesting person who fumbles through the months as amateur sailor and beachcomber with little edifying result. Patterson is also given to including long, page-length quotes from several well-known sailing voyage authors that I have already read in the original, and I did not appreciate Patterson padding his less effective prose with those excerpts."
5,the best PBS series ever,"My children (age 6, 3, and 18 months) would watch George all day if I let them! All of them find it entertaining, even myself! Love the characters, stories, and science/math lessons in them."
4,"smokey,sultry,but a little draggy","First, I want to say that K D Lang has an absolute gorgeous voice,sultry,and her style is jazzy and cool, but some of the songs were a little slow. The valley of the dolls theme was why i purchased this and it didnt dissapoint, Smoke Rings was great,with an Hawaiian feel. I think the theme was interesting too. She is so underrated."
5,Not to be played before dark,"This disc needs dark surroundings, and preferably a smoky atmosphere. All the songs are downtempo, often sombre. Thematically they are linked by references to smoking (hence the title, which does not refer to kd's dress in the cover shot) but they are not necessarily about smoking. Still, this is one of the more consistent, and consistently good, efforts kd lang has released.Heartily recommended for the midnight hour."
5,Drag,I'm so glad to have this K.D.Lang CD. She is one of my favorites and this is one of her best and thanks for Amazon and the very fast delivery. Mary
4,Drag may not be what you think,I have been a huge fan of K D Lang's for a long time now and this CD proved to be as interesting as I had hope for. When I first heard it I just laughed disbelieving my situation since I quit smoking after smoking most of my life...........and had the usual demons to deal with when you have an addiction.........but DRAG turned out to be a CD mainly concerned with smoking!!!! I laughed so hard the first time I listened to it but after that when I would get a craving I put this on and had a smoke mentally......it has kept me off the cigarettes and proved to me yet again that K. D. never ceases to amaze me and has kept me constantly entertained over the years not only with that incredible voice but the sense of humor that is ever present...........way to go!
5,k.d. lang is a goddess,"k.d.lang has a voice that just soars and is able to wrap itself around a song. I would call her a modern day Karen Carpenter. The depth of emotion in her singing and the songs on this album just show off that range. The theme of ""drag"" is carried throughout the album in the smokey sound of her voice and the literally smokey/airy titles of the songs. ""The Air That I Breathe"" is a perfect example of the floating vocals making a perfectly perfect ethereal atmosphere.This is an amazing album of songs sung by an amazing voice of our time. Haunting and moving. A definite must for any music lover and an absolute must for a k.d. fan."
5,POSSIBLY THE BEST FROM KD,"This CD is just amazing, although the first time I heard it I was not a fan. I now think that it is a classic. My last cigarette (track 4) just sends shivers up my spine. KD'S voice surely cannot get any better than it is on this album."
3,k d lang..it DRAGs a bit..,"k d lang has a stunning voice. Its range is maleable, its emotions haunting. What makes this CD not a 5 star endeavor is the production. Too languid and almost too sultry, it sort of takes over lang's voice and makes the whole affair a sort of mish mash of lounge music. Her take on ""The Joker"" and ""The Air That I Breathe"" stand out as exceptions...and her version of ""Valley Of The Dolls"" has the correct air of detachment.lang has a tendency to sing too slowly, and she seems to prefer arrangements that are so slow, you could drive a train through the pauses. She suffers from this same problem in some other CDs, most notably in sections of Ingenue and Invincible Summer(a far superior CD by the way).I love lang's voice, but overall, this CD's title sort of says it all, and it has nothing to do with cross-dressing or puffing on a cigarette."
2,Kind Of A Drag,"Oh joy, a whole concept album centered around cigarettes. It even manages to slander the Hollies' classic ""The Air That I Breathe"" (which has NOTHING to do with smoking; lang must have erroneously thought that including it would be wryly clever). lang's version of the song literally drags...and drags...and has none of the intensity and life that the Hollies' version had. And Steve Miller's ""Joker""? Give me a break. That song was an inane 3-chord dud even in Miller's original version. Trying to do a smooth, slow, contemporary-adult version of it just makes matters even worse."
4,Nearly a 5-star...,"Having first seen k.d. lang perform many of these songs in an acoustic setting, with simply her, her voice, and a piano, I was disappointed with the arrangements on this album. Her voice is never at fault, but what suffers are the songs that are much more poignant without the dreamy overtures in the background. I loved the theme that persisted throughout the album, but after having seen her perform on Sessions at West 54th, I can't help but wish for more from this album."
1,"Non-technical broad brush, lacks depth","This book is aimed at non-technical readers who want a broad brush of the field with little depth. The focus is on what agents can (or might) do, and what the potential business applications might be. The level of coverage on how agents work and on emerging standards is adequate for aquainting newcomers with the buzz words, but not for conveying any real understanding. There are no discussions of agent design principles or detailed case studies. I had hoped to learn something from this book and came away disappointed. It is not worth the price."
5,Amazing,"What an Amazing book! Get it at once ... You will find yourself reading the book from cover to cover and more importantly, will use it as a reference manual, to dip into from time to time for advice. Business opportunities abound on very page. This is the most outstanding book on agents so far."
5,Well written - Good value - recommended,"I am impressed with the quality, breadth, scope and recommend it for anyone interested in agent technology. It is clear, and to the point. There is no hype, ancedotes -just practical advice.I liked Arthur C Clarkes introduction."
5,Highly readable - Plain english,"If you're looking for a technical code to solve agent problems, then this is not the book for you. If you want a comprehensive analysis of the possible effects of agent technology then this is a must read. The authors have done a great job and have made a through analysis of possible agent areas and how industry and society will be affected. As a professional agent programmer, I was aware of most of the applications discussed , but was still surprised by some areas covered that I had never considered. I do not agree with the negative reviews listed here and recommend readers make up their own minds.In conclusion - highly readable and recommended."
3,be ready,"my daughter loves this dirtbike and in the beginning evrything was fine. I purchased the extended warranty(suggested), and the toy r us extended warranty department stated that manuf. warranty was 1 year, and razor stated 90 days. after a week got that settled. bike has required several replacement parts. the first arrived fine. the second, i told the lady(at razor) it was the wrong part she insisted it was not. it arrived and it was the WRONG part! Now trying to contact them and am unable to get through to razor customer service(sales answers right away). buy if u want but don't say i didn't warn you."
2,Way too small!,"This dirt bike is ""designed for ages 12 and up,"" but when my eight year old got on he looked like he should be a clown in the circus. The bike is tiny. I would recommend it for 5 or 6 year-olds, but no older. We had two other Razor electric dirt bikes, MX650 and MX500, and either of those would be perfect for an eight year old. In fact, after being disappointed by the size of this bike, we went ahead and ordered another MX500 (which, by the way, is an excellent product)."
2,not for 8 year olds,While this bike is fine for a child that is 5 or 6 it is definetly not for any 8 year old that is active or that you consider good at sports. It is much too small and much too slow. I purchased this for my 8 year old grandson but to watch him ride it was silly. My 6 year old granddaughter now has it and she is small for her age. It works great for her....
4,Great little starter dirt bike,"My 5 yeard old son received this for christmas this year so we haven't had it long. This is a great little starter dirt bike. He has been riding bicycles with out training wheels for the past year 1/2 so he had no problems balancing this dirt bike at all. It is the perfect size and goes fast, yet not so fast that I am worried about him taking a little crash. I agree with some of the other reviews that the shocks are not very good, so when he rides on the grass it is pretty bumpy. This does not seem to bother him too much though. Only other draw back is that the razor stickers which are applied to give it the dirt bike look are already peeling off. It has not been exposed to weather/rain at all, is kept on our back porch when not being rode. Hopefully a little super glue can fix this problem. Over all pleased with this dirt bike."
4,Razor Sharp!,I bought this little dirtbike for my son a few years back. He was 6 years old at the time and had been riding a bicycle for almost 2 years so I figured the next logical step was something like this. With a little instruction he got on it and took right off like he'd been doing it forever.I will say this - it says on the box for kids 12+ and I think thats bad advertisement... my son enjoyed it for about a year and then I had to upgrade him to a gas powered bike so he could ride on a little rougher terrain and go up hills. He can still ride the razor but its better suited for flat paved surfaces. A 12 year old would have fun on this thing for about 1 hour - its just not powerful enough to lug them around.That being said our bike was reliable and has lasted through two kids learning. Its awesome for beginners and thats really all it should be bought for. Make sure to buy helmets and pads too - I see too many kids on these things with no protection. Teach them young.
2,Razor MX350 Dirt Rocket Electric Motorcross Bike for little tikes,"We are VERY disappointed the age requirements for the bike. I called Razor directly and they were emphatic about it being the right size and reponsibility for a 12+ year old. Well, our son just turned 10 and is on the average to small size. He BARELY fits on the bike, it is SOOOOOO small. His 12 year old brother, who is not much bigger that he is, could not ride at all! So we have spent all this $ and will get a few rides out of it, at best. A COMPLETE MISREPRESENTATION! And most importantly, a very disappointed child...Don't buy it for anyone over 8 years old!"
3,"Fun Bike, Weak Motor","I bought an MX500 for my 9 year old son, and I bought this bike for my 7 year old. While the MX500 was strong enough to take my older son up the grassy hills of my lawn, the MX350 was too weak to take even my 7 year old son up those same hills.He still loves the bike and loves to ride it up and down the driveway and down to the cul de sac, but I felt I should have gotten the bigger bike even for my smaller son.The battery has not given us any problems even after a year."
1,Dead on arrival,"got it yesterday, charged all night. my son was so anxious. got on today, it runs for 10 seconds, then dies. wait 1 minute, it would start again. but dies again 10 seconds later.Razor really need to get their quality control in place.the way they package the bike is almost impossible to stuff it back for return."
1,"horrible, horrible, horrible!!! need i say more? dont buy this!",i just recieved this bike (the second time i ordered it) because i returned the first one because it was defective. BATTERY WILL NOT CHARGE! i now need to return this one for the same reason. does the RAZOR company make any bikes that WORK?? very poor quality control! and the worst part is my child who was dissapointed TWICE!!!!!!!!
1,Didn't work!!!,"What a disapointment!! I got this for my for Christmas, followed all the instructions, to put together, charged it like the manual said, when my son got ready to ride it, it barely moved, it was beyond sluggish, my son is only 50lbs, Boy was he upset!!! I don'nt know maybe we got a lemon!!!!"
1,worst money i ever spent,when i bought this motor bike i thought it was o.k.but suddenlythe battery started to drop suddenly.later i found out that the rever onthe electric bike had broken off.this electric motorbike bike was the worst money i ever spent .
2,Did not get what was described!,The description said it has Full Suspension. It has No Suspension!It works pretty good but the ride is very stiff with NO Suspension whatsoever. The frame is completely rigid. No shocks in the front or swingarm in thw back! False Advertising! Amazon should be more aware of what they are selling. This makes me not want to buy products online.
2,"Small, underpowered, ok for 6-7 yr old","We got this for our 10yr old after doing research on it on the Razor web site. It is recommended for a 12+ year old and we based our decision on that. Bottom line is it has 'ok' power if it is your childs very first electric vehicle. Any child with electric vehicle experience will love the looks and always be looking for power. For a child over 8-9 and 50-60lbs this will disappoint. It is VERY small, 12inch tires, and no suspension. Our son is average height/weight and he overwhelms the bike.Looks great but NOT worth the $."
5,For the little crusty demons,"We bought this for our 6yr old and cannot begin to say how perfect this toy has been. Several of the girls on our street have the pink scooters (same motor) and they have taken a serious beating. We hoped the same would hold true for the Dirt Rocket.After a week of daily use, I cannot complain about a thing. The charge in the battery lasts about an hour (my son is very small for his age, lightweight) and to this point there have been no problems with the plastic breaking or cracking. The bike has been kept on the road and hard packed dirt and grass, but also has been crashed several times (14mph into trees and curbs). It was rode through some water, but for the most part, we are making sure we keep it very dry.My 12yr old rode it (90lbs) and was WAY too big for it. The bike was clearly laboring with him; I wouldn't recommend anyone over 70lbs. I've seen some negative reviews regarding features, but for a quarter of the price of a gas powered 50cc, this is great value."
2,NOT WHAT I EXSPECTED,"I BROUGHT THIS BIKE FOR MY NINE YEAR OLD AND DID NOT KNOW IT WAS A MINATURE BIKE, I LIKE THE BIKE BUT MY SON WAS JUST TO BIG FOR IT, I RETURNED IT AND GOT THE MX500 WHICH WAS BIGGER AND FIT MY NINE YEAR OLD PERFECTLY, I RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE TO READ ALL SMALL PRINTS WHEN PURCHASING ANYTHING FROM AMAZON, MY NEIGHBOR BROUGHT THE SAME BIKE FOR HER NINE YEAR OLD SHE WENT TO MAKE A RETURN THEY TOLD HER THEY WAS SENDING HER THE SAME BIKE BUT IT WAS NOT A MINATURE BIKE, BUT WHEN SHE RECEIVED THE BIKE IT WAS THE SAME MINATURE BIKE THAT SHE HAD PURCHASE IN THE BEGINNING! BE CAREFUL FOLKS"
4,A few negatives,"Overall, I don't regret buying this bike. We have had this for only 2 months and we have had some issues with the battery not charging and also it is always on even when you turn it off which could be dangerous. My son loves it, he just turned 7 and is a very big boy (over 70 pounds and about 4'9""). The bike is big enough and fast enough without being too much of either. One of the neighborhood kids had his for 2 weeks and it just wouldn't take a charge any more. My older daughter has the moped. We have had no problems with that battery or power switch. The dirtbike does go a little fast and is much better in the grass/dirt though.I say buy it but be prepared for some issues."
5,Great dirt bike,I actually returned this dirt bike because it was not large enough for my 8 year old son. I then ordered the next size up which is fantastic. He loves it. I would recommend this dirt bike for a child who is 5 to 7 years old.
5,Best father's day gift ever!,I purchased this bike for my 6 year old daughter! Excellent! The battery last 30 min tops but it is a great way to get used to riding a bike at a young age. My 2 year old will be next in line. Aloha!
5,Razor,"The Razor MX350 Dirt Bike was exactly what we hoped it would be for our twin 6-yr. old boys. Our boys weigh 50 ibs. each, and this bike is the perfect size and speed for their safety! We will order with Amazon again."
5,Perfect gift for my son,This gift won't stop giving. Durable to stand up to any kid. Comes ready to ride after a simple assembly that took less than 5 minutes. I think this will be around for a long time. My son never gets tired of riding it. Great gift.
4,Razor MX350 Dirt Bike Review,"So far so good. No issues with electric dirt bike (only had it a week though). My 10 yr old boy loves it, and so does his 10 & 15 yr old brothers. Will keep you guys updated. The suspension has not been that big of an issue. BTW as the dad I had to test it out first, and I'm 6'2"" and 250lbs, and I rode it fine on their basketball court. Ha Ha."
5,not happy with delivery,"I had to sign for a $20 wig, and I find it very dis-satisfying that my $200 bike was just dropped off in front of my garage door. I work for Amazon and would think that this amount of money for something would require a signature. I do not have the money to just get a new one. This is really poor business."
3,"So far, so good!",I purchased this item for my 8 year old son for Christmas. He has been pleased with the ride and is having a great time. My only request is to supply a larger battery pack or offer a second battery that could be ready at all times. The 30 minute use for a 12-hour charge is crazy in this age of technology. Really makes the bike overpriced. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we don't have any of the battery issues that others have referred to. For now my 8 year old and his twin sister are enjoying the ride!
1,save your money,"Just to let you know I have never owned or ridden this dirt bike, but it's electric and looks cheap. If you are looking for something that goes fast I don't recommend this. Get a real dirt bike like a Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki, or a KTM. Don't waste your money on this. and if your a beginner get a four stroke trail bike. I'll give examples of what bikes I think are good for that age.(Note I'm only going to suggest Honda's because I think they are the most beginner friendly. Most other bikes are for motocross.)5-7=Honda CRF50F,7-8/9=Honda CRF80F9-13Honda CRF100F(I started out on it and loved it!)13-15=Honda CRF150FI don't want to tell you what bike to get so I'd suggest you go to a dealer and sit on the bikes and if your over 16 test them. And even though a Honda costs more it's well worth it."
2,not good toy,i dont think this is a very good toy unless u want to go only ten miles per charge which u have to wait for it to charge but if it runs on gas u can go farther and fill it up wen ever but gas only slows u down wen u run out of gas and oil
3,Good Bike but Take Care of Your Tires,"I bought this bike for my 14 year old. He very much enjoys riding it. (He's a small 14-year old.) The only concern we have is with the tires. After a few times riding it, the tire went flat. We have already replaced 2 inner tubes. Not sure if the inner tube was old, inflated to much or the rubber is just not thick enough. He really isn't driving it anywhere that might cause a puncture, so we can't figure out why this continues to happen. That's why I would give this bike only 3 stars."
4,Grandson says it's awesome,We purchased the razor in June and our 6yr.old grandson loves it. The only issue I have with it is the tires don't hold up and to find replacement tires is impossible in stores I had to go on the internet. He wasn't to happy that he couldn't ride it over the weekend. Today the new tires came in the mail so i called him andhe was happy.
4,FAST,"My son loves it, but it's a bit of an adjustment from anything he's had. It goes up to 14 mph, and at his age (5) he just needs more time to be comfortable with it. Once he gets used to the feel it will be better, but this sure was exciting to have under the tree Christmas morning!"
4,Great unitl battery dies,This is a great product for younger children. My son is five and works great for him. He rides for about 40 mins. the charge time is up to 12 hours which isnt great. You can ride the bike once a day then have to charge.
1,terrible,I bought this for my 7 year old and it rode for a couple times and after that it stopped working. I charged it for two days and it drove as fast as a infant can crawl and I am not able to return this product.
2,A lot of issues.,"Battery issues, issues with the brake and engine cut off.While my son loves this bike when it works, which is pretty rare. We also own the Razor quad, and have had relatively no issues with it."
2,Didn't last long.,"Tires wore out after minimal use. Checked into replacing tires, but found that this would cost almost as much or equal to price of bike."
4,User Friendly MotoBike,"Bought this for my 10 year old son as he was ready for nicer ride, ashis ""mechanical abilities"" are not quite ready for a gas powered bikeand their ""higher maintenace requirements""The Razor MX350 is easy to assemble & is made of decent components.ITS QUITE!!!....so the neighbors won't even know about the happy lad cruising the scene @ 15m.p.h..It's electric powered therefore ""green"" so the neighbor in the Prius will even approve.It's been very reliable & the batteries are holding up if charged properly as its best to run the batteries down all the way before charging & give it a COMPLETE CHARGE(8 to 10 hrs) instead of short sporadic charges as short charges shortens battery lifeThis electric power motobike has replaced gaming systems as my sons favorite toy!!!& I sure wish they had toys like this when I was young"
5,great buy,we purchased this bike for our grandson and he absolutely ador's it. rides it every day. we also purchased all the safety gear to go with it. seems like he enjoys this more then anything we've ever purchased for him...... highly recommend this bike if you re in the market for a first time beginner's motorcycyle
4,RAZOR MX 350 TIRE WEAR.,"I'M HAVING EXCESSIVE TIRE WEAR ON THE BACK TIRE....THE FIRST TIRE LASTED 4 - 5 MONTHS, BUT THE REPLACEMENT TIRE ONLY LAST 3 - 4 WEEKS...ANYONE KNOW A BETTER REPLACEMENT TIRE FOR THE MX350...I WENT FOR PRICE ON THE REPLACEMENT TIRE....12.99..BUT WOULD LIKE A BETTER TIRE.....THANKS TOMMY7519"
5,So much fun!,"I had a YZ50 when I was younger and when my son turned 5 I wanted to get him one too.. The problem is my HOA would not like to hear a gas bike out in te greenbelt park behind our house, so opted to take a chance on this. This bike is soo much fun, we've had it about a year and a half and its still working great. Its about time to replace the batteris but that is expected since we've charged this thing so many times. I think the weigh limit is 150lb, but I could not help to try an ride it..I weigh 250lb :) Well it held up and actully moved at about 10mph with me on it.. Funny, anyways my son still loves it at 6 yrs and I plan on getting another when my other son turned 5 at the end of this year( I make it a goal that they learn to ride w/o training wheels by the time they turn 5, to get one), so far so good. Buy it!! Would also reccomend the Razor helmet as its lightweight and perfect for kids with these"
3,Too Small For Advertised Age!,"It was ordered for a 4 foot, 10 inch, 10 year old and there is no possible way he could ride this comfortably for any length of time. Yes, I have seen videos of grown men riding around pocket rockets looking like idiots, but that's not exactly the ideal. Don't believe the packaging, I'm sure that is just for liability purposes.Bottom line, if you want to buy one of these for your child and they are older than 8 or 9 and of average stature, you will want to move up to the MX500. I am returning the ,MX350 in favor of the 500; let's just hope it gets here in time for Christmas."
4,Great little first dirt bike!,My 5yr old son who has been riding w/out training wheels since age 3 hopped on this bike and just took off! It goes just fast enough for him to love it and me to be nervous. It is powerful enough to get around good in grass and the battery lasts for a good hour or more of riding it. I would not buy it for a kid older than 10 though. It was a great transition from Power Wheels though!
5,Great starter bike for a 5 year old!,awesome bike. lasts longer on the battery than i thought. 5 year old boy got bored of it quick though and wanted a gas bike to go faster so now he moved on to a yamaha ttr 50.
1,not so great,"Purchases the Razor MX350 for a 5 year old to learn to ride before going for the real thing. It is very slow to start and takes a while to gain speed, also its all or nothing...you can't regulate the speed, I was not impressed. Also, it is pretty much powerless riding on grass unless it is cut very short and completely dry and no shocks at all. Be sure if you are purchasing this it is ONLY for neighborhood street riding....not dirt or grass."
5,Razor electric 350 mini bike,"My son loves this bike but the only complaint I have is that we can't find a back tire for it. My son got a flat tire two weeks after he received the bike. He received it in May and now he can't ride it because of the flat tire (it is now June 26th), we have looked everywhere for this tire but nobody seems to have one, not even the Razor web site."
4,Wow. Wish I had one of these when I was a kid.,"This electric motorcycle is awesome. It really goes, especially with lighter riders.I don't have much to add about it, except that it is REALLY QUIET.That is great for keeping the neighborhood quiet.But it is also a bit dangerous, since kids aren't always aware of cars, and vice versa.So if you get one of these cycles, consider putting a flag on it for extra visibility.At the very least, make sure your kids are well supervised when riding... and wear a helmet."
2,"nice bike, but too small","This was my 12 yr old son's Christmas gift, and I got this size because it is recommended for 12 and up. It is practically all assembled and in very good condition. However, the seat is only 20"" off the ground. My son would not even be able to turn a corner without hitting his knees. He reminded me of the character on Laugh-In who was too big for his trike! We hope to be able to exchange it for a larger size, the MX500 or MX650, but we are going to see it first."
2,As long as it works..It's fine,"I have to admit, We loved this bike. It's quiet. It's fast (enough) for its size and it's a blast to ride. My Son loved it. But god forbid if anything other than the 5 or 6 parts listed on the Razor retail website break. I've been activiely fighting with these people for 9 months to get a part. Short of buying a new bike and canabalizing it for parts, these folks are VERY, VERY HARD to do business with. All of the ""Authorized"" service centers inthe Philly region have stopped doing business with Razor due to a lack of support. Buy the bike, it's fun, but it's a throw-away. at $300+ that shouldn't be the case."
2,Broke within the first few months - save your money!!,"Our 8 yr. old son saved up for this item for over 7 months. When he had accumulated enough money from birthdays, holidays, etc. we helped him out and placed the order. He rode the dirt bike maybe 20 times. The battery never held a charge for long, then it just stopped charging all together. We purchased a brand new battery and the dirt bike still does not work after installing the new battery! We are very disappointed with this purchase and would not recommend any Razor products since this is the second Razor item we have bought that is not a quality product. My son did enjoy riding it very much for the short amount of time that it worked. Imagine an 8 yr old saving up for that long only to be disappointed in the end! Save your money or buy a different brand."
5,The best bike in the world!!!!!,I got this bike as a Christmas present from my awesome Dad. It looks really cool and goes pretty fast. I am 8 years old and fit on it good. We built a ramp in the pasture and I like to jump it. I wish the battery lasted longer.
5,This DVD PROVIDES THE MISSING LINK TO WEIGHT LOSS!,"I highly recommend this DVD to complement any weight management/weight loss program. It offers the missing link of motivating your mind, body, spirit to eat healthy and mindfully. I am a registered dietician for a hospital and the participants in our weight management plan love it! If you are overweight, the exercises in this DVD are modified so that anyone can do them. The breathing is also explained exceptionally well and really helps get rid of stress."
2,Not as expected,"I was expecting this DVD to challenge me with yoga postures and a relaxation/meditation geared to weight loss. Each posture is held for only a very short time and many are modified in such a way that I felt no challenge at all (and I am fairly new to yoga).Strangely, the routine is broken up with blank screens between every posture which tell the benefits of each posture. This feature would have been better placed on an extra track for one-time review. It left you standing there for an extended period waiting for the next posture. And there was only one new posture that I had not seen in other yoga DVDs.The ""weight-loss meditation"" at the end was only 5 minutes long and not much different from the relaxation poses at the end of other routines.On the positive side, the breathwork is explained well enough that I have recommended this routine to my mother, but I probably won't be using it again."
2,Not what I expected!,"This was my first Yoga DVD purchase. Being a beginner, the stretching exercises are great but the quality of the product and the too sappy, sweetness of the instructor, I had a hard time getting into a routine. It was hard to focus."
3,Indian Folklore,"With simplicity and wit, Rockwell tells the story of a vain little monkey who steals a pearl necklace from a princess. How the mischievous thief is caught and the necklace recovered is an unusual and amusing story."
4,Straight heat---no fillers,"I applaud the long-overdue commercial success of Hip Hop and I'll defend it to my death. But it's frustrating to me that really good music like this CD has will not reach the masses via radio and video outlets like the ridiculously horrible projects from Jadakiss, Eastsidaz, or Fabolous. From end to end, this is how lyrics are supposed to be kicked. I don't know when the tide will shift, if ever. But I'm glad that I have the CD and I applaud Sway and King Tech for not keeping it ""gutter"" or ""gangsta"", but keeping it Hip Hop."
5,SATISFIED :),"GOT THIS C.D FOR MY B.F EVERY TIME WE SEEN IT, IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE BUT HERE WE FOUND IT FOR A GREAT PRICE AN SHIPPING WAS FAST"
2,Spotting,"After I started using this product, all of my whites starting haveing a blueish tint to it and some spotting that looked like grease stains. My clothes smell wonderful, but I can't handle the spotting! Would not recommend."
4,"Low Price, Works Great","Yes they seem flimsy, but due to the way they scissor together, they don't need to be solid steel. These are sold in Museum Replicas catalogs for $12 plus shipping, so I figure I got a steal.Mine work great, dont' take away from the swords I put in them, and I paid very little for them. Sounds like a win."
3,Great product for the price paid.,"I can't say that there is anything super special about these hooks, but they defiently do the job that they are intneded to do and unless you look close you can't tell they're there. They also do indeed expand or contract depending on what you want to display... we have a full sized cutlass on a matching dagger on another. All in all its not pretty like some of the ones that I've seen, but it defienlty does the job"
4,Simple and Easy,perfect fit for my swords. easy to install. can't see them after you hang the swords on the wall. perfect.
3,"Minor adjustments, but good","Simple working design, holds the sword very well. With only one screw, its mostly self-leveling. It is all but invisible behind the sword after mounted. May want to bend the prongs a little bit to make sure it doesn't dig into the blade and scuff the polish."
2,Not so universal,"Though inexpensive and cleverly designed, this hanger does not deserve the name ""universal."" I bought it to hang a sword that has protuberances at the end of the hilt (the butt?) that stand out 90 degrees from the plane of the blade. These protuberances caused the sword not to hang flat to the wall and, worse, kept the holder from locking properly. I ended up using an eye screw and wire instead of a special hanger.Truth in advertising would require a note that this hanger will work only with FLAT swords."
2,sword hangers,"they came quickly but they seem like very flimsy and not really strong hangers. Seemed very cheap, was afraid they wouldn't hold sword."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I bought this to hang a sword my son won at a grappling tournament. It must be made for very thin swords. They should take the word ""universal"" out of its description and name. Simply put: it did not work for me."
2,cheap and flimsy,Product is cheap and flimsy and I wonder if the sword will stay on in even a minor earthquake. Shipping costs are way more than it should be for an item this small and light.
1,Not worth it - Doesn't work,"This is a ZERO STAR item. Do NOT buy it for any reasonPaid $4.41 plus $2.50 shipping, for a total invoice of $6.91I trusted the vendor (Sword Demon) description and claims. Should have trusted all the reviewsHad to return since it is cheap and not functional (may hold a letter opener, but not a sword of any type)When I returned it, I had to pay to ship it back, and they gave me back $3.53! So I am out almost $10 and they give me back $3.53.Complete sham!I am highly disappointed in Sword Demo for 'selling' these poorly made, non-functioning product."
5,Good supplemental book,I got this book to help me with college Calc 1 & 2 classes that did not require a book. This book contains good explanations of the basic areas of Calc 1 & 2 along with practice problems. It was a great help and didn't break the bank.
1,"For those who like to watch, not do.","I was quite excited about receiving this tutorial based on the previous reviews. ""Finally,"" I thought to myself, ""I've found a solution for surmounting Authorware's steep learning curve."" You can imagine my overwhelming disappointment when I discovered that this entire package is nothing more than a video walk-through WITHOUT practice files. Let me repeat that: There are NO practice files included with this tutorial.Without the ability to practice what one is observing, this tutorial has very little value. No one can learn how to use any software package, let alone an application like Authorware, by simply watching someone else use it--no matter how well-stated the explanations are.Don't waste your money on this tutorial and don't even consider buying it until a future update is released with practice files."
5,Great AVR reference album and solid best-of for Fourplay,"If you like Fourplay but do not have interest in collecting their older albums - this is a solid single-disc collection. I'm not a huge Fourplay fan, but really enjoy some of their work - and this hits the spot for me.This is also a useful collection for testing and tuning reference-grade stereo and AVR equipment. Most of the songs on this album are well-recorded and clearly mastered, and the songs themselves have a nice frequency range especially with the sub-100hz string bass sections on several of the songs."
4,Best of Fourplay,"Loved it! I heard a couple of cuts at a friends house. I am so glad I bought it. Easy listening, with a good beat."
5,Smooth relaxing jazz!,"Fourplay has a very relaxing sound,a group that looks & sounds like they have played together a long time & are having fun doing it! with much versatility "" great sound """
5,Eddie Bravo is a Genius!,"This DVD is amazing! I highly suggest it to anyone looking to improve their ground game, beyond what traditional BJJ teaches."
5,Mastering the rubber guard DVD,"The mastering the rubber guard Eddie bravo DVD came very fast and came in perfect condition. I bought it for his Christmas gift and was nervous that he wouldn't get it on time, but it did and he was so happy when he opened his present."
2,Great instruction poor presentation,"The instruction, in a vacuum, is an A+. But there is profanity/drug use/offensive position names (i.e. Retard Control)/etc.If you think that sort of thing is cool, then this video warrants 5 stars. If you don't then it's a mixed bag. I'd like to use it to work out with my son, but the negatives (morally dubious role model) grossly outweigh the positives (better jiu jitsu). It's a shame, the instruction is top notch."
3,Most likely they will not fit,"These are very short. Since they didn't provide any measurements on the item's listing, I didn't realize they wouldn't fit until I tried them out. The bolts I used for my toilet were shorter than most but still not short enough to work with these."
5,Caps,"These are just like they say, they are caps. I give them a 5 stars due to the quality and feel of them. With that said, I can't use them, by anchor bolts are too long. So if you want a deep set of caps, pass on these, otherwise, these are great."
3,very tiny,"This is the tiniest spatula I've ever seen. It looks like for a tea party toy or something, but I guess it will work for certain items, so I did not return it. I just didn't realize how small the dimensions were=my own fault. I will see how much I use it in the coming months."
5,Great for bar cookies,"I love the size of this spatula! It is prefect for getting our bar cookies or brownies. We used to have a pampered chef one that was very similar, but it broke, so we needed a replacement. Would definitely buy again."
4,Built better,"This product is built better than the one from Pampered Chef. The feel is not quite as good, but it will last way longer."
5,Matches if not better to the pampered chef version,"Having a mini spatula is so convenient for cookies, brownies, pie, etc. I use to own the pampered chef and loved it but somehow I lost the spatula. I didn't want to spend the money on a pampered chef version so I got this item and it compares wonderfully! I also got a silicone mini spatula thinking this would be just as good - wrong! The spatula was not sturdy enough. This one is so much better with a nice strong wooden handle and stainless steel. Highly recommended, a must for the kitchen!"
4,A solid example of the musical poetry of the '60s - a collectors must!,"At long last we have an opportunity to have this musical collection. Noonan, Copeland, and Browne combining their early talents to provide a very enjoyable listening experience, reflecting the true musical poetry which was the hallmark of the '60s. The music is timeless....................ENJOY!"
2,My least favorite Tasty Bite Indian ready meal,"This is my least favorite Tasty Bite Indian ready meal. It is bland and uninspired. It is eatable, but with all the finer choices available, I suspect my remaining packets will find their way to a charity food drive."
4,Old Glory!!!,"This nifty little book covers the history of our Nation's flag and the various rules governing its care and display. One glaring error on page 32 states that Memorial Day arose from Armistice Day. Other than that, it is a fine book for those who love the flag."
3,Ok Poker table cover,I made a custom poker table an wanted a nice cover to protect it. I came across this poker table cover and thought it would be perfect and it was priced reasonable. I ordered it and it came a few days later. The only problem was the cover that was shipped was not the cover from the ad. The cover will work however I'm disappointed I didnt get what I ordered.
1,My frank openion with my love & Blessings,"Dear all, with all my respect to the writer, it looks that he missed many many points about Jesus.The Most important is that Jesus is God in flesh,second Jesus as flesh died but was risen by the power of God the Father.I can add many many points, but this is not the right place to add more than few points.But it looks that for sure the writer dose not know ANYTHING about Jesus nor about the Bible.This book is very poor concerning theology.dear Mr. Mark(the writer) I pray that Jesus blesses u & open your eyes to see Him clearly, read the Bible pls and pray that God might bless u.I am writting this message out of LOVE, the love of God, the real God. (agape_saves@hotmail.com)"
1,Liar,"it was a wast of MoneyThese Writer Claimed That he was A Muslim And he did Study in The Al Azhar Islamic Univesity ............ect. But i CAn tell from His Face that He never was A Muslim. Some one would say this is only a personal openion.... but i would say this writer intenionally used to lie on us tills wrongfull stories about the prophet Mohammad and if did study Islam in the Al azhar Uni. he would Known better.... but im sure this man just looking to make money from this cheap job and claiming that he knows the Islam better than any oneMy letter to the writer is:I Have seen a lot of the Egypyian Coptic trying to mislead Muslims and None Muslim ,and that is only another example in this case . if you dont like Islam Thats Fine with us we the Muslims ,you are free to choose, but to lie on us and our Prophet History this is not acceptaple, and not profisional attituedPeace be Upon All The Prophets from Adams to the last Prophet of this life Mohammad Son of Abdullah"
4,Worth your time!,Well written. Honest gracious attitude toward his fellow Egyptian brothers. He has a very Christian attitude. I pray he will be able to help many to understand why Jesus died for us instead of killing us because we were his enemies.
3,South Sea Vagabound,"This book is in very good order, but it is a paper back and does not have the photos in as the hard cover does."
3,Rainbow Dist,"Rainbow Dust is a very engrosing, well crafted and researched, story with a pleasant mixture of suspense and mystery, happines and sadness. Once started, I felt that I couldn't put it down.There were several passages that brought back memories, one in particular. Purple Passion (aka Purple Jesus). I must have drunk a bath tub of it in college sixty years ago.Rainbow Dust is a great read and I highly recommend itRichard BuggVenice, FL"
5,I loved this book,"Caution: If you read the first page of ""Rainbow Dust"" you won't be able to put it down. This book is totally original and totally entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Paranormal Fantasy Moves with Big Ideas,"Roth brings in ideas which inform the paranormal ideology in a way which romance readers can understand: the elasticity of time, the collective unconscious, channeling, and shared visualizations. If souls are created by the strength of love, then the character Zeke must have been loved, despite his antics. Roth's unique journey through the psycho-social complexities of this world is handled with a light touch. We see the central character, Margaret, become an individual as her issues in the family drama are revealed. This strange story--which Roth insists is largely true-- has enough touchstones of the human drama to pique your interest in the realm of possibilities...."
4,An Engrossing Fantasy,"This is a delightful fantasy about a paranormal interaction of a socially inhibited professor, Margaret Knowles, and Zeke, an unknown voice from the dead. The author, Eleanor Roth, artfully tells how their encounter transforms Margaret's romantic life while unfolding the mystery of Zeke. Here is a well-written book that is both captivating and fun to read."
4,"almost perfect , but could be better","Any one who uses this stand daily knows how handy it is , it's light , easy to set up and break down , and is pretty compact. I use it for a dewalt 12"" miter saw. The stand beats the hell out of dragging out saw horses and a cutting board for most jobs.What could be better ?1. Two of the material supports are not enough if you are working with long material, I immediately purchased another set which really helped out.2. The material support/stops really need to be wider, another two inches at least. when cutting 7 1/2"" base , it has two be laying down and is constantly sliding off the narrow supports.Hope the review is helpful , overall I am very satisfied with the stand and would buy again without a second thought about it."
5,Best money spent in a long time,"This item is by far, well worth the money. It is very sturdy and can be setup in just about a minute. No more saw horses and plywood as a base. My stand did arrive with three small dents in the top, probably from shipping. None the less it did work very well from day one."
4,Good Stuff Can't Complain,"Very sturdy materials good support, the plastic parts of it seems a little cheap, but guess you can't have everything, over i would recommend this product and it gets the job done. only way i would bump this up to 5 stars if i still have this product in 5 years. but 4 star for a newer owner of it."
5,worth the money,"This is a pricey but well-engineered accessory for any DeWalt miter saw. Very sturdy construction with folding legs that are solid and wobble-free. The extension arms are completely adjustable for a wide variety of cutting positions. I especially like the quick release brackets that allow you to use the saw stand-alone when needed. A carrying handle makes the saw stand portable to a job site, but the weight is heavy enough that you don't want to move it often."
4,Works with Makita,"I was a little apprehensive since some reviewers could not use it with their Makita LS1013 sliding compound. Well, it fits perfectly(just barely). I would suggest that you remove the rubber feet on the Makita(just pull) before you mount it on the supporting brackets. If you don't you'll notice that half the feet hang over the edge of the bracket but if you do, the saw mounts solidly against the bracket. One annoying thing about the stand is that as you extend the side supports they tend to droop alittle the farther out you go, which you can compensate for by adjusting the height slightly...but why should I have to. Other than that, IMHO I think it is the best stand on the market if you're looking for a portable, sturdy and quick to set up stand."
5,Dewalt Miter Saw Stand,This product was received as described by the seller. I used it several times and I'm pleased with my purchase.
3,Great piece & price...lousy shipping care & open box!,"DEWALT DW723 Miter Saw Stand at a very good price but delivered killed by UPS (Uniformly Poor Service)handling. It was in an open box, resealed by a few pieces of tape. One knob was broken, had adented leg and feet that appear used. Maybe that's why the good price. Strangely the replacement was delivered pretty much the same way, only without the broken parts. Taking it back to UPS was a hassle. Their people are as about as nice as the counter folks at the post office. I figure I have about five hours of my time, and more...since I could not use the first one when it arrived, so the $219 with ""free"" shipping was not such a good deal.Is there an upside...yes! This is the first such problem ever with an Amazon purchase and they acted quickly to correct it. Would I do it again? No, the dewalt store had the same piece for the same price, in a factory sealed box, just plus state tax. I've had more than the tax in hassle.That's the way it was..."
2,Minnesota Charlie,"I purchased this stand in Feb. for my new Dewald DW712 slider. It is a perfect set up and fits the saw like a glove (almost like they should be sold as a set). Now I don't have to set up blocks of wood and extra saw horses to hold my work for ease of cutting. The extentions and height of the stand make my work more enjoyable, safer, decreases frustration and increases productivity. The box arrived damaged but the stand was in good shape. In defense of Fed-Ex the box is long, heavy and awkward to handle and it is a wonder that more damage did't occur but it is packaged pretty good. Thanks again to Amazon for the best prices. I rate it 5 stars not 2 stars."
4,Pretty Good (revised),"Good stand, works well with my makita 12"" miter saw. One complaint is that the knobs on the sides of the stand are plastic. When you retract the movable sides all the way in the plastic knobs are vulnerable to breaking. If you set the stand on end you could snap the cheap plastic knobs right off. Also over time the yellow parts that support the material loosen easily ... and its a pain to retighten on the job-site because it requires an allen wrench to do. But having owned this for several years now I can say it has exceeded my expectations for the price I paid."
5,Simply Wonderful,"I had doubts about miter stands (after seeing ones in Lowes and Home Depot), but this stand is well worth the money. It is very sturdy and lightweight. I have a Makita 10"" Compound Slide which fits perfectly on this stand with the attachments. I highly recommend this!"
3,Not for commercial production work,"This is a nice stand if you are cutting short narrow stock and don't mind measureing and marking every piece you cut. I cut a lot of 16' and 12' wide stock for stair skirts, beam wraps, closet shelving etc. There is no fence or bed so the waste end of long wide stock tends to fall off on the floor. There is no tape or positive stops so repetive cuts like door legs have to be measured and cut over and over or you have to build a jig. A much better stand is the Sawhelper. [..]"
5,Perfect Gift for your handyman,My husband had this on his wish list. The price was far below the other sites I searched. The product arrived just in time for Christmas as promised. He couldn't have been happier. He set it up right away and has been using it to craft amazing trim and molding in our house. He also bought the rebuilt DeWalt dual miter saw with the same results. Perfect. We both highly recommend this product.
5,Fantastic stand,"I was torn between the Bosch T4B and this stand, but after looking at them both and playing with them in the store I chose the Dewalt for the additional length 16' which is perfect for the type of work I do floor and cornice moulding. Yes it isn't as portable, but my wife would kill me if I rolled a stand over her hard wood floors to where I'm working, besides the Dewalt is really easy to move around since it folds down into a very compact package and is very easy to move around in tight spaces. So this stand was an easy choice for me. I mounted a Milwaukee mitre saw and it is rock solid and since the stand can hold up to 400 lbs it is super sturdy and with the additional length it is hard to beat."
5,Better than the Bosch T4B,"Great stand. Simple,light, has stops for repeated lengths, breaks down quick, saw mounts are easy to setup and use. The best feature is the lack of parts. The Bosch T4B was my first choice but after using a friends I ordered the Dewalt. The T4B has way too many parts that can fail. The saw mount tension rod broke on the T4B the day I used it. It's also enormous and weighs twice what this thing weighs."
5,Love this!,"Great product. Using it with a Dewalt 12"" compound sliding miter saw. Makes the job so much easier than cutting things with the saw on the floor."
5,One Tough Tank !!,My children all got together and bought this for me for my birthday. (My wife told them what I wanted.) Comparing this unit to others proved it to be the toughest out there. It's strong but light. Very stable with the DW708 compound saw mounted. Other manufacturers are good but they don't compare. It sets up quickly and adjusts to small or very large work. I strongly recommend this for DeWalt or other saw owners.
4,"Product is everything I expected, accept!","I just received my miter stand and was happy to see it, being inthe middle of a kitchen project. I am quite frankly tired ofjury rigging stands or elsewise scurrying across the flooradjusting and making cuts. The product arrived safe and soundvia FEDEX, so previous reviews must have gotten Amazon to shipa safer way, even with the free shipping! It all setup nicelyand I like the quick detach feature for the saw and easystorage. I am not by no means a pro woodworker and everythingworks well for me and I am sure it will stand up well to theuse I subject it to. The only reason I did not give it 5 starsis what I read on the box, MADE IN CHINA. I was disappointedthat a company like DeWalt had also gone to offshore manufactuering.It is giving me second thoughts on the DeWalt miter saw I was planning on buying."
4,"Questionable item shipped, Previously owned & returned?","The stand is a great stand, yet it came in without all the fasteners and with a large dent in one of the legs. This was ordered as a new item and was received completely sealed. I am unsure of when the damage occurred, yet it was still missing fasteners with the bag already ripped open inside the sealed box. Be sure you are completely familiarized with the return policy before you buy from Amazon. Be patient.......or just live with the item and learn from the experience."
4,"Solid, easy set-up","While not dripping with features, this stand is light, quick and easy to set up on site and rock solid. ..."
4,Required Accessory for DeWalt Compound Miters,"I originally borrowed a DeWalt compound Miter Saw and this stand from my friend to work on my deck project. After a while, he needed his back so I went out and bought a DeWalt 12"" Compound Miter Saw and this stand. They work great together and were out in the yard everyday I was working on the deck. Couldn't imagine not having this stand with the compound miter; wouldn't have been half as productive.Very sturdy and easily adjustable for different length boards. Handled every piece of material I threw at it!"
4,Great stand for moving around,"It's fast and easy to set up right out of the box, lightweight but solid and sturdy, and takes up little space when collapsed. I'm really impressed with the length that it extends out to, but just like many other reviews noted you lose support for the work piece when the arms are extended. It comes with two support arms that could be placed on one side of the saw, but that only works if you're just cutting a little off the end. After I purchased the stand, I decided to go back and order another 2 DW7232 support arms. If you only work with stiff material, you wouldn't need it, but if you're working with trim it helps to have the extra support."
4,Dewalt Mitre saw stand,This product performs as advertised. It was easy to assemble and instructions were brief but adequate. The saw mounted to the table easily (I did this myself) and the saw is quite stable while cutting any length boards. I also purchased the laser line and it really helps with making repeat and accurate cuts. The laser seems like an essental accessory. I would have liked some scale on the table.Good value.
2,Not as good as DeWalt makes it out to be,"I bought this saw for the primary reason that it's lightweight, which is great for portability. It folds up nicely and can be stood up in a corner for storage. The ""Universal Fit"" really only applies to DeWalt's line of miter saws (no surprise, but misleading).My Hitachi C12LSH is not one of the saws that fits properly. If I were to mount the saw to a piece of plywood as they recommend, the deck height of the saw would be about 1/4"" higher than the highest setting on the rest/stops when they're placed right next to the saw. It gets even worse when the stops are placed on the extendable arms, they're about 1/2"" below deck height. The arms themselves are flimsy, they sag very badly and don't slide in and out of the housing very well. I'm really disappointed in the reduction in quality of DeWalt's tools. Most of my older tools are DeWalt, are they're great, but the newer ones are junk."
4,"Great Stand, I recommend it.","I love that this was easy to set up and ready to use right out of the box. It is well balanced, portable, and well made. The support stops leave room for improvement but work ok. That weak area is why I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star. I also recommend buying the DW7231 Miter Saw Mounting Brackets. These brackets are great for attaching a small work area (I made mine out of inch and an eighth plywood with oak edging)which also accomidates a drop in router."
5,Works as advertised,"I have a Bosch 4412 (12"" slider) which is heavy and awkward to move around. 90% of the use of the saw is in the garage and 10% onsite. My inclination was to buy the Bosch stand but wasn't thrilled with the reviews and could not find one locally. After reading the great reviews on the DeWalt, I ran to my local HD to get one. For what I need, it is perfect. Installation was a breeze even though proper installation required that I drill a couple holes in the base of the saw. The mounting holes in the saw are not colinear.The support arms at full extension do sag a little. So far, I have not found this to be a big problem. It took less than 30 minutes to install the saw on the stand. The brackets that mount to the bottom of the saw secure the saw to the stand in seconds. The brackets also come with rubber feet so you can place the saw on any surface when the stand is not needed. DeWalt kept this stand perfectly simple."
2,over prices,This stand is way over priced . you can get a better stand for half the price . to make this stand better. build some wings so you dont have to always adjust the arms and also makes cutting crown and base alot easer also take the mounts given with the stand and mount them to a piece of 3/4 ply so you dont have to fight getting youre saw set up and you can just srwe the saw to the platform using the holes in the base . the stops that come with the saw suck so throw them away .
3,"Great product, good price, terrible service","As is typical, Amazon managed to totally screw up my order and delivered the miter saw stand over a month after the promised delivery date. Thanks again, Amazon, for spoiling my husband's birthday. The picture of the stand in his card made a great gift."
5,Excellent Song!!,"I really love this song. It is one of my favorites at the moment. I came across this music video on Nickelodeon, and was amazed. Kaci has such a great voice for a 13 year old. I can't wait for more of her music to come out."
3,"Okay She Isn't That Good, But She Isn't Bad.","I first heard Kaci when she opened for O-Town, on their fair tour I guess. Yeah she was not good, and yeah she only gets airplay on Radio Disney. But Radio Disney does spin my friends band Townsend, so they can't be all that bad right? Well sorry Radio Disney, but this girl is not a winner. Her weak vocals and strong backbeats might as well just make her a DJ. But her songs do have that sugar coating that I guess we can only call cavity causing. Well Kaci maybe in a few years you will be as good as your label mate Leann Rimes. Keep trying you may have a hit in your home country yet."
2,Un-Impressive,"I first saw a bio of Kaci on the news since she is from my hometown area. I, quite frankly, am dissapointed. She may be able to carry a tune, but is this really all she could be?Her vocals are pretty and simplistic, yet she depends on the background music to make her voice sound strong. She has sadly fallen into the annoyingly undying crevice of half-way performances. The only place she is spun is on Radio Disney. Yes, sometimes they know what's good music, more than any critic I know. But, for God's sake, they play Hoku, Aaron Carter, and Dreamstreet every 15 minutes. (3 of the worst childrens entertainers. No offense to Aaron's brother Nick). Please, if you are contemplating purchasing this CD-Single, wait for Kaci to grow up. Then, she might have a happy career ahead of her. (Go buy ""So Together"" by Innosense in the meantime. K.I.S.S. 4EVER)"
5,One of the best of '97,Incredible work from Icelandic group...I had an opportunity to meet these guys (and girl) following a concert and they are perhaps the nicest people on the face of the earth. Love 'em!!
3,Tell me why,"I was actualy quite bored by the majority of this album. Dull, uninspired electro-casiotone-moog beats combine with dull moaning vocals (on most of the tracks) to create the perfect background music for parking lot attendants, toll booth operators, and inmates of federal prisons. There is, however, one saving grace to this album and that is track #7, ""Why?"". This song alone isn't enough to make the album worth the purchase price but almost. The main reason this song is so remarkable is the extrordinary vocal beauty they found to sing it- too bad they didn't use her for more tracks. The male vocal on the rest of the album is SO monotonous, depressing, and deadly boring. This is a great album to sleep to, provided that you don't need to wake up."
4,Even Your Mom Will Like It,"Here's an ideal album for bringing non-electronic folks into the fold. Unlike many dance artists, Gus Gus manages to keep the songs well-structured, and to hold our interest even out of the clubs and off the dance floor. The addition of Christian imagery throughout oddly doesn't detract from the package (most Contemporary Christian artists should take note). Highlights include ""Believe"" and the oft-noted ""Gun"" and ""Purple""."
3,Very Different but Hard to Forget,"This is the first CD released by Gus Gus that I know of. The first song that I heard off of this CD was ""Purple."" It is a great song that will be enjoyed by any fan of techno music. The main reason why I bought this CD was for the song ""Gun."" Anyone who has seen the movie Suicide Kings has heard this song. It is absolutely amazing and would be completely enjoyed by anyone who enjoys electronica style music. The rest of the music on this CD is interesting and may only appeal to a handful of listeners. However both ""Gun"" and ""Purple"" are songs that will keep you coming back for more."
4,A complete album,"It's hard to find an album that can be listened to straight through. This is one of those rare albums, so snatch it up. Very different and very interesting. The vocals are... eh, but the music excels, and makes up for it. Best track is, by far, ""Believe."""
4,amazing aerobic workout... some volume issues though,"This is my 3rd Spinervals DVD. LIke the previous two, the content is fantastic. At two hours in length, it is a wonderful aerobic session. I was soaked with sweat and my heart rate was elevated in a sustained manner. With longer intervals (some 20 minutes in length!) it was a great session to work on sustained effort.The only minus I noted was that some of the recording volumes were low. During some of the sessions, even with the volume turned all the way up I could barely hear Troy talking. I could still figure out what to do and it wasn't really detrimental, just annoying. Because of that though, I couldn't give it five stars.Overall a wonderful video I will use again and again."
4,Photogenic Silk roads,"Just for the photos alone, this book is worth purchasing. In addition, it provides a fascinating overview of the history of the various cultures, religions, trade products, explorers and adventurers who have made the words ""silk road"" evocative of a mythical and exotic time and place."
3,Too much detail (in a negative sense),"It did not take me much (some 10-20 pages) to realize that this book would not give me what I wanted. I hate ""microscopic"" narratives: what I want from an introductory book is a global vision on the subject. If, and only if, the author writes magnifically, I would not mind to have a thorough description of any very specific details. I don't think Frances Wood really qualifies for this. In my (amateur) view, she gives a poor general insight on the Silk Road, spending about half the book's length describing every saleable item one could find in any point along the Silk Roads! This, together with the excessive and long quotations she pours in every 3-4 pages or so, makes this book rather boring. I don't regret having spent money on it, and I'm glad I read it, because this is indeed an interesting book, with good illustrations, and because the Silk Roads are a very fascinating subject. But I really expected this book to be more exciting."
5,"the best book about ""the"" silk road","This is the best of all the many books I've read about ""the"" silk road, since I have been visiting Gansu province, China, for the past ten years. It is very informative, as well as beautifully illustrated and engagingly written. Wood adeptly covers the subject from varied perspectives: historical, geographical, cultural, artistic, political,etc. Superb!"
4,Overall Good Drill,"I've had mine for over 6 months and for the most part have been pretty satisfied. It's powerful ( 450 in/lbs of torque ), lightweight, well balanced, and a great value with a low price and 2 batteries and a one hour charger. Compared to other 14.4 drills, it's very competitve. The only thing that I don't like is the run time. I personally think the run time is weak, but 1) I'm used to using 24 volts and 2) I haven't compared it with my 14.4 DeWalt and PC. Overall, this is a pretty good drill for just about anyone"
5,Cool CD,"Ok, first off this cd is really hard east bay. It is harder than hard, lets just say, so if you are in the mood for hard stuff, get this album. But a lot of the songs are really satanic, like ""The Devil Loves You"" and a few others. Some songs are just weird like ""Lower your head and take it in the body. I gave it 5 stars because this album was really the change of AFI, with the new bassist at hand, and new really weird artwork. So buy it if you like that hard sound, good album, but I guess not a MUST for an AFI fan because of the weird satanic stuff in it.Check out my other reviews with other AFI albums...."
5,Definitly AFI's best work,"For a band claiming themselves ""East Bay Hardcore"" this is the only release I've heard so far that lives up to that label.This is AFI's most aggressive angry move towards a harder sound while Very Proud Of Ya and Answer That And Stay Fashionable were great albums , just standard East Bay punk with a more popped up edge. ""A Single Second"" is without a doubt the best one here. Then there is ""Triple Zero"" , ""Salt For Your Wounds"" , ""Third Season"" , and a cover of Filth's ""Today's Lesson""...great stuff"
1,Just doesn't do it for me,"I'm a big AFI fan, but this is my least favorite album. It just doesn't do it for me."
4,from a new afi fan...,"i just needed to say that i love all of afi's old stuf, this DEFINATELY included...my personal favorite song is A Single Second- its just an all-around awesome track...great guitar!! :D i think its daveys voice that really does it for me...if your getting frustrated cuz i just keep saying things that you really dont care about, nobody said you had to listen to me...read some other reviews and then decide...but hey, if you wanna listen to me, i say GO BUY THIS CD!!!"
3,Shut Your Mouth and Listen to what I tell you.,"AFI's third proper album is an improvement over the previous releases (not hard to really top the first two, as they are wretched excuses for music). This album is, I think, their best attempt at hardcore as many of the songs are fast and abrasive and yet still remain melodic. Along with the music; Davey's lyrics seem to have matured greatly over time, and now are starting to show subtle signs of the ""I'm sad, I go cry now"" mentality that they would eventually succumb to. I don't consider this an essential AFI release as it doesn't really feel like it's representative of what AFI is all about but should you be a completist, as I am, I don't think you'd find this unlistenable. Key Tracks: Three Reasons, A Single Second, Let It Be Broke."
2,"Ahh it's cold and it's biting me,um","... I thought it would be great considering that it's AFI, but it's not. Mark is bad at guitar, Jade Puget blows him away....the music isn't very good and way too repetitive, same old punk beats from Adam...yeah, Davey's vocals are actually pretty good on here, as well as the lyrics...but that's the only strong point. Hunter wasn't even the permanent bass player in the band when this came out. Maybe I'll change my mind later, but the music is not that good and not even Davey's more aggressive singing style on here can make up for that. I suggest ""Black Sails in the Wind"" that's even better than their new album. I'm going to go see them on March 10th in Santa Cruz...yes!!!"
5,WONDERFUL MEMORIES in the making...,"I read this book as a child. It was wonderful to imagine the terrible tiger gnashing his terrible teeth, eating up people ... only to have them get out unharmed.=)"
5,True to JMU,Florence has done an excellent job capturing the true life of a JMU student. This young writer is destined for the top.
2,I can't bring myself to finish it.,"I'm on Tape 2 of the unabridged audio version, and find myself unable to continue. It was very difficult to keep the characters straight when they were all introduced at the business meeting (no family tree on tape!). However, I kinda managed to get past that. My problem is the mystery angle; I just don't care who offed the old lady! These are stock characters to me, with a bit of melodrama thrown in.I can fully understand the author's wanting to branch out beyond Judge Knott (whose books I really like). This effort seemed a slightly wishy-washy way of doing so in having a similar enough protagonist and being set in the same area as the Knott series."
3,"Ho Hum, Yet Readable","It's easy to see why Maron is a queen of mystery. Her stories seem to flow from her pen without much hesitation or loss of narrative thread.However, it may be this very ease that makes this story lacking in depth. Maron writes a good mystery, but it could be a great one if she gave more time to character development, interaction, and plot.While her characters are interesting, they seem flat, two-dimensional, as does the plot. The resolution of the mystery and the various relationship issues between the characters was a letdown, ending with a whimper, not a bang.Still, a decent story. But what does the title have to do with the book? Hate that."
3,Missing Deb'rah,"I enjoyed this book, but I missed Deborah Knott and Mr. Kezzie and the others. I was glad to see Dwight and the FBI man show up but wished they had been more instrumental in the plot. Certainly worth your time, but not as funny as the other books by Ms. Maron."
5,An outstanding product,"Between this bosch and the Makita's , which I looked at, the Bosch was the best in terms of build qaulity and overall stability. Makita makes very many good products. I have 2 sanders and a 12"" miter saw and they are extremely reliable and dependable. However, I've begun to buy several Bosch products, most of which are very impressive, including this circular saw. It just feels as if it will last a long time and can be counted on for performing everytime time it is needed. The only other circular saw which I considered was the Metabo's, but since the price is prohibitive, I went with the Bosch. The Bosch is a bit heavier than the Makita and feels as if it is riding on rails when gliding though the workpiece. Very stable. An excellent saw that is comletely satisfying in every way."
1,fake,"This is actually a review I wrote for the Bosch planer. But as I already had written a previous review It would not allow a 2nd one. So I am writing it here.I think some of these reviews are fake. After cmy problems with this planer I noticed that some of the other reviews were so glowing. so I clicked on "" Ted Peterson"".Surprise, surprise. He has made 8 reviews. All 8 were Bosch products!! All 8 were rated 5 star!! And all 8 were gushy in their praising of Bosch perfection. All 8 repeatedly mentioned the Bosh name and could not find ONE bad thing to mention in the performance of 11 tools. Have you ever bought 11 perfect tools?Same for "" Skip Morris"". 9 reviews. 9 Bosch tools ( and nothing else). Nine 5 star reviews. Nine Bosch love affairs.I think they work for Bosch."
1,Worst Tool I ever Bought,The first time I used the saw I crosscut 2x4 lumber and it stopped working after one cut. The motor doesn't make any noise at all....nothing. I have purchased thousands of dollars worth of tools and have never had one fail as fast as this. I have also never purchased a Bosch product before and doubt I ever will again.
1,Land only,"Very sad toy. The plane looks cheap and would not fly. I have read reviews on this site that speak of the plane flying well or getting away. Ours banked left and crashed every time. We re-read instructions, tried it off the vehicle (fully charged and on pavement) and tried throwing it as book suggested. We took care to attempt our launches into the wind. All this plane ever did was crash. Two days of trying and back to the store it went. The truck ran well, but the plane needed wheels too."
4,"FUN, FUN, FUN!!!","My son received this as a gift. He is only 5 years old but is able to enjoy it with supervision. If you ensure you have plenty of space and fly it on a non-windy day, the plane flies great. The car is also plenty of fun. We have crashed the plane many times and it is still working fine. Fun, fun, fun!!!"
2,A BIG WASTE OF MONEY!,"As a ground vehicle it operated great. As trying to lauch the plane from the land vehicle like advertised on TV and in the instructions, the plane just nose-dived. The plane had to be hand launched. The plane was extremely hard to fly by all that tried even by a 15 year experienced person to RC planes. The plane had a mind of its own after it got about 50 feet away from controller. My son was very disapointed as this was the first Christmas gift from Santa that was a big piece of junk."
1,DO NOT BUY IT ITS A PEICE OF JUNK,"Ok, so i got this car/plane as a present mostly because i just wanted a plane i can steer left/right and up/down. BUT the plane never really worked. I charged it and threw it on a non windy day and it flew in a straight line, im not stupid i checked to see if the controller was on and on air setting and tried to fly it again and i had no control. So i returned it becuase it thought it might be defective and got another one and it did the same thing and flew in a straight line or anywhere a gentle breeze took it, I HAD no control. The car worked OK but instead of spending 50 bucks for a plane and a car just pay 20 for a much nicer car. ooo yea the car and the plane use the batteries in about 15 min if you use them together. Im 14 and this is defintly a peice of JUNK SO DONT BUY IT!!!!!"
1,yauhhhhcccccckkkkkk,"I had this toy for christmas and when I went to fly it,it just kept doing loops and it then went down and crashed on top of Bombon [my puppy] and boy I laugthed so much that I fell.Then it went up and it went far that I was out of range with it and the motors stopped turning and it crashed.But I had fun with the car,it went so fast that in a race with the car,I beat it, but when I pressed TURBO it beated me.I really had fun with the car,but I LIKED it,THANKS SANTA."
1,Grandma very disappointed and angry.,"I'm so angry - what business does a toy company have selling a toy and misleading it's customers. No warning were displayed regarding the additional ""batteries"". For the most part ""Grandparents"" (me being one of them) rely on information provided with the on-line purchases. NO where was there any indication that an additional $20.00 battery was need; and what kind a fool would I look like if ""Grandma"" didn't buy what the toy needed. I live 1,500 miles from my Grandson and had this item purchased and sent there; now over 1 week later I am now finishing my Christmas shopping."
4,Land Air RC Great Toy,I was amazed at the durability of this item. The plane is better than any I've played with. The vehicle is super fast. You can play with each alone or together. It's two toys in one. The plane doesn't break apart like most. I love this toy.
1,Poor All The Way Around,This toy was a complete disappointment for the price. A styrofoam plane and does not even include the battery kit required to operate it. There are far better options out there for the money in the R/C world. Pass on this one.
1,I Gave It 1 Star because 0 Was Not An Option.,"I wish I had read the first and only review prior to buying this item because everything they said was accurate. Except they left out a few things. The plane is not just styrofoam, but cheap looking styrofoam and it comes without the decals applied. You have to apply them yourself. Besides the optional and expensive battery pack, you have to buy additional batteries as well. There are better and way more reasonable choices. I wish I had talked my grandson out of wanting this so badly."
3,Good and bad,"i got one last year and it was worth it,then , about 3 months ago i tried driving it up a hill and it broke! it is a lot of fun, but your child will be dissapointed when he finds out that the plane is immpossible to keep from dive bombing ,and it breaks after about 8 month of regular use.great fun, but not completely worth the money."
1,Not the Book You Need for Japan Travel,"I've used Lonely Planet Guides for my many trips abroad but the Japan Travel Guide is by far the most confusing and contains very few maps, directions, and information. I spent the majority of my time asking locals how to get to a location because the Lonely Planet guide did not provide a map or even directions for that matter. In Japan you need a map and a good one at that. You will spend the majority of your time walking the city and taking trains and you need to have a grasp of the area. This book did not provide any of that and it made me question Lonely Planet's quality and substance."
2,A Great Way to Get Unexcited About Your Trip to Japan,"This Lonely Planet Guide is another copy of all the previous Japan guides with all the same disappointments.Coverage of areas outside of Tokyo and Kyoto is honestly rather shoddy, and they've kept the obnoxious negativity that makes an exciting trip to Japan seem like a waste of time. While other Lonely Planet guides are lively, with authors that seem to enjoy the travelling, Lonely Planet Japan's authors write as though they really don't like Japan. It is questionable whether or not the writers even visited the cities they are reviewing.This guide is probably most useful as a reference of places to look up on your own in another source."
2,Don't waste your time/money/vacation,"This book was only marginally useful.- The maps were ambiguous at best, and completely wrong at worst (on multiple instances in multiple cities).- Descriptions of sights were often wrong or misleading (don't bother with the ""Pentax Forum"" in tokyo. the address is wrong, and once you find it, it's completely lame (old cameras, and you can't even play with stuff, contrary to the book)- Does NOT have the actual cheapest budget hostels in Kyoto or Tokyo.- I didn't really like the writing style, but that's preference- the eating establishments they suggest are completely random and often not the best/cheapest/or most interesting.everyone i met traveling that had the rough guide was happy with it. in 20/20 hindsight i wish I had bought that book. everyone I met that had this book was equally disappointed."
4,At its best before leaving when you're preparing your trip!,"I went to Japan alone this summer for a duration of 25 days. This book was very useful to prepare the trip and I think it's where the book is at its best. They give nice advices, thoughts and ideas about where to go according to how much time you will stay there.However, once in Japan, the book isn't that much useful. Every information center in Japan cities are really good and can provide you better maps and sights location than in the book. But it's still a ""Must"" to read, I would say, three to five months before your trip. Plus, at least a fast reading overview six to seven months before your trip because there are a lot of things to think about to be well-prepared."
3,Lonely planet: good contents poor graphics and suggestions,"Although Lonely Planet has good contents about all the places to visit, the suggested walks aren't as good as others. The complete descripitions of all the places doesn't orientate first vists wiht ""don't live Tokyo withot.."" suggestions. Terrible maps and no pictures make this guide a real bible.. not to talk about its size..."
2,Lonely Planet Off Course,"I usually trust Lonely Planet to give good recommendations, but this time it let me down. They may have done a good job in some other travel countries but not Japan. After a year of living in Japan, I have explored many of the main tourist places. I get the feeling that the writers may have been in a big hurry when they wrote the Japan guide. Sometimes I wonder if they visited many of the places they suggest at all. Their visit recommendations are no better than you could easily find on a basic internet search, the maps are vague, the restaurants are often disappointing. It's also longer overdue for an update. Maybe they'll do better next time."
4,Little space for so much to do!,The book is nice but I found there are more things to do in some cities than what it says in the book.
3,"Good information, However...",Lots of good information in this book. However I did find that the size was annoying to carry around. I recently took a trip to Tokyo and I felt that if I could just the useful phrases out it would've been more useful. Perhaps I should've grabbed the Tokyo only version of the book. I plan on visiting the rest of Japan so I wanted to have that information too so I guess thats my fault. If you are JUST going to Tokyo get the Tokyo only book duh. :)
3,Giant Book,"I really liked this book as a kid. The art is clear and bright, and the story about a boy learning monsters _do_ exist but not getting hurt by them was oddly comforting to me as a child."
5,"Lounge, Mood and Smooth Instrumental","A very classic, smooth, absolutely essential Benson album,exactly as a Benson lover would expect. Classic yet moving pieces, great feelings listening to these arrangements. For the Benson connoisseurs a must have."
2,Elevator Music,"Don't be fooled by the reviews. If you're looking for some jazz, don't buy this album. This is a CD of easy-listening music. If you're looking for some jazz guitar, check out the early CDs like George Benson Cookbook or the stuff he recorded with Brother Jack McDuff. I guess this stuff is okay to put on while watering the plants, but there is no substance to this ear candy. What a waste of talent. And George QUIT SINGING YOUR GUITAR SOLOS. It's bad enough that you sing, but singing during a solo just diminishes both the singing and the guitar playing. YAWN!"
4,"good, but may be overkill for some","I really enjoyed this book, especially the anecdotes in the introduction, but I can't realy see alot of applications for a ""crash-course"" that is this long. There are many situations I can envision where someone would need to learn about telecom networks quickly, but they probably wouldn't need to know many of the intricacies that Shepard deals with and they almost certainly wouldn't be interested in his anecdotes and discussion of undersea cable laying.However, I don't know of any other comprehensive book like this so it may be your only option. Either way I certainly enjoyed reading it and intend to buy his other books, but to read at my leisure."
5,It really is a crash-course,"I work in I.T., but after 10 years in healthcare and taking a job at a communications company, this really helped me get up to speed on how the phone system actually works."
1,Simply Brutal,"I recently joined a Telecom company as a Marketing Manager, and wanted to acquaint myself with the technologies in our industry, so I picked up this book. BIG MISTAKE! I assumed ""Crash Course"" was meant for beginners like me - with little or no knowledge of telecom technology. Again, big mistake. This book is very poorly organized, doesn't take time to explain important concepts clearly, and it even lacks a glossery of terms (which is pretty bad considering this is suppose to be an introduction to a complicated topic). Take my advice and take a pass on this one."
3,"Works, but could definitely use improvement","The hole is not large enough to fit on an Olympic bar. You have to use the magnets to attach them to other weights, however, they do not stick well to rubber coated Olympic weights, like the VTX series. I have to attach them to the bar itself. That works OK, but they really should just make the hole about 1/4"" bigger to let them slide onto the bar."
4,Just a pinch !!,"These little guys are good for that extra nudge ""over the edge"". They're a little pricey though which is why I wouldn't give them a ""5"" star."
4,The Jewish experience in Brazil,"""The Gods of Raquel"" is a novel by Moacyr Scliar, the great Jewish writer from Brazil. The book has been translated from Portuguese into a very readable English by Eloah P. Giacomelli. This novel tells the life story of Raquel Szenes, a girl who is born into a Hungarian Jewish family that has emigrated to Brazil in search of a better life.Scliar narrates both the events of Raquel's life, as well as the inner world of her troubled dreams and fantasies. Many of Raquel's inner and outer struggles involve coming to terms with her Jewish identity. Early in the book, she deals with the complexity of dealing with being a Jewish student at a Catholic school. As she matures into a young woman, we accompany her on her quest for love, friendship, and sexual fulfillment. ""The Gods of Raquel"" is not Scliar's best work, but it is still a fascinating and valuable glimpse into Brazilian Jewish life."
1,"Don't Waste Your Time, Or Your Money...","I was hoping for an insiders' view of Jimi's life and career.This film did not deliver.The interviews are pieced together with sealing-wax and string. In some instances, the interviews are factually incorrect or, at best, misleading.Example: anyone who has read about Jimi's life knows that he went into the Army because he got caught stealing cars, and it was either the Army or the Hoosgow for Jimi. This fact is passed over by Brother Leon, who suggests that Jimi woke up one morning and just decided to enlist. Pshaw !!I felt ripped-off by this film -- mediocre interviews, bad narration, and bad music. Move on to your next selection, and don't look back."
1,Needs more power,"We have this in the shop where I spend my evenings. It is hooked up to the jointer, and I can tell no difference when this vac is on or off.We have a 1 1/2 hp model with other tools and it keeps all chip outs and sawdust contained, even on the planer. But the single horse model can't handle the load and we end up with shavings from the jointer all over the shop.Pull the hose out of the dust port and try to vac with it and it does absolutely nothing.I suggest you spend the extra $100 and get the extra half horse, it is definitely worth it."
1,bull crap,"its a waste of money... it scratches more than the disc itself, so just be careful with the disc... just dont waste your money on this crap"
5,great,i think every one that love's there DVD'S AN CD'S should have these they keep them safe evan when plating
4,love these things-for a cost,"Simple review- if you are willing to pay money to protect your case, get these. Otherwise wait til they get a little scratched up, then simply take them to a store that uses a machine to buffer the scratches out.I hope this helped your opinion and saved stress on your eyes from reading so much"
1,CD Protectors,"This product may work for new factory made CDs or DVDs, but does not function with burned CDs in my car stereo system."
1,DONT BUY THIS,it plain and simple dosent work it is a scam/rip off i really needed something to protect my xbox 360 disks and this dosent work at all it makes the games slow and sometimes makes some weird sound when the game is spinning in my xbox im gonna try the discdefenders next hopefully those work better than this
2,Maybe good in limited instances,"I got a couple packs of these because my laptop tended to scratch disks a bit. Initially I thought they worked really well, but then I noticed they were causing the DVD drive to strain; I think they were just a little too wide and it wasn't worth the risk of burning out the drive. All disks read fine.These things seem like they fit some CDs really well, but on others they were either noticeably too big or occasionally too small. Ultimately, I've had an unopened container of them sitting on a shelf for over a year now with no plans to use them. That fact kind of says everything I need to say."
2,meh,"Is a godsend for idiots that don't have the common sense to take care of their CDs. however, for us regular folk these discs are too risky for use on our discs. I applied one to my San Andreas disc and it loads, but I can't leave the savehouse. the sound is distorted and it takes a while for the system to load."
1,Does not work on XBox 360,"Just a head's up - these do not seem to work on the XBOX 360 game system. The 360 is notorious for scratching disks (regardless of Microsoft postings, this happens even when the system is IMMOBILE). I thought these would protect the $60 games I bought, but the system will not read them. DO NOT BUY!"
3,Average,I bought these for my son to use. I am glad I bought a small package. We had trouble using them with some of our electronic devices.
1,"Zero Stars! Good Idea, bad implementation","It will destroy your cd's if even the smallest spec is between the skin and the disc... i consider myself paranoid and check the disks throughly befor applying the skin, i just found 3 discs destroyed BECAUSE OF THE D_SKIN!"
1,POOR PERFORMANCE ON DVDS!,"I AM A VIDEO RETAIL STORE OWNER WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE USING THIS PRODUCT ON DVDS. PLEASE NOTE: THIS PRODUCT IS FAR FROM PERFECTED AND I CAN ASSURE YOU IT WILL ONLY WORK,(IF IT WORKS AT ALL)WHEN IT FITS PERFECTLY AGAINST THE DVD, ALL RETAINING CLIPS ARE SECURELY MOUNTED AND IT IS APPLIED TO A CLEAN, UNSCRATCHED DISC. YOU WILL UNDOUBTEDLY EXPERIENCE PLAYABILITY ISSUES WITH CERTAIN BRANDS OF DVD PLAYERS, AND THE D-SKIN WILL LIKELY BE THE ISSUE.BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, I TRULY DO NOT FEEL THE PRODUCT MEETS EXPECTATIONS FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. YOU ARE LIKELY, AS I WAS, TO BE VERY DISAPPOINTED INDEED."
1,Not so great.,"I bought 2 packs of these. They do protect the cd's just fine, but in order to use the cd while it's on, they have to be in PERFECT condition. Unfortunately they are extremely easy to scratch, and even if they are in perfect condition, i have noticed skipping in gameplay and in music, not bad, but annoying. I cant believe they charge a dollar a peice for these. they are a ring of hard plastic, which clips onto the cd, and I think the part that covers the bottom of the CD is the same stuff that is wrapped around game and dvd cases when you buy them, flimsy plastic. I think they cost less then 1 cent to produce, and therefore should not cost more than 20-25 cents a peice. Conclusion... dont buy them."
1,don't believe it,"great concept, bad execution. Bought this product to protect my new Halo 2 disc for Xbox.. product fits like loose celophane wrapper and apparantly interferes with the Xbox read laser, because it states that the disc is unreadable! Able to get it to work only 2 times out of dozen's of try's..Maybe works for audio but not for xbox games!"
1,"Doesn't work on XBOX,Laptop and some data cd's!!","I bought these in hope that they would be the great thing that they are advertised to be. They weren't! First of all, when using them on an Xbox game, it GREATLY slows down the game, to the point that it is unplayable. When I tried to use these in my laptop, they were a no go! It wouldn't even read the disk and it sounded like my laptop was an airplane taking off due to my cd drive frantically trying to read the disk to no avail. On a desktop computer, it will read some data disks with the d-skin on it, but it's slow. You won't be watching an mpg or vcd movie with the d-skin on for instance. I don't know how well they work on a cd player with musical cd's, but anything else is definately out. Since I am an mp3 man, I have no need to play music cd's, so I haven't tried them. I wish these worked as promised, I REALLY do, it would be a dream. Perhaps someday this idea will be perfected and then I can give FIVE stars instead of ONE!"
2,Lomi ??? sucker stick !!,"Believe me, you could make this yourself. Just go to Home Depot or Lowes and get a pipe, bend it and put a cheap spongey material on it with two wood balls. Cheaply made, and only worth about 4 dollars."
3,Annexus Quam - 'Beziehungen' (Spalax) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1972,this was the little-known krautrock band's 2nd of just two albums.Another obscurity that's an acquired taste.Tracking list is as follows: ""Trobluhsel el E Isch""(5:29), the quite beautifully arranged as well as moody ""Leyenburg 1""(14:05), ""Dreh Dich Nicht Um""(16:20) and Leyenburg 2""(3:35). Line-up: Peter Werner-guitar, Martin Habenicht-bass, Hans Kamper-guitar,trombone&flute, Ove Volquartz-sax and Harald Klem-zither,tabla and guitar. Should appeal to fans of Ash Ra Tempel,Deuter,early Tangerine Dream and Yatha Sidhra."
5,A brilliant episode....Khan is fantastically evil!,"Khan Noonian Singh. One of my favorite villians of all time is introduced in this classic episode. A leader of the 20th century ""genetic wars"", Khan is banished to the SS Botany Bay which is adrift in space for over 200 years until the USS Enterprise finds it beaconing signal and beams over to investigate. Then the fun begins....Khan is taken to the Enterprise where nobody knows who he is yet, except maybe a lovely archeologist. When Khan is finally figured out, let's just say that his brilliant ""evil"" plan is almost carried out. One of Capt. Kirk's best nemisis to say the least. Khan and his crew of ""superior beings"" are sent to live on Seti Alpha 5 to start a colony on their own without help from the federation. People forget he and his people exist...Until 15 years later...Thus begins the movie Star Trek II: The wrath of Khan. What a great episode this is. Highly recommended.Remember what Khan says, ""Revenge is a dish best serve cold!"""
4,This episode gets a B+ grade and is in the Top 25,"A piece of one of history's great puzzles falls into place when Kirk's crew comes across the S.S. Botany Bay. The old-style, pre-warp sleeper ship contains the bodies in stasis of Khan Noonian Singh, a genetically engineered strongman and one of the great leaders of Earth's Eugenics War. Although disappearing without a trace then, Kahn soon reveals the ambition, strength and that conquered a quarter of the Earth -- and Kirk is forced to depend for survival on the dictator's new lover, the adoring ship's historian and seeming traitor to the crew."
4,The top ten of Star Trek: Space Seed is the number 2,"Um dos melhores episódios da série classica, em que a presena de Ricardo Montalban acrescenta ao e presena de espírito, contribuindo para que este episódio esteja entre os mais lembrados da série e que contribuiu para sua sequncia no cinema, com o filme ""Star Trek The Wrath of Khan"" END"
3,Well...,"Maggie's friends think that Tyler is awesome but she isn't sure. Then at a party at her house, she and Tyler meet. After that Maggie and Tyler seem to have a relationship. The book was romantic. It was sweet but I think Martin is heading again to the babysitters club. At first I thought it would be as real as the others. As I read, I could feel it kinda geting... different. but it was a good book altogether."
4,They Just Keep On Getting Better and Better,"If you like love , heart brake and reading about best friend then Maggie diary three is the book for you ."
5,Sweet,"This book was really sweet. Maggie's awesome, and I was glad to see her kickin' the anorexia. This book was great, Tyler was cool (Maggie's most definitely getting over her dislike of movie stars, particularly towards the end :)- it was very cute). The only thing I disliked was the cover, but I guess Maggie's looking straight aheads towards life! Read it, it's a keeper. All of Maggie's books are. Glad to see they're all getting themselves on track, particularly Sunny. Maybe even Ducky, too."
4,Great little meter,"This is tiny, shirt pocket is no problem. It does all the general things I need. Decent sized leads, could maybe be shorter. Display is easy to read even at awkward angles. It could use a clip or a holders for the leads to help keep it in readable position when you can't lay it flat and see the display. Easily overlooked when it doesn't take up any room when in the tool bag and is always handy."
3,great power...short life,"I am a framing carpenter and need a good, long lasting saw. This saw has great power, sturdy construction, but i've only had it a year and it already doesn't work. I pull the trigger, but nothing. I haven't been rough on it. I'm hoping it's just the brushes, bt still...only one year? I have much less expensive Skill saw that was nearly ten years old before the brushes needed replacement. Can't say that i am extremely pleased with this saw."
5,Cool Cd with funny good music.,This is a really cool cds and some really funny songs and if you like loud punk and profanity this is a cd for you.
5,Guttermouth's Very Best,This has to be one of my favorite CDs of all time. Every song on it is great and entertaining. This is a must have for any fan of Guttermouth or any kind of punk rock. Buy this CD!
5,Guttermouth is the best punk group in the world,"This cd is realy cool, this is the best cd of guttermouth. This cd is also very funny and the songs have a great melody. Thank you guttermouth for that album"
1,guttermouth can't get any worse,"This CD is what you get when you mix a bunch of no talent fools with a record label that is known for putting out rotten records. Musical Monkey tries to deliver both humor and the sounds of hardcore punk but acheves neither. The cd tries to capture the well known antics of the band shows but it fails here as well. If you are a fan of so called ""humor punk"" stick to bands like NOFX and The Vandels."
5,Village,"Despite the fact that Warner Bros. decided early on to put Wallace Roney into an artistic strait jacket to cater to some corporate fantasy about what jazz is, Roney was still able to manage a noteworthy album. The last half of this recording (songs 5-9) epitomize the inventiveness of this art form and of Wallace Roney himself. There is a seamless quality to songs 5-9 which many listeners will appreciate. I'm not knocking songs 1-4. In fact, I enjoyed the band's rendition of Joe Henderson's ""Inner Urge"" with Brecker blowing fierce lines during his solo and I also appreciated the juxtaposition of a certain part of ""Paraphernalia"" on the standard ""I Love You."" Don't sleep on the first half of the album by any means (it's hard to complain when Chick Corea and Pharoah Sanders make an appearance), but it's clear (at least to me) that the album Roney wanted to make was the last half of Village in which the album title is deeply embedded in the music."
1,Not a sturdy product,"Instructions call for hand wash only, which I did. Colors still bleed and the bag is fraying along the zipper. Not good, especially for the price."
5,Great bag,I carry this bag with me when I travel (keeps me out of the hotel sheets). Packs up small and is very comfortable to sleep in. I will definitely consider the Slumberjack brand for future purchases.
3,Sequel Not As Good As Original,"""Shoebag Returns"" is the sequel to ""Shoebag"". Although the sequel is a fun read, it is not as good as the original. The original was mainly about Shoebag and his hilarious cockroach family.The sequel pushes Shoebag aside, making him a side character, which I didn't like. A new boy is the main character, but he does not possess the power to go from human to roach, and from roach to human.The sequel moves too much like the author is speeding thru the story, rather than telling it, and let it flow smoothly as she did in the first one.There are no fun spider characters for Shoebag and his family to be fearful of, although there is a tarantula character that has a good, small part in the story.I was upset that Shoebag's family was removed from the sequel too soon. As the pages got thinner, I realized they were not returning. That was a shame.The book leaves the door wide open for a third book, but as of January 2012, I'm unaware of another."
4,Surprisingly good,"I generally don't like Christian music, simply because most of it is cheesy. Dime Store Prophets, though, has surprisingly intelligent lyrics, and I dig the Southern Rock sound. There are a couple cheesy tracks on the CD, but I think the purpose behind them was fun, and not to deliver a serious message, so it's okay.The best songs on the album are the title track, Boxing Shadows, and Suckers Alchemy.Oh, and one more reason I like the album, it's got a sullen feel to it, which is unique in Christian music. It's not the happy-go-lucky attitude that most bands try to convey."
5,Great for a table-mounted router!,"Perfect for fine adjustments while your router is mounted on a router table. When you remove the router motor to use it in the plunge base, you'll have to remove the adjustment knob, but it's a very easy press fit and removal. When your using it in the table to make fine adjustments, once you've got the height you want, be sure to lock the router or it will drift.As is always the case with Amazon, it arrived prommply and in perfect condition."
5,Lots of fun!!!!!!,I got the land air R/C for my birthday and its a great R/C!! The jeep goes super fast and then you launch the plane and the remote changes from jeep to plane. I would definitely recommend for anyone who likes r/c planes.
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"This was a huge disappointment. Not only is the plane very flimsy, but it doesn't fly well at all. The so-called radio control doesn't control a thing on the plane, and the range for the truck is marginal at best. The real kicker is the [$$$] battery pack you have to buy to run the truck and charge the battery on the plane. They tell you that you need a battery, but not that it's an extra [$$$] added onto an already way too expensive toy."
5,Very relevant for current times,"A must read for anyone interested in the creation evolution debate or scientific education in general. This is the most informative and well-written book on the current manifestation of the creation evolution controversy that I have read. Dr Shanks has written a book that not only addresses the concept of Intelligent Design but that makes points applicable to the creation evolution debate in general. Shanks debunks the arguments from Anthropic coincidences, irreducible complexity, entropy and others areas. He contrasts the arguments creationist's make with those that have come down from the Enlightenment. My favorite chapter was the last one where Shanks fully exposes the wedge strategy of the creationists. Those concerned about policy-making in the US will also appreciate this book."
2,Has it come to this? Let the hair pulling commence...,"Here, Shanks has very thoroughly designed nothing more than another self-indulgent attack on Christianity and Intelligent Design. Evolutionary theorists should be as appalled by his emotional and often childish idioms throughout as the ID defenders for whom he shows no respect. I have studied at length the arguments of creation science and watched as theoretical holes and the widening gap between opponents fills with bickering. While I will not make specific recommendations, I will suggest you seek out the few calm objective critiques that are available."
3,"God, the devill...a library book.",I won't order books from these folks ( a library) again. They were not conscientious about getting it out to me quickly..I wasn't sure I'd get it at all! The book was what I expected.
3,Be VERY clear about what you are buying.,The picture on the front of this DVD is of the artist playing an African Djembe. I have one of these and was looking forward to learning more about tuning and playing the drum. However this gentleman is basically a CONGA player from the CONGO. If you don't read the description carefully you won't notice this. He spends the first nine lessons playing on Matador congas. If you don't have TWO congas you won't learn much. Only at lesson 11 (11 out of 14) does he switch to the Djembe and at that point he just plays different patterns in each of the lessons without saying anything about tuning the drum. He is I'm sure a very accomplished muscian and if you would like to play African patterns on the CONGA you might enjoy this DVD but don't let the cover fool you. There isn't much here for Djembe players.
5,Awesome for men,Bought this for my husband a while back & it is now his signature fragrance. It would make any man smell attractive! it's that good! :)
5,Oh My God!,My boyfriend wears this. He just happened to go to the mall and pick this out. He has never worn it before. OH MY! It smells so good I can hardly stop smelling it when he puts it on. Its so refreshing.I wish it came in a womens scent. You wont be disappointed fella's and ladies get this for him! Well actually it will be for YOU!
3,Mancala for Four,"Silly Me. I thought the game involved the use of the mathematical concept of square roots, therefore being a greater challenge to developing minds. Duh, that is the name of the company! But, still for a family of 7, a game that includes four is a good thing. The board is sturdy and worth the money."
3,good for 4 players but not the same challenge as the traditional two player game,I was happy to see Mancala offered for four players. That would fix the problem of people being left out of the game or having the wait. It does address that issue but we found that does not produce the same type of challenge that the traditional two player game offers. The game moves quicker with individual moves having a greater impact on the course of the game. This means that the third and fourth player may not have opportunity to implement a meaningful strategy because they are subject to the moves of the players before them. It's still a worthy game but we'll need to play it more to see if we can get more out of it.
4,Great quality Game,Got this for my kids 9 and who play it on Poptropica. They noticed it in an educational toys magazine. I like that it is for four players. Quality is nice. Kids played it and enjoyed it. I have not played it yet. Happy with the quality.
1,"One Question ""What the HELL was that all about""?","Having been a VanHalen fan for years I was intrigued when the new album came out. After listening to it once, I promptly gave it to my worst enemy, who also hated it (GRIN)..... Eddie's meaningless meandering on the fret board combined with Cherone's limp vocals make it the worst album ever conceived by the band. The only saving grace for this album is that it bumps Diver Down up a notch."
5,Excellent bread pan,"Loved the first one so much that I purchased a second. Solid, well-made...only had ever purchased Lodge in the past because of the inferior quality of other brands I had encountered but have been pleasantly surprised."
4,very good product,"i'm very happy with this pan. nice even heat distribution, good browning, nice loft to the finished bread. I seasoned it pretty well and loaves pop right out. I'd give it five stars if it were a little easier to maintain but you should expect that with cast iron I suppose."
3,don't be fooled by size,"This appears to be a really good quality cast iron loaf pan. However, I was looking for a bigger size and didn't realize that the length quoted in the product description INCLUDED THE HANDLES. So, this comes out to be your standard size for baking items like banana bread etc. I needed something larger to bake whole wheat bread loaves in."
2,This pan stinks (literally),"I've used this loaf pan 3 times to make yeast bread. It has a funny, unpleasant smell which transfers to my bread so the bread ends up smelling and tasting strange. I hoped this would resolve over time, but it hasn't. It bakes ok, but I'm returning it due to the smell."
2,Sante' Should Never Have Sold Out,"I purchased 2 of the Sante' Cast Iron Bread Pans a couple years ago. And I cannot imagine ever going back to anything made out of any other type of material for baking my bread. I kept an open mind enough to purchase this third pan, now made by a company that has, apparently, taken over Sante'. And I'm sad. The inferior materials and manufacturing is obvious. The pan is even smaller than the Sante' pans."
3,Great Pan - Description Misleading,"I was searching for a regular size loaf pan, one that would give me a loaf around 12 inches long. I love cast iron and thought this would be the perfect pan. But, upon receiving was very dissapointed that they included the handles in the product dimension. The loaf size in only 9 inches, but when you add the handles it becomes 11 inches so this product is being returned."
3,"Ok, would go with another brand","Not totally thrilled with the bread pan. It's ok, but I would rather have lodge brand. Def not ready to use out of the box."
5,WOW!!!,I bought this product based on the reviews as well as the idea that it's a forever purchase. I couldn't be happier. I just started baking bread last week and made my first banana bread using this pan. The crust was perfect and the bread was a big hit at my Dad's birthday party. Buy this product now! DO NOT FOOL AROUND!!!
2,"good, but disappointed","I bought 5 of these in 2009. Very happy with them. Needed one more so bought it in February 2012. The site said it was the same one I had ordered previously. BUT, it is not. The older ones weigh 4 pounds and say on the bottom: Cabin Kitchen CIBP9. The new one weighs 3.5 pounds and says on the bottom: Camp Chef Home. The new one is the exact same size and design, just thinner and lighter. It is still a good pan, but my problem is it makes a difference in the way the bread bakes. The new one is over-done when the old ones are just right. I would really like to get one more of the older model to match my others. If you have one for sale, please let me know. Dean Wall"
2,Pan is rusting,"I've only used the bread pan 3 times and its already rusting and leaving stains on my bread. I need one more bread pan, but I won't be purchasing this pan again. If anyone has suggestions, please leave a comment."
1,Made In China,"If ""made in China"" were written anywhere on this Amazon item description, I would have known not to buy it. Lesser brands sold at Kohl's are also made in China. If you want to see what poorly constructed cast iron is, go there.First off, who knows what ill-health causing chemicals it's made with. Second, it's way lighter than good quality cast iron is supposed to be.For those of us who know and appreciate good quality cast iron, we know better than to buy any made in a third world country. Their citizens are hard working people who only do and produce what they're told, but 99% of the time, third world quality = crapola. This cast iron bread pan is no exception.Bottom line, if you know quality, you'll know this is not it. Don't waste your time. I'm returning mine right now."
3,Authentic without barbed wire,"The sound and interpretation here are a far cry from the old solemn full-orchestra versions from before 1970, and luckily also a far cry from the booming and grinding ""authentic"" sounds of the 1980s. This is authentic with smooth sound and no barbed wire in your ears. I enjoyed the earlier symphonies more than in the Marriner set (Philips) but in the later works, moving into the realm of history's greatest symphonies, I tend to long for the old-timers, my favourite here, Karl Böhm. In the present set, the Allegro of the great g minor is like a ride in a speedboat, hardly touching the waves; the Andante, you're in a rowing boat, ducks gently bobbing on the water, a foretaste of Beethovens's Pastoral; the Menuet, a very serious conference at Animal Farm. I recommend Böhm in 40 and 41, Marriner (on Decca, not Philips!) in the wonderful 25 and 29, Jochum (Concertgebouw) in 36 and 38."
1,Pure Trash,"Complete junk. The motor stopped long before we had ice cream and the plastic gears slipped when I tried to use the hand crank. Between the price of a bag of ice and the cost of the ingredients, I poured $8 down the drain and put the ""Aroma"" back in the box. I will return it tomorrow and retrieve my $50. I would not keep it for $5. If you like this thing, it can only be your lack of experience with a real ice cream maker."
2,Meh,"The poles aren't bad. I prefer the cork grip to the typical hard plastic on most XC ski poles.These are very lightweight and feel good during extended tours.That said, I snapped one of them in half the fourth time I used it. I had the carbon version of the pole and they are obviously not as durable as the aluminum version that Karhu makes.I also had a problem with baskets coming off the first time out with them. Thankfully, I was leading the group and someone behind me alerted me to the problem. I really just needed to twist them down as tight as I could and I never had a problem with the baskets again.I've been forced to go to a cheap Swix model for the time being, but I hope to go with the aluminum version of this pole and pray for better durability."
5,Great Song!,"When I first got the single and put it in the CD player, I was a little hesitant. The beat was not what I was used to. But,I listened to it over and over again (until my mom yelled at me to turn it off!) I really liked the song. Especially the spanish version. I think Kaci has a strong voice when singing in spanish. She should start doing more things in the USA. People would love her."
5,It was awesome!,"I saw the music video of this on the Disney channel. when i went to look for it in a music store, they said they didn't have it! I looked every where and finaly found it here. I definatly recomend this song!"
5,Emergency Medicine Procedures Book,I received the book within 3 days. In New Condition. Great job done by the seller to expedite before Christmas! I would definitely buy from them again. Thank you KJ
5,Good service,I received my book quickly and experienced no problems. I would recommend to buy from this seller
3,All round writer,"Used it for one course. Enjoyed while discussing in class, but I don't think I will read it all by myself again."
3,Son didn't like it as well as the other ones,"Bought this for my 23 month old son, he loves mighty machines...but for some reason this DVD didn't hold his interest..."
2,too mellow for my 2 1/2 yr old,"My 2 1/2 yr old grandson was going on a cross country car trip and I though this would show him some of the things he'd see along the way. he has a car DVD player so I thought he could watch it while driving. He was totally bored with the DVD and walked away after only a few minutes. It is a very mellow tape, perhaps he is used to something a little more loud and active. Anyways, a dud for us."
2,This ring scratches your fingers,I could not keep the ring because the golden part of it scratched my two adjacent fingers.
5,Works great,This product works wonders on my dogs very dry skin. The garlic smell made them want more. Easy to use and give to dogs
5,THIS STUFF SEEMS TO WORK,OUR 12 YEAR OLD BLACK LAB HAD TERRIBLE DRY SKIN PROBLEMS ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO. WE GIVE HIM TWO TABLE SPOONS OF THE SKIN & COAT SUPPLEMENT MIXED IN HIS FOOD EVERY MORNING. SEEMS TO ALEVIATE HIS CONSTANT SCRATCHING AND THE WHITE FLAKES ON HIS SKIN AND BLACK FUR HAVE DIMINISHED. NICE SHINY FUR NOW.
2,Good if you can wait for it.,"I ordered mine July 25, and still waiting. Received an email from Bench Dog to explain the problem. ""The problem lies solely with us. Our ProMax table production line has been dormant, due to severe shortages of parts and raw material and partly related to parts that did not meet our stringent quality standards. However, recently I received very encouraging news from the production folks, indicating our lines will be up and running at nearly normal levels by the first week in October. Shipments should resume the second or third week of October. Amazon has some great deals on our products and the shipping terms are hard to beat. Rest assured they will be among the first to receive our backordered items as they become available. We apologize for the production delays of this very popular tool!""So I will wait and use a shop-made table until then."
5,"thank you, bench dog!","this is the only router table i'll ever need. well built, pretty easy to install and precise. great space saver for a small shop like mine. you can't go wrong with this!"
5,great tool for me...,"hi, i got this table about 2 monthes ago. i orginally attached it to my rigid table saw but realized it would work even better for me if i built it into a table of its own. i did and i bought the bench dog pro lift too. i am no expert but i can tell you that this combination has improved my ability with the router tremendously. i highly recomend not only this table but the lift also, the combination has allowed me to turn out work that i never thought possiable for me at a fraction of the time and waste i had before this purchase. i also want to say that both the table and the lift were very easy to set up and i was able to start working instantly. it may seem a bit expensive but i honestly think it is well worth the money."
5,A Great Bench Dog Product,"I first installed this table on an old modified Craftsman table saw with a Porter Cable 7518 router and a Woodpecker lift. The first thing I noticed was the nice extra surface area. Installation was very easily and an extra set of hands was appreciated for this is a pretty heavy table. My first project was cherry raised panels for a blanket chest. The project went smoothly. The table was solid along with its sturdy, durable fence. The fence is also easily adjustable and removable. I have used the table on quite a few projects since with some added Bench Dog accessories (Panel-Loc and Feather-Loc). It never failed to give me excellent results."
1,Don't buy this saw !,"I have owned Skil wormdrives for 20 years. I purchased this saw as an upgrade for my Skil Mag77's. I returned it the next day. The motor sounded worse than my 15 year old skil, and I did not like the plastic handle on the blade gaurd. I admit it, I use a wedge under the metal blade gaurd , to hold it up for special cuts. This is not possible with the plastic handle. I am now back with my trusty and superior Mag 77's."
5,I love this saw,"I have used skill saws since the eighties, this has the best balance and weight. It is worth the extra money, nice saw."
4,exactly what you would expect,This saw is the same as the other bosch saws. heavy duty cast foot. I am glad it doesn't have the stupid chord plug in handle. If you have one chord and need to use 3 tools that thing is a huge hassle. I hope the engineers realize this and stop putting it on these saws.mine showed up without the saw hook which was a bummer. That thing is nice for hanging on a joist or saw horse. the chrome is neat but I got them because they were cheap.
1,gloppy,"I bought this because of other reviews of 4 and 5, but this stuff leaves little red clumps on my face, it is like it is partially congealed or something. Maybe I got a bad one."
4,Product review,Well the shipping was excellent! I got it 4 days after I placed my order cant complain on that. As well as the product goes it really doesn't have an affect I wish it were more like a blush but it seems to blend into the skin and become unnoticeable. I like the product though and you get what you pay for
3,Kind of Thick Application but Works Alright,"I was really concerned when I first tried to pump the gel out and it wouldn't come after a full minute of pumping. I opened up the top and saw that the inside was a thick gel rather than a liquid like I expected. I could understand why it wasn't pumping out!Finally, I got some out. It came out as a gel rather than a liquid but I was able to blend it. It took a 2-3 applications to get the desired color (this is for ""Cheeky Cherry;"" I have a light complexion with freckles). So I think/hope this will work well enough despite my initial doubt when it wouldn't pump."
2,I think I'll just pinch myself...,"I found the consistency of the product to be a bit tricky to spread properly. After application, I found it had a blotchy effect. Perhaps it is not meant for my skin type and tone? I'm happy I tried it out, but would not vouch for it to work for everyone."
5,Great for your Xbox 360!,I purchased the Zalman Ram heatsinks to lower the ram temp of my xbox 360. Before this installation my ram temp was at 160F and after my temperature dropped to about 132F. That was a significant drop in temperature. These ram heatsinks are definitely worth every dollar! I also got them very fast! Thanks!
2,Wish they were stickier,"I tried to use these on my video card ram, as I removed the ram sinks/fan assembly when I water cooled my system. I had to get additional thermal tape to make these stay on, as the video ram sinks point down (as most do). If they were stickier they would be great."
3,"good design, poor material choice","Two of these attachments were included in my router purchase and as far as dust collection is concerned, they work great. Unfortunately, the fixed base attachment (top right in photo) has cracked and broken in two. Because its constructed of acrylic and has a severe right angle, the slightest stress from your hose can snap it off. I understand that the material should allow for visibility but with a broken attachment my visibility is now hindered by a lot of chips. Even that didn't bother me too much until I found a $40 price tag attached to the replacement cost. Really?"
4,Works as well as it can,"The price is too high for this item, but basically you're paying for Bosch advertising there. The product does do a decent job of capturing dust, but enough still escapes that prevents me from giving this a 5 star. If you are not able to find anything else, this set does do a decent job and is WAY better than using no dust extraction."
5,Dust Control,This item was mounted on a Bosch Plunge Router and connected to a shop dust vac. Works great to control saw dust. If you move your router at a slower rate it makes it dust free. Arrived in excellant condition because of proper packaging. I would recommed this product to my friends.
1,worthless,"not worth the money I spent, I had to modify it for it to work at all. Does not fit , hard to install, flimsy."
4,My lungs thank me.,This is a must for any user of this router. I can do my work without wearing a dust mask thanks to the addition of these dust collectors. No more vacuuming up the dust. Now I can have the area clean while I work.As far as build quality the product does the job and comes with all you need to attach it to the base.
3,Picard must stop a Federation starship from starting a war!,"In this episode we see the Cardassians for the first time. Worf describes them as having no honor, but when Picard learns that a renegade Federation ship is attacking Cardassians, he must prevent the ship's captain from starting a war, but will he succeed?"
3,Good book but written with a grudge,"I enjoyed reading this book and anyone who reads it will learn much about the inner workings of our national security community. There is much insight into the Clinton years and Clarke's respect for him is obvious. It is also obvious that Clarke has little respect for Bush and his administration and basically characterizes them as ignorant, illogical and fanatical right wingers. It is an interesting book and I did enjoy reading it but it is clear that Clarke had an ax to grind and this is not a ""fair and balanced"" account of the Bush administration's handling of unprecedented calamity. I suggest reading ""Bush at War"" by Woodward for that."
2,Biased and cynical hindsight that ultimately bores,"We've all worked with this person: the guy where everyone he works with is an idiot, he's the only competent one in the office, and all they had to do was ask him - he knew the answers, but they wouldn't listen.Unfortunately, that's the tenor of this entire book. I'll leave the enumeration of the inaccuracies to others, as it was the bias, hindsight and cynicism that ultimately ruined it for me.Let you think I'm one of those people that labels everything I disagree with as biased, I found the Congressional 9/11 report to be both more compelling and informative while simultaneously being more balanced. I'm sure the pro-Clinton, anti-Bush crowd will feast on the vindictive morsels contained in the book, but if you're looking for something that doesn't do all of the thinking for you, look elsewhere.I'm glad he wrote this, I just wish he'd had a better editor or taken a few more years off to cool down and reflect before he wrote it."
4,I enjoy reading this book,I enjoy reading this book. I think this book is good for the people who want to know and understand the recent situation. And I recommened this book those who want to know and understand the real situaion.
2,"If you can't form your own opinion, don't read.","This book is an unfortunate display of bitterness that has already had a negative impact on our country. I'm not sure how Mr. Clarke can put that much blame for 9/11 on a predident who was in office for months and so little on the previous president who was in office for years. Obviously written to hurt The Bush Administration, not to get the facts out. Scary to think this guy was an important figure in the war on terror."
4,Revealing Facts,"This was very controversial book during 9/11 commission process. Because, Mr. Clarke gives inside view of the Clinton Administration counterterrorist works and compares with the first 6 months of the Bush administration. Because, he resigned from Bush administration. Even you will find war on terror in past 25 years in low density. His writings show us that Clinton done far better job than public thinks. Because, public opinion was shaped under 9/11 patriotic climate, Bush hawkish behavior and his lies. It is also possible to see Osama Bn-Ladin's organization background and his improvement during the time. But the most important feature of this book is that you will see the blind determination of Bush administration on Iraq policy regardless of the facts.This is the must read book for 9/11 and Iraq war events."
4,A Review of Few Words.,"One word. Credible.Two words. Overwhelmingly so.9-11 was a crime.The criminals are of course divided into perpetrators and conspirators.The perps are dead.The conspirators are at large.And we're jerking around in Iraq, why, exactly?Read this book and understand one man's view of the process by which that clear mistake happened, and is STILL happening, tothe cost of our children's lives and the filling of BushCorp.'s friends' pockets. That's not partisan (because I'm neither a [donkey] nor an elephant): its in fact the case.Read this book, and anything else you can; our ""media"" doesn't explore nay of this on their own...you must for yourself.This book is one of the best ways to start."
4,Very disturbing,"It really bothers me that the CIA, the FBI and even the White House have information prior to 911 attacks and did nothing. Funny how republicans made a big deal out of how Clinton could have taken out bin Laden but didn't but now that the shoe is on the other foot and the mumbling GWBII is under attack, how offensive they get. Take a look at the syupid 1 star reviews---give me break.Accept the facts and get a life."
5,"THIS IS THE TRUTH, WE SHOULD THANK THIS MAN!","I read the book and I truely believe this man. You can't dismiss this, this is the 5th person in this administration to say the same thing! The attacks on his character are disgusting! Read this book and you too will learn the truth! He is a Republican, not a liberal! Brushing this off as another crazy liberal book is just wrong! I thank Mr. Clarke for letting the American people know the truth!"
3,"My opinion; preview the book first, then buy it","Before buying into the hysteria of the 1 star reviews or the exuberance of the paid five star reviews, why not review (preview) the book yourself at a local BAMM or BORDERS or wherever. Then you decide if you think it's a book worth shelling out $$$ for.I elected not to, my choice. You may feel differently. Just my opinion.Please understand that many of the reviews here, especially the five stars are from the same person. I do not recommend your buying the book based on reviews here at Amazon."
1,Complete Worthless Drival,"I must say, this is the biggest bunch of trash I have ever read. Clarke has donned a red cape and tights and pretends he should have been the savior. He gives Clinton's 8 years a complete pass, and placed the blame squarely on the president. The blame game is very disgusting; clarke is the worst offender thus far."
1,Against all Evil... non-fiction? LOL RIIIIIGHT.,Then guy below me said it all. With recordings of Clinton talking about being handed Bin Laden and not taking him and with recordings of Clark stating how strong the Bush administration was on terror recorder PRIOR to 9-11 and the fact that the Commission asked Clark if he was lying then and he said no... this book is Fiction that should be thrown beside the likes of Tom Clancy. The only people that will like this book are people who dont like the truth. And the truth is out in the open for all to see.
1,What an awful book,"Heres the deal. Richard Clarke is an unemployed loser who is trying to rake in money and he realizes the only way he can do it is by muck raking. Hes mad at the people who fired him, down sized his ""importance"" and distrusted him. It is like George of Seinfeld slipping a ""mickey"" into his bosses drink, the boss that fired him. Clarke needs to jsut sit down and shut up because he is no longer a player in the game."
1,What a Disappointment!,I wish Mr. Clarke would tell us the truth. But I am afraid the allure of money was too much for him.This book seems to be an attempt to rehabilitate the Clinton Admistration and on the way besmirch the names of some devoted public officials.
4,Great book - but irresponsible author,"Clarke wrote an interesting book and its one of my favorite books. But the book is full of ""I told you so""s and he comes across as somewhat bitter. I am somewhat at a lost to determine if his frustration was with the fact that the Bush administration didn't heed his warnings and thus lives were lost, or was he personally bitter for not being listened to or taken seriously. Granted, he did see the writing on the wall and tried to get the Bush administration to listen. But where was his proactive and concerning spirit when the Rwanda genocide took place, and he was largely to blame for the Clinton administrations stand on it?? Yes, if he were listened to 3000 lives may have been saved, but his stand of Rwanda lead to US inaction and could have help to save hundeds of thousands of lives."
1,Clarke=a modern day Judas seeking gold,"It seems appropiate that this book by a modern day Judas has come out right during the Holy Season just before the death of Christ who was betrayed by Judas for a few pieces of Gold. We all know that Judas later hung himself in disgrace.I believe that this time around, it will be the American people who will be hanging Clarke for selling his soul for a few pieces of Gold and get his name on a temporary best seller.Save your money on this book. Wait for the CBS mini series which will have feature John Kerry portrayed by Jim Nabors. Vince McMahon can play Clarke."
1,1 star only because there is no 0 star available,"What a waste by a so-called expert in terrorism. In all the years he was suppose to advise the Commander In Chief he never once prevented an attack. Perhaps this is why he writes this book - to feel better about himself by shifting blame for his incompetence on someone else? President Clinton might have fallen for his ignorance but President Bush did not - and he was dumped. Now, a disgruntled wimp, he acts in desperation with this book. The real sad part of this is that the Democrats use this worthless weasel to try to stab the only administration that is going after terrorists! Save your money - unless you're into reading crap."
1,"lying in 2002 ,or now, you decide!","Funny,that the only way to attack President Bush,is to lie!Are we to believe this account, or the interview Mr. Clarke gave to Jim Angle of Fox News in 2002? I hope for his sake that his latest rants are the truth,because I believe that they were given under oath!Mr. Clarke is the ""poster boy"" for ""disgruntled employee."" He should be ashamed of himself!"
1,Full of Lies,"Richard Clark is a bitter person who is out to get those who forced him out of the position of terrorism czar. The book is full of lies and belongs on the fiction list.For example, he states that Condi Rice did not know anything about al-Qaida. This is false as the Bush Administration discussed terrorism from day one of its term in office.Bush haters will buy this book in great quantities."
1,I'd give it 0 stars if possible,"I find it incredibly offensive that the author blames the Bush administration for failing to act when Bush had only been president for several months. He also does not explain the 8 YEARS of failure by the Clinton administration to deal with bin Lauden.This book is a thinly veiled attempt to influence the 2004 presidential election, and to gain financially from the 9/11 tragedy."
1,Companion Needed,"No sooner does Mr. Clarke release his book when his previous press statements, television appearances, memos and emails get released contradicting statements he is making in his book and his 60 Minutes interview. When he's confronted with this at the 9/11 hearings, he dodges the questions - never addressing his own contradictions. Perhaps someone needs to write a companion book, to sort through all the contradictions."
1,"CNN: ""Clarke...lied under oath."" Typical Democrat!",And look at how many five star reviews support this guy! All the more reason why we need Bush for FOUR MORE YEARS!!!!Liars and adulturers have no place in the White House.
5,A Riveting Account of Inside the White House,"In Richard Clarke's thirty-year career, he served seven presidents and spent two decades fighting terrorism. Therefore, he is well-qualified to write this documented book which reads like a true-crime adventure inside the White House. He reminds us that Clinton actually fired rockets at al Qaeda in Afganistan, while later George W. Bush had no conterterrorism plan prior to 9/11. Clarke takes us down the disturbing path revealing Bush's contrived plan to attack Iraq without credible evidence. If Bush had listened to Clarke, we no doubt would not be in the unwarranted war we have today."
5,"This book supports the truth about 9-11, Iraq and Bush","This book reveals how President Bush and his followers have ignored and manipulated intelligence to acquire the reality they needed in order to justify their secret agenda.While they may not have specific responsibility for terrorist acts,they show complicity by their intentional ignorance.The Bush people know how to play terrorism to their own political advantage; this book shows how it is done."
3,very interesting!!!,"I found the reviews on this book more interesting than the than the book. Many of the 5 star readers were obviously biased but at least most of them apeared to have actually read the book. The 1 star reviewers seem to be non readers like our president.This confirms something my father told me many years ago. "" There is nothing on this earth more pitiful than a poor Replublican""."
4,A Piece Of History That Will Never Outlive Its Value,"How quickly the system of government can break down. Richard Clarke should be considered an American Hero, if not for his faithful service under four Presidents then for his defiance of the unseemly Bush Administration. The President, who is responsible for protecting the nation, did not step forward to assure the victims of 9/11 that he would not let this stand. Instead it was Richard Clarke who had to apollogize to those families and step out of government in order for his voice to be heard. His recollections of that infamous day and his suggestions afterwards are lessons that the entire nation must hear. This book marks a piece of history that will never outlive its value."
5,THE TRUTH HURTS,"Clarke's description of the Bush WhiteHouse is right on target. Now we have Clarke, O'Neil, and Bush himself who admit that The President was more concerned about Iraq than terrorism. Clarke is a reputable, non-partisan figure who wants nothing but the truth to come out. The Truth hurts Bush and his administration since everything they've done has been built on lies. Bush should APOLOGIZE to the nation and RESIGN before he gets blown out in November."
5,He does have an interesting story to tell,"I enjoyed this book so much so that I didn't put it down until I finished. Some of the points he brought up I've read about in various news articles and other books, have helped back up his story. His point about Iraq is a valid one, which only recently became clear to me after coming back home from Iraq, that we turned our attention onto Iraq before even trying to finish the job in Afghanistan.I do recommend this book highly, but if you are a person who thinks that our administration can do no wrong then this book will not change your mind about the mistakes that they have made. I'm not saying you can't change your mind about the administration, I know I definitely have - but that took a trip to Iraq, a single rocket attack at our work center, David Kay not finding any WMDs and a LOT of internet research when I got back home started my questioning why we really went into Iraq."
5,a great but frightening read........,"first off, thank you, mr. clarke for having the b---s and guts to come forth with the truth! it's no secret that our unelected current president, from the very start, vowed revenge against saddam for trying to assinate gw senior! osama was not nearly as important as gw2's passion against saddam, even after 9/11! this s an honest open and candid book in which mr. clarke admits to as much blame as everyone else and apoligizes for those losses on 9/11! no one else has ever done so yet! we have a fool in the white house who can barely speak correct english, and is merely a puppet with his team behind him pulling every string! i'm sorry-i voted for gwb2 and i am also to blame for that error! it will not happen again in november! bravo, mr. clarke! i've now read the book twice, and will do so again..."
5,a real american,"You can only pile lie upon lie for a limited time before it topples. I have not seen this many administration insiders come forward with damaging critiques toward a sitting president ever!Mr. Clarke, a veteran of 4 administrations (3 Republican) has provided desperately needed proof that some of our 'public servants' are truly that, and believe in an ethical standard."
2,The only question is when was he lying?,Richard Clarke is on his way to perjury charges. The only question is was he lying to the Intelligence Committee of Congress or was he lying to the 9/11 commission.
1,Pathetic...Clarke Exploits 9-11 for 1 million dollars,Pathetic...Clarke Exploits 9-11 for 1 million dollars
1,Not worth the trees it killed to print it on.,"Political hacksmanship at its best. The author releases a book on CBS sixty minutes, who is owned by viacom who owns the publisher. It slams the Bush adminstration who is atleast pro active in the war on terror and gives the Clinton administration a pass on a multitude of terroism sins that happened while on the watch of Mr Clarke. It should be pointed out that he taught at the Kennedy shool of Law and is a candidate for a position in the Kerry Adminstration. (...)"
1,"CNN: ""Clarke..lied under oath.""",I was just watching CNN and saw the banner run across the screen about Clarke lying under oath.This scoundrel is worst than Clinton!
1,One star because of author's political agenda,"It is clear to the reader that Richard Clarke feebly attempts to distance himself from the reality that it was his job to counter terror, and he countered nothing. He shows himself to be nothing more than a boot licking lackey of the Democratic machine.It is hard to absorb much from this book trying to wade through Clarke's self-serving agenda."
1,Who's the real enemy here?,Richard Clarke reminds me a lot of Sen. John Kerry in that he flip flops from one opinion to another and tries to lie his way out.Clarke has the right of freedom of speech but to exploit the lost lives that came out of 911 is inexcusable. Perhaps Clarke should write a book called Against All Lies and expose himself for what he really is: a liar trying to profit from a national tradgedy.
1,Work of fiction,"Clarke has been heavily discredited this week as being untruthful. He has conflicts in his testimony and has given opposite accounts of what he has written in his book. He had worked for the Clinton Whitehouse for 8 years of inaction on terrorism. They did nothing in 1993 during the first WTC strike; did nothing when the USS cole was bombed; did nothing when after the US embassy bombing; refused to take Osama Bin Laden when he was offered up by Sudan; gutted the military and the CIA....and he has problems with Bush's first 8 months in office? This is the man who told reporters while he was working in the white house, before he was fired and before 9/11, that Bush's directive was to ""stop swatting at flies"" and go after the terrorists. Now Clarke changes his tune while alligned with the Kerry campaign. This book should be labeled as fiction. It is nothing more than partisan political propaganda."
3,Against Bush,"I do feel that this Clarke may be telling the truth and Bush may be lying. I am a great supporter of Republican party because of their certain policies but I feel that this president is not good enough on anything - security or economy. He just wants to win through deception or otherwise. We should have cornered Osama immediately after the afghan war inside pakistan instead of doing it now. It's too little too late. And this president is too dumb to understand or didn't want to understand that by going after saddam, we have increased the terrorists to atleast double the original numbers. And On economy front, his performance is even more pathetic. Even though I get benifitted by tax cuts but getting me $3000 - 4000 won't make much a difference if to go to Europe or to pay for gas, I have to pay twice of what I use to pay earlier. He thought, he did the right thing with Tax cuts and now is too stubborn to admit, he was wrong."
5,Revelations from a patriot and a brave man,"This book is an eye opener. Clarke is probably the nation's leading expert on fighting terrorism. The book is full of relevant, chilling detail about how America dropped the ball. Naturally the Bush people are attacking it, since they are up for re-election, but the book does Clinton no favors either. Clarke has written a masterpiece. It should be required reading for all college freshmen."
5,Clarke Tells the Truth...and Gets Pummelled for It,"Did the Republican National Committee, Fox News or right-wing talk radio arrange this savaging of Richard Clarke on Amazon's web site?Richard Clarke is to be commended for exposing the mistakes and misdeeds of the Bush administration. America is less safe today than it was before September 11 because Bush and his team decided to divert resources from the war on terrorism to his war on Iraq.The administration and the right wing cannot win on the merits of the policy discussion, so of course you all can't wait to launch the ad hominem attacks on Clarke to divert attention from the real issues. Did any of you even read the book?"
1,A Waste of Money,"Unless you are interested in pure unadulterated fiction written by a self-aggrandizing liar, don't waste your money on this book. Mr. Clarke has shown he is incapable of telling the truth and hopes to make a big profit by fabricating stories. The author spent 8 years in the Clinton White House and did nothing and when he didn't get the promotion he knew he deserved, he turns around and attacks the Bush administration that has from day one done more to fight terrorism than Bill Clinton ever did. Despite what his willing accomplices in the press (Viacom, CBS's parent company, profits from this book) are trying to promote, this book isn't worth the paper it is printed on."
4,Very engrossing,"I bought the book Friday and had read almost all of it by Saturday night. Once I got past the first chapter (that chapter's writing is pretty ragged) I could not put it down. The book provides good information that puts many of the terrorist events we have experienced as a nation in the last 20 some years in a fuller perspective, especially if you have only read about them in the news media. It is not a scholarly work but I found it educational.Clarke has praise for some individuals and thinks poorly of others, as the news media has heavily reported. I think his high level of frustration with both bureaucratic and political inertia led him to write the book."
4,This is a good book but I don't understand the reviews,"I just finished reading this book and I am shocked by what it says but before I will write about that I will talk about the reviews. How many people that write reviews about this book have read it??? It is not a bullitin board for discussions about what is happening in current events ... reviewers, you should talk about the book and not something else.If I go back to the book now, which is reason for concern. I love to read about current events and this is the best summary I know of everything that has to do with Iraq and the war there. It is only one chapter that talks about the Bush administration, but it is very concise and well explained. It explains why the attacks against Mr. Clarke are against him since it would be very hard to attack the facts he presents.Don't forget he is critical of the actions of Clinton and the other pres. Bush as well. Blame is not so easy to assign."
5,Stunning First Chapter,"Reading the first chapter of this book was like reading a Tom Clancy novel; the difference being that Clancy writes fiction and Clarke writes fact. After almost three years, we are now finding out that Clarke was essentially running the country on September 11, 2001. I thought I'd be totally bored by this book; that it would be just another government official telling his story. It's actually quite an amazing read."
3,Let's just assume...,"Just assume: if Clarke is right.. then perhaps David Kay was as well. What does this mean to the Bush administration?Things might not have been, as they had been presented to us all the time..Everybody should read this book and make up his own mind, rather than judging by hear-tell.."
3,suspect,"As a reporter who has covered national security issues, many of the accusations made in the book are indeed accurate. However, many of the problems cited in the book existed many years before the Bush staff took office. Because Clarke served 4 administrations, it would seem he should bear more of the responsibility for the secuirty disasters than he allows in his book. During his tenuretwo world trade center disasters occured, bombing of the USS Cole, the attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania..the list goes on... It therefore makes some of his accusations curious...while the book is an interesting read....its accuracy is disturbingly suspect..wonder if the book is a prelude to a movie?"
1,No shame?,Mr. Clarke seems to have had a memory failure or he is simply delusional. It truly is a shame that Mr. Clarke would sell his soul for a buck.
1,Save your money!!!,"An arrogant, angry liar who did nothing for this country for 8 years under Clinton but now blames Bush for 7 months in 2001.It simply is not credible - changing his story from 2 years ago for the money. AND THEN MR EGOTISTICAL APOLOGIZES. Do NOT buy this book of lies. It now appears he lied before the Congress. He should go to jail for writing this book never mind the lies under sworn testimony......SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Clarke Needs Your Money and Your Forgiveness,"This book is about two things: Clarke's need for money now that he is no longer employed at the White House and his need for forgiveness for the enormous guilt that he feels for having failed the presidents he served. If you want to change the world, don't read this book: it is a waste of time. Send twenty dollars to the Children's Peace Pavillion in Independence, Missouri instead. Listening to the innuendo come diatribe of an angry and remorseful adult will not change the world. Helping children to think about peace will."
1,"CNN: ""Clarke...lied under oath.""",So a liar wrote a book. Does this mean that everything Clarke said is a lie or just some of it? Did Clarke lie only once and if he did should we believe anything else he says because he lied only once or do you doubt everything he says because liars are liars and can't be trusted? Does one liar make a person a perpetual liar or just a solo liar?In anycase at least we know that Clarke is a unqualified liar!
1,Can Clarke go to jail for lying under oath???,"Apparently Clarke's prior association with Bill Clinton has rubbed off....both like to lie under oath. Clinton got away with it, but will Clarke? I hope not."
1,Never let facts get in the way!,Clarke and Kerry both seem to have a problem with their own statements and history. I advise both to figure out who and what they are before going public. It is starting to feel like Clinton all over again...
1,We really need a scale starting with zero on this trash!,How can Mr. Clarke claim that he was the expert and not take the responsibility for being such a failure? Interesting that he waited almost two years before he decided to write his book since it is obvious that he is unable to actually remember what he said before being dismissed. The mistake made by the White House was to keep the people from the last administration.
1,sour grapes,"Yet another tirade by a former disgruntled employee of the White House. Curious how Mr. Clarke's book is at odds with positive public statements about the current administration's handling of the war on terror. He has said that Bush ignored his reports on terror threats and that he knew about the content of the reports but failed to act. Which is it? Portraying Dr. Rice as ill informed on terror groups is pure fantasy. Clarke's advice on terror threats during the Clinton years was unimpressive, as Al Qaeda struck U.S. interests six times during that period. A month after 911 Clarke was demoted to head of ""cyber security"". Was he in the loop -doubtful. Disgruntled? You decide."
1,Is lying now or was he lying in the past?,"In the past he praised the President, Now he slams him. Which is it? Is Clark lying now or was he lying in the past? I find the book to be political rubish clearly seen for what it is."
1,Against all Emenies Richard Clarke,"This book should be in the fiction catagory.I give it no stars. Its a disgrace to write such a bookwhen we are in a time of war.Richard Clarke is just spewing sour grapes. To bad forhim he could of went out on a high note, but looks likea fool or worst now. Shame Shame on Clarke.I'm sure he willpushing his book at the democrat convention later thisyear."
1,Great work of fiction from a 911 profiteer,"We have plenty of Mr Clarke's own testimony and interviews that contradict the assertions in this book.Clarke should be ashamed of profiting from 911 and politicizing the commission. It is one of the most selfish acts ever. It also virtually guarantees that no future President will keep NSC employees from other administrations.If you are looking to blame someone for 911, blame Al Qaeda, not Climton (8 years) or Bush (8 months)."
1,"In Context the ""facts"" are questionable","It would be a dangerous thing for a person reading the book to take the claims of Clarke at face value. While having interacting with Clarke in the past I can attest that he is an intelligent man; however, he also is a man with ambitions that can cloud good judgement.That said, having read the book from cover to cover and followed up by examining public comments made by Rice, Clarke, Bush, and Powell from 1999 to present it seems that the numbers don't add up. Clarke himself critized the Clinton administration for not being ""interested"" in Bin Laiden and his ilk; yet now it seems that he is claiming the same of Bush after of course he lauded Bush's proactive stance on the terrorist issues upon entering the office.As was said during the resent 9/11 commision, Mr. Clarke, your credibility is questionable."
1,Eight years vs eight months,"This book has just been released and already nearly every sentence has been proven to be a lie. Clarke has lied about his work in the Clinton administration, he lied about Condoleeza Rice, and he is laughing all the way to the bank.The only explanation for the media slobber-fest over this book is that the mainstream media is equally dishonest and is only concerned about defeating George Bush."
5,Important reading,"Read to understand what is happening. Well written and direct. All administrations bear some blame. Clinton less than you think. If some of the Al Gore stories were publicized during the election, he could have won. The next election can't happen soon enough. GWB needs to go."
1,NOT what I was expecting,"This item was tiny, absolutely not what I was expecting. I was expecting the dimensions provided, it was about 1/2 that size in reality.Do not recommend to buy."
1,disappointed,"I was so glad to see all the reviews on this coffee pot be negative. I thought I was the only one that wasn't able to make this coffee pot ""work"". I am sorry I bought it and hate to throw it out because it was expensive. Starbucks may make a good latte, but this coffee maker was diappointing. I wonder if whoever made the choice of endorsing this product ever used it."
2,"great design, bad engineering!","I love the design and ordered this machine even though I read all the negative reviews. I set up the brand new, stylish coffee maker and plug it in - no display. Thought the outlet does not work so I try it again. Nothing. Then all over sudden it powers on! No display still, no time blinking as the booklet claims. The power button did not react. It just stayed on. To turn off the machine I had to unplug the cord.Very dissappointing as I really like the looks and am sure the main feature, brewing and all, is great. Did not seem to have a problem with the carafe either. But for the price I expect the electricity to function properly as well. I am returning it and might try the other all stainless option from a different manufacturer. Bummer."
2,not adequate beyond scrap booking,"I love the way the magnet makes the letters pop into the stem, but I needed lettering for light weight .025 sheet aluminum and these stamps were inadequate. The broader, flat letters (think H or K) were not reproducing. While I am new at this, my son is a jeweler and metal smith and he couldn't get them to work either. I guess the people at Michael's were guessing when they said this would work. I is a nicely designed product and the case is very convenient. I am sorry it did not work for me. I don't doubt that the previous reviewer was telling the truth saying it worked well for her. I just needed something with a sharper edge. Happy stamping."
5,MANERVA POP'S OFF THE PAGES,"In reading Tempie's new book, "" Feelings,"" her character Manerva pop's off of the pages. Manerva is a young lady working in a hospital who is caring, loving and shows this in her care of herpatients. The book is very well written and brings forth the characters and Manerva's drive and ambition and yet she is alwaysthere for her friends, family and has great compassion towards her fellow man. I won't give away the plot, you'll have to read this great book from first time author Tempie. I give "" Feelings""five stars *****Author Joseph Frank Baraba"
5,Wow! I'm still drooling,"This book showed me I am not alone in my love for vampires. It's filled with fact and fiction, fantasies and dreams and is going on a special place in my bookcase where I can read it over and over again. A definate keeper."
1,Linguistic Analysis Must Be Dead,"I cannot believe that anyone could take this book seriously. Although I knew the author to be associated with other scholarly works in this vein, I quickly noted that the styles of the various writers and correspondents had major similarities--indicating that these documents were either heavily edited or simply made up. Has no one else noticed this?"
4,"Great ideas, sketchy writing","If you're looking for ideas about how to extend, deepen, or accelerate an existing hiring process, this book is full of excellent ideas. The author clearly has considerably experience and if you follow his advice and pick the techniques that best match you and your organization you'll find the book helpful.However, if you're looking for an introduction to hiring practices or interviewing in general, look elsewhere. The anecdotes are compelling but disconnected--use this as a source book."
3,Fun Book to Read and Learn Techniques,"45 Effective Ways for Hiring Smart! : How to Predict Winners and Losers in the Incredibly Expensive People-Reading Game is extremely interesting. This book is filled with suggestions for finding out about a person before hiring him or her. One example is to do a handwriting analysis.I got this book to help me learn how to hire better. It really clued me in to all the psychological methods that can be used to read the tea leaves. In terms of practicality, a lot of the methods weren't useful. Some require too much time or expense. Others require personality assessments that might not seem appropriate. I don't think I can ask somebody to take the Briggs Myers personality test as part of the candidate selection process. A lot of this is for CEO positions where the candidate has most likely been chosen in advance but such methods formalize and legitimize the occasion."
5,"Intelligent, creative, effective and up to date!","As an HR specialist, I found Dr. Mornell's advice to be extremely beneficial to the recruiting process. After reading his book, I implemeted his ideas on interviewing and reference checking. Specifically, as someone who tends to talk too much, I took Dr. Mornell's advice and created a list of written questions to ask candidates during the interview. The candidates had a chance to review the questions and respond, thus encouraging my silence and strengthening my listening skills. I also utilized his refernce checking advice (calling people at lunch time etc) which was clever and effective. I have already passed Dr. Mornell's book onto several co-workers and friends who have also raved about it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"
5,Do not hire without this book,"Besides the great production values, the book simply has the best advice of anything in print about the crucial nuances of hiring."
2,"Not One of Your Better Golden Books - a review of ""The Little Fawn""","This is not one of your better Golden Books. First, fawns show no expression, and the pictures are just not enough to make up for this deficit. (We should be cooing. These are baby deer for goodness sake.) What you get is picture after picture of a fawn laying down in the grass; looking this way, then that way.The story is not much either. Mom leaves the baby and the baby sleeps, sees a bunny, then gets up and wanders off where the fawn sees an older fawn. The little fawn can't keep up with the bigger 'cousin' so he is left behind. The little guys then goes up to the top of his mountain, looks around, goes home and then goes to sleep. <yawn>Two Stars. If your child likes pictures of deer they might like this book. There is virtually nothing to learn about deer here. The pictures are uninspired, and there is no plot action. It's not horrible, but I would be remiss if I suggested purchasing this book."
2,Not the best,The content is effective only if your opponent is someone you've played against many times. For the Internet player there are so many different styles that this book is virtually useless. If there is one thing I can say good about this book it would be that there were some interesting stories about former chess champions.
4,Roman Law and Common Law: two separate system?,"The book offer a clear image of the beginning of Common Law. I believe it is a very useful tool to understand the situazion England has developped her own system of law.Leges Henrici Primi, edited with translation and commentary by L.J. Downer."
4,Lifehouse Still Strong,"No Name Face wowed the world with the hit Hanging By A Moment, the solemnity of Simon, and the heart-melter Breathing. Stanley Climbfall was a slight disappointment for Lifehouse fans. However, Lifehouse's self-titled CD blew us away again. The choruses are great and the verses poetic. Lifehouse is still strong even in their 3rd CD."
3,Which song is which?,"Lifehouse made a big name for themselves in the late 90s with their album, No Name Face.I actually wasn't even aware they released a second one. The third one was released recently at my record store, and I decided to pick it up.The vocals are nice, the guitar is nice...but overall this disc is a little boring. The tracks, whether played as numbered or randomly, run into eachother creating a musical blur that is somewhat mind-numbing and a little sleep-inducing.I cannot name specific songs which jump out at me, either. Perhaps if I listened to them solitarily, they might have a greater impact but all I can think of right now is taking a nice big nap until another CD comes on."
4,Great Listening,"Look, I have listened to all three Lifehouse albums. The first one is a lot edgier than the third, which doesn't mean this one lacks in substance. I will tell you, honestly, the first 5 songs of the album are pure gold, and make you forget the mistakes they make in the other songs on the album after that. The best song on this CD is without a doubt, Better Luck Next Time. This song is a lot more edgier than the first four and has some great arrangements.Lifehouse have really made a stride from their first album, where they sounded a lot like Pearl Jam (maybe Jason Wade's voice has a bit to do with that). But I think this is the CD where the group really finds itself... this is the kind of music they should be playing. The CD is superbly produced. Worth your money and time!"
3,Forgettable,"Someone has to tell it like this is. The way I see it is No Name Face was Lifehouse's best cd, Stanley Climbfall was a pretty bad follow up, Spin and Take Me Away really were the hits on that cd. This new cd kind of sounds like what Stanley Climbfall should have been, but regardless it is not that good. This cd is full of forgettable slow songs one after another. There is a reason that You and Me is the single on the radio right now, because its the best sounding slow song on there. Other songs that stand out on the cd are Days Go By, Undone, and We'll Never Know. This cd is a mediocre release, good thing I listened to it for free before buying it. All you new Lifehouse listeners pick up No Name Face instead."
1,Could they whine any more? Hardly....,"Just when I thought the current fascination with whining, whimpering and just plain 'ol annoying drivel--oops, I mean music-- was ending I get to hear this. One word comes to mind: Yuck. Well, OK, four words come to mind: Shut the ____ up!I simply cannot fathom how this group has a following, much less a record contract. One droning, dreary and completely non-melodic whine-fest after another, culminating with the incredibly insipid and way overplayed ""You and Me"". Even the lyrics are annoying: ""What day is it and in what month...."". What is the singer, an idiot? In a stupor? Both, unfortunately, would fit.If you like the whinings of John Mayer or Rob Thomas you'll like this. If, however, you like real music that raises the pulse, or at least your spirits, look elsewhere."
5,WOW!!!!!!,"I own every Lifehouse album and I have to say that they just keep getting better and better. I bought the new album before I heard a single song, that is how much faith i have in this group."
5,evolution of the band,"to be honest, when i first put the cd in, i was expecting something similar to what lifehouse has put out in the past. i was surprised and pleased to hear a new sound from such a great band. they've begn to push their limits, and jason wade's vocals have become something to marvel. the band, as a whole, has grown through their music, and it's works like this album that keep me buying their records."
4,Lifehouse,"I'm with Amanda. The songs are good (Wade writes awesome lyrics) but I missed the rock 'tude of the previous cds. ""You'll Never Know"" & ""You & Me"" are great tunes and I've added them to my playlist."
5,Lifehouse Rocks!!,"These is a great CD, all the song are great, like all cds of lifehouse you will find the same quality, the feeling, the great lyrics, all the songs are great... Lifehouse rocks!!!"
4,Refreshingly Familiar,"After a sophomore release that was strikingly different from their debut album, Lifehouse has returned to their roots. Even though all the songs on the album sound fresh and new, it's nice to hear the group get back to what made them successful: simple yet haunting lyrics backed by solid musicianship. I have been waiting a long time for this album, and it definitely met my expectations. ""Days Go By"" definitely sounds better this time around with a heavier sound than it had on the Tad Hamilton soundtrack. ""Chapter One"" shows a strong Beatles influence without losing its originality. ""You and Me"" sounds much better on the disc than it did as a streaming audio file on the band's website. Every song has its own sound but still contributes to the synergy of the whole album."
3,Evolution or mainstreaming?,"OK- so ""they turned down the amps and left the Creed comparisons behind"". Now they've become the ""smoothest ride in alternative"".Yeah, well not every change is for the best. I would call it ""generic alternative"" which defeats the purpose of alternative doesn't it?I was disapointed. Turn the amps back up, forget smooth. I suggest that Lifehouse find the fire and passion that characterized their first two albums."
3,"good, but not their best","I'm a great fan of Jason Wade and his beautiful voice and this album is definitely good, but I was hoping for more. Stanley Climbfall and No name face was more catchy and amazing song after song. This third official album maybe needed further work on it, so I gave it three stars."
5,Very Cool,"I think that the new Lifehouse CD is great. I like how it has a more mellow tone this time around, but we can still relate to the Lifehouse style we've come to know and love. It's the perfect album to pop in your car and just drive to or just to chill out to. Great work!"
5,Awesome comeback!,The wait for the new album was well worth it. Lifehouse has come back strong with a great album. Now I can't wait for the tour!
5,Awesome group,Very seldom do we get a group of guys that come together and make good music like this. I've listened to all of the songs on this cd and I must admit I like them all...
5,Great record!,"It's a very very good Lifehouse record, such a great follow up to the second one. I still listen to it a lot. Having the real CD is important to me, in this digital era where everything is virtual. Thanks Amazon!"
5,awesome,It has the best melodies and the lyrics are awesome as well. His voice is also a little higher in this album because the songs are in a higher key. There is more acoustic guitar in this album too. It is just awesome.
3,"No ""Stanley Climbfall"" but a good album nonetheless...","At first listen, I thought their single ""You and Me"" was by far the best track on their latest album, but after a couple more listens, I realized that they saved the best for last...or should I say the best four for last. ""We'll Never Know"", ""Walking Away"", ""Chapter One"", and ""the End Has Only Begun"" are all very memorable tracks and some of my favorites on their latest offering; and the rest aren't too shabby either. Though the album as a whole does not live up to ""No Name Face"" or ""Stanley Climbfall"", it's still not a bad effort and belongs in your collection if enjoyed those albums."
4,Keep Wading,"Things change. Wade hasn't much.Getting smoother and quieter never means getting weaker or worse or changing too much. The songwriting skills have been kept carefully and used smartfully on the recent cd. It clearly shows with almost every song off his third album.Lyrics keep shining even though at times may lack the originality, but instruments and vocals are both of the same old Lifehouse style, and it works pretty well.The true beauty of the album is built by Come Back Down, You And Me, Blind, Better Luck Next Time, Into The Sun, and Walking Away. The rest is a nice addition that decorates the whole thing efficiently enough.Nothing at the moment can compare to No Name Face, but they keep trying."
4,You and Me,"I'm giving this album 4 stars and not 5 because I don't think that I've truly listened to the album throughly enough. I've had ""You and me"" on repeat. Its basically about loving someone and only them, even though there's millions of other people out there. Its like, they're say that no matter what other girl I come by or see, my eyes and heart will only be on you.Now, I'm back editing my reveiw, because I have listened to the whole album, and I must say it is one of the best CD's in my collection. My favorite song is ""Into the Sun"", while I also love ""Blind""."
4,Love it,"This is not the best album from Lifehouse. Their debut album is by far more superior than this one. Even ""Stanley Climbfall"" is better. But I still think this album is good (maybe because I am a fan and bias). I listen to it several times/day. The songs are good but there's a nagging feeling that they sounds a little like the others. The lyrics are not as powerful as the songs in ""No Name Face"". Again (as with the other albums), the best song in the album is not the one that gets played on the radio all the time. So, for that reason along, go out and get this album!!!"
4,Lifehouse,"I heard Lifehouse on the radio a few weeks back and couldn't get the song out of my head. Finally, I decided to buy the cd. Turned out to be a great decision. Good listen."
2,nothing special,With the exception of the first song (the best and most memorable song on the album )there was nothing that stood out on this album. After the first couple of songs they all seem to just blend in together and your left with nothing that really stands out in your head. Mostly all filler in my book. That is what happens when you have most of the songs done by one writer in the band. It tends to become one dimensional. I have seen and heard better unsigned bands in local clubs than the wasted music this band has been putting out. Unfortunatly my Wife likes them and I have to struggle through a whole show of watching this bland stuff for 2 hours tonight!!!! At least there is a bar there that will make things more interesting.
3,May Cause Drowsiness,"No, seriously. I think each of the songs may be great if played individually, but listen to a series of them at once and you're lost. The album is a tad bit boring and slow for rock.In general, the music just are not catchy enough. I'm no musician, so I can't explain in technical terms why, but I know that I've listened to this CD at least seven times in a row and, very surprisingly, I only remember maybe three of the songs.I've heard that the lyrics are great, and while I think this band does come up with more sophisticated than the typical I-love-you-why-did-you-go oh-oh-oh I've heard oh so very often, their ability with words does not make up what they lack musically. In any case, this is just not for me."
4,Where is the savings?,"The price for this router table online is the same price at Lowes. But It says you save 150 bucks. My question is, where exactly are we saving 150 bucks buying it online?"
1,what a joke,"For less than the cost of this unit I built a nice solid table with all kinds of features that are either unavailable, expensive or under built in the store bought models. Any router how to book will walk you through it. If you're truly a woodworker or aspiring to be one & not just a collector of power tools, this is an opportunity to improve your skills & make something worth having that will last a long long time."
2,Has Design Problems,"Mounting plate sags causing serious loss of accuracy. My solution was to get a 3/8 aluminum plate and discard the plastic one supplied. I think the sag got worse over time from having the router hanging from it.Second change was to cut away most of the flat panel under the table, to the right of the switch. This seriously limits access to the router while changing bits and making adjustments. Can't understand why this hasn't been changed after two years on the market.This could be a pretty good product with a few design changes."
4,A well built router table.,"I purchased the table for my Bosch 1617 router and found it to be very easy to assemble and solidly built out of quality material. The manual is clearly written with precise and easy to follow instructions. All of the parts fit together very well and securely.I would have give this product 5 stars except for the following reasons:1. Even though it was easy to assemble, there were way too many parts. Couldn't some of this have been pre-assembled?2. To remove the router one has to first remove the fence, then unscrew the mounting plate from the bench, and then unscrew the router from the mounting plate. I expect a little bit more from the ingenious Swiss engineers. One cam latch in the proper place would do the trick.3. The power switch should be able to control two plug in outlets: one for the router and one for the dust vac. This would enable one to turn both on at the same time."
2,Disappointed,The Bosch RA1180 is my first router table and I must say I am very disappointed with it. I agree with another reviewer about the fence being a nightmare when trying to change bits. I ended up making my own fence and using clamps. I also have a major problem when sitting the bit depth with my Porter-Cable router. If I had to do it all over again I would just make my own table.
1,"In response to ""Its the same as the Craftsman""","If this Bosch table is indeed the same as the Craftsman..Avoid it..The setup, although it did take some time, wasn't all that bad.. (Maybe because I expected it to be difficult from reading previous reviews.. lol)My so-called ""Professional"" Craftsman Router Table which also sells for $249.99 is high on the ends and low in the middle of the table.. And although $250 isn't a huge amount of money.. You would think for largely a hunk of plastic and some aluminum you would get something far more ""precision""...Craftsman is NOT an alternate to the Bosch table.."
4,Router tables are great things,"Ordered this table and got to me just fine. However it did take a bit of time to assemble. The good side of that is now I know how everything goes together if it should break someday. Some that reviewed this item found the bit hard to change, My guess is they are incompitent. I have had no trouble with any of the operations or features with this product. Either myself or one of my crew use the table once or twice a week. My advice, buy the tool that works right the first time, this is one of them."
3,Looks Good but...,The table looks good but....1. The top is not deep enough2. The metal top mars wood3. The left fence sticks out a hair snagging the work pieceBut the price is right for an all in one table
3,Great product except for one fatal flaw,"I bought one of these and liked it a lot, except for one flaw: the router mount plate, which is made of some kind of plastic, flexes. For operations where the workpiece is supported by the aluminum table, this isn't a problem, but I was making sliding dovetail joints. One piece was supported by the table, but the other piece only 'rode' on the mount plate. This resulted in ~1/16"" difference between the two cuts.I contacted Bosch, who were very up-front and said that they did see some deflection in the plate and recommended that if this was a problem I return the table and buy a non-flexing product. I'm still trying to decide between Veritas and Benchdog, leaning toward the Benchdog."
1,The Look Will Fool You,"This table is a very attractive unit set up to give you the impression you are purchasing a useful and productive product. Unfortunately after you have purchased the table and assembled it as I have, reality sets in. Concern #1 is when you get to page 18 of the manual you are told that the mounting plate will not accept any router except a Bosch. This of course was not the information I received from the Bosch representative at the Colorado Woodworkers show in Denver. Even more surprising when you contact the local bosch representative to acquire the Bosch RA1185 Mounting Plate. It is very expensive. Suggestion from the distributor in Colorado Springs is to drill your own holes in the mounting plate. #2) Do not expect to make any adjustments to the mounting plate without undoing the fence completely and removing it from the router table. This is a major undertaking."
3,Good Intoduction to Communication,"This book breaks down the fundamentals of communication in detail to describe all aspects of verbal and non-verbal communication. You'll be surprised to realize the little things about communication we all take for granted. I especially enjoyed the chapter describing what brings people closer and separates them in interpersonal relationships. A few of the chapters did seem quite boring and unimportant though. I feel the idea of this book is to discover how we view ourselves in society and the perception we gain through the people we meet and are associated with. Also, this book will give you a better understanding of how to interpret people through their use of verbal and non-verbal communication."
3,The book for my Inco 101 class,My prof and his wife are the authors of the book. It's actually one of the few text books that I have enjoyed to read. I'm not sure if I would recommend it for pleasure reading though.
5,Great CD,"WOw I am surprised only three people reviewed this cd after the sucess of Coco Jamboo hitting #21 on the Billboard charts, as most dance hits do not make it that high. Anyway the songs on this album are not like Coco Jamboo, they are faster and more Euroish. SO if you like groups like 2 Unlimited, Twenty-4-seven, and Real McCoy then this CD is for you."
3,take it in the spirit in which it is given,"This book outlines an attitude toward gardening: grow things that you like and that are suited to your area. It sometimes has an odd perception of what counts as a 20 minute project. For example, digging a two foot (!) deep bed, enriching the soil, and planting rose cuttings is takes more than 20 minutes, no matter how much amphetamines you take. But they are right to assert that gardening should be fun, anyone can garden, and we should grow things that, well, GROW. BTW, I disagree with the reviewer who thinks that taking a cutting from an abandoned plant is stealing. Digging up the plant is stealing. Taking a cutting is propogation, not at all harmful to the parent plant. I read a lot of techinical garden books. I found this book a pleasant change of pace, like a chat about gardening."
4,A refreshingly reasonable take on gardening,"I found this a fun, quick read with a refreshing attitude toward gardening. For those of us who enjoy the beauty of gardens; but despair of ever finding enough time to manage one with minimal help, this book offers hope for a reasonable way to do both. ""Serious"" gardeners may find it insulting. The rest of us may find the book helps us to let go of the ""guilt"" of not spending every free hour making a perfect garden which we have no time to enjoy."
4,LIGHT-HEARTED GARDENING BOOK,"This book was fun to read, and had some good ideas for those of us who like to garden, but don't always have as much time as we'd like to devote to it."
1,More a lame comedy book than a gardening source,"I found this book incredibly irritating. Instead of the concise guide to yard work the title suggests, it is full of endless riffing by the two would-be comic authors. It might be cute for their relatives, but... the rest of us must keep looking. It has a few good ideas, but so what?"
1,an insulting book,"This book is an insult to gardeners and everyone else. It also promotes theft; one of the authors takes rose cuttings from a cemetery. Instead of wasting 20 minutes browsing this book, invest the time finding out if the authors can be put in jail for their admitted criminal acts. By the way, insulting readers with garbage like this should also constitute a criminal act."
2,Not very effective,"Had a small dent in my new car and thought this might pop it out. While it did help some, it did not completely remove the dent."
3,Lacks strength,"Works...well, sort of. Sounds crazy, but this is great for pulling larger dents (rather than small ones) back out. Not enough suction for really small dents."
4,A little less suction that I expect...,"I can fix a problem in my car, but I try to use it on the car of my friends and sometimes work, somtimes doesn't work... I little more suction maybe will be needed. But the price and the item is no bad... I recomend this item for little problems, for example doors hitten in the middle with a soft form."
3,The suction is nice,"I bought this on a wimp. After receiving it, i still don't know what it's for until i need something to hold the car's window while i work on the motor. This one turned out to be perfect for that job. The suction is strong and it takes some strength to pull it off the window. I only gave it 3 stars because the lack of instruction. I only received the puller, nothing else. It will be nice to know the application for such item."
1,Not a worker.,"Honestly, I bought this for a small push-in on my highlander - not a creased dent, not a rough surface or anything. This suction cup barely even held onto a perfectly smooth metal surface. I can't even get ti stick to a metal door to get it out of the way. It's quite lame"
1,It's cheap!,"I had a dent from where someone backed into my rear fender when I was parked that I wanted to pull out. Unfortunately, this product could not generate suction due to the shape of the dent. I tried wetting it etc, but unless the suction cup can cover a flat surface it would not work. It was a rather large dent, so I was surprised that it would not seal properly. You are probably better off 'hammering' from the backside to pop the dent back out (if you can get access)."
1,Dent puller - Not! You're better off using your pucker.,"When I ordered it, I was skeptical that I could get something that could pull a small dent out for the price of this item. I should have listened to my gut. This item is made of cheap plastic and literally has no suction power/ability at all, no matter if you use it with a little water to try and make it stick or not. It looks and works like a toy.Needless to say, it didn't work at all on the small dent I have on my car."
4,Great Starter Kit,"This is the perfect tool kit for younger folks..i bought this to keep in my truck and have tools at hand always..i love it & would recommend it to anyone..only flaw i have with it, the case isn't that great..the pliers don't really pop in the case like i would want, but hey everything else is just fine"
4,Tool kit for amateurs,Fast shipping-disappointed that one tool does not fit space--throws off all shutting of kit. Tools ok not high quality.
3,I needed a back up tool kit,I needed a back up tool kit for the other building for when a problem is found it saves coming all the way back to the shop. The tool selection was just right all the tools we generally need for repairs.The annoying part of the kit is that the tools don't fit into the case they all fall out of the top cover some don't even fit into the space they are designed to fit into.
3,Average Tools - Lousy Case,"You'd be hard pressed to find this assortment of tools at this price. The tool quality is average but will be perfectly fine for light duty, occassional handyman tasks. Unfortunately, the case is of very poor quality and many of the tools are either too loose or too tight in their holders. That's a disqualifying negative for a set of kit like this that most people will carry to the job site in the holder.Every time opened this case there were tools everywhere. The wrenches were especially bad about falling out. On the other hand, some of the fixtures are so tight you'll have to use one of the other tools to pry it out and a hammer to get it back in. So, unless you intend to put the tools in another tool box or bag, you should look elsewhere. I gave it three stars purely because of the value pricing of the tools. I need a kit that holds the tools firmly in place but lets me get them out by hand. I'll be returning this item."
2,Poor quality box,"Just got it today. Amazon did an amazing job of shipping quickly even on free shipping rate.The tool itself is okay. But the box is really cheap. one of the tool doesn't even fit in the slot that it is supposed to go into. When i first open it, almost all the tools on one side fall out. The plastic feel and smells cheap too. It reads ""made in China"" everywhere..."
5,Satisfied,I bought the product recently and i was very satisfied by it. All the parts are in the box and in good condition. The only problem is that there is no additional space to put extra tools. Other than that i am happy with the mechanic tool kit.
4,"Pimped-out, Psychedelic Retro Spy Grooves","Serving up the 60s w/a hit of ganja. Funky, chilled & cooler-than-thou.A bit monotonous, to be sure. Perfect background music to set the evening mood.I dare you to play these tracks & not find at least one person who asks, ""Who is this?"""
4,THIS IS ERASURE not DEPECHE MODE,"Sorry Animorphgirl, !'am 31 not 17 so I think I know a little more about both DEPECHE MODE & ERASURE. Vince is doing what Vince does best...that is making great music, not being a bitchie queen as implied....."
3,Nothing New Here...,"I was actually a bit disappointed with this album as it lacked the originality of their other recent efforts. This is definitely a return to their original style, and while it's still great, I feel it was done more effectively before. The singles ""Rain"" and ""Don't Say..."" are my favorite songs on the disc, but after that it all kind of runs together until the bonus track ""Rapture"", which is a great oddity and a fun song. Overall, I prefer Erasure's two more adventurous previous albums."
1,Erasure has run out of ideas and inspiration,The music on this album is very bland with no stand out songs that's why it bombed on the charts. Erasure needs to update their sound and put some energy and passion into the songs otherwise they should retire.
1,INCREDIBLY BORING AND BLAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS THE DULLEST MOST FORGETTABLE THING THEY HAVE EVER DONE. NOT WORTH WASTING YOUR MONEY ON. THEY NEED TO GIVE UP. THEY HAVEN'T DONE A DECENT ALBUM SINCE I SAY I SAY I SAY. THEIR TIME HAS PAST. ANDY BELL JUST CAN'T SING.
4,"New, different but good...","I am an Erasure freak but I reallly didn't like this CD the first few times I listened to it. But after spending time with it and having cool experiences with it, it was sweet! I love it!!"
3,The Pieces Don't Come Together,"Erasure has all the parts to make an ideal pop band - songwriting chops and musicianship in Vince Clarke, and an excellent singer in Andy Bell. These pieces, however, don't gel as well as they should here on COWBOY. While Erasure's lyrics rarely are confused for poetry, they seem rather more trite than usual here (especially on ""Reach Out"" and ""Boy""). The music is all right, but there aren't enough hook-laden songs here to keep me really interested. Andy Bell's singing is fine, but rarely reaches that sublime level that can elevate substandard material. The choice of covers at the end of the album are bizarre, but give them credit for pulling off Burt Bacharach's ""Magic Moments"" and almost pulling off Blondie's ""Rapture"" (they lost me in the rap section). A few tracks here (notably ""In My Arms"") show what happens when they get it all right, but it doesn't happen often enough for me."
4,This is my last review... Actually my first,"Hey all. It's the real anigirl. Sorry bout the last reviews. That was my younger sister playing a joke on me. I'm 22 and I love Erasure and DM, dm's my favorite, and I'm really mad at her. I did tell her about the comparence between the titles of the songs, but I wasn't serious. Now she took it seriously and wrote the reviews. I recieved a message from someone else who saw my review and decided to tell you guys. He also said that this was probably their worst album, and I sort of agree. I really like I say 3x, and he mentioned that Vince may have been running low on inspiration and did this. I really like Erasure, but it isn't their best album, so I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5."
4,Destin to be a collectors item,This CD captures the characters of the original television series. Memories of a television program that has become a modern cult classic go with each song and track.
5,A man and his router,"If your a serious woodworker like I am, or an occasional do it your-selfer you must appreciate the qualities of a goodrouter. I've owned and used many different brands, butfor the price and the quality you can't go wrong with a Bocsh. If you want ease of operation, easy adjustments, great control and one of the best templet guides available. TWO THUMBS UP get a Bocsh!"
1,I kept waiting for redemption that was never to come.,"Groovy! Psychedelic! Post-modern! And a total consumeristic ploy to teach the children of the early 1970s that Christmas is when you get stuff.I kept waiting for a Linus VanPelt moment, where Ted E. Bear would be taught about the birth of the Messiah and his promise of redemption. Instead he meets a hippie Santa Claus who tells him that the meaning of Christmas ""comes from inside you!""Why Ted E. Bear, didn't you know that you can be your own personal Jesus. Can you dig it, Daddio?Add to this the astrology-spouting, all-knowing voice of reason secretary at the Organic Honey Co, and you've got a perfect opportunity to teach your kids about new age theology while fueling consumerism and greed EVERY holiday season.Maybe it's a good thing this stinker is so hard to find in production."
3,"Nice, fuzzy an sentimental","Ok. This forgotten Christmas special features the voices of Tommy Smothers and Barbara Feldon as two bears in a mythical bear world, and it's Tommy's character who longs to find out about this so-called ""Christmas"" that he heard about once. The problem is all bears fall into hibernation in this bear world, and can never really find out what this strange ""Christmas"" is.Not a bad seasonal special from the early seventies that deserves to find additional life on DVD. Especially since it's no longer telecast regularly, and hasn't shown up on the cable channels recently.It may not be in the same league as the Grinch or Charlie Brown, but it definitely deserves to get a second chance.Nice. Warm. Fuzzy.Sincerely,JThreecarolyn@dia.net"
4,An old Christmas Story,This is one of my favorite cartoon Christmas story that I have not seen in many years. It's a story of a bear trying to find Christmas by not hibernating like the other bears. Very good movie for the children
2,Not very detailed...,"I bought this book expecting to find a history of the fortifications around the San Francisco area, and I guess I got that, from a social perspective. The book is short, lacks detailed maps, is short on maps in general, and focusses far too much on individual personalities and banal human interest tidbits.Nowhere in this work is there a comprehensive listing of positions, weapons, or locations, which is what it desperately needs.I cannot ecommend this book to anyone interested in visiting the coast fortification sites."
4,Great for 4 and 5 year olds,"Our 4 1/2 year old is at that stage where she can handle a bit more complexity than the average video, and the Horseland series fits the bill well. And the stories have great morales that I hear her repeating afterwards. Try this one, and if they like it, buy the whole set; they're cheap used on Amazon."
5,NOT just for Seniors,"As a technical support representative for a local Internet Service Provider I found myself recommending this book to customers of ALL ages. This book does something I haven't found in any other book--it starts at the beginning in easy to read and understand language and takes the reader through to ""cyberspace."" This is not a small undertaking. Everyone to whom I recommended this book has thanked me because it gave them an understanding of computers and software that they could actually put to everyday use.I now recommend this book to employees of the hospital where I am the projects coordinator. I've had the same rave reveiws from them."
4,Great book - BUT ...............,"Young@Heart - Computing for Seniors is an excellent book for anybody who needs to know every little itty bitty detail, in order to really get started with computers. All other books that I have read have frustrating gaps that leave one not knowing how to get from A to B; not so with this book.Everything imaginable is covered, leaving no mystery unturned.My only two gripes are what I consider to be quite important though.First of all the title does not encourage other age groups to consider this book, and that is a big mistake. This book is about the best I've come across, and it shouldn't be assumed by the authors that the rest of us simply don't need it; we DO.Another really sad drawback about this book is that it was originally published in 1996, and I can't understand why it hasn't been updated since then.Please, Ms. Furlong and Mr. Lipson, can you do something about this????????"
4,Amazing Twist...or Chignon,"Yes, the title is silly and for that reason alone I avoided watching it. For months. And then I finally did sit down and watch it and I really, really liked it. If you're expecting a ""jump out at you"" type of horror film, then don't even bother try watching. It's simply not that kind of movie. I wouldn't even necessarily categorize it as ""horror"" but more ""supernatural drama/thriller"". And yes a wig crawls across the floor in one scene. So what? Is that any cheesier than a couple videotaping themselves sleeping in order to find out if they have a ghost problem? The acting is good, the special effects are few and the twist in the story is worth watching it for. It totally took me by surprise."
5,Love it!,"The mane does look a little different than it does in the picture, but overall, this lion stuffed animal is really cute. Very soft and cuddly! =)"
4,Multiple Choice,As an adult I thought it was ok. I bought it as a gift for a teenager so until she reads it I can't really comment too much.
1,Multiple Choice; a boring horrible book,"I was made to read this book in school, and I was plainly disgustedwith it. I give it a -100 out of 10. It was just about some little girl's problems and how she listens and worships (blasphemous!) a few little wooden pieces. YAWN! I can't believe I actually made it through to the end. (If it wasn't a grade, I wouldn't even bother) I pupously read fast so I could hurry up and finish it! I recommend this book to people who love reading horrible books and who enjoy being bored out of their mind!P.S.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
3,The Art of Exotic Dancing Male Exotic Dancing,Overall very interesting with an artist who was very proffessional in his approach to his art. Perhaps a few basic lessons given by him could have added to the enjoyment.Sincerely Terry
2,male exotic dancing,"It is probably not a bad informational if you are looking into becoming a stripper, however if you are looking for dance moves or ideas for your woman or women it is almost completely devoid of such tips, and no real technique for clothes removal either, so again unless you want to learn about the industry and get some basic tips on becoming a stripper don't get this dvd"
5,"Man, he's the _hit!","OK, this DVD is more on him and what he has to say about dancing, tips, shows, etc. Very cool angle, have not seen this and I have seen a lot. And of course, he's hot and you get to see how Hot if you know what I mean!"
4,Save your lungs and cleanup time,This little collector works great if you have a powerful dustcollector or shop vac. A very nice addition to your router if you use it a lot and spend hours cleaning up afterwords. It also gets a lot more of the fine dust at the source before its air borne.
5,It's dreamy!,"It's hard to find a selector with so many inputs. I have my PS2, Xbox, N64, Game Cube, SNES, Genesis and NES hooked up to it. It gets the job done!"
1,birth control is still the woman's problem,"I bought this book for my teenage sons wanting reassurance that they knew all they should about birth control. Look up birth control in the index and you'll find no entry. Look up pregnancy and again, nothing. In the chapter on sex, choosing the most comfortable condom is covered, but nothing about correct usage to avoid pregnancy and nothing about other methods of birth control, not so much as a mention. This book perpetuates the myth that pregnancy, birth control, and children are things only women have to worry about. This is a major, inexcusable oversight."
4,Ahh yeah I remember this.. the TEASER TO THE MOVIE!,ok so yeah the movie started being shown in promos on TV I was obsessed with MK 1 and 2 on my SUPER NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM oh yeah and then WAL-MART had this 8 dollar video cassette that promised a MK cartoon and behind the scenes footage of the new MK movieand it had it..pretty groovy stuff the computer generated fight sequences with KUNG LAO and GORO were cooland the cartoon was pretty cool but man it was such a TEASE I wanted so much more whcih I eventually got in the movie..I wish they had put the stuff from this VHS into the DVD of the first MK moviebut I own it so it's all cool!
3,Good but not great as the real live movie Mortal Kombat,"Mortal Kombat The Journey Begins is pretty good but it did not have characters like Kano and Reptile. But it was a good movie. Some of the movie is not also showing 2D but 3D! The main problem was that it never finished the story. They did not even show Liu Kang fighting Shang Tsung! Or Sonya Vs. Kano! And they did not show Johnny Cage against Goro! But one goodthing was when you wait for the credits to be done, You will see behind the scene footage of Mortal Kombat The Movie! Try it!"
1,"This is an animated movie, not the real one","Hi, these other reviews are of a live action movie called ""Mortal Kombat."" This listing is for an animated movie about the same characters. Don't be fooled (as I was)."
2,Not my thing but oh well,This movie is animated and doesn't have the actors. Its ok but it doesn't stack up to the original live action film.
2,havent read not on kindle,I would love to read more of Alan Dean fosters books but 1 Iam in australia and they are either not available or not on kindle GREAT shame
1,Annoying,"The functions work about as well as similar calcs. No problem there. But even on a flat, hard surface the thing rocks slightly, causing a bumping every time I punch a key. No big deal? I have to place it on a mouse pad or pad of paper to use it extensively. More often than not. I'll use the calc. on my computer if I don't need the feet/inches functions. If I hadn't foolishly thrown the original packaging away, I would have returned it to Amazon"
4,Metric Calculator,This is a good calculator for metric conversion. The only thing I wish was available was micro m/L and kilo m/L. Am very happy with product.
5,Liked it.,This worked great for what I was doing. The price was very good for the calculator. A great construction calc.
2,"Got the job done, but not done well","My son hated this sling for the first 6 months of his life. Then he began to love it! The problem with the sling is that it is too big. Untill I tried on a friends that fit, did I realize how much by back hurt because of the ill fit.I bought the medium based on my height. My baby sleeps in this sling at my waist. I could never get it higher because of the padding. When my son sits on my hip, I can't adjust the top ""bar"" tighter because the padding is already at the buckle.It got the job done, I used it for a while, and then bought one that fits.I have heard from several women that they had similar experiences."
3,"too bulky for me, baby only liked one position ...","I bought this when my baby girl was 5 months old and weighed 16lbs, 27 inches. She only liked sitting in it for a short time. She didn't like not being able to kick her feet and arms. We have the baby Bjorn which she loves. I thought the sling would be better for her to fall asleep in. I watched the video 6 times and practiced putting it on and off. I had to pause the video and rewind several times. It is bulky on the shoulder for me and I felt it was too tight to cradle the baby. Her head was smooshed and she was uncomfortable laying down. (...) Maybe if I started using it when she was smaller? The sling from JJ cole looks more modren and not so bulky although I never tried it. I would have if the store carried it. I have given up on the sling thing."
2,Disappointed to say the least,"I registered for a sling to be more discreet while breastfeeding in public. I registered for this sling because it is the only one Babies R Us carried. After 7 weeks of trying to use this I took it back. My daughter screamed hysterically every time I put her in it. I watched the instruction video three times thinking I was doing something wrong. I gave it 2 stars because it does look like you could use it with an older baby better.Even in the video it does not make breastfeeding more discreet it just makes allows you not to hold the baby (again shown with an older baby). I returned this and bought a soft carrier. Although it does not allow for breastfeeding, she absolutely loves it and it is very easy to use, with a lot less material than this. Save time and try a different sling or carrier!"
1,Not What it's cracked up to be,"I bought the sling in hopes of bonding more with my newborn son and to calm him in his fussy moments. Well, unless your a larger size person, this is not the sling for you! I am only 5ft 3in with a small frame and even on the tighthest setting, the sling is simply too big for me and my son to be comfortable. Also, it was simply too big for him even though he was born at almost 9 lbs. The material is not soft, nor soothing and it's just a very awkward design. Definitely not worth the money."
1,"Sorry, Dr. Sears, I hated your sling!","I'm a huge fan of Dr. Sears and his books on parenting/breastfeeding. Unfortunately, I hated his NoJo Sling! I'm 5'7"" and fairly athletic (former professional dancer) yet this sling was very uncomfortable. Even after researching several websites on babywearing and discovering that I had the rings positioned too low, I still could not carry my 9 pound son for more than a few minutes without pain in my lower back. (Not to mention across my c-section incision.) It was also difficult to put my baby in the sling without help from someone else.My son HATED the sling, but loves his Snuggli carrier.The NoJo Sling would be great for discreet public breastfeeding... but a blanket is cheaper and easier to carry!"
1,didn't work for me,"I bought a nojo while I was pregnant because I wanted to be able to breastfeed in it and use it rightaway after our baby was born. I tried when he was 2 days old and I had so many problems with it, because it was just too big and had too much padding in the way. I'm pretty average size--5'4"", 150 lbs. Also the video was not helpful. I got a baby bjorn instead (which doesn't allow breastfeeding) and my baby hated being upright, plus it made him spit up alot in that position. So, I went back to the sling idea and read some reviews here and ordered from babymoon slings. Definitely a better fit since the padding is so small I can get it really tight around baby and me. Now that I've figured out how to use a sling and my baby is 3 months I've tried the Nojo again, it's just not comfortable or attractive--I don't get why its so popular or why dr. sears doesn't make it better, it seems it really wouldn't be that hard to improve upon."
1,don't waste your money,"This carrier is so uncomfortable. It's huge and bulky and my baby screamed the whole time. I didn't like the padding near her face it was very overwhelming. The fabric is cheap, too, probably wouldn't last too many washings, --since it is only 30 bucks I guess you get what you pay for. I sent it back as fast as I could."
2,Beware if you are short!,"I was so excited to get one of these since so many of my freinds had gotten one. I quickly discovered that this item was not for me. I am 5' 2"" and the sling was shortened as far as I could get it. The baby was down around my crotch and is head was lower than the [...]. I don't know what I was doing wrong but could'nt get it to work no matter how I tried. Later decided to buy the much more expensive Baby Bjorn and was so happy. Not only did it fit me in comfort but held my baby's fat legs also (which the evenflo and snugli ones did not...I ended up trying several models before breaking down and buying the Bjorn)"
2,Way to big for newborns,the pading completely covered the baby and she screamed oncei put her in. It never was comfortable. good for bigger babies
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,My son seems so content when he is in the sling. And it is so much easier on my back! This is a must-have in my book!
3,Only good for a sleeping baby,"Most of the time, when my daughter was awake she seemed very squished in this sling. A few times I was able to lay her down in it and let her sleep but for the most part she seemed uncomfortable. She is six months now and I hope I can get some more use out of it for when I need to carry her on my hip but overall I think I could have lived without it."
4,Pretty typical sling,"I haven't used this as much as I would have liked. I can't seem to get my babies comfortable in it. It is a very breathable material, but there is a ""pillow"" that doesn't seem to be very functional and almost gets in the way. Otherwise it seems to work pretty much as a typical sling."
5,Miracle for my baby,If you are a new mom - order this now! I takes a few days to get used to but once you get comfortable it is a miracle. My baby fusses I put her right in like the picture shows and walk around or do stuff around the house and she is out like a light. The padding on the edge is nice for the baby's head and the shoulder pad works as a pillow for small infants. Give it a try you and your baby will be happy you did!
1,Too bulky and difficult to use,"I received this sling as a shower gift. At first, I was excited about using it and watched the instructional DVD. Even with the instructions, I found this sling to be difficult to use. My husband even tried to figure it out without much success. The sling is too bulky and has too much padding. My one month old found it to be very uncomfortable and screamed every time I tried to pt her in it. I did not feel that the sling fabric was sturdy enough and still found myself using both hands to hold her the couple of times I used it. I wish I saved the packaging as I would return it in a minute!"
5,great for newborn or colicky baby,"this was one of the few ways my daughter would calm down and go to sleep, the closeness of mommy, and the way it kept her in the fetal position, and she could still see what was going on around her. saves your arms to do other things, more bulky than a snugli baby carrier, but totally different in comforting baby. i havent used the other more expensive ones, but this one worked great and was easily adjusted for size."
2,Too Long & Bulky,"I have to begin by admitting that I didn't watch the instructional video that came with the sling. I did read the instructions, however, and never really got comfortable with using this. I am 5'1"" and I pulled the strap as tight as it would allow. My baby was hanging too far down! There is so much material and padding that the sling totally enveloped my newborn and he couldn't see out, which he hated! Maybe it will work better when he gets bigger and we can do the side hip position."
5,Best way to carry your baby,"I recieved one with my son when he was an infant and found it so much better than those back breaking, hard to put on packs. This thing just slips over my head and I slip baby in it. It is even easy to pass the baby off to someone else, like Daddy by just slipping out of it and over Daddy's head. I found it wonderful that this one carrier allowed my son to be in different positions: laying, sitting up, facing mommy, facing out. I even found that especially when wearing a nursing shirt I could nurse him while in the sling in public and noone was the wiser. Nothing was revealed. Made grociery shopping alot easier. I was still able to use it and a larger one when my son turned 2 to carry him when he was feeling insecure."
3,It was an okay sling...,"The Nojo was my first sling. I used it for quite a while until I found other slings (Maya wrap). I find it bulky and it is hard to carry around when not in use. I like something I can stick into a diaper bag for use when I need it. You can not do this with this one. I did not find it comfortable after my baby got to be about 18lbs...then it started to hurt my shoulder..even with the padding. My baby did love it though. ANd it did enter me into the world of slings..but if you like something easy to carry, then this isnt the one for you."
5,worth every penny!,This sling was just perferct for us! Our little guy went to sleep every time we put him in!
2,ill fitting sling,"Save your money and find another sling. This sling has numerous problems:1. too much padding and if you are short (I'm 5'2"") then your baby hangs too low b/c the padding is in the way2. the shoulder pad is annoying3. can't adjust the sling once it's on4. the material is scratchy and feels cheap"
2,it's ok,"I originally bought the Snugli & have been using it for a few weeks, but it was hard to get my newborn in & out of, so I bought this sling. Looks comfortable & is at first, but is a killer on the back & shoulders! My 7 week old loves it, but it does not feel secure to me at all. And if it's hurting right now at 11lbs., I can't imagine it later. I watched the video, but the thing is so confusing to use. (Not the most attractive thing either.) I'll be returning for the Baby Bjorn or SmartRider!"
1,Granny,"I purchased this item for my first grandchild, however I am 5 ft. and I could not manage to adjust for my height. My grandson was almost at my knees. I ended up returning the item."
1,Two children - could never use,"I was so excited about getting this. I watched the instructional video several times. The only thing I could figure out was that it's made for someone who's 5'6"" and 120 lbs. I know someone said their 6'4"" husband could use it, so maybe he was thin, too. I'm 6' tall and weigh 250 lbs. I could never get it so it didn't just swallow the baby up or mash the child against me. When my daughter was about 5 or 6 months old, I used it with some limited success (mostly sitting down)."
5,Love it!,"I love this sling! I also used the New Native sling, and while my daughter likes both slings, this one is more comfortable for me to wear. The padding is great for my back and shoulder and for my baby's head to lay on. It is easily adjustable so that I can carry her high enough to easily sit down without her spilling out (and so I can go to the bathroom)! My daughter hates to be put down so this sling is a lifesaver. I'm wearing her as I type this! Whenever she fusses or won't sleep, I pop her in the sling and within 5 minutes she is happy and is off to dream land within 30 minutes. My only complaint is that I can't get her out of the sling without waking her up, so I have to slide out of the sling and tuck the sling out of her way as best as I can. I couldn't get by without this sling!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT,"I used this product for my daughter. When she was five months old I was walking across the room with her and one of the plastic rings snapped. Luckily I caught her in time, but if I had not had my hand on the back of the sling she could have crashed to the floor.I tried to contact the company to warn them and was ultimately put in contact with Dr. Sears. His secretary asked me to send the defective product to them, which I did, but never heard a thing. They are still selling the exact product. BEWARE!! I used to swear by this product but will be going with a different brand with metal rings."
3,A good idea for breastfeeding moms...,"My son loved being in this sling and I found it easy and comfortable to use. But he ""outgrew"" it by 3 1/2 months. Once he was interested in looking around at other things and not just me all the time, we outgrew the need for it. I'm sure it will come in handy once he is about 6 months old and I can use it as a hip holder, but right now it has taken a backseat to the front carrier.It was really wonderful for me for breastfeeding though. I found that as a newborn, I could put him in this sling and go Christmas shopping while he nursed and no one would be the wiser.ETA: Now that my son is 10 months old, I use it an awful lot again as a hip carrier. The only con is that I live in a VERY hot climate and this is too warm for us to use outside. I made one myself from directions found on the internet and I use it a lot more than this one, mostly because of the bulk of the NoJo sling."
1,Not as good as others....,"There are 3 problems with this sling:1) It comes in one size that is only good for people who need a large size sling.2) The rings are grooved, which makes it hard or impossible to adjust it once you are wearing it.3) It isn't wide enough to be as safe as possible. We have to hold onto our baby when he's in this sling.Dh and I only use this sling when the other 4 are in the wash. Dr. Sears really screwed this one up.Vastly superior slings can be found at your local La Leche League group or through these web sites:KangarooKorner.com (carries shower slings also)mayawrap.combabysling.com"
1,too hot for summer,"If you live in a hot climate or are going to get one of these for summer, don't! This sling was much too padded and hot for me and my baby. Everytime I put my daughter in this, we would both be sweating within minutes and it worried me because she would be breathing very fast. Try a lightly padded sling or one with no padding, you'll both be way more comfortable."
2,too big for small women,"i registered for this sling because i thought it would be a good way to bond with my baby.i am a slender woman (5' 4"", 115) and i found that i couldn't tighten this sling enough to keep my baby snug.we ended up getting a baby bjorn instead, and it works wonderfully."
3,Nojo Sling,I did not care for the Nojo sling because it is very bulky. It cannot easily fit it into the diaper bag and I cannot tighten the sling as much as I need to due to the padding. Other than that it was ok.I now use a sling with no padding on the side and I take it everywhere. It fits in the diaper bag and I can even wear it without the baby in it in the store until it is needed. I probably will never use my Nojo again.
1,dangerous sling,"I used this sling when my son was a newborn. It was difficult to adjust and often seemed to be too large, burying him in fabric. It was hard to tighten it sufficiently for my body. I needed to wash it two or three times due to diaper failures. I followed all the care directions, but the sling fabric was so thin that it actually tore with my son in it!!! Luckily, I caught him in time. Very disturbing!I could not return it to babies r us store or get any help from nojo.I bought the over the shoulder baby holder and was totally satisfied.How can nojo sell this cheaply made sling?"
1,waaaaaayyyyy too much padding,"I ordered both the Nojo and the New Native baby sling thinking one of them has to work. I'm average sized but I just felt like my baby and I were swallowed up in all the padding of the Nojo. Having just had a baby, the last thing I need is extra padding! The Native sling was easier to get baby in, but I think I ordered the wrong size, because I didn't like how low my son hung. I like the idea of an adjustable sling better, and my baby doesn't care for the cradle position except when nursing. I read the reviews here and ordered a padded sling from Babymoon Slings and we are much happier."
3,Not for petite people,"I am 5 feet 2 inches and weigh around 110 pounds. For my figure, the Nojo sling was too bulky and loose. The tightest setting was still too loose when my baby was very young (I returned this item). Instead, I made my own after learning how to on the internet. I like my handmade one a lot better."
1,find a better sling,"My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a sling from babymoon slings. It fit me better and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings."
2,its ok.. have used better...,"This sling just isn't as comfortable as othe slings I've tried. The padding made it hard to adjust and I dont think its quite wide enough to support my baby in a way I feel comfortable. I tried Maya and NNB and had better luck with those.. gonna stick with my AP from thebabyspace.net much better design and easier to use! If you aren't going to be using the sling much go ahead and try NoJo, but if its something you plan on using more often find a different sling to put your money into."
1,Not a good product,I returned this the very next day. This item is too bulky/cumbersome and the material is not comfortable at all.
1,"Slings are necessary, but don't buy this one!!","My baby is 6 months old and I have tried multiple times to use this sling with little success. You cannot adjust this sling easily and it is not tight enough for the baby to move around in the hip straddle or kangaroo positions. I have to keep a hand on the baby while I do any activities. I took the sling to someone who has been wearing slings for 5 years and it took her 20 minutes to adjust it just right and within 10 minutes he was falling out again.Luckily, I bought this sling second-hand for really cheap, otherwise I would be extremely disappointed!!"
4,Great Sling,"Although this does take a little getting use to, this is a great sling. I have used it with 2 babies from birth up to toddlerhood. I love how it holds your newborn closer than regular front carriers. Both of my daughters would instantly fall asleep. I also like that it can be used to nurse discreetly. Some have complained about too much material and it being too long, but with a little adjusting and patience, it should fit any caregiver. I used it on my toddler right up until my new daughter was born. A great and affordable sling. And Dr Sears is the expert!!!"
1,not the best sling around by far,"I bought this before my baby was born because I wanted a carrier I could breastfeed in. I was never able to in the Nojo because all the padding got in the way. I found it was too big --the rings would run into the padding before it was tight enough to feel safe--my baby always hung down too low for it to be comfortable on me (I'm 5'5"" but slender). My baby did like being in it, though, in the cradle position which prompted me to search the internet for a better fitting sling with less padding which I found at Babymoon Slings (although I wished I'd saved my original 30 bucks on the nojo!). I think the Nojo works for some people that are just the right size it's designed for- or they just haven't tried anything else out there. Save yourself some money and back pain and do some research before you buy this one."
1,Size does matter,"When our baby was born, we had a couple of baby carriers that didn't work quite right. I ran out to the local hippy baby store in Montreal and bought a Heart-to-Heart Baby sling ([...]), which has been fantastic.When my brother and sister-in-law in California had their second baby, I wanted to get them a Heart-to-Heart, but isn't available from Amazon.com. I considered the Nojo, but the reviews here and elsewhere made it sound pretty low quality. I ended up ordering the Over the Shoulder Baby Holder ([...]) which seems to get much better feedback from people."
5,Awesome,"Although this book was used, and had cut-out figurines, all of the originals were included. My daughter loves this book. Great book and great price."
5,Learning Suminagashi,"I fell in love with the technique of Suminagashi. There are numerous videos on YouTube but not too many answers to go along with the vids. This book is excellent. There is actually very little written info out there. Suminagashi is the art of floating specific ink on water and then printing it to paper or fabric. Actually a marbling technique but without the mess. Just need ink, water, pan and paper. Use of black ink alone with delicate manipulation of the pattern by blowing on the surface of the water, produces a beautiful design. Colors can be used and the size of the print is limited only by your imagination and how big a piece of paper or fabric you can actually handle, with or without help. Some control by the artist but much more serendipity involved than with traditional marbling. Traditional marbling came from the mid-east around Turkey but Suminagashi comes from Japan. Lots of history included in this book. Sumi ink and India ink can both be used."
4,Very good tool,I really like this tool. The plunge release/lock mechanism is th ebest around. MUCH nicer than dewalt's or PorterCable's. The motor is smooth and the micro-adjust mechanism works beautifully. My only complaint is that the top is not flat and bit changes are a little less convenient as a result. Pretty minor compared to the tool's overall performance.
4,Great for price,"I have had this for just over a year now and my only complaint is that it is quite noisy. Next time I will splurge and get the quiter model. But for the price, this is great."
1,Nothing but trouble with this router,"I bought this router in October along with all of the accessories--extra base, dust hoods (don't work), fine adjustment knob--totaling over $330.00. It has caused me nothing but TROUBLE! First a c-ring kept falling off when I used it in my router table, and then the fine adjustment knob extension snapped off while trying to put it in the adjustment knob. And today, just as I was trying to finish up a project, it stopped working altogether. It refuses to turn on. I almost bought another Porter Cable--wish I had!"
5,A Great little router,"Bosch has made a fine router! Easy to adjust, powerful, smooth and quiet.. I like the rather compact size too.. highly recommend this package.. jh"
2,"Regular base = fine, plunge base & switch are totally faulty","I've used this for 5 years or so. The regular base is great for someone needing a moderate power router - it's not a high power router for heavy regular use. The plunge router is poorly designed making for continual need to tighten bolts on the handles. The switch has gone out twice on my machine. First time I bought a new one after looking for awhile online. 2nd time I realized that YOU CAN FIX THE SWITCH: pull it out, file the contacts off (it's faulty probably because of the wrong metals used in the switch causing sparks and carbon build up on the contacts thus reducing it's ability to conduct current).All in all it's a pretty faulty product with some strong elements. I've used a Porter Cable 3+ HP for years professionally and they seemed way more solid than this machine."
3,Where's the bonus?,"Great tool - but where's my bonus items. The ad specifically said that to be included was a ""bonus accessory package."" It was to include centering cone, 5/8, 7/16, and 5/16 template guides, dust hood, and fine adjustment extension knob. This was part of the reason I thought it was a good deal. I could have bought just the tool itself several places for the same price but I bought it through amazon because of the bonus items."
1,Quality,Do not buy this Bosch Router. Mine arrived with a broken speed switch.I was obviously broken as i could see the red rotary switch was pushed into the housing and there were broken red plastic parts in the box. I think that Bosch has let it's quality slip.Another product from China no doubt. I would give it no stars if this was possible.
4,Router,"The dust collector plastic window was broken in half when received out of the box. There should be a mechanism for getting this small part without sending the entire package back. The router package itself was excellent, and I am using both the plunge router and fixed base for many projects.Thankyou, Martin Decere (madecere@aol.com)"
5,Terrific router,"This is a superb tool. The ease of setup,soft start capability and ease of use of both the fixed and plunge bases make this a terrific value. I've worked with other router brands and they are good quality products but this tool has had a lot of thought in the design and manufacturing process. It is apparent that input seems to have come from some quality woodworkers in the development of this product. The package includes both bases and switching between them is a snap(no tools needed). At 2.25 horses it offers the ability to be mounted in a router table. This is a very complete package. Bosch makes very high quality tools."
3,"Nice router, just needs accessories","They should sell a kit labeled ""all those things we should have put in the box, but decided we could charge extra for"". I bought this router because I needed it NOW when my usual router switch went out. I got it, discovered I couldn't use my template guide, so I bought a template guide adapter, only to discover that I needed a template guide adapter adapter or some such horse do do. Also, no edge guide, no dust control, not much else useful thank you very much. Frankly I am a little disgusted that they can't charge 10 bucks more and have the thing be useful out of the box. The tragic thing is I bought it at a brick and mortar store and specifically asked if the template guide would fit. The answer was ""I don't know, but it looks like it might"". Well it doesn't, and a week later I still haven't done the routing I need to do. A good router as long as all you want to do is mangle wood."
1,Chinese?,I was routing a raised panel door today and the routed fell and dropped to the bottom of the Bosch routed table that is a piece of junk. The screws are stripped out and I will have to find longer screws and put nuts on the ends.Surely Bosch can do better than this.
5,Bosch the best quality tool for the wood worker,"My husbands valentines gift he woodworks at home,making tables, cabinets ,frames,moldings.and he wanted a router that uses the 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch collets the day he got this router he opened and had to test it and loved it.This is his second Bosch router his older one he has had for 10 years plus but it doesn't have the extras and haven't been able to buy seperate ,got him this one with the extras and if you are a serious wood worker you want to be ale to do more and this router does that,big and small projects with or without the router table."
2,Great router when it works,I bought this router in Dec 2004. In Jan of Feb of 2005 I had to send it into Bosch because the on off switch only worked sporadically. It worked fine for about a year and I had to send it in again for the same problem. Both times it was fixed under warranty but I still had to pay to ship it to them. Well its broken again same problem it has been acting up since February and has finally quit altogether. Fortunately I have a 20yr old Black and Decker that I paid less that $50.00 for as a spare. It is not nearly as fancy but when I press the start switch it works. I will be looking for a new router but it won't be a Bosch. The one I have now is a $225.00 paper weight.
4,junk,"I've had this kit for about a year and a half, and I am also having switch problems. Kind of disappointing to pay the extra money for a heavy duty tool and then have problems with it. Other than the switch it has worked fine, lots of power and very smooth.update: now the bearings are shot, after four years of very occasional use. Bosch says this is normal. $140 to fix. $200 for new PC router set. This is a no-brainer."
1,Great when it was working - but not long,"Had this router for about 2 years of light and sparse use. Easy to use and plenty of power when it was working but then it quit suddenly. It's not the switch, it turns on, turns slowly, hums and smells like burning wires. Not sure if I will try to have it fixed. Probably cost more to fix it than replace it. Won't replace it with a new Bosch."
3,nice tool but it did not last long,"I purchased this router December 8, 2008 and have logged about 20 hours of actual run time, just a guess, it could be 10 hours, it could be 30, but in any case, not a lot of run time before failure. I just got the bill for repair, $82 to replace the on-off switch and the variable speed module. Bosch admits to a switch problem in earlier versions of this model but would not cover this one.The router worked well until it simply would not turn on, if not for this failure (not covered by Bosch) I would have rated it 5 stars."
2,1617EVSPK GOES NON INDUSTRY STANDARD,"This Bosch Router would not function as a dovetail jig router. The base opening is non standard opening.tried for days to purchased the required template bushing adapter. The Bosch adapter is out of stock. the entire country did not have the adapter. Makita, Milwauke, PC, DW, and Hitachi all have the same size template opening and thus utilize the PC bushings for dovetail routing.The 1617 is an odd duck and makes a case for nickle and dime do IT MY WAY. All the named routers do a good job. Be smart, 1617 has fans as it is a fine tool. and consider a router that follows Industry standards. Of course the Pro level DW and Milwaukee and PC are appropriate alternatives to consider.The power switch is not sealed - clogs with sawdust."
5,Bosh router,How can ya go wrong with bosh. This was purchase for a new router table I built with a lift in it. It has all the power needed to accomplish the largest of tasks. I wanted this combo unit so I could drop thr motor out of the table and use the plung base when needed. It's awesome. Very happy with this.
4,good,"I have two of these, the On/off switch will get clogged with saw dust and unit will not turn on. Easy to fix and a good router other than that."
5,Fine Product,"Probably the third router I've bought in the last 10+ years, so I'm not a heavy user, but I'm very happy with it. Workmanship and materials both seem excellent."
2,not 24 hours shipping,"Ordered the Bosch 1617EVSPK kit on June 3rd and currently still waiting for it to be shipped. Just wanted to let potential buyers know that although the website says ""uaually ships in 24hours"" there is a dalay on this item. Current delivery date is mid july for mine if it does not delay further. Still looking forward to receiving it and writing a proper review, the new router table is assembled and waiting with nothing to do."
1,Where's my BONUS package?,"I also, did not received the BONUS package advertised with this router. Seems many of us are having the same problem."
5,Exceptional !!,"I just reveived this router, so it has not received any use yet, but by the look of things, this is going to be one heck of a router. I have compared this to DeWalt, Porter-Cable, Makita, and Milwaukee. No doubt, this is the best by a mile in terms of fit and finish, heft, useability, and overall build qauilty. Combine all of these attributes, with the included edge guide, work mat, and just the right size carrying case with steel hinges and you have a router that will accomplish almost any task, which requires up to a 2 inch router bit. You can even make small raised panals with this kit, however, it would be better to use a 3HP machine for any rasied panals over 2 inches. The Bosch is one of the most functional router kits around and also looks professional as well. I can't wait to start using it for some remodeling projects that are coming up soon and will post more as I put some hours on the machine."
3,Fake Price Decrease,I like how I had this in my cart 2 weeks ago at 220.00 then today i come back and they have it on sale for 20.00 less but i see they act like the regular price was double what it was previously. It now lists it at over 400.00. Doesn't Kohl's get sued for this?
2,quality control,"I purchased this router after considerable research. Upon receiving the kit I was fairly pleased. I used it for a brief period of time (less than two hours) on my first project and found the weight, feel, noise and control to be very pleasing. Upon trying to use it on my second project, the router would not switch on. I was not happy. I called Bosch, and of course they apologized and referred me to a service center, surprised of course because they had no idea that there was a problem with the switch. Upon setting up repairs with the service center they claimed that it was not a surprise because the switch used is undersized and it is not the first one they have had to replace. Just beware, I like everything about the router so far, but I am afraid that too many corners have been cut on their design and quality control.I will replace the switch and will probably have to do so frequently."
2,Bosch 1617EVSPK 2.25 HP Electronic VS Plunge and Fixed Base Router Kit,"Bought it from Amazon a few years ago. I have other Bosch tools and am more than satisfied with them. This one is another story. Cosmetically, the router looked great at first. Fit and finish seemed to be very nice. But after about 6 months I noticed some corrosion on the magnesium body. This got worse, much worse. It now looks as if someone took a grinder to it. In Bosch's defense, however, I have not contacted them yet to see if they will do anything about this. My shop is in my basement, but I keep the humidity pretty much controlled. Nothing else has any rust or corrosion. Other than that, the router does perform well, the soft start and variable speed is nice. I haven't used the plunge base much so can't comment on that. I have read other reviews on the corrosion on e-pinions. One reviewer said that Bosch is working with him on the problem."
3,Great Router when it runs.,"I am new to wood working and found this router to be easy to use and set up. The micro adjustment is precise. The motor has enough power to shape oak without any issue.Update: October 14, 2012 Earlier this year after minimal use (less than 5 hours run time) the switch stopped functioning. Fortunately the router was still under warranty. I took it to a Bosh factory service center and they replaced the switch in less than 10 minutes.It has been six months since I had the warranty repair made and I have less than 2 hours of run time on the router. It stopped in mid operation and will not turn back on. I was using the router on a router table with a 1/4"" up spiral bit making a 3/8' deep groove in quarter sawn white oak. I will need to take it back for repairs again; it is now past the warranty so this time it will cost money. The repair cost is not the primary issue. This is the second time in a year that this router has left me stranded in the middle of a project."
2,The advertising is incorrect.,"Be warned, if you think that the tool less template guide adapter is included in the kit as it is advertised in the ad, it is not. The template guide adapter is mentioned twice in the ad as being part of the ""kit,"" but according to Bosch customer service, it is not. The part, required to adapt any template guides to the bottom of the router base is an additional $15 plus shipping. If you use router template guides, you'll have to add that cost to the price of the set. Another case of sloppy advertising at best or, a case of false advertising."
5,routing 101,Haven`t used the Bosch 1617evspk a lot since I purchased it but here`s my thoughts so far. Adjustments are smooth and accrurate. The soft start is a pleasure to use. I would highly recomend this product.
2,"Loved it at first, but........","Initially I was quite pleased and still have no complaints about power, quality of cut, etc. The biggest problem is with the depth adjustment freezing up. If you don't want to use a pipe wrench to turn it you have to constantly clean and polish the motor assy with fine sandpaper and this only helps for a month or so. Also the round, slick wood handles suck to hold onto and keep coming loose. I've recently replaced it with the dewalt 618 3 base kit and am extremely pleased with the ease of adjustment. Finally I can spend more time routing than I do messing with the router. (also has oblong textured grips that are easy to hold onto)"
2,Bad trigger,I have had two and both triggers have gone out. They will not work after very few uses. There is a problem with this product.
4,Work's great,"I'm into woodworking, I have probably 5 or so routers in my cabinets. This one has turned into my ""goto"" router for when I need to do plunge routing. Even though it comes with a fixed base, the plunge base works really well. I replaced a Porter Cable plunge router with this one. The lock on the Bosch plunge base works much better, and has been reliable."
3,Where is the light?,"A very well made and good router, but very difficult to see your work through the plastic sawdust cover. I can't understand why this router does not have a built in light. It should be a ""must have"" on any router. If I had realized it did not have a light, I would not have purchased it. Oh well!"
4,Excellent Router,"An excellent tool. It's a in a different galaxy from my hand-me-down Sears 1/2 HP router. Plenty of power. Easy to adjust depth of cut in the fixed base. I bought the extension knob and it works pretty well in a router table. Love the plunge base, but then it's my first. Only drawback that I have seen is that many accessory bases - Jasper Cirlce Template for example - don't have hole pattern to fit the 1617."
3,Not shipped in 24 hours. Where's my bonus items?!?,"Just received the router today, after about 2 weeks. When I ordered it, there were bonus items that were supposed to go with this including a ""Deluxe cutting guide"" and much more. I didn't get any bonus items and now, the info and link to the bonus items is gone from the Amazon website. Anyone have it?"
1,poor quality control,"Sealed Box - Looked new on outsideScuffed Carry Case - Strange, is Bosch trying to pass off used or refurbed as new?Router - Deep scratch about an inch long in the metal, many scuffs on the metal, a couple scratches in the plasticPower Cord - several gouges taken out of it with one spot showing copper wireFixed base - one handle loosePlunge base - scuff markPlunge base also had a little wobblie when pushing down, not feeling like a quality tool. Because of the unsafe power wire I did not turn it on to test the motor.I purchased at a big home center. I guess Bosch use to make quality tools but now they are made in Mexico. Really shocked at how bad the quality control of this Bosch tool. I totally changed my oppinion of Bosch, i thought they were suppose to be the best, but now I don't think so."
4,Another great book by Margaret Maron.,"In this novel Deborah Knott visits the pottery making area of Asheboro, NC. She is sent to the area by the Chief Judge to help clear out a backlogged court calendar. She hopes to buy a platter for her new home. One of the cases involves the divorce of two people from famous potting families. Just before their valuable collection is divided, the husband is brutally murdered. In addition to untangling the marital woes of the area, she now has to solve a murder.This is another excellent novel by Maron. She takes us to yet another area of North Carolina, and her descriptions are very vivid. She gives you many clues to solve the mystery, yet I still didn't figure it out until nearly the end. Great book!!"
2,a bit outdated,"When i received the book, i was somewhat dissappointed. Even though it had a few good ideas..... it was a bit outdated. First of all it was published in 1998. I feel that an updated version should have been available."
5,Great Tool!,Excellent book! Very thorough and provides step-by-step advice from meeting the administration and previewing the school to setting up the classroom and how to teach all divided by grade level. I would highly recommend this book!
1,they teach all this in college,"I didn't see anything in this book that was not covered in my college courses. I felt like the author assumed I knew nothing, and it felt like she was speaking down to me. I wish I had never bought this book because now I have to deal with the hassle of returning it."
3,"It is ""OK""","I was not impressed with this book. It was not as interesting or an informational as i had hoped. I read rookie teaching for dummies and i had really liked it It is not a bad book, it has some good ideas, they are just a little ""fluffy"". It is not good, it is not bad, it is just ok."
3,Good for Readers,"If you're going to be a teacher, and you can read well, try Bonnie's book out. It can't hurt: At the least, the book will get the mental wheels spinning for soft education majors. Other reviewers (below) who gave this book 1-2 stars may well be from a union campaign. They know that if *some* teachers are actually prepared, then *they'll all* have to do some work! I say, ""Let's raise the bar, folks! Teachers *should* read books, and teachers should be prepared. Let's leave the days of lazy, chubby, chit chat about sit-coms, 'not my job' teaching behind us!"" Bonnie's book is a step in the right direction. I suggest it for all teachers who can read well."
1,Concerned Teacher,"I have a copy of Bonnie Williamson's Book The First-Year Teacher's Guidebook and it is one of the worst I have seen written. At one point it told the teacher to humiliate a student in front of the class to get them to conform. Scary book! Sorry, not for me or any of my fellow teachers. It should be zero stars."
2,Not helpful enough...,"This book was a big disappointment - especially with the $17.95 price. I was looking for ideas on how to set up my classroom, manage my classroom and organize my room. Instead, this book spent too much time focusing on what to do when you are initially hired - such as meet with the building principal, tour the area, get familiar with your new school. Although this info is important, it really won't help someone get through the day to day aspects of teaching - which is what I was after."
2,No real substance,"I found the book to be full of surface level, common-sense platitudes that didn't really give me much more advice than I'd gotten from my college courses. I was looking for a book that would give me more substantial help in starting my first classroom (examples of classroom setup, reproducibles for classroom organization, etc.). This book did not fill my needs.In addition, the book is written specifically for elementary teachers, although there is the occasional nod to those teaching sixth grade. As a middle school teacher, much of the advice within was not very applicable."
3,The REAL Teen Titans,"These are the 'New' Teen Titans that started in the early 80's. The originals included Robin, Wondergirl, etc..The only disappointing part of this set is that Cyborg is gold. The other figures depict the characters as they were back then, not the newly revised cartoon version. They are repaints of figures issued separately. Other than that, they are great figures. The 'monkey' by the way, is Changeling after he 'changes' shape into an animal."
2,"Very, very small",I have never seen earrings so small. I think they would be good for a little girl. They were very hard to open up...in fact one wouldn't open at all. I'm going to return them.
1,DEFECTIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I received these back in April and it is now September. Only one earring locks properly. The other earring was difficult to open and once I got it open it would not lock in place and would fall off. I contacted seller 2X with not even one response.Plenty of other sellers to purchase from. Buyer beware! Nothing worse than a seller who sells defective junk and ignores customers.
4,Unlike Most Rock Bands Out There,"Blues for the Red Sun is definitely the best Kyuss release out of the three available. This CD is definitely a must have for anyone who closely follows Josh Homme's music. This CD also has Nick Oliveri playing bass which is always cool. Though Kyuss is not quite as innovative in its musical sound as Queens of the Stoneage it is still a very solid rock album and one to be proud to have blasting in your car or stereo at home. So if you sick of MTV ""pop"" rock, and like queens of the stoneage, or are a fan of the older style of rock, then pick up Blues for the Red Sun and see how rock is done in the Arizona desert."
1,Another Flash In The Pan,"I owned this album,and the same day I took it back.The music was repetitive,and boring. These guys tried a little too hard to be heavy, and it backfired upon them.The drums were lacking creativity,and talent.The vocals were flat,and range was absent.the bass and guitars were selfish and focused upon too much. It's a blessing these folks from Kyuss gave up, I'm mean broke up."
1,God awful,These reviewers must tbe on crack to compare this band to balck Sbbath. Kyuss sounds worse than an 80's hair band.
4,Blues Is Happy Music,"Much has been said about Kyuss having been fuelled by peyote, various hallucinogens and other drugs. And like a drug trip the best way to actually understand it is to experience it because words just don't really express or explain when. This is hard rocking psychadelica at its best with no bull. Even better Kyuss don't take them selves too seriously, which translates here to the band not only playing brilliant but playing with great enthusiasm because there having such fun.This is joyous blissed out music which deserves a spot in everyon rock fans collection"
4,One Step Away From Perfection,"Kyuss creates music that no one else can duplicate. It's perfect for those long hot summer days and even better for the humid nights that follow. Listening to this album makes you want to hop in a convertible and drive through the desert ""Fear and Loathing Style"".Kyus has a groove like none other, and here they begin to perfect it. The openers ""Thumb"" and ""Green Machine"" rock you hard. With his tuned down guitar, Josh Homme creates riffs that resemble an egg frying on a driveway. Songs like ""50 Million Year Trip"" and ""Allen's Wrench"" rock the same.However, the best song on this album without a doubt is ""Freedom Run"" which starts out slow and builds into a smooth riff and jams you into an euphoric oblivion. The instrumental jams here stand out as well, ""Caterpillar March"" has a flow that will have you rocking.Kyuss prefects their sound on their next album, ""Welcome to Sky Valley"", but this is album is right on that threshold."
5,"Buy it, don't delay","I first heard about Kyuss while reading an interview with Glenn Danzig back in the early '90's. Danzig counted Kyuss as one of his favorite bands which immediately sent me to the store to find and buy a Kyuss album. I was not disappointed. While I cannot recommend any Kyuss albums before or since ""Blues.."", I can definately say this album is without a doubt one of the best albums I have ever heard, period. If you have never heard of Kyuss, you are in the majority. But the majority is often cheated by the radio and music industry. Don't let them deprive you of this gift any longer."
2,"great gloves, bad insulation","i work in a freezer in a local grocery store(huge walk in and even the display type). after about only 3 minutes working on the displays, its as if i was just wearing the normal atlas fit ones as the insulation seems to be made for temperatures of 40 degrees and above. if you want a slightly insulated light duty work glove, this is for you. if you work in below freezing weather, look elsewhere."
5,Great as winter ultimate frisbee gloves,I bought these gloves to keep my hands warm while playing ultimate frisbee in the winter. I play in New England and these are much warmer and cheaper than fancy wide receiver gloves.
2,Unsuccessful mixing of regency and present time,"Although I love both regency and time travelling novels, I must say that this book is a rather poor combination of the two of them and would have been better without the time travelling part. The present day heroine is kind of sex-starved, the transitions between present and past are unconvincing and sometimes even confusing. The regency part (with a regency heroine) itself would have been a nice enough story."
3,The stars are for Blair,"It happened again!!! So often I have read a book and the hero was great, stupendous, out of this world. And the heroine???? Slightly less than perfect. This would have been a good book, but the heroine seemed to me to have fallen in lust with the guy, not love. She had been living with her boyfriend (an automatic turn off for me, right off the bat) and it seemed like she just had an itch that needed scratched. Anyway, short story--he was great and the book would have been great with a different type girl. The time travel was a bit jarring as well. I agree with the other reviewers. This would have been a strong Regency without it. And for me, with a different female lead.Also, not complaining, but this seemed a bit racy for a Regency. At least the Regencies I've read."
5,Fantastic,"These are possibly the best strings i have ever put on my guitar, I bought them because they are the same string Coheed and Cambria use and I am not dissapointed."
4,A Wonderful Review of Efficient Structural Systems,"This book is an excellent summary (with wonderful illustrations)of the state of current knowledge on thin shells, fabric and other tensile structures. It is a valuable resource for engineers and architects interested in this modern, visually-striking area of design."
3,Geodesic Book Shortage,"This book was alright. I wanted to learn more about Geodesic Dome Home Living and This book was more about the Arcitecture and Engineering of geodesics. It was interesting, but I wanted floor plans and more example homes."
5,again?,that's another single i've lost count this is the best though best rhymes flow beat even video i've had the album for like a month easily now and it's hot son (clue put it out early to promo them they so good)
3,Package was opened,It looked like the package came from a flee market or at the least a returned one the package was riped opened the taped
5,Nice unit,"This unit is well thought out, you don't have to add any boards to the guide face, looks great. I really like the fact you don't need any wrenchs or allens to adjust it. It's a little sticky in it movement out of the box but a quick rub with some 000 wool on the sliding bars and it's smooth as slik. There are two other bar slots just inside of the outer bars, nothing in the directions mentions this, so I can't comment on them. I looked at all edge guides out there before I bought this one and I'm a satisfied customer."
3,Very accurate,This product is bulky but allows for very fine adjustment. It needs a case to keep it protected when not in use. I made a storage case out of the original shipping container so that is one possibility for a product that is not used on a frequent basis. The vacuum hose adapter was useless.
1,Deluxe Router guide adjustment knob didn't work at all,The router guide adjustment knob didn't work at all. When you dial the fine adjustment knob to go closer to your work it didn't respond. It would just turn and do nothing. The design behind the tool should of worked well but this particular tool I received didn't. It was as thought there was some part missing for the adjustment knob to make the router come closer for cuts. I would like to try a different router guide brand. I don't believe a great brand like Bosch would make a tool work like this. I'm sure there was just something wrong with this one. I returned it and Amazon was stellar in crediting me and paying shipping going back.
4,"I'm sure it's great, but...","When I ordered it I anticipated getting a Bosch router for my birthday. However, instead I received a Porter-Cable router. It's great, but the edge guide is not made for it, and too much time had passed to return the Bosch edge guide to Amazon. So now I have an unopened Bosch RA1054 that I cannot use, sitting in my shop."
4,Bosch Router Guide,This router guide is nifty.The vacuum hose adapter does not fit my shop-vac OR my shop-vac adapter. It seems to be designed for a metric attachment? I cannot find an adapter. I bought this off of Amazon because it was the cheapest I could find. I didn't want to spend anymore money than what I had to because I wasn't sure that it would be anymore useful than the the jigs I make with scrap wood. And you know what? It's not any better than a homemade jig. But it looks cool and it works. Well except the hose adapter which probably works if you own a Bosch vacuum made in Europe. The radius attachment uses a suction cup and it does not work very well in a dusty environment. Fortunately most woodworkers do not work in dusty environments... LOL
2,"bulky, accurate but plastic adjustable edges break easily","Sure enough, after barely using this edge guide the sliding plastic edges of it's fence broke just from having the tool sit on the backseat of my car with other tools, maybe something rolled on top of the tool but it was't dropped. Now, I have to buy another new complete guide or make or find the delicate edge pieces of my fence.I do have the latest humongous new Bosch plunge router to go with this and that's been a great tool. I'll keep searching for the edge guides of fence or make some outta hardwood....they'd be tougher than the plastic ones."
4,Seems like a quality part so far,"This is a precision part, nicely designed and easy to adjust and to adapt to different uses. In case you were wondering, it comes with all the knobs and all to attach it both to the Bosch router and plunge base.There have been a couple of reviews saying that it is kind of delicate. That is not good; tools need to have a ruggedness factor built in because they do get misused and they shouldn't break if they are misused only a little. Since I believe these other reviewers, It loses a star."
4,Good Guide,Does what it's supposed to. Good fit and finish. Micrometer adjust is worth its weight in gold.
5,Perfect Router Edge Guide for Bosch router,"TheBosch RA1054 Deluxe Router Edge Guide With Dust Extraction Hood & Vacuum Hose Adapterfits perfectly on the European version(GMF 1400 CE Professional) of the Bosch 1617EVSPK router, and has the added bonus of a dust extraction hood & Vacuum hose adapter, wich is lacking on the European variant. It might seem a bit fragile compared to it's European counterpart, however it performs as one would expect from a Blue-series Bosh."
3,Versitile,"Nice product, very versitile and configurable.Quality is a bit lacking but it is fairly inexpensive.Because I have a Bosch router I would purchase again but there is no comparison to Festool"
3,"so, so, but works","I have about 6 bosch tools including the 2 1/4 hp router this is used on. I use them professionaly and they are the better of the tools I own. The guide is good engineered piece but the fit and finish along with the tolerances are so, so. The adjustments are course and a bit crude. The plastic adjustable shoes are fragile where the are anchored by the screw to the frame. It is a good concept but they never followed threw in refining it with in finer thread screws for the adjustment, better fit and finish of the slide rods and alloy shoes with two hold down bolts with bigger washers. It works, but could be better. I guess I never look at it on the wall and go, ""that is an great router guide"" and feel like I want to use it."
4,A Fine Character Study of a 72 Year-old Woman Looking Back on Her Life,"At 72 years old Lily has written her memoirs. It is her first attempt at writing and she has become an instant celebrity. She chronicles her life in the 1960's and the differences between herself and her minister husband on race and empowerment that eventually led to their divorce.Now, frail and unable to write because of Parkinson's disease, she goes to live with her son Alan. Their relationship is conflicted and unresolved. We get to see Lily through the eyes of her assistant, her family and herself. We see her meanness masked as directness and self-expression. We see her as she reminisces abut herself as a naive young bride with a strong social conscience and love for her community.This book is a great character study and very well-written."
3,Failed to draw me in,"`The Distinguished Guest' reads more like a character study than a novel. It is the story of a proud elderly woman who goes to live with her son's family as her health is deteriorating due to Parkinson's disease, and the impact this has on them.Miller's skill at bringing Lily's character to life is undeniable, but the end result isn't very likeable. Lily is self-centered, full of herself, and on occasion downright mean, and although the book goes some way into explaining how she got that way, I could not bring myself to feel any sympathy for her.Remaining characters, on the other hand, have very little depth - they are almost like rough sketches of the characters they would eventually become, but haven't yet been fleshed-out enough.I'm normally a fan of Sue Miller's work, and was really looking forward to reading this, but this book (possibly in light of higher expectations) was a bit of a disappointment."
2,A Disapointment,"The Distinguished Guest is about a Lily Maynard who is suffering with Parkinsons Disease. She is staying in the home of her Son Alan eventhough these two have had their differences in the past. I was not able to connect with any of these characters and found this book kind of uninteresting and I spent a longer time than usual to finish. I found this book a true dissapointment because I usually enjoy reading Sue Miller's books. My recomendation is to read ""The Good Mother"" instead."
2,Unwelcome Visitor,"I love Sue Miller she is one of my favorite authors but she falls short in the Distinguished Guest. The book deals with religion as one would deal with a shopping list. It is boring and repeats itself constantly. The book is a two night read but it took me over two weeks to force my way through it. She throws in a rather graphic sex scene near the end - probably to make sure the readers are still awake. Lily, the aged best selling author and main character, is unbelievable and totally unlikeable. Skip this one. Glad I got such a good price on Amazon or I would really be upset."
3,Mixed Emotions,"This book left me with mixed emotions. At times I liked it, and at times I was left feeling disappointed. I think she could have done a better job with this story. I do know that I didn't like some of the characters, and maybe that's why I was left with the mixed feelings about the book over all."
2,A Guest Not so Distinguished As You Might Think.,"I found this book quite disappointing. It is about an elderly woman named Lily Maynard and her family. Or what is left of it. She is a divorced mother of three children, technically, although one has sort of disappeared (and the more you read the more you think you might have done the same). Miller highlights Lily's shining moments as an author and the fame and popularity her talents have found. Her son, Alan, takes her in temporarily until there is room for her at the nursing home. She is somewhat unbearable, although, that was not the real problem with this novel. For some reason, unlike Miller's other works, it was just really super boring. I kept reminding myself not to walk away without finishing it. Without at least giving it that much of a chance. At the end, instead of feeling like it was a good book after all, I was just glad I had finished it. Not the worst but certainly not the best."
2,A Crashing Bore,"We read this book for our library book club, and I do this because often it makes me read things I wouldn't normally read, and most of the time I am glad I did, but this one was one of the most tiresome books I have read in a long time. I did not find the people real, the writing was stilted, and Lily herself is a poor excuse for a heroine. What, after all, has she done except have a failed marriage, 3 children from whom she is somewhat if not completely estranged, and an experience of sorts with racial tensions. She writes a book about herself at 72? How did she manage it since she had so little to say and so little accomplishment. Why would anyone have read it? None of this does the author make clear. I had to push myself to read the book about the book, it took me a month, and in the end, why did I bother? I have never read anything else by Sue Miller, and now I doubt if I will."
3,Not sure,"The book is well-written, but I still have to find out how medically acceptable his theories are. And I ws disappointed to find that even if I follow his main plan and get rid of the IBS, I'd have to maintain pretty much the same diet I'm already on for the rest of my life. To me, this is not exactly a cure. However, the ideas he presents are interesting and in opposition to many views of IBS. Worth reading."
5,A New IBS Solution,"I ordered this book for my sister who suffers from SIBO, she has found it very informative."
4,New IBS Solution,This book also addresses SIBO and provides information that makes it easier to understand. Thus it is easier to make the better diet decisions. I wish there was a bit more about diet but using the info given I can really see a change in how I feel. Definitely worth reading.
2,not for people whose IBS was CAUSED by antibiotics,"In this book, the author says he doubts whether there is really ""good"" or ""bad"" bacterica, and discourages the use of probiotics. I developed IBS 2 years ago after repeated courses of antibiotics wiped out the good bacteria in my system. The lack of good bacteria allowed Candida fungus to grow, and I developed gatrointestinal candidiasis, which caused all of the symptoms of IBS until I started taking the antifungal Nystatin. This book may apply to people who developed IBS after food poisoning, but it definitely has a myopic approach. I would recommend the book by Stephen Wangen instead."
4,An overlooked psychedelic gem frpm the '90s.,"Slick vocals, solid songwriting and more backwards guitars than a roomful of Bevis Frond outtakes distinguish this forgotten slab of feedback soaked, modal psychedelia from it's grunge-damaged peers.Well worth taking a chance on, if you're a fan of this style."
1,wrong!,"this is a recreation of a great band and it is totally wrong! someone took the same exact title, same style of cover, and put totally new lyrics and music and people in it. it's horrible!"
3,"NOT the ""Whipped Cream and Other Delights"" I wanted","This is NOT the album ""Whipped Cream and Other Delights"" by Herb Alpert and The Tijuana Brass.Admittedly - I'm rating this 3 stars because I HAVE to provide a rating. I haven't decided whether or not to return it yet, so it remains unopened."
5,"A truly exciting, couldn't-put-it-down book",The story grabs your attention from the first page and just keeps getting more and more interesting and exciting till you feel you just have to keep reading to the very end.
5,Great Grinder,"We already bought more than 10 of these grinders and they are the best value for the $$$ you pay.Previoulsly used Metabo, Makita, DeWalt but none can compare with Bosch.Highly recomend it."
4,1018ps,"We have 5 of these in the shop and they are very good grinder. They can take the abuse of running for hours. The paddle switch is nice in case it binds into a corner or trys to kick back at you.It is comfortable to hold on to for a while. I don't know what the life span of these are IF they are treated nice but in the shop we get about a year of abuse out of them before the bearings start to make noise and it starts to shake in your hands and eventually just locks up.Make no mistake though we are hard on them. They get dropped, soaked with machine coolant and we weld by them. If I didn't already have a grinder I would buy this Bosch."
4,Where's the case?,"I was a little taken aback by the size of the box this thing came in--turns out Bosch doesn't think grinders need to be put away and skimped on the case. This makes little sense to me given what tends to happen when a grinding wheel isn't stored properly, but maybe I'm crazy.The grinder itself is solidly built and the gradual speed up keeps it from jumping out of your hand nicely. The safety on the switch is a great feature to prevent against accidents, but I find it a little tricky to hit with gloves on; same with the lock-on button and spindle lock. Guard adjustments are simple and tool-free at least, and there's plenty of power to go 'round.It would have been nice if they had incorporated their anti-kickback circuit into this model, too. I don't need or want a bigger, heavier grinder, but I would like one that won't hit me in the face."
5,solid tool,"I believe for use in the home shop and many commercial requirements, this tool is superb. I have used it for paint removal with a cup brush with good results. Using the rubber backer wheel I hogged the side of several small logs. It was up for the job. the power is there and delivered with not too much noise. I did not find the Bosch 1810 to be too heavy for long use, and the paddle switch was an integral part of the grip."
5,Quality and Power,I love Bosch tools and this one is another winner. I wanted a paddle switch after my last grinder snagged my work shirt and cooked the brushes. This is a great safety feature. The motor has ample power.
4,Good angle grinder,"Works nicely, seems well-built. I would have liked clearer instructions about the rpm adjustments (some discs require higher rpms, some less). I've used one other brand of angle grinder, and this is far superior.EDITAfter 1.5 years of using this angle grinder, I'm even happier with it than before. I've done a whole variety of jobs now from steel brushing paint off concrete to grinding and cutting metal, and have a project lined up for cutting tile and some stone. The paddle switch is very convenient and a nice safety feature, and the ergonomics make the machine much easier to use than some others I've tried. Great tool for the long-term."
3,Norma in Colorado,"I nearly didnt finish this book as it was a little hard to get into. The first part reminds me of someone writing mind chatter. It was disorienting to me. There was enough good though that I kept reading and am glad I did. It is filled with ""That's the way I feel, or I wish I could say it that way"" type of writing. Stick with it. It ends up a good read."
3,yellow aztec - star lamp,Product was not shipped with the cord & bulb holder. After calling the company they made it right & sent the cord immediately.
5,the best!!!,This is the BEST way to get my calcium and have a taste treat mid-morning and mid-afternoon! Highly recommend this product.
3,Great BUT,"The Midsomer Murders Series is so good! Great acting, great characterizations and great mysteries. They have recoved what America lost - believable and credible characters you like even with their flaws. But do they have to spend so much time on sex and homosexuality. I guess the only reason the population isn't going down in the area from all the multiple murders is the incredible numbers of affairs and births without the benefits of marriage!"
5,Life Changing!,"In todays world of throw away marriages, this book forces the reader to take another look at the true meaning of marriage and commitment. It provides a better understanding of why the marriage vow to ""love and to cherish"" ""for better or for worse"" is meant to be so much more than just a legal contract between two people.Though written from a Christian perspective, the book offers hope for any marriage that is at risk of been ripped apart by neglect, selfishness or adultery. It is also a great resource for those that may want to restore a marriage already devastated by divorce.The book was written from a woman's perspective, but I found it insightful and very helpful in evaluating my own role as a husband and a father.If you're looking for a way to heal your marriage, this book is a great place to start."
3,Give us something new!,"This is OK, but nothing new, as usual. I have been a JJ fan for 40+ years, but it's really difficult to spend money on his stuff when there is so little new material. I guess as he mellowed, his creative juices dwindled. This is all stuff that's been out there but is worthwhile if you don't have much of his stuff."
1,"Too weak, flexible, and fussy!","I picked up a couple of these on a whim while running errands at the Borg. Seemed like a handy and simple idea. I have tried to use them quite a few times but have yet to find anything at which they excel. They actually clamp with less pressure than your hand can exert. The ratchet slips often, especially when you happen to pick up the clamp with it on the top handle. The rotating pads are more of a hassle than an advantage. They often rotate out of position, making it more of a 3 hand clamp than a 1 hand clamp, and also make the clamps essentially unusable on round objects.Buy large spring clamps instead. They cost less, clamp harder, and work more reliably.I am a real fan of Quik Grip clamps, so this worthless product really took me by surprise. They need to pull it off the market."
5,Does the Job,I roll out big rolls of material and then have to cut it. These clamps fit the job to hold the material so it won't move when I have to go back and forth to build layers of material to cut through.
4,Great catch if you got it the first time around!,"Great figures, brought me back to my childhood. There is just one problem I have. Why is it taking so long to get a new shippment to Amazon? I had only ordered one set to see how they were. I received them and was really amazed at the detail and work put into these figures. I went to order another set two days later and they were already gone. That was in October of last year! Come on, get in some more! This is a set that anyone who likes Batman or a figure collector should have. A little pricey but worth it. If they come out again, pick them up. You'll be glad you did."
3,leaves a lot to be desired.,"too many vertially unsolveable puzzles. limited to a single character. Even with a hint book I was unable to complete sections, and finally gave up and moved on to another game."
5,I thought this CD was horribly underrated!!!,"This is a great CD in my opinion. I especially liked ""A Little In Love,"" ""I Believe You,"" ""We Are The One,"" and my favorite on the CD was ""Start Forever Over Again."" I thought it was a good CD from start to finish. This was better than his first CD in terms of his songwriting. He was done a huge injustice when this CD didn't sell well in the United States. He is just as good as one of his Canadian counterparts, Terri Clark, and infinitely better then the inane Shania Twain. His third album will give him another chance to prove that he is much more than a one album wonder. By the way, I have it, and I suggest to all true country music fans, GET IT! You won't regret it."
2,How is this game not below Night Trap?,"Night trap was considered one of the worst games of all time, but at least its enjoyable to play. If House of the Dead wasn't a good first person zombie shooter, it would be this game. Everything is in FMV and the acting along with the graphics aren't even good. As you go along the game it is really repetitive shooting the zombies and it moves really choppy. As soon as you complete a stage you get treated to more cut scenes of the actors talking about surviving the zombies. They also made this one for the 32x, 3DO and Sega Saturn which show the video much larger and less grainy, but that alone couldn't save this game."
5,A not so bad game,This game isn't too bad I'm not going to say it's the best game ever made but it's not bad for a Full Motion Video game. It has a great story line and it's a little hard. I would would say it's better then some Full motion video games. It's a game worth playing i played it and got sucked in the storyline and the villain is a cool villain but that's what makes the game cool. Some of it is funny too. For Full motion video fans out there this would be a good game for you.
3,Disappointed with this product,I recently purchased this router and within days of receiving it tried it out cutting mortise and tenons. While many of the features were nice I found the accuracy and ruggedness of the router to be lacking. The plunging action was fine except that the bit will move off of perpendicular due to lack of rigidity in the plunge mechanism and the rods the router moves on. I also own a Hitachi M12V and do not have a bit of problem with its plunging accuracy. I noticed this when I was using the router on my new Leigh mortise and tenon fixture. I have since put my Hitachin back on the jig fixture and am back in business.Other features like the soft start are very nice. The micro adjust is ok but somewhat stiff to set. I have not spent much time looking at this feature and will see if I missed something in the instruction manual. The machine works fine as a pattern cutter and I have decided to keep it since I need a router for run of the mill operations.
3,Good but not Great,"This is a fine router but has some major shortcomings despite all the accolades expressed by other users. First, the plunge action could be a lot smoother.Springs are much too rigid for smooth action. Second, it has no built - in dust collection system. The manuals say that an attachment is available,but it is nearly impossible to find one in stores or on the web. A router by it's very nature is a very messy operation and to have no built in dust collector and no easily obtainable attachment is a serious drawback. Lastly, because of the rather rough plunge action some accuracy is sacrificed. This is not a good tool for overall moulding or fine furniture making."
1,Ron cch,I ordered this product over a month ago. I got an email saying it is on backorder and it will be a couple of weeks. I never recieved this item.
5,Look no further for a book on annuals,"This is THE book you'll need on annuals. I've been looking for two years for one that sorts flowers by use and growing conditions and tells you everything you need to know. Others make all annuals sound like they'll be successful in your situation. But as someone who strictly grows only annuals (I have a rooftop garden), even treating flowers according to directions in other books doesn't always work. This book will save you money in the end. Buy it!!!!"
4,ANNUALS FOR EVERY PURPOSE,"WHILE I LOVED HODGSON'S PERENNIALS FOR EVERY PURPOSE, I FIND THE ANNUALS FOR EVERY PURPOSE BOOK A LITTLE LESS HELPFUL, BUT WOULD STILL RATE IT A 3.5-4. THERE ARE LOTS OF PICTURES OF THE ANNUALS, BUT MOST OF THEM ARE CLOSE UPS...SOME OF THE CLOSE UP PICTURES YOU LOOK AT AND SAY ""WHILE I KNOW THAT IS THE CORRECT ANNUAL, IT REALLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT FROM A DISTANCE OR IN THE GARDEN"". HOWEVER, THE SECTIONS FOR EACH ANNUAL ENTITLED ""PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS"" ""GOOD NEIGHBORS"" AND ""TOP PERFORMER"" ARE STILL HELPFUL....HOWEVER, I AM STILL LOOKING FOR A BETTER ANNUAL BOOK... LANSING, ILLINOIS"
5,Great Book!,Received this book in a very timely mannor and I am enjoying it very much! It has alot of good information in it.
3,Small Legos needed,"I did not realize that the little people would fit only the very small legos. Grandchildren had the larger legos, so I will be buying the smaller ones to fit the gift. The children did like the characters and found some other ways to play with them."
5,Great addition for preschoolers!,i bought this for my preshool department and when I opened the package I was thrilled. These are really neat additions and the children love them. I would definitely buy these again.
5,Great for the toddlers,"Great product from Lego. The little dolls do not disassemble creating risk for toddlers, it is colorful, funny and kids loved."
5,Great,My grandson has fun with these little people. These are great for him to build different buildings or anything he wants without having to take some apart.
5,Perfect for the lil peeps in your life!,Got this set for my 2 year old niece and she loves them. Stuffs the little people in her purse wherever she goes! The set of world people demonstrates the diversity that I hope all children learn as they grow up!
5,Love it but disappointed,I was very excited waiting for these little guys to arrive for my 15 month old grand-daughter but when they did arrive I was very disappointed to find we did not get a whole set. We received two duplicate bags of the same one family and the rest were miss-matched as though they ran out of the set so tossed in a hand full of what was laying around to meet the quantity requirement. Will be sending them back to get a new set.
1,OUTDATED!,"I was all excited about this book, especially after reading the reviews. Boy, was I disappointed!!!!!!! This book is not only written with MEN ONLY in mind (all referenced made to men, pics of menswear, etc.), it must've been written at least FORTY YEARS ago. There are so many references to triple-ply 70's polyester and hippies, it seems horribly out of date and out of touch in the year 2008. The author keeps going around in circles about ""you are what you wear, you are what you wear"", but makes no startling revelations. I think it comes down to common sense: dress well, get treated with more respect - dress shabby and get treated as such (depending on your circumstances, of course.) I read half of this book and can take no more; it's going in the circular bin, if you know what I mean."
1,Stay Away,"OMG....save your money. However, if your looking for a 'sleep aid' this blu-ray certainly does the trick. Watch this for 2 mins and you will be asleep.Menu doesn't work, you can only start playback by selecting a chapter. Audio is in German.3D isn't that good."
1,Don't buy this disc,"I agree with all the other 1-star reviews. The disc has a defect in the menu programming that makes it unplayable except by selecting a scene. You can't change the language from German. I can't comment on the content as I wasn't able to get past the menu problem. I returned one disc for a replacement, the second for a refund. Save yourself a couple of trips to the Post Office and don't buy it in the first place. It's a shame Amazon requires a minimum of 1 star, since it doesn't even deserve that."
1,Great Expectations Gone Awry,"What a great idea for a 3D blu-ray, Amazing Nature! Sadly my experience wasn't a good one as the Menu doesn't work on the blu-ray for either the 2D or 3D versions. The movie was only accessible via the 'Scenes' which I find unacceptable."
1,DOOOOOOOOOOOOO Not Buy,"i had a very hard time to get this dvd to play. when it did play what a piece of junk, 3d. i didnt see any and its in german, pass on this one its not worth five cents...."
1,VERY disappointed !,"Same problems as Cliff S. and the rest of the reviewers. Could not change the main menu selections, nor get it to play in English.I now notice that there is a new release date on this disk? ""This title will be released on November 23, 2012"" What's up with this ?Gotta find out how to return this disk......"
2,problems with playback - you can do it.,"Yes, the disc will not play in the usual manner as most of the controls do not work. However, we foundthat if you go to chapters and opt for chapter one - the disc will play with the German soundtrack. YouCAN use your remote by using the audio button to change to English.The 3D in the final half of the disc is quite good with much forward imaging.So try this. It worked for us quite well. Yes, a pain. But it did work and we saw the entiredisc in English and 3D."
1,Disc Does Not Play - Default Is German Soundtrack,"I have two different 3D DVD players and this disc would not play at all in one and in the other 3D player I was only able to get disc to play using the scene selection function. Also, the soundtrack is defaulted to German.I can understand why they made this disc not to play...when I was able to watch the content, this has to be the most boring nature DVD I have seen. There are a few decent 3D scenes but the narrative and information is so dull and mundane. It is slow and very drawn between scenes and narrative.Overall, I just don't recommend this DVD for its faulty software production as well as its lacking content."
2,Amazing Nature 3D,"Couldn't play it, didnt work at all. Only chapers worked, and not in English, was in german. No good to me as could not play it. you click on Play nothing happens......none of the buttons on remote worked. Didn't look like good movie judging from chapters i clicked onto. Thought it was movie on horses? Wrong. Looked boring."
1,Disappointing,Scene selection was neutral at best. Worst part of my experiences (I returned first disc) was that neither disc consistently played from the poorly designed menu.
1,"graphics were good, but could not under stand it.i","I could not get the audio in english. we dont speak german, so it was hard to follow.I would have enjoyedit if i knew what they were talking about."
1,menu malfunction twice,I have a blu ray player.I could not get past the main menu to get this video to PLay in either 2d or 3d. Amazon sent me another copy and I had the same result.I have played a dozen or so other dvds in both 2d and 3d in my player with no problem.
1,Defective product,"Never did see this movie, since it would not respond to the play command. To much bother to send it back. That's the downside of ordering by mail."
1,Disc Does Not Play!,"The same as the other one star reviews. Menu doesn't work, you can only start playback by selecting a chapter. Audio is in German by default and can only be changed via the remote."
1,Doesn't Play,"Don't buy it. Sent 1st one back because it wouldn't play, the 2nd one only played in German. The few minutes I watched looked boring anyway. Terrible product."
2,nice dvd in german,"We all enjoyed the pictures , but did not understand too much of the german narrator . Maybe there is some kind of setting i missed ?"
5,Are there no beatle fans who own this to review?!,"Can't Believe I am the first to review this and I'm not a HUGE beatle fan altho who can not like them. This one is a must for all beatle fans and surprised its this low in cost but now that I have put this out there, it is sure the low price won't last long!"
1,CHEAP,These earrings are so thin and fragile that I don't wear them very often PLUS they are really big. Not very happy with these.
2,The worst of the tasty bite meals.,"I eat the h3ll out of tasty bites, and this is the worst one. It's 95% bamboo shoots and the whole thing smells like pee. And I love tasty bites and curry. I gave it two stars because it's still edible, if you're in to bamboo shoots or pee."
4,Propane guage,"This product seems to do exactly as it is supposed to. I like the saftey feature and especially knowing when I need to refill propane, rather than running out during a cook out."
1,Hazzard,Bought two of these. On one the face plate to the guage cracked releasing gas. The other completely blew the face off leaking gas. These are hazzardous.
2,Never got video,"This toy was supposed to have a video. I had it shipped to my daughter and she didn't realize it, so we never sent it back, however if the video is available I would like to have it. So that is why I gave 2 stars only part of the shipment came."
1,"Not written for couples, written for people treating couples.","This book is written to train doctors who treat couples for sexual issues that arise in marriage. My wife and I have tried to read this book together, it goes so deep into the history of sex and uses words that only a doctor would get. I am sure that this is a very good book and I will continue to read it. For people having issues in their marriage, I don't recommend this book, it is to hard to follow. It spends the first three chapters putting you to sleep. I am still in search of a book that will help my wife and I get things working again. If anyone really liked this book, I am sorry if I upset or offended you."
3,Too mental for me,"Although I am a medical doctor and consider myself to be average in intelligence, this book put me to sleep. There is so much theory and scientific information that it put me, a physician, to sleep. There are some parts that deserve merit and some insights that are useful but you have to read a large amount of material that seems amazingly boring to get to it. I would not recommend this book. I have read 100 pages so far and it has been hard to continue reading more. I will make an effort to finish it and report to you later. Maybe there is a surprise somewhere ahead of these pages"
3,"refreshing, inspirational, good solid teaching on prayer",I found the book most inspiring. My child loved the outcome and discovering that God loved him too!. Now he's really into praying and I am pleased!
4,Great Children's First Book of Prayer,"A wonderfully simple, yet very meaningful, board book. While advertised for children of 1 to 3 years of age, the language is fairly simple and will appeal to children up to the age of 6 or 7 years. This book teaches toddlers and youngsters to thank God for their parents, homes, friends, to ask for God's protection for family, the ill, and even our pets, and finally delivers a message of living harmoniously with all the world's children, ""like sisters and like brothers."" The illustrations are delightful, with many details of interest to children. My child often enjoys spending time simply finding various objects in the coloful pictures. Highly recommended for any parent wishing to interest their youngster in how we relate to God."
3,Got this because I'm an SRK fan,I got this only because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. I only care to see the part when Shah Rukh Khan is in it.
5,Another Great Album To Introduce Kids To Jazz,"If you're interested in getting children into jazz, this CD is a fabulous introduction. Every kid out there knows the theme to the Pink Panther, and as soon as the first tone is struck, most know what's coming. The dancing and fun that ensues is pretty enjoyable, too. Moody's vocal on ""Don't You Forget It"" is an easily remembered song, as well, one that they'll be singing verbatim in no time."
3,Great video for those interested in dub music,"This video (that also includes a CD with all the music in the video), depicts an amazing musician and his achievements. The photography does not have the best quality, most of the video is dark and the rest of the musicians are always in the background. The title of this video says ""Lee Scratch meets Mad Professor"", but I did not see Mad Professor anywhere, maybe is one of those musicians left in the background. The best in this DVD is the sound quality (it even has the Dolby 5.1 option) and the music. Lee Scratch is one of my favorites musicians in dub/reggae, it mixes all kind of sounds to create extraordinary songs, they can take you from the mood to the extasis. Something funny about this video is that Lee Perry is smoking weed along footage, you may feel the smell of weed in your living room."
3,Not Great,"Although this book is packed with great songs, they indicate some really bad chord changes. I also have The Praise & Worship Fake Book published by Hal Leonard that I love. The arrangements are terrific and the keys are perfect. I was expecting the same with the Praise & Worship Song Book but was very disappointed. Besides the bad chords, the songs are also written in higher keys, and while I can play what is written decently, I'm not good at playing in a lower key than what is written. This does have a few additional good songs that are not included in the book I love, but had I known the problems beforehand, I probably would not have purchased it for the price I paid. It wasn't worth it to me, but knowing the problems, it might be to you."
4,"Great for adolescent ""thinkers""...","Jason Bock forms a group of fellow teen ""worshippers"" of a water tower, with all but one of the group going along for fun. Shin, Jason's best friend, becomes a true believer, while Jason struggles with his own atheistic feelings. This story is a good blend of philosophical exploration and fairly well paced action. Anyone with the most modest fear of heights will be riveted. The writing is clean and direct and Hautman does well at getting inside the adolescent male brain.However, as often happens in juvenile lit, the mother figure is unsympathetic. In this case, Jason's mother is a hypochondriac by proxy, always convinced that Jason has a serious disease; his father is more positively portrayed. In fact, Jason's father becomes the primary catalyst of Jason's spiritual journey. Why does it seem necessary in this genre to have the adolescent characters' motivation in part driven by mother dysfunction?Buy this book for those adolescent and even adult ""thinkers""..."
4,Can a watertower be God?,"I was looking for book recommendations one night, and someone mentioned that, though it was a book for young adults, it was still worth the read. So, I went down to my library and picked up a copy.Overall, the book was well-written and the story was fun. I wanted to keep reading to see what was going to happen next. The author worked in some actual religious history into the book, which I appreciated.The book also raises some of the issues with the theistic conception of God. That being said, this isn't some atheistic book written to persuade young readers to abandon their faiths, but it does raise some problems that all theists must deal with."
3,Book was average,It was a average book. The story line was interesting but seem better for a youth reader. I do enjoy youth novels but this one seem to not attract me as something I would pick up again.
4,Excellent for teens who are thinking about religion,"This book is about a boy, Jason, who on a whim starts his own religion worshipping a new god - the town's water tower. Other kids join this religion for different reasons, with different levels of commitment. Jason struggles to keep the religion pure and the townspeople and their parents start to be aware of what the kids are doing.Jason is very bright, and he has some interesting points about religion to make. As time goes by, he feels like he's lost control of his creation and that bothers him. If you've ever thought that all religions were stupid, this is a book you should read. It does NOT take a position of being either for or against ANY religion. It does examine why different people want something in their life, and the reasons why they want a religion to fill that need.This would be a good book for a bright kid who is starting to think about religion in general - it may help them clarify their own opinions and thoughts."
4,More proof that the best artists never get airplay,"If you think the best records are the ones that get played on the radio and/or win Grammies, then you are WAY off. Trynin has released yet another wonderful pop-rock record, only to be dropped by her record label in favor of ""better selling"" artists. But the label's loss is our, well, it's our loss too. Trynin is as talented a guitarist as she is a singer and songwriter. She's the whole package. Pick up this record before it disappears into oblivion completely. Its hard enough to find good music anymore. Don't miss your chance on this one. Why ANYONE listens to the radio anymore is beyond me. ALL of the best stuff still sits languishing in the CD bins, unheard by the the general public's ears.Or then again, you can buy just the radio hits and continue to be a part of the problem."
1,"Not a commercial success, but some dedicated fans ...........","The idea of parallel universes doesn't seem so crazy while looking at all the 4 and 5 star reviews here. I don't doubt that people love this album, but why? Her voice is thin, although there is one octave towards the lower end that is passable. But she insists on singing high where her voice is not merely weak and whiny, but simply unattractive.And then there are the lyrics. She opens ""Under The Knife"" with ""I think it's the time to make my tits flow like wine"". And she all but closes the opener ""Go Ahead"" with ""I'd grab a bottle and a shed then we could do it in a hedge"". I'm sure she thought she was communicating something important in those words (all the words of every song are on the inside of the back insert). I just can't work out what it is."
2,May not fit your Bosch router,"I bought the Bosch 1617EVSPK router kit last December and this dust extraction kit last week. BEWARE that if your Bosch router is fairly new and has a fine adjustment shaft that goes into the base of the fixed base (model RA1161 I think), the side dust extraction hood in this kit will NOT fit. Bosch recently redesigned the fixed router base and is aware of the problem with fitting their existing dust hood on this base. They say they will release a modified dust extractor hood kit ""in a few months"". I cannot comment on the performance of the other hood as I'm selling my kit to my brother-in-law and waiting on the redesigned hoods to be released. Check your fixed router base for an extended shaft before purchasing this kit.***UPDATE 6/08***I repurchased this item and they've redesigned it so that it now fits."
4,Bosch Dust Hoods,"In addition to the Bosch router table, I bought the Bosch router kit with plunge and fixed bases, the dust collection kit, and the fixed base which is made specifically for attaching to the router table.Routers spew a lot of shavings and dust, so capturing the mess at the source saves lots of time cleaning up. Although the router table has a built-in dust collection hood, it only captures the dust that spews out above the surface of the table. Since one of the Bosch router accessory dust hoods attaches to the fixed base under the table, I thought it would be great to attach it, thus collecting dust from both above and below the table surface. Alas, I couldn't accomplish this because the table stand obstructs attaching the accessory hood when that base is attached to the table.So far, neither Bosch nor any other manufacturer has devised a simple tool-less quick change collet for inserting and removing router bits. I look forward to that day."
2,Meh. Not so great.,"I used this with my router combined with thePorter-Cable 4216 Super Jig - Dovetail jig (4215 With Mini Template Kit). I have to say I was less than impressed. The sawdust output was a bit diminished, but not significantly. Also, the addition of a vacuum hose made the router harder to handle. The hose almost pulled my router off line several times.Perhaps if you had a shop-central vacuum system this would work better. It ended up being more aggravation than it was worth in this application.I still hope to test it out on some other applications, such as edge routing. Maybe I'll be able to arrange the hose so it pulls less.If I had to buy it again, I'd probably save my money."
1,dissapointment,"Do not buy this unless you want to remake it so it will work. The dust hood for the fixed base just barely fits and if you are using it for a router table it will not fit unless you seriously rework it . I had to cut the outfeed tube off and turn it 90 degrees and super glue it back on, in order to make it fit under the router table top. Like I said don't buy this unless you want to do some serious tweeking on it. The dust hood for the plunge base router is even worse. the mounting holes won't align and the way it is made, it is seriously in the way of your work.You would be better off just to take your work outside instead of trying to keep the mess off your shop floor. Overall I was glad I didn't a lot for this junk."
5,Must have!,Routers send out ridiculous dust so this is a no brainer. I use the one that hooks onto the main body of the router for most jobs (as opposed to the other one included in the kit that mounts to the bottom of the non-marring base for edge routing).
4,Very good effort,"Personally, I didn't think that this album was as good as her exceptional CD, Mask and the Mirror. However, it's still better than anything else being offered today. Definitely worth getting."
4,"Wonderful, Wonderful","Wonderful to listen to, though I like ""The Visit"" even more. A great mix of world sounds which touches something deep inside."
3,3 good songs and a lot of crosscultural noodling.,"The best reason for buying this CD is The Highwayman, which will send shivers down your spine! The Mummers Dance and Dante's Prayer are also good, but I found the remaining tracks rather bland and unfocused, and not as ""deep"" as they were trying to be."
5,Soul Enriching Music,Lorenna's album deviates from traditional Celtic Style andadds an Middle Eastern Style. She has a vocal style which is similiar to Enya. I enjoyed listening to ever song on thealbum. This album definitely has smooth melodic vibe to it and is one of her best albums. I recommend this album to anyone who has an appreaciation for all kinds of music.
3,Celtic music lovers,"Perhaps now as well known as the Celtic Woman CD's, this is refreshing and relaxing music, but takes a bit of listening to. It is mystical, lyrical, weaving lore into a musical setting."
5,It is pleasurable to the ear as it is to the mind.,"When I heard ""The Mummers Dance"" I fell in love the loreena McKennit's music. It was enchanting and just plain peaceful. I love it and it deserves everyone of the five stars it gets and many people agree with me."
5,Lorennas Celtic Sounds are fabulous,The combination of Celtic based music mixed with a haunting world sound is beyond imagination. The use of so many differnet instruments makes this a wonderful wordly blend of colors tostir the imagination and Lorenna McKennitts voice is sweeping over it all. If you like Enya this beats it all together.
5,her best work,"Truly a stunning album. Her faux-mystical, faux-Celtic rhythms are both highly derivative yet manage to create a completely original sound, unlike anything else that was on the market at the time. Highly recommended for a candle-lit bath!"
5,Book of Secrets by Loreena McKennitt,This is my introduction to Loreena McKennitt and I loved it. I cried while listening to The Highwayman. I lived the lyrics and the music brought me to the scene.
5,The Secret is Out,"I've worn out more copies of this CD than I can remember. I keep one at home, one in my car, one in my truck! I really can't wait to get my enhanced CD of ""The Book of Secrets""! Also looking forward to listening to ""An Ancient Muse"". ""The Book of Secrets"" is a remarkable work. If anyone enjoys music that is original, artistic, & intelligent, you can get this CD, and do yourself a tremedous favor!"
5,So Unique You Cannot Classify Her Work,"Here's a lady whose work is so unique as to render itself unclassifiable (if that's a word??). It's so original and she does it so well!! Is it old english? Is it Celtic? Is it arabic/eastern/something? Me, I don't really care. I just LOVE to listen to it! She's one of the great originals. That's all. ;->"
5,Midevil,"I first heard The Murmmer's Dance on a Commercial for the movie Ever After and after investigating I found Loreena's C.D. I LOVE IT, it's wonderful, angelic, and midevil songs just gives it something no other singer has! Not only do I love the Mummer's Dance I love all the other songs as well! Just try it!"
3,Relaxing music but a little to slow and repetative,If your a fan of Enya's slower pieces then you may like this album. The music is relaxing and somewhat spiritual but did not stir my soul very much. I prefer music with a little more energy.
1,Depression you seek for,"THE CD YOU ARE ALL DREAMING OF COULD BE THE DOOR TO DEPRESSION,IF YOU ARE SOMEONE LIKE ME,WHO USED TO LAUGH A LOT ,BEFORE LISTENING TO THIS.IF YOU REACH FOR TRUE DEPRESSION THAT WOULD FORCE YOU TO SEE THE WORLD HROUGH THE EYES OF A PESSIMISTIC PERSON RECOMMEND ""DEAD CAN DANCE"".Y ADVICE IS, IF YOUR FATE DICTATES YOU TO BUY IT,DON'T LISTEN TO IT OFTEN."
3,Mediocre,"This album in no way compares to her other albums. I would title this the ""popular music"" album. She used to be totally original with her adaptations of celtic songs. Now every piece seems to be the same. She appears to be trying to reach a larger audience and in doing so she has lost some of her focus."
2,Ethereal and thought-provoking,"I thought her album had some very interesting themes. ""Mummer's Dance"" and ""Dante's Prayer"" stand out as a couple of examples. Her style is similar to Irish singers Enya and Maire Brenan and Austrailian singer Michelle Tumes. I enjoyed it because it is ""intelligent"" music and not that disposable pop music that is so prevalant in Top 40 radio."
5,JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND THINK OF IRELAND,"If you close your eyes and think of Ireland, while playing this c.d, you'll probably want to cry. I'm only sixteen, but this has to be the best c.d i've ever bought (and ive bought alot). And, if youve got some Irish blood in you, and you ve always wanted to go to Ireland,or maybe you have, this is the one for you, i promise."
4,"Enchanting, mystifying, ethereal.","I have to admit that Book of Secrets did not speak to me the way The Visit did. I still enjoyed it, but this disk has a more Middle Eastern flavor to it that the Celtic nuance of The Visit. It is still worth a listen, but be aware that it is different from her previous work."
5,Haunting and Beautiful,"I came across this album after hearing ""The Mummer's Dance"" on the radio one day. After about a minute of the song, I knew I had to have this album. I picked it up the next day and have cherished it ever since. McKennitt's vocals are haunting and sweet. The melodies are mysterious and exotic, yet relaxing as well. My favorite track is ""The Highwayman."" The best time to listen to this CD is when you've had a long day and need some relaxation time. Close your eyes and let it surround you. My favorite way to relax to this album is in the bath tub with lots of candles!"
3,Pretty Good But She's no Sarah Mclachlan,It only has three hits. This CD will take some getting used to. You could go either way with this one.
2,I guess I just dont get it,"Well, someone had to break the streak. I bought this disc totally on the fact that everyone reviewing it gave it 5 stars. In the past I have lived by a rule - never buy a disc or album without listening to a few songs. I guess I need to start following my rule again.Sorry folks, but I just dont see it. Those of you who compared this to Enya seem to me to be way off the mark. I found none of the same ethereal sounds or likeable melodies I have come to expect from Enya on this album. It all struck me as tired and forced, not natural.I'll keep listening, maybe I'll come around and see whatever it is the rest of you see in it, but after six or seven listens, I'm liking this album less every time I hear it.Maybe my expectations were too high?...."
2,Was she singing or was a cat in heat?,"The two best songs on the album are The Mummer's Dance and Marco Polo. As for the rest... To be kind, I'd say she's better when she speaks to the music rather than actually sings. Almost the entire album is whining pseudo-Centic twaddle.Most of the reviews point out how McKennitt spreads out from the Celtic roots and embraces other styles on this album. Other than Marco Polo, not really.After a while it becomes music to slit your wrists to."
3,Little goes a long way,"This is a pretty overrated album. The singer is OK, and so is the material if taken in small enough doses. Taken full strength it is dull, depressing celtic elevator music. If you must buy it, put it in your mp3 collection and 'shuffle' it in with some better music (Miriam Stockley, Grey Eye Glances, Porcupine Tree, Jethro Tull jump to mind) and it will provide a semi-nice mix, but taken on it's own it bombs. Better yet, pass on this one."
5,the murmmers dance,"""the murmmers dance"" is a very ethoric song. it reaks of sprituality, and takes me to a place 'inside' where i prefer to be.it is a awesom"
5,Music From Heaven!!!!!!!!!,"What can I possibly add to what the other reviewers have already said? I had to drive across town in the rain at rush hour and I put this CD on in the car - I was sorry when the trip ended! Beautiful, magical, soothing, though my smart alec husband says it makes him want to dance around an oak tree in the moonlight. My favorites: The Mummers Dance, the divine Marco Polo, the thrilling Night Ride Across the Caucasus. If there is a heaven, this is the kind of music you will, hopefully, hear there. GO OUT AND GET IT RIGHT NOW! PLEASE!"
5,Loreena McKennitt Is a Star,"Another tremendous offering from a lady with a mystical, magical voice. I never tire of listening to her melodies, and the bonus DVD with this CD is a classic.I would highly recommend this CD to any celtic music fan who hasn't sampled Loreena'a yet."
3,One masterpiece and a couple of good ones,"After Enya, Norah Jones and Yanni, the roster of New Age musicians becomes decidely less famous. One popular New Age artist is Loreena McKennitt. Her music, like her ancestry, is Celtic though many of the themes are reminescent of Enya. Her most famous work is The Mummer's Dance, a staple of pop radio stations in the late 1990s, and the feature work on this album. The other works are also good, but none as great as The Mummer's Dance. The album itself only has eight works, making this a short album for the purchase price. Each of the works are unique, some are instrumental while others include singing. The music is appropriate background music while reading or eating dinner. Overall, an OK album."
2,Good melodies but no development,"Many of the songs have some nice melodic ideas, but they run about twice as long as they should with no development, just repetition. A very weak sister to early Enya recordings."
2,not for me,"I went to an outdoor concert where Loreena Mckennit was playing. It was a beautiful moonlit night, the stars were carpeting the sky, and HER DARN SONG WENT ON FOR EVER! I mean it was endless. Since then, I have no patience for her music. (with all due respect with what seems to be fairly appreciative fans . . .)"
5,Pan Celtic Secrets,"As a fellow ""World Cross-Over Music Artist"", I have to say first of all, Congratulations Loreena! You are truly an musical inspiration to other composers and performers around the world. I personally find great motivation and inspiration through your Pan Celtic explorations in ""The Book of Secrets"". Well Done!!!- Brent Gunter- Guitarist & Composer on ""Andalucia"""
5,This album will speak to your soul...,"Loreena McKennitt is one of my favorite artists. ""The Book of Secrets"" is a wonderful variety of sounds from the haunting strains of ""Prologue"" to the irresistibly rhythmic ""Marco Polo."" All of the tracks are well-constructed musically, and the Middle Eastern influence gives her Celtic-inspired music a special flair. I particularly enjoyed ""The Mummers' Dance"" and the heartbreaking story of the wandering monk set to the soul-deep music of ""Skellig."" ""Dante's Prayer"" is such a beautiful piece; the first time I heard it, it moved me to tears.If you are trying to decide whether or not you want to add this CD to your collection, let me say in no uncertain terms that you should do so immediately. You will not be sorry. It is a brilliant effort by McKennitt, worth every penny and then some."
5,Quite a surprise...,"I was seeking the Soundtrack to the movie ""Soldier"" because I was looking for a captivating piece that I heard in it. When I found the Soundtrack, the piece I heard was not on it.Through another reviewer who was looking for the same thing, I discovered ""The Book of Secrets"" Which had this piece and others equally enchanting in it.I bought this album and two others and I have not been disappointed as Mckennitt has a lovely voice, but I also enjoy the instrumentals I found as well."
3,Good Kettle - Sick Whistle,The kettle is great and sure looks good. The whistle needs a lot to be desired as it is just too soft to hear at any distance away.
1,Worst tea kettle ever! And dangerous!,"Seriously - I've purchased a million things on Amazon and this product was by far the worst. You could scald yourself just trying to open the overly stiff spout, let alone trying to remove the lid, which feels like it was hammered into place. This product should be RECALLED! If you value your skin and the skin of your loved ones, don't buy this product! Le Creuset should be ashamed of themselves for putting this thing on the market, and Amazon should be ashamed for listing it. By the way, I wouldn't have given this thing any stars if I wasn't required to in order to submit this review."
1,Unreliable Whistle! Fire Hazard!,"I owned two of these kettles. Right out of the box the whistle was not reliable. Sometimes it would work and sometimes it wouldn't. That is fine, I thought, as long as you live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment and are always close enough to hear the water boil if the whistle fails. But then I moved to a bigger place and I have burned two of these kettles since.Why would you bother buying a tea kettle without a reliable whistle? You might as well just save the money and wait in the kitchen while you boil water in a regular pot.Don't buy this product! This Le Creuset kettle is a fire hazard and should be taken off the market. Even you might forget to remember one day that you had some water boiling for tea, and before you know it your apartment goes up in flames"
5,I absolutely love my new Le Creuset Teakettle,"This items is, without a doubt, hands down, everything I expected and much much more! I couldn't be happier! Thanks so much!"
1,the WORST teakettle ever,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. My roommate purchased this ridiculously expensive teakettle and there are little black flecks floating around in the hot water. This item should not be sold and is hazardous.I also had the same experience with Le Creuset's customer service. Their lifetime warranty is a joke. Instead of spending money on shipping the item to be ""inspected"" I'm going to buy a decent teakettle instead. What a crappy product from such an expensive line."
5,WOW - This is a great CD!,"The title about sums it up. The composers did a magnificent job, the pieces are great. But the musicians! Oh, they are inspired!"
2,Dwight Yoakam's worst album to date!,"I am a very big Dwight Yoakam fan, but this album was truly disappointing. The album contained no original songs and was merely a project of covers of other artists hits. The only reason I give it the two stars I did is because it's a Dwight Yoakam record. ""Baby Don't Go"" was a good duet with Sheryl Crow, but it's still not worth the admission price. North to Alaska seemed out of place and added nothing to the project. The entire album lacked direction and focus. It's not a bad record overall, but for Dwight it's a great disappointment. He is such a talented writer and it is sad that he had to rely on the hits of other artists for an album. If you've never heard a Dwight Yoakam record, this is not the one to buy. If you're a die-hard fan like myself you'll probably like the record just because it's a Dwight Yoakam album. But when you look past that you'll realize that it's a pretty sorry excuse for an album."
5,Ooooh that silky voice,This has a huge range of songs and styles but my favourite is 'Don't Go'. I travel on th road a lot and this is one of the definites I take with me to help me get in the driving mood.
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for a ""how-to"" book that would describe techniques & give me a deeper understanding of what men want - ""totally"". This book discribed experiences of various couples. However, the language was coarse & it seemed the writer was trying to ""titillate"" rather than inform. There few specifics & it felt as though I were ""reading"" a dirty movie."
2,Dear Penthouse. . .,More fantasy than helpful. It kind of reminded me of the type of letters you might find in Penthouse or one of those other magazines. Not helpful for a woman who is looking for some concrete ideas.
5,The fixer upper,I would recommend this book for just about anyone. You'd think it was met to be all about him but it really actually helps both partners to communicate and therefore become better lovers overall. I actually own two copies of this book so I have a loaner incase someone needs long term guidance. I'm a therapist of sorts and this book is the key to so many things.
2,Not that impressed,"I was not impressed with alot of the stories and advice in this book at all. To me it is saying if you want to be sexy, you need to change your entire image. And some of the stories are rather disguesting."
4,Darkest Africa,The old movie 'Forbidden Territory' provides an excellent lesson of the history of those early missionary and exploratory adventures in Africa - far from the commonly seen accounts of Gordon's heroic deeds to 'Lawrence of Arabia'.
3,Good for the enthusiast,"I can't imagine the regular viewer getting too much from this tele-movie. Me? Well, I've spent quite a lot of time researching Henry M. Stanley so it was interesting to see 18th Century Africa as depicted by the filmakers."
4,Fun Christmas escape to old England,"This is one of about 15 warm hearted ""Christmas stories"" I have collected & listen to in my car each holiday season...starting 1st of November."
1,For fans of David Irving,"Amazing that this book is hailed as a courageous diatribe on a ""taboo"" subject. As if Anti-Semitism is a taboo subject.It is omnipresent, but not as overt usually as in this man's pseudo-scholarly writings if you can plow through them.Also amazing is that he could hold a position at a University.I learned of him when an Anti-Semite I know sent me an article of his which was part of a series about ""Jewish Influence"" in the Neo Con Movement.He concluded the whole thing was hatched by Jews.They just recruited Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bush, the U.S. Military, Christian Islamaphobic Fundamentalists and other dupes (including Romney and Ryan currently) according to MacDonald, though he disguises this belief somewhat in the form of an academic paper with copious footnotes.If you agree that this is a Zionist Conspiracy this is the book for you."
2,Come On Christmas,This album was a disappointment to me as I really enjoy Dwight Yoakam. Come On Christmas was so depressing. It hardly has a melody. The best was Silver Bells - it has a tex mex feel to it. The rest reminded me of Elvis and the 50's.
5,great kids audio,"This is a great narration of some great classic tales. Lots of action and best of all, it keeps to the original stories. Kids love it. Hansel and Gretel is slightly scary but then it always was."
3,Audio for Kids,"My son hasn't really taking a liking to this rendition of fairy tales. And I must say it has proven to not be as good we'd hoped. In fact he's listened to it only twice since Christmas.The selection of stories could've been better; and those classics I treasured as a child didn't always flow with the time honored readings of past renditions. For example, the Three Little Pigs introduce a man who sells straw, wood, and bricks to the pigs and the ending (the wolf's demise) seemed to drag on a bit.Advice if purchased, take an objective approach - don't get your hopes p too high. Enjoy!!"
1,Rip off free bike,"...This offer includes a ""free"" bike, but the bike isn't really free, it comes at the additional cost of [$$$]. While this may be a good deal, it's hard to know without specific info regarding the bike. In any event, I feel it's a lie to say the bike is ""free"" when it in fact costs extra $$$."
4,Okay but only for collectors,"This is a great figure, but if you want to play with it... no dice. It's sword is surprisingly sharp and it doesn't do much. The detail is excellent though!"
3,Good First Try,If your looking for a cordless finish nailer pass this one up and go to the newer [nailer] by Paslode. The price is about the same to [a little] more... I own two of these and there are times when the cylinder head gets in the way of nailing corners and under toe kicks It's a good nailer but it has been obsoleted by its brother ...
3,mid class gun,its good gun but sometimes its stuck and you cant nail nothing but biside this works ok and you need to clean it every few use
4,Spend some time to save a lot of time,"I've been a cabientmaker for 25 years and have had this nailer for a couple years and use it monthly. As others have said, it's a bit frustrating when it stops firing (and it will). I've been able to get it going again on my own though. The bummer is that it's just not foolproof. You almost need 2 of them if you use it a lot and can't afford down time. All in all though, it's a HUGE time saver and is incredibly convenient over hauling a compressor and a long, cumbersome, constantly tangled hose! I think I just talked myself into two. I don't see the gas as huge expensive as others have said. They're about 6 bucks each and fire 1-2 thousand shots, get over it! Get it, I think you'll be happy. Don't forget to warn ""fire in the hole!"" before shooting the first round as it's a little gun-like sounding and startles the timid."
2,unsatisfied,Bought this product to make my job easier as a trim carpenter but was not what i expected. Maybe I expected too much but I am the only person that uses my tools and trim work is all I do so I know it was not abused.It worked fine for a while then it became high dollar junk. I finally sold it at a garage sale for 100 dollars and was glad to get rid of it. I bought 2 dewalt 18 volt finish nailers and have shot many boxes of nails with no problems. I feel that paslode let me down
4,"Great gun, but wish it was a bit smaller.","This is a great gun! It works flawlessly (so far) and I love not hauling around a compressor with hose. Keep in mind you do have a battery and gas cartridges to maintain, but it is still so convenient. The only downfall is the size of the gun. I wish it was just a bit more compact."
5,And extra place to hang your showerhead.,"I have a handicapped tub with no wallmount for the showerhead. This little item allows me to hang the showerhead anywhere I wish for water that goes down my back rather than having to hold the showerhead in one hand and wash with the other. Great item. Really sticks where you put it, and easily. Removes just as simply."
1,Horrible Product,"This product was horrible. It is cheap plastic that cracks under any kind of pressure. The suction will not work for anything and when you think it does, your whole shower head falls off. Please do not buy this even if they are giving it away."
1,Do not waste your money!!,"This product is not functional. It is plastic, painted with metallic paint. The suction cup would not adhere to cleaned, smooth tile by itself, let alone with the weight of a handheld shower.I had an accident and do not have any way to return it... or I would. Total waste of money. I ordered it to avoid drilling into tile. While it also came with screws, the body is so flimsy, I doubt it could bear any weight."
2,Get the Safe-er grip/Mommy's helper instead,"This shower holder did not stick well to my wall and also does not bend in different directions to get a good angle. The Safe-er grip does. If you just need it to hold the wand, it may be OK, but the other one is better if you or your kids are showering under it."
1,Nice only if you like a horizontal water spray.,This product sucks it holds the sprayer so it goes in a horizontal line and it spins around under the weight of the sprayer.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR THE SUCTION FEATURE,"I purchased this suction showerhead wall mount. I wish I had read the reviews before I did. The plumber who installed my showerhead tried twice to attach it to the smooth clean tile. I have tried 5 times following the instructions in the package. It has never stayed up for more than 5 minutes and that is without the weight of the showerhead. I do not want to drill a hole in my bathroom tile, so this product is useless to me."
2,Shower Head Mount,"Seems to be a nice well made mount except for the suction cup. It held on the shower wall just fine, just with the weight of a hand held shower, the mount was trying to pull away from the suction cup and looked horrible."
2,Came as described but not very strong,"I ordered this product to replace the original suction cup mount that came with my dual showerhead. The product was shipped and arrived promptly. However, the suction cup and mount are very small and would not hold the showerhead. This item is only for light weight and/or small showerheads."
1,horrible wall suction,"This thing is horrible. Even though it did not cost much, it was a total waste of money. It is a piece of garbage and does not stick. Brand new piece of trash."
1,Poor Performance,"I recently purchased the shower head mount for my wife to have a lower reach shower head. This product is cheaply made and does not support a light weight hand held shower head. Even when it would hold just the water pressure would knock it off the wall. Bottom line ""A waste of MONEY""."
3,huh?,I haven't even used this thing yet because I do not have a drill to install it and haven't bought one yet
2,Suction or permanent showerhead mount,"Well, this product looks ok but, after receiving it I realize that it has no adjustment, so I would recommend one that has more adjustments so if your kid wants to shower without it spraying in there face I would get one that you can adjust up and down."
1,It does fit the shower head,"This device was recommended with the purchase of the Pic shower head that I purchased, at the same time. Doesn't anyone bother to see if these two things even fit together. My wife must shower sitting down and mount would have put the shower head within easy reach."
2,Better than a Hook,I wish that all shower heads for recreational vehicles would come with a custom-fitted hanger. This one works but doesn't fit the shower arm - at all.
1,Fragile and does not stick. Otherwise OK.,"This is made of brittle, low quality plastic and breaks easily. It also does not stick to a new fiberglass tub shower unit. I glued it to make it stick, but it ended up breaking."
1,Get Mommy's Helper Safer shower grip instead!!!!!,"I bought this to replace an old Mommy's Helper Safer Shower Grip that had broken after a few years of use. I liked the faux chrome look better in my shower. BIG MISTAKE!!! It has not suctioned to the surface once! Not to the shower wall and not to the glass shower door! Mommy's Helper is not perfect, but u can attach and reattach it over and over again while in the shower! I'm throwing this one away and ordering another Mommy's Helper instead!"
2,The title of this item should be LDR 520 2433C 2-In-1 Permanent cuz it won't suction...,"I bought this showerhead wall mount thinking it would be perfect since I was a bit tired of resting the showerhead on the stall floor. I wanted to use the suction option since the walls of my shower are super flat (without texture). I live in an apartment where screwing holes in the shower wall might be frowned upon as well. Unfortunately, after following the directions that come with the item carefully, the stinking mount would not stay on the wall. I tried cleaning the wall again, suctioning wet, suctioning not wet...you get the idea. I can understand if the wall mount wouldnt hold my bulking shower head on the wall but it can't even hold itself up! If you don't plan on screwing it into the wall, don't bother with this item."
1,Shower Head Holder,"This product probably would be fine for some shower heads, but mine was too big to fit in it.It was too inexpensive to bother to return."
1,Bad product,This product does not work well. It's cheaply made and does not hold the shower handle well. Rotates with the shower handle since the actual holder is screwed onto the suction cup underneath. I got drenched giving my son a shower because the holder was not able to heep the shower handle in place.
4,Nice mount and very economical,Arrive quickly and as advertised nice mount for the price. Highly recommend for people who wants to have the second shower handle lowered for conveniance very helpful for children and elderly users.
2,Bad angle,"I bought this so my 6 year old could take a shower. I wanted a nice looking hand held shower hanger to match my fixtures. The suction works pretty well, but like other suction bath accessories I've tried, it falls off after a while. Unfortunately the angle is wrong, it squirts straight out, at least with my Waterpik shower. We used it for a few weeks but being showered in the face isn't pleasant for my daughter, so we opted not to re-install it after it fell off. I am going to try the Mommy's helper even though it's not pretty."
1,disappointed,"I have been looking everywhere to find a holder for my handheld shower head. What I have right now holds the shower head for a while and then the shower head would fall out. This one I just bought from Amazon.com was even worse. The hole is so small that my shower head (a regular standard one) couldn't even fit into it. But since it only costs a few bucks, I'm not going to return it."
1,Rubbish,The attachment was rubbish. I fixed it to the shower wall using the suction method and put the shower head in it and watched it slide down the wall. Waste of money.
3,"Good idea, doesn't work all the time","I purchased this item so that I could give my toddlers a shower and have somewhere to keep the shower head when I needed to set it down. Most of the time it works, but there have been times where the whole thing loses suction and the shower head falls down. Also, there have been times where the shower head has slipped out of the top because it doesn't stay securely in there. I'd say about 85% of the time it works fine and I'm really glad I have it...the other 15% I'm using quick reflexes to catch a shower head and avoid getting sprayed with water! Couldn't find anything better out there that worked for me so I'd rather have this than nothing."
2,Didn't stick.,Don't get this unless you have very smooth tile. My tile has a slight texture and the suction cup lets go after only a second or two. So useless for me as I'm not drilling into my rental's tile.
1,Are You Kidding?,"Am I missing something? 24 shows on 6 DVDs? And these episodes ran for a half hour on TV, so that means they're really about 22 - 24 minutes without commercials. So, that's 4 episodes per disk...and all this for almost fifty bucks. No way! They could have fit all of the episodes on two disks for about $20, and left room for special features.Hold off for a special edition, or something like that. Dragnet (the 1950's version) was much too good of a show to get this type of treatment!UPDATE - Feb 2011:Since I wrote this review in 2008, they have knocked off about twenty bucks from the price and are offering it today (2/8/11) for $29.99. That's still a little steep, but better than the $50 price tag back in 2008."
2,Totally Negative,"This CD bites only for one reason. It only has songs on it!! I buy his CDs for the acts, not the songs. And to be perfectly frank, the only good song on it is ""The Goat Song"""
5,"Great, funny, new, differnent, GREAT","This is so funny, I laughed all day. Even after I listened to it. Adam Sandler surely is gifted. This is the best CD I have heard in a long time, I just can't wait till Stan & Judy's kid his next CD."
1,Waste of money,"This cd sucked, it needs skits in it. Adam Sandler isn't a singer, he just can make up some funny ass shit. I would have rated it with 0 stars, but it is not a selection."
4,A CD W/ some great A. Sandler Originality!!!,"Even though this Cd doesn't have the skites like there all gonna to laugh at you and what the hell happened to me, it has a lot of funny songs. My personal favorite is the Goat song whiched is based on a skite from the second album. The only thing I don't like about this album is that some of the songs are kinda slow and dull. I have got to give this album 4 stars because it has very creative songs and a lot of laughs!!!!"
4,"""What's Your Name?"" is a great CD","Adam Sandler is a great comedian but I really wish he used that talent more on his new CD. For instance on both of his last to CD's he used funny scenes but on ""What's Your Name?"" he only had songs."
1,I'm sorry. I just don't get it.,"adam sandler is a very funny commedian. His movies are hilarious and his album, ""they're Gonna Laugh at You is one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life. ""What's Your Name"", however, is just not funny. I think sandler has always wanted to be a musician and he tries to be one on this album moreso than a commedian. ""the Lonesome Kicker"" is kind of funny and 'The Goat song"" is absolutely hilarious, but the rest of the album is just plain boring. It's not funny and the songs aren't good enough musically to listen to despite the lack of humor. When Sandler does skits no one can touch him in the funny department and when he mixes one or two songs in with the skits they work very well, but I'm sorry, he's just not good enough a musician to make a cd with nothing, but songs on it, especially when the words aren't funny."
4,It's good and it'll make you laugh.,This is a pretty good CD most of the songs are funny and will give a good laugh. This is a CD that has songs will make you laugh 'till your cheeks hurt.
3,If your a true fan of Adam Sandler you'll like this Cd.,"Adam's new CD is not as funny as his previous Cd's, but this Cd does have its moments. I would have to say overall it's not to bad."
1,so/so,This soap has hardly any lather and the scent smells like public school bathroom soap. Really disappointing buy.
5,Great Book,"I love this book. There are mulitple plans, and they are easy to follow. There is information on how to care for the plants after you plant them. You won't be disappointed with this book."
5,Unique and perfectly written book!,"I am a beginner quilter.. and by beginner I mean I'm making my very first. Needless to day, I decided I really wanted to include a celtic design on the quilt. This book shows patterns and many very useful techniques for exactly that! I had first checked it out at my local library and then decided to purchase it. The author is WONDERFUL and walks you through everything and adds many tips that are so important. I really love how she also provides more than one way to accomplish what you are trying to do, but she does tell you her favorite way. If you want to give machine applique a try, or I suspect if you want to attempt celtic designs.... I highly recommend this!!!"
5,Beautiful designs,I admit that I haven't made a Celtic quilt (yet) but it's on my list of quilts to do after reading this book. The author gives you all of the help you'd need create a beautiful Celtic quilt using bias bars and making your own bias tubes. I'm thinking of purchasing a Celtic font (available online) to make my own patterns. I've seen Celtic quilts in quilt shows and they always seem to steal the show.
5,Great Product,"I use this product for a sugar glider cage, as well as for a rabbit cage. I have tried many cage cleaning products, but haven't found a product that works as well as this does."
2,Did Ruth Rendell really write this?,"Never before has a Rendell novel left me so cold. Totally untypical of its brilliant author, ""Some Lie and Some Die"" is dull and unsatisfying, and offers little to reward the reader for enduring such tedium. The characters--with a few exceptions--are uninteresting; detection is slow and scarce, and the motive for the murder turns out to be highly improbable. It's as if Rendell wrote a mystery starting with the body but forgot to include a plausible reason for it. Where is the seamless manipulation, the ingenuity, the stunning surprise twists interlaced with brilliant psychological insight, that are the hallmarks of Rendell's work? Not here. The few bright spots are the scenes between Inspector Burden and his son, which show us a humor, an energy missing from the rest of this dead, bleak novel. Let's just toss this one along with ""Simisola"" into Rendell's ""Forget about it"" pile."
1,'Orrid,Completely ridiculous plot with unbelievable relationships between the characters. Even the sidekick's relationship to his kids was silly and the attempts at writing lyrics and hip argot were quite bad. I thought Rendell was one of the better authors but this must have been written on a bad day. Did British senior inspectors in small towns really have chauffeurs back in the 70's?
4,great book if you don't know where to start .....,This a great book if you are looking for lesson ideas on introducing art terminology and practice into your classroom. This book offers 9 lessons per grade from k-5th. The only thing that I found lacking was a print of each masterpiece--I was unfamiliar with some of them and it would have been good to see.
2,not great,"2 weeks after i purchased item the on/off button broke, the vibrator itself is stationed more in the middle then where the feet are positioned"
5,Pro-Stat,"This was exactly what I needed, and it arrived in a timrly manner. It is helping to heal my husband's wounds. Thanks!"
5,works well,being using this saw to cut glass to make fused glass artwork. it works very well. used the original blade to cut ceramic kiln shelves. did buy a better blade for cutting glass. the pump sprays lots of water. the sliding table works well when pushed in the right places. would buy again.
4,Good lens for the price,"I Use this lens to take picture of music players performances with low light, its a good option for that"
4,Julienne Potatoes,"I am not a huge fan of convenience foods so prefer to cook from scratch when possible. But sometimes when you're on the go, it is helpful to have a few items that you can throw together at a moment's notice. Of all the pre-packaged potato mixes, I think this one is the best. My kids love these Julienne Potatoes."
4,OKAY,"Cheesy potatoes. I didn't taste anything but the same orange cheese everyone knows from boxed dinners. It says it has other cheeses, but I couldn't tell. They are okay. My family liked them more then I did."
4,"The keyword here is ""simple"". Establishing a budget everyone in the family can live with couldn't be simpler.","I found this book to be clear and concise. The author explains many basics of finance that I thought only the experts knew. The author lays out the simplest way to do a budget I have ever seen. He calls it the Money Allocation Plan or ""MAP"". The MAP is basically your monthly budget. Each month you start a new MAP. It trully is a must for every family."
2,Lenox Balloon Wine,"Well, I should have listened to previous reviews, glasses arrived shattered. I would imagine that they WERE very nice. My full refund with return shipping was given. When will Amazon learn, that in order to ship fragile wine glasses they MUST be properly packaged. Thank you Amazon for easy return.I am giving 2 stars due to easy return."
2,Received a box of broken glass,"This was a disappointment. My mother ordered these glasses as a gift for me on December 4th. I did not receive them until January 5th (well after Christmas) and what I received was a joke. All the glasses were obliterated. I would hope that my experience was an anomaly, but the glasses were packaged so poorly I cannot believe that others aren't receiving anything but shards also. From the remains, they look like they could be nice glasses. I hope Amazon is more forthright about replacing them than they have been with my mother about the shipping delays. She was told twice that I would receive the 'glasses' before Christmas and was told that I received them 3 days before I actually did. Poor experience all together.Update: I did receive the second shipment and all glasses were intact. The glasses are very nice, however I would not buy them through Amazon."
4,"My son asks for these by the word ""pop""",These are awesome and very good for my special needs child. He can put them together and pull them apart - great motor skill toy. The reason for the 4 star rating is that you should be aware that one set doesn't go a long way. We have three sets and that is enough to make a couple of necklaces.
4,Medieval History,"This Atlas is good for the study of the medieval world. But I consider this atlas need more maps. For example, the battle for Scotland to obtain the independence; also, the mongol empire in times of Genghis Khan and Kubblai Khan."
3,It is what it is,"It is what it the title says, of course, and it was everything I expected it to be. The maps and short paragraphs of historical information surrounding the maps are very interesting and detailed. If you have a great deal of interest in the Middle Ages, this book is very helpful for attaining a visual picture of the world you read about"
4,Wonderful contemporary music,"We heard Blackberry Winter on the local classical station and my music-loving 10yo immediately said, ""We have to find out what this is and get it."" We don't often love contemporary compositions for orchestra, so when we all agreed that we loved the music, I knew we would have to track it down. The instrumentation is great too -- the guitar in particular meshes very well with the orchestra. The comparison to Aaron Copeland is very apt."
5,Get the best fast,"I heard this recording on NPR radio and loved it. While it was out of the mainstream usually stocked at music stores, I found it on Amazon, ordered it, and received in a matter of days! The recording is a lovely collection of Tennessee / Celtic pieces with wonderful solo work. Ellisor is a Nashville musician and composer and her ""Blackberry Winter"" for Tennessee music box is a real delight. Other pieces on the CD are by Barber, Kodaly, Mock, and Scearce."
5,Blackberry Winter,"I heard Blackberry Winter half asleep on Classical 24 and knew I wanted to hear it again. I just got the CD and have only listened to B.W. so far, but if the rest of the disc is a hog calling contest held by ducks, I would still give it 5 stars."
1,Don't waste your money,"My 8 yr old son received this toy for his birthday. Thrilled to get it, it literally fell apart while he was playing with it. The BUU GOO stains, the plastic pieces break, and the head itself does not close properly."
3,It's kinda good.,"I thought the boo goo was kinda cool. I knew it came with 41 inch people. (I have over 100 other mini figures.) I not sure what people mean by literally falling apart, It's never fallen apart on me. The buu pods were also kinda cool."
1,This thing stinks!!!!!,I got this thing thinking it would come with 4 six inch tall action figures with poseable joints like it showed on the cover!I was wrong this thing came with 4 1 centimeter tall action figures and the playset fell apart in minutes after i unrapped it.
1,30 minutes of fun,"My 8-year-old was thrilled to get this. But the pieces kept falling off, which really frustrated him. After 30 minutes, he never touched it again."
4,Good Price,"This was a registered gift for a wedding. Not my style, but much less expensive than anywhere else. So overall a good deal."
2,Not as pictured,I am disappointed in this book. It is nothing like the photo shown. I am keeping because of the verbiage in the book. It looks like a library book.
5,Wonderful,"I hadn't heard BJ Thomas in years, but was a huge fan when I was younger. He still sounds as great as ever. Hearing his voice brought back a million memories. The songs are wonderful. It is the best Christmas CD I have bought in a long time."
1,Vaughn Hatch,"Another reviewer calls this tiller counter productive. They are absolutely correct. The counter rotating tines prevent the tiller from going forward and cause it to veer off course. Compared to the quality of old Troy-bilts this is a shoddy machine. The tines break like they were made of glass. The customer service is terrible. I ordered two right hand tines and was sent two left hand tines. I had to pay $10 shipping to get the wrong parts, pay $10 more to return them, and pay another $10 to get the correct ones. I was told by the customer service rep that that was MTD's policy. The only quality on this machine is the Honda engine. You will be more productive with a $10 hoe."
3,bordeaux shipments,"1 of the 3 boxes of glasses i ordered was completely shattered. i spoke to the company several weeks ago, but still have not rec'd the replacement shipment. very annoying. other than that, the glasses in the 2 boxes that were not damaged are great."
4,Better than nothing,"This is an invaluable resource for the history of natural history in the 19th century, it also clearly demonstrates the inaccuracy of the author's next study of his father ""Father & Son"". However, the reproduction is terribly faulty - quote marks consistently out of place, words not separated by spaces, sentences made to resemble poetry, etc., etc. This said, it is better used as a text for study than for reading enjoyment (for which I needed it), even though it is more accurate than Father & Son, mostly because the author quotes copiously from the many diaries & notes of his father."
3,"Cute, but uncomfortable","These are really cute shoes, but they are not comfortable at all. I have tried just about every insert imaginable to make them bearable, but nothing helps. OK for a day at the office just sitting at your desk, but not for a night out."
2,Painfully Delicious,They're cute...they hurt my feet...I lost my sales slip/receipt. They're now collecting dust in my closet until I can find a new owner for them.
1,Avoid,"Crashes every time after opening credits (Mac OSX 10.6.5). Am looking for solutions but fail to see why i should have to waste my time. Cannot believe how many companies release products that won't function. Shame, it looks promising but doesn't work."
1,2nd Editions was bad....I have no hope for this one.,2nd Edition sucked. B. Welsh is all over the place. examples were very bad. I would not touch anything this guy does.
5,TCL/TK,This is a great book not only beginers but for pro's as well. It has great information and helpful examples that contribute to the learning of TCL/TK. Has lot's of stuff on the CD so you can find a whole bunch of utilities for TCL/TK as well.
1,Very Disappointing,"Definitely not for beginners, this book skips over topics offering few or no useful examples. What examples there are, are incomplete and offer little help when you are trying to do things yourself. I have a 20 page handout from a TCL introductory seminar which I have found infinitely more useful than this book.The only use for this book is for someone who already has mastered tcl/tk and needs a quick syntax check. It is only really useful to find something you already know."
1,Not Recommended,"I was very disapointed with this book. There are any number of basic programming elements that any language needs to provide -- and tcl does, but this book doesn't even address. (Or at least, they're not listed in a way one can find them.)An example: compound conditional expressions such as:if {$sky == ""blue"" || $sun == ""shining""}are not covered.Instead, chapter 3 goes into html. If you're looking for a book on tcl don't get this one."
3,not too impressed,"I am not too impressed with this book. A beginner needs to have useage examples, since a quote, bracket, etc here or there can make a big difference. Welch's book does not give good useage examples on more than one topic. For example, in describing the clock statement, There is an extensive table on formatting options, but not one example on how to use the keywords. Another example is the use of the test command to check two strings in a loop control statement. On several occasions, I have wasted time just hacking around, changing placements of things, putting in extra brackets, etc. in order to find the exact sequence that works."
2,Hard to understand examples and ambiguous wording,"I had picked this book up to learn TCL to take over a fairly simple TCL code base at work. As a person that is familiar with scripting and programming languages, I found this book hard to understand.Specifically, example (8-4) is suppose to show an example for passing arrays by name. However, the example is quite cryptic as it uses a variable named array on the same line that it also uses the array TCL command. This causes the example to be fairly obfuscated and hard to understand.In the first chapter they list the built-in math functions but give very little background on them. They fail to mention that the ceil function actually returns a floating point number. In the index for ceil they even state ""next highest integer,"" which is incorrect.I have not been impressed by this book for learning and understanding TCL and would not recommend it to colleagues. I can't comment on the TK section of the book, I'm hoping the book is better for learning TK."
1,Hard book for learning TCL,"I bought this book at the bookstore since I had to learn TCL for work. This was one of the few book I was able to find at the time. This is not organized in the presentation. Instead of showing some syntax followed by a few examples, it shows this CGI example. I learned some of the language from looking at code.In the next chapter, the book picks up where it left off. By that time, you have forgotten what was discussed. I would not recommend this book.Now that I have been laid off, many companies are making the request for TCL knowledge and I am looking for a suitable book."
1,Tcl trick collection!,"(This review is for the 3rd edition of this book, andI am only half way through the book.)It is very hard to learn Tcl/Tk reading this book.This book does not teach you THE language. It onlytries to teach you tricks and way arounds that couldbe useful for someone already know Tck/Tk.If the author have devoted a couple of early chaptersto explain the principles of the language, he wouldn'thave to write such a thick book full of only tricks.Worse, the examples in the book are often not wellexplained, and you have to jump around the chaptersto read the examples because most examples use commandsthat are introduced in later chapters."
