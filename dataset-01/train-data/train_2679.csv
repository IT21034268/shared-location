2,Application to Golf Too Sketchy,"This is a very good fitness book. Now that I've read a couple of others on Golf Fitness, I think this one has good strengthening & stretching exercises for golfers. My chief criticism is that its applicability to different aspects of the game of golf is too sketchy for golfers who don't understand how fitness will benefit their game and their overall health and well-being. The best golf fitness book I've read is Cindy Reid's book, GET YOURSELF IN GOLF SHAPE, which I HIGHLY recommend over this one."
3,Truly Manufactured!,"Like some other post read, Mancow has sold out for the best get-back. It's true, his hypocritical views started to sicken me until I realized this is entertainment not an encylopedia.Man cow lies and changes his story, but he does this to appeal to the masses. He swears he is keeping it real. bah humbug! He does what ever it takes to stay at the top of the charts, like promoting his book non stop on his show, or the episode where he had his phone poll ""What do you hate about mancow?""! Like that wasn't free marketing research! Bah Humbug!It's entertainment, you'd be a dummy to think otherwise. As a listener to the show sometimes I catch mancow in a lie but in any case he's usually entertaining. His book is entertaining but it's probably exagerated stretches of the truth."
1,..I don't understand,I brought this book over 4 months ago for $1.75. I am still trying desperately to read or finish this book..but..I can't. Sure I'm from Chicago and I listen to Mancow. I can understand his radio show...more then I can read his book.. and that puzzles me a lot..Maybe if mancow signes my book..maybe..just maybe. I could finish it...
4,Em.. an interesting book,I like it because it really a good references for us on communication to our younger generation.
1,EW said it best,"I couldn't say it better than Entertainment Weekly so I submit the words written by Josh Wolk.""Shock jocks like Chicago-based Mancow rely on charisma, momentum, and volume, not logic, which is why the book form fails the raunchy radio rebel: Reread any portion of this paean to his late father and himself (oh, the hot chicks he's slept with!) and you'll find it's held together with nothing but bluster and buzzwords. This European travelogue/quasi-biography (the lurching, free-form structure makes his career trajectory incomprehensible) is filled with self-important rants unintentionally rife with paradox, as when he visits the Dachau concentration camp, bemoans the Nazis' inhumanity, but then says 'someone should kill the artist' responsible for the 'horrendous' memorial sculpture there. He must make more sense when you're only half listening."""
2,Mancow Milks Himself of some Particulary Puerile...,"""squeezin's."" One can certainly tell that Mancow has read his Hunter S. Thompson. His style is hyper, self-congratulatory (even while bemoaning certain of his own behaviors Mancow himself finds cruel), nightmarish, occasionally funny, intentionally boastful. Mancow's antics read like those of a perennial adolescent. Indeed, and most telling, like fellow shlock meister ""Coward Sperm"" Mancow rails against elitists while cutting anyone off at the knees who won't join Mancow's group of fawning, self-described freaks.Mancow's slim confessional is mental masturbation at its most banal."
5,A Must Read for Anyone with a Dad,"My dad is still with me, but the Pain Mancow shares in his book is intence. His book has brought me closer to my father, knowing I have only a certaion amount of time till I join Mancow in the Dead dad's Club. Several of his stories will make you laugh your A$$ off, while some of his childhood memories cause you to stop and think about some of the actions you have done in the past as well. A must Read for anyone with a dad!"
1,Disapointed,"Was quite disapointed in this game, I can't get it to run. I had contacted the game company support they were very good about getting back to me quite promptly, but it seems there is an issue with this game running on a dual core system. I have the previous game ""Napoleonic Wars"" and that is fun, and was looking forward to this one."
3,The Original Was Better,"I bought Cossacks a long time ago and loved it! This was like the first version so I had trouble finding people to play with online since my version was so old.Once I got a pair of monitors and a new video card to run them on, the old software wouldn't work with the new hardware. :( So I wanted to upgrade to the newer version so I could play again.I haven't found a true random may option where I can select a general terrain and number of computer players to play against and build from scratch. All of the options start with some basic setup and a general object to the round. It is hard to get your community ready for an attack if you don't know how to play the game already.As a result, my kids don't like this game nearly as much as the original version."
4,Great Game Good AI,"Fun, Great Graphics, lots of play time, AI is good but not great. Overall 4 of 5 stars, AI is 3 of 5. Some minor problems with Cassons loading cannons but not to distracting."
2,Cossacks II: Buy Imperial Glory instead!,"Having played Imperial Glory, a game about the same historical period, I thought this game fell short. On the up side, the building graphics are beautiful and it is an easy game to start playing and know what you are doing. On the downside, the unit graphics are only fair because of the orientation of the camera. The game play also gets repetitive after a while. I quit playing after about a week. The game also lacks the features of previous Cossacks titles. With no editor, no naval units and a lack of skirmish maps, this game seems to have been rather rushed. If you love the Napoleonic genre, then you may want to give it a go and maybe it's flaws can be overlooked but if you want a classic RTS, with staying power and a long life, like Age of Empires or Rise of Nations, this ain't it."
5,Coossacks 2 BFE Rocks,Its graphics are amazing. All battles are based on real facts. I haven't had any glitches with the system. The Internet server is good to!!!!!!!!!!
3,good game,The game is good but not awsome. only 3 stars from me. it is fun to play but very difficult at some points in the game. multiplayer is very challenging.
1,Good for a laugh,"First off unless you speak the laguedege, or put in the English subtitles, you won't follow it.I thought the expressions on these guys faces were halarious. The women are pretty, but some are too young to look at, and they're practising making it feel really good to the guys, which explains their expressions. The funny part of their expressions are that they have the same expressions as those guys in the old kung foo movies when they got hit really hard.In short, I wouldn't recomind this movie, but who am I?"
3,Made by the creator of Love Hina...,"this earlier work kind of falls short. The idea is simple: a student, name of Hitoshi Kobe, likes making artifical intelligences (which is the only thing he is good at). Well, one day one of his programs, in fact the best program of the whole lot, becomes real. So, if you love robots or androids, this is not the manga for you. Think more 'Oh My Goddess', but without the good stories.I can't really compare this work to the 'Love Hina' manga, as I collect the anime, but when compared to other manga, it doesn't cut it. It does have extras and interesting Q&A areas, where the creator, Ken Akamatsu, answers questions about art and girls. Yet, that just isn't enough - maybe it just didn't age well or looks bad when compared to newer manga (not that it is really old). Think watered-down.If you are a fan of the creator or can find it cheap, try it. But don't waste your money on it if you don't have to."
3,A little bit too much of the same old same old,"If you've read more than one series of Manga or watched more than one anime series you've already seen this plot. Gorgeous girl pulled out of computer, lovingly stays at the side of nerdy, horny naughty-thought generating teenage boy. Its sweet and I don't think the drawings bad, but I've already seen too much of it. I bought the first volume, I'll end it with that."
1,Don't get this,This book says it's for 16 year olds well I'll say it's for 21 year olds I've read the first 2 started the 3rd one and it's starting to be like Porno I got rid of mine by selling them on ebay but I would get this series
1,Not for children,"I was dissapointed this came up under drawing books for children; the content is inappropriate for kids. For example, chase scenes with guns and shooting. Book does not show many steps how to draw the cars. For adults who have drawing skills."
1,dissappointing for anyone who wants to learn,"I am a professional illustrator and was looking for a cool drawing book for my son. I came across this book at the library and thought ""I would love to see if this has some good tips or even neat tricks with drawing cars."" After the first page, I quickly learned that no, it's not a book that teaches anyone how to draw cars, but rather tells you about the cars you'd like to draw.So if your kids like cars, cool they'll like this. If your kids or anyone else wants to actually DRAW cars, stay away from this book. There are much better resources out there."
4,a niche mic,"A great mic though limited-purpose given its coloring of sound. Is excellent for mic'ing an overdriven guitar amp if you're looking for a crunchy, thick late 60's sound. Great for mic-ing percussion if, again you're looking for a crunchy, thick and punchy sound. If you're looking for clarity, definition or crisp balanced response through the whole frequency spectrum, this is not the right mic-try a good condenser mic."
2,Disappointing,"The editorial review of this series from School Library Journal is wrong. The new editions of these books do not ""expand greatly"" on the original 1988 editions; they greatly contract. The 1988 edition of the books on Ancient Egypt and Ancient Mesopotamia had eight chapters and 92 pages. This new edition gives them only only six chapters and 64 pages, and the word count per page is reduced. Indeed color pictures and illustrations were added and the glossary expanded, but the text is reduced to about two thirds of the original. Students are better off reading the original editions in the Watts ""First Book"" series."
4,Wonderful Illustrated English-Dutch Kids' Dictionary,"I really love this book. My family is in Belgium in the Flemish region because of my husband's military service. This book has been fascinating to us. I read it with my daughter very often. She's learning so many Dutch words! My Flemish neighbors and their young daughters also love the book because it helps them learn English, too. I HIGHLY recommend this book, especially since there are so few English-Dutch books out there."
2,Not what I expected,"This is definitely not what I expected. There is no in depth review of each country. I wish I had seen this book before I bought it, because I would've steered clear. Out of 48 pgs, only 14 pgs are dedicated to a 2-page display of each continent. You find out nothing about the actual countries and capitals besides little pictures on the ""maps."" Most of the book is filler pages on basic background info such as getting around (by gondola in Venice, rickshaw in China, snowmobiles in snowy places, etc.)"
2,Seems to have an agenda,"Eh. Not my favorite book. Seems to have a really liberal agenda on how the earth was made, etc...not even middle ground stuff. I'm not a screaming conservative, but it bothered me."
2,Buy the entire harmonica,I purchased this reed replacement set for my Lee Oscar D and immediately discovered that the reeds are not checked before shipping. I guess it's time to go back to playing the Hohner Special 20's. Even after cleaning and checking the edges these reeds are thin sounding and not as bright as what you would find on a brand new Lee Oscar Harmonica.
3,Great customer service from Salamander,"Previously I rated this a 1-star for the poor machining of the threaded rods. But after contacting Salamander, they sent another set of the rods to me immediately. And with the new set, I did not run into the same issue. As others have stated, it took some time to assemble the rack. But overall, I am happy with the result. I am giving it a 3.5 star.-- Original Review --Due to poor machining of the threaded rods, I am not able to insert the nuts into 3 out of the 4 rods. I called Salamander Designs this morning, left a message, and waiting for call back. Will see how Salamander will resolve this problem."
2,bad shipment,Its amazing that you buy a product through Amazon and the product comes short of rods.Worst you cannot reach a person to talk and get help from amazon.You will have to contact the manufacturer to get help.
3,"Parents loved it, but not the best value.","I assume most people would buy this as a gift, which is what I did. In that respect - it's great. My parents (born in 1948) both loved it, and it was certainly a fun walk down memory lane for them.That said - for $29 and another 10 for shipping, you're looking at 40 dollars for what amounts to maybe five dollars in candy at most. The box looks full when it arrives, but it's about 3/4 full of black ribbon paper so that the candy inside doesn't jostle around. Looking at the box in the picture, it's not even 1/3 of the way full when you take the paper out of it and see just how much candy you're actually getting.Three stars for the idea of it - it definitely makes a great gift, but honestly you could assemble something like this on your own for about 1/4 the price. If the presentation is worth the money to you (and it is well done) then you should pick one of these up."
2,Not Fresh,"The candy was not very fresh. I thought it was going to be made fresh....not in the 50's. I was expecting more, I guess."
2,para dormir,"Un elenco exhorbitante carente de parlamentos con sentido comun. La historia es buena pero vagamente trabajada. Para un dia de lluvia y a falta de cualquier otra pelicula o evento de ver, pues resuelve."
5,A New Reality...Different Classes Coming Together In Marriage,"I thought this was an excellent movie and I cannot wait to purchase it on DVD. It's a new reality! You have different classes of individuals crossing that great divide...STATUS. While some harp on the ""ghetto"" undertone in some movies with African Americans, this is a present reality. It also shows the reality that often times, people are put into your life to make you BETTER. Essentially, isn't that what we want? Someone that we love and that will also compliment us and not take away? This is a must see people because times... they certainly are a'changin'."
4,Much better than I thought,"I was pleasantly surprised! When this movie was in the theater, I had no desire to see it. Finally, after several of my friends and coworkers kept telling me how enjoyable it was, I watched it on my tablet while on the train to work one day. I have to admit that I laughed out loud and my eyes started tearing up at one point in the film. It won't win any oscars, but I loved the fact that the movie had a great message and pulled it off without any cursing or sex. That's quite an accomplishment these days! And I always love Loretta Divine - she is a riot. Fortunately though, the director did not let her steal the movie. The other characters and actors do a great job too. And it was great to see Angela Bassett starring in a role that seemed to be tailor-made for her personality. Jumping the Broom is definitely worth a watch."
3,Fall Asleep,"I really only give it 2 1/2 stars. I watched the whole movie...why?Worst movie I seen this year, yes I just watched it.Bad acting. It did have a few good points, few and far between."
2,Love the Cast But......,"I purchased the download and it worked perfectly. Now to review the movie. I love the cast members of this movie but the movie itself was not well developed. The lack of connection between the two leading characters killed it for me. I did not feel any romance between these two and it was like watching a bad play between first-time actors instead of seasoned actors. I have to say I love Laz but he didn't have any chemistry with Paula Patton whose character acted more like a teen/young adult instead of a woman with a college degree.And, using Tasha Smith in a secondary role was not a good choice either. Her talent deserved more than holding Loretta Devine's hand. She should have been paired with Gary Dourdan (much better chemistry than paring him with Megan Goode who is half his age.) and paired Megan with Romeo."
5,Jumping The Broom,"Jumping the BroomI was drawn into the movie almost instantly from the beginning. This was a movie that showed just how it could really be when mixing families from very different backgrounds and living spaces. Simply loved this movie! I would recommend this as a ""must see"" to anyone. Will be on the look out for more amazing movies!"
3,Mixed review.,"I liked the most of the movie, but the some of the music interludes were intrusive. Hated how vindictive the groom's mother was. Communication is the key to relationships."
4,great service,"I can't believe the dvd came in so fast, It came in after only 2 days and you can't ask for better service. The condition of the dvd looked new, still in wrapper so I'm very please. If the vide show as good as the service I will be overly happy."
1,bad bad dont buy,this DVD came with a very bad packaging and the color of the front photo was not clear it was washed away and the ...... what is not to say about this but the movie is nice
1,Not Good at all,"Watched the movie, was confused by the editing and bad acting. The plot was horrible. The twist at the end was very ridiculous. The movie was not funny at all, seriously this movie was not not funny. I told a friend to watch the movie at their own risk and they only made it 20 minutes in. Check out netflix reviews because this audience doens't seem to know a good movie. Lil Romeo is in teh movie and has speaking parts. You know something is wrong with that."
2,Trailer was good but actual movie was not,"This movie wasn't as good as the trailer made it out to be. I was disappointed with it. I watched the whole movie anyway, and only once. I have since donated this movie to a Thrift Store."
4,Jumping the Broom,"The movie quality could of been better. Some parts were dry, but the message was excellent. Two people meet and fall in love, but their families are from two different backgrounds and they all have issues. True Love will always conquer and overcome."
4,jumping the broom,I didn't think this movie was going to be very good at first but after reading the write-ups on Amazon i decided to go ahead and order it and im glad i did. it was a very funny feel good kind of movie. it made me laugh and almost cry. i think if you like comedy you should definately take a look at jumping the broom.
2,You can't turn a strumpet into a housewife,"The story lines flowed very well for a fantasy trip, but the idea of this woman deciding to stop having one night stands, and making a promise to god to save it (her cookies) for her future husband is a morality disposition that both had differnt agendas for. For him, he just wanted the sex that had eluded him for six months, even though she revealed her sex history to him. For her, she just wanted to show her parents that she could become a good housewife, regardless of her previous sexcapades. I, as many, have seen similar situations in real life and witnessed those marriages lasting only a few months after the wedding. Loretta Devine caught onto Sabrina's facade very quickly."
5,Jumping the Broom,"Wonderful movie! TD Jakes did it again! It's funny, frustrating, sad, emotional all in one without being vulgar or raunchy which is so unnecessary."
5,Had to grow on me....but love it now :),"It took some time to really appreciate this movie. I guess, I was burnt out from movie watching but I have to say now this is my go-to movie, comfort movie, fall asleep to movie. When I need a good feeling or good laugh, I really enjoy this one. Best part of the film is during the rehearsal dinner and Aunt Geneva sings, ""Let's Get Down Tonight"". So funny, she's a good actress anyway. I really liked her on ""Half and Half""....Anyway, I like this one!"
4,Fun movie!,"Very entertaining! Mike Epps & the 'aunt/mother' were hilarious! Meagan Good is always cute. An overall fun movie to watch. Of course, Angela Bassett is a classic, elegant actor; always an asset to any movie. And Ms. Loretta Devine is as divine as ever. Great supporting cast."
1,Title and Decription are a LIE!,It says it weighs 8 ounces and that it is 48 25ML tubes. I got (1) 25 ml tube that is no where close to 1 ounce. I could have gotten that same product cheaper somewhere else.
5,The best book for Learning the Chinese Language.,Practical Chinese Reader is the most well set-up book for learing Chinese that I have come across. It has by far the best Grammer/Vocab and the best notes that tell you more about China.The only choice for someone learning Chinese.
4,"Very good, but try the New Practical Chinese Reader instead","This is the old Practical Chinese Reader, and while it is very good, the New Practical Chinese Reader (Volume 1: 7561910401) is much better; try that instead."
2,autodidactic weaknesses,This book is not entirely suitable for people who want to study on their own. There are no answers provided for the exercises so there is no way of checking whether they are right or wrong.
3,Widely used but not as useful,"This book is widely used as a course text, but there are more useful books for those interested in learning Mandarin Chinese. It is a much better series than most when third or fourth year studies are reached."
2,IT's not easy to pass CCDA exam with this study guide!,"I just passed the CCDA exam today. However, I found that this study guide is not enough to pass the exam. The case studies in this book are only for high school students, not for cisco professionals who want to know more netwok design...hard to pass the CCDA exam with this book!"
2,Cut and Paste,"Much of this book is clearly a cut and paste job from the same author's CCNA study guide. Sometimes that is good because a lot of the material is similar. Other times it is really irritating when the author refers to something from chapter 5, but it is chapter 5 of the CCNA book. There were a number of errors in the questions where the provided answers were wrong, or at least they seemed wrong. I used this book primarily and some sources from the web to get a 931 and pass the CCDA exam, but I was very disappointed with the quality of this book"
2,Not a good prep for the actual eaxm......,"Compared to the authors CCNA book, this one was not close to the materials on the actual exam. The review questions were horrible."
4,"MBECKHAM, Ashburn, VA. CCNA/CCDA - Excellent Book!","I passed the CCDA two weeks ago on first try. It was challenging. You must know the information and be able to apply it to the case studies. Plain and simple If you don't know it you won't pass. I'm not a fan necessarily of Todd Lammle, but of good study guides. Regardless of who publishes them. Todd lays it out for you. You have to go get it! This is an excellent book. This was my main source, but I also used CISCO, A beginners guide, MASONTECH web site and the CISCO web site. I'm not just looking for some quickie cert, but build a solid foundation in order o become a great CCIE. Be a student of CISCO, don't look for some quick fix. There aren't any! Use all of your resources for exam preparation and you will do fine."
1,Why so many people compare this book with the Cisco book?,I knew nothing about the Cisco's CCDA book. But I do know that this Sybex book will NOT prepare you adequately for CCDA exam. I wrote the exam last week. Please do not trust those reviewers who give 5 stars to this book!
3,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly",Good thing about this book is that it is not lengthy. Bad is that it has several typo's and incorrect acronym's. It also wasn't detailed enough to describe certain chapters of the Cisco DCN literature. Ugly is that I actually passed the exam. I also used the study guide from crmasession and reviewed all of the Cisco documents from the study guide. Good Luck
2,"CCDA: Cisco Certified Design Associate Study Guide, 2nd Edit",I used Todd's CCNA study guide to pass the CCNA test and found it excellent. This one however is sorely lacking (for 640-861). Many topics covered are not required and more importantly others are missing completely or not covered sufficiently. You would be better off with the recently released Cisco Press self study quide.
3,"Easy to read, but not complete materials","I just passed CCDA with my first try (score 902). I like the cases in this book. Definitely be familiar with them. I got almost idenfical case in the exam (of course, different questions). But this book will not prepare you fully for this exam if you are new to network, like me. I also read CCDA book from Cisco press (by Kim). Another suggestion is getting your CCNA first. I read Todd Lammle's CCNA book (that one is good) before, and found out that half of the CCDA book are exactly the same as the CCNA one(even the jokes are the same). So if you already have the CCNA book from Lammle, please don't buy this one. Buy the Cisco one."
2,Easy Reading book for 50% coverage on the exam,This book is only good for 50% coverage on the exam. I thought it was as good as the CCNA one but I guess I was wrong. Although I did pass the CCDA exam with this book but most of the answer came from prior knowledge and other books that I've read for my CCNP. Don't count on it if you are new to the Cisco products.
2,Not happy this time...,"I used this book to study for the CCDA, I have a lot of respect for Todd Lammle but this book lacked some vital information for the exam in my view. It lacked detailed info on appletalk and x.21. The layout of the book is good and I have been buying these sybex books right through my MCSE but I will be buying the Cisco press books for the rest of my Cisco studies."
1,And they Published this thing?,"I was throughly not impressed with this book, i already have the ccna book which was far more helpful than this waste of paper, this book had one section that actualy covered topics on the exam, but it fell short, real short of actualy covering any of the information on the exam, i studied using this book as well as my ccna book as well as online study materials, if you want to pass this exam and actualy have a knowledge of ccda, use the cisco press books far more informative and you will actualy learn how to design customer networks. I passed my ccda exam with a 854 and this book was absolutly NO help at all. This book was definatly no where near the quality of the ccna book by Lammle, very disapointing, to say the least.....if you are looking for ccda books this definatly does not fit the bill."
1,Not sufficient enough to pass the exam with,This book is garbage. It doesn't come close to fulfilling the exam objectives. The test prep software is a joke. VoIP and IPv6 are severely lacking as these two subjects constituted a good chunk of the exam. Too many pages written on subjects that weren't part of the exam (the trivial introductory stuff) and not enough pages devoted to the important stuff.This was my first certification. I posted a decent score but not enough to pass. VoIP and IPv6 hurt me. I'll never use a Sybex book as source again. The other user reviews were right; I should have listened. One more thing learned the hard way...I'm going to try the Teare book next.
4,Helpfull but not the Holy Grail,"I used Lammle's CCNA book to help prep for the CCNA certification and was not disappointed. Unfortunately this CCDA book did not measure up (as far as the 640-441 exam). Despite my cirticism I will say I would not have passed without it. If you're just buying this book to pass a test, go elsewhere, it only covered 20-30% of the exam material (or at least the test version I had). It did contain a wealth of information that is useful on a daily basis especially if you need a good review of the basic concepts. The Sybex/Lammle format is easy to follow and there was not too much superfluous information to get lost in. A good review of technologies you may not work with on daily basis. Usually it is these items that trip you up on the exams. While I would buy Lammle again I've decided to give Newcomb's CIT book a try for both continuing to build my knowledge and moving up the CCNP ladder."
3,"Decent, mixed feelings","All in all a good book for CCDA preparation. I found it got a bit TOO technical given the scope of the actual exam which I just passed. Needs some refinement, but if you have attended DCN it's worth the money as a refresher. I am doubtful that I would have passed with this book alone however."
3,Beware this exam,I passed this exam by using the Designing Cisco Networks book by Cisco. This book though intensive was a very good study guide an prepared me very well for the exam but it is not easy to just pick up and read. I have read the Lammle book and do not feel that it adequately prepares you for all facets of this exam. If you have a good understanding of design then this test will be a little easier than it will be for most. I would not recommend that you read Lammle's study guide alone. His text builds on the fact that you have previous knowledge covered in the CCNA study guide which may or may not be true. I passed this exam with a 903/1000. I have some previous design experience and I will be the first to tell you that this test is not easy....
3,"Be warned, not that easy.","CCDA exam must be tougher than CCNA. It covers more area of networking. Studying with this book only won't lead you to the promised land. Althou this book is easy to read, it doesn't cover technical details you really need. Even if you passed the exam only with this book, better study with DCN course text or CCDA exam cert guide. Or you'll be in a big trouble in the real network world. Being lucky in exam does't mean being lucky in job."
4,"In Depth, but needed?","I studied this book beginning about a month out from my CCDA test. It goes IN DEPTH, but it's organized very well in my opinion. DO THE CASE STUDIES. You've got to be able to apply this knowledge, because the test won't ask you directly about split horizon explicitly, but it is assumed you will be able to apply what you've learned out of this book. You may not see a lot of the things from this book on the test, but you need to learn 'em anyway. No paper certs for me! This book will be with me throughout my career. Well done."
4,Buy the Book pass the test,Its that simple. Lays every thing out for you. The only subject it didn't cover well was SNA and Token Ring info was light. The CD is a great study tool.
4,This book helped.,This book is a good source of additional practice questions on design scenarios. Try to review it with Cisco's DCN kit if you can have one. Having both reviewers and good study discipline should prepare you. A CCNA belt and exposure to real life network designs would make your review a bit simpler.
1,Lacks several areas,This book is surprisingly not the same quality as the CCNA/NP books. It definitely does not cover all areas of the CCDA exam. I actually failed the exam because several subjects were not even covered in the book. The review questions are poorly written and the test on the CD contains wrong answers.
4,"Very good, but observed a discrepancy","One of the review questions at the end of Chpt 1 (or 2) asks: What does the 'D' in CSU/DSU stand for? This book answer is 'data'. However on page 10, first paragraph of Cisco's 'Designing Cisco Networks' book, it defines CSU/DSU with the 'D' standing for digital. Otherwise, book is excellent. Used Todd's CCNA guide to earn my CCNA. Excellent resources."
3,CCDA:Cisco Certiified Design Associate Study Guide,"Disappointed in the book. I used Todd Lammie' book on CCNA and found it to be extremly helpful. The one feature that is missing that helped so much in the other book is that the book itself is not on the CD. When taking the test, a link to the appropriate chapter was extremely helpful Also the ability to read the book on the computer where the font can be enlarged and reading made easier would have increased my rating of it."
2,A good book that does not cover everything.,"This book is very good for beginners that need the basics. However if you plan on taking the test from this book, think again. The book only covers in detail about half of what is on the test. The rest of what is on the test this book just skims over. Use the CCO in addition to the book or get a different book."
1,Stick with Cisco Press,Don't buy this book. It doesn't flow well and it doesn't give you enough detail on the specific Cisco model numbers. I made it through all 12 chapters and knew that I was not prepared for the test. I had to go buy the Cisco press book also and study it on top of the Sybex book. It pushed my test back a couple weeks. I have used Sybex books in the past and they have been good. This one misses the mark entirely!
3,Doesn't cover the scope of the exam,"I just passed the CCDA yesterday. If you are going to buy one book for the CCDA test, then buy the Cisco Press Book by Kim.Nothing against Todd Lammle, this book is well written and a valuable source of information. But it does not cover all the information that Cisco wants you to know for the CCDA test.I found Lammle's CCNA book to be invaluable for that test (which I just passed several weeks ago). But this book is lacking in areas such as: 1. Cisco's approach to designing a ""cisco network solution"" 2. It does not cover the ""cisco"" product line as much as I would have liked, as I do not have a ton of experience with their products. 3. Many of the questions in the review sections and CD tests are extremely poorly worded and very vague.In my opinion the Cisco Press book (by Kim) does a much, much better job at covering this material."
5,Best CCDA available,"Don't waste your money on the Cisco self-study, nor the Cisco Press book. They are both over priced and worthless. If you want to know what to expect for the CCDA exam, then this is your book. Easy to read and understand, and I also found the reveiw questions were mostly the same as the real exam. Made it even easier."
1,Waste of money and time,"I've used the CCNP Sybex book to pass CCNP easily, I've been a Cisco engineer for 9 years and I failed a CCDA with this book.I questioned my sanity. But sure enough the book doesn't cover the material. In fact it missses out MOST of the exam topics.Score less than the required 825 with this book.It's not just the books fault though. The exam is a classic Cisco foul up with answers being ambiguous as hell. A bit like the original CCNA for those that failed that one. You are not alone.I'm off to buy the 'top down' networking manual from Cisco Press as that's what they used to write the exam. that's why Cisco don't allow you to take the exam again for 3 days, so you can realise you had the wrong study guide.Bitter - YesTwisted - maybe."
5,Great Price for this item,Items where delivered faster then expected and they where as described plus worked exceptionally well for the price (seeing as how in the stores it's around $30 bucks for one) just make sure you put the bait in the middle of the trap so the critter you are trying to catch isn't getting the food through the air holes i caught two on my first nightP.S Sorry for the grammar I'm writing this from my mobile phone
2,"Good idea, hasn't worked for me though","I have this other kind of trap (aHavahart Live Animal Double Door Cage Trap for Mice and Chipmunks #1020) and it is pretty effective, but only traps one at a time and it has to be emptied and reset. So I thought this one would be much easier to deal with. Unfortunately the mice around here don't seem to like it, or they don't find the entrance. I have not caught a single mouse with it."
3,Sometimes works,I have purchased three of these and found that mice can still get out. I have caught mice with it so it does work but not 100%. More like 40% of the time. I have used the plastic mice traps and found the same problem...mice find a way to pull down on the door to get out. The only 100% is with glue traps or poison. I may have to go to that.
1,Plenty of mice... None caught,"I have two of these and neither has caught a mouse yet. I've also been sporadically using poison in the same areas and it's being completely eaten right away but I really don't like the poison idea for many reasons. Out of desperation, I bought a hav-a-heart trap and put it right next to the tin cat. Morning one, there's a quivering little guest in the hav-a-heart and nothing but crackers, peanut butter, and chocolate in the tin cat. I wish I could figure this out because the hav-a-heart can only trap one at a time plus the mouse can escape if the doors don't close all the way. The tin cat looks like a great idea but I've been wondering if my particular mice are too large for it."
1,Must depend on the mind-set of your mice,"I notice from reviews that this trap seems to work very well for some people, and hardly or not at all for others. I'm in the latter category. Two nights so far with two traps have caught nothing. First night with one Electronic trap caught a mouse. Same bait (peanut butter) same general location. Looks like Tin Cat ought to work, but so far hasn't for me. My guess is that different colonies of mice have different attitude to the sort of entrance this trap presents. No way to tell ahead of time if ""your"" mice will enter this trap or not.I'm also uneasy about how humane this trap really is. I suspect that house mice released in the wild don't fare very well. The Electronic trap can only get one mouse at a time, but death is probably instantaneous. Speaking for myself, I'd rather be killed by a high-voltage discharge than be eaten by an owl."
2,*eventually* effective,"Apparently, all it takes is a bad review and the mice come running. If you're going to bait it, I suggest putting it right in the middle. I think they were trying to reach in through the air holes on the side and didn't even acknowledge the trap entrance.-- Original review Below --After reading all the positive reviews, I expected quick results.For whatever reason, the mice won't go near this thing. I've tried putting bait right outside of it, and a ton of stuff inside to get them in. Cheese, Fruit, Peanut Butter - nothing works. They just won't go into the trap. They take the stuff outside, but won't go inside. Maybe the mice here are too fat to fit. ""WARNING: NOT SUITABLE FOR OVERWEIGHT MICE"". I don't know."
4,Ok,"It's ok, I haven't caught any mice yet but then again I haven't in the snap traps either. I was very excited about getting this trap, since I wanted to have a bunch of live mice to let go over that the house of my coworker who carpools with me, since he has 8 dogs, 20 cats, chincillas, rabbits, ferrets, and god knows what else living over there. It was my whole goal, and I was giddy upon getting the traps and setting them, in the feverish hope that I would have a batch of them to toss out as he opened the car door. Alas, twas not meant to be, but I am still glad, for it means I don't have many or any mice and I will one day still have the joy of trapping him some new little occupants."
5,caught 7 at one time!,"Gross, I know, but had this trap out for about a week with PB and bread inside. Put it where I've seen the mice (kitchen). One day, came home from work, to find SEVEN baby mice inside. I let them go and put it back, only to catch another one (I think the mom) an hour later. This trap was awesome!"
1,No mice,"I bought two Victor brand Tin Cat, Clear Top, mouse traps. Placed them in different places in the home, mostly along the walls, where I know mice are running. I was using either no bait or different baits; crackers, cookies, raisons, candy, peanut butter, seeds. So far, no mice have entered these traps. Still finding mouse droppings, so I know they are around, but they are avoiding these traps. So far, I can say that this type and brand is not working for me."
4,Effecient Trap,"Like a mouse hotel, I caught voles as well. Effective to view thru top. Outdoor suitable and easy disposal.American made!!!!"
2,Still can't recommend.,"Not impressed with the quality of Intex products. Wish I had checked out the BBB Los Angeles website before purchasing to see that their efforts to resolve a complaint end as ""Refuse to adjust, relying on terms of agreement"" the majority of the time."
5,EAST SET POOL SET,"This is our 3rd pool. If you take care of it, it will last a long time. wonderful deal in free shipping."
3,Fun Times,"The pool is super easy to set up and my kids really like the it. While they may already be 15 and 12 years old, they are excited to cool off in the pool. The younger kids next door have enjoyed it too. Since we live in an area where outdoor pools are only practical for a short time, this is a great alternative and will be easy to store for next year.My only concern is that if a child is tool small to ""step"" over the top of the pool, they may fall in."
5,EXTREMELY PLEASED,"...It took my husband about 30 minutes to set up and start filling it. Our back yard isn't completly level but it works great. When we put it up next season we will try to get the ground more level. We don't have any complaints as of yet. We have five chlidren 6,9,10,11,and,12 years of age. They love it! For the price it is worth it. As far as other complaints...You get what you pay for. It takes common sense. The pool is made of plastic. If you go into this with the expectations of the durability of a built in pool you are going to be disapointed. Even if I had to replace the whole pool every summer, it is affordable and worth it. The pump is so quiet you won't have any complaints from neighbors. The pool cover is also great. We love it! I hope this review helps. Thanks!"
4,Supplies,"Having bought and set up this pool,I found that the retailer,Toys-R-US, could not supply the needed chemicals or the replacement filter cartridge that the manufacturer recommends to replace every two weeks"
1,Dont order this pool!,"We set this up, and it leaked all around the seam! We tried refilling the intertube part, it leaked again all around the seam! We're out our money because we bought it on clearance last year. DONT BOTHER!"
1,not safe for toddlers,"We loved the pool (3' x 12') until my kids got comfortable with the pool. My 2 year old daughter (who weighs 27 pounds) put her weight on the side of the pool edge. In doing so, she collapsed the edge washing her and some of the pool water out of the pool. She was terrified as was her sister. After this, we took the pool down and gave it away to friends who do not have children. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else."
5,"It's not a ten min. job, but worth the extra effort","Finding the right location is the key. The spot you choose must be level. Once that is done the rest is cake. I'm a single mom and I put the pool together in about an hour and a half. The leveling took 2 days! Still theres no sand needed and the ground cover that was included is perfact.This pool is very easy to maintain,but if you hang on the sides of the pool ( like kids do ) you could very easily lose gallons of water and if your on a spring or well it's important to know."
2,Beware the hot sun.,"I live in Phoenix, which has a habit of getting over 110 on a regluar basis in the summer. After having this pool for a few days, the first thing I noticed was that the water quickly became too hot to swim in (mine got to just over 100 degrees). But the next problem was the dealbreaker. With the sun beating down on the pool, the outside of the PVC lining and the floating ring got extremely hot to the touch. After a few days, the seams began to pull apart on the side of the pool that was facing the sun, as if the adhesive used to bond the seams was failing. Eventually, the pool burst open.So in theory, this pool is a good value. The filter worked well (you can buy replacement filters at walmart or target), and it was easy to set up. The water depth is usually 6-9 inches less than the stated depth of the pool, and the actual diameter is actually a few feet less than the stated diameter (the pool tapers inward toward the top). Just beware of the sun!"
2,"Easy set pool, 24 foot","This pool was a nightmare to set up! I guarantee you, it will not be the ""30 minutes and ready for water"" as advertised. The ground must be perfectly level and you will need at least 4 or 5 adults to set it up correctly. It is next to impossible to get all the wrinkles out of the bottom. And yes, you will need sand. (and lots of it!) It is also dangerous if anyone leans on the walls from the outside or inside, as the walls easily collapse and let a flood of water come pouring out. The filter pump that is supplied with the pool is too small to do an effecient job of cleaning. All in all, this started out to be a $800.00 investment in summer fun and has ended up being a $1000.00 nightmare of stress! Run the other way!"
1,Beware Intex Pools!!! Low Quality!!!,"I first owned a 12x30 Intex Pool that lasted for 4 years without any leaks or any other issues. After the fourth season the pool started to fall apart. I thought that 4 seasons was outstanding for a $100 pool. Based on this, I purchased another Intex Pool. This time I bought the 15x36 pool. I noticed that the quality was not even close to the first Intex pool I owned. Nonetheless the pool worked great for 1 season. However, I just started to set the pool up today after properly drying and storing for the winter. Upon filling the pool up, it was literally falling apart. I lost count at 12 holes. The material of this pool is very low quality and not designed to be folded without cracking. It is only good for one season. STAY AWAY FROM INTEX unless you only plan on only using it for one season. IT WILL NOT SURVIVE WINTER STORAGE. JUNK! JUNK!JUNK!"
2,Had hoped for a more aesthetically pleasing book,"The photos are quite poor - usually grainy, a bit out of focus, sort of amateurish...that is my main complaint. This is also a thin book - not a lot of information for the price. Considering the lack of information on the subject, though, it might be worth buying if you are interested in the Taos people and pueblo."
1,Poor,"The product was pretty shoddy, and nothing was included to hang them up, requiring three more sets of orders from different companies, with nothing working."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this product. It seemed cheaply made. Some of the wood was split or damaged. I don't think this product would have lasted outdoors. Amazon was great in taking the product back and giving me a refund.
1,A piece was broken off of the planter's bottom,"A piece was broken off of the planter's bottom and was not in the packaging which leads me to believe whoever shipped the item knew it was damaged when it was shipped. Since it is an outdoor item I will keep it and repair the damage. Looking at the product, it appears too fragile to ship in just a box with no instruction on handling with care. I orderex a total of 5 boxes in varying sizes and they all some degree of damage or imperfection."
5,Alter Eco Red Quinoa,"Wonderful flavor. Great in everything. I cook up a bunch and keep it on hand in the fridge for salads, soups, etc. I'd recommend it to anyone."
5,Amazing grain,"This is one of the best ""new"" foods I have ever tried. Delicious, versatile, and easy to cook, Quinoa will be a staple in my household from now on. It cooks just like rice and can be flovored in the pot with a bit of broth, chopped onions or other vegies...but it doesn't really need a thing. We started tasting it the first time we made it right out of the pan still on the stove, and before long we had eaten it all. Plain. What a great side dish.I was impressed with the shipping speed and packaging from Alter Eco. And their business concept makes me feel good about doing business with them."
5,Superfood made easy,I love the flavor of this quinoa. The color is a nice addition to salads and other dishes. Cooking healthy made easy.
3,OK,video was fine would have wanted to buy just the one disk I wanted the rest of the second season where not my favorites
5,Best of the Best,"This season was the best of them all.I watched the entire season all in one weekend...I couldn't stop it! Don't read the episide synopses before watching them...be surprised! I certainly was. There are so many smaller stories within the big picture...So much happens in each episode. Not one character is left out.The bond between the gang is closer...There is so much more emotion...Moving away, babies, death, mystery. I don't want to spill the beans...Buy it!!! You'll LOVE IT!!!"
5,Change of Mind,"When Roswell became a hit back in 1999, i was still a lil kid. i thought what everyone else thot. it was stupid. i never watched it when it aired on the Wb or Upn. I saw a little bit of it but only when tess kissed max. but about a year ago, i stumbled on it on the sci fi network. it was interesting and i started to watch it in march. so everyday after school, i'd come home and watch it and waiting and i couldn't believe how good it was. all of my friends and family got concerned when i would search online about it and just talk about it. now everyone thinks i'm that girl dat likes aliens. but its really good. i got hooked. i cried, i laughed, it was so suspenseful. i got seven other people to watch it and they loved it. my favorite season is season 3 but this is also the best!"
5,Probably best season of the show..,"I wish there were more special features or more commentary. I guess that's what I get for it being an early 2000's show. But definitely love it, not too far fetched, I mean besides the aliens. Shiri and Jason have great chemistry. Also, great to see actors before they really became famous."
4,"Great Episode, Great Series","From the beginning, Roswell immediately captured its viewers with a sequence of thrilling and mysterious events involving the unveiling of teenage aliens, or so they seemed. This episode does not disappoint, as it stays true to the expectations of such an amazing series.The only problem with it is a small one. This episode is out of sequence with the others. As you can see, the Air date is May 14, 2001. This would make it the 20th episode of the season, after ""Baby, It's You"" and before ""The Departure"".This is a quick fix, and hopefully it will be remedied soon.Overall, I love the story and adore the series."
3,Not what I expected,"The description said ""Very Good"" condition and that is not how i received it. At best I would describe it as good. The box had a LOT of wear and the upon inspection the discs had some type of gunk on them. I ended up having to clean all six. On the other hand the inside disc cases are in excellent condition. I haven't played all of the DVDs as I just got them today, but so far what I have played hasn't messed up. All in all I would say that for about $10 I got what I payed for. Still upset at the false advertising though."
2,Not even close to season 1,"I became a fan of this show after watching season 1. I'm a few discs into season 2 now, and am wondering what happened to the show. It's become cheesy and it's as if the writers wrote for season 2 as a part time side job. The story line is all over the place. The acting has suffered. This season is a huge let down."
3,I wish I would have stopped at season one,"I bought Roswell season one and loved it! I shared it with friends and they loved it too. Then I started season 2. At first I liked it, not as much as season one, but it was still good, then half way through I stopped liking where it was going. Part of what I love in Roswell is the relationship between Max and Liz and this season just took it apart too much for me. I hate Tess' character and it was not in a love to hate sort of way, it too much to where it just made the show not enjoyable to watch.So to sum up Season 1 - amazing, Season 2 - not so much."
5,The Second Season is Great!,"It had some eps that i loved, like the christmas Nazi :-) and some very exciting ones with laurie duprie and the skins. Best of all in season 2 they put in extras for the fans and behind the scenes stuff. That was great to see the actors so happy offset it lets you know the love doing the show and interacting with the other actors. :-) I can't wait for season 3!"
3,"5/5 for the set, 1/5 for the useless repackaging","Of all 3 seasons of Roswell, the second is my favorite. The first was more of Dawson's Creek with a sci-fi twist and the third just got too weird, but season 2 was near perfection. The story arcs are wonderful, and the addition of Emilie de Ravin to the main cast might have been the best thing to happen to Roswell. Plus, the widescreen presentation gives a great theatrical feel to the show. The only thing that bugs me is that I don't get why Fox had to re-release these sets, other than being another way to suck money out of loyal fans."
2,Roswell - The Complete Second Season,"i'm very disappointed, because in dics 5, it's hang, so i don't know the episodes in dics 5"
5,Roswell,I used to watch Roswell when it first came out and when i saw that AMAZON had all three seasons i ordered the two i didn't have and my boyfriend and I are hooked. We watched them all within a month. The delivery from amazon was fast and the dvds were awesome. I will definately order more from AMAZON again.
5,The series has landed,I was so glad that this great tv show received a 2nd season so that i may experience the excitement and drama that happened in Roswell all over again. I loved this shows 1st season and couldn't have been more thrilled about the 2nd season. An extremely original show.
4,It's Great! DYING for season 3!,"Season 2 is much more intense and darker than the first. But equally good! I'm just waiting for the 3rd season to be out... i know its out in the UK and am tempted to order it from there! So if any of you have any news on season 3, please do tell!"
3,Great 1st season but the second was lacking,"Warning: If you have not seen the second season on TV or know what happens, do not read the reviews. The reviews are full of spoilers and can really ruin the show for the first time viewer.This review is pretty much spoiler free :)Just a short blurb: If you liked the first season get the second but if you don't know what happens in the second DO NOT READ THE BACK OF THE BOX. There is a giant spoiler there which really ruined much of the suprise.Ok on to the dvd review:The second season had a lot going for it but fell apart due to giant gaping plot holes and an inconsistent storyline. There are major events that unfold in season two but they really don't happen until the 5 or 6 episodes. IMHO the end of the season seemed rushed and kind of thrown together by the writers. I am actually suprised that the show lasted for 3 seasons. As I have only seen the show on DVD I don't know if it improves.DVD extras are ok, but this is really not a factor for me."
3,hope you didn't like the music...,"Part of the magic of this show was the music. Season 2 was a big season for fans of the sci-fi aspect of the show. but if you were an avid viewer, the change of music will be very diappointing. i'm not trying to bash a show which was at one time my favourite, i'm just saying that the dvd suffers alot without the original songs in place. BIG disappointment when you think you are buying something and you get something else. This ranks up there with george ""sellout"" lucas messing with Star Wars.. but thats another review.OverallPicture quality - 9 out of 10Sound Quality - 8 out of 10Music - 2 out of 10Special Features - 6 out of 10Menus - 4 out of 10Package Design - 9 out of 10"
4,"Good, but not as good as Season 1","I loved Rosewell, and the season was great, but i hated Tess, and I really don't think they needed her in it. I think having Tess in it, ruined it."
5,A Truly Unforgettable Series,"I find that these days it's so hard to find a show that affected me the way Roswell did and still does. Every monday night, my heart would pound in anticipation of the upcoming episode that evening, and I would daydream about it most of the following day. This is especially true of season 2. The twists and turns of plot kept me on the edge of my seat, made me laugh harder than ever before, and sometimes, broke my heart. Of all of the shows that have come and gone in my lifetime, this is the one I miss the most. I will treasure these dvd's for the rest of my life."
2,Whats the diff??,"What different from this box set and i one i already own. There is no mention of any extras.So I guessing it just the cover art?Love Roswell,love Kate Heigl but i won't be buying new sets just for some new cover art with her more to the front and telling me she's an emmy winner!"
2,Misleading,"I actually bought this book at a real store. My major complaint is that NOWHERE on the jacket or inside flaps is any mention that is is book 4 in a series. That is very annoying since I had to locate the other 3 books first in order to fully appreciate this novel. I don't think it reads too well as a stand-alone story. Aside from that complaint, I found the story, characters, etc... to be compelling."
3,"Good, but not great","Having enjoyed ""The Cassini Division"" and ""The Stone Canal"", I was looking forward to this book with great expectations. Unfortunately, it came up somewhat short. That's not to say it's a bad book; but it isn't as intellectually stimulating, or as entertaining as its predecessors.As usual, the writing is elegant, and generally superb. The story is well plotted, and moves along at a reasonable pace. However, when all was said and done, I didn't really feel like I had gone anywhere by reading this book. The story was entertaining, but there was no real climax, and hence no real resolution.Perhaps that is what Macleod was striving for; a vehicle to develop characters for future works. If that is the case, he succeeded admirably. I suspect that this is a novel that will always be regarded in the context of his other works, rather than on its own merits.Still, I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes their science fiction on the serious side."
2,MacLeod loses his way...,"Thinly plotted, poor characterisation and utterly self-indulgent. What a disappointment this book was. Quite clearly Ken had a couple of good ideas and attempted to build a novel around them. It didn't work, and the whole enterprise seemed to lack vision and depth. Sorry to be so negative, but that's my honest opinion."
5,You never know what you have till it's gone.,This is excellent for pest control. I bought when I first got houseplants to ward off pests. It worked like a charm. I didn't appreciate it until I tried a few other products and lost a few plants to spider mites. I bought this again and they are all gone know after two applications. From what I've read it's not toxic to bees and a good natural pesticide. Some sites say the Neem extract is not as good but I worked like a charm for me.
3,Worked Okay BUt Smelled Very Strong,"I used it on stink bugs that were invading my home, and it did stop them well, but for waht I thought was an organic product, this had a very strong chemical odor."
3,A bit confused?,"I see some reviews saying to wash your plants/leaves after application, but no where does it say this on the bottle. I read the label backwards and forwards three times - in fact, it says not to apply when rain is expected within 24 hours, which would kind of defeat the purpose of washing off leaves. It does say to not apply in the middle of the day in direct sunlight, but that's it. I'm not sure where others are getting that the plants need to be washed, because it's not on the instructions/label.Also, for those reviews that mention ""organic"" - this is NOT an organic product. Direct from the Green Light website:""Neem II Ready to Use (RTU) is not organic."""
4,Myths on Motherhood,An overall solid book on motherhood. It is written from the author's perspective and I used it throughout my global humanities class on motherhood.
4,One of a Kind,"The first time I've read Karl Moore's tutorials of Visual Basic on VB-World.com, he never fails to amuse me. The way he writes is different from all the authors. He uses a technique wherein the reader will never be bored on a certain topic if it gets technical. When I've seen his book about VB.Net I don't have second thought about buying this book. I knew this book is going to be a great one and my assumptions are correct.He still uses the same funny technique which I like. It tackles a wide area about VB.Net including ASP.Net and mobile technologies of it, (this is the part that I love). But of course every book is not perfect there are some codes that I've encountered which doesn't work (page 203). But the rest is great. If you are new to VB, expert on VB, begging on VB.Net or an expert, I recommend you to buy this book."
5,"Instant delivery, great job","I took this book on holiday with me to Majorca.. it was fantastic to read a tutorial book without having to even be in front of the computer. Mr Moore teaches in a way that makes you read and want to learn more. If you're new, or are porting to .NET, this is the book you HAVE to buy!! (ps. it arrived next day for me)"
2,I am returning my copy of this book,"I am a programmer, familiar with old fashion languages and having had some experience with ASP, SQL Server, Access.The book has some useful information and tips, shows where to start. However, it is only a set of quick tutorials and I had to order a solid beginner's book anyway.I find the author's abundant humor very simplistic and annoying. For example when he returns to button control this is what his readers get, ""Okay, so you've seen this one before, but I'm feeling repetitive. Repetitive. Repetitive. What, not even a sympathy laugh? Sheesh. That's the thanks you get. Anyway, it's a button. You click it; it does stuff. Whoop-de-doo."" Then there is list of 5 key properties, 2 key methods, 2 key events and one line of sample code. No explanation provided for any of them.I don't know why this book got a lot of positive comments."
2,VB.NET As Jay Leno Would Present It,"This is book is not for professional programmers or serious students. Beginners may get value from it if they can put up with the author's silliness, which goes on and on. The author's style reminds me of the early ""For Dummies"" books. I was surprised that Apress, normally a good source for computer professionals, published this book.If you believe that watching Jay Leno is the way to stay informed about key issues, then this may be for you."
2,too many lame jokes,"If you took all of the lame jokes out of this book, it would only be about 30 pages long. I recommend the beginner's book from the Microsoft Press. It covers the same topics more thoroughly and doesn't treat the reader like a third grader."
5,Beautifully Done!,"I'm not new to VB programming, but like many, the transition from VB6 to .NET was not only frustrating, but also downright intimidating. This book does an excellent job of dispelling so many fears of the new platform and beautifully sets developers on the proper path.Every other programming book I've purchased, I inevitably find myself thinking, ""Dear God... this is such long reading!"" Not so in this case. My only disappointment is that it comes in only one volume. I find myself repeatedly picking it up in hopes of finding one more morsel I may have missed the first time around. Karl Moore's excitement about programming is contagious, his TIPS and HOW-TO's are fantastic, and throughout it all... he proves to us that writing sophisticated applications for the web, windows, or whatever you goal, is really not rocket science after all."
5,LILLIAN IS THE BEST!!!,"LILLIAN IS A VERY GENEROUS PERSON TO SHARE HER INSIGHTS, EXPERIENCE AND AMAZING RISE TO STARDOM. FENG SHUI MASTERS DOESN'T SHARE ABOUT FENG SHUI MAGIC BECAUSE IT REALLY IS POTENT. FOR PEOPLE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE YET ...LUCK HAS NOT KNOCK YET."
5,Best book I've read this year!,"Personally, I think that ""Children Of Amarid"" is one of the best novels that I've read in a while. Coe has an amazing way of creating characters & plots. You can just see Baden, Jaryd, Alayna & Satrol pop up out of the pages. In a single novel he creted a countries religion & history, a new form of magic, amazing characters, a war between two lands, and numerous other things that have taken other book series at least 4 novels. I give this book a perfect 5 due to its amazing writing & I deeply anticipate ""The Outlanders."""
2,"Not bad, but nothing to throw a party over","I see i'm to be the first to give this a bad review. the book was ok, but thats about it. the characters were developed just enough to make you interested but not enough to really satisfy the avid reader or to clearly define them. Coe posesses some talent with writing, but lacks any true zest. Most of his twists and surprizes are seen comming a mile away and do little to improve the reading. The magic system is about the most generic i've ever seen. They can throw color coded fire, heal, and see through the eyes of their familiars... is this all? is there more? whats the source? the book was definatly a step above the Dragonlance dime a dozen tripe, but it fell short of being anything that will leave a lasting impression. still, if you are waiting for something good to come out and have nothing aournd to read, head to your local used book store and give Mr. Coe a chance."
2,Not Good.,"This book's language was ok, it was very normal english that everybody could understand. Finding the traitor was completely predictable, when you read his mad eyes with the time he lets his mad face come out in a meeting to friends, it pretty much clinched it for me. Characters were very poorly developed. They were all completely perfect, except for one or two flaws that did not make them seem too perfect, but the flaws were small. The character was amazingly insightful to everything which seemed a bit to (sorry to say this again) perfect for me. I almost bought the rest of the books in the trilogy, but lucky for me they did not have them in stock. It's 2 stars instead of one, because the last 20 pages were actually a little bit interesting."
2,Slightly disappointing,"I read this a long time ago. I remember that I found this book to be pretty well written, but rather simplistic and predictable. I am not going to read the sequel. Hopefully, his other work is better."
4,thrilling heart pumping saga,"""this is a great book for fantasy lovers, it has an unexpected twist that every one will love. there is a great deal of action non-stop through the last part."""
2,Terrible Kindle Implementation,"I've read this book a couple of times, and I give the fiction itself 3.5 to 4 stars.However, this Kindle implementation is awful. Multiple syllable words that end in ""her"" or ""hers"" are always separated into two words. feather becomes ""feat her,"" gather becomes ""gat her."" In a book with so many birds in it, the feather problem is especially annoying.There are other errors as well, particularly with some contractions that end in ""t"". ""hadn't helped"" became ""hadn'Thelped.""I enjoyed the story, but the publisher (or whomever) has mangled the kindle version. It distracts from an otherwise enjoyable book."
3,ok...,I was quite disappointed with this novel. I didnt like how the story seemed very childish. The dialogue was terrible... I mean absolutely dreadful... It was very predictable and not really worth the time i put into reading it. I guess i was entertained by it... but i dont know if i would recommend it to anyone other than those looking for something to pass the time.
2,Good story but missing much,"Like some other reviews, I agree that David Coe tells a good story. I especially like how you get to know his characters by their thoughts/words. Plus, he is descriptive w/o being too windy (take note Stephen Donaldson).The main problem I have is he NEVER explains how this magic works. We know that the mages get their power when they bond with a hawk or owl (owls being more powerful?); but we don't know how this bond gives magic, how it is used, why the birds are necessary, etc...I just started the 2nd book and it doesn't seem to rely on this much, but I can't say for sure yet. If it doesn't, then i believe it will be a better book."
5,You Got To Read This Book!!!!!!!!!!,This one of few book that I could not put down. It has a great charter mack up. It has all the thimgs that a great book should. It may be a long book but it was worth the long reading.
3,star wars vehicle trade federation armored assault tank,grandson who is 8 loved it but it didn't hold up to his playing only got to play with it abo a week
2,Good book for microsoft programmers,"This book is more focused on programming javascript for microsoft's IE. At the time of publication Netscape was still as prevalent as IE and hence (should have) made programmers decide to go with another book (to keep a cross browser focus). But now that IE has taken over (at the time of this review) this book can prove quite helpful.I would suggest the book: Beginning JavaScript (by Paul Wilton). This has more in-depth coverage and lots of great examples to get beginners, int, and adv. users moving quick. See that review."
2,Not all that useful,"A typical book from the ""Using"" series. Provides some helpful information for beginning programmers, but has an overall low content to mass ratio."
2,Disappointing,"As a both a fan of pokémon and creating crafts, I was somewhat disappointed with this product. First of all, I did not receive any ""sticker paper"" as promised in the product description. The next big disappointment occured when, after reading the fine print, I realized my printer was not reccommeded for use with the shrink sheet or sticker paper (had I recieved any,that is). Lexmark Jetprinter 2050 users, as well as HP DeskJet 1200/1600c users, beware."
2,unstable software,"I actually have the ""red"" version of this software (which Amazon does not sell) but assume the basic platform is the same. The software crashed my daughter's machine repeatedly; I had to load it on my own computer for her to finish her project. Even then, it crashed my machine as well, several times, before I finally cut-and-pasted her work into PowerPoint to get it printed. I'm uninstalling both copies - she had some fun with it, but it's not worth the aggravation."
3,Good program - no support,"Firstly, these programs (Red and Blue)are easy to use, and allow many creative projects as part of the Print Shop family.However, having bought these last Christmas, I have found that Mattel (owner of The Learning Co.) no longers offers support for these programs.Additionally, while they advertise that you must get both programs to ""get all the pokemon"" you can not share the graphics between the programs. This means that you must launch them separately and keep separate projects in order to use all the pokemon -- very unfriendly."
2,Angelina has a terrible attitude!!,I bought this book for my 4 year old daughter and did not get past the first few chapters. I have seen the cartoon and disliked it very much but had read reviews that suggested the books were better. Well they are not. I had to keep stopping reading to my daughter to explain that what Angelina was saying was not nice. If you care about raising polite and caring children I suggest you skip this book.
2,Dated Summary of Sports car Racing History,"Paging through this book quickly reveals how dated the material is. There are very many interesting historical details and a few pictures of cars such as the famous Porsche 917, Jaguar D-type, and Mercedes 300SL, however there is little in the way of actual design or construction information. Basic details such as type of chassis or suspension, and possibly output of an engine are the limit of detail. There are a few engineering details on materials and the like, familiar to anyone with anyone with a background in Mechanical engineering. If you are looking for a book that serves as a layman's guide to racing, there are many more up to date books, including an excellent book on Ferrari's dominating 2003 car, however this book is anything but a resource for the designer, more of a summary of the first 70 years of racing technology this century."
1,Lame & Cheezy,"Remember those Casio keyboards back in the 80's, with the cheesy built-in rhythm-section/chord-generator/arpeggiators? Imagine if they had had a setting for ""techno."" That's what every single track on this album sounds like. Textureless, unimaginative, jingly, boring, formulaic, BEEP BEEP BEEP techno. The music is just plain annoying. This album has no redeeming qualities whatsoever."
1,Don't buy this disc,These performances are subpar at best -- sloppy and under-rehearsed. Boulez's own recording of Rituel is vastly superior; sadly there are no alternatives to the other items on the disc. NB the tacking information for the Riehm and Lachenmann is reversed.
4,Who Kidnapped Kaspar Kenting?,"This is one of the last three mysteries of S.S. Van Dine. It is the mystery of the kidnaping of playboy Kaspar Kenting - who did it, and what are the family secrets involved in his kidnaping. It may be one of the last but it still shows the elaborate plotting of the earlier Philo Vance mysteries, though instead of endless deduction by Vance there are many more action scenes."
5,"Thanks, Lloyd!!","Once again, Lloyd Boston has written a book that is not only beautiful to look at, but filled with creative and insightful information. Reading it was as much fun as watching him on television! I especially liked the ""affirmations"" which connected great style, with great self-confidence! These are the kinds of messages that adult women, and young girls, should be exposed to as often and early as possible. Thanks, Lloyd!!"
1,don't bother,"There were 3 ideas worth reading: Get colored safety pins (black) for emergency repairs, try using a wire hangar hooked to the zipper tab to zip the back of a dress, and a white suit can be nearly as versatile as a black suit. Other than that there was a paucity of useful ideas and suggestions that haven't been put out in dozens of other (less expensive) books in the last few years. As another reviewer mentioned, there were a lot of pictures of the author, little in the way of helpful illustrations, and many ""experts"" touting their own line or cosmetic company. My pet peeve, insisting that everyone should wear heels, shows up constantly. After many severe ankle injuries, this just isn't possible, and I know I am not the only one with physical issues preventing heels. Don't bother, it's all been said before."
1,Before You Put That On,The book was a complete disappointment. I bought one for me and one for my daughter...we both returned them
2,What a waste of paper!!!,I saw his appereance in the Oprah show doing all this makeovers and making excellent suggestions...I go get the book and it was a complete dissapointment. Please wait until it goes on sale for less than $5. Save the money for gasoline!
4,Lloyd makes everything clear?,Lloyd's book solved SO many questions for me. The easy layout and straightforward advice helps me decide what to do with all that stuff in my closet! The beautiful illustrations make it coffee-table beautiful. Lloyd defines the difference between being trendy and being stylish (which lasts forever!).
2,Not Worth The Time,"If you're serious about Fashion, this book is not serious enough for you. The tips are nothing short of bland, and so simple. There is no real insight into style.Also, ""365 Daily Style Tips"" are more like ""Easy Outfits that Disregard personality and Body Shape"". This book was bland and a real waste of my time. All the book really emphasizes is Lloyd's face which appears before every month along with a his quote. Hello, if it's your book, you don't have to quote yourself.Basically, instead of walking away with 365 new tips, I walked away annoyed at Lloyd Boston.For serious Fashionistas, look past this book. If you're really interested in a 365 Fashion book, check out ""Frederic Fekkai: A Year of Style"" by Frederic Fekkai."
5,great gift!,"Someone gave me this book for my birthday and I thought it would be a nice ""prop"" for my coffee table or bookshelf. But it's amazing how many tips I actually use. I thought I already had good style! It's really a fun book with cute illustrations and interviews with top designers. I'm going to buy one to give to another friend."
1,I could poop a better book,"i mean what is he writing about? this book is not good for anyone to read, he has bad examples and my mom told me i would be better motivated if i read this, all it did was make me real sleepy. I'm getting sleepy just writing about this. read any other book. please. i'm getting sleepy."
1,This Book Is,Not very good. He analyzes things and applies them to other things that don't make any sense. My mom got me this book and said that it would help me with my schoolwork and that I could go to Europe with my friends if I read this book. The problem that it dosen't flow and I think Keith Elson should be doing something else like not writing any more of these types of boring books.
2,oh my goodness! yet another (bad) cd!,"I truly thought I was going to hear some funky tribal house music, instead I got yet another (bad)cd, with the exception of one song, BASS SECTION, WHICH IS TOTALLY OUT OF THIS WORLD! FANTASTIC! SO WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE OTHER SONGS?...THE LAST SONG IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THE CD...BASS SECTION GETS A 5 STAR! BUT THE OVERALL CD GETS A 2!"
5,Beautiful Flowers,"These flowers were such a great find. I have them placed in a white Lenox vase, and it sits in our living room. When turned on, they are a beautiful soft light in the room. Very romantic. When turned off, they are beautiful white roses sitting in a vase. I love them so much, I sent my mother one too!Thank you very much! Buy them, you'll love them!"
4,Not your father's mummies!,"I found this video very interesting. It covered not only the usual Egyptian mummies, but mummies in South America and Caucasian mummies in China. For only 51 minutes it provided a lot of information including modern mummification and DNA sampling of mummies. Brendan Fraser's voice over was adequate though sometimes it reminded me of a person speaking in hushed tones at a funeral. I had no trouble following what he was saying. I enjoyed this video which was much too short. As an overview, I highly recommend this video. It points out other areas to investigate such as the Chinchoro mummies and the Caucasian mummies of China. It was time pleasantly spent."
2,Hold on a second...,"This text, like most first edition books, contains numerous errors, defects in organization, and is in much need of revision. In addition, the index is grossly incomplete, making it difficult to find information. Some of the diagrams are helpful, however, they can, in their entirety, be found in other immunology texts, like the Lange Review Series Immuno/Micro text (0-8385-6287-6). Not the preferred introductory book for medical students, nor a bargain at ( )."
5,Immunology Book for Researchers and Physicians!,"In the increasingly integrative environment of the biological sciences, ""Clinical Immunology"" serves as a handy resource for researchers as well as physicians. It provides the novice with a clearly written elaboration of the language, the concepts and functions of the immune system. It is one of the most frequently used reference texts in my library."
5,COMPREHENSIVE TEXT IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY,The science of Immunology has become enormously complex in its detail. This book thus assists in the training of Clinical Immunologist's navigating them through the detail; the book provides clear explanations and works through problem situations with relevant case studies. The book is comprehensive and will be very useful also as a post graduation reference manual. I strongly recommend the book to all students of the subject.
4,great watch,Very high quality product. Extremely reliable and withstands all sorts of rough use. Also priced very reasonably. Would recommend this watch to others
3,Not a glowing recommendation to be Catholic,"Our woman's group of our Catholic Church decided to read this book, and while I couldn't attend their meetings, I did read the book. The ""50 Reasons I love Being Catholic"" didn't come off as proud as I am about being Catholic. The book was a let down. She didn't ""sing the praises"" of the various aspects; she just like of listed them. I really enjoy making the different Rosaries and saying the Rosaries, and she was ""flat"" on the subject. I've been waiting in Emergency rooms and saying the Rosaries and just holding them have given me such great strength and the Author just didn't reach that height of joy, the strength, the comfort, the peace, one gets from the Rosary. And the other topics were not brought up to it's appropriate height. I think the book has a nice listing of the various aspects, but that's it."
1,THE Cure for Insomnia!!!,"This book is required reading for State Farm employees (at least it was when I worked there!). I guarantee this book will put to sleep within five minutes of reading, regardless of your energy level. How bad is it? If you tear out the pages and use them as filters for your coffee maker, it will decaffeinate your coffee!Forget anesthesia, read The Farmer From Merna!"
1,Corporate Propaganda,"Do you really want to read a book about State Farm, written by State Farm? This book is handed out to all employees when they are hired, as part of the brainwashing process. The company was founded on a tradition of not bribing politicians and not influencing legislation. That doesn't apply anymore, as we're asked to call our legislators to support corporate legal initiatives.Don't get me wrong, 99% of companies do worse, giving money directly to candidates and lobbyists. But that's just a sad comment about the state of our current political and corporate environment."
1,"Junk, broke",Bought this as an upgrade to my oem battery terminals. This terminal broke when I attempted to tighten it. I returned it for a full refund.
2,db link btp2,"cheap allen bolt that shaves off metal when you tighten it, doesn't fit the posts well and the info said 1-0 ga connector with 1 4ga and 2 8 ga but it is a 2 ga NOT 0 gauge as advertised, waste of money same goes for the neg terminal"
2,No cover and whatever you do don't buy the matching (-) terminal!,This one went on ok but the negative terminal is too loose on the post even with the screw all the way in and torqued beyond belief. Their engineers obviously aren't being drug tested. Also the positive terminal has no insulating cover like many other brands do. Always a nice thing having all that exposed metal with a direct line to the positive side of your battery just sitting there waiting to weld itself to your hood or something.
5,Excellent handcuffs,I've used a set of these for years as a police officer. They fit MUCH better on folks with larger wrists yet can close tighter on smaller people. I've actually had prisoners comment on the cuffs being more comfortable than the standard type. The only problem is that these are harder to fit in smaller cuff cases or those made out of hard plastic. Flexible pouch type cuff cases hold these fine.
5,Intense,The connection I felt to the Earth as an animate being was intensified within the first ten pages of this book. I read another ten and logged back on to Amazon to buy this book for a friend who gardens. It is a simple spiritual journey home.
2,I have the old addition and its no improvement,"I have had this text for an intro to organic class this last semester, and using the old version for the class was easy since it hasnt changed in the new revsion. I hate to say it but it is well written except for the structure of the molecules since they are all in letter format, why couldnt they revise the new edition with line angle drawings the ink cost is the same.... it makes it that much harder to read with the current typewriter style samples"
2,WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS ABOUT TURKISH PUBLISHER,We have red this book both in Turkish and English we found out that the orginal of the book is perfect but on all of It's Turkish translations we are faceing lots of difficulties especially on figurs and formulas.That's because the printing quatity. Most of the figures and formulas are unreadable.We wish that the writers of the the book would tell the publisher(GUNES YAYINEVI LTD.) what they have to do in all ways.These unforgivenable problems couses deap damages on the books sciencetific value.If you would like to contact us for more information we would'd be happy to give any help you need. e-mail:dogankeskin@hotmail.com
5,I love it,I was very excited to receive this brush all my ferrets for there first year started getting hair balls and lax wasn't working all that good. As soon as I received my order I brushed all my ferrets and it 100% reduce hair balls. Ty seller my order was on time and very happy.
5,Ferret loves this brush,Wonderful product. My ferret enjoys getting pampered with this brush and this brush leaves her coat very manageable and soft.
1,"Hard bristles, seemed uncomfortable","This brush boasts soft bristles, but they're hard.My ferret looked like she was uncomfortable being brushed by it.I'm going to purchase a different brush."
3,Too tough,"It is a very difficult book, I think. It covers lots of topics, like Petrov Classification, Conformal Infinity, Kerr Metric, Null geodesic congruence and so forth, but it is fairly tough to read. I can only find very concise derivation in the book - that means I have to do lots of calculation on my own. When I read the algebraic characteristics of Eletromagnetic field, and null tetrad, the derivation is so hard for me ( I need to work whole morning to get through 4 pages) When I come to Petrov Classification, I cannot move any further. Although the book clearly shows you the motivation for some steps, but it omits too much mathematical details. I recommend Ray.d'Inverno's book or even more introductory like W. Rindler's book, which are much more friendly to readers than this one. To Stephani's, I can only address it as an inventory of useful conclusions.I am not sure anyone have good recommendation on Petrov classification which bothered me quite a lot..."
2,Mediocre,"Many important topics in this book are presentednot in a cutting edge manner and the stuff caneasily be found in all standard text;Newest topics in trauma like minimal invasivesurgery, computer aided surgery, new AO thinkingthat everyone doing trauma is talking about these daysnot covered or grossly inadequateI have 2 juniors who used to work with one of the authors,they told me there is a great discrepancy betweenwhat that author claims he would do in hislittle text, as compared to his actual practicein real life. I hope this is not the case, butif it is, readers will not be pleasedMediocre work at most"
3,For Ortho only,"I'm an Emergency Medicine resident, I felt that the vast majority of information in the book did not apply to EM residents. Too much info regarding grading of fractures and operative technique. Grazes over the topics needed for family medicine, urgeny care, emergency care (what needs admission, what needs emergency consultation, etc). Recommend this book for orthopedics, but not Emergency Medicine."
5,Best Concise Book for the Orthopaedists back pocket,"After wearing out my third edition, I decided to get the fourth. It is slightly wider, which makes it less easy to fit in the back pocket of scrubs, but it has more information on treatment modalities. I would recommend this for any resident."
4,Very decent...,"As it reads above, this is a very decent release by AL. It is, however, musically all over the place. Some songs are absolutely beatless, with speech samples and slow moving strings. Other songs are rather fast. It's rather like Orb's ""Adventures..."" cd in that respect, only not as mainstream.I like that however. The only thing that becomes difficult with cd's like this is the issue of where and when to play it. It is perfect to drift off to sleep to. However, if you wake easily, one of the faster songs will come on and wake you up. By the same token, it's not music that will lend itself readily to a party.I guess, if I had to, I would think it be a good early-morning chill-out cd. Great for the morning after kind of days. Much like some of the Cafe Del Mar or Chill-out Ibiza kind of cds.It's a very good cd...with fantastic music. Just be aware of the nature of it...."
4,Easy to install,These knobs are are much easier to install together than some others we've used in the past.
5,Great knob at a great price,"Very easy to install, only required one tool. The installation directions were terrible (contained pretty much pictures only), but it was easy to figure out just by looking at the pieces and how my existing knob was installed. Really spruced up my doors now that they don't have shiny brass knobs anymore, and the price was better than I found anywhere else."
3,"Nice Looking, Installation Not So Nice","Probably because of my existing door peculiarities, a couple of these knobs weren't quite as simple as pulling out the old and putting in the new. The inner part of the knob has a largish cylinder that really requires a 2"" hole. So, if someone drilled the hole in the door by hand without a hole saw, it may not be uniformly round.I wish I had spent a bit more to buy some that didn't show the screws."
5,Audio at its best,"Type 4 accoustics. (four speaker surround) for a quadriphonic recording that was faithfully transferred to digital disc. Much better than the Vinyl that dad used to have.It is a must for fans, or those experimenting with the genre."
5,The first and best by Mike Oldfield,"Whenever I hear music by Mike Oldfield, it is hard not to compare it with this album since it is the ultimate benchmark. The music is quite simply fantastic. Although the theme is repeated again and again it never becomes boring. On the contrary the music becomes ever more beautiful as you hear it again and again. A ""must buy"" if ever there was one!"
4,I've always liked this one.,I've read the panned reviews and laughed. It's an experimental album and it works. It's not life or death and can't really be compared to anything. It's like if one were to compare hard house techno to Stravinsky...I'm looking for complex counterpunctual change from the romance period and all I'm hearing is a bass drum repeating at 140 bpms...this sucks. If you don't like early mood setting music from acoustic instruments then you won't like this album. If you like soundscapes and are interested in thier origins then CHECK IT OUT! Simple. The first time I was introduced to this album it was though this drunk guy nicked named 'The Randomizer'. I popped it in and it was on the Klingon part. I never laughed so hard if my life. After a few days my couriosity got to me and I listened again. I liked it.
5,El antes y el despues de la musica,"No es el mejor disco de Mike Oldfield, pero si que es el disco que revoluciono el mundo de la musica. Sus casi 20 millones de copias vendidas hablan por si solas..."
1,"Some good raw ideas, but terrible arrangement.","There are several points where this music is actually good. Unfortunately, those peaks are surrounded by wide valleys of poor arrangement and overzealous mixes. Mike achieves many exciting ideas, but explores them only shallowly. Part II killed the listening experience for me. The rage-filled gutteral screaming is tasteless and out-of-place. If I can't return this CD, it will quickly become a coaster."
1,Listen before buying,"I bought this CD on the recommendations at sites like this but I found it to be be a very uneven collection of sounds and noises and musical interludes almost like a medley of tunes not strong enough to be songs in their own right, and with no real thread throughout. Having expected something a lot better and more musical than this I was extremely dissapointed. This CD for me heavily reinforced the rule I keep forgetting - Listen First!!"
2,not what I expected,"I was disappointed with this cd. The only section I had ever heard was the ""Exorcist"" music. The remaining content is not the same and falls far short. I was not able to find a ""listen to samples"" link for this cd. If I had, I would not have made this selection."
2,No imagination!,"Going through the reviews of Bells, I am particularly surpised by the irritation caused by the vocal bit on side two - The so called Klingon vocal. Well people, you simply have no imagination. I've always liked that bit. When it came, me and a friend of mine always had lots of fun, because we envisioned a little dwarf being chased by a pack of wolves. The little dwarf runs for his life, hindered by a full belly due to too much eating and drinking at a party the previous night. He has to puke constantly. Every now and then, he has to stop and lean against a tree to empty his stomach. That's where the SHLAUUUGHHH! noise comes from. meanwhile, you can hear the wolves, who are gaining on him, howl in the background.By the way, Bells doesn't interest me much. It's a mosaic of little ideas and not particularly interesting melodies. Doesn't take a genius to put together. But, granted, Oldfield would prove his uncommon craftmanship years later, with Incantations and Amarok."
1,Mike Oldfield's only,"achievement was his ability to play a couple of dozen different instruments, a one-man orchestra, which in itself is an accomplishment of the same magnitude as being a live mermaid in the P.T. Barnum circus. His masterpieces are monotonous, bleak and boring. The extravagant salesmanship of Richard Branson created a genius out of nothing. This could be the only explanation of the success of Tubular Bells. The introduction of exotic instruments (like two slightly distorted guitars) is the most brilliant idea ever and the 2 minutes of the Sailors Hornpipe theme attest to deep folk roots (and a monstrously tremendous intellect)."
1,this is me making a farting noise...,"like the other oldfield disk I recently purchased (based on 5-star reviews), I hated it. It's dumb, slow, rip-off rich, and mediocre synth music at best. I apologize to all you people who love it, but customers should not expect a full-on dance jam or anything intense or passionate, but rather, dreamy music that fails to inspire a feeling or anything but fart noises..sorry"
5,Still the album of the century,"Something on the radio froze me in my tracks one day in August '73 (I was 13 & learning guitar); I literally couldn't function till I found out what I heard...it was Tubular Bells! More than enough revievs have been done on this epic work;dawn of New Age, masterpiece,etc. Let me just contribute this as a musician; after 25 years I still get goosebumps from this and Oldfield's subsequent 3 releases...NOBODY played (or plays) guitar like that! This album will live on forever"
3,Titular swells,"Massively cited hodgepodge of prog-new-age-folk is not without its brilliant, albeit short-lived, passages, though I can't help but hear the majority as overly contrived."
3,Review of Tubular Bells,"This CD is pretty good, but i like the DVD with enhanced audio much better. Still, it's nice to listen to because it's Mike Oldfield, and he's awesome."
3,It saved my life,"None of my friends really like it, but i find this a very inspiring album if you're a musician yourself, and/or interested in recording, due to it's imperfections."
3,Excellent for it's time... but...,"After many listenings to this and (the Superior) ""Ommadawn"", I have reached the conclusion that Mike Oldfield (at least during this period of time) started running out of ideas after ""Side 1"" of each. The first part of Tubular Bells is stunning. The combination of instruments, the way it transforms from one theme to the next, etc... For the technology available at the time, it's amazing that it sounds as good as it does. Side 2, however goes quickly downhill... It really sounds like he was just trying to fill out the album... Mike might have meant to be having fun, but those voices totally ruin anything good that could have been. I still think this was (and is) an extremely important piece on music, I just think that maybe he should have put Tubular Bells Part 1 and Ommadawn Part 1 on the same album. Now that would have been 6 stars!"
3,Three stars for side one. Zero for side two.,"I challenge anyone to sit alone in your house, turn off the lights, and listen to the opening five minutes of Tubular Bells. If you survive that, then, uh, you're pretty brave. I've heard this was used as background music for an exhibit at the Boston Museum of Science. I can't imagine listening to this while pondering some rotating balls or something. I'd be looking over my shoulder, expecting to see some grinning weirdo ducking around a corner. Or maybe something CRAWLING around the corner. Never mind. Buy this one for the kaleidoscopic first half. I love the way Oldfield paints with his guitar, instead of strangling it in the usual rock fashion. The second half is the same broth, but with half the meat."
5,A pop-classical masterpiece...,"I first heard the 4-minute (Highly edited) cut of the beginning of ""Tubular Bells Part 1"" on the ""Pure Moods"" compilation. I later saw ""The Exorcist"" and found that the movie used the song as well. When I got the CD I didn't realize that the whole thing (parts 1 and 2) was almost 50 minutes long. And I LOVED it!!! This is one of the most eclectic musical masterpieces of all time. Covering the range from rock to classical to funk to ambient and back like a frantic marathon runner, this is a true original piece of music. Mike Oldfield has melded the genres of rock and classical unlike any other. Only the progressive greats like Yes, King Crimson, Emerson Lake & Palmer, and Pink Floyd have succeeded at such eccentricity and even then, this truly a different and original musical masterpiece! A classic!!!"
4,"The original, nothing more or less","I first heard this in its entirity via a scratchy record from a used record store. Scratches and all, I loved it (well most of it - I found the ""Piltdown Man"" annoying). Now I can hear everything clearly.Since I ordered the CD used, I'm not sure whither I got the ""remastered"" or simply ""transferred to CD"" version. My CD sounds like the record (without the scratches). There's no dramatic increase in dynamic range.It would have been nice to have separate tracks for each ""movement"", not just part 1 / part 2. It would be nice to, say, jump to the start of the ""introducing the instruments"" section (which has a definite beginning) and to skip the ""Piltdown man"" (which has a definite beginning and end)."
2,If you want good surround buy the 2003 re-recording!,"The two stars are for the recording not the music. This quadrophonic version of Tubular Bells is historically interesting but the sound is poor and tinny and the separation just demonstrates that although Mike was a multi-instrumentalist he wasn't a very good one! However, he rectified all of this when he re-recorded the entire thing for the Tubular Bells 2003 disc. That version has fantastic sound, better musicianship and the best immersive surround mix I've ever heard (and one sympathetic to the piece itself). If you want Tubular Bells in surround, skip this one and get the 2003 one. Even Mike Oldfield agrees its better!"
4,A 'must read' for Australian educators.,"This edited volume is in the 'must read' category for Australian educators. Powerful chapters by Headley Beare, Brian Caldwell and Geoff Romeo make the book a valuable addition to professional libraries. However, the book covers a wide range of of issues and there is something for everyone in it.July 1998"
1,Absolutely Terrible!,"... Not a ""soundtrack album"" at all, but merely excerpts from the actual film pulled off a videotape or TV broadcast. You hear dialogue, sound effects, and noise when a real album would feature music. Like all SOUNDTRACK FACTORY albums, this one is poorly packaged and an insult to the original creators."
5,The worlds absolutely best energized techno music ever!!!!!!,what more is there to say than this cd is the best energized techno music anyone will ever listen to.
4,All of a sudden he wants to wash his hands,"I purchased this dispenser for someone who was not so sanitizing. However, one day this person was visiting someone in the hospital and every time he would see this dispenser, he would use it. I was pleasantly surprised and even joked about it with him. Well, the person left the hospital but I did not want to leave this new side I was seeing so I ordered this product for his home.He LOVES it and cracked up when he opened it up. He now uses it all the time."
1,Terrible product,After the cartridge was put in the gel only come out occasionally. And it leaked and created a small puddle on the carpet floor. I hate to pull it out from the wall because it would leave a hole on the wall. I regret that I brought it.
1,Not very good as combination package,"The combination of dispenser and refill are not compatible. wrong refill bags and the supplier does not seem to understand the product and the specifications. Due to this mess, we have not been able to use. Do not use adhesive to stick to the wall as you can not remove it without damaging the wall. Just use simple screws."
5,Dispenser set,"This is a wonderful product. The installation was quick and pain free. I used a level, squared it off and just pushed it on the wall. As an added messure, Iinstalled 2 screws.It looks good and I am pleased with the ease of set up and that I was pumping product in minutes.Thanks for a great price and an outstanding product."
5,GREAT PRODUCT! SO EASY TO INSTALL!,"I bought this for our nursery at church. Everyone was so excited to see it--it's been a hit! It was installed in minutes, and the refill pouches were easy to insert. Worked immediately. Haven't had it long, so I can't say how it will stand the test of time."
2,Too Flimsy/Cheap to Use,"I should have known better from the price that these lacrosse sticks would be cheap. Even with the light weight of the ball, the sticks whip/bend when trying to throw the ball. If you kids are old enough to play with a lacrosse stick, then these are too flimsy for them. Definitely pay a little more for a real stick, not the cheap plastic."
5,great kids lacrosse set,My 8 year old son is having a great time learning lacrosse with this set we got him for his birthday.
5,Great for a kid!,"These FiddleSTX are perfect for a young kid! The ball is a little softer than the real thing for safety, but not so much that you can't play right. The nets are adjustable as well, so you can get a deeper pocket if you want."
1,toy sticks,"I did not know these were plastic toy sticks when purchased. The handles are flexible, easily breakable plastic. Returned them promptly."
2,fiddleSTX,Not what I was expecting. These are not very good quality. More like toys really. You get what you pay for. These were cheap. Enough said.
2,US Studio Does Nausicaa Terrible Injustice,"I saw 'Warriors of the Wind' and felt it was an amazing film. Then I saw the original, uncut 'Kaze no Tani no Naushika' and thought, my god - what had they done. This is a landmark film that cannot truely be appreciated in its edited version. New World Pictures felt it could only be marketed as a kid's action movie, so they cut out about a quarter of the movie (the parts they felt were ""slow moving"") and garbled the storyline in the process. [Writer/Director] Miyazaki was horrified when he found out what they had done to his film, and Ghibli [studios] asks everyone to forget that this version ever existed. Fortunately, New World Video's rights to Nausicaä expired in 1995. The distribution rights are now held by Disney, who did a nice job on 'Princes Mononoke'. One can only hope they will do as well with Nausicaä."
5,"Great, but pales towards Nausicaa","There are no doubts about it, Warriors of the Wind is an exception movie. But if you compare to it's original Japaneese version, Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa, Warriors just can't compete. Don't misunderstand this review, Warriors of the Wind is a great movie, it just is nowhere near as beautiful as the original. If one is to compare the two, Warriors is a ""one star movie."" But reviewed by itself, Warriors is a fantastic film which, if you're like me, will change the way you look at life. The only real problem with this film is it's availability. It is near impossbile to get a hold of this bad boy, but keep trying, you don't want to miss it!"
4,Another Eco Anime Flick,"The Japanese are obsessed with the destruction of the planet or so it would seem from many of their anime movies. In ""Warriors of the Wind"", we are in a post-apocalyptic Earth of the future. There's the ""Toxic Jungle"" were insects have grown to monstrous sizes, various wastelands, and the beautiful Valley of the Wind where the story starts.The story is pretty good (though I understand this VHS version has been seriously edited and a bunch has been cut from this release...typical movie industry actions back then because we Americans are to dumb to understand things). The animation is good and the voice-acting isn't bad. The only part I didn't like was the constant leftist preaching that goes on about the planet. It seems to come into play frequently which annoyed me a bit, but not enough to stop watching this movie nor to apprieciate it as a whole..."
3,Good story for all ages,"Sorry but all the critics slamming Warriors of the Wind are overly critical. Watch this cute animation until you get a chance to see the original Nausicaa. Nausicaa is great, but it doesn't justify measuring everything by it. My guess is most families may still prefer this version since it is less violent and sexual than many Anime movies. Rent it if you can still find it. This has become hard to find. I hope it comes out on DVDI think the nice thing about Warriors of the Wind was it didn't seem as serious and therefore can be enjoyed by a younger audience as well. Did it copy from other stories? Maybe, but then a number of movies have copied from somthing else. I don't recall seeing Nausicaa at my video store when I first rented this in the 80s so my family has enjoyed this movie for many years. I'm glad this movie doesn't have the adult relationships and bloody killings seen in many animated movies."
3,could be better,"Has trouble seeing temperatures on smaller objects (1/2"" pipe @ 120F as an example displayed 85F). Easy readings and accurate to calibrated thermometers on objects of 1"" or larger. Expected better for the price."
2,device was not manufactured properly to work,In original packaging by Hunter but controller on device was not manufactured properly to work. Speed control knob did not engage any of the settings.
1,Doesn't work properly.,"On my Hunter Original fan this controller has 3 speeds alright. Fast, sloooooow so slow you feel nothing, and a speed you can time with a minute hand. Avoid. About the same as a the wall switch I replaced."
4,Unlike anything I've ever read,"The idea of this book is brilliant. While it did lag in some parts, as a whole Echoes of Yesterday is beautifully written. It's so interesting to be inside the mind of a character who can't see; I haven't found another book like it."
2,Sorry Joe,"Joe, you seem like a nice and sincere guy, and I would like to have a beer with you sometime, but this book is very boring. In fact it is more interesting to read the programming section in my VCR manual."
3,The Holy Grail?...................no,"I enjoyed the book and the idea of it really got my wheels turning. The author lets you laugh along with him on this rather enjoyable mission to re-do some of his past. To me, it ended abruptly. Big build up and finish leaves you hanging."
3,I wouldn't give it another shot.,"Another Shot by Joe Kita, I listened to onthe way to my vacation. In this book, the author tries to relive, or correct his regrets.The book made me wonder about my own regrets. I dislike that word. Regret impliesthat I would change something in my past. Each thing that happened to me, eachdecision, lead me to the place I am now. I try to actively design my life and I amintensely happy and pleased with my life. So although I am sometimes curious about""what ifs"" in my life, I can't truly regret any decision, because any minor change mayhave altered my present.In spite of disagreeing with the author's premise, I still enjoyed parts of this book.The chapter about his mother is hilarious. Is it worth it to read the whole book? Idon't know. The book is written in a hokey way, which can be a bit cloying.http://home.att.net/~bunsonmars/"
3,No Tiene Brillo!!!,"Este disco no esta malo, pero no tiene brillo!!! No comparten el microfono con otras estrellas de el regaeton, nada mas que Baby Ranks y Divino en la mejor cancion de el disco, ""Salgo Filoteau,"" y Alexis y Fido en otras canciones. Los ritmos de las canciones no son muy buenas, y no suenan modernas, muchas de las canciones no son cantagiosas y las que la son no son muy buenas, como ""Raggae Rockeao,"" y el ridiculo ""Tarzan."" Este disco es un disco que pronto va hacer olvidado si ya no lo ha sido. Ojala que pegen mas duro con su nuevo disco, ""Pa'l Mundo."""
5,Book / Gift,This was a Birthday gift for 3 days after xmas.Arrived 2 days b4 her birthday.She loved it.Thank you.D.
1,Disappointed,I bought this book excited to read about knights and romance. I read only a few pages to know I had to stop. I did not like the Harlequin feel and the way Ryan was sweeping (literally) the heroine off her feet. I read a little and could not go on. Very disappointing. I've donated it.
2,Mastisol Liquid Adhesive,"Mastisol liquid adhesive did not work for me--I suspect my problem was just out of its range. I was looking for something to help hold ostomy wafers on the skin and it just did'nt hold. For more normal applications, it probably works fine--its reputation is good among medical professionals. It does not burn when applied to very tender areas and that may prove important to people seeking an adhesive to hold bandages in place."
1,Very Concerned Parent,"Please use extreme caution when using Mastisol. My daughter is in the hospital now recuperating from back surgery. The Anesthesiologist used Mastisol to secure the breathing tube during surgery. Immediately after surgery, her entire face began swelling, and is now two times it normal size, red, painful and itching. She is not recognizable. Even Benedryl has not stopped the progression. We are praying it will not affect her breathing.I also urge the FDA to test this product further(along with Benzoin), and, before use, require at least a skin test."
5,Check for Allergy -- Not for Ostomies!!!,"REGARDING MASTISOL AND ALLERGIES AND OSTOMIES: As a home health nurse, I use Mastisol on a near-daily basis to secure dressings and protect skin. A few people ARE allergic to it, as with any foreign substance on the skin. These allergic reactions can be extreme and immediate or delayed sensitivity and minor. People who are allergic to many substances, especially plant substances or ASPIRIN should not use Mastisol. Lastly, regarding OSTOMIES, the wafer is designed to be applied to clean and dry skin. Typically after washing and drying well, apply the wafer directly to the skin. Avoid glues (Mastisol), gels, and even barrier pads, which leave a slight film that often degrades after 2-3 days, which is a shorter-than-desired duration for an ostomy wafer. Sometimes, a small amount of ostomy paste will help fill a crevasse, wrinkle, or small wound, but avoid paste for best results! Mastisol--GREAT STUFF--but not for ostomies or allergic individuals! :)"
4,Product as described,This product is a much less expensive way to purchase. The individual containers are a lot nicer but are ridiculously expensive.
3,"OK, but consider buying at a bricks/mortar store","This bike was purchased for my four year old daughter. She was thrilled with the colors. The bike is a strudy build and a nice design. I imagine she will outgrow it before we have any issues from wear and tear. The packing for shipping did not hold up particularly well and the bike suffered some superficial scratches and a busted reflector as a result. I discovered this two days before giving the bike to her and replaced the damaged part from a local bike store. As several reviewers noted, the instructions that came with the bike were generic and borderline worthless. Nonetheless, I figured it out (which is saying a lot since I am personally worthless when it comes to putting together kids toys). I am not unhappy with the purchase and my daughter loves the bike, but even for someone who buys everything online, I will probably buy my next bike at the local bike or a Toys R Us store to avoid the issues with shipping and assembly."
3,girls bike training wheels,"The bicycle was delivered very quickly after ordering it. It's a sweet-looking bicycle and my 5 year old loved the look of it. It does look absolutely perfect for a little girl. It seemed to weigh a ton so she had trouble pedalling. She's a strong, sporty girl but so even an adult or bigger child had to push her a lot of the time. The bicycle itself was too heavy to pedal for a long time. We were on flat ground not a hilly area."
4,great little girl bike,"This bike is great for my little girl. She is four years old and she rides it everyday some times for and hour. she will be able to use it for years to come. The only complaints i have are the directions were useless and, when the box was delivred the box was ripped in a few places and the bike had about 8 or 9 big chips on it. So i was very unhappy with amazon.com with the way it was damaged. The last thing a little girl wants on her brithday is a pink bike with chips all over it."
3,Cheryl,"I teach Data Structures. I like this book because it covers a lot of material in an easy to understand way. There are several areas that need to be improved:*The exercises are awful. I like to assign homework problems from the book, but I can't if I use this book.*The material on stacks, queues, and lists is in a weird order. Some Linked List concepts are given in Chapter 4, then revisited in Chapter 6. By the time you get to Chapter 6, it seems like most of the Linked List concepts have already had to have been covered to get through Chapters 4 and 5. And the array and linked implementations are all mixed together."
1,Don't use this book to teach your CS class,"Regrettably I selected this book for my class. At first look, I thought it was concise and I liked that it seemed to get right down to details. But three weeks in, I groan every time I sit down to read a chapter ahead of my students. The example code was very clearly written in a word processor and never once ever compiled. The examples are riddled with code that doesn't compile. On page 74, there is a for loop using commas instead of semicolons. On page 75, they use the keyword ""not"" instead of a bang. That's how often errors occur. Think how many hours my students will waste as they can't figure out why examples from the book just don't work on their own computers. The appendix of java specifics is very incomplete and contains errors. The book even has a plot of the growth of functions (page 19) and the authors placed log n above n. The problems go on and on. What a piece of garbage."
5,"Gooooood Book, but old version !","I think it is ok to use old version for me, but if you need new version, you had better choose another edition!"
2,Lots of errors.,"The code in this book is often wrong, which is very difficult for beginners to figure out. Concepts are explained well, though hashing is not as emphasized as it should be, and leans towards the end of the book, which in a college setting, could easily confuse many students. There also isn't as much as an emphasis on testing code and creating reliable software for all the discussions on why to make reliable software. The concepts also jump around a lot more than is good. However, the metaphors are very good and the overall text is decent."
1,TERRIBLE,"This is the worst text I have ever had to use. There is no cohesion - Chapter one, for example, provides not enough information on too many topics - and I suspect some of the exercises are erroneous. Either that, or they just don't supply you with enough information to answer their own questions. It is not easily understood either; they do not provide the reader with sufficient examples to illustrate their meanings."
2,Some useful stuff,"This book has a couple decent chapters. However, overall, I didn't find the book to be nearly as enjoyable or as informative as the Java Software Solutions (also co-authored by John Lewis). Somehow the material is just not presented in a very engaging way. Unless you are really into programming or Java, I would recommend only purchasing the Java Software Solutions."
5,ROMANCE OF JIM BRICKMAN,"This versatile performer with the keyboard is always a welcome breath of fresh style with every album. He can stir emotions with slow ballads, but also get your pulse moving with upbeat selections just as easily. I never tire of his ability."
4,Good taste and cleans up well,"Didn't include recipes, but I found tons online. I haven't mastered putting jelly inside yet. So, it's awesome that this pan cleans up so well. Don't add too much oil to each cup - it doesn't take much."
2,Tiresome,"I love her previous CD ""Careless Love"" and bought this one on faith. Mistake!On this CD she shows the unerring ability to turn any song into a dirge. I've played it multiple times now hoping that my disinterest was mood based, but no, this CD fades into the background never to emerge. On ""Careless Love"" I thought her phrasing added interest, on this CD I find it gimicky and ultimately annoying. When every phrase ends with the fall off, it loses interest fast. I'm not convinced, but if it is an attempt to imitate Billie Holiday, enough is enough.Or it just might be the songs: only ""Blue Alert"" and the title track have me returning for more. The rest is just aural wallpaper or worse; as with the soporific ""Everybody's Talking At Me"".Sadly, I need to be more circumspect with Ms. Peyroux, previews will be required for future purchases."
2,"""She's her own, very real thing."" Uh, not quite......","The main editorial review at the top of this page concludes by saying, ""She's her own, very real thing."" Someone could write this only if they've never heard Billie Holiday. And if they've never heard Billie Holiday, they have no business writing editorial reviews for Amazon.Peyroux is to Billie Holiday what Harry Connick, Jr. is to Frank Sinatra. Suit yourself, it's your money."
3,Over-rated,I'm unimpressed. I had originally heard the title track and thought the entire CD would be as good. It's not. I wasn't at all impressed with some of the other classic re-workings.
5,Quirky voice makes me smile,"I had heard Madeleine Peyroux's voice very briefly several months ago, and it really made me perk up my ears. I HAD to find out who that was! I was really tickled when I found her album when wandering around Amazon, and have been really pleased with it. She has a really great quirky voice and a comforting rhythm that send me way back to - I don't know - the forties, maybe? Peyroux isn't pop - not enough people will get it - but I know I'll watch avidly for new albums from her."
1,Less than half,"Like many, I was really looking forward to Peyroux's followup up to ""Careless Love."" This new album was definitely not worth the wait. The choice of songs, the styling, the engineering and pretty much everything else here disappoints. Hate waiting, but I hope she'll take a break and give the next effort more time and thought."
1,An artist who recylces more than aluminum!,"Do you love ripoff artists such as Lenny Kravitz and Norah Jones? Does true originality disturb you and drive you to seek cover in the soft womb of corporate created fluff marketed as the real deal? Then you're in for a treat with this album! Not even Rich Little could do Billie better. Texture of voice AND delivery expertly stolen without a qualm, but without any of the icky sincerity and authentic pain of the original. Enjoy!"
3,The other half is asleep,"This is a qualitatively nice CD, but all of the songs are sung with the same tempo, sound level, and stylizing. the result is a CD guaranteed to put you to sleep and not really long for the initmacy of the song. Ms. Peyroux is a curious blend of a Black torch song singer from a long long time ago---get the picture? Almost like she prefers to mimic. Perhaps she's an acquired taste--I don't know--I'm not hungry anymore."
5,another gem,"Madeleine Peyroux has a sensuous voice with hints of Billie Holliday. The sirens who lured sailors from the wine dark seas may have sounded like this. She takes old standards like The Summer Wind and familiar pop tunes and makes makes them sound like they were written just for her. This collection is more mellow and relaxed than Carefree Love. I could listen to it every day. I would, however, like to see her next effort edgier, like an intimate concert in which she can respond to the audience."
1,So disappointing.,"Ever since I discovered Careless Love, I've been waiting for Madeleine's next album with a lot excitement. Well, here it is. And what a disappointment. I've been listening to it over and over and can't seem to find the vitality she had in her last album. The music is dull and the lyrics are cheesy, but if your just looking for some good background music for a romantic diner, it'll do just fine."
3,"Same old, same old",Miss Peyroux reminds me a lot of Billie Holiday. She has an exceptional and beautiful singing voice. Her rendition of standards in this album is great. She should just record a real jazz album full of the great american songbook.I am a big fan of her but I am still waiting for album of just standards.
2,An unfortunate new direction,"After a stunning first couple of albums, this folksy, low-key CD is a letdown. Where is that haunting voice that sounded like Billie Holliday reincarnated?Come back to jazz, Madeline!"
4,A Serene State of Mind,"There are those who'll dismiss Madeleine Peyroux as just another Billie Holliday wannabe - and those are the people who just don't 'get' what a wonderful artist Madeleine Peyroux really is. Madeleine is unique and cannot be pigeon-holed into one genre, or another. She is what she is: one of the best song interpreters we have today. Her vocals carry you to a serene state of mind. Stand out tracks include ""Everybody's Talkin'"" ""Once In a While"" and ""Half the Perfect World,"" but the real stunner here is the introspective duet by Madeleine and K.D.Lang on Joni Mitchell's ""River."""
4,Madeleine Peyroux - Half the Perfect World,Very soulful artistry and a wide range in style made this cd very enjoyable. Peyroux's voice is very remeniscent of Billie Holiday and it has an undercurrent of angst. I would have liked a bit more up-tempo tunes but overall a very pleasant listening experience that I do not tire of.
5,Best yet,This is a great album. First note to last. You'll put it on repeat and leave it on all day.
2,A Disappoinment,"After Careless Love, this was a major disappointment. It's difficult to decide if it is the song selection or the audio that makes this release so unsatisfying. Ms. Peyroux sounds like someone forgot to turn her mic on."
4,Very Good~ Not as good as her last CD!,Madeleine Peyroux is a amazing singer and this is a good CD but not as good as her last.
3,Fine Voice - Not Thrilled About the Songs or Arrangements,"I can totally understand why many people like this artist. She has a fine voice (which sometimes DOES sound much like Billie Holiday). On this particular cd, I do not like some of the song selections (The Summer Wind for one), or some of the light-weightedness of the arrangements (why put the riff for Jingle Bells into Joni Mitchell's song 'The River?)."
2,not really distinctive,"It's a sad thing when the most engaging music on a vocal album comes from the backup musicians. I had heard parts of this singer's first CD and enjoyed it quite a bit. Ms. Peyroux seemed to have a sense of style -- even if most of it was borrowed from you-know-who -- and a retro taste that made her stand out from the current crowd.But I have been unable to listen to this entire CD in one sitting. In fact I haven't gotten more than three tracks into it without giving up in boredom. The pianist was doing more interesting things than the woman he accompanied.Unbelievably lackluster performances. And not very well mixed or balanced either, although at least one can say the production is consistent with the flavorless artistry on ""display"" here.Anyone who experiences M. Peyroux for the first time via this album will probably wonder what all the fuss is about. Sorry to be so negative. Even sorrier I spent money on this."
1,There Is only So Much I Can Take,"This album is less than nothing.I would usually not write bad things about stuff I don't even listen to,but this album has crossed the line.Nothing but screaming and loud instruments."
1,A Modem To Avoid!,"I've had 3 of these atrocious modems foisted on me by Dell.I don't ask for a lot from a modem. It needs to not breakdown, and to be able to handle somewhat noisy lines withoutlosing too much throughput. The CBM56WBG fails in both regards.The longest I've had one work was 3 months. They've failed forvarious reasons, so I have to believe there is a real qualityissue here with Xircom.Even a small amount of noise will really crimp your downloadswith this modem. It seems to be really intolerant of linenoise. I can rarely connect at any speed highly than 45.3Kbps,and my effective throughput is usually 60% or less of that. Sincewe live like gypsies, I've been able to test this modem froma number of locations, both urban and rural, and the resultis similar in all cases.Finally, you get a XJack connector with this modem. Beprepared for inadvertent log-offs as you adjust the positionof the laptop and the cable disconnects."
5,Dreams and the Subconscious Mind,Greatest Dream Book ever written - Lots of people are looking for it so Barnes & Noble needs to reprint this one soon.
3,ehh,"zebulon is definitely a great band for the stoner rock genre, but i still much prefer swallow the snake from their desultory days. that was one of my all time favorite albums. this one? well, if you are a fan of stoner rock, this is an absolute must."
5,brilliant,"Originally bought for the Errol Dunkley's ""Black Cinderella,"" which is still my favorite, but only by a nose: every track on this CD is tight! Standouts are ""Hell and Sorrow,"" with Hortense Ellis' wailing vocals, the rocksteady trombone of ""Zionyouth,"" and ""Cinderella in Black,"" Augustus Pablo's instrumental version of ""Black Cinderella."" Of course the sound is a bit muddy (this is 1960s Jamaica), but a low price to pay for great music from the early days of reggae."
2,Sizing is not correct.,"Material is good but they run too small (and since it is underware, once the package is open, they can not be returned. This is not Amazon's fault directly. It is Fruit of the Loom. I bought some Hanes for the same price and the sizing was fine. I will never buy Fruit of the Loom again."
2,Sizing is not standard,"I normally wear mediums, 32 in waist. Even other Fruit of the Loom products mediums always fit just fine. So I ordered a medium and they were too big."
4,Good Fit,They fit in all the right places and they don't get twisted around and strangle me...Love 'em...Sorry no photos available---
4,Great wear!,Excelenst product. I only wish they came in black. I think one should be able to buy just one color. Thanks.
4,Pretty good for workout at the gym,I am used to loose boxer shorts and feel that the medium size is a little tight for me (32 inch waist on a 6 foot). But they are pretty good for workout at the gym. I like them.
4,Comfortable but could be a little longer.,"I am very satisfied with the quality and comfort of these briefs. However, the legs are not as long as in the picture."
3,"You get what you pay for. Not bad, not great.","Its made out of really thin material. Its comfortable, however they are a little smaller than some of the other brands out there so I would order one size up than what you would usually do."
3,Better than Standard Bulk Boxers,"As far as bulk boxers go, these are the ones to go with. They fit snug in the right places and leave room where room needs to be. My favorite ""boxer"" by far is CK Micro Model, but those are expensive and not something I wear for every day juggling routines. These however are great for workouts and day-to-day wear.UPDATE: The light blue is a horrible color, the darks look better. They have gotten quite a bit faded in 6 months of use, but that doesn't really bother me. They are also a bit saggy, but I guess I could be losing weight. The point I'm trying to make here is that I am incredibly good looking."
5,Easy & Comfortable,Most times you guess what's there to write about a pair of under pants? But with these there is. The briefs are soft to skin. And have a long and well curved opening for you to reach for your fly when you zip down. The best and most comfortable for me so far. I hope they're as durable too.
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros: The fabric is very soft and feels good against the skin. The waist band isn't to tight, it fits good against the waist.Cons: There a bit bigger than the size you order, I ordered a Small and they when you try them on they look and feel Medium. There more boxer then brief. There a bit longer than what I expected."
2,Boxer short underwear,I thought I was ordering traditional boxer short underwear. But these underwear bottoms are much tighter than the boxer shorts I'm used to.
1,Bad for self image.,"Accentuate gut and love handles. Make me look worse than any brand or style I have ever worn. Impossible for me to look any worse in underwear (I have a 30 inch waist and well defined abs). If you are not an NCAA swimmer, you will probably not look good in these. I tried on one pair, and will give the rest to Good Will. Hanes work better for my body."
4,nice briefs,"nice quality, good look, okay fit. but for best fit and max comfort regular briefs [e.g.Haines or Fruit of the Loom] are 5 star. can't say I wouldn't buy again; so difference isn't great. maybe it's my particular shape."
1,too thick and bulcky,"The boxer briefs are fitting well, but are mede of a very thick and bulcky fabrick"
2,No chemistry with this NEW BASSIST!,"The original bassist of this band is what made it so great. A LONG WINTER has no chemistry without him. A LONG WINTER sounds so cookie-cutter now. The BREATHING UNDERWATER EP was such INCREDIBLY intense stuff, but it's a shame that no-one will hear it. PORTRAITS HUNG IN EMPTY HALLS, the 2nd track of the EP was sung by my friend Carl C., and his bass playing had such great atmosphere.The new black bassist just does the cliche' cook-cutter POISON THE WELL approach."
1,Save your money,"This is my 80 year old mother's favorite fragrance, and I bought this for her, as hers had ""turned"" and most of our local stores don't stock it anymore, or only stock a huge bottle of it that she will never use. So, this size looked perfect for her, and, of course, the price was right. My fear was that at such a steep discount, it was probably old stock and no longer smelled right, but I decided to take a chance. Of course I was right--the color has darkened considerably in the bottle and it too has ""turned"". So, save your money and buy a bottle at a department store (if you can find one that has it) so you can smell it before you buy."
3,no index,"I would rate this book a 4.5 or 5 IF it had an index. Unbelievably, it doesn't. I think that's inexcusable in a book that often is needed in an emergency, when seconds count. And this is a 2nd edition, too."
4,too much,"If Nolee suddenly breaks out it's probably because she has so much makeup on.. What is it with her and the color purple, anyway? The outfit and the accessories are cool. Hey, do you think we will ever see the my scene girls' parents?"
1,Mattel is really cheap,Hmmmm lets start from the beggining oh yes Mattel you Copy MGA Entertainment big time!!! I am a huge fan of the Bratz and i am angry cause of those cheap losers whom copy big time!! This year everything on my wishlist is Bratz no Mattel at all!!!!Mattel copy the big lips from the Bratz. Except the big lips dont look good on the My Scene so they look cheap and ugly!!And Nolee hmmmm i have never seen a doll so ugly and cheap hmmmm i think i'll stick to the Bratz..Ask anyone Bratz was out before My Scene or Flavas or any Mattel dolls except Barbie so there!! And the My Scene party pad is cheap and unstable but the Bratz pad is good quality but more cash but i'd rather pay more for something better....and oh yes...MY SCENE (...)!!! BRATZ ROCK THE WORLD!!!!!!Alanni
1,O_o_O holly god!!!,What is this!??? It looks like she's been dipped in a huge pot of make-up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Holly bratz don't even look this bad and i like bratz better my scene sucks!! hahaha!!blahblah i know what my scene fans are gonna think but i have to say what i think!
1,Copycat....,"I cannot tell you how cheap this toy is! The shirt is exactly like one of the Bratz, just check it out- It's in the fashion pack called Secret Crush. Bratz came out before My Scene; they just sell them cheaper so more kids will buy them!"
4,"Good pot, lovely design","I love the design of this pot and use it often for all kinds of different things: boiling pasta, simmering sauces, soups, and stews. My only complaint is that it is easy to scald oneself while stirring or, for example, draining pasta b/c the mouth of the pot is a little narrow. I have learnt to kind of stir and drain pasta from an angle instead of straight on. It is a sturdy and well-made pot with with an excellent steamer basket; it's very easy to steam broccoli while boiling pasta. My only complaint is that I wish the mouths of the pot and steamer were the same width and that the lid fit both of them more tightly. Good pot, though."
2,NIgella pot,"Pot arrived and it looks a little cheap. There is pitting inside the pot we have.Having said that it works well and doeas it's job.I still could not see Nigella buying this particulare pot, and woudl expect to py half the price if it didn't have a brand name attached to it."
2,Yet another case of cops-vs-serial killer,"The Mayor of L.A. assigns Robert Stack to head a team to catch a nun-killer but since the killer's identity is known to the audience from the very beginning, there's not much suspense here, and even a pro like director Walter Grauman can't overcome the script's distasteful quality. A young Tom Selleck plays a cop but he's not allowed to fully display his talents. (In other words, he keeps his clothes on.)"
3,Good price but little else,"Despite the bargain price, this recording can't be recommended to Scelsi fans. The performance of ""Quattro Pezzi"" is not as good as the one directed by Wyttenbach on Accord. And the pieces composed by Zender are not particularly distinguished."
4,satisfied with purchase,I am a previous owner of a royce union mountain bike. The bike I purchased is a very good deal for the money.A very good low end mountain bike for the money.
3,blue agate band,"My husband couldn't believe this was agate, and I have to admit, I find it hard to believe. It's very light, but exactly what you would expect from the picture.I bought a bunch of these in different colors. I like 'em!"
2,Agate Band Gemstone,"The customer service for this product was faultless. It arrived quickly and was well-packaged. The product, however, was a disappointment. Instead of being blue, as it was advertised, it is, in fact, nearly transparent with a pink tinge."
5,Just what my tree needs each year!,"My pin oak tree started to get yellow each year, so did my neighbors. I started using these each spring before the leaves come. They first year I could see that my tree was green and the neighbors was yellow. I told him what I had used, but he didn't listen. Four years later.... his tree was cut down because most of it was dead and mine is healthier then ever. I'm a believer!"
4,Really good for the price,Not being an experienced archer I did have some mishaps with applying my nocks. Keep in mind how the nock should be placed on the string prior to clamping it down. The pliers did their job but were at times somewhat awkward to use. All in all I guess if I knew what I was doing it would have been easier.
4,They work,"I would like to see them open more, however they work for what they are supposed to do so that is well."
3,its built ok and it semi works,It is not for knocking any strings for compound bows though. Every time I tried it would bend the knock instead of curving it. I was at one point almost cutting into my string. I tried several different companies that make knock points but to no joy. I did pick up a much better one at my local shooting range. I suggest you find the knocking multipliers.This one did however put a nice knock on my friends recurve. Go figure
2,Noking Pliers 50% Useless,"All items were as described BUT ONE ITEM. The 'Allen Company Nocking Pliers. They worked great to crimp nok on, but 'TOTALLY USELESS' FOR REMOVING NOK! --NOT AS DESCRIBED!I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone else, :(My mistake, I thought the removal info was in the ad. It was mentioned in the package info.It said that it had an angle on the tips to remove the nok...but I don't see any angle and it crushed 2 noks onto the string. I had to cut them very carefully with my Dremel.I'll keep the pliers for crimping noks on and use my Dremel to remove them. It takes too much time and hassel to return etc. --I'll just accept this method and be done with it."
3,"Cable ""connectors"" do not work","The three stars are for the rock lights themselves. It lights our waterfall beautifully over our pool. But, my husband was able to successfully manually connect the lights to the cable without the connectors which are designed to ""clamp down"" over the cable to automatically connect each rock light to the cable. The cable is too thick for the connector to clamp down through the cable. He had to hard wire each light to the cable manually. They work now, but is a poor design."
2,Dire Crossing - I was disappointed,"I was very excited to find out about this book as it combined many of my interests - a mystery about ice skating, set in Casa de Campo golf resort in the Dominican Republic, where I had stayed and played. It was an interesting plot idea and the plot itself was ok but the writing was much too simplistic. She very frequently put words in quotes to ""emphasize"" them, and it drove me crazy. Although it seemed that she tried, there was little depth to the characters - the main female character kept saying things like ""oh, I love my husband so much,"" - an attraction between her and the skating manager was an attempt at some emotional complexity, but it did not work.I enjoyed the familiarity with the setting and the skating connection (although there really is nothing about skating except setting up the travelling show). But I would not recommend this book to those who are looking for high quality writing."
4,Worth getting,"Easy to read format. Julian is allowed to speak for herself without the editoralizing some other collections of her work contain. 4 stars instead of 5 only because, and this is nothing more than a personal preference, I prefer less of a translation from Julian's Middle English.This is the second book by Julian I've purchased.The Gift Of Julian Of Norwich by Karen Manton and Lynne Muir has stunning illustrations and is perhaps worth the price just for those but contains more comments by Karen Manton than verses by Julian. It also gives the Middle English with modern translation. I wish the illustrator, Lynne Muir, had collaborated with the editor of this volume. Sure the artwork would have doubled the price of this book but I would be glad to pay it."
5,Great Gammas are GREAT!,"I started with the subdude, gamma, mopad: and now I have all gear, including the rack, on Great Gammas. What an amazing change these made in my listening environment. Unwanted bass harmonics and resonance are gone, the mid-range has cleared up, and even with mid-range receiver (due for replacement) is producing sizzles, tophats, and triangles as never before heard from this unit. I use a space between two Great Gammas for routing the power cables, and subdudes over the crack to prevent the signal cables from getting close. A space between the Great Gammas and the wall provides a conduit for the power cords.I live in an apartment with carpet over concrete floors (note those of you with sound rooms in basements). I had no idea how much sound wave energy was being communicated through those floors and producing standing waves.Very highly recommended and likely would improve any system for a pittance of upgraded equipment, speakers, or cables,"
4,"It works, but probably not as well as you're expecting","Don't get me wrong: I'm glad I bought it, and it works. However I live in a town home where we share walls on each side, and I had to put my guitar amp on this and another layer of acoustical foam to sufficiently attenuate the bass from traveling into the structure. I would imagine that this would work best with a smaller amp (I have a Marshall JVM and 1960 cab) on a rigid surface, such as concrete."
4,Great Purchase!,We got this bike for our son's 3rd birthday. It was very easy to assemble and is quite sturdy. He is tall for his age so we wanted a bike that would last him for a while but also be something he could ride right now. At the lowest seat position his feet just touch the pedals and he wasn't used to coaster brakes but with just a little practice he is able to cruise around on it without problem. We are very pleased with our purchase.
4,Nice ride,"We purchased this bike for my 4 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He loves it. Overall it's a really solid bike and it was easy to assemble. It is a bit a the heavy side, but not so much that he can't handle it though. My only complaint is the handbrake which seems more for show than actually stopping the bike (it has coaster brakes too). They don't quite function right."
3,Soyinka's a master,"I have read four of Soyinka's plays and found his use of language and drama to be exciting and unmatched by any other African playwright. The Brother Jero plays portray the problem of many African societies which have fallen to religion as a way out of their problems, only to be exploited by dubious and unscrupulous 'prophets' who know their weakness. Soyinka artistically avoids the criminalisation of Bro Jeroboam -he dupes even the authorities. The farce is that this silly problem continues unchecked in many places, despite the obvious bad character traits of some so-called prophets. A treat for lovers of subtle comedy."
4,A quick read witha lot of information.,"This book is a very quick read and is set up exactly as the title says. It's 201, numbered paragraphs, each with a little insight into how to deal with ""those people."" The sections are informative and helpful. I would definitely recommend reading this book before trying to get transferred away from the difficult person in your life."
3,A Place to Start,"A little book with exactly 201 short paragraphs. The paragraphs are gathered into topics such as Bosses from Hell, Passive Aggressive People, and Beating Up the Bully.This book is not enough to learn anything substantial about how to deal with difficult people. It is just enough to stimulate the reader's appetite for something more extensive. Julie Ann Wambach, author ofBattles between Somebodies and Nobodies: Combat Abuse of Rank at Work and at Home"
3,Not what managers need,"This book is ok for learning how to deal with others, but if you are a mgr. looking for help in working with subordinates, this is not the best."
4,Little box of fun,"I like this little magnetic Haiku set. It is handy enough to tote right along with you.I do not use mine on the fridge.I spread the words out, and form poems right on the counter.Afterwards, I write the poem in my poetry journal.I have only one complaint.Although the box is lovely in its decor,I so wish this came in a metal box. Far easier to toss in your purse....no crushing.However, that said,I so like this item!"
4,Fun times,These magnets are great for relieving boredom and having some inspiring artistic moments in the process.
1,"Don't buy this item, unless you want a neon green product","This product is not as pictured. It is actually a neon green - almost glow-in-the dark looking. I contacted the seller, expecting them to explain that they had shipped the wrong item. Instead they told me that it must be my computer screen darkness. I have looked at this item on multiple computers and it is my belief that this product is being misrepresented."
3,What relationship??,"I'm sorry but this book confused me. These 2 people never said or acted liked they wanted to be together, in fact, the male lead fought it every step of the way. Yet, they were constantly doing things as a couple---dancing, cuddling, touching etc while he kept insisting there was nothing between them. It made no sense. As for the mystery, it was almost an afterthought at times, but I will admit it took me a while to figure out whodunit. It's not a bad read, but I've certainly read better."
4,Good book,"I enjoyed this book more than I expected. It started slowly, but got better the more I read. Good easy read"
3,Not that great,"For a mystery, this book wasn't that great. It focused more on the romance, which in my opinion was lacking, than the mystery. There was no suspence. Not very much chemistry between the characters. And in the end the killer made no sence. I don't think I'll be buying another on of her books."
2,Disappointing story development and ending,"When I started reading this book, I found it fairly entertaining. However, as the story progressed, it seemed like the author had trouble developing the characters and the mystery. The main character's behavior was erratic and the romance seemed bland. The mystery never developed into anything very suspenseful. In the end, the author didn't bother explaining much to the reader about the murders and the reasons behind them, almost has if the author didn't have good explanations herself. Even if this novel is free, it's not worth wasting your time on it considering the disappointing ending."
4,Good Romance with Mystery for Seasoning,"I choose this book for a lighter mystery/suspense read for a change, and it proved to be just what I was looking for. The love story was rather predictable, as most are, but the mystery element was still there. If you want an enjoyable read that you look forward to getting back to in your spare time, this is the book for you. Even though it takes place in rural small towns and contains 'ranch life' you're not overwhelmed with horses and ranch life, just enough for flavor. I look forward to reading another book by Ms. Aris Whittier."
4,Great complex harmonics,"This ride has excellent stick definition and a very complimentary wash. The bell is small, but sounds nice. The overall character of the ride is hard to describe, but it works at all volumes. I like this much better than the HHX Dry (too clangy)."
4,A snippet of history,"This is a fascinating insight into what physicists were thinking at the time of building the bomb, together with a sometimes amusing retrospective by Robert Serber. Although it is technical in places the lectures were originally simplified to present the essential physics, which is perfectly accessible to any high-school graduate.The Frisch-Peierls memorandum is a nice touch; after reading Serber's lectures it gives and idea of what others were thinking and where the major uncertainties lay.The electronic version of the book loses a star due to the execrable editing; despite the steep price the publishers evidently decided none was necessary. The display equations are simply copy and paste images interspersed with improperly typeset inline math littered with errors. The original lecture extracts and Serber's commentary are in the same font and it's not always easy to tell which is which. A shoddy job, UCP."
3,Heathen straightedege.,"Maybe it's hardcore that's influenced by metal.Maybe it's metal, cleverly disguised as hardcore.Maybe it's metalcore.It's definitely a heavy dose of heathen, straightedge, tough mosh in the vein of Hatebreed, only a bit slower overall. Double-bass drumming abounds, as do plenty of opportunities to get on your floorpunching and your picking up change. As with most mosh or hardcore records, the record does not have anything on the live show, but it can be a good tool for learning the words and helping you warm up your pointer finger."
4,A cracking start to a musical career.,"Having got all of her later work, this one, her first, sounds a little timid and rough round the edges but other than that time has been good to it. Throughout there is a strong element of integrity and musicality sadly missing in a lot of performances by other artists. I return to this album from time to time and it is always a pleasure.To hear just how good Julia's voice is listen to ""Invisible War"" a couple of times. This is a very strong track that shows Julia's confidence in her voice and how it can be laid bare for maximum effect.If you like this one you will like the rest. My personal favorite is her 4th album, ""Falling Forward"", a significant leap forward in her work marking her move much more towards an American sound with input from the illustrious Larry Klein known for his work with Joni Mitchell.In summary this is a good place to start listening to Julia."
4,Love her but I'm biased...,"I heard her first single (off of this album) on either VH1 or MTV back in college. Her albums have that mix of ""good the first time you hear it"" and ""I hope I grow to like this"" that will keep the singles to a minimum. THIS album, although it's probably her least mature, is the most enjoyable of the three I have. Why four stars instead of five? Hate to say it, but although she's gorgeous, hard-working, and successful (?), she simply misses notes. Flat, sharp, or just plain off a whole, and it's all over every album. Jane Siberry can get away with it because it's written in, deliberately, but I think Julia just misses 'em. Don't sweat it though- my wife LOVES the fact that this pro sounds no better than she sometimes! So yes, good stuff, just irritating to you music people."
2,Be careful - this is the MCE version,"If you are looking for a reasonably priced Hauppauge PVR 250 for use with MythTV, this *isn't* it. This is the MCE version, a fact which Amazon cleverly left out of the product title (although it is present in the fine print), and it is 50-50 whether this will work with MythTV. Look for the Model 980 instead. I bought this one by mistake... learn from my misfortune."
2,The bag is different than the picture,"I liked the smaller foot print shown in the manufacturer's photo. However, when I got it, the bag is clearly bigger. See my photo above.Didn't want to use it. The packaging and the label is the same as the item, but the bag is different.Buy it if you like the new style, I suppose."
5,Waiting for Book 2!!!,This was an unbelievable book! I found myself making my child go to bed 30min early just so I could hurry and start reading. J.T. and Lesi captured my heart quicker than any characters from any other book. I literally laughed outloud reading some of J.T.'s comments......but that was one of the reasons I did fall in love with him. This book was quite an emotional roller coaster and I will admit I got angry somewhat when certain misfortunes befell them. I believe this is a great read for any person.....whether from the South or not. Be prepared to laugh your head off on one page and cry your eyes out on the next. Great job Mr. Cother!!! I'm ready for Book #2. Hope its coming soon!!!
2,It's an ok book,"This book provides an adequate review style outline for respiratory care. However, if you can only buy two books, I would recommend Persing's book, and the written registry exam review by Wojciechowski. I think this book was a waste of my money. Also, the CD-Rom doesn't work. Other options for practicing these exams include purchasing individual exams from www.goamp.com. They provide you with feed back, so you understand why your answer is wrong and another answer is the best choice."
4,I bought it for the pictures . . .,"Actually, I bought it for the hemodynamics. I found (and still find) the book to be quite helpful. The layout is very basic - just the listing of information. That almost put me to sleep occasionally because I do better with an outline style (I use this and a Persing review together and that's perfect for me). The illustrations and tables in the Sills are definitely among the better I've seen in these books."
5,Dangerous,FDA Warning: This product may be dangerous while operating a vehicle and may have the following side effects:* Excessive speeding (Lead Foot Syndrome)* Interruption of normal vehicular conversation (Excessive Compulsive Volume)* Excessive loss of income due to increased confrontation with vehicular Law EnforcementPlease use in moderation and only with the guidance of a professional. Thank you.
5,amazing soundtrack but be warned.,if u like the game then u most likely like the soundtrack. if u've never played the game and like trance (somekind of progressive/hard trance blend) then u'll like the soundtrack. this OST can cause ur right foot to become very heavy while driving...lol. think Initial D OST-Eurobeat+hi engery trance= Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 2 OST.
3,but but but,"WRITTEN IN BLOOD: THE TRAIL & THE HUNT, copyright 1989, drove me mad. The use of the word 'but' to begin and end sentences, once noticed, became impossible to ignore. I have to assume that no editor got his/her hands on this little missive and can only hope Mr. Colins availed himself of the services of an editor in later work. There was also an annoying use of Paul Harveys sentence repeat/pause that really only works with the spoken word. The stories were all interesting however, if badly done."
4,Good Technical info.,"Could have used some more accurate three views, in the case of the X-35 any at all would have helped. The book, like all books from Mr. Sweetman, contained an excellent technical breakdown of the aircraft involved and the programs in place to complete them. Sweetman seems to have a nack for finding rare photos of the subjects in his books, another plus for those who use them as research materials. Overall I found it to be an excellent book full of details about a program that is still difficult to research through other sources."
3,Just incase of wrong info.,"Just incase this book does not tell you the Joint Strike Fighter is not going to replace the F-16 totally. It is only going to take away some ground attack responsibility, but the F-16 is still going to be used in the Air to Air role. This is just incase the book doesn't tell you that."
4,One time read,"This book had very good information, but purchasing-wise itisn't a smart idea. How many times can you read about howa certain star died?(unless you loan the book to someone)It is well-written and I found it hard to put down, but it wasa one-time read."
3,Death of famous stars interesting read,"The book is an easy read as most of the stories regarding the star's deaths are brief, yet informative. I learned nothing new from this book, most of the information was information I had heard or read in other books, and there weren't as many photos as I would have liked, however, it is still a good book to read if you, like me, are as interested in how a star dies as well as how they lived."
5,Hollywood Book of Death,This was one of the most obscure and interesting books I have ever read.If you are a movie buff this is a great reference book on some your favorite past and present movie and screen stars.
2,MISTAKE ON THE BACK COVER!,"The name author's name is spelled slightly incorrectly on the back cover.It says James Robert Par ish"". There should be no space between the letters ""r"" and ""i"".Another mistake I believe I have uncovered is the way on page 311 the author (Parish) claims that the late John Erik Hexum played a photographer on the series ""Cover Up"". Actually in that series Hexum played a model!"
2,number twoo....,"so now i have spend some new time about doing nothing else than looking,wath about the ( REAL THING ) ???"
3,not a toy,Have been looking for this for some time. I work on the H-13 in the army and wanted a model of same to display. Enjoyed putting it together. It looks nice on my shelf.
3,too many small pieces,"the detail is incredible,down to tiny-teeny do-hickie that you need a magnifying glass and a tweezer to put together. you will need a lot of time and patient."
2,Don't waste your money!!,"E. Schmeisser wrote a book about the ""Tekki series"" but didn't it very fine. The pictures are bad, a lot of techniques are pointless and I'm still searching for principles in this book. I can't hardly imagine that Funakoshi et al learned these useless techniques to defend yourself against big, strong men.Look for Iain Abernethy's books and videos!!"
2,eh,"These are a steal. A bargain. The style, brand, color, everything about these glasses is perfect, which I know from trying them on in multiple stores. I chose to purchase online for a fraction of the price. The pair I received did not sit right. One ear peice was significantly higher than the other. So much so that one of my eye brows was completely visible, whereas the other was not when I put them on. When I set them on the table, the did not lie flat either, so I had to return them and ended up just buying them at the store."
5,The Taming of Lord Whitfield,"A delightful Regency set in London when women weren't supposed to be as independent as Miss Lila Appleby. She earned her living by teaching young ladies to behave properly in the ton. Her neighbor, Lord Whitfield, held rollicking parties which annoyed her yet intrigued her strong willed students. Strong characterization and fast paced plot make this a must read."
1,Try Before You Buy,"I have enjoyed tycoon games in the past and bought this one because it was one of the top rated games. I have only played it for about an hour or 2. It's presentation turned me off. Game appears tedious to get in to, link graphics look like a cheap kids game. Maybe I'll get to it someday, but I suggest that you try it before you buy it."
3,Not a good game unless you have an XP,i downloaded the demo on my windows me and it didn't even work if i even bought the game it either wouldn't work or would go really slow but i do like the rct1&2 they are awsome i would defnetly buy this game if i had an XP though
2,"Good Game, but Has lots of glitches","This game is very fun, it has a coaster cam, new rides, good 3D, but it won't work on even some of the most powerfull home Computers, wait until atari has fixed the game glitches , until then , make sure thatyou check the requirements on the box so that you know if it will work on your computer.*Update* If Your Computer will not play the game try increasing your paging file. In this game I made the Top Thrill Dragster, and lots of other real coasters. This is a fun game."
4,Loved it,my nephew thought it was a great extension to the tycoons he already owns. I think there is 1 or 2 more I have to get. I know I'll be looking in amazon soon. They have great products and good people at amazon and the party I bought the game from.
3,better than the last two,the last two games have sort of depressing music but they were good. this game is good also. i like that you can ride the rides now. i play it from time to time. the first couple of senerios are eazy but some are hard. i haven't beat them all.
4,RCT1 still the best,"I love my new RCT3, but....... RCT1 still rules.I like being able to ride the coasters, but it gets old quick. I guess it will be better once I start designing my own, but I have been just playing the games for now.Lots of new extras and such too........ I guess the more I play the more I will get use to it, but for now Its 4 stars...."
1,GOSH!!!,"This is one of the most UGLIEST dolls i've ever seen! Her smile just kreeps me out!!! All barbie dolls are ugly freaks!! All barbies where the same kind of makeup, and have the same smile!! Brat dolls are WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY better!!!!!!! Gosh, people open up your eyes!! Don't look at these ugly barbie dolls!!!"
4,Barbie lover,My 4 year old received this as a Christmas gift. She absolutely loves it. She has memorized the song that Anneliese sings. She has fun for hours playing with her Barbies.
5,Very Nice Barbie!,This Barbie is not for play. It is a collectable for my granddaughter. We have it on display. Very reasonable price too.
3,Duet with Erika is darling,"My daughter plays with this item a lot. The duet the Annaliese sings with Erika is just darling, but she's cute without Erika too. One draw back - The clothes are difficult to remove & put on for tiny hands."
4,gorgeous!,"this doll is absolutely beautiful! i love her gorgeous dress! the reason i gave it 4 stars is because it is hard 2 get erika and annelise 2 sing the duet 2gether. but besides that, this doll is beautiful and i recommend it 4 n e one!"
5,Ali in Canada,I THINK PRINCESS ANNELIESE IS THE PRETTIEST DOLL OF THEM ALL. ANNLIESE IS THE PRETTIEST DOLL OVER 'EM ALL. aLSO OVER THE UGLY BRATZ DOLLS. I LOVE HER GOWN AND SERAFINA
5,Princess Anneliese Doll,This is a fun doll that sings the first line of I'm just like you which my toddler loves. It is for her birthday so I havent given it to her yet but I know she will love it!
3,Review By Prateek,"The doll is ok, not as good as one expect after seeing it online. Anyway, for 6$ (including shiping) is worth."
3,Princess Annelise,This doll is great if you like barbie type dolls. My 5 and 4 year olds each have had one for a year and music is still working. I get tired of hearing the songs but they are not loud and obnoxious. The voice quality is actually pretty good. My 2 year old loved it so much that we got her on. she takes it everywhere 24 hours a day. It still looks and sounds good although the hair get tangled as you would expect.
3,pretty doll,i got this doll when it was onsale for like 9.00 and free shipping so it was a great deal for such a pretty doll
4,Fun!!,"I saw my cousin playing with this toy contantly when I came to visit. She was crazy about it. I took a good look at it, and it seemed really cute. The make-up isn't overdone and I think she looks pretty. My cousin bashes her barbies around but the only thing wrong I saw with this Barbie was that the hair was tangled, like most hair gets. But this is a CHILD's toy, and isn't really a good collectors item. And luckily, the doll is at a good price right now. So... yea... enjoy!"
5,ANNELISE ROXS!!,"I BOUGHT THIS DOLL AND LOVED HER.I USUALLY HATE BARBIES THE SING BUT THIS ONE IS GREAT.SHE HAS ONLY A LITTLE BUTTON ON HER BACK AND IT DOESNT STICK OUT WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE YOU CAN PUT OTHER OUTFITS ON.BUY HER IS YOU LIKE HER, I DID AND DO NOT REGRET IT!!!!!P.S HER OUTFIT IS SOO PRETTY."
1,Inadequate and Inexplicable Characters,"This is a bad book. The plot is melodramatic and implausible. The characters are one-dimensional and implausible -- in fact, down right unbelievable. The dialogue is stiff, moralistic, hyperbolic and implausible.It reminds me of the picaresque novels of Spain -- without the humor . The main character rushes from conversation to conversation -- many without forwarding the story one whit. There is no reason for the conversations except to fill paper.To be honest, I cannot think of one redeeming feature of this book."
2,I did try!!,"Wow, I feel like I am betraying Kimberly Cates, but UGH!! O.K. this was just a bit too much. The whole story was just sort of ridiculous actually. I do not even know what to say. Oh, the one thing that got me the most was Redmayne's eyes and how we were always possibly maybe seeing compassion, sorrow???? It really was just such a silly book. I put it down three times and then kept picking it up again because so many of you liked it. I never saw why."
2,How slow can you go?,"I really wanted to like this book. I got three quarters of the way through before I gave up and I'll read anything. Kimberly Cates writes well but it took 200 pages to cover a two day period. Okay, she covers it with great detail. When I got to the three and a half pages about Fallon's dancing and then she lands on Ciaran with her bottom and her breasts pressed against him at the same time, I quit."
1,WARNING,"PLEASE READ EVERY SINGLE DETAILS FROM THE SELLER'S PROFILE, INCLUDING THE SHIPPING POLICY. OTHERWISE THEY ARE GONNA RIP OFF EVERY DOLLAR OUTA UR POCKET."
1,Waste of $9.99,"What a disappointment! Nothing but a series of very short snippets of music, with the entire CD running well under an hour in length.I purchased the CD based in large part upon the glowing reviews, as well as hearing some of the composer's other film music.After listening, I cannot comprehend all the praise; this score left me cold and uninspired. I will never listen to it again; wish I could return it to Amazon for a refund.Much ado about nothing, and overpriced to boot. I would give it zero stars if I could."
1,This one stays on the shelf,"I usually write reviews only when I love a book, but I'll make an exception this time. There aren't a whole lot of third-party Informix books, and my employer was paying, so I pretty much bought all the obvious ones. Joe Lumbley's ""Informix DBA Survival Guide"" is always on my desk, Glenn Miller's ""Informix Basics"" is handy if I have a basic question, and Elizabeth Suto's ""Informix Performance Tuning"" is invaluable (it's actually not a bad one to read first because the explanations of the architecture and key concepts are so concise and clear). But this one lives on the shelf. It's way shorter than it looks (big type font), and whatever I need to know about is usually not in the index.I hate to criticize authors because I are one, and I know how much effort goes into a book, but this one just doesn't do it for me."
1,This book lacks up-to-date information.,"If you're an Informix DBA like I am, you know that the biggest headache of any DBA is doing database archives. This book does not coverusing onarchive and C.D. claims to havefinished before onbar was generally available.Save your money, folks. The Informix manualsfrom Informix, Inc. tell tons more than this book.No new insights. No neat tricks here."
2,Not the best DBA Resource,Very hard to understand. No tips or tricks are mentioned. I feel there are better resources out there on this subject.
4,Storm Trooper Rocks,"This a great storm trooper. Its true that its not that articulated, but for looks (scale and size) and playing with it is just awesome."
3,Couple of issues,"Received unit and was missing the end nozzle. Also trigger linkage not working correctly. Started and ran well (though not able to control the speed), comfortable to wear.Called Solo 800 number and talked to a technician -- VERY responsive --- they are shipping a replacement end nozzle and are sending UPS to pickup the unit to repair it in Newport VA (home office)and ship it back.Great service so far - will try and rereview the item performance once I get it back."
3,Good B Movie,"I love horror and thrillers. I had a little trouble through this one. It had the B humor. Some twists and of course the gruesome effects. It's about an old family curse to keep ones love forever. But of course the curse is not what you would call love. If you get an splinter from the tree you will become part of the tree, never breaking free. It is one to enjoy on a rainy day or boring friday night. not for kids though. So with that said, Enjoy!Haunted Forest"
3,Classic Horror Concept with a good twist,"This movie is just another rendition of an old native american mother earth tale, however, it does have a great twist in the plot to keep you entertained and enthralled. The casting and acting are subpar, but if you can put up with it, you will find this movie to be better than average and a great ""B"" moive."
2,Not another god movie!!,Ok the movie has a lot of great actors and actresses and beautiful women. Special effects were well done also. But the biblical ending was more than I could stomach. The moral of the story is typical western christiananity. Commit suicide and go to hell otherwise god will save you and show you the way. Strange concidering it was supposed to be made in a country primarily made up of eastern religions. Great propaganda for all you Christians out there trying to convert the world to your beliefs.
3,For Future Test Takers...Dont buy this book,"Well where to begin...first of all, the whole text is in font 8 so you will get blind by the time you are done reading its tiny text. The topics are covered inadequatley. I used Princeton Review and all the questions were similar."
2,NOT HELPFUL...,"This book does not contain enough information. I read it in 3-4 days and felt like it had not done me any good. It's ok for getting practice questions and practice essays but not for studying. In order to study for the ap biology test, I recommend getting the barron's ap biology and the cliff notes ap biology. Those two books are the only books needed to ace the AP biology exam."
2,Kind of boring...,"I've read quite a few books about Marilyn Monroe, and this was not as great as others. The ""conversations"" do not even start until somewhere about page 50. A lot of emphasis on Arthur Miller, her third husband. It just seemed to go on and on and it couldn't keep my interest. Some nice things said, but if you read the book ""Goddess"", most of the things Weatherby is quoted as saying in that book are the few conversations that he had with her. Not all bad, being that I bought it used for a really low price. Not worth much more though. Just another addition to my Marilyn collection."
1,SUCKs,This product creates fuzzy noises and makes it impossible to record anything decent. I used it for my external mic and it sucks.
4,Worth Buying,"A good CD, a lot of fun to listen to. Listeners should be aware, however, that CD no longer approves of his past cussing and drug abusing ways. Consequently, he has changed some fo the lyrics to his songs. ""Long Haired Country Boy"", no longer mentions drinking or drug use at all. I am not stating that this is either a good or a bad thing, but I think it is something that readers should know."
3,Just one omission,"There is another recording of ""Goodbye"" by N.Melba on Victor 95012,released in the US in 1905.I wonder why it is not included in this ""complete"" Romophone release?"
2,Almost Completely Useless Book,"This is a very short book filled with tones of completely random and largely useless facts. It is another collection of trivia, and not a very large one at that - the book is only 184 pages long, and each fact (most of which are not longer than a single sentence) occupies a whole page. It provides some amusing material for those situations in life when you are not going anywhere, and yet don't have the time to read something of a substance - dentist's waiting room, hairdresser, bathroom, etc. It could also serve as an inexpensive gift for people that you don't care about all that much. Otherwise, it's a rather disappointing book."
4,"Captains Log, Captain Speaking!",The Star Treck Fan collective contains all the best episodes featuring each captain from every season voted in by fans. It has new interviews with the cast members of star treck.I recommend it to all Star Treck fans.
4,"Aye, Captain! Great Collection!","This set would have received 5 Stars hands down if it wasn't for Enterprise's ""These Are The Voyages..."" being included, which even as an Enterprise fan I consider the worst Star Trek episode of all time. I find it hard to believe that any sane Enterprise fan would vote for that, so it was either voted by fans who hate Enterprise out of spite, or TNG fans who like the Riker and Troi connection. I am pleased to see ""Flashback"" in here, as I'm a big Sulu fan and am still waiting for ""Star Trek: Excelsior"" to at least have a TV mini-series.Great set overall...highly recommended! Now, where is the Mirror Universe collection?"
4,Good Star Trek. Cheap DVDs,"I like the episodes picked for the Originial Series, Enterprise, and Voyager. The Deep Space Nine and Next Generation episodes were not necessarily the best of those shows. As usual there was absolutely no commentary on the shows like there is on most other science fiction DVDs. The extras are very short, and there is not much to them. It seems like Star Trek DVDs always fall short of other DVDs such as Doctor Who, 24, and about any other type of DVDs out there."
3,Captain's Directing their Picks,"I like all the episodes picked, especially the Voyager ones, but it seems that all of the Captains predictably picked their ""favorite"" episodes as the episodes that they themselves directed. You do have the fan favorites to fall back on and it is a good broad range of favorites, so it gets 3 out of 5 for me."
3,heavy duty bike but needed adjustment,"Bought this bike for my 8 year old daughter , very well made heavy duty construction. I t weighs more than the average 20"" bike but we had to take it to the bike shop for adjustment/repair as soon as we got it. The gears would slip and it would not change gears with out the chain coming off."
3,Cannot use it yet,"Although this bike is of great value, we received it and had to order new rims to start with: both the front and the rear wheels needed to be trued badly so we preferred getting new rims. The lowest seat's position is too high for our daughter, so we are also getting a new shorter seat for her. I'm sure even after buying these elements, the overall value is still quite nice."
2,Parts not fixed right and they are rusting easily,Parts are rusting easily. Parts are not precession manufactured. Manufacturer did not supply the gear to assemble the bike.
4,Great bike for the money.,"We purchased this bike for our 7 year-old daughter after having no luck finding a mountain bike with gears in any store for less than $200. I was a little hesitant to buy the bike online without having actually seen it, but it got good reviews so I went ahead and took the risk. We are very happy with the bike and my daughter just loves it. She loves the color, it shifts smoothly and she is easily able to work the shifter. The brakes have taken a couple of adjustments, but this is normal for any bike. It was simple to put together, and even with the free shipping offer from Amazon it arrived in just a few days. Just as an aside, there is no room in the middle of the bike to install a water bottle (which my daughter really wanted), but we were able to fit one on the front of the handlebars. All-in-all it is a great-looking, solid little bike for the money!"
5,Great Second Time,"The first box with the bike, or what was left of it inside was poured out onto my doorstep from the UPS truck, and it looked like it had taken an IED or two on it's way to me. The bike inside was in pretty bad shape more from a really bad packing and boxing job than from UPS. I called and Amazon was great about sending a replacement right away, and it arrived via a route that was not through Iraq. It looks and works great, with just minor adjustments, and my eight year old loves it. She is average height and it fits her well. She got the hang of the hand brakes and shifter right away too. Great value for the money."
1,The Funniest Part Is I Bought This,What was i thinking this is a book for dumb people that will make them feel smarter knowing there is someone out there with a lower intelligence level then them i want my money back
1,Garbage Waste Of Paper,This Author must have his friends write reviews for him this book is a complete waste of ink and paper
1,NOT WORTH READING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,MAN THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE THE ONLY THING I ENJOYED WAS BURNING IT IN MY FIREPLACE
1,Come on this is the worst book i have ever read!,Hello i feel it is important for feedback so we can help each other steer clear of time wasting and money wasting products well this one is a real stinker what a waste. my message to the author dont quit your day job .
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I gotta tell you the only truthful reviews are the bad ones. The good ones must have been written by the author himself.
1,O.M.G. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,I DONT HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS PILE BUT IT REALLY SUCKS AND IT DOES NOT DESERVE ANY STARS FOR THIS
1,This Book Should Be Named RAW SEWAGE,Listen people i never waste my time writing reviews but this book stinks i wish i had seen a review that was truthful about this book i would have never purchased it well what can you do
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I FEEL SO RIPPED OFF I WOULD NOT BUY THIS BOOK FOR FIFTY CENTS IF I WAS ABLE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN WHAT A WASTE
1,It is too old!,"The content of this book (1988) is no more valid. The world of c++ has changed a lots. The book doesn't mention iostream, standard template library, such as linked list, string, vector, etc. Even the syntax is sort of old fashion. If you are a beginner, the book is not for you. If you are a librarian, buy it to prove that your library has history."
4,Brings back the good times,I purchased the box-set as a gift for my father. We had a great time watching a few episodes. It brought back memories (before cable TV) of when my Dad & I would watch Hogan's Heroes after dinner (as long as my homework was finished).
5,A good cure for boring TV,"I ordered this set for my wife for Christmas, but we started watching it as soon as it arrived. We have had cable and satelite TV, all those channels, and mostimes nothing good on. This show goes back to a different era both in setting and production, yet the humor remains timeless without being too campy (ha-ha). I remember this series as a child but have found a deeper appreciation of this situation comedy. We have not quite gone through the entire set yet but I'm sure we will before too long. Thank you amazon.com for offering this product."
5,Hogan`s Heros - The Complete Series,Just as Funny the time I used to watch them on TV. This time I can enjoy the jokes I missed and otherwise lively up a dull day with a little laughter. Would reccommend them to anyone.
1,Quality control is where it's at...,"This is supposed to be a two-DVD set. The first time I received it, the first disc would play about 2/3's of the way through, then freeze up. My DVD player wouldn't even recognize the second disc as being a disc. Back it went for replacement. The second set I received played the first disc okay until about 2/3's the way through, then it would start pixelizing and hanging up. The second disc, although labeled as ""Disc 2"" was just another Disc 1. Back it went. Amazon refunded my money and wouldn't send me another replacement. If I were you I'd keep looking."
1,Description wrong,"Got this in the other day, when I went to use it I noticed its 1/2 inch drive. It clearly states 3/8 in the description, 1/2 is too big and bulky for this tool!"
2,Where the hell is Julian??,Why make 3 out of the 4 characters? Whose marketing idea was that? I spent most of my time shopping looking for the other doll. Very disappointed to find out he didn't exist.
3,Mattel please get it right!,"I wanted to add that yes it is a huge mistake that Julian is missing...I guess they thought they were saving us money!!! But really no, I feel it is wasted without a Julian doll, and yes we can buy a cheaper Ken, which I have, but he does not look the same as the box shows. Hoping they bring him out after christmas at least... to save us parents! I would have given higher stars if Julian was here... so if he apperas this will really mean a 4/5 star product!"
2,'The King' has broken his arm...,"This is the 4th male doll we've owned from Mattel to have a broken arm. We've had three seperate Alan dolls from the Happy Family Collection with this problem. I must say that the company was very good in handling this, so I thought it must have been unique to the particular doll. My 8yr old then received King Dominick as a gift. Lo and behold, his arm was broken in no time at all, but unfortunately not before all of the packaging had been disposed of! So, let's see if I can exchange this with no box and no reciept. I'd like to say I'd never buy these again but the girls beg for them!I,too, would have liked to see a seperate Julian doll. I have 4 girls close in age who like to play together so someone has to use the 'pretend' character- the Ken masquerading as Julian."
4,My daughter loves he princess & pauper dolls,"My daughter is four and loves all the barbie movies, so of course I had to get the princess and the pauper the day it came out. Then she received the three dolls for her birthday once they came out. I was disappointed that Julian was not sold seperately, we now have two princesses because of that. But she wanted Julian and her aunt gave her a gift card to Target and they were on clearance just after christmas. So we were lucky to get the complete set, but now we just have double princess dolls/clothes and Julian clothes. My daughter just loves playing with the complete set!"
3,What is Mattel trying to teach our kids?,"I was so happy to read so many other reviews with the same complaint that I have about there not being a separate Julian doll. What kind of message is Mattel trying to send our kids? Are they trying to say that it's okay for 1 guy to pretend that he's 2 different people so that he can be with 2 different women? Like other reviewers, I also bought an extra Ken doll for my daughter to dress as Julian."
2,disappointment,Disappointed that Tutor Julian is not sold as a separate doll. My granddaughter loves playing with her Barbie/Ken doll (Princess and the Pauper) but wants a Julian doll. Can't find one anywhere.
2,WHERE IS JULIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????,WHat in the world was matel thinking???Why dont they have a Julian doll like King dom. ? I would pay extra for him..And i just guess i am going to have to find Prince Daniel for swan lake to play the role of JUlian...VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING.....
1,Not a good idea,I feel the same way my daughter would love to play along with the movie and there are times that King Dominic and Julian are in the same scene. I did bought my daugter both Princess Anelise and the Erika dolls hoping that I can get the Ken dolls to match but I am not sure if I would buy 2 of the same doll.
3,Tutor Julian is disguised as Prince Daniel from swan lake...,"Buy Prince Daniel from Swan Lake doll and dress him in Julians clothes that come with King Dominic. This will give you the exact doll that they show you on the back of the Princess and the Pauper Boxes.The Daniel doll also comes with boots and a crown, which they do not give you 2 of in the Dominic box. I have no idea why they did not make there own Tutor Julian doll like they did Dominic, this makes no sense. What I did is took Julians clothes out of Dominics box dressed the other doll in the clothes and then stuck him in the same box as King Dominic and it turned out very nicely. My daughter will be happy to see all the Princess and the Pauper dolls under the Christmas tree!!"
2,King Dominic and Julian are not the same person!,"I agree with all the reviews! How is my daughter supposed to play with Dominic and Julian at the same time? How can the 4 characters ride in the carriage or have a wedding together, if you only have one doll! I could understand if Dominic came with the costume of the servant he disguised himself as, in the movie. It is unfair that I now need to buy a Ken doll to wear the Julian costume. The company should offer a free Ken to whoever purchased King Dominic!"
2,There should be two seperate male dolls!,"My daughter got the wedding and vanity set to go with her dolls, which makes no sense without a blond julian doll. I saw the group set but she already had the wedding clothes, the barbie and the kelly doll. I used a regular ken but would be happy to purchase a julian seperately to fully complete the set."
2,"Tutur Julian: the lost ""Princess and the Pauper""","My review is this; they shouldn't have Tutor Julian on the back of the Princess and the Pauper boxes if they have no intentions on selling the product. I've been looking everywhere for this product. My daughter also will be upset and how do you explain that to a 4 year old, she's receiving them for Christmas. They want to reinact the movie, completely. So I have to give my review a low rating do to the product availablity."
2,"Mattel, please read your feedback","Just to add to the voices..my 6 year old daughter knows that Julian is blonde and has begged for the two Ken dolls so she can recreate the wedding just as she watched it. I didn't know there was a wedding set, so I set out to get the dolls, only to find out that I have no way to get a Julian. While the Dominick doll is well-made, there should be another blonde one. Mattel dropped the ""doll"" this time."
3,Why doesn't he sing ?,"This King Dominic was nice because he is easy for the girls to dress but Mattel shouldn't have scrimped on a voice track--especially when they are charging the same price as the Erika and Annelise dolls. As for the absence of Julian, I just took another Ken that looks like Julian and dressed him in Julian's outfit. Unfortunately, they have to share the boots, but I may take the reviewer's advice about finding the Swan Lake Ken as a solution the boot problem."
1,BORING! THEY ALL LOOK THE FREAKING SAME!,ALL these seasonal ken and barbie dolls that come out ALL look the same. Minus the clothes change. Can we get a new face mold mattel? It's getting old fast! And these dolls are overpriced. They should be no more than $8 b/c of the outfit included only. I mean every single ken looks the same. More face molds are needed FAST!
1,ifm tuner,Not at all what I was expecting. The product looks fine but does not work with the psp slim.
1,did not work,the PSP iFM FM Tuner did not work at all... and it doesnt fit into my sony psp the tuner cable thing is a little small to get it in......
1,PSP Slim Owners Beware,"Nowhere does it say that this does not work with the PSP slim. Unfortunately, I threw away the packaging and now I am stuck with it. But it is useless to me. Bummer."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Doesn't work with the newer 3000-series. The ""serial"" part of the plus isn't compatible with the new jack.Wish I'd have know that before buying it.Otherwise, looks like it'd be great if you have an older model PSP."
1,Do not work.,I was very disapoint because do not work. I order for PSP 2000 and it was for another PSP.So my nephew can't use it. And I lost my money. And he is very sad.
3,"It's okay, but...","I think the book is all right. Most of the reason that I don't care for it is that I'm not really a crazy-obsessed Pokemon fan like I used to be. It's good if you're learning to draw Pokemon, or if you want to become a fanartist. Pokemon are good things to start with because they're somewhat easy to draw. I'm not a huge Pokemon fanartist like I used to be so now I'm on to drawing other things, but the book is still good. Be warned though, it does not teach you all the Pokemon there are. You have to learn to draw the rest on your own!"
4,Good book,"I got this book out of a school catolog,and in the catolog it said it showed you how to draw ALL of the pok'emon but it doesn't,it doesn't even have Togapi! It does have some good pok'emon though,like Pikachu,Charrizard,and Meowth.I recommend this book to people ages 8 and up."
4,Keeps Kids Busy,This is really a great toy to give to a Pokemon Fanatic. My younger brother loves Pokemon and now knows how to draw it. He is truly amazed at how good he can draw his favorite monsters. A must by if you want to get an inexpensive toy for a Pokemon kid. The only thing he comlains about is that there are only about twenty Pokemon to draw.
3,"Functional, but needs work","It's fairly simple and works as such.The handle is unbearable. More than 2 minutes of carrying and you'll need phys therapy.The first unit I got, one of the nuts was stripped. Given the depth of thread, it would be physically impossible to do this tightening by hand and the embedded nut had every appearance of being overbored, so I think it was just a bad nut. It still worked in that the pole would not easily pull out of the stand/nut (I would still need to unthread it) but it wouldn't tighten, making it a little more wobbly.Amazon shipped out a replacement and I had it in a few days, with very little hassle.I would only take off 1/2 star for the bad nut. Quality control could get this if they threaded in the legs, but that would add a lot of cost so I understand.I took off a 1.5 stars for the bad handle. No excuse for that."
3,Projector Table Shelf,The shelf arrived with a chip in the corner. It takes a little while to get the shelf fixed in place and level. The shelf depends on friction and gravity to stay in place.
4,Great table easy to use,This is a great table and easy to use and store. Only problem is one of the legs is very hard to screw in place.
5,"Sturdy - a great option for the Epson 3010, 3020, 5010 and 5020","I purchased this stand for use with somewhat large and heavy Epson 5010e. I am pleased with the performance of the stand. It seems pretty durable thus far. I suppose I wish it was capable of reaching a few inches taller, but it meets our needs very well. Recommended for people looking for something besides a ceiling mount."
4,Outstanding Product,"From the first day that we used the projector stand it has reminded us of a great product that has met all our expectations! It is sturdy, lots of shelf space, portable and easy to assemble! We are very satisfied with this purchase!"
2,A genuine problem is detailed for the future,"This book contains a lot of facts concerning the abuse of the Social Security funds we send and have sent to Washington.The author is a bleading heart liberal and bashes Bush throughout. He could have better spent the time Bush bashing by offering readers some what-if situations such as ""How would privitatization of a portion of the funds affect the future Social Security recipients?"""
1,Worthless regardless of the cost.,"Very poor mechanism in spite of the ""ball bearings"". Turntable was lop-sided on the bearing frame and when picked up and turned over several of the ball bearings fell to the floor. They obviously were out of the track already, as there was no way to replace them. In spite of the cost of nearly $30, the cost of returning it was also prohibitive and the return policy had lots of ""conditions"". Chalked up to a bad purchasing decision; will be more careful when purchasing items sold and shipped from sellers other that Amazon."
2,"Product ok, service poor.","I had to send the product back due to the fact that is was too big for the cupboard. So, the product is good. However, it arrived more than a week late. I received contradicting information when I spoke to customer service and had to call them three times before getting the correct info. I will not buy from Organize.com again"
4,Lazy Susan,I bought this to store all my spices in the kitchen cupboard. It's handy to be able to find everything. It is a little noisy while it's turning and that's why I only gave it 4 stars.
3,Spintray,"Fits perfectly in my new corner cupboard. Unfortunately, I ordered 2 and one had a large piece of plastic broken off. This was due to extremely poor packaging. I immediately contacted Amazon, who forwarded my email to Stacks & Stacks, the supplier, and 9 days later I have not had any response. Poor customer service."
1,Not the greatest thing in the world,"When we received this lasy susan, we thought the size was super - it's huge!!! But... it does not move well at all. It's like the bearings that are suppose to make this go are sticking or rubbing against each other - and that's with nothing sitting on top of it. Imagine if you add a little weight to the thing. On the other hand, if you'd like a big plastic serving plate, then this is what you'll want to buy."
3,off to a bad start,"I love this lazy susan because it has a nice outside lip on it, so nothing can spin off of it. Plus the sharp, white plastic makes anything on it look nice. However, it came loosely packed in shredded paper with no plastic bag or other covering and some of the paper was embedded into the crack between the pieces that rotate, so it didn't spin well. Trying to gently get the paper out,a ball bearing got out of position inside which really screwed it up! Finally, just as I was about to give up and my husband was nagging me to ""send the $#@! thing back,"" I got the inspiration to tape it firmly on top of another lazy susan I had a TV on that miraculously matched exactly up in size. So now I love it, especially it's raised aspect and it spins divinely. So all's well that ends well I suppose, except that now I need one for the TV haha!"
5,"Easy to use, very good product","What I loved most about this product is that unlike other spinning trays that I have purchased for my cabinets, this one did not require any installation. Just open the box, put it where you need it, and you're ready to go. It stays balanced, even when your load is somewhat uneven. I would definitely recommend it as a good way to make everything on your cabinet shelf easy to reach."
2,Very limiting,"Must say I was expecting a bit more than a 4 pages of info. Alot of basic tourist info that is easily accessible on google. I've bought a few of these single male guides, and found the best of the genre is ""The Hedonist""."
3,Informative but expensive!,"OK OK so maybe I could of joined a website and searched for a couple hours and got all this information for free. But what can't you get for free now days. This is a cool guide for people that don't have time to do their own research and/or hate having to carry a bunch of scrap paper with jotted notes to yourself. It does give you a list of hotels, night clubs, termas , etc. if they are the best is up to you. Cool guide, nifty idea but a little to expensive for what's offered. But then again what's $15 if your spending over $3k on a trip."
1,"NOT A BOOK, ONLY A 'BROCHURE'","Don't waste your time with this. It is a 1 page brochure. Its more like the lonely man's guide to rio, since it seems to focus on strip clubs and prostitutes. Maybe thats your bag, but its not for me. Check out Rio for Partiers instead. It is a real travel guide that tells you where the hot spots in rio are each night of the week."
3,"Good ""OVERVIEW"" book for the breed","The book was really good at explaining the history of rottweilers. I was not very happy that it did not go into specifics about training the dogs/puppies. I am really interested in proven tips to train this type of dog. Very descriptive about picking out puppies. The pictures were really sharp and had vivid color. One quality issue I had, was that the paperback started to come apart after first viewing the inside of the book."
3,Nice Anemometer (w/ RH),"This thermo-anemometer gave surprisingly accurate relative humidity readings. However, it's impossible to get it to provide temperature readings as well. Additionally, the 'slide-in-slide-out' feature leaves some pretty nasty scratches on the unit during field use."
1,What is the point of this movie existing?,"In Butchered 7 dopey teenagers spend their last weekend of the summer before going off to college on a nearby island to party together. Unfortunately for them a famous axe murderer who escaped from prison a few days earlier shows up on the island too. Guess what happens?This is a terrible movie. The plot, if you can even say it has one, is so hackneyed and clichéd it's hard to believe this movie was made in 2010. The acting is not great, but I've seen much worse. The directing is paint-by-numbers. Butchered is barely over an hour long but drags on because it's so boring. The killer has no personality and only the barest back story. The actual murders are beyond dull, many of them even happen off screen. Except for some nudity and profanity this could be rated G."
1,BORING AND VERY WEAK,"After a good opening scene this cheap 'movie' descends into boredom with a quickness! I love cheap horror movies but only the ones that are entertaining! This is one seriously boring crapfest. Only watch this thing if your idea of a good horror movie is: 1 - watching a bunch of lame people stand around talking at a party for a long time (small talk - nothing of substance), 2 - watching people lounge on a boat for a long time. 3 - watching people running endlessly through the woods for 10 minutes at a time with occasional shots of a killer's feet walking only to end in a cheesy shot of a murder weapon being raised and then a cop-out cutaway with no FX! Absolutely NO effort is made to entertain the audience. This is one of the really crappy ones folks."
2,IF I HAD A CLEAVER...,"As mentioned in fellow reviewers comments, BUTCHERED harkens back to 70's slashers. There is a lot of ""safe"" gore and few surprises and includes a predictable final scene. My problem with BUTCHERED lies within its cliche-written and padded script that obstructs the suspense and the cast's ineffectual performances.Again, the supposed high school grads look ten years older than 17 but what's new?BUTCHERED isn't the worst movie I've ever seen but there are many much better."
4,Horror Can Be Fun,"Fun, campy low budget movie.. a definite throw back to 80's thriller. Crazy murderer escapes, resumes killing spree on unsuspecting group of young people...but that's what made it nostalgic.A predictable plot, a touch of humor, edge of your seat moments, and a little slice and dice made for a fun to watch horror movie."
5,A very valuable resource,Thx so much for the information to help reduce the growing epidemic of child maltreatment!
3,"great in theory, but reality's a little different","while i think a book like this is definitely needed, this one is not it. i want a book that provides me with examples, anecdotes, exercises, etc. i also don't want a book that advocates the boy scouts as a good resource - the homophobia of the boyscouts is something i'll avoid.nope, if you want a great glbt parenting book (and i've read them all), get the queer parent's primer, by stephanie brill"
5,Best Book for Punch Needle Rug Hooking,"I believe this is THE book for learning how to use a punch needle to make rugs and one of the few on this subject. (Most books in this genre are on latch hooking or punch needle embroidery, but not punch needle rug hooking.) I built a frame from the instructions in this book and I am not that handy with building things. Gloria Crouse's design - although it does smack of the 60's - and use of materials was and is absolutely groundbreaking relative to the traditional/primitive style and design of rug making. She developed techniques and used materials that had never been used before. Thank you Gloria!"
2,Not what I expected,"This book is mostly about making wall hangings and is not a good book for the beginner or anyone looking for information about the type of rugs you would put on the floor. I was hoping for some good examples of alternate materials for interesting looks, but this book fell short of that. If you are looking for a fantastic book on this subject look at ""The Rug Hook Book"" by Thom Boswell, it covers it all from where to get supplies, choosing fabrics (with lots of ideas for adding fun and unusual materials for texture and color), great patterns from traditional to modern. I just can't say enough. If you only buy one book.....this should be the one....it has it all!!!"
5,Couldn't Put it Down!,"How Chris's personal adversity is entwined in the six strategies is incredible! I wish every HR Department would give this book to every employee. I'm going to order seven; one for my middle-school daughter, 3 brothers, 2 sisters, and an extra one to have to give to anyone who whines about something .. I'll hand it to him/her and say, ""Take this and read it; tell me how you feel after you're finished"". Personal, business, young, old ... it's an inspiration to all who read!"
1,It's the WRONG DVD!!!,"I ordered this and it's a flick about Moose Hunting in Canada... the only simularity to the 60's t.v. series is the title! I'll keep checking back but as long as it's a ""Stoney-Wolf Productions"" product, it is NOT the movie you're looking for."
4,A must see video for all Hulkamaniacs,"I thought this was a very good video for all Hulk Hogan fans, a must see. Hall OF Fame collecter series includes rare matches from Hogan's early WWE career. Versus King Kong Bundy in a steel cage was excellent match. Other great matches on this video, vintage hulkamania. For all who enjoy the old school wrestling, or simply are a hulkamaniac, I definitely recommend this video."
3,Over all Hulkamania is still the most powerful force,"This video was very entertaining. Hulk Hogan at his best. I am the biggest fan of the Hulkster, this video showed some of his early stuff against the then WWF's top stars. I think it is deffenetly worth the investment, just to see those 24inch arms one more time is mind boggleing. The only bad side to this movie is the picture quality. It is not totally clear at times,but you can still make out Hulks ever popular pump ups. If you enjoyed Hulkamania and would like to revisit it give it a try. See how Hulk Hogan truly made wresling what it is today."
5,This video is very good,I liked this video because it showed Hogan in his early WWF days. A must see for Hogan fans.
5,third day,hey if you love third days music you will love third daysofferings dvd experience its lots of foddege and deleted seensand much more so you will enjoy this dvd as well as i did todaybe sure look amazon .com be cuse third day will reless anotherdvd calld third day com together it will be relessd april 1st2003 and downt for get third day will be playing a concerton may 10th at the arowhead pond of anahime ticket are 30dollersget the tickets at the pond thanks mike
5,TOTALLY AWESOME DVD!,"I became a fan of Third Day last year after someone gave me their copy of the first ""Offerings"" CD and I was immediatley hooked on the bands music! When I watched this DVD for the first time, I was absolutely blown away by the band's heart for worshipping God. These guys don't just put on an act, they are the real deal! My favorite songs off of the DVD are as follows:""Took My Place""-A good song to get the crowd moving and excited!""I've Always Loved You""-A song that tells us that even though we may stumble and fall, God still loves us and always will!""My Hope Is You""-The testimony that Mac Powell gives during this song will want to make you shout!All in all, you will not be disappointed with this DVD--GO BUY IT NOW!"
3,What the 5 star reviews don't tell you,"Chances are if you are interested in buying this, you already are familiar with the music, so I won't comment on that aspect. While the video editing is good, it's not very sharp (very pixelated). Poor film quality I suppose. It's not unwatchable by any means, it's just not great. The sound is not that great either, bass heavy and slightly muddy."
3,High energy,"The concert displayed a high energy level with good musicianship. The vocals were difficult to understand, however, if you are familiar with Third Day that may not be too distracting. While this displays some of the spiritual delights you will encounter at a Third Day concert, if you really want to experience the music I would suggest their studio albums....."
2,I goofed!,"This is NOT the original 12 chapter serial but rather a condensed version. By ""condensed"", I'm telling you that this three hour serial has been put into a 61 minute feature. As such, it is quite disappointing to serial collectors as myself. I am referring to the Timeless Video release here."
1,Just plain bad....,"I thought this book was stupidly optimistic, at best. Now that there have been a couple of years to test ""Dr."" Rosensweig's theories, it proves to be as flawed and ignorant as originally thought. Not worth the paper it is printed on."
1,Unbridled Optimism vs. Reality,"Time has shown the theories in this book to be flat out wrong. There is a difference between being an optimist and a realist. The optimism in this book ignores reality, implying that third-world countries can participate in the global economy without the years and dollars it will take to build crucial infrastructures, while ignoring the fact that there is competition of other more-advanced countries with the same cheap labor and less inherent risk. There is no hard-core / hard-hitting analysis, just a little number crunching, some remedial graphs, and unfounded theories. The best advice is to save your [money] and not buy this book."
2,Odo on his own - alone!,"The first season of DS9 featured several episodes dedicated to each specific character, this one went to Odo. It's slow, boring and solid - the exact opposite of the Odo we love and adore."
2,Also not thrilled!,Purchased two that I will be returning. They do not fit well and would definitely blow off in a breeze. Seller also charges double the listed price for shipping.
2,Works well (for awhile),"Purchased this grill about a year ago. It worked well, however seemed to always be to hot. It cooked veges/burgers pretty well, but it is bulky, drips grease out the back, and the top leveling mechanism broke after a few months. Due to the overheating, the non-stick began to burn after about 6 months. In trying to contact Brevelle for a warranty replacement, well, get ready to WAIT.....I've still not been able to talk to a human being. I would not recommend this unit due to faulty manufacturing and poor customer service."
3,Nice looking but think twice...,"Bought this grill about 2 years, worked great, even cooking and the stainless steel looked nice in my kitchen. However just last week, the grill will no longer turn on? I can't say I used this grill heavily by any means, maybe a few times a month to cook a steak or some sausages, so I'm a little puzzled as to what the problem is. I took a look at Breville's support site and found that this problem is not uncommon! (Hence my 'think twice' title...;)) The 1 year warranty is long gone, so the best I can hope for is to either fix this myself (which I can only guess what the problem might be) or try and get it serviced locally, at additional cost to me.Really kind of disappointed in this, thought paying a few extra bucks would get me a good solid grill...guess I was just paying for the looks..."
3,Breville Indoor BBQ,"Breville really does make some good stuff but I am mixed on this one. I like it but it is a little bulkier than expected. If that I not an issue, this works pretty well for getting things cooked right from freezer to plate. I have done the basic steaks, chicken, burgers, and eggs with this. In my opinion, I would always choose to go outside and cook on the outdoor grill but this unit is fine if your staying out of the rain. It is probably best used for bacon and egg type meals of a grilled cheese sandwich. The newer one has upgraded controls (digital) which is probably a nice touch. Mine has its place and works fine. Just be sure you have a place to store it or get the smaller one."
4,Grilling indoors,We have previously purchased the panini press from Breville. That is perfect in combination with an outdoor grill. We are now in an area that won't allow outdoor grills. The indoor grill while bulky if you live in a small space does a wonderful job and gives that like-outdoor taste. The ability to open grill or griddle hasn't been tried (space limitations) but will come in handy in the future. Clean-up is a bit cumbersome.
5,"big, but grand...","i love my grill. it is big, heavy and awkward, but if you want even heat and grilling, you want a big grill surface. the smaller grills are convenient, but cook unevenly. i've read some of the negative reviews and have had no problems with the grill working or nonstick plate being flawed. my only compliant is with the cookbook. i found the recipes nonappealing and there were not very many recipes either. the grill is extremely easy to clean, though the plates are not removable. there is another model in which they are. overall, this is the cadillac of grills. just buy another cookbook to go along with it."
1,Piece of Junk,"This is a poorly made grill. My unit worked about 5 times before it stopped powering on altogether. Breville ""customer service"" is a joke. For the money, it is truly astounding how badly made this item is. Be aware that Breville has a minimal presence in the U.S. and hardly anyone in the U.S. will service a Breville product."
3,I Love this item for cooking - Although this is too large and bulky,I have this sitting on my counter however if your cabinets are low it is hard to open it withoutsliding it off the counter a little. It cleans up well. I wish it had removable grids to clean.Would like one a little smaller to get around better.
4,Really Touching,"This book is a collection of short stories about Mexican-American teens in California, but the themes and the things they do could apply to anyone. Reading this book, you watch their transition into adulthood, the loss of innocence and the pain that comes with it. The stories are all very different. There is the story of a girl who tries to buy back all the clothes of her mother's her father gave away when her mother died. There is the story of a hardworking, honest boy, and his cousin, who flees when the going gets rough, but comes back for the glory. But all the stories weave a complicated picture that will leave you sighing wistfully at the end."
4,Refund on product,Upon receiving the item. It did not work. Refund was given quickly. My rating is based on how well the issues were addressed.

1,Should Have Stayed Forgotten,"I am writing this review because I was misled into buying this DVD based on the one review below. I cannot imagine why anyone would recommend these movies.The quality of film and sound is so bad that they are almost impossible at times to hear and it is tedious trying to adjust the right colors. BUT...the movies themselves are AWFUL, the acting is dreadful, and the plotlines are transparent.These are among the worst TV movies ever shown. If they are ""rare"" it is because nobody ever thought they could show them on TV or in public again, until this blessed medium of DVD became available and marketeers realized even Eskimos could be persuaded to buy ice with the right packaging."
3,Only First Movie is Good,"I only enjoyed the first movie. If you are not a lover of old films, this may be of interest to see the 70s trends of whodunnits. If you are interested in seeing current stars in their early years, this DVD is for you."
1,Poor quality,"This set was a diapoiment, all the way around. I would not recomend these remakes to anyone."
5,Gripping,"I live in Tokyo and I found this novel's description of the city extremely evocative. There are some extraordinarily lyrical passages, but this is no pompous snoozefest. It is a really compelling thriller. I zipped through it in about a week."
5,This album ROCKS!!!,"T.H. White is a musical genius! This is a perfect concept album of original grooves and sounds. The album is kickin' from start to finish. I hope T.H. White continues to produce with this kind of creativity. ""More Than Before"" takes you on a journey back to the 70's while keeping it tight with a fresh, ultramodern funkified vibe."
4,"Cool, well-crafted, and mature.","Highly recommended. Not entirely unlike K.C. and the Sunshine Band of the late '70's Disco era, neither of which I much liked. Kind of soft, rockish instrumentals with maybe jazz and disco influences, with a variety of backing vocalists. No hit singles, just a solid, solid album. Precision playing of well-crafted songs, I feel more mature for having listened to it. Mood music perfect for an adult mixer, especially when nobody is familiar with it. Dancible enough to encourage it when that party is on fire, but no so much that you notice it most of the time. Encore, Mr. White!!(P.S. - it doesn't hurt to have extra copies on hand for guests who might express an interest.)"
5,Recuperar el corazon,"Desearía comprar el libro recuperar el corázón del DR Dean Ornish, por favor me gustaría saber si el libro que venden en esta página web es el traducido al español, si es así díganmelo para comprarlo, muchas gracias.Saludos.María.I want to buy Recuperar el corazon(DR Dean Ornish), but i need to know if the book on this web has the spanish traduction.Thanks a lot, María."
2,"[Two and a half stars] Not as good as the sequel, w/ Carradine and complitists Welles and Socas!","Actually, the lovely Maria Socas did TheWarrior and the Sorceress w/ Carradine(topless!) in 1984, one-and-a-half yrs.,before this came out. Welles redid hisrole with Carradine in 1989. The '89version with Bobby Jacoby, Sid Haig,et, al is better. These movies inspiredthe Harry Pothead Series. I wouldn'trecommend these for kids, but it's harm-less adults. Carradine reprises his 'DarkOne/Kaine' role from Wizards of the Lostkingdom here, instead of the Svenson cha-racter of the W.O.t.L.K. role of the first1985 film, an improvement, even if he waswearing a wig!"
5,"Excellent, and a Solution for the Side Sleeping Problem","I have oddly shaped ear canals and none of the foam earplugs ever stayed in for me. These fit perfectly and stayed in all night. They do an excellent job blocking noise, and as far as I can see, will last forever if you clean them often.The last commentator made an excellent point - the only problem I encountered with these ear plugs is that when you sleep on your side, they jam uncomfortably into your ear because they stick out. An easy solution for side sleepers is to take out the removable string permanently, and chop of the little yellow holders from the plugs with scissors. You will be able to put the plugs in and remove them."
5,"Great for Studying, Reading, Vacuuming, Mowing...","I use these things for everything but swimming (see title). They really provide a tight, yet comfortable, seal in your ear canal. Cord is easily removable.They last for about a year of heavy use. Then the ""flaps"" start to weaken/flatten, and you no longer get a tight, firm seal. Easy to clean."
2,Are they supposed to block out noise?,"I bought these ear plugs to block out noise while studying. Honestly, I can't even tell a difference with them in my ears. Everything seems to be at exactly the same volume as before I put the plugs in. If you want these to reduce ambient noise, I would definitely recommend getting something else, as these do nothing for. I didn't buy them to use in the pool or anything like that so I can't comment on how well they seal. I gave them two stars because all though they don't block out any noise, they are extremely comfortable and easy to put in and take out (I think I have average size ear canals) so they may still be useful if you plan on using them in the pool."
1,not good,helloI recently received my earplugs and I started using. I need you to swim yet I always run the water enters the ear and are uncomfortable. Talves work to avoid the sound but definitely not going well for swimming.
2,Mack's Ear Seals Review,"They did not work for me. I read the instructions, pulled my ears back, twisted the plugs in in a slow motion etc. Yet could never form the ""SEAL""Water got into my ear like crazy. I gave the product 2 stars, because it came in a neat container that I use with other type of earplugs after discarding Mack's."
5,great!,These are great earplugs! Once you have them in place it sounds just like if you were plugging your ears with your fingers. I use them so i can get sleep in the dorms!
3,"Works great, when they stay in","I would have rated these higher, but i have difficulty getting to into place and staying in place as i move around. When in they are in place, the level of noise reduction is great, but the effort needed for me to get them in and comfortable if not worth the pain i feel."
3,Decent Ear Plugs,"These are decent ear plugs for noise reduction, but they're not the quietest or the most comfortable. I haven't used these for swimming, so I can't comment on their water-proof abilities. For about the same price, I strongly prefer the Hearos Water Protection Series (blue flexible rubber) ear plugs (not the foam ones). The Hearos are easy to insert/remove, conform easily to my ears, block out the most sound of any non-foam ear plug I've tried, and are the most comfortable ear plugs I've ever tried. I almost always carry a pair of the blue flexible rubber Hearos ear plugs in my pockets. I did a back-to-back comparison of the Hearos Water Protection Series against the Mack's Ear Seals in a noisy room. The Hearos fit both of my ears better and blocked out significantly more noise."
5,Love them!,"These earplugs were exactly what I'm looking for! Although the surrounding sound around you doesn't vanish completely, it will feel like the ""volume was turned down"" quite significantly. Great for studying. Even better is the price. :D"
3,The Mormons - a very special story...,"I purchased my copy of ""The Mormons"" in 2009 and prepared a fairly elaborate viewing guide, and later did quite a bit of reading on the LDS church, so when I recently viewed the program with a adult religious study group I was somewhat surprsed by the bias that was quite evident in the remarks by several of the historians featured on the program, especially Ken Verdoia.A great effort was obviousily made by PBS to present a balanced, non-judgmental, view of LDS church history; but the bottom line is the LDS church is masquerading as a religious faith, when it actually is a thriving business, effectively practicing religious brainwashing.Sadly, it hasn't changed since it was fraudulently concocted by Joseph Smith in 1830.This PBS classic is a good place to begin your study of Mormonism."
2,An incomplete story,This was an interesting film of what non-mormons think the Mormons believe. A majority of the film was spent interviewing those who were either not members or those that had left the church. A disproportionate time was also spent on contraversial issues that were an unfortunate but a small part of Mormon history. Most of the actual beliefs and practices of the church are not included in this film.
1,HORRIBLE!!,"Bad, boring, and deffinitely not accurate. If you want a false representation of the mormon chuch, this is just the video for you. I was very disappointed in PBS and I'm questioning the accuracy of their other programs in which I know little about."
2,Tropical Sea Shower Curtain,"Tropical Sea Shower Curtain is not as pretty as it was on the computer. The colors look bright and cheery online but when I hung it up at home, it looks dull and cheap. I hope that helps."
5,THE Classic in DnB,This was and still is the best example of the diversity within the Jungle scene. It has the best mix of everything that anyone could want. It has the unique ability to make you dance and/or calm you down... whichever you need at the moment... I have to say that this is a MUST BUY for anyone interested in the roots of Jungle...
5,Even if you don't like drum & bass...,"get this cd. One of the best dj sets I've ever heard, and I usually listen to house, trance... etc."
5,Hyperspace is a 10+,"Easy to understand. Keeps you interested through the entire movie. Up to date with all new stuff like ""String Theory"". I also own some of the other DVDs from NOVA and Hawkins etc and all are very good. Hyperspace is as good or even better than those. Buy it you will love it!"
5,for folks not to full of themselves,"this was very good for folks who wish to be entertained,and learn at the same time.If your a prof. or doc. or someone who thinks to highly of yourself, you will not like this or anything else.If you are the other 99 percent of us you will enjoy this."
5,This is the DVD for the deserted island scenario,"Totally mesmerized, I watched this in one sitting. The CGI is totally incredible. The interviews and information so extremely interesting and well spoken, that it's heartwarming. ASTONISHING if you like space documentaries. Also the most informative one I've ever seen. It really was from the beginning to the end of the universe (or at least what we know of it).There are dozens of stories that get more incredible than the last. If you have a 16X9 tele, your going to have a field day with this disc, it's the kind that I'm sure you will see vendors using to sell TV's. Gorgeous and engrossing. This is my favorite disc to date."
1,Great for 6th Graders,This is great stuff for the folks who have been living in caves for the last 10-15 years. Absolutely nothing new here.
4,"Great Content, Narration, Graphics... So-So DVD Transfer","Sorry but this DVD could have been perfect, but isnt. You'd think with the genius behind the series would have thought that out."
2,I'm sorry I bought it.,"Actually, I hate this hair dryer. It has two settings - and the first one is way, way, too hot, and the second setting is too low. Also, it dries the top of my hair, but not the sides and back. Even after a half hour, the sides are still very wet. I purchased it because I thought the name Vidal Sassoon would mean quality.I have been using home driers for over 25 years, and this is the absolute worst I have ever owned."
2,Want my money back,This dryer is not worth $30. The bonnet keeps falling down because the locking mecanism is very cheap. All plastic parts. I will be purchasing a new dryer shortly.
2,This time the mix of comedy and martial action doesn't work,"I think the title says it all. There was too much going on. The potential was great. Gordon Liu not being cast as the hero was a brilliant move, but it could not make up for all the wrong elements and attempts at soap opera and comedy. Some very good action sequences in here though especially the attack on the Uncle's laundry business."
1,Facades,"Inarguably pretentious.The Red Paintings, or Red Pastiches, are not in the least bit as innovative as so often self-promoted.Their explicit use of art to attempt to elevate some Blink182 with strings attached tripe is trite, an insult to actual innovation, wherein structure and technique should be ingenious."
1,el decor Italia,"It is hard to review a magazine that I have yet to receive even though it was order 12/04/2005. Please let me know when I can expect to receive my 1st issue,"
1,Unfortunately you'll never get what you pay for,"I had the same problem as the other reviewers. Six months passed after I had ordered until I finally received my first issue. Then three months went by and two came at the same time. Not quite sure what is up with the mailing service, but I ended up canceling. It's easier and less of a headache just to get them from the bookstore. Too bad because this is the best interiors mag around."
4,Swiss Gear Sleeping Bag,"This is the Cheapest and a very good quality sleeping bag which is reliable at low temperatures (0 degree sleeping bag).Only downside is the weight, 5-6 pounds, but that is compensated by superior product quality."
1,Very disappointing,"I'll fess up: I'm not a big fan of Star Trek novelizations, but I figured I'll give this one a try because I love old SF, Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, Commander Cody, etc. Wow, did I figure wrong!If this book where any slower, it would have been arrested for blocking traffic. Those old serials were renowned for their frantic pace, which this book comes nowhere near.Further, the author doesn't seem to be sure whether he is doing a hommage to the old serials or a satire. Doesn't really matter, though, because by the time you've noticed the inconsistency, you'll have given up reading this...book."
3,Overpriced but cute.,"Printed in two-column style, little this book is packed full of goofy but fun references to Destructo Beams and Imagizers, Giant Trundle Spiders and Beings Not From This Universe. And, of course, Constance Goodheart's very good screams.I was disappointed in the photographs, taken as they were from Voyager's only Proton episodes, ""Night,"" and ""Bride of Chaotica!"" and used over and over (all at least twice and several more times than that).But if you're looking for a harmless bit of sci-fi fluff and don't mind the $$ for it this one's for you. Me? I got mine with a gift certificate!"
3,Super Reader,"This is a spoof based on a holodeck game that Harry Kim and Tom Parris played, by the looks. The hero is a Captain Future style hero, without the more than human sidekicks, just a reporter.The book is done to be a facsimile style pulp novel, with the same style for the table of contents, shorts, letters to the editor, backup features that are to be continued, etc. All spoofing as well. Quite well done for what they have have meant to do.The writing, much like in Randall Garrett's Back Stage Lensman, is deliberately bad or incongruous.""Now it was a One-Bug-Eyed-Monster! An O.B.E.M.""""It is amazing to me,"" Proton observed. ""How far evil can fall when pushed slightly.""There are other similar literary gems to be had throughout the book.Quite likely to amuse."
2,A Real Letdown,"The Captain Proton episode was one of those rare things for Star Trek Voyager: a truly good episode. I picked up this book because it looked like an amusing hack. In part it is, but there is a big problem: the writing. The book would have been quite humorous had Smith written it deadpan, trying to mimic the style of the time. Instead, he tried to be over-the-top humorous, and this just didn't work as well. It was just flat and trite."
3,OK but Pictures Not Included,"This is probably a good example of the type of book Captain Proton was based on, but if you are expecting any reference to Voyager, Tom or Harry, you won't find it. I at least would have liked for the pictures of Tom and Harry that were in the paperback to be included but they weren't."
1,Full of himself.,"Nice story, but alot of truth and deception by the author was left out. May his ego shine."
4,Highly recommended,"Siri Hustvedt is such a beautiful and evocative writer. (Her first novel, The Blindfold, had a huge impact on me). This is a collection of 12 essays written from 1995 to 2004. I love the way she seamlessly weaves imagination with reality - for me there is exhilaration at discovering someone who captures the inner world so well (or at least mine!) My favorite essays were ""Being A Man"", ""9/11 or One Year Later"" and ""Notes on a Wounded Self."" I didn't enjoy her literary criticism as much, finding it a bit dry - I think she is best when she sticks to the personal. All in all, I'd highly recommend this book."
5,Brings Back Childhood Memories,I had seen these movies as a kid some as first run and others as repeats on late night TV. Quirky? Yes but still worth the money and entertainment value!
4,Fire Movie,Pretty good choice. I'm not into it that much but I think the person I got it for liked it! I'm not much help w/ this one!
3,Bad Service,"I placed this order on Oct 8th for a mission trip to leave on Oct 20th. When I placed the order, it was to receive by standard shipping within 6 days. After the order was placed, it was not shipped for several days. I did not receive this by Oct 20th. Do not order and expect to receive within 2 weeks. This is bad service."
2,Annik Goutal Passion- Not So Good,"I am really puzzled as to why most of the reviews I have read on this perfume were raves. I purchased it online because I have a huge perfume collecton, I LOVE perfume and wanted to try something different and this seemed to be the one that got very good reviews and I also liked the described scent. That being said this stuff reeks. It reminds me of old perfume that's been left in a drawer for years...almost like a cheap perfume people used to wear in high school......I want to return it because it smells so horrible. I would not recommend it."
1,Great but died after a year,"I loved this juicer and used it just about every day. It's very solidly build and extracts juice quite well. However, after about a year exactly, it died on me and no longer spins. There is apparently a defect with the plastic piece on the base that turns the citrus part. I'm waiting to hear back from Breville about repair or replacement but all of the reviews on the Breville site say the same thing and also note that it's expensive to mail and replace. I can believe that because the unit itself is pretty bulky."
2,beware of plastic gearing in the motor,"The exterior is all shiny and stainless steel, but the motor in this thing has plastic gearing, and those plastic gears wear out and don't last. I have read here reviews from lots of people happy that they get ~2 years of use out of this unit before it breaks and happily go on and buy another, but I am not part of that fan club. One can't be faulted for thinking that Breville could use something better than $0.10 plastic gears to power this thing."
5,The best,"It is the best citrus juicer for the money. Solid build, efficient and easy to clean. I have been using one for about 6 years, several times a week. The routine is simple: juice and toss it into dishwasher. It is so simple that it doesn't matter if I juice one lemon, or make a gallon of juice. It includes 2 strainers for little or no pulp."
4,Awsome performance but pricey like breville.,"I would give it 4.5 but there is no way to do so. Only reason I would take the half star is for its price.If you can afford that price and you like orange juice you MUST have this. I don't like store bought OJ so this was a must for me. Every thing is good, performance, clean up etc.Every now and then I throw the plates etc in dishwasher. No problem at all. Initially I had difficulty putting up the upper cone. but now I have got the hang of it. Sits on my counter top with no difficulty. I like the dust cap feature as well. I also like the drip stop feature of the spout. I have it for almost a year now. I use it 2-3 times a week.Some people don't like the size of it but I don't care. I am more than happy if the device performs well and if cleaning and maintenance is not big of a deal. I like the ease of it. Cut oranges in 1/2 ..juicing takes less than a min for a glass..and cleaning takes about 2-3 mins."
5,Best Juicer I've Ever had,"I have read some reviews about this product breaking down. I've had mine for about 3 months and no problems. My fingers are crossed. BUT.........this juicer is the best I've ever had. I always bought the $20-40 juicers in the past. They never broke, but you're always squeezing the orange with your hand and moving it around and sometimes it stops because there isn't enough power. Sometimes the base moves around. This one, you just pull the handle in one quick movement and done, its really fast, the base never moves, the power is always there. It's really worth the money."
4,Breville 800CPXL Citrus Press,"The press works pretty good and I like it. However, they need to re-design the cup which is attached to the handle and goes on top of the fruit, it does not hold to the handle well and keeps coming off. Die Cast Citrus Press"
4,Orange Juice Squeezer- Squeeze Me Until I'm Orange,"This orange juice squeezer is a strong, reliable piece of equipment from one of the top companies which makes dentures and eye-glass holders in America. Can be used throughout the day to squeeze oranges, apples, and moist hog skin; it might look like something out of a Sci-Fi film but it sure does the job! Look for the free, 2 years supply of melons contest included with the ""how to hook up to your refrigerator"" instructions."
1,Not a safe product,"Opened it, did not like what I saw, it has many parts, and some have sharp edges. I just returned it, did not even try to use it. So, it may not be fair for one star rating. I did not care for it though."
3,Warning: Made in Red China,"It's a good product, but it's a bit worrisome that it's made in China. I can't help, but think if there is lead or other contaminents that get in my OJ daily. Scary thought. If it was made in the US then I wouldn't worry about that."
1,Late,"Why do they take so long to send, should have in stock when purchase it. They are like old days when take 6 weeks to get your order. Not order rom them again"
5,The best Citrus Press on the Market,Great Juicer. My family is very health conscious. We have owned and tried several brands including Juicers that are much more costly. Easy to clean and very fast. I don't have the time to waste on long clean ups and messy kitchens. Breville has designed an outstanding product. I would buy this juicer any time again and have recommended it to many friends and family. I have owned our juicer over 2 years and it runs like on the first day. We juice every day and sometimes even twice a day. No other juicer comes close to it. If you have questions you can give me a call: 501-779-2273
4,Breville Citrus Press,Excellent purchase. Powerful motor makes juicing large quantity of oranges a snap. Easy to clean up following juicing.Great improvement over previous juicers owned - not Breville. Those were slower and hence juicing was avoided or was a chore.
5,Great,I have only juiced a 100 lemons. What I like is the strength of the motor and heavy duty nature of this machine.
5,It's a babe,"From 2 years ago till now I've bought 5 each of Breville Citrus Juicer for myself, my daughter & my friends.Easy to use, efficient, reliable & beautiful as a kitchen appliance are some features of this product. Every morning I have date with her to supply us with 3 glasses of fresh orange juice."
5,Fabulous Citrus Juicer,"So far it has exceeded my already high expectations. Everything I try to juice works. And it is almost totally effortless. I've had it two months, and we have a small citrus orchard with all sizes of fruit. So, it has had a lot of use. I just hope it lasts and lasts and lasts...."
5,Incomparable citrus juicer--a must for health,"Now I have fresh juice all the time. No more bottled lemon, orange or grapefruit juice. Fresh lime juice for guacamole! Yum! --What a difference it makes in the flavors of your salad dressings and meals. Easy to clean and assemble, I never hesitate to use it. All stainless steel parts makes this a superior machine. Safe for children and elderly to operate. Looks beautiful on my counter. Plastic cover plate keeps it clean all the time. One of my favs. I just love it!"
1,Dome kept falling out/finally broke off - after only 1 month,"We loved this juicer when we purchased it. However, the plastic part of the fruit dome constantly became separated from the metal part. After about one month, it just broke off. Now, it is impossible to replace - and expensive ($30-$33). Very disappointing. I went out and bought a $14.99 juicer and if it breaks, I can throw it away and buy another. Very disappointed."
1,Not so fast with this purchase.....,"First, I had no problem with Amazon, they shipped when they said... If you drink a lot of juice, and you like Pulp. This is NOT the juicer for you.Pros:1. Sturdy construction.2. Handle is easy to use.Cons:1. A standard glass (not the small juice glass) will not fit under the pour spout, without putting the juicer on a book, or raising it somehow.2. To clean the top, you need to push down firmly on the exact center of the button, because a variation of this and your thumb or finger, with scrape against the edge of the handle (and it has sharp edges), also to put it back is a bit tricky.3. The course (not fine) strainer doesn't let any pulp through at all. Nothing for Oranges, and nothing for Lemons.Wash:Cleaning was easy. But, there is a lot of surface area to clean up (4 items), compared to the crank juicers (3 items)"
1,"paint on the ""aluminum"" blade part coming off",The words: (Breville 800CPXL Die-Cast Stainless-Steel Motorized Citrus Press) are deceiving. The blade part where the very acid citrus is being pressed against is painted shinny stainless steel. Well this eventually comes off and probably into the juice; underneath is the aluminum. The information that the blades are mostly aluminum is given in fine print somewhere else then the title. After reading the fine print I see that it is aluminum but not until after using it for a year or two and then noticed the paint coming off very easily while washing it. I would have otherwise given it a rate of five. I have to warn people who may be trying to detox from a chronic illness that this is not the juicer to get. We are trying to get the chemicals out not put them in.
1,Not a durable product,"This juicer's motor broke down in less than two years with only mild use. For its price, one would expect a higher quality product."
4,Breville Citrus Press works well,I bought this citrus press about a month ago and I really enjoy it. It works well. It juices the oranges really quickly. Minimal mess. The pieces go in the dishwasher quite easily.
5,It is worthy,"I have three times only to use the product since I have bought it, and I find it is really good as I used to imagine. So far so good!The product is designed so smart and well used,as well as the technics. It is very easy when you operate this one, simply and fast. The item is solid,could be last long time. Every part of the item is designed reasonable to your use. And the item is well packaged during the shipping.It cost me 210$(including ship fees),and it is worthy."
1,"bad, bad","I bought this for my restaurant, it was broken after only two days. It created so much headach for me, I dont why people write good review about it. I am highly unsatisfied."
5,What a Dream!,"This juicer is the best citrus juicer I've ever used. It's quiet, smooth, and efficient. Easy to use and to clean. Looks to built to last for many years. This may be the last citrus juicer that you'll ever have to buy. I highly recommend this product.Breville 800CPXL Die-Cast Stainless-Steel Motorized Citrus Press"
2,Pretty Good for a While,"I thought this citrus juicer was very good when I got it in July of 2007. It is nicely finished in easy-to-clean stainless-steel, the lever action makes it less of a strain to get some pressure on the citrus, and it is fairly easy to clean the parts.I make about 1/2 - 1 cup of juice daily. After a couple of months, something bent or stretched or broke in the hinge mechanism, and it became a little loose. Everything kept working though.Well, the six month mark came yesteday, and it died. I juiced half of a lime, and when I put the other half in... nothing. I guess the internal switch that activates the motor when one depresses the lever failed.For $160, I would have hoped that it make to the one year mark. Who knows, maybe I can get it repaired or replaced, but I can no longer recommend this juicer without reservations."
3,Breville problem,"It is a beautiful product but after a year of making juice daily for three adults it start skipping the rotor, I open it and find out that the gears were worn out so I tried to get them and after 8 months that I order them and payed I received them and changed the parts, but guess what the motor still skipping so I suppose is the motor which worth about a $100.00 , if Breville could fix this situation this would be a great product because it is really nice and practic to clean."
5,Excellent!!!!,"Product arrived on time, very well protected, no damage during shipping. After testing it with navel oranges and grapefruits for more than a month now we are super happy and satisfied with this most excellent product! Well done Breville!!!"
1,"At first loved it, then...","I never post reviews however I'm so tired of buying products and spending extra money thinking your going to get what you paid for however this item although it worked great in the beginning, the plastic eject button broke and now the juicer is useless! To old to return but this thing lasted less than a year!They just don't make things like they used to! So bummed"
4,"Powerful motor, doesn't stall","My be too soon to review, but, good quality, quiet, easy to clean. The top cup attached to the handle that holds the fruit comes off too easy, it takes a bit of getting used to.. the 'c' washer that holds the cup onto the handle is weak. Occasionally I spread the washer out, then the cup holds on ok."
5,This item should be a model for a design school,This is one of the most satisfying purchases ever. The design is so well thought out that I think it should be used as an example design in schools. The construction is sturdy and the attention to detail is amazing.
5,WOW Great Book,If you love Ruger firearms this is a book to buy. It shows the wonderful rich history of the Sturm Ruger Company. There are hundreds of great pictures and very valuable information.
4,Ruger and his guns,"Excellent content, though the text format is a little confusing. Very informative read about Ruger, his guns, and his company."
2,Bad binding,"This is the 2nd book I ordered. The first one fell apart but I really liked the book itself, so I ordered a new one. I did not return it or get a refund on either book. This one was delivered and right out of the package, it is completely out of the binding. The replacement took longer to get, which Amazon was really good about letting me know when it would come, but I am not going to try for a 3rd one. Will just try to fix this one myself."
1,Perhaps the poorest laid out book I have ever read!!!!,"With thousands of books behind me, this is the poorest laid out book I have ever tried to read. The side bars are interspersed with the text in such a manner that you can not tell where one stops and the next begins; then there are little asides that also break of the continuity of the narrative... I will buy no more of the Wilson books..."
4,Buy the full length Labour of Love II album from England,"I gave this one a 4 because its great, but IT'S MISSING 4 TRACKS which are one of the best on the album. You can't get them on the American release. It's worth paying more to get the import Labour of Love II. Look under IMPORTS."
5,phillysoulbrother on UB40 reggae covers,"brilliant compilation of reggae covers by UK(birmingham based) band - BRILLIANT!!!!!!!Have vinyl LP already - must for ALL UB40 fansSinger man, kingston girl, wear you to the ball, here i am & tears from my eyes are MEGA+++++++++++++++++++ - get it now"
2,... really disappointed this time ...,"I have recently ordered several books from Amazon.com ... I usually order books used and found that they are in really good shape .. until I ordered Bay/Sky! The description said it was ""used/good"" ...however, this book is warped, as if it had been stored somewhere with a heavy object on top of it. I was hoping to display this book in my house, but I won't be able to ... it just looks bad. The pages are fine."
2,been there done that,"Too long, too convoluted,too depressing! Based on a true story?? No wonder we can never have ""world peace"". No one to root for because all of these guys are evil & ""deserve"" to die. Only refreshing thing for me.........the scumbags are mostly from British military/secret/whatever organizations instead of American ones. Stopped caring about an hour in & was just glad they didn;t let the girl get killed. A Romance story wedged into all of the violent soul-less mercenary killing??! Why bother?! Great cast & they can act but they should have skipped this one. Me too!"
3,"good action, better bcs it's based on a real story","I don't think this is a great flick, but it is ok for an action flick, and well worth the $2 standard definition rental. So I wouldn't pay much but $2 is worth it."
3,good movie,Robert dinero is one of my favorite actors that's mainly the only reason i rented it i thought he was going to come out more i was somewhat dissapointed there wasent very much action but yea i rate this movie 3 starz.
2,"Ok movie, nothing great.","The action was alright bu there never is a real reason to root for the assassins, in fact I wanted Clive Owen's character to kill them all. De Niro really didn't do much and Statham's character was unlikeable, as before the only character worth anything is Owen who is probably the only male that isn't a douche bag."
2,Choppy,"It just. Didn't have a food flow to it. It wasn't a complete waste of time but close. Not well written or directed and the acting was only so,so."
4,Killer Elite,"This was a great movie, it arrived in plenty of time, and was in great shape, I would recommend this sell to others."
2,Stinker movie with a great cast,"I thought this would be a great action movie, but it put me to sleep. The plot was too convoluted and boring."
2,Not recommended unless you are a big Stratham fan,DeNiro was terrible. He is supposed to be a professional killer yet he acts like a worried mother throughout the film. Not a believable role.
2,Could Have Been Great,"Once you decipher the story of ""Killer Elite,"" you realize that it's so, so interesting and good. A better story than the ""Bourne Idnetity"" or James Bond movies. To save his friend, a hard-ass mercenary has to revisit the bad deeds of a group of British commandos and set things right. Against him is an equally tough commando who wants to stop him. For much of the movie, both men see each other as the bad guy, which gives them great motivation to win. Jason Statham is always great when he has a good story and Clive Owen should be awesome here, too. But, the story is told with cliche after cliche and the directing is so bad that you wish you'd just read the book. The opening scene with De Niro is the best I've seen him in since ""Ronin,"" though, and I thought it would be the big De Niro tough guy comeback. Then, he just whines the rest of the movie."
2,Mediocre. and very long,"That pretty much covers it. Cut out around 45 mins and it could be more entertaining. As is, I started looking at the clock about 1.5 hrs in."
3,Good to watch on a plane ride,I'm pretty sure I would have been disappointed had I paid full price at the movie but it was entertaining enough to pass the time on a plane.
3,Okay for a one time watch,"Okay for a one time watch, good action on Jason's part but it leaves room more acting for sure. Okay to watch but would not be one that I would keep in my collection to watch more than once."
4,Good action flick,Plenty of action with Stathan and DeNiro and Owen. Would recommend this movie. It kind of drags in spots but overall it is a film worth watching.
2,Not that good.,I love Robert Deniro and Jason Statham and this movie was pretty bad. Not just the dialog but the acting. I expected much better.
3,Product hasn't even shipped yet!!!!!,Might be a good idea to wait until the item ships before sending a review request LOL. Please forward to someone who can make the probramming changes.
4,good action movie,was exactly what i was expecting all in all i enjoyed it. i would recommend this to a friend for sure
3,Average Action Flick,"Owen and Statham are, as always, interesting and here make good enemies and share two nicely choreographed fight sequences. Despite that, the movie was more boring than it should have been (or, not nearly as good as it could have been). There was too much redundancy and a good edit to tighten things up a bit and vary the pacing, would made things more interesting. In fact,the De Niro subway scene later in the film was quite enjoyable and believable amidst the more frenetic fights and chases that occur quite often and at length. That said, a fun rental but not quite as good as the original, which had a cast better served by their director, Peckinpah."
2,Unbelivibaly Unmemorable,"It is obvious at the start of this film, the budget was blown on the actors.Writing, exposition and overall delivery fell short of the amazing lineup on the bill. This film does not deliver and is a colossal waste of time. I'd have turned it off- but It was like a car wreck I couldn't walk away from.Robert DeNiro- he's on the cover- but disappears for about and hour and a half during the crux of the story-line. While Statham is generally compelling to watch, and Owen is convincing- they cannot hold up this bag of hot air.Seriously- go vacuum your rugs- it would be a better use of your time."
3,Killer Elite,"A decent Saturday night movie, nothing new to the genre! Good cast, there are better movies, but on a whole very watchable and interesting!"
3,"Statham, DeNiro and Owen deliver what you'd expect but script sometimes boring","Jason Statham, Robert De Niro and Clive Owen in an Action Thriller conjures up certain expectations in everyone's mind and the movie comes pretty close to delivering just that. Great acting of a storyline that is pretty much action interspersed with monotone strategic dialogue which I found lacking. I think it would have been more of a box office hit if they had added some younger hunks as well as female eye candy."
1,Killer Elite,"Jason Statham quickly went from witty Guy Ritchie discovery to fully fledged action star, so much so that he even earned a spot in the distinguished, testosterone-fueled lineup of Sylvester Stallone's Expendables franchise. Unfortunately, I have only liked a few of Statham's starring vehicles. Enter Killer Elite, which teamed Statham with the legendary Robert De Niro and ""why isn't he a bigger star"" Clive Owen. That should help, right? Apparently, no, not really. I found Killer Elite, which had a De Niro-mentored Statham, a special ops vet, squaring off against Owen's militant crime leader, to be utterly by-the-books and disposable. Expendable, even. While tI admit that I had a reasonably good time, I mostly felt the proceedings were all too familiar. If you don't mind a bit of ""been there, done that"" in your shoot-em-ups, feel free to give this one a spin."
2,I wanted to like it...,"Sometimes a movie will have all the right ingredients but somehow the finished product doesn't add up. For me. this is what happened with this movie. I love a good mindless action flick and this one had many good actors. I feel the director played a part in what was lacking. For one, the character development was poor. We WANT to like these guys but there wasn't alot to latch onto; Statham was Statham, DeNiro's character was one dimensional (kept waiting for more and it never came), Owen's character had no likability at all, etc, etc.. The one on one fight scenes were SO annoying, worse than the wiggly camera trend. You could barely see what was going on. It was also hard to keep up with what was going on with the plot, there didn't seem to be alot of emphasis on making sure the viewer understood what was happening.At the end of this film, all I could think of was what was wrong with it. I won't be giving this director a 2nd chance."
1,No digital copy,It did not come with a digital copy as in the picture of the movie cover the movie I should have returned it
3,A re-release?,"I've seen this movie before, a few years back. Is this a new releasedate, to sucker people into watching it again, thinking it is a new movie?"
3,Don't pay for it.,Nothing special. I'd recommend watching it if you can get it for free. A true 3 out of 5. The setting in Europe is a nice change.
3,"Not bad, but nothing special either","At first glance, Killer Elite appears to be little more than a vehicle for action star Jason Statham, and by all means that's pretty much what it is, just with the luxury of having Robert De Niro and Clive Owen in supporting roles. Statham plays Danny, a retired contract killer in the early 80s that gets drawn back into the game when his mentor and friend (De Niro) gets kidnapped and soon enough Danny finds himself on a reluctant mission, and eventually on the run from another pro (Owen) that's just as driven as he is. While Killer Elite manages to pack enough nicely orchestrated action set pieces, there isn't anything here you haven't seen before. Not to mention that were it not for the star power of Statham, Owen, and De Niro; not many would probably pay much attention to it in the first place. That aside, Killer Elite offers enough standard action and solid performances from everyone involved to warrant it getting a look at the very least."
3,"Average, but worth the view","The story went by a little slower than I would have liked. The movie has bullets, explosions, car chase, and boobs. So it fulfills the action movie requirements well, but takes a while for the story to come together. Its worth watching it, but just not certain about buying it."
2,The trailer is the best part.,"While this film is not all that bad and there is some pretty good action, it still leaves a great deal to be desired. For one thing it is nothing like the original which while also fairly forgettable, Sam Peckinpah did direct it with enough style to give it merit. In that version James Caan plays an Ex-CIA commando that is injured and must regain his mobility before he can resume his duties, Through a great deal of the film he's coping with his injuries and gaining new strategies in training. This film bares no resemblance at all with the original except where the title stands and the fact that the characters have job simularities. The trailer contains nearly every scene of action that is included in the film except maybe one I can think of. And when you know De Niro's name is connected with it and he's one of the main characters you really expect a good deal more. All in all it's a pretty familiar story and done a lot better in other films."
4,Good Cast and Action Flic,Enjoy the 3 action stars playing off each other. Supposedly based on a actual story. Would highly recommend it to an action movie fan.
4,Killer Elite is Awesome,"If you like covert ops action movies, this is a must watch. And Robert De Niro is in this movie!"
5,Hard to follow plot....great action movie though!,"Don't ask me to explain the plot of this film. However it was good to see Robert DeNiro team up with Jason Stathem and go up against Clive Owen. Jason has some real good action scenes and they are right up there with the Transporter films. As far as DeNiro is concerned, I have to wonder why he hasn't done more action movies. His performance was just as convincing. He didn't phone in his performance. He lent a lot of character to an ohterwise confusing film."
1,This book should not be sold,This book is nothing but a diatribe against all things German. Absolutely scandalous that this would even be sold. There is almost no sentence where Germans are not put down. Villa Elsa is garbage.
4,Project-o-Stand,"This stand is excellent,compact,lightweight and sturdy. For those who need to travel with a projector this is a great stand!"
5,Neat Little Stand For Homemade Teleprompter,"Although this stand (and tiny table) can be used for a multiple ofprojects. We've used it as a stand as a portable, homemade teleprompter.Get a simple piece of glass half-silvered mirror (instructions are allover the web), a picture frame and a free teleprompter program, sitit atop this table, shoot your camera through the back of the mirror,and you just made yourself a portable teleprompter that does everythinga several thousand dollar unit will do ... all for under a hundred bucks!Good product. Versatile. I could go on and on how this productcame in handy, but I'm sure, if you're the creative sort, you'll figuresome great uses out for it."
2,"Eventually, the seat goes flat ...","I bought this chair on black Friday, 2005. In less than 2 years, the seat of this chair is gone totally flat and now when I sit on it, you can feel the metal supports under the seat cushion. I'm 5'11"" and weigh 170 lbs., so it can't be me."
1,You get what you pay for!,"This chair SUCKS BIG TIME! I had this crappy chair for ONE WEEK before it started to fall apart whenever I leaned back (and I'm not that fat either--5'11, 170 pounds!!) This chair was made in China under sweatshop conditions and it SHOWS! Somebody call Ralph Nader, because I want my money back Target and/or Amazon.com!"
3,High Back Executive Leather Chair,"I'm very satisfied with my chair, and the comfort it delivers. The quality and durability is excellent. Well worth the price."
2,Not worth it!,This chair only last me a couple of years before the whole thing fell apart. If I'm going to pay that much money I expect it to last a lot longer then 2 years.
1,Terrible,"Disregard the positive review. This book is a nightmare. There's aren't many defects I could point out that the other reviewers haven't done a good job covering already, other than to say they're dead on. Perhaps the only thing I could add would be to say that if the Chinese department at the school where you take classes still uses the PCR series, you should seriously consider a change of major."
1,"Good Product Design, Wrong Razors For the Job","I spent good money investing in the Head Blade products, but unfortunately, they don't use safety razors and its just too easy to nick and cut yourself badly. None of my friends continue to use the Head Blade product, but we all like the Head Slick shaving creme. Once they license a safety razor, we'll come back, as the product itself is innovative and ergonomically great. I just could not keep from taking plugs of scalp from my head, most every shave..."
4,"Haven't watched the movie yet, but...",This is the movie that started Paul Newman's racing career. AND it has Paul Newman in it! I can't imagine it being bad in any way.
3,A look at late 1960's auto racing,"I saw this in the theater about 40 years ago. As far as a movie, it's far, far from Paul Newman's best effort.... nor does this in the same league as ""Grand Prix"" or ""Le Mans"". But, it's watchable, and if you collect racing stuff, it's a ""must have"". The footage at Indy is pretty good, and late 1960's Indy cars are, to my eye, some of the best looking racecars ever."
2,Not as bad as Driven,"Maybe it's because I watched this movie within days of the astoundingly great ""Grand Prix"", but I though ""Winning"" was a shambles of a movie. The thin plot barely made sense, and a the few stylized ""racing"" sequences weren't worth the time it takes to watch them. I like Paul Newman, but his performance in ""Cool Hand Luke"" was far better.I'm hopeful that Le Mans will be better than this movie, which was edited with a sawzall."
4,Great Guy; Good Film.,Some afternoon or evening when you want to watch racing films watch Grand Prix with Jim Garner and this film. If time allows throw in LeMans with Steve McQueen.
2,What a waste,No real action. Joanne Woodward is hot but is sadly portrayed as nothing more than a common slut. John Boy belongs on the farm and not in this movie or any other movie...
4,Good vintage racing footage,"It's great to see the vintage racing at Indy, Road America, Riverside, and even IRP (I think it's Lucas Oil speedway now)! The plot's ok but it's the racing that makes this enjoyable. Standard ending for a Hollywood racing movie but entertaining still."
5,Cool!,"I bought this specifically for a trip to the Atlanta area in August. I am particularly sensitive to heat and needed a way to keep cool during an outdoor event.This product is a vest filled with crystals that absorb water and the slow evaporation of that water provides a cooling sensation.The vest allowed me to enjoy the day in comfort and without exacerbating my symptoms.Mine is a gray and silver color combination, so it provides what I've taken to calling my robo-cop look!It was available for a good price and delivery was prompt."
5,straight,"Most 16 gauge finish nailers are angled. These are straight, for a 16gauge straight finish nailer.They are good quality, good steel, are collated well. Not much else to say.Hope that helps."
3,Solid; 3.5,This is a very good introduction to the peoples who left behind the impressive mounds in eastern North America. This book is pitched at an undergraduate level. Milner provides a chronologically arranged review of the prehistory of eastern North America. He sticks closely to the archeaology of sites and is careful to avoid speculation beyond what the often modest evidence provides. Milner is a workmanlike writer who does a solid job of describing excavations and their probable significance. The illustrations are very good and there is anice appendix describing sites that can be visited. Deficiencies of this book are that there is relatively little discussion of why cultures changed. Were there climactic factors? Some comparisons with other evolving cultures of the Americas could have been enlightening.
5,Great Reference Book,As a teacher of middle school I found this book to be a great reference in class.
3,Just a reference item,I enjoy having the book as a reference but I would never sit down and ready it from front to back. I did appreciate the clean black and white graphics espically when they were describing a product I have never used. I purchased this item as a supplement to a college class and it has worked out well when I need technical support for project reports.
4,The wonderful Lottchen..........,"Elisabeth Schumann is a quintessential, and perhaps among the last, icons of the finest in the best in the Lieder tradition--where you not only must marvel at the beauty of her voice, the intonation and control, but also are able to hear, distinctively, every syllable consonant.......she can also be heard not only in the traditional Schubert-Schuman=Brahms repertoire, or in Wagner.She pairs wonderfully with Lauritz Melchior, Herbert Jansen and Emanuel List in Walkuere, Acts I and II.If I failed to give it five stars it is because the earliest recordings sound a bit tinny......not her fault but obsolescent technology......"
5,My fanatasy romance!,"I've watched this wonderful movie over and over again on tv, and it's never on often enough. Just makes a person think of the possibilities out there if one is just willing to try a different road sometime."
3,Not in very good shape,Condition wasn't very good - doesn't play as well as would like for the price. Would like to have found a better quality VHS or a DVD
5,A fun and funny romance,"A friend of my mother taped it from TV for her, and then my mother loaned it to me. Quite a few years ago, I purchased the movie and then lent it to someone else, who moved away without returning it to me. I'd really like to have it again, but the new price here is unreasonable, especially in this economic climate. What I'd like to know is, when is someone going to put it on DVD?This is a very nice, unexpected romance movie, with none of the unnecessary, obscene sweaty bodies rolling around mindlessly in bed. Marilu Henner's performance is mostly very fine, but occasionally a bit forced. Daniel Massey (yes, the son of the late, great Raymond Massey, although Daniel lived with his mother after his parents' divorce) shows just the right amount of cynicism and curmudgeonlyness (if that's a word). He's curt but cute.Please, Amazon, put some pressure on someone to put this movie on DVD!"
1,don't bother,"I have purchase two of these Vidal Sassoon Soft Bonnet Dryers.The first I had for about one year, & it just died. Also, the soft bonnet had to be replaced after a few months.Vidal Sasson number 2 died after the very first use. Black smoke starting coming out of it. Don't bother with this thing."
1,Cheap,I owned this dryer for 3 days and the plastic bonnet pulled away from the hose so it no longer hooks to the dryer. Cheap! Don't waste your money!
2,Don't waste your $$,"I bought the dryer to mainly deep condition my hair and occasionally to dry my hair without the use of the blowdryer. At first it was all that I needed. The dryer has 3 heat settings and the bonnet is large enough to fit any head. It's design is sleek and compact ...fitting nicely anywhere. It also left my hair very manageable and not overly dry.However, my excitement was short lived. After about 4 uses the bonnet separated from the hose i.e. the point where the hose hooks into the bonnet is no longer in place...rendering my new dryer useless. When using the dryer I was mostly inactive, sitting in front of the television or surfing the net...so I can assure you that its malfunction is not from misuse but from bad and cheap design. It is also a very noisy dryer for its small size."
2,Doesn't last lon,"I didn't have this dryer for 7 months before the motor started rattling and I had to have the whole thing replaced. Now I'm on my second dryer, and the bonnet didn't last long. First the elastic went, and now I can't use the bonnet at all as it has separated from the ring that holds the hose. The hose is too short. The results are good, but this is a cheap product with poor design. If you buy this dryer, plan on replacing it (or its parts) very frequently. If you have that kind of time on your hands, you're better off than I am."
1,Untrained voices off key,"If good music got credit for tempo, this would be a great cd. The tracks would be great for a silent film cops and robbers chase. Unfortunately the off key voice of Ms. Karpel ruins it. The melody is sung as if on an American Idol. Sometimes,one has to learn it as a child or have heard it as a child to understand the song. Ms. Karpel's voice has such a limited range that it makes it impossible for her to sing the songs on this CD. She was off key and flat so often. She probably doesnt have a clue of how these songs were once song. I saw this band live and heard the same bad vocals. My mother sand ditties from Poland to me so I have a sense of how beautiful these songs could have sounded in better hands. However, Eve Sicular is talented as the drums and was the band leader."
4,An uplifting collection of audio joy,"Beautiful melodic electronica that takes you there. A bit more lyrics than I prefer, but definitely delivers on pinnacle trance climaxes. Euphoric."
3,A great slice of history; and the motivations of Rudolf Hess,Euan Lloyd's production of Wild Geese II loses continuity of first Wild Geese (1978) because of the sudden death of Richard Burton a few weeks into the location filming. Edward Fox is too bland and Scott Glenn as the mercenary gives us one of the early glimpses into why he was never leading man material. Short bio clip on Hess early in film is very well done. At least the viewer knows who Rudolf Hess is.
3,"Nothing to do with the first movie, but OK.","Wild Geese 2 has no common link with The wild geese, other than that they are both mercenary films. The acting ranges from darn good, to pretty poor. Sir Lawrence plays a small part with a monologue at the end. The Wild Geese (the first one) is better, but there are a couple of isolated good scenes here that make the movie worth while."
1,Poor and Unnecessary Sequel to a Fine Film,"I liked the first film so much, I thought I'd give this one a shot. This was horrible. Story of Mercanaries attempting to break Rudolf Hess out of prison in Germany. Without Richard Burton this film falls flat on its face, and the whole project should never have gone forward after Burton's unfortunate death. This sequel was very unneccessary anyway. It should've been a film by itself. If you haven't already, than see the first movie, it is so much better. Try this if you want but I don't reccomend it."
5,Ideal book club book,"Jerome Richards has created a nuanced, thought-provoking and well-crafted novel in his debut, ""The Kiss of the Prison Dancer."" Set in San Francisco in the 1970s, it is a gripping meditation on responsibility, guilt and ethics. The protagonist, Max Friedman, is a solitary Holocaust survivor who is confronted with a haunting moral dilemma.""Kiss of the Prison Dancer"" would make a perfect book club discussion choice: it is relatively short, but packed full of interesting ideas and situations to discuss."
3,Description,"Aloha...Does anyone know if this hitch cover will fit 1.25 or is this only made for 2"" hitches? Description is lacking vital information.Mahalo."
5,"Magical, memorable","This is a completely adorable, inspired and inspiring creation by Mr. Lobel. This book with audio was a mainstay of my children's early years and holds memories we will always cherish."
4,A Very Nice Book,The book is about a mouse who gets caught by a weasel and is about to be cooked in a soup (Mouse Soup). Right before the mouse gets cooked the weasel wants the soup to have stories so it will taste better. So the mouse tells 3 stories and distracts the weasel. The weasel goes & gets more stuff for the soup so it will taste great. When he gets home ...I thought it was a wery cute book! It would help a little kid with there story telling skills. I Would definetly recommend this book to a 1st grader or read it to my own little sisters.
5,One of the all-time classics,"Arnold Lobel is one of my all-time favorite children's authors. Not just funny and whimsical, he has a feel for language and form - his books are beautifully written. And ""Mouse Soup"" is a real gem. I love all the stories, but one I use most often in my work as an early-childhood music teacher is ""The Crickets."" Children love to chirp along, louder and louder as the story goes on, to unwittingly disturb the poor mouse. Sometimes I have another child act out the part of the mouse, who's trying to get to sleep. The illustrations are charming and distinctive. Beautiful, sweet, funny book."
5,Still charming after all thes years,"I haven't read this book since my own children were young. As I added a new fresh copy to my library collection I spent a few minutes and read it. Yes, it is still charming. It deserves to be introduced all over again to a new generation of readers and I will do just that. Recommended for independent readers in the primary grades or as a read aloud."
2,Totally inappropriate message,"My son brought this home from the school library. We read it last night and he was devastated by the end. It presents the way a mouse retaliates against a predator. He lies and manipulates the weasel into getting stung by bees, covered in mud, carry heavy rocks, be tortured by crickets and injured by a thorn bush. While the weasel is off getting hurt per the mouse's instructions, the mouse escapes. yeah mouse. This teaches horrible things, and after all the weasel has to eat, and goes hungry at the end. This last thing was also not lost on my almost 7 year old. I was sad I had him read it. We had to read a happy book after (shark vs train), because he was too upset to sleep after this ""award winning"" authors book."
2,Boring,"I was disappointed- I know this author's other work and I know he has won some accolades. We were given this book as a gift and settled in to read it (my daughter is 3.5). Wow, I found the sub-stories incredibly boring! Not just boring but also without much objective. I liked the overarching premise/storyline but even that part had no finesse in terms of building up excitement or humor, etc. The weasel and mouse have no personality whatsoever. I struggled to try to keep reading it because I found it such a chore. My daughter seemed okay with it but the second is was done, she moved on. I don't think it left any impression with her."
5,Must have for collectors,"This is one of the most amazing books written about vintage costume jewelry. The examples shown are ones most collectors can only dream of one day owning. The photography is fabulous, and the jewelry is world class. This compact book is easy to take anywhere, and more interesting each time you pick it up."
5,Miracle Pill,"I have used these since childhood (approx. 35 years). Not only do they work, I have not had a poison ivy or oak outbreak in at least 10 years. It seems that I have built up a tolerance so that I no longer have an allergic reaction to the weed. I live on 13 wooded acres and have plenty of poison ivy on my property so I know I had to have come in contact with it. Also, I love to be outdoors. At one point I was pulling down a vine that was growing on a tree I was trying to save. I was bare handed. After doing so my husband pointed out that the week I was pulling on was poison ivy. Even with the tolenerce thing disregarded, the pills make the rash diminish almost immediately."
4,Not itching no more,These little pills really do work.. simply follow the directions -- and you won't beleive how soon you to will stop itching.
3,It's Pajama Game with the same vocals as the movie,"OK for what it is. But it isn't the 33.3 rpm that I remember and love. It's true CD compared with vinyl is lack luster. It has all the songs and that's great. Plus extra Doris Day songs -- never really wanted. It's kind of disappointing, but you cannot return to the past. I think it's better if I just buy a record player and find an old 33.3 rpm."
5,I love this book!,I love this book! The pig is an example of what perserverance and belief in yourself can do. The pig believed he could do it and he did!
5,MAGNIFICO DIEGUITO!,"TIENE TODO LO QUE SE ESPERA DE EL, LA SELECCION DE LAS CANCIONES, LOS ARREGLOS, LA CALIDAD DE LA IMAGEN Y EL SONIDO SON PERFECTAS, SIN DUDA LA MEJOR CANCION ES ""USTED"" Y EL DUO CON VICENTICO LE DIO ESE TOQUECITO DE ""DESORDEN MAGICO"".EN LOS BONUS, DIEGO APARECE DE UN COMICO!!! NO SE IMAGINAN LO GRACIOSO QUE ES.EN FIN CREO QUE NO ME CANSARE DE VERLO!"
5,It is a good piece,"Let me tell you that this is a good piece to buy, technicaly it has good sound, and it has a lot of convesations from Diego Torres unadded to the CD version, he has an excellent performance, the only thing that desapoints me a little bit is that the DVD has a song less than the CD.Buy it is a good piece."
5,A book that will get you motivated to decorate cookies!,"As a student of Toba Garrett in NYC, I knew before I bought this book that it would be wonderful, and it is!!! --the recipes are easy to make, and the decorating is simple enough for the novice and stunning enough to challenge those with skill.(If you have never decorated before, Toba explains step by step along with numerous color pictures to guide you) You'll make cookies that you never thought possible. Definitly a must have!"
3,It's ok,I was hoping for more step by step photos and instructions. I was also hoping for a bigger Christmas Cookie section - there were only a few ideas for the biggest cookie making/decorating time of the year.
4,A Feast for Your Eyes and Your Palate!,"I purchased this book in order to get some better ideas on cookie and dessert decorating techniques. Boy, I was in for a surprise! The directions are easy, geared to beginners (like myself) and the results are fabulous. Like anything, it takes some practice, though! I plan on taking Ms. Garrett's classes at Peter Kump's Culinary School in New York City after reading this book! It is a definite plus for anyone who loves to bake cookies, and is always looking for an excuse to do so! And, as a bonus, the recipes in the bake are phenomenal!"
2,Not what I expected,"This cookie book is not for the beginner, too complicated and not easy to follow; more like a story book. With only a few recipes and intricate designs -- not something for everyday use.Silvana"
2,"Beautiful, but not tasty!",The samples shown are beautiful. Her directions are not as specific as they should be. I just made her Christmas cookies with her butter cookie recipe and it tasted like a big heaping pound of powdered sugar. Bleck!
5,You're gonna love it!,"This is a really helpful book for anybody wanting to learn to decorate beautiful cookies. I'm really enjoying the recipes in the back, in particular the Almond Paste Cookies. I've made them twice and with two toddlers in the house, they seem to disappear faster than I can decorate them. I highly recommend this book."
5,Can't say enough good things,"What a beautiful book this is! If you have a passion for decorating cookies and are looking for ideas that are above the average, try this one. Wonderful classy ideas, great pictures of the end results and clear patterns and descriptions. Sure, these cookies will take more time than average to make, but the end result will definately be worth it."
5,Magical!!,"Toba Garrett's Creative Cookies book fills a niche in the Cookbook market. There are no other books out there that are as clear, inspirational and as easy to follow. You will make cookies that go beyond anything you've ever seen in the stores and they will taste amazing too!! This is a must have for anyone who loves this art form."
2,Too Advanced for Me!!!,"I think this is a beautiful book and offers wonderful ideas on gorgeous cookie decorations, but it is WAY too advanced for me, a good baker but beginning decorator. I am returning it, because I don't even think the generic cookie tips are worth keeping, as the whole thing is too advanced. If you are a good decorator already and have the talent and time and willingness to make elaborate gift-quality cookies, this is truly a find, but otherwise, I'd skip it. I was really just looking for a book with fun decorating ideas for cookies for kids beyond the usual gingerbread man or pumpkin-cut sugar cookie with orange sprinkles! Creative ideas I need, but beautiful I cannot achieve."
4,a design masterpiece,"Ok..ok.. so im not into fondant on a cookie or a cake because, well, it tastes gross. HOWEVER..one can easily adapt each idea with color flow, royal icing or chocolate. I was entirely impressed at the quality of work and ideas. nicely done, in my opinion. if you like decorating cookies and need pictures for ideas...this is one i'd surely recommend for your confectionary library."
2,Fondant overload..,"If you like fondant this is the book for you. Almost all the cookies are covered in decorative fondant. Fondant looks great but tastes terrible. So if you want pretty cookies that are not very tasty this is the book for you. Cookie Craft is a much, much better cookie decorating book."
2,Disapppointed,"This book wasn't what I anticipated. Not alot of pictures for decorating ideas - so if you are looking for decorating ideas, this book is not the one you want1"
5,THE book,"If you buy no other book on cookie baking and decorating, buy this one. This book taught me how to decorate cookies. The recipes are also dynamite. The decorations range from basic to wowza and the instructions are clear. Best of all, the ""basic"" designs are still wonderful. Your friends say, ""oh how wonderful"" as you gaze at the ceiling and think, ""yeah, I did it with a toothpick!"" Everyone thinks you are brilliant and you didn't spend a zillion dollars on supplies or spend a week in the kitchen. Do you have to spend time on the cookies? Of course. Anything worth doing takes time. However, the glace icing is much easier to work with than Royal Icing and tastes soooooo much better. I have recommended this book to every student I have ever had - no one has ever been disappointed. In other words, buy this book, read this book, use this book and you will have a blast and have wonderful cookies as well."
5,A great debut,"I heard this CD playing in a store when I was on holidays in Vancouver and it immediately grabbed me so I bought it and it was a great purchase. I spent about 10 days driving around B.C. and I never grew tired of playing it. My favourite song is ""Close My Eyes"", which is a real tear-jerker but I love it! This is a great debut from Christine, it's hard to believe she is just 14 years old. I look forward to hearing her progress as an artist in the future, I'm sure she will end up being mentioned in the same breath as Sarah McLachlan."
5,Great Music for a Great Price,"i was working at 90.7 RAV FM's Summerjam concert, and Christine Evans was the headlining act. I had never heard of her (or heard her songs) before, but the music just blew me away.pick this up at $11 before she becomes big and the price goes up"
2,"Slow moving, but not bad","At first I thought the book was too slow, dragging out, then it got better, but by then I really didn't care anymore. I think that the author went a little overboard on Redmayne's ""bad"" past."
1,"So poorly written, I left it in the student center--","-- and no one took it.Yes, it lingered forlornly on the table for days! I was tempted to throw it in the recycling bin, but I had too much respect for it as a book.Personally, I don't ask much from a romance novel, because I read them as pure escapism, especially during finals. I want the romance to be believable, historical facts to be fairly close to accurate, and above all, the heroine must have a brain! I don't know if this book delivers on the first two, although I'm betting not on the historical side. I didn't get far enough into it, because the heroine was such a flake! She was saccharine and clueless, and I'm surprise the book isn't *still* sitting in the student center."
1,DeMille Has Done Much Better,"This book dragged from the first page to the last. DeMille put so much ""stuff"" in there it was like swimming through syrup. His later novels were so much better. I was disappointed in this book."
1,Fiction it is!,"Good thing this was not the first book I read by this author. This is his first attempt at writing in 1978 and he fails. It is an anti-Arab pro-Israel concoction with little brain power on both sides. The situation is supposed to resemble Masada, but even a six year old could figure that the besieged group would be out of drinking water after 4 days, and then go get them. But no, there is a lot of senseless slaughter, and then the good guys win. The characters are underdeveloped, the heroine is a slut who preaches morals, and the situation never changes page after page. You can skip this book. I recommend reading ""The Charm School"" by this author if you are interested in the machinations of the Evil Empire."
1,Awful politics,"Had to be one of the worst books that I've read on quite some time. First off, I'm a HUGE Demille fan. However, as many people have written here, I was not able to suspend reality (Especially given 9/11/2001) and the book appeared to me nothing more than a politcal agenda.I can see how this book would rock if it was written in another pretense, but I can't read about good guys in a book when they're not necessarily nice in real life!"
1,Very small print,"You should inform the purchasers when they are purchasing a book with extremenly small print. I refuse to read a book with such small print, much smaller than normal paper back books. The print was about a #2 font. It may be good for the printer/publisher but difficult for the reader."
1,Lousy Condition Rating,"We purchased this from an area that seemed to indicate it was a large print edition.... It was NOT.The ad indicated the book was used in VERY GOOD condition.... That was a big joke!!!! The pages areyellowed out and the front cover is also damaged..... Not a very happy camper about this one.... First timewe got JUNK from Amazon.com..... OH well, just like the old addage, let the buyer be screwed....OR was that beware??"
5,What a great movie this novel would make!,"I've just discovered Nelson Demille (having read ""Charm School"" first) and what a marvellous discovery he is! BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON is a timely story that feels more like news than fiction. I was overwhelmed with anger, rage, pity, fear, compassion while reading this book: I hated for it to end (and plan to read it again). It's an incredibly moving story that should remind us all which side we're on since 9/11!Even after visiting the Demille homepage, the only thing I can't figure out is how one man can know so much about flying, bombs, weapons, war strategy, terrorist organizations, the Israeli government, and human beings. Demille's prose is so authoritative and convincing--even in the minute details.I plan to read as many Demille novels as I can get my hands on."
2,By the Rivers of Mediocre Writing,"Here we have a somewhat thriller. A peace delegation is gathering to discuss the prospects of peace in Israel/Palestine. A large group of negotiators is flying from Israel to the peace talks in two Concorde jet planes. The planes have been sabotaged by Palestinians. One of the planes crash lands in an area where the occupants are able to defend themselves from hordes of ""savage"" Palestinians. There is a woman who is the love interest of about three different people. She is portrayed as a bleeding heart liberal and has to be slapped around by the ""realistic"" right wing leader of the defense. The bad guys are just bad guys with no human traits whatsoever. A pretty dumb book. i give it one star up from the lowest rating based on the little bits of real info about ancient Babylon, ancient Jewish history, the Sumerians, and so on."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Good beginning ( first 1/10 of book)>>>Rest of book dragged terribly...Cannot compare to ""The Lion's Game"" ,""The Lion"", ""Charm School""....Too many characters that are the same...Seems to be written by another author completely...Too repetitious..ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
5,By the Rivers of Babylon,Demille lovingly describes the minds and hearts of the people of Israel both the modern and ancient.
2,A little Weak,this book was a little weak in content. a lot of characters and tough to identify with most of them. not truly developed. And i'm a big Demille fan - this one fell short along w/cathedral
4,Historical,"My Aunt recomended this author and instructed me to start with this first book. I was impressed with the historical acuracy as well as the detailed accounts of weapons used in battle. My favorite characters are always snipers, and there was an acurate one in this story. This story combines love, war and life to keep you reading. The best part is, this story could be re-written with today's dates and still be just as acurate."
3,Would Be Better As A Movie,"This book would would probably be better as a movie than it was as a book. In fact, it would make a great movie. It's easier to stretch reality to its limits in a film. In the book, it becomes almost ludicrous. I did like the book though, particularly the last third or so when it begins to rock. I would definitely recommend reading it, but it's not nearly the best in its genre."
4,"Good, but not DeMille's best","One of his earlier novels, packed with non-stop action and charismatic characters, but lacking the great humor and dialogues of later works like Night Fall and Plum Island."
5,A Must Read,"I have read all of Tom Clancy, Vince Flynn, Brad Thor, James W. Huston, John Grisham and most of Michael Connelly, and DeMille's Books and "" By The Rivers Of Babylon "" is in a group of one of my favorites. The book is well written, fast paced to the point I didn't put it down, and you felt so engrossed in the characters."
5,A gripping look into the war for peace,"As a first time reader of Nelson Demille, I must say that this book totally drew me in with vivid details and heart-wrenching stories of heros and villains. As a Jew who has somewhat lost touch with his heritage, ""By the Rivers of Babylon"" brought a renewed sense of who we are and why we stick together through thick and thin. If you haven't read this one, read it now. If you have read it, pass it on to someone else because the story will delight readers of any religion and age."
4,Another Great Book,"I like Demille's books because they are a departure from the standard - guy gets killed, ace detective comes on the scene and figures it all out magically - type of book. This is my third novel by Mr. Demille and I can't quit.This one is a little bit slower moving that the others of his that I've read."
5,Not Just A Thriller!,"This is the best I've read of Nelson Demille! I was hooked by page 1. Written 30 years ago, in 1978, the signifigance of the Middle East setting and conflict so aptly correlates to our current affairs. A must read!"
5,Great flight in the face of history,"From the perspective of having read all of DeMille's popular books before I read this, his first one, I say that it is one of his very best. The book has a great, fast moving, albeit simple, plot: surviving an attach of maniacal terrorists while holed up in the ruins of ancient Babylon in the Iraqi desert. Some of the story was gratuitously pro-Israeli (perhaps a holdover from DeMilles pulp fiction days: El-Al Airlines flying not one, but two, Concords, and taking off from Ben Grunion no less!) however these few historical inaccuracies did not detract from the story. In fact DeMille's historical tie in to the Babylonian Captivity worked quite well and even enhanced my appreciation of the history of the Jewish people. Yes, i thought it was that good."
3,"Military Buffs get ready, otherwise not my first choice","I am admittedly not a fan of military books. While I would definitely say this book was well written and researched, I can not say that the story captured me, in particular. It was gripping in places, but not a book for everyone.Specifically, the author gave wonderfully deep detail on a variety of military related topics such as flying an aircraft or descriptions of guns. Such detail would be really appreciated and enjoyed by lovers of military stories. To me, I found it a bit much.The story itself is highly pro-Israeli. While I don't quite know enough to have a strong opinion, I got the sense that someone who had either neutral/strong views of the opposite persuasion might - at times - be a little offended or annoyed.That said, if you love military books and do not have a conflicting political view, you will love this novel and most likely find it gripping."
3,"Mouse looks nice, but whats the point if it doesnt function right?","From time to time while I am using this mouse, like another user stated, it just seems not to be on the right axis.You will make it go one way, and it will go another way.Then, with that software installed, I can be listening to music on winamp while I am browsing the web, and all of a sudden, the volume goes alllll the way down. This is on its OWN! If I try to move the mouse, it will move the mouse on different parts of the screen and it will even click on its own which will sometimes close some programs I am running.In the beginning I was ok with it, but now it's an ongoing thing that just gets me FRUSTRATED."
3,"Over all, not that great",I have always used Logitech mouses but this one is driving me insane. After reviewing all the other reviews I am the 3rd person to have the same problem. Erratic mouse behavior and the volume increases spontaneously! Logitech site suggested that I don't connect through usb but even using the traditional mouse plug it still does the same thing.
2,Mouse Gone Wild!!!,"I bought the mouse after a great rebate brought the price down to under $20 bucks. I've had it for 2 weeks and have been somewhat satisfied so far. The ergonomics as mentioned in the other reviews arent that comfortable as a Microsoft mouse. The mouse is indeed to thin as I find that my ring finger often rests on the table and not the mouse. This is something that I dont mind for the price I paid for a cordless mouse.However, for the past 2 days the mouse has been acting up. It will go act as if the - volume button is stuck and keep on reducing the volume. And sometimes by pressing the + volume button, it will act as pause. This is in addition to the cursor not going where it should too (Kinda acts like a drunk driver). I don't know if this has happened to anyone before, but I am pretty sure its the mouse as I've been using the same computer for 4 years no problems. If anyone else gets this problem, please let other know as normally Logitech is a very reliable company. ."
3,"I have small hands, this mouse doesnt fit right. bad ergonomics","i like the classic logictec mouse feel, with all the buttons straight ahead.this one feels funny since its crimped in the middle (the casing).old style mouse users beware, this is not your classic mouse with new features and buttons."
1,Don't buy it,"Amazon shipped me a used one of these mice, it didn't work right so I shipped it back and the replacement they sent was also used. The second one worked ok but it was only a matter of minutes till my hand/wrist hurt because of the bad ergonomics. The batteries are in the back of the mouse near the ""butt"" of the mouse which makes the mouse feel imbalanced when you pick it up. As if that wasn't enough of a reason to avoid buying this mouse the pointer stops moving or jumps across the screen so frequently that I couldn't stand it and quickly returned the mouse for a refund. Consider yourself warned, don't buy it."
2,DO NOT BUY IT,"I got mouse. Decided to test it for a week.I love media buttons, also forward and backward buttons make reading web pages comfortable. Mouse is light, looks great.BUT ! - Device is ergonomicly so wrong - I couldn'd believe.You have a hard time presing left and right button. You can not pick up mouse - because is slim in the midle. Mouse is not balanced - so when you pick it up - back go down. Just Terrible.I am waiting for hybrid of previous version of mouse and current one. For now I recommend NOT BUY IT."
2,not suitable for work,The buttons of the mouse are really awkward. You have to push hard. Your fingers will suffer fatigue quickly...
4,"Mouse is great for watching movies, listening to music and playing games.","I love this mouse because you can change volume, next track or back track, and you can set the buttons to whatever you feel like. Its great for playing games and just chilling and relaxing. Only thing I didn't like about this mouse was the plastic around the lower side. A lot of the newer mice out there dont have this hard plastic on bottom, they have some cushion or something for your thumb to rest on. Otherwise, this is a great product!"
4,Great functional mouse,"I really like this mouse..I've had it for 3 months. The things that I like most about it are1. The media buttons can be used just like a remote. Many (butnot all) music programs are compatible. You can skip throughtracks or change the volume instantly2. Battery-life seems excellent3. Scrolling is excellent, very accurate on almost any surface4. Mouse feels very comfortable when navigating the cursor or whenusing as a remote.The only negative thing is that it is a bit large...but comfort would be sacrificed if it was made smaller. Also, is a bit heavy. Still portable.Would definitely buy again!"
2,the problem i have had,"The mouse is great most of the time. However, it seems to occasionally it stops moving on an axis. It happens in both the x and y direction randomly. It is not a receiver problem either, it happens no matter how i place the receiver."
4,Logitech Media Play Mouse is great.,"This is a great mouse with a good amount of buttons. However, I would like this mouse slightly more if all of the buttons on it were programmable, not just most of them."
5,Logitech MediaPlay Mouse,Powerfully convenient and comfortable. Well orchestrated availability and delivery. A great product for all.
5,PERFECT,"everything is ok, i offer this mouse to everybody. long range, no interference, good looking... i love logitech, i love amazon..."
3,It would be 5 stars if:,"this mouse would be perfect if it didnt have a mind of its own at times. i love the features of the mouse which is why i decided to get it in the first place, but sometimes pretty often it has malfunctions such as the the volume shooting up to the highest level blasting my music when i didnt do a thing. Also the cursor sometimes will have a mind of its own shooting suddenly to other parts of the screen. lastly, it can have problems running smoothly on certain flat surfaces including some mousepads. these problems are all annoying, but it is nonetheless a very good mouse if you want yours to be a media player remote as i do."
2,Doesn't live up to the concept,"Mouse is too small. Buttons are too small. And on a media play mouse, it doesn't even have a mute button!But it looks good and is lightweight. Able to turn off mouse to save batteries.I had problems with the mouse software. I currently have a Logitech cordless optical mouse and cordless keyboard. When I first hooked up the media play mouse (but did not install the software), all functions worked except the media functions (which is exactly what you would expect). But as soon as the media software was installed, the forward and back functions stopped working. Uninstalled and tried again - same result. Since I surf the web alot, the lack of being able to use the back/forward functions makes this mouse next to useless for me.How hard is it to get the software correct? Geez. Very disappointed..."
5,something new...,"This guy knows music. Not surprisingly for someone who is so intricately involved in the Nashville Muzik Mafia scene...It's refreshing to find an album that can pay tribute to so many different genres of music. Every song is completely new. Creative the way that original music is supposed to be. Including elements of heavy rock, spicy soul, and a piano bluesy feel. His voice has a gritty emotional feel to it that is tempered by his enthusiasm on the faster tunes.Jon can pull off the ballads as well as the rock tunes- check out Nothing At All or his simple duet Grass River... and Grandma has a fun reflective tone as he sings of tokin with his grandmother. And of course there's the simple Hero which really shows off his bluesy slant and his beautiful soulful voice.This is one of those albums that true music lovers will listen to all the way through. Can't wait to see his next effort!"
2,Perspective,"I would hate for any potential buyer of this CD to be swept up in the unbelievably positive reviews left here by folks who I can't help but think are friends of Jon Nicholson. Generally, this album is a fairly competent, though wholly unoriginal and uninspired collection of songs trying desperately to get on the radio. So, if that is your thing, then go for it. You'll love this album. But if you are searching for something with innovation and original artistry (not to mention great listening), you should keep looking.That said, the music laid down here does occasionally hit a nice groove. But, it's rare, and you'd do better to buy an old classic than use your budgeted CD money here."
2,A Bit of a Disappointment,"I often buy Britcoms sight-unseen and loved David Jason in Fools and Horses, and Open All Hours. This was a bit of a let down. Interesting, but not funny. Amusing maybe? I haven't laughed yet although I see the humor in human fickleness."
3,John Little is No Mike Mentzer,"I was excited when I discovered that this books was being released. I ordered it immediately. You see, Mike passsed before completing this book, and John Little finished it. In many ways, I was looking forward to Mike's last words to his fans. Unfortunately, perhaps Mr. Little was not the man for the job. There are contradictions all over the place, exposing Mr. Little as not half the disciplined, rational thinker Mike Mentzer developed himself into. The book has what you need to know, but I would heartily suggest Mike Mentzer's ""Heavy Duty II: Mind and Body"" over this book, which is essentially a rehash, but with John-Little dilution of Mike's direct, effective writing. It is worth getting if you want to complete your library or cannot get HDII."
4,It worked for me,"I read a lot of reviews about this book before getting the Kindle version of it. Yes, It contains a lot of philosophy and physiology before you get into something concrete, but I think that in order to invest time and effort pursuing something, I have to be convinced before from an intellectual point of view, and that is what this book did for me. About half the book the concrete part begins, routines, exercises, recomendations, i.e all you need to start lifting weights in a intelligent way.But like everything, this book has its weaknesses, for example, it lacks in the nutrition department, so you have to buy Mike Mentzer Heavy Duty Nutrition book in order to get a clue about how to feed yourself to grow."
2,"Poor Advice and Reasoning, HIT still valuable technique","This book claims to be a ""scientific"" analysis of body building principles, yet it seems its authors haven't the slightest clue what science is. Science involves investigation, experimentation and observation.This book is closer to a philosophy of of body building, and unfortunately like all philosophy, this is as much wishful thinking and self deceit as truth.The good: HIT is a valuable tool for body building.The bad: If you only do HIT you won't gain any muscle at all. Some muscles (in fact I would say most) *REQUIRE* high reps to build successfully. *Period*For an alternate view I would recommend a Schwarzenegger book like ""Education of a body builder"" or his encyclopedia."
2,Machismo Trure,This book opens up for the laymen and bodybuilding freaks but is against the principle of individual differences.Steroid using bodybuilders may acheive progress but think abouit the average natural gym folk.
4,HIT works,"After working out for 14 years, you get caught up in the latest workouts out there and lose sight of the basics. HIT was what I started with and made awesome gains then. I was glad to read and use what was in the book. I have overcame my plateau and making great gains again."
2,Wish I had'n't spent the $,"If you're new to abbreviated training or HIT (High Intensity Training), you'll probably get a lot out of this book. However, I've read, followed, appreciated, and gotten stronger following the advice in Stuart McRobert's books, which are much more detailed and useful. While Mentzer does a good job of articulating his philosphy, it didn't make sense that the ""exercise"" portion of the book focused on isolation exercises (curls, etc.), rather than compound exercises such as squats, dips, etc., that pay much higher weight lifting dividends."
5,Faces with Blue,"I got this book for my daughter when she was about a year old. She loved it and asked for it over several months. She loved pointing to her nose, eyes, and mouth, and playing 'peekaboo' with Blue on the last page. I don't recall any confusion regarding nose and mouth. The book was interactive enough to be a real hit at the early toddler stage, plus it reinforced some very basic body vocabulary words."
2,Not for children 7 yrs.old,This bike arrived in a box that was really badly torn. The bike was scratched and torn in several spots.The bike was ordered for my 7 year old grandaughter and it was not compatible with her hand size for the handlebar braking system. In addition to the wide grip it was overly difficult to squeeze.For the reasons listed above the bike was returned and my grandaughter had to wait for her Christmas bike. We instead went to a bike shop and of course found the perfect bike.
5,Excellent Historical Novel,"Outside of Michener's famous novel, ""Hawaii"", this is one of the best fiction works about Hawaii. Fictional characters are woven into a tapestry around the real Father Damien and how all their lives are affected by the curse of leprosy and exile to Molokai."
5,Great book!!,"My daughter ""loaned"" her copy to me. Found book refreshing as opposed to current books. In fact , I've already ordered same as Xmas present!!"
4,Molakai,"I enjoyed it very much and learn alot about this disease""Leprosy"" and the Island.The Hardship that people can endure in such a situation is incredible.I hope that the human race has learned from the experiences that they put these people through.but Human nature is always afraid of what it does not understand or can except."
2,Tedious,I wanted to like this book. Interesting topic - good locale - but then the author kept ending the paragraphs with a trite summary sentence. Hey - I knew that - I just read it in the paragraph before. So does the author think I'm not smart enough to understand the paragraph or does he need a good editor?
2,Snore,I think this was a different book also called Molokai - which is about a young leper girl who gets sent to the leper coleny - which is wonderful and a terrific read.As for this book...I couldn't get through enough of this book to even tell you what is about.
1,"Religious fanatasism - yes, History - NO","This book is more a work of fiction than a proper historical treatment of Washington's religious beliefs. It was painful to read such stretches of imagination. In the environment today it's not surprising that our first President is being remade in the light that we want instead of what he was. If you are deeply christian and your not concerned about accuracy or facts, than I think you will enjoy this book. If you are looking for a non fiction treatment of the subject or a historical view, look elsewhere."
1,mark in atlanta,"I find it a REAL stretch of history to assert that George Washington experienced an apparition of the Virgin Mary in his tent at Valley Forge (as the author asserts). Don't waste your money on this book. I was looking for something historical and factual, not something this off-the-wall. This work should be classified as fiction and not non-fiction."
1,As much a history as gravity is false,Quite interesting how tremendous in length someone would go to revision one of the greatest Americans to comform to the beliefs desired at the expense of the courtesy of doing him the justice of giving him a fair and objective historical analysis.
3,INCORRECT LABEL ON PRODUCT RECEIVED,"This review may not reflect the manufacturer of the product but it is important to be aware of advertising as it can be different to the actual product purchased. I purchased this Acetyl-L Carnitine primarily because I saw the ""CARNIPURE"" logo which indicates the ingredients is made with Carnipure, a particular source of L-carnitine which many regard as the purest available. When I received the product it did not have the ""CARNIPURE"" logo on it as the one in the advertised picture did. I contacted Amazon about this and they immediately dispatched a replacement as a ""recovery"" to the problem without having information as to the nature of the problem. I suspected the same product was going to be sent so I intervened and stopped the shipment. To Amazon's credit they refunded me fully. In relation to the product itself, I contacted NOW and they advised me that they use more than one source of L-Carnitine and hence have removed the ""CARNIPURE"" logo from their product."
1,Poor quality control,"This product came in with crushed and doubled caps. The actual product itself did not agree with me despite having taken it in the past. I have no idea if they switched suppliers or outsourced the production. I fully intend to return this and get a refund. It is disturbing to see this lack of quality control from ""Now"" as in the past with them I have experienced a high quality product."
1,doesn't burn fat,I bought this because a friend of mine said she used this to help her burn fat. Well it didn't work for me I didn't feel any different when taking them so I decided to just stop taking them.
3,Acetyl-L Carnitine,"Maybe I have not given this product enough time, but I have not experienced any difference in my memory or general health. Was this supposed to be working by now?"
2,Searched for USB - Cannot use this product for my purpose,"I needed a USB headset with Mic and I still do. I went through the list, read reviews and ordered two sets. Excited when they arrived, open one and my heart sunk. It is not USB. Not the sellers fault. I can't use them. I need info for return just sooooo busy. Please help. One set unopened ann sitting in the boxIt is not fair for me to rate this - I cannot."
2,Mic stopped working after 6 months,"While the audio quality and comfort are satisfactory, the microphone portion of the headset in two of our headsets stopped working after six months of use."
5,Works Great Price is Great,Love this product so far I have not had any issues at all. The price was great and I would recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive VOIP headset.
3,Works good for a while.,This is the second one we have bought. The first one died within a year did use almost every day though because husband was in different country so did skype. For the price it is ok.
4,Quality headset for the price.,This is a decent for the price. Sound quality is pretty good and works well for online telephony.
5,Cyver Acoustics Stereo Headset,"Sound quality is very good. The microphone's position is adjustable, making it very comfortable to wear. One of the best headset I have ever bought."
5,Cyber Acoustics AC-401 Headset w/Mic,"According to my grandson who uses them with games and for chatting, they are awesome! I can't give you details of all the characteristics. He has had several sets of headphones but these are perfect for him."
2,Noisy sound files--or not?,"I can't decide if I like this headset microphone or not. I am using them for recording responses on a research project. The sound files when loaded into Audacity are fabulous. The pauses before voice onset look very clean. But when you listen to the sound files, there is a lot of white noise that wasn't present at the time of recording and doesn't show in Audacity. It isn't interfering with my data collection so I kept them, but I wouldn't buy them again."
3,Not comfortable at all!,"I am a girl and I can't imagine any guy especially the bigger guys being comfortable wearing them They are too small, too tight for me! Very uncomfortable."
3,"Worked Great, Until....","The unit sounds good. It LOOKS good. The boom mic is flexible, and the mute slider is handy. I was very well pleased, until the mic stopped working altogether. I wrote the manufacturer a week ago, but still have not gotten a reply. Not so good that way.For the price, I guess ya just buy another one, but it's a bit of a pain to be without it, and disappointing that the manufacturer didn't even bother to reply. So yes, very good, so long as it works, but bear that in mind.P.S. It has now been a number of months, still not a word back from the manufacturer. Disappointing."
1,Terrible Build Quality,"I have purchased over 15 of these headsets for my office to use for Skype. The sound quality is fine, and they are comfortable enough. The problem is that they break on a regular basis. Of the 15 I've purchased, at least 10 of them have had the microphone stop working within 3 months!I would not recommend these to anyone who needs a reliable headset, or someone who does not want to repurchase every 2-3 months."
2,Mic stopped working,"Like another reviewer, the mic stopped working for me after a few months (using Vista, but also tried it on Linux). Otherwise it was cool; I like the flexibility of the mic's extension and the comfort of the overall piece."
3,Broke after 3 months.,I bought two of these headsets since they were 15.00 dollars each one. The left side broke while i was adjusting my headphones. No hard force or anything just came loose and broke. It seems to be a common thing. Im gonna splurge and get me a plantronic set.
3,Good for phone...terrible for music.,"I recently got these, with the primary intention of using them for VOIP. In that regard, they work quite well. The mic is decent quality, and the headset (although a bit heavy) seems well made. However, I would advise just forgoing the AC 401, saving a few bucks, and getting the AC 201 instead. I ""upgraded"" to the 401 because it was advertised as having bigger drivers, so I thought maybe I could use these stereo headset for the music listening on the PC as well. Not a chance. High end is almost non-existent on them, and music is really, really muddy. Don't even measure up to a $6 pair of Sony or Panasonic cheapies, which is quite surprising. I didn't expect them to match the old Sennheisers that I use for the PC, but thought they would be a good bit better for music than they have turned out to be. Like I said, they work fine for voice applications, but for anything requiring any reasonable dynamic range forget about it."
3,moderate cheap,"Well I am disappointed, what sucks in it is the mic, sometimes works decent sometimes the called cant here me when I talk, specially with some messengers programs, and to be honest I wont recommended, just add extra money and buy something better than this headset"
3,OK as a placeholder,"I've used this headset for a year and a half. I game a lot, work on my computer all day and nights, listen to music, etc.The sound quality is good: no buzzing or high pitches.The microphone quality is very poor: People I talk to complain they can't hear me and sound is latent.It's durable, yet the headset pushes down on my ears and after 2-3 hours they hurt bad.Also, ear pads are made out of material, so they build up dust, wax and lint. You can clean with a lint remover.I would get this headset if you don't have anything else and need a headset and mic. fast and are worried about price."
3,good but messed with audio,"Good headphones and clear, but when you plug them into the computer it automatically installed all the drivers it needs but changes the audionsettings so when you unplug the headphones you have to go in and manually change them back every time you unplug them."
2,Whisper quiet,Tried this due to the low price unfortunately no one could hear me well. Tried on computer and telephone. Waste of money for me.
2,"Brittle jack, be careful.","My son has been using this headset without any problems on his desktop computer for about 6 months. Recently he took if along for a road trip to use it with his iPad. I did not notice any specific rough handling but he suddenly realized the smallest portion of the jack broke and got lodged in the iPad. There was no way it could be dislodged until we got home, after a lot of effort with pins and tweezers. Recommend the headset for more domestic use instead of rougher handling with portable electronics."
2,Not long lasting,"I got this for online classes last summer. It seems pretty decent, and worked very well. The sound was nice and the microphone was great to have. My problem comes in the quality. I went to unplug it a few weeks ago, and the wire in the headphones snapped. I didn't yank it or tug at it too tough, it just came right out. I was trying to splice that wire back together, and the rubber around the input just started to crumble. I don't think they all just fall apart like that, but I will be spending a bit more to get a better one that will hopefully last more than 5 months."
2,Go by Brand,"I have purchase it and it did work fine for 3 months than mic has started problem, after some time left side earphone did not work at all. I gave two star because sound quality was really good. Product could have designed in way that gives long lasting life of headphone.My advice to go with brand name where you have to pay few extra bugs but product stay there until it worth."
2,Painfully tight,"While the sound with these headphones is fine, they hurt so much to wear, and I do not have a big head. They fit like a vise on my head and ears, w/little flexibility. Bought sets for myself and my 11-yr old daughter and neither of us can wear them for more than a few minute without pain. Would not buy again."
3,Does not work with Macintosh,"Unfortunately, it does not work with a Mac Book Pro (the black chicklet keys), since that has a line-in instead of a microphone input.I had read that it does not work with some netbooks and others, but I hadn't thought it applied to Macintosh computers.The Headphones work great and are comfortable. It is relatively stylish and very adjustable.Didn't have the chance to test out the microphone since it is not compatible with my computer.I am returning and getting the same brand but with a USB input."
2,Wal-mart grade headphones,"I got these and after a month of light use the mic crapped out. I troubleshot it and eventually came upon this piece of information at fixya.com""The issue lies in the glass fiber wire, the wire is coated with a conductive metal only a few microns thick.Simply put the headset is a poor production model, the use of glass fiber wire more often than not results in a short in the wiring. Thus the sound will come out of one side, not at all, etc.""Posted by avataraahrens on Jun 13, 2009These are wal-mart grade headphones: good enough to get by with until it breaks, which will likely happen shortly after purchasing it"
2,Not for computer use,I purchased to use with my Rosetta Stone software and it did not work with my PC. I could not get the mic to work on anything except my iPhone. Not something I would use while talking on my cell. I am not happy but I can not return.
4,Cyber Acoustic AC 401 headset,"Have had for about 6 months pleasantly surprised works very well with my Magic Jack, is comfortable to use for several hours, and not bad as a headphone. I have Sony, Yamaha, and Koss headsets so these actually are supperior to the Cyber Acoustics but because they are always next to my laptop they are the handiest go to set I use. The microphone works well no complaints there, the mute button does what its supposed to do & you can also adjust the volume. Will be purchasing another soon for another laptop. Very happy with the purchase you cant go wrong."
3,Documentary on International Spying in the 1940-70s,"This is a documentary on what real spys in the 1940-70s had to do to hide things, change identities easily, what they had to do on the job & risks, what gadgets they used, what spy equpiment was used back then, etc. Has even how they used civillians to set bombs in WWII in Europe. Some of the titles of the chapters include ""Tools of the Trade,"" ""Cloak & Dagger,"" and ""To Catch a Spy.""If you're into this, you'll love it, if not, I do enjoy learning, but since most of the guys talking were in the trade years ago (awesome you get first-hand information) & are in their 60-80s now, they talked a bit slow & some mumbled & the pace seem to drag on a bit."
4,Good,Good. Good. Good goood goood goood oggod ogood goood ogoodvo ogooosd good good good goood goood good ogggdd. Good good
5,Atec tuffy baseballs,"The ATEC Tuffy baseball is a very durable and consistant ball when used in an Iron mike or casey pro pitching machines, I have both. They were shipped in plain cardboard boxes, not the official atec labled boxes, but same product as the couple of dozen I already own.John"
1,Bad Buy.,"They should not promote ATEC Tuffy Regular Dimpled Baseball Dozen Box (Yellow)to be purchased with ATEC Jet Baseball Pitching Machine. because these balls are heavier than those that come with this machine, so you do not meet the objective, maquima not have the strength to deliver them. bad buy."
1,Disappointed grandson,These balls are heavier than the white dimpled ones that came with the pitching machine.Okay for ground balls.
5,Suprisingly Very Good!!!!,"I am by no means a Debbie Gibson fan, but this song is actually very good! Much better than anything else I've heard from her. Is a good pop/r&b song. Unfortunately, the single didn't get the airplay it deserved, I guess because DJ's didn't take the one time teen queen seriously. They didn't want to adknowledge the fact that she is now a grown woman and her music is more mature- not the bubblegum stuff she did in the 80's."
5,What if?,"What if one sunday a month for one hour you truly tried new things and expanded yourself? What if you made out with a man, if you are a man, or a woman, if you are a woman? What if you tried dance and gymnastics and art and theature and tennis and food and song from another culture? What if made some friends who looked very different from you? Then you would be becoming fully human. You would be filled with joy. This book takes you on such a journey, one sunday at a time."
4,Man's best blu ray's,How much more perfect could it get. These two movies are what every man should own. It's a great deal for the price. Buying them indiviually would cost twice as much. They come in with each having they're own blu ray case as they would off the shelf buying them individually. The only surprise to this was that I didn't realize Braveheart had such a nude scene in it. Always watched it on TV and this part was edited out. My bad for not doing more research on it.
5,EPIC LEGENDS INDEED,"Two good films in one package together,what a awesome deal! Mel Gibson & Russel Crowe,two great actors and two awesome oscar winning films! These kind of epic stories and films aren't made like they used to be before!"
3,Still not what it should be,"I have not watched Braveheart yet but I have to say it's a shame they did not give Gladiator the quality it deserves for such an epic. Don't get me wrong, most of the movie looks great but their are several scenes (mostly dark/low light conditions) where the faces look like paste. Maybe it's my eyes...I guess you have to see it for yourself and decide."
1,Received 2 of the older copies of Gladiator in a row,"Received 2 of the older copies of Gladiator in a row, and sent them back to Amazon for a refund. Boo to Paramount for putting out substandard product, and boo to Amazon for continuing to sell it. I think I'm going to pass on this deal."
2,Does not play in my blu ray player,"This blu ray did not play in my ps3. It shows that this blu ray comes under region A and cannot play in my player. IS there a way you could indicate which ones are region A only and which ones can play on all blu rays ? Will really help to chose correctly, specially for clients like me who do not reside in the United States."
4,2 for 1,Two good movies in one package. The Blu-ray conversion was great and I'm glad each move was packaged in its' own case. This was a great deal.
1,Doesn't work!!!!,"Unfortunately after waiting 3 weeks for these to deliver, they simply didn't work with my Sony BDP-S480 blu-ray player. This is the first time this has happened to my UK purchased player.I was a little skeptical that the delivery would arrive in tact (i live in Mauritius) but Amazon did well to get the package to me without blemish.These are old movies, I just wanted a blu-ray version, but alas even at this sweet price it was too good to be true."
1,Disappointed,"I have only watched part of Braveheart, but I was extremely disappointed...during the middle of the film the audio did not match the video, that is there was a significant delay between their mouths moving and the delivery of the audio track. Wow, this doesn't happen even with my cheap regular dvd movies...and these are blu-ray...what's up?!"
4,What it is...,This product is a pillow/ stuffed toy. It is a very good looking and good quality item.
2,Real cheap and Cheap for a reason :p,Real cheap and Cheap for a reason :p I had a lot of trouble with the cables pausing the action to my tv and at times would freeze for several seconds
5,Omni Trio - Haunted Science,"A slightly mixed bag here, but several tracks make the purchase worthy. The opening tracks lean towards a cool jazz feel, tracks are kept clean with good production, even if there is not much going on sometimes. tracks 4-7 highlight a more melencholy sound, with heavy atmospheres and tangible mood, this was my favorite part of the cd.. and indeed some of the best work in Rob's catalog. The tones are at times almost reminicent of ""Orbital"" during 'the box' period.. and the mood conveyed is almost the same. Recomended."
3,NOT the Mitsubishi Car Commercial Tune,"Ok just to clarify... This is NOT the Mitsubishi Car commercial song. That particular song is Days Go By - Dirty Vegas..I bought Digital Allies thinking it was the song from Mitsubishi, it's great dance music thankfully and I'd never heard it before so I'm keeping it."
1,Not the Mitsubishi Car Commercial Song,"If you are looking for the song in the Mitsubishi car commercial, this is NOT it. Sheila Bee's review led me astry and I bought the CD. It's not even close. The mixes use the same generic club beat with the unfortunate addition of a lead vocalist(?) whose voice is just too grating.Does anyone know the REAL Mitubishi car commercial song?"
4,keep it spinn',"this single has a WOW expericence, it hit home and digital allies has my best wishes with them."
3,Mitsubishi Car Commercial Song,"There are several, but the one that started it all of course was ""Start the Commotion"" by the Wise Guys, to clarify."
4,"Great dance music, I love it!","I don't think it sounds like Neil Diamond in my opinion. I first found out about this song on the Mitsubishi (?) car commercial. And the music stores can't seem to get it in, or they can't even find it in their computer, so I had to order it here. That's okay though I like getting stuff in the mail. It is great dance music like Alice Deejay and Eiffel 65. I hope these guys make a full CD!"
4,enjoyable reading,"My daughter has read almost all of the Bailey Schoolseries. She says that this is not her favorite Bailey School Kidsbook, but she liked it. The Bailey School Kids series is a great way for parents to get reluctant readers to enjoy reading. You may find your child begging you to buy another one, as I did."
1,Booring,This is as fun as waiting for your car to be repaired. I could not get through a whole hand.
3,Could be better,"There's not much in the way of poker for the wii. For some reason, there was no battle for the bracelets on the wii but there was for the DS.Anyway, you can create your player, with a limited number of features.There's a bunch of unlockable features as well, but these are not necessary to play the game. The difficulty level is decent.My major complaint is that the game is slow. When the action is to you, and you fold, it takes some time for the betting to progress or give you the option to skip. You can always skip the computer players, but it lags when it's your turn.The graphics are okay. It was worth the $19 I paid for it. But I wouldn't have paid anymore for it. There's minimal uniqueness to game play with the wii-mote and nunchuk, but it's not necessary.I hope the next entry makes it onto the wii."
2,World Series of Poker --Boring,This is a avery boring game and I gave it away after one session of game play.
5,Lan card for HP printer,This solve my problem and at a great price. I was very pleased with the price and we were up and running in no time.
2,could have been more useful if...,"I've used this several times over the years, but frequently I am frustrated that there are very few of the most needed poses, such as clothed people standing, walking and sitting. I mean the real basic stuff, without too much gestural attitude. The nudes section of the book is well done, but in the clothed figures section, there's too much space wasted on gimmicky poses like ""Gangster with Violin Case"" and ""French Maid Dusting"". Also, some of the dark-clothed figures have so little detail showing, they might as well be black silhouettes. I think they should have concentrated more on making this a useful tool for illustrators and artists and less on making it ""entertaining"". Sometimes I want to throw it out in disgust, but you never know, I might need a photo of a ""Vicar Asleep In a Rocking Chair""."
4,Ali Bonnar,"I think the erika doll is beatiful, but her voice sort of wasnot as pretty as Annliese's. But this doll would be recomandedto any little girl. It's the second-prettiest one.;-)Erika is just a wonderful doll and I love her cat, Wolfie."
3,Cute Doll - Hard to Dress,"My daughter plays with this item a lot. The duet Erika sings with Annaliese is just darling, but she's cute without Annaliese too. One draw back - The clothes are difficult to remove & put on for tiny hands."
5,OH MY GOSH,she is the best doll ever.her hair is so silkey and she is dressed just like she was in the movie. im not trying to bragbut have both familys erika and king dom and but i had to useodette from swan lake to be to be the the princess and i usedken from the cali girl collection and dress him in juilansoutfit. well any way erikas two songs don't get annoying at allshe sings im just like you and the cats mewow. i tollaley recamed this doll .
3,So Pretty,I bought this one as a gift also.Very well made and oh so pretty.I was not disappointed in anything.
4,A little girl's dream,I got this doll a while ago and bought both of them: Anneliese and Erika thinking I would keep Erika for myself. WRONG my daughter wants Erika for Christmas! Good thing I already bought them both at the same time. So anyone who's interested in either doll for a small child be sure to go ahead and get BOTH since it is popular in the small girl child range.I think I'll get another Erika for myself. ;^)
5,"Overall pleased, but...",I got these because my two girls are new to Barbie and loved this movie. Much anticipation of these toys. I love them. They are beautiful dolls and well made. I don't like the fact that barbies come with so many miniscule pieces. And they sing well but getting them to sing together is very difficult. You have to press the buttons at the EXACT SAME time. Was hard for me to do it but having one girl each holding a doll trying to time it right? forget it. They still love them. I highly recommend for any Princess lovers.
1,it will die in 3 months,"i bought it august, now november, it's dead. DO NOT BUY!!! save your money, it just does not work anymore. it is very hard to keep the thing working with AAA batteries, they should have designed it to work with PSP battery."
2,good then bad,"I have a dock for my PSP and so I take the base off a lot. It WAS a really good product, but then the jack just fell off one day when I was taking it off. we haven't been able to fix it at all so it was now a waste of money."
1,It wont work on the PSP-3001,When I got the product I try to put it on my PSP-3001 and the product would not line up. I was reading some of the reviews this product looks like it only works on the PSP-1001 only I'm sure it works great for the that model but the newer ones don't waste your money or time. Hope someone has the transmitter for the 2001 and 3001 I would really like one. Word of advise do you research before ordering make sure the product that your ordering works with the item that your going to use it on.
4,Pretty nice pretty nice (needs battery),"Amazon said ""Powered from the PSP - needs no batteries"".. that is false, it needs 2 AAA battery so its not a very big deal if you have rechargeable battery. Product is pretty good, sound is quite clear, a little bit of static here and there but well worth it for the price.($10)"
1,Does not fit,This product does not fit the new slim PSP. Wish I had know this before I bought it. I did not see this info listed anywhere. So beware.
2,Incomplete Euro Cinema,"This proves that director's-cinema is as bad as actor's-theater.Actor's theater is when you have no director but the actors just ad-lib around the stage. Director's cinema is when the story is incomplete lacking a flow-of-complexity so the director looks for angles-&-emphasis to try to make ""something"" happen.What made the TV show ""Twilight Zone"" so great was the complete short stories played out in 20 minutes. What makes this poor are the single or double idea stories without a sense of finish and completeness except maybe at the most childish intellectual level."
5,A must see---In My Room: The Inner Life of Teen Girls,"Focusing intently, and poetically, on three very different adolescent girls, In My Room is a poignant and intensely personal portrayal of the challenges and triumphs of growing up female in suburban America. The filmmaker, Brijetta Hall, asked these teenagers to talk about their experiences of home, school, peers, and coming of age while situated in their own bedrooms. Hall's rendering of their reflections is respectful, revealing, disconcerting, and honestly exhilarating, because the girls present themselves as motivated, intelligent, confused, imperfect, complex, changing, and thus genuinely ""real."" If you are ready to listen to, learn from, and understand some teenage girls, see this film.J. Fisherkeller, Ph.D."
5,A Pima Community College Student,"You Can't Buy a Dinosaur with a Dime, tells the story of a boy who wants to buy a toy dinosaur but has to earn enough money to buy it. It takes the reader through the coming and going of his money as he works toward his goal of buying this dinosaur.This book would be a great introductory book for such math concepts as addition, subtraction, multiplication, money and decimals. It also exemplifies the importance of responsibility and hard work. Along with its concepts, You Can't Buy a Dinosaur with a Dime, provides several little activities that a teacher can do to coincide with the book. The children really responded to the illustrations in the book because of their vibrant colors. They also liked the money talk because some of them had piggy banks so they could relate to the boy in the story. When I become a teacher, I will definitely reference this book when I teach these math concepts."
3,This explains it all...,"This book was more of an informational book becasue it explained the reason as to why the Fier family is cursed. I didn't really enjoy this book becasue the plot was boring and it was set too far back in the past for me. I thought how Brianna betrayed Fieran was just plain wrong. He trusted her with all his heart and she just got him killed. So much for trust. I would recommed this book to all Fear Street readers, because it explains the whole reason as to why the Fear family is cursed.(I would also recommend ""Awaking Evil"" by R.L. Stine)"
1,Sign Of Fear,"Discovering the ancient Fear amulet, Christina, a young servant girl, finds her fate linked to the revenge-driven warrior Fieran, the amulet's creator, who cursed the Fear family centuries earlier.This book could have been improved. I found the book hard to cope with."
2,Better Off Dead!,I picked up this book thinking is going to be more interesting this book was more fiction than real. I was reading this book for my English class period 4 this book was easy to read and easy to understand. I think people should read it if they like fiction.
5,Best American poet since Gary Snyder,"I found this book in a garbage heap behind the Georgetown University library. I started reading it and was totally blown away. After two years, I still carry it around and read it on the DC Metro. Perhaps I love it so much because Daly's just as screwed up as I am. What kind of feeling do I get from reading his poetry? I'd compare it the prose of Henry Miller or the lyrics and music of John Prine. If Bob Dylan actually wrote poetry (as opposed to song lyrics - big difference), his poems would be like Daly's. If I were shipwrecked on a desert island with two books of poetry, I'd want one of Gary Snyder's collections and this small masterpiece."
1,Arrested adolescence,"Self pitying, drunken ramblings.No genius. No insight. No fun.This is not pilosophy, not poetry.Save your money."
5,awesome little mouse,"great compact design, good battery life, and i like the little compartment for the usb transmitter. the solid state scroll button is great too"
5,Awesome!,"Hands-down, the best wireless optical mouse I have ever purchased. Great size, style and functionality. I couldn't be happier with this product."
2,"fancy idea of solid state scroll panel, but it doesn't work well","I like new and good idea. But this solid state scroll panel thing is just a fancy idea which doesn't work very well. For vertical scrolling, you need to move your finger back and forth carefully, otherwise, you don't know whether you are scrolling up or down. This really takes away my concentration. Side scrolling is not always working. Because this is a small mouse, the 7 degree expendable chassis doesn't fit my hand, even though I have a small hand.There is something I like. The 2.4GHz micro-receiver is reliable. It also fits inside the mouse for storage. Both are a plus for travelling. I also like the battery-saving switch. However, I have no idea about battery life for this mouse."
1,A piece of junk,"This is one of the worst designed products I've ever bought. It comes packaged in incredibly thick plastic that's virtually impossible to open by any means, including a razor or a knife, and by the time you mangled it enought to manage to get it open, you'll probably never be able to return it. The side scrolling doesn't work at all. The ""wheel"" is a immobile piece of plasic that if you rest your middle finger against (which is almost impossible not to do) automatically starts scrolling wildly, uncontrollably. Meanwhile it's almost impossible to intentionally scroll in a controlled manner. Buy *any* mouse but this!!!"
3,"Not a bad mouse, but...","I bought the Logitech V500 about a year ago. Works fine, is convenient for travel as it collapses and stores away in its little nylon pouch. The down side, about three months after my initial purchase the inner lining (which is made of plastic) of the aluminum battery bay door started to crumble and flake off into little pieces. By another three months the lining was almost gone. Currently I use tape to hold the door in place as part of the plastic inner linig also formed the catch for the door. That's the only negative experience I have had with the V500.I've had Logitech mice before, this is the first one that disapointed me."
2,definitely not worth my $$$,"The touch sensitive wheel is a joke... not having the tactile feedback is a big disappointment for me. I like the size, but too flat/slim to provide ergonomics. I have to pinch the mouse in order to move it around and as a result, my fingers and wrist were hurting!! I ended up taking it back to OfficeDepot and got a Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse for less than $30. It only uses 1 AA unlike logitech's 2 AAA(costly) and very much more comfortable. I forgot to mention... When i bought the logitech mouse, it was missing the receiver that it was supposed to come with!! Unbelievable... Went back and got another one that did have it. This is all I have to say,,, I wouldn't buy it if I were you :)"
3,"Attractive mouse, cursor precision not on par with other mice","I purchased this mouse primarily because of the new ""touch-sensitive"" scrolling and as far as scrolling is involved, this mouse is fun and easy to use. However, after using the mouse for about 10 minutes or so, I began noticing that the mouse cursor movement was not as accurate as other ""wireless"" mice, such as the Logitech MX700. Testing out the V500's accuracy with Yahoo Pool, it was fustratingly difficult getting the mouse to move exactly where you wanted it to move.All in all, I would wait until the price drops lower than $40 on this mouse as the only real innovative feature it has is the scroll pad. If you really dislike using a regular scroll wheel, you might want to give this mouse a try. Otherwise, I would stick with the old MX700 or regular corded mice as the lack of accuracy with the V500 becomes increasingly annoying over time."
4,James Bond wants a mouse like this!,"This is the ultimate portable wireless mouse! Looks killer next to a shiny silver Mac Powerbook. Nice wide top surface feels great in my hand (unlike some mini laptop mice). The touch sensitive scroll ""wheel"" is pretty slick. However, horizontal scrolling has very little real world usefulness (more of a marketing feature). Imagine trying to scroll your finger across a panel 1/2 the width of a dime and you'll get the picture. Normal vertical scrolling works fantastically. The collapsible design adds to the cool ""007 Gadget"" look."
3,Logitech V500 Cordless optical notebook mouse,"I like the self-containded USB transmitter and the fact that this mouse turns off when you collapse it. The ""touch sensitive"" center instead of a genuine scroll wheel does not work too well for me, but maybe I'll get used to it.This mouse is certainly more suited to traveling than the cordless mouse it replaced!"
4,Wonderful add-on to laptop,"Works well with my laptop. Recommend this relatively inexpensive item as a wonderful add-on to the laptop, especially for those who have difficulty with the laptop touchpad."
5,Excellent Digital Card,I have at least 10 of these digital cards. I have several other that are more GB's but these work well for what I need.
2,Slow,"The card was only $9, however the time it takes to process the image to return in the LCD monitor is very slow...and if I take several shots in a row -- the wait is painful."
4,Very nice transaction.,"A fair price for the 1GB SD card & good packaging. If the card was shipped the following day, instead of taking 3 days to ship, I'd have given the deal 5 stars. Over-all, I'm happy with the purchase. Thank you."
5,This is a real Secure Digital Card,"I bought this SD Card, and a think this is the best. I can't believe that this small thing can record until 1200 pictures."
4,Good for Ipaq,"Since HP failed to test a 2 GB SD card for its iPaq rx 1950, I purchased this 1 GB for it. It works very well and has expanded the storage capacity of the iPaq. I've also tested it on a digital camera and it works equally well there."
5,Want to go Amazon again,I am using it for 1 month.. It was delivered on the right time and till date have not got any problem in the product..Thanks to amazon..
4,1 GB Secure Digital Card,"I've tried the card and pictures seem to be saved in a very good resolution. I haven't printed images, though.So far I like this card."
5,Excellent Storage Card For My Casio Camera,The SanDisk 1 GB SD card worked perfectly and is fast enough that I did not have any problems with using it for my Casio camera. I read one review on this card when the reviewer was unhappy because his card would only hold a small number of files which was not nearly the capacity of the card. The SD card functions like a removeable hard drive. The root directory of a hard drive will only allow a limited number of files. You have to create at least one folder on the SD card and that folder will allow the entire capacity of the card to be stored in it.
5,Great Cost for Amazing Product!!!!,"I recently bought this product online for only $22.48 including S&H and so far, I have been extremely pleased with it. I bought it for my Nikon CoolPix L3 camera and have been able to take hundred's of pictures using it. The price online is definately a lot cheaper than the in-store price. Stores like Walmart and Best Buy sell this product anywhere from $35-50, so buying it online is probably the best way to go."
3,Six months then KAPUT,"This card worked fine in an MP3 player for about six months of light use and then suddenly stopped working--my MP3 player could no longer recognize it, and when I looked on a computer I could no longer see the music files which had been on the card (and which were still there somewhere, according to the amount of used space on the card). Also could not reformat.I actually think that for this card to stop working after six months of light use to call for a two star rating, but I guess that my expecations for reliability have been lowered for all manner of portable consumer electronics.TMR"
5,Works and am so glad to find this card for my fav HP camera,"This was just the SD card I was looking for for my old HP digital camera. I love my camera and have no plans to give it up, although my kids would like a new one, as the camera works fine. The only problem is finding SD cards to use and fortunately Amazon had just what I needed.BTW the image with the ad copy is incorrect. You will receive the 1 G SD card not the 2 G card as shown."
5,Very good performance for bargain price,"I sometimes wonder if I should get one of the faster cards (Ultra II, etc) but this card works so quickly in my camera (Canon PowerShot 700is) that I can't imagine that it would be worth the extra money for the faster card. I'm completely satisfied with this card."
5,SanDisk SDSDB-1024-A10 1 GB,Product works well and the price was fantastic! I will buy another SanDisk product without considering any others. DaveC
5,Works fine!,"I'm not a techie, but I have one of these I've used in a digital camera for over a year, and it works great.Just ordered my second one for another device."
1,wrong card,"The amazon site brought up this card for accessories for my Canon rebel XT digital camera. It is the wrong disc. Because I opened it, their vendor , Adorama, would not exchange it. I never would have bought it if it hadn't come up on their site. If I go now the right card does come up, but something I did atthe time directed me to this card. It was not clear that for my large purchase order that they were splitting my order to three vendors (part of that hidden price gig they've got going on) until you go to summarize the order for putting your charge number in. By that time, I'd spent enough time with the whole thing,though I didn't kknow anything about the other vendors. I would have been better off getting accessories like memory cards locally. I guess I'll have to sell it on eBay. I'm quite discouraged with the Amazon process for this type of purchase. Next time I'll stick to books."
1,one star for the seller BlueProton:,I bought this from this company trying to save myself some extra cash. Well you do get what you pay for. This SD card is a piece of garbage. Enough said. Save yourself the hassle atleast with this seller.
5,excelent,Thank's a lot for your response and to attend my petition. I receive all of my money for the product which never receive.THANK'S.
2,Late Delivery,"I had a problem with the rebate and late delivery. So, don't expect to get it ontime even you pay for the delivery cost."
2,Great card but possible errors (speed problems) with Memory Card Error and or Card Locked,"1GB card. Great. The problem is that it may not work with new Canon models like the Canon PowerShot S2 IS by giving a Memory Card Error and or Card Locked! error even though the card is unlocked. Sometimes you might not even be allowed to format this card in the camera. This may be due to some cards being faulty but it appears that many users are suggesting that the problem has to do also with the card speed and new Canon cameras. The only solution is to take the memory card back and get another brand. I got this card, it gave me the above errors. I got a different 1GB model (a 150X speed one) and it worked on the Canon Powershot S2 IS, no problem."
5,Speed Good,I heard about speed being a problem and some off-brands not working as expected. In my cannon the speed seems to not be a factor and I can take shots pretty fast.Overall I would recommend this and Amazon and stay away form Ebay for this type of electronics.
3,"Good product, less than stellar seller","I received this just in the knick of time for vacation. I have 125 photos stored on it and counting. It seems to be working just fine!My problem is with the seller. I gave a somewhat negative review (3 out of 5 stars) in the seller's feedback section on Amazon due to the fact that the item arrived several days late. It was to arrive between June 14 - 17th, per Amazon's shipping confirmation info. I did not receive it until June 19th - hours before leaving for vacation. The seller did refund expedited shipping costs, but only after blaming UPS and Amazon, and after 1 1/2 hours of phone calls and emails. To top it off, after the seller saw my feedback, they called me and offered to give me $5 to remove the review. Excuse me - I'm not so greedy that I'll take down my honest opinion for the equivalent of 2 lattes!! Obviously I left my feedback up. I think it's ridiculous that they offer money to essentially bribe people to be dishonest about the service received."
3,Sandisk 1 gig. SD memory Card,"I purchased this when the price was right. The cost of these SD memory cards have since come down considerably. I find this card works just fine in my digital camera. Although other manufacturers advertise fast speed memory for cameras, I doubt that anyone needs faster speed than this Sandisk SD memory card delivers. I marvel at this modern technolgy...sure beats the old negative photos."
2,problems with lock tab,"When using this SD card, the units would often say the card was locked even when the switch was clearly not locked."
3,Not applicable,This product was purchased to use with small camera sold by QVC. The QVC product was a bad product so never had a chance to use the SanDisk. I have used many other SanDisk products never had a problem with any of them.Iknow of no reason to think this product is ANYTHING but good.
3,"The picture shows two two, but it says one one GB!",The picture show two 2 GB memory cards but the words say a single 1 GB memory card. What is it really?
4,Just fine,"This product serves our purpose, holds lots of photos. The only complaint I have is that it's a bit slow, so taking photos of kids is tough."
4,good card 16x,"got three for 96 from dell on a price mistake. great cards, not very fast but good for my use in a RAVE-MP 256 player. I checked the speed on this, it is 16x, good enough for most uses."
3,not as described,"The manufacture states ""The SD Card can be used in a variety of digital products"" ... not so. I had to return mine because i have a Fuji, this card is twice the size,"
4,San Disk purchase,"Product was as advertised and received in good condition and in a timely manner, but the shipping charges were outrageous for two little SD disks. I can only assume that the shipping charges are used to make up for the low advertised selling price. This makes comparison shopping a farce without prior knowledge of the shipping charges."
4,I Wish I Went Bigger...,"I love my memory card because I use it for my digetal camera and it works wonderfully. However, I do wish I would've gotten a bigger memory card...being the technological ignorant person I am, I decided to go for the smallest one...but I advise people to buy the 2GB memory card because it simply holds more."
1,okay,The memory card works but it gives my computer fits...locks it up.Seems to have to be inserted just right...I would not purchase another from this manufacturer.
5,Great memory company,"While there are plenty of other cheap memory manufacturers, you can't beat the reliability and speed of Sandisk."
5,"good product, great value","I bought it mainly for my gps.. so far so good, great speed no delay while using the gps.. You can't go wrong with SanDisk products."
3,Was not compatible.,I have an old mp3 player and unfortunately the memory card was not compatible with my device. Amazon was great about sending a replacement and then accepting both disks as a return when I found out that there was just a compatability issue.Technical service with sanDisk was another story. they make you sign up for some weird e-box thing and then it takes them forever to evaluate the problem. It was a waste of time.FYI: A cheaper Kingston card did work for my old (2002) mp3 player.
1,Not happy!,The ad said this would work in any digital camera. Not true. I have a basic Olympus and it doesn't fit. That's frustrating because now I have to box it up to return and that's a hassle. I should have just gone in person and I would've known.
1,NEVER COME,"SORRY , BUT I HAVE A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS SHOPPING , THAT NEVER COME TO MY COURRIER,,"
4,Good Deal... Theoretically...,"The product itself is great it is awesome having 1GB of portable memory. I use it for my V36 viewsonic PDA and I can store several MP3's along with storing my other data such as pictures, notes, and Word documents. I also use it with my small SD card reader and so it works great as thumb drive as well. The only reason I give it a 4 is because the SanDisk lost the UPC that I sent in with the rebate and so I didn't really save that much. Normally I keep copies of the rebates and this one I didn't...that's a lesson to be learned. So for such a high rated company that was a bunch of crap. Other than that, the product itself is great, just remember to keep a copy of your UPC if you send it in for rebates."
5,GREAT SD CARD,"It works great in my canon digital camcorder. It allows many, many pictures to be taken with in the still mode."
2,Buy at your own risk,"On the surface, this seems to be a really good product, but I had something that I just wanted to share with you guys. I bought a 1.0 GB card to use in a SanDisk MP3 player and it has given me endless fits. The problem is this - I was loading the music files onto my card and one day an error message pops up that says the file cannot be created. Thing is, I only took up about 300 MB on a 1 GB card. It doesn't say it's full, it just says the file cannot be created. I took it to the store and even tried a different computer, but to no avail. The guys at the store said I might have a bad card. Now I have to pick and choose what I want on there, even though I've used less than a third of the available space. For all I know, my card may be one out of a million; maybe not. It's just frustrating to shell out 90 dollars for a product and only be able to use 30 dollars worth of it. Buyer beware."
4,San Disk,Use plenty of them and have been happy with them. Think I have at least 15 of them already so am a fan
5,Yes I liked,Ordering online I was not sure? Turned out to be a great deal. Have not had any problems with Product. Would buy again
2,Missing one SD card in package,"I thought the package was supposed to contain two SD cards, but there was only one. What is the deal?"
3,Good product,These SC cards get the job done. Not the best SD card in the market but will definetly solve an emergency.
2,My fault,Well here is the problem i have Most people look at the picture not the discription when i got my pacage It was a single 1 gig sd card not 2 2 gig cards i ordered
5,Awesome card,"I got it for my Nikon coolpix P2 and I must say that I'm really happy with my choice. The price for 1GB card was low and even though the shipment rate was annoying (around 8$) the company explained it well in their website by increasing the rate for low items bu then other things costs less, fact that didn't affected much on the total price. It was around 30$, just for compare, 512MB, costs arounfd the same price in stores. The shipment was quick. Recommended!"
2,Problems with card.,"The first time I used the card in a digital camera, it corrupted the last half of the images. It then intermittently failed. When I emailed customer support about an RMA number, they said to format the card which I did. It seems to be ok now, but I would be a little hesitant about buying another."
5,"Super capacity, great price","This card replaced a 16mb that came with a camera. Now this camera can take over 1,000 pictures instead of 24."
4,perfect one,"i bought 3 SanDisk SDSDB-1024-A10 1 GB Secure Digital Card (Retail Package, and i use for everything i can use like a flash memory i dont need care my pc everywhere, photos, it is not cd or dvd its better one its little piese of world u can care everywhere."
1,Be Careful! Cards Not Always As Advertised!,"I purchased what I thought was a 2-pack set of 1GB Sandisk SD cards in a retail package from Rhino Tech. What I received were two white 1GB SD cards that say ""Sandisk for Wii"" printed on them. Both cards were in plastic cases loose inside the shipping pouch. This is NOT what was advertised and so I complained to the dealer via Amazon. I asked for my money back plus the overpriced shipping costs. I am happy to report I was given a full refund with no questions asked and they took responsibility for sending me a product that was not as promised. My advice to others looking to buy memory cards is be careful, shop around, and make sure you get what you are paying for. Lots of counterfeits around."
4,Valued Seller,The price was great on the SanDisk 1 GB. I had called inquiring about the delivery date and spoke to a PR person that explained everything in detail. Would buy from them again. So far the product is working great.
4,"Solid card, a bit slow","Bought this for my digital camera. Felt like it was worth it to go with the 1GB and there is no question that if you are using a 5Megapixel + camera, you need a large card. Feel like the data transfer is a bit slow, but overall I'm very happy."
5,"Great card , no issues with Palm Treo650",This card has worked flawlessly with a Palm Treo650 and is a great value. I use it to store mp3s and have zero issues and will buy another soon. I would suggest using a USB card reader/writer from your PC to load the card files - such as the SanDisk MobileMate.
5,Perfect!,"As technology moves forward, it seems to get harder to find what we need at local stores. They move out or discontinue the older stock to make room for the new. Thats whats so great about shopping on line. I drove around for a week looking for this item to no avail. Went on line and there it was. I could have saved time and gas if I'd shopped here first. I needed this memory card for my digital camera and found many choices on Amazon.com. Ordered it and had it in the camera in just over a week. The card is brand new. Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect!"
5,Great for Digital cameras.,"I use this SanDisk SDSDB-1024-A10 1 GB Secure Digital Card for my digital camera; I have a Canon A 620 Power Shot; which is 7.1 Mega pixels. I can store (shoot) 515 pictures of the highest quality, on the card. So far its excellent, no problems at all; speed seems good, Picture quality and reliability excellent. I have Video capability on the camera ,but I don't use it, I have a Mini DV camcorder I use for shooting Video. So I can't commit on video storage on the card. I have one other 1 Gig Card, from SanDisk-slighty higer quality, and with these two cards, its all I need for vacations, family pics etc.,"
3,"Good for still photos, not so much for video.","This card works great with my S2 IS for stills but not so much for movies at the highest resolution. The card needs to support ~9 MB/sec for that and this one doesn't. As a result, the videos are not as clear as they should be. The movie sometimes stops, as if a frame is missing and the resolution is not good. I won't recommned this if you plan to take videos. I am buying a Sandisk Ultra II card now."
2,Mine seems faulty.,"I bought one of these from my local Fry's Electronics brand new. It seemed like a great deal with the price and all, but as I filled my card up with data, it seems to have some defective areas that corrupt my data. I think I'm going to have to try to get a replacement.This corruption happens both when I'm using it on my PC with a USB SD Card reader I got from OfficeMax or on my Sharp Zaurus SL-5600 PDA. I don't remember my old 128MB Kingston SD Card having any trouble like this."
1,product I paid for,I sent numerous E Mails and did not even get one reply from the vendor.I paid for the item but have never recieved it.Very poor show. Will not be giving my money away again. Thanks Eric a PENSIONER.
4,Undersized.,"These mailers are good to use even though they are a little smaller than some of the others out there.There was no brand name on them,now I use a brand name that easily fits all my movies and games."
2,Too Small,"I purchased these to send DVDs in the mail and the envelopes are too small. I have used many other brands that leave more than enough room, but these are so tight I can barely fit a DVD in it without almost damaging the case."
2,Not very good mailers,"These were thin and the bubbles were not very thick, so they didn't protect the item in the bag very well. This required me to wrap everything again in bubble wrap, which defeats the whole purpose of a bubble mailer.On the bright side, they were very light, so they didn't add much to the mailing cost. I would have preferred they weighed more and protected better.I will not be repurchasing these mailers."
4,avant garde noise,"l love this Cd. I'm really not too familiar with this band, but this album is quite incredible. It reminded me of a mixture of early Swans with a splash of Godflesh. This is a re-release through Release records and hopefully they will continue to release some of their other albums since almost all of them are out of print. Their music is a mixture of harsh electronics, bass heavy beats, and trumpets and horns a-la Laibach here and there. The vocals range from whispering to off-tone clear but always within the limits. If you like the bands that l mentioned above, this is a guarantee thrill. enjoy the twisted british ride."
4,All that's fit to print,"The disadvantage of the daily newspaper is that even though it informs us about our neighbors and community members, it filters out the emotions and experiences that make those people who they are. Pat Rushin's stories put faces and feelings to the people who we read about everyday. By doing so, Rushin shows us how close we are to them in our goals, desires, and fears.Unfortunately, Rushin's characters cannot communicate those goals, desires, and fears to their parents and lovers. The communication gap between generations and sexes only causes more frustation, stress, and problems for everyone. And yet everyone keeps trying and keeps looking for solutions. It shows that Rushin still has hope in the world, even after reading the newspaper."

4,Review of CD,The music on this CD is very enjoyable. I have listened to it several times already. The only downside is an apparent mislabelling of the content. The title of each band is displayed on my PC when I play this CD. The titles thus displayed are in a different order than the same titles on the CD jacket. I wonder which is correct?
5,Follow Roland and his band of misfits on their adventure...,"This series is incredible if you are into dark westerns. Roland, a gunslinger from a mythical world (think of ours, early 1900 technology minus the cars) is on an mission to find the dark tower as he believes the world is being torn apart by evil forces and only by making his way to the dark tower can he make right all that is going wrong. Along the way, Roland picks up a junkie, a cripple, and a little boy as companions on this adventure which make for an interesting set of characters. A must read, even if you are not into King's usual works.King has an interesting way of tying many of his other books into this series through minute little connections so if you do read King, you should see the connections."
2,Not quite Stephen Kingish enough,Losing interest in this series. Not the typical Stephen King fare. Characters are shallow story line doesn't progress with interest.
5,Dark Tower Boxed Set (Books 1-4),These books are in GREAT/MINT condition. Shipping time was VERY fast!! I will definitely order more books from this seller!! Thank you so much!
2,From promising to the absurd,"Really enjoyed the series early on as we delve in othe world of Roland, but then it reaches some strange places and it's hard to finish, in fact i couldn't...Lobstrosities? Crazy trains? Really?Would have been better off sticking with the original gritiness and not going to strange in my opinion."
1,Poor King work,"I've read many of his books, and apparently this series has a big following. For me, I found it hard to follow, drawn out with little action or purpose. True, the first few books were written very early in his career, so one can't expect it to be up to the quality of The Stand. I tried to get through it to get to the point, but just had to put it down at the third book. I don't recommend it."
3,The dark tower box set,The story of the dark tower is amazing but the print in the books are a bit small for my less than better eyes. I was a good deal and I'm glad I bought it.
2,Where are the rest?!!,It doesn't make sense for a series that has been out as long as the Dark Tower to not come in a full matching set. These were returned in hopes that they're going to be reprinted to ALL match sooner than later!
3,Mass market editions,It should be noted that this box set contains the first four books of the Dark Tower series in mass market paperback. The trade paperback editions contain about 10 or so full page illustrations and a different artist for each book save the first and last book those two books have illustrations by Michael Whelan which are excellent. The mass market editions do not contain any illustrations. I would say go for the trade paperback editions. If you don't care for the illustrations then you do save money with this box set although you can find good deals on the trade paperbacks in used condition.
4,dark tower,"the series starts off a little slow, the first book is rather confusing but from the last chapter onwards into the next books its addictive. great reads"
5,Life-changing!,"Without giving a synopsis of what the series is about, ""Dark Tower"" books are amazing. The first book was a little tough to get through since it seemed to be laying a lot of groundwork, but the second and third books began to flow much better. The final books were the ""page-turners"" to me that one of the reviewers on this site found them not to be. I have read the entire series about 10 times now and each time I read them, I pick up something new or understand something that was foreshadowed 5 books ago. It is an amazing piece of work and I highly recommend it. I was especially happy that these books did not involve a lot of the gore for which Stephen King is known- this is a highly imaginative and complex story."
5,Great!,I was very happy on getting this set. I bought it for my mother because she just loves Mr. Kings work. She loved each and everyone of these books. Highly recommend this to any Stephen King fans!
3,Not as advertised,"I knew going in that these were used and accepted that but the ad was somewhat misleading. It does include all the novels 1-4 of the boxed set but there was no box.The books were a little more ""used"" than on previous purchases from this seller but it was still a good value. The books arrived in the time frame advertised."
1,Abysmal claptrap!,"Don't buy this garbage, I implore you! The books are awesome, but you deserve better - and here's why! King revised the first book, i.e. changed the story. That means plot, characters, and the flow of the story. It's now a different book - I say find and read the original version.What's more, each book in this set contains a new introduction by the author. What's not mentioned is that each and every introduction is identical! All four books have the same introduction! Lazy and stupid, Mr. King!I love his writing, but tremble with rage at his shameless greed and lack of artistic integrity! Shame on you, you flim-flam artist!"
1,Cardboard Boots,"My wife bought these for me and they are absolute crap - the tongue digs into your foot and they cracked across the top almost immediately after they were out of the box. The leather used to make these boots is way too thin, of a low-quality and has the durability of dried out old cardboard. These look nice- but only on display, they are not meant to be worn or actually used."
4,My daughter loved it!,"For a younger child who is wild about Pokémon, this book is fun and confidence boosting. My daughter was able to read and figure out the puzzles by herself, with very little assistance, and she had fun doing it."
1,This book is a waste of time and money,This book is for little kids and its very stupid. The pictures stink. And the activites are so lame and easy. A pre schooler could probley figure it all out. They have stuff from mazes to connect the dots big whoop. Go find something better!
1,Buyer beware,I purchased this book through one of Amazon's distributors and paid $9.98. Unfortunatly the book arrived today and it is very thin and the price listed on the back of the book is only $3.95. This is a major scam!!!
1,Much Less Than One Star,"I bought this book on the basis of customer reviews. The reviewers must be very good friends of the author, or the author himself, although they were well written and his book was not. I just put it into the recycling. I can't imagine who I'd pass it on to. The writing is incredibly pedestrian, full of cliches -- but worse, the morality is that of a six year old -- eye for an eye. I'm half afraid the author will go after ME for writing this review -- but hey, save your money. Also -- I received an anonymous letter recommending this book. Obviously, the sender was afraid to reveal his/her identity as well! Anyone can write a book and anyone can publish -- buyer beware."
5,A very good collection,"Anderson's introduction and the first essay or two are worth the entire book.Some of the essays are tough to grasp, but French philosophers of the age have never been easy to figure out. The other contributions well make up for the ones that are difficult, but the difficult ones are important, too.This book is still one of the best discussions of postmodernism I've come across. The variety of contributors prevent any unilateral opinions about postmodernism, which is only fitting for postmodernity. It provides an excellent means of understanding current society and culture. After reading it, one will be much more able to recognize postmodern themes while reading current magazines, watching TV, or talking to others."
5,"The best introduction to postmodern culture, period.","Anderson's gift for clear expression of very complicated ideas is never better exemplified than in The Truth About the Truth. In my work as a futurist working with religious clients, I have never found a more useful book.In the end, this is not a book about philosophy, it is about the dreams, worries and struggles of real people who live in the real world(s) of today. If you want to understand people and cultures of the late twentieth/early twenty-first century, this is THE book to have."
1,Another (sorely) deficient computer book,"Pages are filled with cutesy commentary unrelated to the subject matter at hand, and subject matter (when the author finally gets around to it) is replete with vague and undefined references that beg instead of answering questions necessary to make the material useful. Don't buy this book expecting to get well thought out, helpful instruction, if you do you will be disappointed."
4,His first two albums on one CD,"B. B. King/ Singin' the Blues/The Blues: This CD has B. B. King's first two albums and they are terrific (if a bit dated). There are cuts on these albums that he Still performs. If you are looking for early B. B. King, this is the CD for you. However, if your new to B. B. King, I would recommend that you start with his great ""Live at the Regal"" album as the best from this CD is performed live in that classic album."
5,Best Place for Early King,"Outside of the first disc of the box set ""King of the Blues,"" this is the best single disc of early B.B. one can find. Many of his greatest songs are here:""Three O'Clock Blues,"" ""Everyday I Have the Blues,"" ""Please Love Me,"" and ""You Upset Me Baby."" As a singer and guitarist, King would later sound more sophisticated, but he would rarely ever sound as energetic and full of fire as he does on these essential recordings."
2,Skip to my Lou,"I got this system for christmas. I had a problem with cds skipping, which is really annoying, so, to say the least I am taking it back..."
2,two stars in generous,"unfortunatley we threw out the box so we are stuck with it. the sound quality is competely lacking. the volume goes from 1 to 50 but i have to put it at 35 before i even hear anything. at max volume it still sounds bad. the unit also emits a buzzing sound whenever it is turned on, which is really annoying. the antenna is awkward (old school pull up) and i cannot get one station in clearly, so the radio is completely useless to me. if you lose the remote you're out of luck; most functions are on it. i usually dont throw the box away immediately from anything i buy. but i had faith in the product that it would at least be halfway decent for what i paid. a disappointment and a lesson learned."
4,I like this writer a lot !!,I like this writer a lot !! Shannon McKenna has her own style when it comes to the romantic supsense genre. If you haven't had a chance to read any of her stories then this book will make a great one to begin with.
4,"Sex and a plot. Oh, my!","This book is entertaining because the author establishes a pattern of long, sizzling sex scenes followed by a return to a pretty good plot. After a while, you feel like one of Pavlov's dogs while anticipating the next hot scene. It's fun."
1,Ridiculous waste,"What a ridiculous waste of time and paper! This ""heroine"" who can only say ""Um, thanks"" and ""Oh Gee, I forgive you"" after being treated like trash for most of the book is insulting.The ""hero"" appears to have an IQ that is barely measurable. There appears to be only one thing he is capable of and we read about it over and over and over...Try Linda Howard or Anne Stuart and read something worthwhile"
4,Behind Closed Doors,"I wanted to try to read a different genre from the normal books I love to read and after researching on amazon and reading the reviews I decided to read this book by Shannon McKenna. I really liked this book and I hope that the other books in this series keeps getting better and better. The plot is interesting, the characters were twisted, troubled, with psychological issues but it worked! It's like a train wreck you know you shouldn't be looking but you can't help it. It certainly kept me wanting to find what happens next. So I look forward to reading more from this author. Hey it's just my opinion and you might not like it!"
4,"If you love Foster, you'll love McKenna!!","great book-Love all Lori Fosters books, I will now buy Shannon McKenna too. All keepers-especially of you like steamy books....looking forward to the next one."
5,"Hot, hot, hot!!!",I LOVED this book. It had hot sex and a great plot. Normally you can't get both. I first read her in All Through the Night. She doesn't have many books out and I heard her next one will be about Connor McCloud and Erin Riggs who were characters in Behind Closed Doors. I definitley recommend this book to anyone who loves hot romance!!
3,"Enough sex, already!","This story had so much potential but failed to keep the primary focus on the suspense aspect of the plot. There were some of the most viscous and cold-blooded villains to capitalize on but instead the attention was mainly on the endless rounds of sexual encounters between Raine and Seth. While I found a way to eventually bond with them, Seth was a little too cave-man for my liking and Raine a confusing enigma.I think the series has potential so I plan to continue but this one was just okay."
1,do not trust reviews and star ratings,"Thankfully I checked this ebook our from the library and did not pay for it. I actually checked out the whole McCloud brothers bundle, but don't think that I will waste my time reading any of the other books in the series. I won't give a summary of the book, as many others already have, but I will say that I was disappointed. I liked the general idea of the storyline, but it was poorly written and had no real character deveopment. I agree with another reviewer who stated that the just did not feel any connection and care about the characters. This book did not flow. The heroine went from one extreme to the other and it just did not make for a good read. I forced myself to read to chapter 19, with the hope it might get better, but it did not. Sorry to say this is one of those times when the star rating was wrong. If you like a alpha male try Simply Love by Catherine Anderson. It is an oldie but very well written and kept my interest."
5,Sizzling!,I enjoy books of this genre. The stories take me to another world--another place in time--and supply me with a great way to unwind after a hard day at the office. Behind Closed Doors is one sizzling read! I loved it!!!
4,Loved it!,"I loved this book. In searching for new authors I had several recommendations to try this author and I chose not to. Finally, I got the book at the library and could not put it down. I am not a huge fan of romantic suspense except for the paranormal kind (Christine Feehan's, Ghostwalkers and Lora Leigh's - Elite Ops), but I truly enjoyed this book. I am looking forward to reading the entire series. I would love some more recommendations."
4,Behind Closed Doors,"Seth Mackey and Raine Cameron both have an agenda. Seth is looking for the person that killed his brother, while Raine wants to know how and why her father was killed. When these two come together passion takes over leads to some very highly charged erotic encounters. This suspenseful read is also well written and fast paced."
2,too much heat can be bad,"Now, I like steamy novels but too much of the good thing can get boring. Behind Closed Doors is a collection of sexual romps between the lead characters with a sketchy ""plot"" thrown in to drag it out to about 400 pages. Seriously, the hero's obsession with sex (esp oral sex) almost seems unseemly, and after a point the description of the hot scenes almost becomes repetetive. I found myself skipping the erotica to get to the finish. It was that bad!"
3,A Very Cold Novel,"Yes, the writing was great and the plot oustanding, but Raine and Jesse lacked warmth, and in fact, exuded none toward anyone, including each other. Which was pretty amazing considering everything going on in the novel. Also, Jesse showed little kindness for his associates, and especially Raine, a woman for whom he claimed to have strong feelings.Sorry, just too unfeeling for me."
1,Too Much Sex,"Shannon McKenna's plots are good - what there is of them! Too many pages of detailed sex - If I wanted to read porn, her books would be OK - But I don't care about reading porn. Most books have 2 or 3 pages of sex and they are easy to skip through. S. McKenna doesn't have anything else to write about. We all know what happens when a couple gets hot and heavy and we don't need a detailed, blow by blow (pun intended) description! I will NEVER read another book of Shannon McKenna!"
1,I expected better than this from this supposed pro!,Give me a break! I have never been so disappointed in a supposed pro in my life! This is the last straw with this writer as far as I'm concerned! This book sucks might! Don't waste your time!
5,SEXY READ!!!!,"This is a book that grabs you and holds on. There is no place for modesty when reading this book. Shannon McKenna portrays both the dark and light sides of women (and we all have both). Not only are the sexual scene intense, but the book actually has a good story to it. I have ordered everything she has written and I know I won't be disappointed in any one book. I don't even have to read a review to know that I'll really enjoy her stories. She's in a few anthologies with Lori Foster, which are really good too. If you want a good sexy romp and good stories, you won't be disappointed with anything Shannon McKenna writes. Good reading!!"
1,HORRIBLE Book!,"The woman in this book seriously lets the guy walk all over her. He does something horrible, disappears, apologizes, repeat. No woman in their right mind would act like her."
5,Sure to go on your KEEPER shelf!,"Behind Closed Doors is sure to become one of the best reads of 2002. Seth is all Alpha male - very sensual and sexual, very in control. The suspense in the book is tight, but never overshadows the romance. The growing relationship will keep you on the edge of your seat. Hot, intense, fast-paced and compelling. I LOVED it!"
3,Just Okay,"This is the first Shannon McKenna book I have read. I got through the book easily, but I was left feeling disappointed. I thought the pace of the development of the relationship, especially given Raine's history, was completely unbelievable. I felt it was forced on us. We are supposed to believe this girl who has had prior experience with one man (a bad one at that) jumps in bed with the hero and they are in love in less than a week. And on top of that, it is hard to believe that she suddenly becomes this sex vixen after a couple of romps in the hay. Not buying it.On a positive note, I did like the story surrounding Victor. In fact, I found him to be the best character of the book. I will continue the McCloud series, but I hope the future stories are better."
4,Catchy with good uses of old Star Trek sound effects.,"When, I first started listening to the song at first i just thought it was going to be another Techno song with the same old Star Trek lines, but i was pleasently surprised to find a move'n Rave tune that used new, and some old Star Trek effects in a new fashion. Overall i think the song was well tracked and would deffinataly one that would be great to dance to at a Rave. JBHighlander"
5,Taming the Tiger- the book that changed my life.,"When a friend recommended this book and said it was about a murderer who finds God, i at first though it would be a book that i would find dull and i would read a bit and think that it wasn't my type of book.How wrong i was. The very first chapter had me gripped , and after reading just a few pages i couldnt put it down until i had finished the whole thing. Not only is this one of the most exciting ,interesting and fantastic books i have ever read, it also opened my eyes to god.Even if you are of a different or no religion i recommend this book fully as it is thrilling. There are many pieces of action in Tony's life, along with lots of sorrow, happyness,fear,anger and love and they make a great read.This is one of the few books i have finished reading as i am not much of a book person.This book really gripped me."
5,Taming The Tiger a fantastic read,This book has totally changed my life when i started reading it i couldnt put it down. Tony's journey to find god was awsome and he has helped me find god too. Me and tony are alike (except kung fu) so when i finished the book i got intouch with him and he gave my great advice and i told him how much i loved his book it really touched me in a powerfull way. I became a christain in October 2005 and i got baptised 21st of May 2006. God is awsome and he found me using Taming Of The Tiger. Thank's Tony :)
2,"Entertaining story, dubious facts","I read this book because my sister was excited about it. First part reads like a good adventure novel but contains some highly dubious claims. Skeptics have been unable to verify Tony Anthony's claims about him being a three-time Kung Fu champion. The sequence about visiting a wild tiger during training was especially hard to believe, as was the lifting of red hot heavy iron object with his bare hands/arms. He should have permanent third degree burn scars after that. These are extraordinary claims but where is the evidence to support them?The second part gets really annoying after a while. Everything that happens to the author is interpreted as divine guidance. He admits to have been involved in a hit and run accident, for which he is sentenced to jail in Britain. Even fatally hitting a poor female bicyclist with his car is interpreted to be divine guidance for him! Odd theological thinking, indeed."
5,Reads like a suspense novel,"A riveting story from 3x Kung-Fu World Champion about his contests, his body-guard career that swirls out of control, ending up in prison: twice. A great story of redemption. Authentically told, warts and all, that points to God and the need for him. Very compelling autobiography."
5,the best book ever,"I really think this is one of the best books evers,Im not mutch of a reader but this book really captured me.I strongly recomend everybody to read it, you won't regreat it i primise..."
2,The beginning of the end for DeGarmo & Key,"After two solid and interesting albums of prog rock, DeGarmo & Key start their transformation into a pop band, putting together a mediocre album of dated early 80's pop. The snarl and blues guitar are gone, as are the Emerson, Lake & Palmer synth workouts. Maybe it would rate 3 stars if this was the best the band could do, but it was a major disappointment for fans like myself when it came out."
4,Great Quality,I got this a few years back for my other computer. Now my mother is using it for hers and its still loud and clear as ever. My only complaint is the volume control and power buttons are on the back the the base box... VERY annoying to have to reach down there. But all in all it still works for us years after purchase and tons of loud music and movies played.
5,Turning me on to a new genre of music,"DJ Harry is ahead of his time with this remix. I have heard him spin many times live and his range of music is extremely diverse. He has the ability to pick out the quality sounds in whatever genre of music he can get his creative hands on. This album is no different, concentrating on the jam band groove. I dont consider myself a SCI fan, but DJ Harry has made me appreciate their sound and his vibe in an impressive mix that has lasting appeal. NIce work Harry!"
5,A Must Have!,"DJ Harry blends the acoustic sounds of jamband music with detailed electronic programming to deliver an incredible album. I enjoy String Cheese Incident's music, but am more of a dance music fan and I highly recommend this album for anyone who wants a continuous dance jam of mountain-top soul.I'm usually against buying electronic producer's albums because I don't like the pauses in between songs: DJ Harry has eliminated this by ""String""-ing the songs together in a delicious earful of a mix; it's brilliant.Buy this album, it defines an entire new genre of dance music and I'm sure we'll see more Organica beats from electronic producers in the future."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I really enjoy my AVR-1905. However, after less than 1.5 years I lost the left channel on the analogue audio. My attempts to contact Denon USA customer service were completely frustrating: long--we're talking about 25-30 minutes--periods on hold, then, once getting someone to pick up--if anyone picked up at all, that person either could not speak discernable English or simply had no technical expertise at all and could not answer the questions.Such truly lamentable customer service will make me think twice about buying another Denon product."
2,Be cautious about going Denon until you do some research,"Just learned that Denon,of which I own a high end cassette deck, has outsourced its parts and accessories to a company in Florida. This may or may not be a good thing,but I do not like being referred by DNN holdings to another place when I just want to buy a remote control for one of their cassette decks. Yes the remote for the deck comes with their receivers, and the implication is that I might want to buy a receiver and get the remote. Merry Christmas Yuletide joke of the week. Sorry if you as I love the build quality and features. It may be well to look into the high end Sonys, Pioneers, and a few others. Aloha, Gerry"
1,Bad Leftovers,"These tracks sound like crap. I had an original copy of this album from the 70's and this sounds nothing like it.A few years ago I tried to find a CD replacement and the only place they were available was from a reprinter in Europe somewhere. I complained on one of the many Outlaws sites and was told that the original masters disappeared over the years and the CDs were being printed by some company in France from some real muddy sounding dupes that were located somewhere.Bottom line, the muddy sound you hear from the samples playing on your computer aren't the fault of your computer's sound system. These tracks actually sound this crappy.To bad I didn't convert my vinyl to digital sooner, before I lost them."
3,3 1/2 stars,"I gave it 3 1/2 stars because the leading man is HUNK!! Haha, actually I sorta enjoyed the movie but it was slow at times. I thought it was sweet but naturally it could be a little cheesy (at the end especially!) but it was still enjoyable to me. Now don't get me wrong I loved the ending, but the rational/cynical part of me was like, barf master! But my remaining romantic side was like: Awwwww......!!! The basic gist of the story is that the heroine leaves to interview this reclusive millionaire but she herself has a secret of her own, as well as he.Oh and did I already say Franois-Eric Gendron is a freaking hunk here!!!! I don't normally like Frenchmen but he looks HOT, and his accent wasn't too flamboyant or anything but uh, he was hot. ~_~"
5,Love Him,Although not one of his better albums. I do love the guys music. Saw him first in France. Love his more modern Freanch songs. came in good shape and on time
2,He's so boring,me and my best friend ashley watched this over a year ago and we were bored to tears. Its not that the film is made bad its just that the subject Mr. B is soooooooo boring. I could not imagine what all these rock stars loved about him and why they wanted to hang with him other than getting their songs on the radio.
4,"Lost soul in Hollywood, so what else is new?","It was interesting that this movie depicted a vicious argument between its own producer and the subject of the film (Rodney Bingenheimerheimenschmitt). Are these guys mired in a pit of self-referentialism and petty comeuppance as they both try to claw their way out of the quicksand of nothingness and not-getting-noticed-ness? Pathetic. Actually, if the movie is true to its subject, I felt sorry for Rodney, but not because he failed to become famous or extraordinarily rich by his grab for fame (his music club did make a dollar here and there on the more talented). I was saddened to see that he was so self-deluded in the more personal aspects of his life, such as his unrequited love for a lowly woman who was a pathetic nobody and had another boyfriend, his detachment from his estranged family, and his longing for acceptance by a fame-obsessed, autograph-seeking mother. A great analysis of a lost soul, and an important message for today's youth."
4,Poor Rodney,"I lived in LA in the 80s. I listened to Rodney on KROQ every week. This film shows what he has been up to since. It seems life has passed him by. Well, me too, somewhat. We can all look back on our salad days. But the music doesn't hold up. It seemed rough and contemporary back then. Now it seems just rough. All attitude and no beauty."
3,They tend to fall off my flatscreens,"I bought these for work so I can see when people are coming from behind in my cube, but one of them frequently falls off and I finally gave up. Also it comes down low so it covers the corner of my screen a bit and sometimes is a bit annoying when trying to adjust a window"
1,Flimsy,Pretty flimsy design as it has no clip to attach to the screen. Kept falling off. Also the mirror does not give a clear view of the area behind you. Waste of my money.
3,Worked great for a while,"I have the black unit that was refurbished. It toasts very fast (or toasted) so saves on electricity I reckon, but it broke after a year. One year does not seem like good value to me no matter how cheap - it still ends up in the landfill. This unit would get five stars if it had a longer life."
3,Cuisinart CPT-140,It toasts very well. Do not like it because:1. It does not shut off automatically when the toast is done.2. I had to add an ON/OFF switch to avoid having to insert and disconnect the power plug during use.
3,Not great,Great if u like your toast perfect on one side and not quite up to snuff on the otherVery unbalanced toasting side to side........
3,BS bagel setting,I brought this unit home because of the settings. I discovered that the bagel setting seems to be BS. On other toasters the bagel setting heats one side only and tells you which one so you can point the cut side to the heat. The pre-browned side is not heated. This unit just adjusts the cook time longer because this bread is thicker. Big deal. You can do the same thing by adjusting the main control. Turning off the heat on one side is worthy of its own button.
2,toasting,"This is my second cuisinart toaster. I find both toast unevenly. They brown bread much darker on the inside of the slot, much lighter on the outside. When the outter side of your bread is acceptably toasted the inner side is near burned. OR you have to toast light and then flip slice and toast light again to get proper toasting. Of course dark one side and just warm the other side of your bread may be OK with some. I will not buy cuisinart again."
1,garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!,just like my review title this is garbage it really sucks i thought that these were real scenes of death but it is 110% all fake crap.when i saw it the first time in the year 2000 i could've sworn that it was real but its not it is the most fake crap i've ever watched.if you want real try traces of death or banned from tv.cause i was really disappointed
1,This Video is SICKINING.,"I have seen this video and think pictures like that should be banned. Nobody wants to be involved in scenes or violence like that. People who think this is cool, are SICK. This is the most disgusting one of the series. Videos like this are one of the points for the violence in our society."
3,YOU SICK LITTLE MONKEY,"Never have cartoons made a better point than in Ren from the Ren and Stimpy showThis film is a rather monotonous look on the morbidity of death. It ain't the prettiest of pictures to watch ( although you kinda know that ). The commentary is like a big joke really. When the presenter tries to look fearsome he looks like a goofball trying to play a psychotic doctor whose "" fascination with the artform "" of death is hilarious. After a half an hour you become numb to the images of death that surround this movie. Weak stomachs are not something you should have watching this movie. And yeah parts of it are fake but even still they do a pretty good job at grossing you outFor those who love this movie - maybe therapy is required!"
2,A joke,"This movie is so fake it's actually a comedy. 95% of this isfake. The fake stuff looks like it should be on SNL. I could make abetter looking video. It is so obvious that it looks like a movie than they skip and show a dummy. If you're looking for a good laugh get this, but if you want good accident and death footage get banned from TV. END"
4,Not For Dog Lovers,I Have never Seen any of the previous faces of death films but when i rented Faces of Death 4 I thought it was fantastic except when they showed the sequence with the cute puppy being slaughtred by that family As a dog lover I hope the Animal rights people see this and raise (...) about it
1,Tricks of the Camera,"Unfortunately, alot of the footage in this movie is staged. Being a film student, it's fairly easy to tell. The concept of the movie is very original and I would suggest it for anyone who thinks I'm full of it. I guess the small parts that are real could possibly be worth the price of the video. To somebody else, that is."
5,Best energy and variety yet,"You can't compare an EFO album to their live show, (yes, every reviewer says this); but Quick is the closest they've come so far: the excitement and energy of a live concert comes through on tracks like ""Let's Get Mesolithic"" and ""Tom Burleigh's Dead"" (backed by a chorus of EFO's friends & relatives) in a way that previous efforts, even ""Portable EFO show,"" haven't quite gotten right. Add in great, quirky, lyrics (""Best of Me"", ""Monotony""), incredible singing (""Great Day""), and a whole collection of musical styles, and you've got a CD that hasn't left my player in the 24 hours since I first put it in.I can't wait to see them again."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"After being a long-time fan, attending many concerts, and owning a good majority of their albums - you realize that EFO has something great going on. This album does not represent the EFO that I know.The downfall of this album is too much reliance on goofball comedic songs. I am glad EFO has fun - and most of these songs come off good at a live show. However, the goofball songs do not translate well on the album. Humor in songwriting has always been dangerous territory. You can mix witty lines with meaningful lyrics and it can come off as a Lyle Lovett or Paul Westerburg. However, if it is done overboard it can easily come off as a Weird Al Yancovic. Unfortunately, this album points to the latter. I have tried to listen to songs like 'Mesolithic' and 'Canexican' but I cannot even get through the song to find any redeeming value.After coming off of a great album like 'Looking Out the Fishbowl' - this album is a HUGE disappointment."
5,Ottoman Centuries,"Superbly written. Excellent overwiew of the Ottoman Empire, in such a short space.It may not reflect some of the newly uncovered facts, but so what.Very highly recommended."
5,Magnificent story of Ottoman rise and fall; power soap opera,"This book should be required reading for anyone planning a visit to Turkey. It is an incredible story of how great leaders carried a border tribe into world super-power status over three centuries and then weak leaders and internal strife allowed its decline into dissolution. It's almost a modern soap opera. Very well written. I carried it on our tour bus and our guide wouldn't let me take it home -- he wanted so much to read it himself, I gave him my copy as a going away present"
2,Who were the Ottomans really?,"As long as Kinross was not exposed to Ottoman files and documents, he cannot conclude how the Ottomans rose and fell. The title too: the rise is discussed, but the fall? What happened?Also, big round applause for the author for leaving the word Armenia out (very talented!).Is it that hard to face the facts so as to become friends again (we used to be brothers!)?No further comment."
5,This One Kept Me Up All Night!,"From the first scene when Zhara Thorne is fleeing the law and ends up in a wheelchair I couldn't put this book down. The law is Detective Cole Wyatt and his warm home is the only place this independent woman, once an ophaned child, has to go to recuperate.Sparks fly, but it takes time before Zhara and Cole are able to trust and both realize that love is possible.Cole Wyatt may be the most wonderful man in any of Ms. Taylor's books yet. Zhara is smart, independent, and strong-willed even when confined to a wheelchair.This one takes off from the start and doesn't stop. I loved it!"
1,Complete piece of non-working JUNK,"The title says it all. Total piece of junk. It reported a pulse, but ""inaccurate"" is an understatement. I was running 120 bpm, and it was reporting 72. JUNK!"
5,Like seeing familiar animals through a kaleidoscope!,"This book is worth it for the ""Bumble Bee"" poem on page 6 alone but the end page art is also incredible. The poets are very eclectic ranging from Margaret Wise Brown of ""Goodnight Moon"" fame to Ted Hughes and D.H. Lawrence! This is a wonderful book for all ages."
1,What a waste of time and money,"I don't recomend this productafter installing you need to activate itthis sounds easy enuff but is a hassle, after a few installsNorton makes you call their tech suport to get activation numbersand when I called, their server was down or somethingso after push this push that wait on hold etc was told would have to call back again,if you don't activate it then will work for just 15 days,its a shame to pay for something that you can't use unless you have lots of time to waste"
4,Very good combination of practical & scientific,"I bought this book on Amazon after it was recommended to me by a local medical doctor who is also trained in Ayurveda and incorporates Maharishi Ayuvedic practices in his clinic. I have been frustrated with the bulk of Aurvedic texts available on-line and in my city, which barely skim the surface of Ayurveda and certainly don't attempt to review the scientific literature on Ayurveda. I found this book to have a reasonably good coverage of the history of Ayurveda, a quite good presentation of the theoretical base of Ayurveda (though they perhaps go a bit over the top trying to link quantum physics to Ayurveda-- I myself am not trained in quantum physics, and I respectfully doubt the authors are...), and a good coverage of practical Ayurveda, with a liberal and much-appreciated sprinkling of well-documented references to the scentific literature on Ayurveda. Recommended for those who'd like to have a solid base on which to build their study of Ayurveda."
1,Not a useful text,"This book is essentially a 163 page advertisement for the products and services marketed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (founder of Transcendental Meditation) and his organization. Though it provides a good introduction to the foundations of ayurveda (which can be found in scores of other books), this book provides almost no information for health professionals who wish to adopt ayurvedic methods into their practice, nor to laypersons who wish to use ayurvedic principles for better self care.Although written by two MDs, Contemporary Ayurveda only serves to reinforce the notion that complementary and alternative approaches to medicine are the domain of hucksters and charlatans. Those with a sincere interest in ayurveda would do better with the books of Vasant Lad or Scott Gerson."
3,good effort for Ayurveda,"i was thinking that there is nothing to read about ayurveda through internet. no one site shows any hing about the oldest method to live healthy and balance therapy to treat the disased without harming as modern medicine does. i would like to suggest maharshi that there must name of aaurveda seperately on each search engine like YAHOO,MSN,NETSCAPE,AOL ANDetc. i am pleased with the effort."
5,Perfect Stand,"I have 3 of these stands. I bought one for my son and I have two at home. It's an easy, snap together stand that a child can put together and looks much more expensive than it is. It's sturdy and holds our 42"" t.v. perfectly. I have bought much more expensive stands that don't even compare with this one. I would recommend this for any flat screen t.v. or stereo system."
4,Awesome,Great Product. My TV fits very nicely. My only complaint is that all your cables can be seen hanging in the back due to the open back on the stand. Awesome Product though!
4,Its Kind Of Small,This was something I wanted to add next to my desk to hold a printer and other computer stuff. I was hoping t would be alot bigger but its ok. I agree with the other comment about if you have a dorm or a small space. If you have a large space this will get lost in the room . overall you get what you pay for
4,Great buy,"For the money, this stand is well made and very easy to put together. I have a 32"" flat screen on top. It would easily handle a larger screen and is very stable, even on carpet. One thing I forgot when I made the choice was that the cords would show. Since I have a surround sound system, sattelite and DVD, there are a lot of wires. Nevertheless, it is a good buy."
3,"SOme surprises, but not enough to bother you.","Was much darker than I expected. But still a very nice solid black. I thought it would be more mocha. It was easy to put together. It took me 5 min to get it out of the packaging and another 5 to put it together. Awesome. Don't expect this to be a piece that last forever. It's not that sturdy. My only issue is that one of the poles/rods would not screw in because the hole for it was made slightly too big. I had to hold it in place while the top part was put on top to keep it steady and in place. Ugh. Overall, I like it."
5,Does its job,This table is everything I want it to be. It holds the TV and my other TV-related gadgets without me having to fear that any will fall and/or break. Was also very easy to put together.
5,"Phenomenal value, easy to assemble","This thing is as easy to put together as everyone says, it feels solid, and it's ridiculously cheap to boot. It fits my 46"" LCD screen, and the veneer finish is flawless on both sides, so if you ever do manage to scratch it up you can just flip over one of the shelves and it's like new."
4,It was so easy to put together,It was easy to put together and worked purfect for our 40' TV. I was surprise when another site had it 20.00 cheaper. Nice looking table
5,Great TV stand with plenty of space,"Pros-Great priceEasy+fast assembling with no tools requiredSomewhat stylish(for affordable TV stand)Should be able to handle most of the LCD/Plasma HDTVs out therePlenty of space for TV, sound system, videogame systems, etc. Veryuseful for vertically-standing systems such as Wii/PS3/360 at theright/left sides.Cons-Doesn't hide the wires that well behind it."
3,Nice item but delivered damaged,"The shelf unit is very nice for the price. Perfect for a college student. It is very easy to assemble. Unfortunately, it arrived damaged. One of the shelves was broken. We are hoping they send a replacement."
5,GREAT ITEM,Bought this for a 32 inch vizio led hdtv and it supports it great and supports other stuff as well. Very easy to set up. no tools needed. Looks great for is price.
5,"Perfect TV Stand for up to a 42"" LCD","This stand is ridiculously cheap and in my opinion looks just as nice as some of the more expensive ($100+) TV stands out there. Incredibly easy to set up with no tools required -- you just simply screw each of the parts into place with your hand, a process that took me about 5 minutes to complete. Sturdy, efficient, and looks like it should costs more than it did. Holds up to a 42"" LCD or a 27"" conventional monitor, or about 58 pounds I believe. If you have a TV within this size range this stand is perfect -- great bang for your buck."
5,Plain and Simple,This was easy to put together and it looks good too. Holds a big 24 in tv no problem. The price is right as well. Overall I really like it.
5,A GREAT buy,"I bought two of these stands for my new 40"" LCD and 42"" Plasma sets. They are sturdy and look great. I've never bought any prefab furniture that was so well made and easy to put together. 10 minutes and you're done! I highly recommend this stand."
5,Great buy,Outstanding value. Very modern looking. Easy to assemble. ( no tools and less than 5 minutes ). Sturdy. Truly a great buy
3,A stepping stone,"I am not a big fan of this book either. And to answer another reviewer's question ""why did he pick this book,"" the answer is he probably didn't. Publishers push their books on either a committee, or a dept. head.This book was so unfavorable that our institution replaced it after only a year with the Stewart Pre-calc (don't know about that text, but his Calculus book is great). There were a lot of problems that went beyond the scope of the material in the text, and a lot of students had difficulty.Later on, I was told by a math instructor that Pre-calc is a ""stepping stone"" to more technical and in-depth study, and that it is supposed to stretch the student in preparation for the calculus. Still, I had a harder time with this book than I believe I should have.If you have to use this book, Schaum's makes a good supplement to go along with it. For the second part, just use their trig book. It does have a nice cover though, doesn't it?"
3,eh,"This book is set up differently than most other textbooks, especially math text books. It combines what should be in three or four separate sections into one on many accounts. The professor that I have teaching this course repeats daily the fact that this book is somewhat confusing as well, which leads me to wonder why he would have chosen it as the text for his course."
3,"A good story, but not well told","Fannie Lou Hamer is fascinating. The writing style of the author can be a bit thick at times, and it's not a whole lot of fun to read (unless you're studying the stuff)."
1,a disgrace,"I knew this would happen--this book uses Mrs. Hamer to suit the author's feminist agenda--and the author is clever---she damns with feint praiseShe will say Mrs Hamer was not a feminist BUT... Mrs Hamer was against abortion because she was devout BUT... we call this rhetorical technique ""limiting sentences e.g. ""even though.....nevertheless"" a common mode of lying.I will tell you my agenda I believe that almost all feminists are war mongers liars and racist hypocrites who piggy backed off the civil rights movement.Toast me or roast me I don't much care--and if you want to murder your children( a phrase Mrs Hamer used) well I can't stop you But do not try and turn Mrs Hamer into one of you.Her speeches have been published (with the same perverse commentary) but if you want to know what this heroic woman was like read those.Mrs. Hamer was mocked by movement people because of her piety--it is a scandal that that still continues--even under the guise of haigography"
1,Westiinghouse light review,"The liht works fine,but their shipping department does not know how to package the light for shipment .It was shipped in a box that is to large, they only put 1 piece of packing in the box and this allowed the light to slide back and forth in the packing box. Since it was shipped to me like this, when it arrived the glass cover for the light was broken in several pieces. I notifed the vendor of this problem and he said he would take care of it and send me another glass cover. He did and when it arrived it was packaged the same way and the glass cover was cracked but not broken. I epoxied the crack and used the cover as I was not going to ask the vendor to send me another glass cover. I will never use this vendor again."
1,Warning!! There's no software included!,"The product description under features ""*Create your own calendar"" and one product review that refers to software included in a similar product led me to the assumption that this kit included software to make a calendar. IT DOESN'T! What you get is a box of paper with perforations (glossy on one side) and a little plastic ""GBC"" type binder doo-dad... Since I do not have any Calendar making software, the kit is worthless to me unless I go out and spend more money. If you have some software already, then great, but do not buy this product thinking it has everything you need to make a calendar out of your family photos."
1,DO NOT BUY THE PEPPER PAD!,This computer is one of the worst items I've ever had (I took it back in the first week of using it)It has a horrible screenAIM doesnt work at allInternet Browser is soooooooooooooo slowDON'T BUY IT!
1,Very dissapointing,"Iordered the Pepper Pad in April, and it arrived in August (it had not been released.) and I was willing to wait because I thought it would be excellent and worthwhile. But when it arrived, i was VERY dissapointed.1. It has a TERRIBLE touchscreen.2. Its performance is very very slow3. Its incredibally big- not just large, but BIG.4. You cannot TAKE pictures or SHOOT videos- only store them. The company needs to make that clearer.5. Its WAY over priced.Trust me- this things stinks. Don't waste your money on this piece of work, no matter what the other reviews say. I personally did not like it. But if you wish to take a chance with it, go right ahead. I was extremly agrivated with this product."
1,"Small Package, Big Disappointment","I bought the Pepper Pad hoping to get out of Windows, into Linux and onto the internet. I could turn on my DVD player remotely, but internet connection kept getting dropped at home and at a cyber cafe. Sent it to Pepper; they supposedly fixed the wi-fi card and upgraded the firmware. The condition seemed worse when they sent it back to me. I called tech support and they never got back to me. I sent it back for a refund and now own a Axim X51v which can pick up a signal 200' away from router."
2,Questionable Ratings,I own a Pepper Pad and question some of the people who rate it with 5 stars - especially those who post the exact same comment on multiple websites that review this device. Makes me wonder if they have a vested interest in the product.
3,THE KID WHO LOVED THE GAME BASEBALL,Baseball fever was a 3.5 star book because it is about a kid who loves baseball. It is full of fun stuff to read about like how he couts down to opening day. I like this book also because I love baseball and Ezra also dose. This is why I like the book.
4,Baseball Fever,This a a great book to read because it is about a boy who is completely opposite of his father. They are always getting into fights. Then they make a bet and it changes everything.
1,"great book, but one ethical issue","How it could be possibly be ethical to charge $52 dollars for a 98 page paperback is just beyond me. Was there a shortage of cardboard and binding tape? Acedemics- sure, but it's ethics, not biotechnology!"
5,RESTORATIVE AND REFRESHING,"Infused with the restorative energy of the sea, Azur Body Lotion deeply hydrates and rejuvenates skin with vital nutrients as it scents with a refreshing ocean-side fragrance.Little wonder that it's one of my all-time favorite body lotions. I love to treat myself or give it as a gift as it's packaged in a lovely sea blue and green box that needs only a tie to make it present-giving ready.Since its founding in 1982 Thymes has won legions of devotees with a naturally derived bath and body collection. With a true love of nature and a passion for art founder Leslie E. Ross Lentz began experimentation in her kitchen. Not only were the products she developed luxuriously conceived but also beautifully packaged. Today the Thymes line is available in over 5,000 specialty stores throughout the world. A testament to the quality of these items.- Gail Cooke"
4,Convenient and Valuable BIble Stury,"The Coffee Cup Bible Study Series by Sandra Glahn is presented in a convenient format. Since the Biblical text is included in each easy-to-carry book, it is a series ready for women on the go. There is ample room for recording your thoughts and conclusions. I like to work on mine in a local coffee shop. Both the scholarship that went into the study and the author's insights are thought provoking and inspirational. I have finished two of the studies so far and look forward to continuing the series. Espresso With Esther prompted me to look further into the commentaries available for this book of the Bible. Whether you tackle the book alone or with a group, I think it is worth your investment of time and money."
5,"A Fresh, Pleasurable Bible Study!","Sandra Glahn's ""Espresso With Esther"" is a delightful study that is truly portable! She has included all scripture referenced in the study, which makes it easy to carry your book with you and fill it out as you have time during the day. Her style of writing makes you feel as it you are sitting in the room with one of your best friends. Bravo for a great, in-depth, make-you-think study!"
4,"Good, little Bible study","If you're new to doing Bible studies, the Coffee Cup Series is a good place to start. Or if you're new to doing them on your own, or looking for something shorter and more compact (this one takes about 5 weeks).Glahn has put together an interesting and thought provoking study on Esther. The daily chapters are fairly short, although there are occasional days when they are longer and take more time (but still nothing more than 30 minutes a day) so it's easy to fit into a schedule. This study includes the Scripture verses being studied directly in the book which is handy to have with you.My only complaint about this study is that some of the questions can be difficult to answer with very little guidance if you don't understand a question or two. Nearly all of them are very straightforward but there were a couple that I found tricky."
5,A Great New Series!,"Esther has been a Bible character heroine of mine since my first Bible book study, at the age of 10, when I was a member of a mission organization at my church. To find that her story, Espresso with Esther, had been included in a new series by Sandra Glahn was very exciting and appealing to me. Glahn's writing style is easy to read and prompts the reader toward reflection on our amazing God and His works. The research and knowledge of the time in which Esther lived, included in the study, is spiritually enlightening. Physically, the book is cleverly designed and sized to make studying/reading convenient anytime, anywhere and is displayed on a soft beige paper and brown font that is easy on the eyes. Having the scripture printed in the content of the study pages is another bonus feature. I will read more of this series!"
3,Nothing to Read Over Coffee,"My wife is doing this study with her women's group and she said the whole group agrees that the divisions of this book contain way too much content to cover in a week. The author is a very knowledgeable person, but the average women doesn't have the time read and dig through and research all that is required in the book each week. While the study is good, perhaps dividing each chapter in half or thirds might be better represented by a coffee cup series."
1,What happened?,"Every Kashi product I have purchased has always been great. I don't know if these were stale or what, but they tasted awful, like stale peanuts and no flavor. In addition, the center was so chewy that my jaw hurt after eating one. I gave it one star because if you really need something when you are out hiking in the middle of nowhere, it was filling. I think the 2 worst things about this were 1) all other Kashi bars I have tried are really yummy, and 2)it LOOKS like it would taste great. I would recommend the chocolate almond bars instead."
5,Great bars,"Love these bars! For 120-130 calories, you think you're eating a candy bar! Way to go Kashi!"
1,Stay far away,These are excellent if you like the texture and flavor of chewy bark dust. I would rather go hungry next time...
