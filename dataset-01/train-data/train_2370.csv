5,Thanks for the memory,I installed the memory in a motherboard with a low power VIA C-5 chip and installed OpenSUSE Linux 10.3 on it. The machine has been running for several weeks without any trouble. Good product.
3,Plates for the universal dock,"This item is a Adapter, i Belive is for the 3rd generation iPods,(10,15,20 GB)."
3,3-1/2 Stars Strictly Lyrics,"Big L is defiantly one of the dopest mcs that ever touched a Mic. The boy could seriously rap. He produces an album that is strict fire with a great flow and style. He basically uses a free style battle throughout the album. The reason I only gave it 3-1/2 stars are because the production is not up to par at all, as well as the fact the content of Ls lyrics after a couple songs gets extremely repetive and monotous.Overall 3-1/2 stars I would recommend cd for people who like lyricsits, Chino Xl, Nas, Ras Kass, Canibus."
5,Where did this kind of rap go?,"Ok folks I am normally a west coast gangsta fan, but after listening to 50 cent's get rich or crap trying soundtrack, I had to come back and look at the reviews for this one. The funny thing is that here in November 2005, TEN YEARS after this album came out, there are still 4 reviews in the same month. That goes to show how classic this one is, and how the east coast has gone downhill in the past few years. I can barely listen to anything from the west coast except Jigga anymore, or a couple of the Wu-tang solo albums (old Genius, Ghostface, etc).. but Big L belongs right up there with the greats, and somehow he never got famous. Too bad.. this is a tight CD.. worth your money."
3,most overrated album ever?,"please, don't hate on me for just giving this 3 stars.. i'm a huge d.i.t.c. fan and i got love for L (rest in peace). but this album isn't really that great. L is a ill lyricist far above your average, but the freestyle flow and lack of concept in many songs makes me kind of bored. also i don't think the beats are what they could be. you can't even compare them to the beats on the true ditc-classics: funky technician, word life, runaway slave, awakening, stunt blunts & hiphop etc.and let's be real about it... this lp isn't even top 10 from 1995.doe ore die, krs-one, dah shinin, livin proof, liquid swords, ob4cl, legal drug money, good fellas, labcabin california, 2000, soul food are all much better albums."
5,DONNA HAYFORD THE DOOR IS THAT WAY,BIG L was the man he had skills that were comparable to well... NOBODY the production on this album smokes and is probably some of the best ive heard the beats have a strong mid 90s feel to them lyricaly L always brings it but I would not recomend this to people who are easily offended now Mrs. donna donna howard who the h-ll do you think you are wouldnt know talent if it bit you on the ---. Some 12 year old retard reviewing clay aiken and brittney spears and then trying to be an authority on HIPHOP ive got news for you HIPHOP is much more than just a bunch of players and thugs talking fast over a messy beat and yes it is a valid art form and if it wasnt for HIPHOP I would not be alive today thats right I would not have survived my college years if it were not for this messy noise. If you dont like Hiphop dont waste your time listening to/reviewing it. think before you speak up sista oh yeah the CD 5mics
4,4 Stars strictly for lyrics,"Big L had loads of potential. He had a great delivery, sick metaphors, and a signature voice. Pretty much everything an MC needs to be successful or at least respected. Unfortunately Lamont Coleman aka Big L was gunned down in his hometown before he really got a chance to show his talent. This was his best effort before he was killed, and although it's not spectacular, it will have to do. One thing can be said, and that is that Big L was definetly nice on the mic. He is what holds this album together and earns all 4 stars from my rating, not the production. As a matter of fact, the production is what holds this album back. On only one track, ""MVP"" would I consider the production good however the rest are put together well enough and with Big L rhyming over them, they deserve a 4 star rating."
5,The Illest MC To Ever Grace The Mic,"Yo,If you don't have this ish, you better get ahold of it immediately. Big L's 2nd album's pretty hot too, but his first is off the scale. And if you want to hear the most incredible verse he ever spit, you have to got to hear a 7 min. freestyle he did with Jay Z back in 1995--you won't be sorry."
4,Wasted Talent,"Big L has incredible talent. He is up there with Ice Cube and Eazy E skillwise. He just has no production. Songs like ""Da Graveyard"" would be a classic. If Big L were signed to Bad Boy or Rockafella, he'd be one of the best rappers ever.MVP is a classic. The best produced song on the album.I reccomend ""Lifestyles ov tha Poor & Dangerous"" to you if you like lyrisists and classic hip hop.I don't reccomend this to you if you are into 50 Cent, Young Jeezy, Ludacris, and those rappers."
5,Whats Hip Hop With Out L,"2pac wack.............If it werent for someone like L, Hip Hop would be real dumb. We would all be hearing 2pac spouting off his wack, simplistic lyrics, and continue to hear hip hop ruined. Pac made his career off the diss record, that i think has ruined hip hop, and anything that big L did is a breath of fresh air into the game. Most underated, unappreciated lyricists EVER!!!Him and Biggie 1 and 2. West Coast rap should bow down with their BS lyrics, and there easily duplicated beats. Drop Pac and pick up an L album if you a true fan of hip hop.."
5,BIG L...................... THE GREATEST MC OFF ALL TIME....,ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT BIG L ... IS THE GREATEST MC OFF ALL TIME..............2PAC IS THE GREATEST RAPPER OF ALL TIME..............AND L IS THHE GREATEST MC OFF ALL TIME...............PERIOD...........BIG L.................. R.I.PHE WAS JUST SOMETHING...............ELSE......................
1,Is this a joke?,"I can't beleive anyone would say that this album is a classic or that Big L was a the greatest MC. The beeats here are terrible and the rhyming is pretty lame. To me this sounds like the typical NYC MC with one style and the whole album sounds like one long freestlye over weak beats. If Big L was an MC from Ohio and still alive, I guarantee that no one would think that this was anything near a classic album. Don't believe the hype on this one."
4,Dora Dora Dora the Explorer....,"What can I say, my 2 year old daughter loves this CD more than anything else we put in the CD Player. over 40 dora songs? She dances around the house reciting the words, and has a huge smile on her face while doing it. Best money I have ever spent."
4,entertaining,very entertaining contains most of the songs from the show my son loves it songs go very fast I guess in order to fit all of them in one c.d. but overall what i wanted good for a birthday party
3,Could have been better,"I bought the CD and I wasn't too happy with it. Neither was my daughter. We still listen to it, but most of the songs are very short and they don't have a lot of variation. We are stuck on song number 37 (Swiper no swiping) and the other songs are unmemorable and less than a minute and a half long. Not worth the money,even for my little Dora fan can't stand it for long."
2,"Music to my daughters ears, but not mine!","I bought this CD together with Diego's Animal Jamboree. After listening to both, i'm so disappointed with the Dora CD, coz the songs are way too short and lyrics are somewhat meaningless.Although i dislike this CD, i can't say the same for my 3YO daughter who seems to like the music. Then again, it's probably because she could relate the songs to segments of the show.I would recommend it to all young Dora fans, but for parents, don't set your expectations too high or you'll be disappointed."
4,My Son Seems To Enjoy This CD,"My son really enjoys listening to CD's via his personal player and headphones. His tastes range from ABBA to the Police, Backyardigans to Madagascar.Knowing that he enjoys Dora the Explorer books and DVD's--and seeing that this CD featured 44 songs--I thought I'd buy it for his birthday.Although there are 44 songs on this CD, the run-time is only 42:03 minutes. Do the math and you can see that some of these songs are just snippets.However, my son has been listening to it at least once every day--all the way through--and seems to enjoy it. He'll even take it upstairs and put it my CD player to listen to.If you're a parent and the songs on Dora the Explorer irritate you--especially because of the repetitive nature of the songs--you may not be thrilled playing this in the car and having to listen to it. It's kid friendly, but not parent-friendly.If your child enjoys music and likes Dora the Explorer, he/she would likely enjoy this musical CD."
4,Not just for Xena fans,"Tammy Jo Eckhart had an interesting idea: use hot sex--mostly of the gay and lesbian variety--to make mythology more accessible to modern readers. She retells the story of Hippolyte and Heracles, Antiope and Theseus, Penthesileia and Achilles, and four others mainly from the Amazon point of view. Eckhart has a bachelor's and master's degree in Greco-Roman history. Each story begins with a quote from an ancient work of literature and ends with an essay on sexual politics in the the Greco-Roman world. (It's actually a little bit dry.) Amazons is an off-beat editon to my large collection of books on mythology and women's studies."
3,Rare gem for rare minds,If you arre completely devoted to the lovecraft mythos of cthulu and such you will be facinated with this book as it provides many names and references for stories you migth have read for the casual reader a few good things can be found a few duds but good materiala rare gem and a good find
3,"Interesting, but way too expensive","FIrst of all, I bought this book for the magickal rituals contained in it. There are only about half a dozen of them, and they require quite a bit of effort on your behalf. One calls for making a model head. Another calls for creating a ring with silver and bronze. Another is making a pendant. If you're not a real hardcore magick practioner, this is going to require a bit more effort than you're used to. On a good note, these are intense rituals, and quite interesting. The problem is that this book usually goes for a steep price. Most of it is various stories or commentaries written by the editor about various old cults and stuff like that. He connects Lovecraft and Crowley to weird theories and history, which is fun to read, but not worth the price. Also, you can find the spells online, so this might be a complete waste of your time and money if you're just looking for those."
4,"If you want Gothic, you got it!","Hawkridge is a perfect example of a gothic mystery. The lonely, dark moors of England, dangerous bogs, a mysterious hero/villian (yes, it does keep you guessing! ) and of course, a fairy legend. There are many old legends that most readers of English fiction will recognize, which makes the story all the more interesting to read. I thought it was great..a quick read I could hardly put down. Try it!"
5,Good!,"Just purchased it about 2 weeks ago, will need more time, but there are noticable differences: Alittle more noticable horsepower when I needed it and my gas mileage went up, meaning less time at the gas station! Worth the purchase!"
5,Definite upgrade!,"A definite seat of the pants feel when installed on all of my previous cars. Corvette L98, 5.0, Silverado, Camaro LT1, Suburban."
3,No Change,"I second the opinion of the person who saw no change.I have a 2011 Nissan Murano SL AWD. I brought this and place it in the car after 500 miles of use on the factory filter. I have not notice any acceleration change, nor have I seen my fuel consumption lower. I drove as I had when I was on the factory filter. But I did noticed one change, the noise level coming from my vents, they have gotten louder. I have 5000 miles on my car now, so after 4500 miles, I still see no diff. The car is pretty steady at 19MPG for the past 2 months, and this car supposedly rated at 18 - 21 MPG for highways, so with this filter, I am still getting the lower end of the gas mileage, so I am not sure if this is working at all. And yes, I only spend about 2 miles on city driving and 40 miles on high way commuting to work, during non rush hour.I did have a K&N; for my previous car, which is a 2006 Honda Accord V6 Sedan. And I can attest that there was improvement which lead to this purchase."
4,Good & Immediate Horsepower,"This product is very good, not great, but good. I say very good because it sounds amazing & defiantly improved the horsepower immediately. But on the flip side I have noticed my gas mileage has gone down a little. The only other issue is it didn't fit perfectly. Actually I had to shove it in and broke a sweat putting it in. But it does fit, increases horsepower, but does not improve gas mileage like stating."
4,KN Air Filter for my G35,"I have noticed a little more power in the mid to high power range. Although I haven't seen an increase in gas mileage. It's to soon to judge the overall reliability and performance, but I am satisfied so far!"
5,"50% Hype, But the Remaining 50% is Still a great filter","First, this filter will NOT give you huge horsepower gains, it might give you minimal MPG gains just by replacing the filter from a dirty, clogged one, but that will come with any filter. I bought this filter because it does save money, money you would be spending buying paper filters over and over again, with this and a 10-15 dollar service kit, this filter will last your vehicles lifetime. There is a trade off though, this filter does not screen out dirt as well as say a ""paper"" or foam type filter, that is why ""off roading"" voids the damage warranty. however i never off road, and for highway and street use, this filter is King in terms of economy and durability (it is made of 4-5 layers of cotton encased with a aluminum wire mesh surrounded by hand poured urethane), they mean it when they say it will last a Million miles. This filter earns my recommendation."
1,Don't use with Nissan Murano,Installed in a 2007 Nissan Murano and suffered immediate degradation in engine performance (-3 mpg) and extremely loud engine noise (roughness when revving and erratic rev count when idling). Both issues stopped when i switched to standard Nissan parts.
4,better than the stock replacement,Definitely better than OEM but will eventually replace the system for a cold air intake. Motor does seem to breath better.
2,Not impressed.,"I have tried this drill twice now but had to send them both back. The chuck was not in alignment and wobbled making the bit walk. I drove down to look at them at the store in hopes that Amazon had a bad batch. Nope! For the money you spend on a Makita it should be much higher quality than the less expensive drills but this is just not the case. I just wish everyone else would catch up to Makita's battery technology. Everything else about this drill seemed perfect (size,weight,power)"
4,Very GOOD Drill,This drill replaced an old one also Makita. Its a little heavy but if its anything like the old one I owned it will last and last with a lot of use.
2,Nothing like Bulgakov's play!,"If you love and respect Bulgakov, the finest Soviet writer of the 20thC, you will hate this Soviet-cum-Hollywood BIGSCREEN War&Peace; extravaganza. Absolutely nothing of the intimate witty language, the legacy of Bulgakov. ReadFlight (Nick Hern Books)instead. What a read! Yes. Then open his other works, starting with the early novellas, likeHeart of a Dog.and thenA Dead Man's Memoir: A Theatrical Novel (Penguin Classics)short masterpieces!"
1,SHAMEFUL!,COREY BLACK DOE NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO RESELL PASTOR MICHAEL HOGGARD'S WORK!!! THESE VIDEOS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE AND FROM HIS MINISTRY! SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!
3,Interesting...BUT,"I purchased this DVD to help me research and investigate the UFO and Bible connection.How would this play out in the near future when the church is raptured out of this world.This documentary would have been alot better if he had used more visual aids.You can only capture the audience attention for so long being in front of the camera.Moving around would have helped also,rather than just standing in front of the camera the whole time.While he did provide some,it was not nearly enough to help his arguement.One thing I found odd out of place is when he started using numbers to justify his Biblical Prophecies.It became annoying,You can not reduce the grace of God to mere numbers and how they add up.Be warned,if you purchase this DVD,have plenty of coffee or soda to keep you attentive to the subject he is covering.Don't get me wrong,it's good material for reference,but he needed more visual aids to help it move along."
4,Useful,"You could use anything to do the same job, but this is the easiest way. For a mysterious reason car seats are never leveled and I used to put a folded towel underneath. But then I bought this item and I've been happy with it. Even If in the middle seat the leveler doesn't fit between the two seat belts."
4,Cheap looking foam but effective,I was expecting higher quality foam but it is as pictured and firm. Its light as a feather and efficient
5,Great Bilingual Book,"I just read this one to my four-year-old, and both she and I loved it. My daughter easily understood the meaning of the Spanish words from context. Plus, there's a glossary in the back of the book with pronunciation. Fun illustrations and story. We also like the beach version."
5,Te Amo,"This is a great book for introducing Spanish to younger kids. Even if your knowledge of Spanish is limited to a couple of classes you took as a gen ed requirement, you can read this to your kids easily."
4,Comprehensive and brief,"I recently moved to Australia and have to pass local college exam. This book is very helpful. All topics are generally well presented. Brief and to the point.One really annoying problem - incompleteness of the index. It is sometimes necessary to perform search of three-four keywords in order to find the topic you need. Some topics are also a little dated, for instance, there is no mention of ropivacaine in the chapter on obstetric epidural. But that is the fate of most reference books: new topics pop up very often."
4,Caliper,Really great product but the website & customer service are not as great as the product:(Software does n t work with Mac and no body can help you ........
4,under control rabbet plane,"I have used these planes from the older 1800's style to present day types. The length of base and width of shoulder make these the most affordable quality planes on the market with tons of control. I own and operate a {1700's and up} restoration and remodeling business and rely on tools like this every day.If you should buy one, invest in a sharpening set up(vertias).this tool is only as good as the condition of the blade.Hilliker Home +Design"
4,Stanley Rabbet Plane,"Does not work as smoothly as the pre WWII models, but is satisfactory for occasional work. The older ones are hard to find with guide and depth gauge, so this is a good value in that respect."
2,Buy a better plane,The plane was so poorly packaged it arrived with a broken body. The second one arrived a few weeks later and I must say the quality leaves a lot to be desired. I spent hours of labor to flatten the sole and as suspected also had to hone the blade. This is probably the lowest quality plane I own of the 12 in my shop. Spend more money and buy a better plane.
4,good workhorse,"There's nothing flashy about this plane but it gets the job done. This is a classic design that Stanley has had around for the last 100 years or so.I use mine on nearly every project. The iron is decent, but just your basic stock iron. It takes an edge well but isn't the best at retaining it. Out of the box the scoring spur was way too long. Mine extended nearly 3/16"" below the sole. A few seconds at the grinder fixed that though.with the spur ground to an acceptable length, this plane cuts flawless cross-grain rabbets. Providing your stock is nice and straight grained, this plane makes great with the grain cuts as well.For the money, it'd be hard to beat this plane for a daily user."
4,Good value,"There are higher-end rabbet planes out there, but this one performs well. Two blade positions provide adequate versatility for most (all?) situations. Guide is useful. The plane handle could be a little more comfortable, but it's quite functional. Overall, I find this plane to be a good value."
5,QUOTE,"""or this new collection of Bratz that's coming out this year Bratz kidz which is a look at Bratz when they were ages 8-9. They are dressed in clothes that any 8 or 9 year old would wear.""When is that coming out? I would LOVE to add that to my collection!"
3,Yasmin`s good,"I like this Yasmin.She is better than the others.Dana is also in this collection.I like her and Yasmin.Jade is very wierd.Cloe is like a funny clown,and Sasha is the goast.This collection is not the best in this year.I don`t think people liked Bratz in 2006 that much than they liked the Bratz in 2005.Bratz in 2005 was much better.Here are all the Bratz dolls I have:1.Bratz Rock Angelz-Jade2.Bratz Birthday Bash-Phoebe3.Bratz Dynamite-Cloe4.Bratz Play Sportz-Gymnastics Yasmin(2006)5.Bratz Midnight Dance-Meygan(I`ve got her yesterday,but I can`t find her here anymore.I wanted to write a review about her)Bratz dolls I want:1.Bratz Princess Fianna2.Bratz Campfire-Dana(maybe)3.Bratz Rock Angelz Concert Stage with-Roxxi4.Bratz Twiins-Oriana & Valentinaok!That`s it!!!SARA SIBLINI!!!BIG BRATZ FAN!!!"
3,She's nice with a few minor problems.,She's pretty but she only deserves 3 stars due to her AWFUL makeup and hair and how POORLY dressed she is. NOT slutty but I HATE the clothes. This Yasmins nice but I don't suggest buying her.
2,...,"nice review adie, fairytaleprincess! i couldn't agree more. believe me people do wear skirts that short. in school even! not me though but these are dolls they're just fun to play with. they will in no way influence my life. and also who cares if they're unrealistic. need i remind you of... BARBIE! and these my scene OMG my sister has one. if you take their shoes off. it looks painful to stand. MUST be painful if they're feet are a size 1 shoe size. at least bratz can stand on their own. i have a ton on my shelf, 18 actually and they can ALL stand well. that may be why mgae made their feet big anyway"
1,yeeeah...,"yep this space IS for my scene's... and the bratz section is for... yeah you guessed it BRATZ. so if you don't mind would you please tell your fellow obsessed my scene fans to stay away. ""Bratz suck blah blah"" we don't need to hear it, thanks"
1,this is leweez10 and don't say that aboput my friend,"So what, she writes mean things to My Scene dolls, it's not like My Scene fans don't write bad things about Bratz dolls. YOU are the stupid one. And you are not her mamma, she can do what she wants, and so can I. My Scene dolls suck and they always will. Deal with it. They are ugly and slutty like it or not. Bratz rule and My Scene drule."
1,"Go Fairytaleprincess (this is leweez10, your amazon friend)","Yeah, finally, fairytaleprincess is making a very good point there. You let your kids do things more dangerous then they should, but you don't let them play with Bratz dolls? You people are twisted in your mind. and also, My Scene dolls aren't that wholesome dressing nicly dolls either. I mean, have you people ever looked at the Bling Bling dolls? They couldn't get more sluttier if they tried. My Scene dolls are ugly too. And you people think Bratz dolls are ugly, I guess you never looked at a My Scene dolls either. Because they could break every mirror they look at. And their style is always stuff that was out. I mean look at there clothes. There style sucks. They try too hard to make their clothes look cool, that their styles always suck. They suck and Bratz rule."
3,Changed my mind...,"OK - first posted a review because I thought the CD was manufactured incorrectly and only had all songs on one track. Turns out, my DVD player was jacked... Ooops! Unfortunately, I can't bump that 3 to a 4...Anyway, this CD is a great listen. Throw it on with headphones and trip out, or just put it on for some background party music. It is great for all situations and Van Christie (Die Warzau, Pigface) is one of the best programmers to come out of the American electro/industrial scene.Note that this CD is NOT industrial music at all (like Skinny Puppy or FLA) but is more dubby - good for fans of Death In Vegas. Also notable is the excellent use of a sample of one of Charles Manson's many incoherent rants - very creepy."
5,Solid explanation for growth investing,"I don't know why some readers give it a low grade. Investment is a combination of art, science and legwork. You cannot beat the market by scientific calculation only. Even Warren Buffett has to use 85% value investing and 15% growth investing. Don't over-emphasis on quantitative technique, qualitative technique on growth rate estimation is a must!"
5,"The Lynch Classic--Unbeatable, except perhaps Warren Buffett's Annual Reports","Lynch makes lots of good points. One of them is as a small investor you can buy into thinly traded stocks on the way up, such as APCC in the early days.Big funds simply can't get enough stock to make it ""worthwhile,"" an interesting point, usually overlooked by the pros in their writing."
5,"Great Book, must read for anyone getting into investing",Read this book after it was recommended at an investment website. Great read and I think it should be picked up by anyone who is starting to dip into the world of investing in stocks.
4,"Good book, informative and educational","Peter Lynch writes well and this book has some classic wisdom that lets you into his mind. One drawback is that Mr. Lynch may sometimes forget just how smart he is and tends to over simplify some aspects of investing analysis that come to him naturally. For example, asking a clerk at a retail store what sells well is a technique Mr. Lynch will use on occasion to evaluate a stock. However, it's key to note that he also has a great deal of resources in the form of advanced technology and research tools, not to mention personal genius.This book is highly recommended and can be a great tool for a business owner or investor but I'd caution most non-professionals on reading this and thinking they can become the next Peter Lynch with little more than a computer and a brokerage account. Good book, thanks Mr. Lynch."
3,Repeat of One Up On Wall Street,"I think that Peter Lynch ia a great investor and a good writer. But I found ""Beating the Street"" to be, for the most part, a repeat of Peter Lynch's previous book ""One Up On Wall Street"". If you are a die hard Peter Lynch fan (as I am), then you will find both books enjoyable. But most people should bypass ""Beating the Street"" if they have already read ""One Up On Wall Street""."
4,No formula but...,"If you want a checklist of items that you should review before buying a stock, forget it. The formulas aren't stated clearly in there. But if you read carefully and understand the message behind the words, you will learn how Lynch picks a stock. So, if you are a lazy reader and seldom take notes of what you read, this is not the book for you."
3,An entertaining start,"This provides an entertaining yet simplistic view of stock picking. What Lynch writes can be applied, but is very shallow and is only for the very long term investor who doesn't enjoy dabbling in technical or fundamental analysis. In short, it's worth a read."
2,Eh...,"Not all that useful, really. Message is ""buy mutual funds!"". In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice. Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks. Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation. Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice... (""Mr. Gates, your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares"")."
4,Decent book on investing,"I have not read Mr.Lynch's other more famous book, which is 'One Up on Wall Street'. But after reading Beating the Street', I feel that I get the gist of Mr. Lynch's philosophy, and he gives his hands on experience on investing in stocks. His insight into the Japanese market was particularly revealing. He has written the book at the beginning of Japan's lost decade, and it is commendable that he has not joined the crowd on Japanese stock market frenzy. That said, this book does not give the reader a systematic way to invest and his method could be subjective. For that Benjamin Graham's ""The Intelligent Investor"" would be a perfect starting guide. Danger of Lynch's method could be that one thinks that one understands the business, when one really does not. In the investing world, it is very important to know what you know and what you don't know and know what is possible and what is impossible. It is the key to not lose money."
4,A good strategy guide... with old examples...,"I recommend this book to those: who are relatively new to the financial / investment arena and are looking for some insight into a sound investment *plan*... and can tolerate some very outdated examples.----------I enjoy Mr. Lynch's insight into what makes a good investment plan and have gathered some very useful information from this book. I will admit to having to maintain a constant ""what CAN I get from this example?"" approach to a majority of the book as it is a bit out-dated. Then again, *wisdom* is never out-dated... just the parables.Go in with an open mind, a hungry drive, and pluck yourself up some useful tips from a very knowledgeable individual.----------Found it for $1 @ GoodWill."
5,Successful value investor share his experience,"Peter Lynch shares in his experience how to beat Wall Street in this book. Warren Buffett invite him to Omaha, NE. If Peter Lynch commented Ben Graham'sThe Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing. A Book of Practical Counsel (Revised Edition), he would have done a much better job than Jason Zweig"
2,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT LIKE 'ONE UP ON WALL STREET'","The first half of this book picks up where his previous (and much better work) One Up on Wall Street left off. About half way through though Lynch veers off and rambles on and on about SNLS and other obscure stocks thereby abandoning his ""buy what you know"" theory (unless, of course you are an investment banker and probably wouldn't need this book). A big letdown after loving his first book. Difficult to get through after first half. Better to re-read OUOWS again."
3,"Good Themes, Nothing Revolutionary","This is a good book to read for the casual to serious investor. Some of Lynch's prominent themes like ""Buy what you know"" and investigating the companies that you buy are great reinforcement. However, if you expect to read this book and come away with the ability to pick stocks a will that will make money, you won't. Lynch spends a lot of time telling the reader how he went about picking stocks for his Magellan Fund, but he has the ability to talk to CEO's and visit companies on site headquarters, something the average investor certainly does not have. To be honest, the second half of the book gets boring and you don't take much away from it but some basic common sense themes. I would reccomend this book to enhance your overall knowledge, but don't expect anything you haven't ever heard before."
3,"Not as good as ""one up on wall street""","I have to say that Lynch's ealier book is a better reading, as it detail more of his matters of picking stocks.In this book, nothing new is introduced beside trying to get the average investor to invest more wisely in mutual funds. I really think that Lynch should actually discuss more on the technical aspect of his stock picking matters.My advice to other readers - Do not waste your money if you already had a copy of ""one up on wall street""."
4,Good starter,This book explains ivesting in layman terms. Which is good for starters. It also tells you how to evaluate stocks without having to read a dictonary. Great sound advice from the best fund manager in history.
1,Lynch loves himself very much,"I can't believe this book has been reviewed 5 stars. It is horribly outdated (many companies it mentions are out of business), the writing is insubstancial and borders on join-my-Lynch-fan-club promotion. I didn't learn anything from it, other than the simple (and obvious) fact that you need to research companies before you buy into them. But when Lynch goes and tells up to call up a company CEO to ask them how things are going (as he recalls numerous times throughout the book), that's when it's worthless.Save your time and money and go with someone else."
1,This review is for all of you new investors...,"This book is considered one of the best books for teaching the small investor how to pick stocks. Forget it! The market is in a mania (1994-1998?) the likes of which the capitalist world has never known. Instead, check out JK Galbraith's ""The Great Crash"", ""A Short History of Financial Euphoria, Allen's ""Only Yesterday..."", and James Grant's ""The Problem with Prosperity..."" to understand why ""small investors"" should not delude themselves into thinking that they can ""beat the market"". Stocks are for ""risk capital"", not savings!"
3,"More than the basics are covered, but not GPS","This book is dated, but many aspects of navigation are still the same and you can learn a lot from reading this (275 pages). I especially liked how he covered pre-trip planning. Mooers goes beyond the basics, but due to the age of the book, GPS isn't covered. He includes route finding problems, Decision making, weather, navigation by several methods without compass and much more. A minor weakness is that he doesn't have some good illustrations of a modern base plate compass (orienteering compass)being used to both take a bearing in the field and to calculate a bearing on a map. You can, however, find these on line easily."
2,Take with a grain of salt,"Overall not a bad book as there is a shortage of books to tell you how to actually get into the business of antiques. It desperately needs updating; it has no mention of ebay or other Internet sources. I didn't like the authors advocation of rude behaviour at garage sales and other venues in pursuit of a ""deal"" or his obvious mistrust of auctioneers. Perhaps it's a regional thing. Don't make it your only source and read with an open mind. Take the good, leave the bad, and get some good books on sales, marketing, and small business to go along with your technical antiques books."
2,Save your money,"While some of the information was helpful in a very general sense, much of it was outdated and unrealistic. Overall, not a particularly useful book."
2,Shot on the cheap,"Compared to other performances of the Chi-Lites on DVD Sweet Soul Music is a bad release. Chi-Lites on ""70s Soul Jam"" and TJ Lubinsky Productions are much better. Here you'd think the producers were even embarassed to fully bring the audience into the camera of a dimly lit arena. Save your money and buy the others."
1,A very basic book,"This book is very basic indeed and is certainly not for the natural perfumer at all. The recipes are aimed purely at the aromatherapist or home industry who may want a natural blend of oils rather than a serious perfume. The recipes consist only of 2 to four essential oils and there is no concept of the top note, middle note and base note as required in perfumery."
4,paraguard,Pretty much does what it says. I use the dip instructions when I get new fish. Doesn't stain aquarium ornaments!
2,Not much here,"A folksy yarn, mostly black and white pics, a tedious read.A little information about the partition bullet wedgedbetween all the heart warming stories of human triumph,a bit boring."
4,john nosler going ballistic,"i really enjoyed reading, about the life of john nosler. his hunting experences could have gone on for several hundred more pages. and the story of the nosler bullet companys growth into todays fantastic supplier of reloading and hunting products, was well done."
4,"Clever story, beautifully illustrated","My twin boys (22 months) continue to laugh hysterically at this book and somehow I haven't gotten tired of it yet. Wonderful illustrations with a very nice close. A bit of cartoonish violence(bears on bicycles running into mailmen) might put it in the not-for-everybody category, though."
4,Very good,"Would've rated 5 stars if it had more of a vinegar taste. Overall, not bad at all, good snack"
4,Good pair of snips,Great pair of snips. I like the bostich ones a little better but these aren't too far behind. I use them to cut metal studs and they are easy to cut with. Had to adjust and lube when I received them.
4,Great 80s toon share it with kids,Cant go wrong with the carebears . they need more real cartoons now not the cheap flash animation and cgi crap
5,An evenhanded examination of Sri Lankan Buddhism,"Colors Of The Robe: Religion, Identity, And Difference by Ananda Abeysekara (Assistant Professor of Religious Studies, Center for Interdisciplinary Studies, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) is an evenhanded examination of Sri Lankan Buddhism and it's intersection between culture, religion, ethnicity, politics, and much more. Individual chapters deftly address religion and identity, as well as the scourge of violence that seems intertwined with religious differences, socio-political issues. Colors Of The Robe is a very highly recommended contribution to Buddhist Studies reference collections and supplemental reading lists."
1,"Bogus information, a high-impact security risk","Quick perusal finds several lisp functions whose assesment is utterly bogus. Lest you believe this is limited to less well known languages, consider this:This book lists the C function ""gets"" as a *low-impact* security risk, whereas in the real world it is one of the more common points-of-attack for buffer-overflows.Don't buy unless you intend to sue the author."
1,Appallingly bad,"Based on snippets posted online, the authors and publishers of this book should be deeply ashamed of themselves. The ""Risks"" sections of various Common Lisp functions are complete gibberish--for instance warning about wildcard characters in filenames when discussing the IMPORT function which has nothing to do with filenames. But that's just one example of many. Basically nothing of what I've seen that they say about the ""Risks"" associated with Common Lisp makes any sense at all."
1,Does not work with Vista,"This PC850 bluetooth adapter has no support for Vista (no 32-bit or 64-bit support). It simply does not work, at all, period. I cannot find any mention of any future plans to support Vista. Attempting to install the drivers on Vista resulted in many, many, many prompts to allow the uncertified drivers to install. After intallation, inserting the device into a USB port causes Vista to start a new hardware driver installation wizard. Eventually, it exhausts all possibilities and says that it cannot find a solution. Checking Motorola's website, they have updated 32-bit drivers, but I cannot find any updated 64-bit drivers. However, their website says explicitely in the FAQ that this device is not compatible with Vista. Save yourself the money and trouble and buy something else."
4,Motorola Bluetooth works well,"The product works perfectly with windows XP, and is reasonable priced. I would have given it 5 stars, except that the installation and initialization instructions were lacking, but its all pretty standard and I could muddle through."
1,Does not work with Windows Vista Operating System,"This product, created in 2005, and using WIDCOMM Bluetooth Software, is basically obsolete (hence the cheap price) with current computers. It supposedly works with Windows XP and earlier versions (I wouldn't know; I have Vista), but it most definitely does not work with Vista. I spent 6 hours downloading drivers, reinstalling software, searching help blogs, etc., before I finally found a web site that told me quite clearly what the seller should have made abundantly clear: this does not run on Vista."
2,Nice drill - bad chuck,"I was in the market for a new cordless drill since my 12V Craftsman gave up the ghost. I built a lot of furniture and did a lot of DIY projects around the house. As a result, I was looking for a drill that had very good battery life, good ergonomics, and on-tool storage for screwdriver bits.I bought this 14.4V drill and am pleased with the battery life, charger function, and charge time (1hr or less).I am VERY dissatisfied with the chuck on this drill! The chuck does not hold drill bits well and allows them to slip. Now my drill bits look like I tried to cut screw threads on their shanks.The second issue with the chuck is that the bits (screwdriver or drill) never self-center in the chuck jaws when going from a larger diameter to smaller diameter bit. The bit gets caught in between the chuck's jaws.I would not recommend this drill, at this price, to anyone."
2,makita 12 v drill,"Ordered a drill received a blower. Called Amazon was told to call Makita. Mikita said it was Amazon's fault, send blower back (my cost) MaMakita 6217DWDE 12-volt NiMH 3/8-inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kitkita will send me a drill (my cost). Called Amazon and they said they will give me credit on my next purchase to cover the cost of shipping.Wm. Ballantyne"
2,Great tool but the batteries ruin it.,"This is an excellent cordless drill, and the flashlight is great, too. Unfortunately, the batteries, even with light use, lose their ability to hold a charge within 2 to 3 years. Replacement cost for the 2 batteries? $145. So you're out virtually the whole cost of the kit in a short time. It's a rip-off."
4,14.4 Volt Cordless Drill,"Makita's 14.4 Volt Cordless Drill delivers long term power with excellent torque in a variable speed tool. It is considerably heavier than the old 9.6 Volt cordless I have but it is well balanced and fits the hand well. My only complaint, which is minor, is that Makita could do a bit better in the case that holds the drill, two batteries and charger. Plastic is okay, but at least stabilize the items inside. All-in-all a quality Makita tool."
4,"Makita !/2"" NMH Cordless drill","This is a solid unit in typical Makita form. The NMH batteries are superior to Ni Cad batteries and a main selling feature to me. The only issue I have is the stiffness of the 2 speed selector., if your hands are not really dry it is a real struggle to change speeds. I would recommend this drill to anyone and it has a solid keyless chuck as well. Overall a solid no nonsense unit that has an electronic brake that is super."
2,"Good methods, lousy writing style","I didn't care for Hempflings' writing style. He had some good things to say but it was all over the place. He rambles about his mystical ideas and is a bit prideful. This said, I appreciate his general message that horses react to gentle methods and don't need an alpha human to control them.Maybe I'm biased becasue I was so turned off when he interpreted the Cain and Abel story as being about one person with a duel personality?!? What's this got do with horse methods... I don't recall now...something about shepherds. He overstepped the bounds when he tries to change the Bible.The 26 character groups is a bit much don't ya think? Human learning styles experts usually get down to 4 basic types (some 8 or 16 when examined in detail but 26, come on!) HOw many people know 26 horses personally?I much prefer Mark Rashid's conversational writing style and easy-to-understand, commonsense methods."
1,This Is Far From Swing!,"The title track is not representive! Why? It's very good! This album is boring. It is mix of vocal groups sounds, pop of the eighties, shakin' stevens-wanna-be-rock'n'roll, a cover of Radiohead Creep (very boring cover),... If you like the title track you should buy a Swing compilation ""Swing On The Wild Side"", coz this album is not even worth listening."
1,Keep on looking,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a good place to learn CORBA. While I picked some things up because I didn't know anything at all, when I did learn the correct way of implementing CORBA, I realized how this book over-complicated many things. The biggest problem is the proscribed method of compiling the projects using Visual C++. Sheesh. It is a lot simpler that the process they use. The actual IDL examples are OK, but overall, there a better books out there that can be had."
1,Where is MY review.....?,"I wrote a review for this book about one month ago and I still do not see it here. I wonder if it is a waste of time to write a review? I would like an explanation as to why my review was not put in with the rest. I took a great deal of time and thought to create that review. I also followed your guidelines, what is up?Thank You Rob Fisher Programmer/Analyst"
5,Handiest keychain addon ever,"I have been looking for a replacement for one I lost to the flipping TSA 2 years ago. Unlike alot of keychain knives, this opens one handed. This makes it easy to use in claustrophobic storage areas to open boxes and packages while holding them in one hand. I use it at work, at home, and while gardening."
5,DELIGHTFULLY CUTE!,I'm a fan of both Morris Chestnut and Gabriel Union. So the pair together is a double good time for me. This movie was fun to watch and it gave that warm holiday 'fuzzy' feeling at the end.
4,Love In The Time Of Christmas,"This movie was such a wonderful love story at Christmastime. A divorced mom who just wants to get on with life and love, daughter who wants Santa to make her mom's wishes come true, and a teenage son who just wants his parents to get back together. Well, Santa delivers, though the sleigh ride to love was not easy!!!"
3,Good Movie,"The writing could have been better, but still it was a cute movie. Charlie Murphy was hysterical. Terrence Howard was funny and Morris Chestnut was yummy as always, so what was not to enjoy."
5,Great movie!!!,I really loved this movie. It is funny and family orientated. I suggest that everyone get their family together and see this movie. I loved Gabriel Union and Morris Chestnut's (so handsome by the way)performance. I cannot wait for this movie to come out on November 11!! It is about time too!
2,Not A Good Movie,I love Gabrielle Union and Morris Chestnut BUT The Perfect Holiday was not perfect. The story line was CUTE but not written for a major motion picture. This type of movie would have been great for Lifetime or a movie that goes straight to DVD format. I gave the movie 2 stars because the cast was well picked but the story line was lackluster.
4,Great Holiday Movie,I really enjoyed this movie. I remember watching this on Christmas with my family. It' a family movie that brings the spirit of xmas with a romantic comedy twist. It's not the best christmas movie but it's good.
2,Cheesey Movie for Teen&adult but Cute for kids,"The only reason i got this movie was because the store did not have ""this christmas"" movie with chris brown in it. i was, at the time in the Christmas spirit. so i went on ahead a brought this movie. the oldest boy in the movie was funny, and so far as to Morris and Gabille, it is a far cry from the type of movies that used to do, in the late 90`s and early 2000`s. and so far as to Tarence and Oueen La, i don`t even know what was the point of them being in the movie. over all this movie is good for children. I am 27 and my sister is 11, i would buy this type of movie for her."
4,Not Exactly What I was Expecting,"I love Morris Chestnut and Gabrielle Union, but this movie was not what I expected. It wasn't bad, it was just mediocre. I have watched it a couple of times, but I think it was just to keep the Christmas spirit flowing and it was good to watch something festive during the holiday season. Please see it for yourself. You may think differently."
4,A decent Holiday movie,"This movie is a pretty decent movie. It may not be a very good Christmas movie compared with those a few years ago. But, this movie is still to be at least acceptable. For the story, it is a very good Christmas love story, very typical that I can say. For the acting, they are good especially Queen Latifah. For the direction, they are all okay on that. For the visuals, very decent indeed. Overall, good movie."
2,Purchased wrong movie,I ordered this movie by mistake so I haven't watched this movie. I may give it to someone or watch it when I'm bored.
4,Perfect Holiday Review,This is a great holiday movie for kids and kids at heart!! It is romantic and funny and still has a few surprising tid bits for entertainment such as the comedic timing of Murphy... I love Queen and her nemesis Terrance make a great ying/yang combo!!
3,Just relax and read,"This is the perfect book to read while traveling, on the beach or maybe in a waiting-room. Is not a page-turner-thriller nor has an exciting love story but you'll have a good time reading it."
5,Fabulous Yo-Yo-Ma,Mix this CD with one reasonably good glass of wine and a decent hi-fi and you have the makings of a relaxing and wonderful evening! If you purchase only one Yo-Yo-Ma CD--make it this one! Enjoy!!
5,"worth it, and more","I played cello for about 15+ years before I had to stop and now I am restarting. These Sonatas are what gave me the drive to dedicate my life to the cello and yes, they certainly did inspire me to return to the instrument. I believe that the charm of the Sonatas lies in the fact that they can be played well by an amateur as myself, or by a master as Yo Yo Ma. I obtained this recording for free as Columbia House was still throwing out CD collections to the masses for a penny. Needless to say, I have enjoyed them.NOTE: A master can make these soumd immortal, and universal an amateur spends their life aspiring for a moment. A fantastic recording"
5,Just Beautiful,"This CD brings two of my greatest musical loves together: Bach and the cello. The fact that the cello is unaccompanied, and played exquisitely by Yo Yo Ma, makes listening such pure joy. It satisfies on all levels."
5,Simply Perfect,"Ma plays the Suites with passion and grace. The cello is recorded wonderfully. Often in solo performances, hearing the artist breathe can be annoying, but that is minimal in this recording.I would also highly recommend Bach: Lute Suites performed by John Williams.Lute Suites 1 - Essential Classics"
4,Exceptional,"The single most astonishing performance by Mr. Ma. Somehow Mr. Ma outdones himself with this performance. This highly talented artist dares to interpret his composer with elegance and exquisite technique. Feel his fingers detecting the notes as he plays. Lisaten to his heart beat as he stops... In this CD by Mr. Ma, the musical notes invite you to participate with the composer to dance amongst the Lilies, and pleasantly be taken in the air by wind and water. This CD is amongst my very favorites to do art work, oil painting or calligraphy. perfect for expectant mothers and new borns.. Highly recommended."
5,Love listening to this at work,"I really enjoy listening to this CD at work, it offers relaxing background music and since there is only one instrument, the Cello, there isn't a lot of novel sounds that jump in to distract me. At the same time, it offers beautiful music in the background."
4,Unfortunately It's Not Mel Tormé on His Best,"Fortunately, Tormé's output for Columbia Records was not big. Here you'll find a compilation CD where Mel proves total command of his singing though he is a prisoner of mellow and full-of-violin arrangements. Beautiful as someone could say. But not for his Jazz fans. Also it lacks all that creative vocalizing which is the main trace of his jazz performances."
4,The Kansas City Athletics,"Good for fans of nostalgic baseball, including teams that were not so good! An interesting read about a largely overlooked franchise, as compared to the Oakland A's & Kansas City Royals.I like the fact that statistics are enclosed; so it's good for geeks like me!! LOL!"
3,Good output but hardly worth it...,"These are fun little lights that are only good if you need to ad some quick fill or an eyelight for a closeup, but otherwise they're pretty worthless.And at their current price, they're just not worth it either.I was surprised at the amount of output they have, though. However, they're just not broad enough to suit my needs."
4,Best deadblow value,"Great value. Made in China. Cheap, hard, bright orange plastic parts. The hammer itself is filled with sand. It does the job."
2,Tiny Monster Truck Sticker book,"The most important things to know about this book are #1: It's tiny and thin, more like a booklet, and could fit inside a small envelope. #2: There are a total of 12 stickers inside the book, and nothing else. #3: The stickers are hand drawn/painted. #4: The book itself only retails for $1.50. I paid $3.49 in shipping and handling. If you're dying to own this book, pick it up at your local bookstore and save yourself some $$$!"
3,Well worth the price ($1.50),"Not sure what's going on with the wacky pricing. I found this item at a local independent bookstore on its rack of zillions of other Dover sticker books. It was $1.50. Are the stickers the awesomest stickers ever? No. The illustrations are hand-drawn (which is fine) and the colors are very muted and washed out (not so fine). They are certainly fine for little bitty rewards for my 4 year old boy, but they aren't great. The quality of the stickers is good, I will say that."
4,I Recommend this book to my color students,I have been a color consultant for over 20 years and I train new color consultants. My system and methods are a compilation of what I have learned from studying the color systems of many talented individuals. Nicholson and Crum were the first to create a system that placed more emphasis on color intensity and color combinations...than color temperature. I believe both aspects are critical and still recommend this book to my students after warning them they should not judge the book by the hideous pictures of garishly made up models in the book.
2,Review Summary,"Having read the last 4 reviews I see that the book is rated two ways... Great (5 stars) by users who don't do HP-UX Admin everyday...are just getting into it and want all the essentials explained in one place.Bad (2 stars), by those who have moved on, so to speak, and know most of the material already.Maybe the author needs to figure out which audience he wants to write for."
3,Having second thoughts,"Now that I've installed this, I'm wondering what will happen if I ever need to remove it. One disappointment: There's no place for a toothbrush."
5,Nice way to keep tjhe shower organized,This is a quality soap dispenser and the basket keeps the shower organized. Everything you need in the shower is right at your fingertips now. The install proceedure was very nice and easy to do.
3,Pumps keep failing,I have constantly had to replace the pump in my triple dispensers. I have 4 of tem in my home and as soon as I get one replaced another fails. The company has been good about replacing parts but they are located in Canada and it never repairs quite the same as the initial.
2,Chrome rusted after about 18 months,This products is a great design and we liked it until the chrome shelf rusted very badly after about 18 months. The pump bottles worked great and it stayed in place and never fell. It's too bad that they can't make the chome part better quality.
3,Rusted after 18 months....,Mike has rusted quite badly after 18 months... But I just bought another one and it says that it is Stainless Steel... We'll see... !!
3,works great at first - then let me down,"product works great. need to take everything off it including bottles, hang, and let dry overnight then add bottles etc back on. works good. shelf is large enough to hold face soap, electric razor and more and razor hanger works great tooUpdate... we have had this for a while now and it is starting to rust and one of the pumps completely broke. While it worked it was great, but now we have to replace it. Thought it would last longer than it did"
3,could be much bigger and adhesive that came with it doesn't stick well to wall.,The item is ok. It looks nice but I feel that the dispensers are too small. The adhesive does not stick to the wall at all. My husband had to use stronger glue.
2,PUMPS FAIL QUICKLY,I really liked these at first until they started failing one by one. The pumps just stop working and there is nothing you can do to fix them so they are useless. Very disappointing since they failed right after the warranty period.
2,Rusty Mess,"This pump/shelf system was great at first but now less than i year later the shelf has almost rusted through. I thought this would be a somewhat permanent fixture in the shower and definitely did not expect to have to replace it yearly. We have a large, tile shower and the thing never even gets very wet. Disappointing for the amount of money spent. On the flip side, the pumps are OK. I have shoulder length hair, not too thick, and I have to pump 4 times for enough shampoo and 6 times for conditioner. Not what I expected but I have not had any problems with the pump."
5,sassy2,I purchased this item a couple of years ago and it is perfect for what I wanted. It is still like new.Do not hesitate to buy it.
4,Basket Replacement,"The original basket rusted, however, the two dispensers work great. We took out the rusted basket and replaced it with a small 3M shower caddy. It fits between the two dispensers, and we no longer have to worry about rust."
1,not worth the price !,I was fine with the size of the doll. The book is a waste of time. The print is so small that it is impossible to read. Do not feel that this doll is worth the price being charged. Would not purchase again.
2,Not what I thought,"This item to totaly for show. You can not read the book, but the doll is still very cute."
2,"Tiny, Tiny, Tiny!!!","I got this and the Felicity Doll for my 5 and 6 year old girls for this Christmas. They wanted the real things but I didn't think they were ready for a doll at that price point. So, when I found these I was excited... Then SHOCKED, when they arrived!! Maybe it is my fault and I should have dug deeper in the item discriptions to see if they listed the measurements. I just went off of the cute picture and some of the other reviews. I'm telling you these dolls are ridiculously small! I am sure once out of the box they are cute and my girls will probably be excited but I don't feel they are worth the price. I should have just bought the real thing and at least felt good about the product for dollar value."
2,Very Misleading,"I knew the dolls were going to be small, but I think it is very misleading to not stipulate that the book is a MINI book. I actually thought 19.99 was a TERRIFIC price for the mini doll AND the hardcover book. I received my order and thought that my order was incomplete because I had no idea that the Meet Samantha book would actually be INSIDE the doll box. The dolls are cute and my daughters will love them...but I certainly wasn't expecting such a small book. The ones for 11.97 would be worthwhile. I wish I had read all the customer reviews ahead of time. I did read the reviews for some of the AG mini dolls, but unfortunately none of the ones I happened to read mentioned the MINI book."
2,Disappointed,"While I love the American Girls, this doll was so small, it doesn't compare to the regular American Girls dolls that American Girls are known for. The book on the making of the movie was not very informative. It's better off being a dvd or being part of the dvd. I don't know why they made a book on the making of the movie nowadays when this is usually in the dvd itself. As for the doll, get the larger version instead."
2,save up for a bigger version...,"My daughter is so in love with the American Girl series and when I researched the cost of the dolls I had a major case of sticker shock! I was excited that I found what I thought would be a good compromise. Boy was I disappointed when the doll barely fit in the palm of my hand. I wish I had spent the money on a few of their books instead. Maybe someday we will spring for the ""real"" thing."
3,Not as nice as I thought,"I expected the doll to be small, but thought it would have a hard doll body, not soft. Just not what I thought for the money. The print on the book was too small for my old eyes to read!"
5,Amazing doll,I love this doll it is my first mini doll and she is amazing. Everyone says her bangs are out of control but they are really not if you take care of them. Her hair is a little tangled when she arrives due to the shipping and being in a box soo long but if u mist and brush her hair it's fine. I don't have a problem with anything and the book is small
4,School and Society-Historical and contemporary Perspectives,"Great book with an abundance of historical, political and educational changes throughout our American history, but difficult to read only because of the tiny print. Also, the chapters are long."
5,History of American Education,"Highly recommend! From this book you will learn incredible information you have never thought about before. It will describe economical, political, and social changes in the society and how it influenced the development of education and school systems in the American society starting from 1700-s to the present day! Buy it ... No regrets."
4,School And Society Book Review,"The author takes the reader through the early foundations of public education to the present day. The reader is indulge into the ideology of some the most influential leaders and philosophers of education. Much of the early chapters deal with educational leaders such as Thomas Mann, Thomas Jefferson, and John Dewey and explores some key events that shaped their ideology of education. The text also explores some of the earlier sociological ills that infested public education, which are still visible today. The later chapters dealt with these problems and explore ways that educators can deal with them .The authors takes a look at initiatives that are in place to correct these dilemmas that still corrupt are schools today. At the end of each chapter the authors provide addition sources of reading material that either supports or provides a counter-argument to that chapters theme."
4,A good read for anyone involved in education,"School and Society: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives is a text worthy of mention for all members of the education system. The book provides insight into the evolution of schools and education in America. The text offers good information into the positions of some important historical figures, like Thomas Jefferson, Booker T. Washington, John Dewey, Emma Willard, James Bryant Conant and Horace Mann. Educators can learn how to reflect more critically on their position in the classroom and the social significance of their performance. The text is good for anyone studying the ideologies and different reform movements in the educational history of America. The content was informative and adequately detailed."
1,Unfortunate buy,Withdrew enrollment from a college after receiving this and other similar books assigned to me for classes. Sigh. returned the book
4,Great ideas for Bible teachers,This book by Dr. Elmer Towns of Liberty University is an excellent resource for Bible teachers. I wish I had discovered it before I started teaching the Bible seriously. I will refer to it often now.
4,Very nice,"I had the MG-35 for over 3 month now, I only had SD TV the picture of the DIVX files looks great and the sound is amazing ""I hooked it up with Creative 2.1 system"" I add a 400 GB PATA 300 GB segate Hard drive works great by the way you can portions the hard drive as well.The only bad thing no built in web page you have to install the software to see the hard drive plus it is too slow for 100T ""I don't think it is a 100T"" so basically if are going to transfer pictures or small video clips you can do it over the network but big movie files 700 MB you might spend good 15 min doing that so you might want to use the USB2 unless if you can wait."
3,Connectivity,"This is a nice functional box in general. When I purchased this I wanted the convenience of being able to push files to the HDD via LAN connection, as I don't want to keep connecting and reconnecting the box to my computer located in different part of the house. My experience is the speed of upload is very slow compare to USB2 conection. I should have bought the new MG-350 as this accepts connection of USB devices to it, giving additional convenience. But at the time I didn't want to pay extra for the wireless feature as I found wireless transfers are also slow even at 108Mbs.Hope to see a Gigabit version as that should serve HD streaming well."
3,almost no plans or photos,There are a lot of ideas but they are mostly very simple sort of Middle-school crafts and there are no color photos. About 90% of the projects have no photo or plan at all.
4,Bought as present,"I bought this book as a present for my Mum for Christmas, she was extremely impressed! Not for the early novice crafter! It has good, interesting and technical pagan crafting projects."
4,The Girl Really IS Hot....,"I'd be lying if I said I bought this movie just because I'm a big Clark Gable fan as Lana Turner really is as fantastic as any actress Gable had worked with. The story is compelling and at times feels forced, but Gable carries himself perfectly as an at times despicable character, but as always the heart of gold shines through. Powerful speech to end the movie tells me all I need to know about how Americans in the 40's felt about the war. Something someone my age couldn't ever really know."
3,"She's feeling pretty, but her clothes aren't","I really like the doll, she is pretty. Her clothes her bleh...I don't like her clothes at all."
2,Uh?,"I'm NOT that crazy about the feelin pretty.She looks like a recycled night nite jade.I can't stand it when mga does that,no offense.The clothes are hideous,once again no offense.And there eyes scares me.But I'm still a bratz fan.*GG 14 (Misunderstood)"
4,Oster Makes It Easy!!,"Being a neophyte design student I was totally surprised by thecogent explanations by Ms. Oster for using Adobe Photoshop fortextile design. Easy to follow techniques for gratifying results! The author seems to be equal parts instructor and artist. Highly recommended.Forrest L. BurgenerLong Valley, New Jersey"
1,This book is awful,I am sure this book would be very funny if you were a tiltboy or friend of the tiltboys. The tiltboys sound like a fun and smart bunch of people to hang around with. But I thought the book was a huge waste of time and money. The material in this book may be fit for a scrapbook or a home video but as a published work? No.
1,Really bad,"It is a really bad book. Very confusing to follow, badly organized. The stories should be re-written so it would be easier for someone that is not part of the group to understand what the heck they are talking about. Maybe it is entertaining for the people involved, but for normal folks like me, it was a waste of time."
4,beautronics review...,"For being so completely unknown at this point, ISAN is one of the better finds I've made lately. Along the lines of Plone, Boards of Canada and the first Air CD (Premieres Symptomes), ISAN is electronic in a raw way. It's quite minimalistic in a good way. Think of Brian Eno with a drum machine. But even the drums are minimal! It's nice. Like I told my wife when she asked what I liked about it, ""it's good music that you don't have to think about too much."" Listen to it working or studying, not when you're running around cleaning your house. When ISAN starts to release stuff on Warp (to which they've recently been signed) you'll understand that ISAN is a ""band"" to pay attention to."
5,Most recent not necessarily the best.,"I own 5 titles by this group and find ""Beautronics"" one of my top two favorites. Vintage does not equal greater enjoyment in this case, however I do like all the releases. I think if you own one title you are likely to enjoy another."
2,Not getting what you think you are,"The cards themselves are fine. All 52 cards and nice finish to them.However, I thought I was getting the cards that are in the picture. The ones in the picture are not jumbo indexed, they have a stripped pattern on the back with no logos. The cards I got did have a stripped pattern but had a logo on the upper and lower ends of the back. They were jumbo indexed which I hate!If you just need cards to play then fine but if you are a magician who is looking for real be cards without logos then these are not for you :/"
2,Bee Premium Playing Cards,"I am disatisfied with this product! Who would purchase a deck of playing cards if that deck contained only one Joker? I always was of the opinion that a complete deck contained two Jokers. Had I known these decks would not be complete, I would have passed on purchasing them."
4,I'm surprised there's not a button to polish the canopy.,If you love flight sims and love a good challenge even more this will be the game to ruin your marriage. You have complete control and the action is endless. Ihave been a fan fo Falcon 4.0 for well over a year now and I learn something new every time I play. If you want a quick mindless blow um' out of tha' sky game then keep looking because this game will only frustrate you. If you enjoy the technical aspect of flight and can keep your cool as you drop in on a target aiming your Mavrick rockets while your cockpit is lit up like a christmas tree and alarms are going off in your ears as SAMs try to make their way into your F-16 then make the purchase. It's not flawless but it's a ton of fun.
4,"Falcon 4.0,.... A true sim","If you are looking for a ""just get in, start it up, and shoot`em up ""game"", this is definately NOT for you! If you are looking for a true sim that is as close to getting a feel for what TRULY goes into flying a top shelf jet fighter, this is it! The key is FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. There is no ""quick start"" feature in this baby! But rather 700+ pages of technical information from ""ramp up"" (it takes 20 minutes just to start the thing!)to weapons usage, to landing procedures. My suggestion is, just tackle a little at a time as suggested in the instructions. At first it is a bit discouraging, but little by little it all came together and the next thing I knew, I was in Koria tracking Migs, and destroying targets from miles away. It`s really cool to launch missles and watch the targets disappear from my MFD! Now, couple it with a Saitek X52 control system, and all I can say is ""the joy is in the journey"""
4,Best Military Flight Sim On The Market,"If you are into realism in flight sims this is it. You will not find anything in this genre that has captured what it is truly like to fly into a war zone with a ground war going on below you, hostile aircraft to challenge you and SAM launching on you to deny you entry to the target area. All this with the most realism in the cockpit as well. Most every switch and system in the aircraft perform as they do in the real F16. If it is realism that intrigues and challenges you this is it. Experience what is like to be a Viper Driver."
3,OK,Was just as advertised. The order came in a timely fashion within the stated time line. I appreciate your promptness. Thanks!
3,"Great game, but still has a few bugs","The game is excellent, absolutely the best F-16 simulator out there. But it still lags a bit in terms of it's Windows compatibility: I can't switch to other applications while this is running and occasionally it loads a blank screen instead of a mission. But it has never hung in the middle of a mission and it doesn't mess with the rest of the computer. If it had come with a printed manual I'd give it 4 stars, but since the manual is electronic and since I can't switch between the manual and game in flight, I have to give it only three."
4,Incredibly Accurate Game,"Falcon 4.0 Allied Force is a super nerd game. It comes with a Basic Operations Manuel. [109 pages] that l bring to school and read it when I get bored. It also comes with a 700 page Manuel that you download to your computer that Teaches everything that a real pilot learns.[Trust Me] This simulator is the real thing. You can fight incredible air to air battles in real time with the Ammo you decide to load onto your F-16. You can control your HUD, HSD and every battle, War, and most importantly, the fate of your country.You must by this game with a SAITEK X52 Flight throttle and controller."
5,Greatest flight sim ever,"Title says it all. I hear that Lead Pursuit's next flight sim will be even better. I can't wait for it. If you want to learn all you can about flying the F-16 without having the opportunity to sit in one, then this is the flight sim for you."
5,"If you like simulations, you MUST buy this game....","I'm not going to reiterate what everyone below me has already written, but if you are a fan of simulations, and particulary VERY realistic flight simulations, this is the product for you.The great part is, that even if you are new to flight sims, you can put it on the ""easy"" setting, and just go around flying and blowing things up. If you are more a fan of realistic simulations, up the realism, and you will not find a more realistic aircraft simulation on the market. Quite simply, if you want to know what it's like to fly an F-16, this will show you.I just wish there was a way to get a printed version of the 716 PAGE MANUAL!!! Yes, 716 pages folks, that is how realistic this simulation CAN be if you wish it to be so. Looks like Kinkos is going to be getting some new customers!"
2,Not ready for On-Line Multi-Player Play,"This is an outstanding flight sim. However, game does not work for on-line multi-player games. Difficulties in on-line connections was an ongoing problem with the original version, and if anything this version is worse than it was with the original. Even with instructions provided to setup a multi-player game, players can not connect. This is definatly a show stopper, since multi-player games are the most enjoyable."
2,"Good Sim, poor graphics/VC","I bought this game based on reviews from other simmers. The simulation/flight control physics seem to be spot on. I have no problem trying to learn 75 different ways to lock at target. The problem I have with the game is the graphics are poor compared to Lock On and the only way to manipulate gages in the cockpit is with the 2D cockpit. I have Track IR and with all other sims (Lock On, Wings Over Vietnam, IL2, FS) you are able to see working gages in VC. So the lack of graphics, combined with the virtually unusable virtual cockpit make this game not worth the time to learn it. I think you should expect more from the ""ultimate combat flight sim""."
5,Great sim,Been playing F4 since it came out in one form or another. This version is a great step up from the original version and it's keeping me well occupied. An investment which has been well worth it.
2,Falcon 4 Allied Force,It dosent appear to have any game servers.You must create your own.If you dont know the persons Ip you wish to join in a game with your out of luck.Several of my adult online gamming friends purchased this as well and they are all disapointed.Graphics are sub par and I have a 7800 GTX/OC vid card along with 2 gigs of DDR2 dual channel pc4200 ram.In all fairness I would have to say though that the flying aspect of the sim is very good but could still use some work.As far as the vender it took almost two weeks to get my product.My friends all went to local retail store and picked theirs up same day with little or no difference in price.
1,High learning curve,Maybe it would help if I played this game for more than two hours. But usually if after two hours I'm still crashing or getting my ass kicked I quit. Really high learning curve. I wouldn't recommened it unless you can already fly an F16.
3,this product was ok,this product was a gift and from my understanding he likes it but he dose not play it often but when he dose he loves it
5,Impressive,"I love simulators and this game is fantastic with more realism than I anticipated however I believe that there are more people like myself who although love simulators is real busy in real life (between family, job, sports, workouts n studies). What would have made this more enjoyable if a life size keyboard layout was provided with the game as was done in Jane's F-22. I'm still looking for the key to select a target."
4,CULT Following.....,"Well, after purchasing Falcon 4.0 WAY back years ago for my Mac, I HAD to get this. It's stable, and runs great. Graphica are becoming dates now, but they have terrain updates out there...Hi-tiles is good.BUY IT if you want THE F-16 Flight sim......it's a BEAR to fly and do all of the stuff you need to do, but it's realistic and no one said flying the real one is easy without training.THe manual is 600 Pages...so start reading now.....;)"
5,Brilliant!,"This is one of the best biographies I have read. Not only does it cover Rimbaud's turbulent years as one of the most infamous and brilliant poets in French literature, it also does a good job covering his years in Africa after he had renounced his ""previous life"". It is still quite difficult to discern what really motivated Rimbaud to lead the life he lead, but it is certainly a great pleasure to read about it. Similar to Genet, Rimbaud lead a dangerous and brave life, and now it is possible to see perhaps how personal his mysterious and beautiful poetry really was."
4,Rimbaud by Robb,"A very fine literary biography. A deep penetration into a mind in disarray. If anyone can make sense of Rimbaud's poetry, it is Robb. Robb makes numerous projections about what exactly the subject was thinking at various points in the narration, but they are logical and even if not precisely the truth, it would not matter, as they tie the story together very nicely.I would recommend this book to anybody interested in the bizarre."
4,Easy to put together,This crate is easy to put together. We have a tall Boxer and this crate is a great size for him.
5,Midwest Crate,This crate was the perfect size for my little puppy. Very easy to assemble. Took less than 5 minutes. I also am happy I purchased this brand. The quality and sturdiness assure me my puppy will always be safe inside.
4,Great Crate!,I have a chihuahua and iwanted tomake sure he had enough room to move around and stretch out and this was a great purchase. Its way bigger than the kennel i had for him originally and he went in it with no problems. The assembly was easy except for the divider panel i haven't gotten that to go in correctly but i dont want him going potty in the crate anyway. He is house trained already so i have never had that problem with that. I was Overall a great buy. The package was delivered in the box like if you purchased it from the store and since i paid $12 for shipping i assumed that extra protection would have been taken for the box but i guess not. I received it yesterday in the mail.
4,iCrate,The whole transaction went very smoothly. It was delivered one day a head of due date which was nice. We needed it fast. The crate was true to size and very sturdy. We are very happy with the crate and service we received. Rudy
3,Good crate for the money,The only negative thing I have to say about this item is that you have to press really hard to the point of bending the top of the crate to get it together.
5,Great price,It's an awesome price for a good kennel I bought the same one a smaller size for a more expensive price at petco and when I got another puppy I bought this one and its awesome quality!
4,Good crate with adjustable size,"This crate is a good option, good quality, and good price. I like the fact that you could re-size the crate to fit your dog as it grows from a puppy. I would recommend the crate with the 2 doors though, since you can fit another pet from the other side if you're camping or traveling. That is the best option."
5,Love It!,So glad we got this for traveling. No more worries about her when we have to leave her for a little while in someone elses home. The dog even loves it and her bed fit in it perfectly!
5,Sturdy Crate with Great Price,"I think Amazon has the best price for crates. This is very reasonably priced compared to the major pet supply stores, and it is durable and well made. It was very easy to set up, and I imagine it would be easy to collapse if needed. The divider that comes in the package is great too because it allows our puppy to grow into the crate. We put his soft bed on top of the plastic tray and he loves it in there. He goes to his crate by himself when he wants to take a nap, and he would also play quietly with his toy in his crate."
4,door latch doesn't line up,"Great little kennel for my 36 lb mix breed, but the door 'bolts' that slide over to lock the door don't line up well. We have to apply downward pressure to make the bolts drop a 1/4 inch so they will slide into the 'locking' system. Easy to set up though, great price. Still works"
5,Excellent,"It was easy to put together, great size for our lab- he'll be in there sometimes for 10-12 hours at a time with just a quick lunch break bathroom break once a week or so and we wanted him to have plenty of room. It has enough room for him to move around and stretch out. It's also very sturdy!"
5,Great Product!,"We received this crate for our Lab mix over a year ago and we absolutely love it, the divider that came with it made it very easy to adjust it as our little puppy grew and eventually got to use the entire cage. The price was very reasonable and it is very well made and sturdy. The slide out tray is a nice feature but we rarely need to use it as our huge cushion-style bed we bought for use with this crate takes care of covering the entire floor of the crate. Our dog more importantly loves it too, we only close the door at night when we are sleeping and during the day while we are home the door is left open and our dog uses it like a doghouse going in and out as she pleases. She feels safe and secure which was most important to me since this is my first crate trained dog and I was worried if she'd even like it, she'll often go in to take a nap during the day, so I would say that means she likes it."
5,Great price on the crate.,Had the smaller crate before. Bought this one as our puppy grew. It works great and much cheaper than going to the pet store.
5,Pet crate,Cant say teh dog likes it but we do! Dont need to worry about little surprises on the floor and he can see out and downt feel caged in.
5,Perfect,Perfect fit for my budget this can easily cost anywhere from $150-$200 at your neighborhood pet shop. So I was glad when I found this not only was the price nice but I received it in two days. My pit was especially appreciative with the extra room don't second guess this product go for it!
4,Good cage,"This is a good cage, however our pit can still push on the door hard enough to unlatch it if she gets really excited. Our boxer either hasn't figured it out yet or is incapable of pushing the door out. Over all decent construction, it isn't heavy duty or anything, but it does appear good enough to kennel the dogs up at night."
5,Mini Apartment for your Dog!,I have a 5month old Chocolate lab and she loves her new home so much! Very easy to put together and best part is the divider for your growing pups!! Can't beat the price compared to the stores!!
1,Would never purchase again. Not safe for dogs.,"One look at this crate told me my dog would get out in two seconds. The front and rear sides hook in but can easily be pushed out of the hooks. Even worse, it seems extremely likely that my dog's head would get stuck after he pushed out, a major safety threat. I would never risk even trying this crate on my dog. Company also places a large sticker on the front door that does not come off, is it toxic? Who knows..."
4,24x18x19 Pet Crate,This crate works well and is reasonably priced. I'm happy with my purchase and I believe that my pet is too.
5,Great Crate,I love this little crate.. got a very small puppy and I could make it smaller... it was reasonable in the cost and is a great value.
5,Great and easy to assemble,Great item it feels strong and i love the partition option. It was a breeze to assemble no tools required.
1,The company shipped a previously returned product,"I should have known there would be issues with this crate when my dog showed an uncanny interest in a plastic wrapped box. Sure enough, when I removed the plastic, the box had been previously opened. And returned. Why? Because the product was defective! The sides did not connect, and therefore could not be securely latched.It's a shame that the company knowingly shipped a defective product and tried to deceive me into believing it was new. I paid for a NEW, defect-free crate. That is what I should have received.I give this company one star because I have to give them something. But, I did receive the crate on time. If you are not familiar with this company, I would recommend carefully researching them before purchasing. Or better yet, give your money to a more reputable company."
5,Fine crate and convenient,This crate worked perfectly for my 9.5 lb. Bichon. He had enough room to feel comfortable.Item was exactly as advertised and delivered promptly.
2,Inferior qualify to similarly priced items,"I already owned a crate this size from a different manufacturer and paid around $20. When I received the two new crates I ordered, I noticed the gauge of the metal was of an inferior quality to the one I already owned. Also, one of the doors would not open and close properly due to the whole front face of the crate being lopsided. Very disappointing to spend a few dollars more and get so much less."
3,Not the best quality but ok for light or temporary duty.,We bought this to use on a vacation as we needed a second collapsible kennel for our new puppy. Our intention was to get another one like the Petmate version of this design that we currently own.This kennel is smaller and not as well made as the Petmate.The wire is thinner gauge and doesn't really seem robust enough for the size of the kennel.Also the bottom tray doesn't stay in place very well. Our dog was able to get it completely out while locked in the kennel.This is an OK product for limited our occasional use but if you are buying it for everyday use I would suggest buying a similar designed kennel that is made to a higher standard of quality.
5,Works great for my Westie,"I had bought a big crate for our new adopted pup of 9 months to grow into but soon realized it was to big and heavy to take to the car and the motorhome, so I bought this smaller one that is sized to the dog and it is just right for 1 person to fold up and carry out. The dog loves her crates too and never a problem to get her into them or stay in them. We keep the big one in the bed room for nights and this small one in the room with the computers so almost always somebody there and she often goes into this small one and just hides out all on her own. Just buy it and you can't beat the service from Amazon. Bill"
4,Good quality crate,"This crate uses quality materials and has a nice sturdy feel to the door. My only complaint is that since its a ""folding"" crate it doesn't seem quite as sturdy overall as the ones that lock in with rods. Also I wouldn't want to fold and unfold this on a regular basis."
5,Excellent Crates Affordable Price,"We love the iCrate and own two of them. I originally bought this large size for a lab mix we were caring for. Once we found her, her forever home I was going to sell the crate. However, our chihuahua/poodle puppy has claimed this huge kennel for herself. She wants nothing to do with the kennel that is made for her size. You can't go wrong with these crates."
3,Easy to use crate,"I bought this for my Chihuahua/Terrier mix, and she fits perfectly into the smallest size, with enough room to stand up. I put it together in 30 seconds, and it is very easy to use. However, the smaller crates come with only one latch, and my dog has now figured out how to open the gate easily, as the sliding bar only needs to be pushed out and to the left. (I have a video of this on Youtube, search for ""johnnyma45"" and watch ""Izzy breaks out"". We use a little suitcase padlock to keep the door closed. Overall happy, just wished the latch wasn't so easy to open by the dog."
5,Great crate.,This product serves it purpose and was much cheaper then those locally. Received it quickly and easy to put together.
5,great crate,"i was a little skeptical when i found this crate, but when i got it, it was great. It folds down easly for travel(which we do alot) and is the perfect size for my 6lb chihuahua. I would definatly recommend it, especially for how cheap it is!"
5,Amazing Crate,"I love love love this product. I purchased two for my new puppies and they have no problem stretching out and getting comfortable in it. I added a soft flat pillow and put their favorite blanket on top, and they are already trained to go in by themselves. It is extremely solid, and folds down easily for storage should need be. I like that there is a divider as well that allows me to make the crate smaller because they really are tiny puppies. Overall a great product for this price!"
5,Crate,Well made crate. Came well packaged but the product had a few sharp corners that I easily removed with a file. This product is a great deal at a fraction of the price of the major pet stores. The cage that I purchased is large enough for the dog to sleep on one side of the cage.
5,midwest dog cage,We have chihuahuas and a dachshund. This cage was the perfect size for one or two. Easy to collapse and transport.
4,"Great price, good quality.","I ordered this crate after going to PetCo looking for one; PetCo wanted $85 for a crate 1/2 this size, seriously?Crate is great quality, good features, and the best price on the market from what I could tell.The only downside that I can find, which is the reason for the docked star, is that you can't disable the wheels, so it's always kind of ""rolly,"" if that makes any sense.Amazon had amazing shipping, as always."
5,For our new pup!,We recently welcomed a 12 month old schnauzer (the standard) to our family. First we thought this crate might be too big for him even after he's full grown. But it comes with a part to help adjusting the crate size and right now this crate is working great (he loves his crate!).
4,Great for my puppy,Great crate. It was easy to set up. It's a great size for my shih-poo. I bought the 24 inch one.Only complaint is the latch. It's not aligned perfectly and it's takes a small effort to close. Not a huge deal though. Any other similar crate I would have paid twice as much for so extremely happy with quality and product for the price.
5,i like and so does lexi,as soon as i set it up she went right in after one night of crate training and (crying all nite to get out) she finnaly got adjusted she is a fast learner
5,Was the perfect size,I purchased this product for a new puppy. The shipping was quick and the product was very well made and very easy set up.
5,Perfect size for my Teacup Chihuahua,"Was shipped fast and was a Wonderful Price. Room enough for her bed, food dish, water dispenser and newspaper near the front only for when we are gone."
4,Great Item!,Great fit for my Yorkie. She has been going potty on the floor recently and we needed a kennel to keep her in when we leave the house. The pet stores sold these for $60! Came on here and found this one for over half of that price. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs an affordable place for their dog - puppy or not!
4,Solid and sturdy,"I bought this crate as a traveling crate for a french bulldog, and it has served well in that regard."
5,love it,"i ordered this crate for my bouvier puppy who is doubling in size before my eyes. it's nice that it came with the puppy section divider so she can grow into her the cage (which is GIANT). anyways, other than struggling to find a place to put a kennel that could house my entire family, the crate is perfect!"
3,"A little cheap, but looking at the price you should know that already.","I bought this for my 32lb lab mix. She has been able to bend the wire bars at the bottom of the cage and has undone the bottom latch this way. Luckily the top latch has stayed latched. The cage isn't exactly square due to the way the hinges work, so it looks like you didn't get it assembled properly. Other than those problems it has been a decent crate. My dog is very small for this large of a crate and if she has no problem bending it I would hate to see what a big strong dog could do to it."
5,Awesome Crate!!,"I really like this style of crate and so does my dog. Very easy to assemble and take down for traveling or moving. There is plenty of space for my dog, a 110lb. lab, to move around and stay comfortable in while I'm out of the house. Would recommend this to all of my friends."
3,Too small for my maltipoo!,"Good contruction, easy to assemble, but it is too small for my maltipoo. I recommend you buy the next size up."
3,WARNING: Crate Injured My Dog!!,"I have a large icrate with a divider panel. I do love this crate, however the hooks and edges are very sharp. Today I took the divider panel out so I could collapse the crate to give to friend who is watching my puppy while I'm out of town. I leaned the panel against the bedroom door and my puppy came up to investigate. As she backed up, a hook went COMPLETELY THROUGH HER EYELID. After a couple seconds of her screaming in pain I managed to get her calm enough to careful slide the hook back out and rush her to the vet. Fortunately the hook did not injure her eye but she has a bloody gash in her eyelid and it's very swollen. She's going to have to be on antibiotics for the next week. Vet visit cost $120, half of which was for the emergency status of the visit and the other half for the antibiotics. The hooks need to be rounded off or filed down."
2,Not True to size measurement,"We order the small 24-by-18-by--19 inch. I was so excited it said 19 inched tall; I had the perfect space for it. UNFORTANETLY it is NOT 19 inches tall it is 19 1/2 inches tall. IT DOES NOT FIT!!! Not sure what I am going to do about it, to mad right now to think.UGH get the measurements right!!!!!!!!!!"
3,It is ok...,"Solid, easy to assemble, not very bad for apartment dogs.My dog seems to be not very happy about being caged, though.The divider really does not work for the single door crate. Don't know what they were thinking about when they designed and included it."
4,Good product for the price,"The crate came in it's original product box, it was not placed in a shipping box for shipping so when the crate arrived, the box package was torn open in a couple of places. Thankfully, the product was not damaged inside. Other than the shipping method, I am very satisfied with this product. It is a really good size for my dog, it goes together very quickly and folds back down for storage (if needed). I really like that the bottopm tray: #1 is plastic, #2 has a lip around it (in case of accidents), and #3 has a latch that locks it in place or can be unlatched so the tray slides out very easily for cleaning. Overall this is a really great product for the price and I would recommend purchasing if you need a crate."
5,good cage,"this cage is wonderful, and it has a wonderful price. If you are looking for a good sturdy cage, you will not go wrong with this one, so just do it."
1,Impossible to Assemble,"This dog crate was nearly impossible to assemble. It looked as if the top may have been attached upside down. The panels fit so tightly that it was extremely difficult to hook the front and back panels to the top panel. I did finally get it assembled but the edges of the panels didn't really fit together quite right, and it would have been really hard to fold it up and reassemble it. The reason I purchased a wire collapsible crate is because I wanted to be able to fold it up to put it away or move it easily. Amazon was great with the return but I did not order a replacement from the Midwest company. Instead I've ordered a Pet Edge brand crate and am hoping it will work properly."
2,"Cheap, not inexpensive","This crate is cheap, and I mean in quality. It's much flimsier than any wire crate I've had in the past. The latch is a straight bar, rather than L shaped, which means with enough banging on the door, a dog could easily wiggle the latch open. It doesn't safety lock like an L shaped latch would. The plastic tray at the bottom is cheaply made as well. If you really want to save money, the crate will work, but I'd recommend spending just a little more on a better crafted crate."
5,Great Crate,Great crate. It's the perfect size if your will grow up to a large size. I can fit inside the crate with my pitbull puppy. Easy to assemble and the handles are great for when you are moving it. Divider perfect for when you want to train your dog. I plan on buying another for my dog and my brothers.
5,pet crates,"I ordered these so that I would have a crate for each of my cats in case of emergency. I have Ragamuffins, a large breed, so these are probably the smallest they could be comfortable in for more than an hour or so.The crates are sturdy and the cats like them. I made pads for the bottoms out of ""sherpa"" fleece and quilt batting so they all have comfortable beds which are washable. I leave two of them out in corners of the house at all times covered with pool towels for privacy so the cats feel comfortable and I don't have to catch them when they need to go somewhere. They take turns sleeping in the crates and play in and around them often."
5,dog crate,"I love this one. good price, good size for small dog. but one pannel was hard to put it together. my puppy looks comfotable inside."
4,Works Great,"We got two puppies for xmas and it works great. Really easy to put together, the puppies just love it they go right in."
1,disappointed,Very thin gauge wire crate--poor quality--- bends easily and only has one barrel bolt to keep door secure.I would not suggest this crate for a puppy due to the door issue.Quality is just not in this item.
2,Wouldn't buy another,I bought this product for my 50lb Aussie mix that I rescued last week. After 5 days she figured out that she could ram herself through the seam at a corner and escape. The metal is now bent out of shape and she can get herself out at will.. I am going to try and use zip ties to keep her in today. I wouldn't recommend this product for any dog strong enough to bend the metal. Patrick
5,Great Lil' Crate,I bought this crate for our elderly Pug who's starting to have some potty issues. Good quality crate at a reasonable price & FAST shipping. Thank you!
2,One Glaring Fault,"Overall, it is as advertised, it comes together easily except for one that was slightly bent, and it works well for the dogs with one glaring exception: there are some rough spots on the slats, enough so that my min pin scrapes the skin off the end of his nose. That is crazy!!"
4,Additional divider great for growing pups,This is a perfect crate for a medium sized dog. My own seems quite content in it. It was very easy to set up and easy to disassemble. It comes with a handle so that you can transport it easily. The added divider is good for puppies who are not quite fully grown yet. I would suggest putting a bath mat in there so that they have a comfortable place to lie down.
5,love it!,"First of all, I love Amazon! This crate was so reasonably priced for such a well-made product, it's ridiculous! I ordered this on a Monday morning, it didn't ship until Wednesday, and by Thursday night, UPS was knocking on our door. It wasn't the easiest to set up (I needed a little elbow grease from the hubby), but overall it wasn't bad. My 13lb Dachshund seems to love her new crate.. so far, so good! Don't hesitate, you won't regret it! :)"
5,icrate worth it,"This size is for a toy dog not a small dog, but this was my mistake. Other than that it shipped quickly and was easy to assemble (it came partially assembled). It is also sturdy, which frustrated our puppy. Will order bigger crate from them. It's a good buy."
3,Plastic hinges? Really?,"We got this crate for our new greyhound, not know how big she would be. She was less than 60lbs. We put this crate together before we got her, and noticed the plastic hinges. While the crate assembled VERY easily, made so by the plastic hinges, we wondered about those hinges. While our new grey is not a chewer, if someone had a dog that chewed, those hinges would be toast. As it was, our new grey did NOT like her crate at all, and bent the bottom of the door opening her first night. After less than 2 weeks, that crate was in the garage, and our grey has freedom throughout the house. So the plastic hinges and the easily-bent frame is why this crate got only 3 stars. But it did just open up to assemble; very easy."
3,Sturdy??,This crate is large enough for our growing Mastiff. It however is not a very strong kennel. We had to reinforce it to keep it more solid with zip ties. When the pup would get excited it would almost fall apart. We purchased a different kennel for our other pup and it was much stronger and included three door latches. For the price I am pleased as you get what you pay for.
4,Decent quality,"We purchased this for a larger dog then the one we currently had. It works good, was kind of bent up and is flimsy compared to the other one we have. Recommend a crate pad so dog can get some traction on the plastic slippery pan. I suppose for the price it is a good value."
1,worst kennel ever received,"We have ordered several of these crates in the past. They rust very easy. Can't be used on a daily basis.When we received this crate one side of the box was retaped. We should have seen this as a red flag. We did not need the crate immediately, and after opening the box, we saw that the tray was broken. It was clear that this box had been going through some rough shipments. We had to use a lot of force to open the crate, since the little hooks where completely bend. This will definetely be the last purchase I have done of these crates."
1,dog crate midwest,plastic dog crate tray breaks easily. I have a 50 pound boxer with no anxiety problems broke tray with the first use. Why would you have a rather flimsy plastic tray with a dog crate.
5,3 Happy Chihuahuas!,I ordered 3 of the crates for my three little Chihuahua girls. They love them and so do I.They are so easy to put together and they arrived so fast. I got the 18 x 12 inch size. I removed the doors and used heated cat beds inside and covered the top and sides with a blanket so they have their warm little cave during the day but sleep with me at night. They immediately went inside and don't even come out to sit on my lap. The cages do not rattle and are just wonderful. I would recommend them wholeheartedly although I am opposed to locking any dog in a crate for all day or extended periods as it seems cruel. I am completely sold on Midwest iCrate!
1,Punctured my dog,I bought this cage about 3 weeks ago. I came home yesterday to find my dog laying upside down with her paw stuck up in the air with one of the metal bars going through her paw. Very disappointed with the quality of this cage.
4,Perfect for my 1.5 pound yorkie,"I ordered this for my tiny puppy, and it is great. I did not give it a 5 out of 5 only because the latch is a little challenging to lock and unlock. I have a larger sized crate and the latches are very easy to use. But it is not a major issue, just have to use a little more muscle power. I would recommend this product for very small puppies or dogs and cats. Sturdy, easy to set up, quick delivery, lightweight, overall a great product."
4,Well built,Crate works out good. Seems to be built out of durable materials. Plenty of room for our minature dachshund to relax in.
2,I wouldn't recommend it for the size of dog it's intended for.,"I bought this for my Miniature Pinscher. He was past the point of needing to be crated, but I didn't want him running free throughout the night keeping me awake; therefore, I bought him this giant sized one. It would definitely be too flimsy (IMO) for the size of dog it was intended for."
2,Disappointed in quality,Shortly after receiving this crate it started to rust. The whole front of it is rusting badly. Our dog (who is only 17 lbs) can easily bend the bars and push the door out. She can also undo the sides where it is held together.
2,Black oily substance all over crate and ignorant packing method,"When I opened the box, I was unaware that they had put black oily grease all over the crate. Maybe there was a reason for this. Although I cannot think of one. And even if there was, WARN YOUR CUSTOMER. I suddenly had black grease all over me and everything I was wearing. I am still finding gobs of it hidden in places on the crate. I don't dare touch it for fear more will come off.Secondly, the partition is packaged in the middle of the crate. Getting the crate assembled and the partition out is a needless exercise in frustration. The hooks on the partition keep getting stuck in either the roof or wall of the crate. This was pointless since the partition could easily have been packaged with the liner. It took me 20 frustrating minutes to do what would have only taken me two if this was not how they packaged it."
4,Just what I needed/Some what difficult to put together,I bought this for my 5 month old maltipoo Chloe. I had some difficulty putting the product together because of how the free divider and door were stuck together. Yet over all I was able to put it together once I got around that little hiccup. It is a really nice size crate and there is additional room behind the divider. I'd recommend this product to any small dog owner and you can't beat the price. The same sized crate cost thirty to fourty dollars in my area.
3,Delivered w/ broken clasp,"When I opened the iCrate box there was a rusted/worn out clasp broken off of the crate. Other than that, I love the iCrate product as my other dog has had one for a while."
5,$40 cheaper than PetSmart,"Perfect travel crate for a gigantic Maine Coon who likes to ride in the car. The plastic bottom slides out and has a front clip to prevent slippage when in use. It's sturdy and collapsible. Along with the 20oz Snapy-fit bowls, we travel all over the country together."
5,No complaints!,No reason for a long review... no complaints... got this crate after the 'squeeze pin' for the gate broke on another crate I had. This one has a much simpler locking mechanism so should last much longer. And I like how my dog can see out easily. She sleeps in it at night (we can't trust her while sleeping to not wander and go pee)... and also during the day while we are at work. She is perfectly willing to come to us and run right inside this crate so she must be ok with it!
3,"not perfect, but my shiba inu likes it..","item arrived fast but it was not securely packaged to protect it from being damaged during transit. they just put a shipping label on the original box (which was not in good shape to begin with). item was easy to set up within minute. there are some notable damage on the crate like bent wires that most likely resulted from the lack of properly securing the package during shipping; but my dog likes it because it replaces his old crate that is only 1/3 the size of this new one, so i decided to keep it. would recommend the crate/item and i hope future customer receive better handling than i did for this item."
3,Nice but a little weak,"The crate is large for the pit that we have and looks good. However, the construction is a bit weak in some areas (like the locking mechanism and joints for example). Nevertheless it works as advertised."
5,Great price!,"I have a small Maltipoo (under 5 lbs) and have had the hardest time finding a crate for him. The ones I did find were way overpriced, that was until I came across this one. This is a great crate, a perfect size for Teddy. It was very easy to set up (I didn't even need the directions..just unfold the product) and the price can't be beat! :)"
4,Sandy's Crate,"The crate is worth the value you are paying for. Sometimes we have to push the hindges back into place, but that's only after we have moved it. It's convenient and easy to move. I would recomment this product. My doberman enjoy's it."
5,Pet Crate,"Oh my goodness! This crate was the solution to my big problem with my newly adopted taco bell dog (can't spell the other!) He would have accidents all over the house at night when everyone was sleeping; he would chase the cats; was just completely out of hand. Several ""time outs"" in this crate solved the problem. When he first moved in here, he spent the hours no one was at home inside this crate. He,unfortunatly, was one who didn't really care where he was when he needed to pee or poop, so that theory animals don't pee or poop where they sleep he didn't know about! Or maybe just didn't care! but it helped to teach him some control and now he's only crazy when he wants to go for a walk. But it is still his ""time out"" spot, with the door open. If he is exceptionally bad, the door is closed so he can't sneak out.This is the best crate, not too small, not too big. Easy to set up. Easy to clean. Really thankful I found it, and Bailey is thankful too. Made his life a little more controlled!"
1,My new dog is a Houdini,"You buy a crate expecting it will confine your dog; crates should be made with the expectation the animal will at least make a token attempt at escape. I adopted a 55-pound pit bull and purchased this crate. It took Gemma 15 minutes to work free the first time. I examined the crate and found I had assembled it correctly. By the fourth time, she'd determined a quick escape method and could escape in 5 minutes. At least I know she's intelligent and amenable to training."
4,"Easy to assemble, travels well.",This crate was delivered sooner than I expected and was exactly as advertised. I have been very pleased. The only negative might be that it is constructed of lighter material than one I had bought in the past. This does make it easier to handle when moving or traveling.
3,fast shipment just an ok product,"Very easy to assemble, fast delivery but not the best quality. The paint is coming off after just a month of use and the lock has issues."
3,Eh...,"This is an OK crate. Small and light with a nice handle. It's nice to use when transporting. The plastic tray slides out on the bottom which makes clean up a breeze when you have a puppy.However, upon arrival I noticed that the box corner was heavily damaged. Inside the plastic tray on the bottom was cracked. The whole cage is bent, and some of the welds are broken. I don't know at what stage this happened, whether it was shipping or it is just cheap.Still pretty good for how cheap it is."
2,Be Aware,"Use with caution. I would love to love this crate and give it five stars and would except for the fact that, unfortunately, as other viewers have mentioned, it is possible for a puppy or very anxious dog to catch their mouth or paw in the areas where the sides connect. As you can see in product photo, there are smaller spaces of wiring at top and bottom corners that connect the sides of cage. It would be better designed if there were smaller mesh for entire cage area preventing the dog from even being able to get mouth or paw into the spaces. My puppy yelped when he briefly caught his paw at the top front corner. He has calmed down enough now and is very comfortable in this crate with his ProSelect Pawprint Dog Cage Cover and Pad Set in black that I also purchased on Amazon for an amazing price, and is a very good match for this crate! A friend of mine also owns this crate (and same cover/pad set) but never mentioned this happening to her hyper Jack Russell or mini Aussie, so just be aware."
5,Super product,"Super, super, super product. Similar products sell for 100+ dollars at certain large chain stores. It is of superior quality, free shipping, easy to set up, big enough for me and my pitbulls, lol!"
5,Wonderful crate at a great price!,We upgraded from a smaller crate when our puppy outgrew her other. It is used everyday while we're at work.we're even able to fit a bed in there for her.
2,USED PRODUCT,"I ordered a NEW crate! They sent me a beat up/bent up crate that was clearly returned and sent out to me. The ONLY reason that i'm giving it two stars and not one is because after bending/tweaking the crate into shape, it's served it's purpose without harming my puppy. I feel i'm being generous."
3,Don't suggest for larger/stronger dogs,I have a 65LB AMSTAFF who isn't fond of being in a crate and he broke out after day one. I tried wrapping all the corners where the sides meet with a wire mesh to keep him from breaking out. This worked however the cage is severely disfigured and dented/bowed. It isn't strong enough for him. When he finally destroys this crate I will look into one of the solid plastic ones or something with thicker/stronger wire mesh.
5,Best pet crate for the price,We have one of these at home and our new little rescue dog feels very comfy in it.We ordered a second one to keep at our beach cottage so she would be comfortableThere as well! She loves to nap in there and goes in on her own when she wantsA break from from the crazy humans! Sometimes I think she would close the door herselfIf she could!
5,"Wow, how easy was that?","I am thrilled with this product. It took me about 5 seconds to set it up (huge difference from the drop pin crate I was using), and it fits my 20 lb mini schnauzer perfectly. A great deal compared to in store prices at the big chains."
1,Really..?,"I bought one of these crates a few months back and was very happy with it. I'm getting another small dog so I decided to purchase another one. Well the sides on this one do not line up evenly, the divider doesn't fit, and the latch doesn't line up so it won't even close. I guess the exact same product doesn't always mean the exact same quality."
1,Warped Crate/Quality Material,"I was very impressed upon opening the crate & seeing the quality of material. It did not however take long for disappointment to set it. It was difficult to get walls up because they were bent. After finally pulling them into place & trying to latch the three doors, I discovered that none of the latches would slide. All 3 had to be forced to latch the crate. One latch was so bad that it left marks on the slide. I am returning this one & purchasing same brand with only one door hoping for better crate this time."
5,Perfect,"We ordered this for our German Shepard/Collie mix puppy. She was 9 months old at the time and in the destructive puppy phase. After she chewed THROUGH a wall while we were at work, we knew we had to give in and buy a crate for her while we were at work. We both felt bad about having to do it until this thing showed up. It's HUGE even for her. She is comfortable in it and doesn't even whine for the most part when we have to put her in it. Best price by far as well. We love that it is collapsible for when we travel. We will be ordering a smaller one for a Pom-Chi soon."
4,"Good quality, and very easy installation !","Very Happy with this product, and the price! I think my little dog will be quite happy with this crate."
2,Not for a smart dog,"Our dog was pretty smart. And in this crate the latch doesn't really latch. Our dog would only have to paw at the latch a little bit and would be free, the door is too easy to open"
3,Worth the cost but not much more...,"I bought this crate for my small dachshund since, right now, we only have a travel crate for him and wanted for him to be able to see his surroundings better. This crate is the same size as our travel crate but I found it to be just a little too small for him. He is full grown and can stand, turn around etc. in the crate however, because he is so long, I would like a bigger crate for him. With that being said, I probably would have kept it anyway had the wire not been damaged. There was some kind of dent which caused the wires to bend and create inconsistent spacing. The crate says right on the box ""economy"". It was somewhat difficult to put together and take apart, and the door was stiff opening and closing and difficult to lock. The quality is what you would expect for the price... Economy. Amazon was great about returning the damaged crate so while I'm disappointed with the purchase, I'm once again thrilled with Amazon's customer service."
2,Poor construction,I gave this two stars because of the door construction. All the sides are not straight - and slightly tweeked just enough to make it hard to open and close the latch on the door. This is not a big deal during the day when it is light and I can see - but at night in the dark when my puppy has to get up multiple times to go outside - it makes for a very frustrating night just getting the door shut properly.
5,Great choice,Excellent. Set up is a breeze. (5min) Much easier than prior similar models bought at Pet Shop chains. Nice and sturdy.
5,Really nice cage,"when i first got it, i thought i have to assemble it, but you don't need to.those cage walls can fold in, so when you don't need to use the cage, you can simply fold it and store it somewhere else. very sturdy, the cage door shuts and locks fine. overall i recommend this."
5,"Very nice crate, this thing is huge!!","Just received this crate, took 2 days to get here. I love the divider, I didnt even know that I order the one with the divider, but the puppy really seems to like the smaller area. As another reviewer says, It is very large. I think it might be big enough for our two dogs once the puppy is fully trained, since they are inseparable. I am not sure if the locks are going to be a problem, might be too easy to open, we will see. This was to replace a crate from our local Walmart(very wobbly feeling, but basicall the same price), this seems sturdier."
4,Great potty seat,"The reason I like this one is because it's really padded and potty training kids tend to sit there a really long time. The size of the opening is fine for my kids all the way up until they could handle the toilet without a potty seat (around age 3 for us). Actually, I have found others to have a smaller opening and that doesn't result in good things.The one con to this seat is it can leak where the seat attaches to the splash guard. This has happened on two of ours so far. That's easily fixed with caulk if you don't mind dealing with it. Or you can not bother with it, but it makes for a little bit of a mess at times.Mainly I recommend it because it is ultra padded and comfy for the little ones."
2,Leave a ring of pee.,"The seat is inexpensive and soft. Also easy to clean. But it has to be cleaned every time its used, as well as the regular toilet seat underneath. It leaves a ring of urine around the regular toilet seat almost every time. Cleaning the toilet a half dozen times a day is driving me crazy. Maybe if you have a girl, this would be an okay seat, but not for little boys, even when they ""point down"" as best they can.The bjorn seat is more expensive, but definitely worth it."
4,Perfect fit for our small round toilet,Finally I found a potty insert to fit our smallish round toilet lid. Other inserts that claimed they were for a standard size were just too big. It came with a simple peel & stick hanger that makes storage convenient. It is nice & cushy for our skinny 2 year olds bottom & there is no fear of him falling through. Wish it was not made in China that is my only negative comment. For that reason I only gave this product 4 stars.
3,Annoyed by the packaging,Talk about the need for frustration-free packaging! My husband and I almost got a divorce over trying to take off the plastic. You have to - get this - USE A SCREWDRIVER and UNSCREW the hinges to fully get the plastic covering off. We gave up and got in a fight. What a cruel thing to do to a buyer. I was so excited to see this cute toilet and kept saying to my daughter: Want to use your new potty? Just wait 45 minutes for mommy and daddy to lose their minds and get this plastic off. *sigh*
3,Too small for big kids & moves,"I bought this because of the good reviews here. Nice soft padded seat, but it's too small & unstable for an oval seat. It looks oval in the pic, but it's more round then oval in person. It is VERY small compared to other soft seats out there.I think this would be great for kids under age 2 that you were placing on the potty, but my son at 3 is too big & no way would I let him get on it independently. I also would not let him sit on it without my being right there. It's very wobbly. I will spare the details by just saying the hole is too small for all things to fit through :)I found a 3-1 potty with a removable soft seat that is working better for us now.In summary. Perhaps good for a girl who is small & will have a mom holding her on it."
2,Not for elongated toilet!!,"I bought this product from Wal-mart because it said it fit standard & most elongated toilets. I'm not sure which elongated toilets it would fit b/c it was way to short for ours. There was a gap of 1-2 inches between the front of the potty seat & our toilet seat. Plus, it didn't sit stably into the seat. It's soft & comfortable, but definitely not for those who don't have a round seat!"
2,only works if you have a small round toilet,"the newer toilets on the market today will not accomodate this seat. the seat is made for older toilets that are small and round. also, the front part of the seat leaks if you happen to have a boy."
5,Mommy's Helper,This is just what was needed for my 2 year old granddaughter..I had another one but it was wobbly so when I saw this it was the one I needed. Fits perfect and does not move at all..I can hang it out of sight with the hook it came with when she is not here and it is also a nice looking little seat. Was amazed at the price couldn't believe how cheap it was. Wish I had it earlier!!
1,not for boys,"While this seat is a little small for the toilet seat, it fits enough that it would still be acceptable if my son didn't just pee right over the front ""guard."" We have a different seat in the kids' bathroom that I wish I could find again, because it works very well, but this one is pretty useless."
4,good idea,My son loves this seat. He feels like a big boy when he gets to use the big potty all by himself. I put the hook for the seat so he can get to it on him own and so this is ideal for him and it is nice because I don't have to wash out a little potty chair. The only thing that would make it nicer is if it had handles. Not a big deal at my house because the toliet is close to a wall so he uses that for support but I think it would make him feel more secure. I would recommend this for anyone with a child who wants to use the big potty.
3,The Bears Picnic,"I thought this book was cute for kids between the ages of 4-8. Its not a learning book, but its cute and it also rhymes, what kind of kid doesnt like a rhyming book? I read this book when i was younger, I thought it was so funny how they had to keep leaving the ""perfect picnic spot"". Now that I'm older I don't think its as funny. But it will keep any child occupied, i would recommend this book to any young child."
1,The Bear's Picnic,I was disappointed with the condition of the book. Pages torn & colored on. Not the condition I was told by the seller. I will not purchase fromthem again.
2,this book was kind of annoying,ok we get the point you couldn't find a picnic spot i mean wow that book was just ratteling on and on about how they couldn't find a picnic spot..
4,Cute & Colorful Care Bear Bath Book,"This is a nice item for your youngster's bathtub toy bin. It is soft and puffy, has colorful, adorable Care Bears on each page with a word associated with an object, and it holds up well to tough play, twisting, floating, all sorts of abuses kids impart on their books and toys. First Words included in the book are: TOY, HEART, STAR, BALL, MOON and FLOWER. I also would recommend the other three books in this Care Bears Bubble Book Series, i.e., Seasons, Shapes and Colors."
4,As ordered,These boxes are sturdy and good to jump on. I gave 4 stars because the little rubber feet on the bottom came off within minutes of being unpacked...not a huge concern but irritating.
1,The book in two sentences:,"A woman who's been convicted for giving false legal advice decides to write a book to share her advice with YOU.She was a bad mommy and the government decided to protect her kids, and now she's got a vendetta."
5,I only needed this book for school,i purchased this book for school and we hardly use it but i will say it is excellent
4,Friends and...B.B. King!,"In spite of an ecletical mixed of rythms,this work must reveal all of the influences and friends this man captivated along his career as one of the great musicians of all the times! One of the most beautiful things of the blues,is for me,the capacity to put together on a stage,a great number of distinct musicians,in a great spirit of confraternization,tha is an example for the mankind in this wartimes! B.B. King you really must always be with many many friends.You're fantastic man!"
4,Queen of the Dance Hall,"This is great hip-hop raggae from PATRA. QUEEN OF THE PACK displays some very, very tight funk with rapid-fire rap. My favourite track is THINK (About it) a J. Brown cover. It's all great. If you are interested in funk, hip-hop or music that moves and grooves, this CD will be interesting to you."
2,The Dawn of Dancehall,"A great album enhanced by collaborations with Yo Yo and the late Lyn Collins. Who knows when (if) Patra's rumored ""come-back"" will happen... in the meantime, get her debut disc. 2 & 1/2 stars."
3,Not too much bang for our buck,"I like this tea and normally order it from a different company. But since they were out of stock, I decided to try this one. Although Amazon does not mention what amount of tea is offered for the price, I decided to go for it and give it a try. I was very disappointed with the quantity because the other company gives you at least twice as much for almost the same price."
4,Great but too heavy,"I bought this drill to do some handy work around the house. I have used it to put up brackets for some curtains... I'm 5'3 and this drill is probably for a big strong guy. It is definitely a GREAT drill but way too heavy for me. I had to hold it with both hands, especially when you are reaching up. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars!"
4,Good Drill,"I've had this drill a little over a month now, and no problems at all. Mixing concrete, thinset, large wood screws are no problem. Very powerful drill. My only word of caution to others would be the drills weight. It is heavy, and not cheap; like most decent power tools."
4,gym in a drill!,"This is my third Makita drill. So far, so good. But for the occasional user, this model may be too heavy. Makita could break into the home gym market: dual use dumb-bells!"
5,Ricks Review,I think its a great drill driver I use it everyday and it has lots of power and one battery lasts a long time
2,Not happy with the batterys,"I ordered this drill because I have another one just like it. The batterys on my old drill,saw, sawsaw,flashlight, kit, I thought was bad and this new one came with 2 batterys, I bought it because the set was cheaper than buying two new batterys. It came on wedsday, both batterys was "" stone cold dead "" they charged for about ten minutes and the charger said the were fully charged. I couldn't drive an inch and a half sheet rock screw with them before they were dead again. I have been putting them on and off the charger for two days and they have come up some I can now drive about fifteen screws with them. Or make six cuts with my saw across a one by 12, I live in alaska and the shipment back is thirty bucks. The charger charged my old batterys up good in about 45 minutes and I worked all day with them. So I got something out of it, it will charge the old batterys. My old charger is bad. But I really don't need two drills with bad batterys."
4,Powerful and rugged,Ive used the 12v version of this drill for years and got this as a 2nd to have a drill and driver without swapping bits all the time.This 18v has incredible power and battery life. It comes with a 2nd battery which is a must. This one would would torque out of my hand before stalling.There are 2 functional features that were better on the older drills: 1) The chuck is all metal now and a bit smaller in diameter then the old style making it harder to grasp and tighten (old style was rubber with nice nurls to grab. 2) The drill to driver switch has a small safety afety switch that has to be pushed in before you can activate the slide switch. Its a total annoyance as a simple slide switch as is on the older models would have been just fine.
2,smoked and croaked,After using the makita for 6 months it smoked and croaked. I was unscrewing deck boards and after a hour and 1/2 I noticed it getting warm then suddenly began to smoke. My work partner was using a Miluakee 18 volt and it kept at it all day.
1,Bad chuck/spindle straight out of the box,"I bought one of these Makita drills, took it out of the box, pulled the trigger and immediately saw that the chuck/spindle was misaligned. Put a drill bit in it and the tip wobbled all over the place. I thought Makita was better than this. Guess not."
2,A small bundle of power,"I purchased this drill a couple of months ago and found it a pleasure to use. While I looks to be a similar size as other cordless drills, this drill is so well balanced that it does not feel big. The torque is great giving the power to drive long screws when needed, but sensitive enough to not strip out the heads. If I could, I would buy another to have a drill for both hands, but one is enough."
1,Lousy product,"I purchased a Makita 6347DWDE drill/case etc. some time ago and it sat in the case for some time. When finally unpackaged and after very limited use, I noticed that the batteries required recharging after minimal drilling or driving. This unit replaced an old 12V Bosch that I had for years and the battery longevities and performances were great. The Makita drill and batteries are like new in appearance, but the torque output is terrible (likely the battery problem described by other reviewers). I did not pursue trying to have the unit replaced as any real use was probably near or after the one year warrantee. Potential buyers BEWARE."
2,Battery Life Poor,"The tools work fine but the batteries do not hold a charge after a couple of years, this is with intermittent use. Considering the replacement cost of the just the batteries the product is not a good value."
4,Makita Drill / Driver,Powerfull light weight unit. Very quick charge on the batteries great for the work or home shop.
2,Dissapointed,"Transmission broke after three months of use. Had to buy a Porter Cable while I wait three business days for mine to be repaired. Being a diehard Makita guy I should have learned by now that while their saws and such are great, the drills still need alot of work. Too expensive for homeowner use, and kinda weak to rely on for the professional."
4,Confident Purchase,All women with little to no experience with tools will find this drill kit easy to understand and use. The only improvement I would suggest is providing an option to purchase additional bits.
1,Don't buy.,"The chuck easily strips out. The batteries went bad less than 8 months after purchase. The warrenty wasn't upheld and it cost me to have the chuck repaired after Makita gave me a service center that wasn't actually a service center.So a drill chuck that stripped out and cost money, 80 dollars to replace, and two batteries that don't hold enough charge to run two screws in after 8 months.""Assembled in USA"" and not ""MADE in USA"" like Makita used to be.I own well over 20 Makita tools and will never purchase another one after being duped thinking it would last and was made in USA like my previous tools had been."
3,Good while the Batteries LAst,"Let me say that the drill did perform well on all tasks: screw driving, drilling and hammer drilling. Problem was both batteries would no longer hold charge after eight months of use. They were most likely charge cycled about 25 times. I did use it alot for high current tasks such as lag screw driving and hammer drilling so the deep discharging my have something to do with it. May be a good tool for homeowner tasks. My Rigid 18 volt had better torque and the batteries are still working and its an older tool. I did notice newer Makita LiOn tools use a different style battery connection design thus your older tools (NiMH) can't use them. Rigid tools bought with NiMH batteries can be used with newer Lion batteries"
5,"Awesome drill, awesome price","Getting the 18v Ni-MH for the same price the 12v NiCd runs at Lowe's should be a no-brainer for most sane people, and the extra battery just sweetens the deal. Makitas are built like tanks, sit well in the hand and the only other brand of drill I'd ever even consider dropping this much money on is Milwaukee--the rest just feel like cheap (yet expensive!) toys.The only thing I can find to complain about is the fact that they don't throw in the magnetic chuck. I mean really, who's NOT going to want that thing? Stick it in the dang case already."
2,Short life span and frustrating problems,"If you are looking for an inexpensive DVD/VCR system to use for a couple years, this is a great deal. However, for greater longevity I'd look elsewhere. I've had this combo for two years almost to the day and the DVD player all of a sudden stopped reading the DVDs. My mother-in-law had bought herself the same system at the time and her VCR portion just recently stopped working. I called support and they could not help and suggested bringing it somewhere to have it fixed. Of course, doing that would cost more than just getting a new one. Another problematic element on this system is that the VCR portion will not record a different show than the one you are watching. I repeatedly called support about this problem and they kept saying to do the same thing over and over, to no avail. What good is that? My recommendation: splurge a little and get something that will last and that functions properly."
1,Problems with DVD playback,"For me, this unit immediately showed problems with playing DVDs longer than one hour. At approximately one hour, the movies froze followed by about a minute of head movement, then play continued on a random succeeding track."
2,Problem with finding replacement remote,"I like this player overall. It's great having one player for DVD and VHS. But the remote stopped working and I tried a few different multi-machine remote controls that are supposed to work with this system but don't. When I try to turn off the power with the new remote, it only switches from VHS to DVD or the other way around. If the company can fix this problem, it will be perfect."
3,"Good Perahia, bad piano","I have always admired Perahia, and on this CD only one thing is really annoying: The piano sound. Which is the usual thin CBS sound of the time, except here it sounds as if played on a really cheap audio cassette player from the sixties or seventies; the effect is called flutter, and seldom heard on CD. The original tapes may have deteriorated, perhaps? Try out track 6 before buying."
3,I suppose I'd give if three-and-a-half...,"I don't know, though. It does have a great many classic songs, but it also has some not-so-great numbers. By far the best song (and one of Suede's best songs period) is the sweeping Pantomime Horse, in all its strangulated beauty. Also of note are Moving, So Young, Animal Nitrate, and The Drowners--but then there are Sleeping Pills, Animal Lover, Breakdown, and The Next Life, which are really sorta mediocre. Don't get me wrong--I love Suede, and this is a good album, but it is a bit inconsistent. I'd start with Dog Man Star."
3,not bad...,"This CD is certainly decent, but once you're used to hearing The Smiths or Pulp, it can't quite match up. I love Suede's fast songs on the CD, they're fabulously done, but there are too many slower songs, and the trouble is that Suede's slow songs get a bit boring. This might be a great CD for some, but I thought it was lacking a little bit in its many slow songs."
3,Good start but the after track three it's bad,The first two songs are good especially animal nitrate but after that it is boring. Get there coming up album if you like cooler songs.
3,"Remarkable beginning, forgettable finish","By the time you hit song five ""Pantomime Horse"" you will be starting to wonder how this band did not go on to be a major international act. With the impossible styling of the lead singer and the wailing lead breaks of the guitar broken by sudden fragile piano runs it is not possible to listen unemotionally to this album.That is until song six. Just as you are settling down for a good listen - no, a great listen - the band ease off the unpredictable breaks and you get a murky, sodden wall of noise with few highlights.Buy it for the opening set of five. They've got more punch than most albums collectively. But forget the rest."
1,Compressed,"The deluxe edition of suede is the worst sounding album I've ever heard. As with all ""Deluxe Editions"" of this kind, they compress the hell out of it. Its noticeable from the very first hit of the drum in ""So Young"". I only buy deluxe editions for the extra tracks. Otherwise they sound like crap and should be avoided. Another victim of the loudness wars."
4,Beginning of a story,"I first heard this album when i was only 13,back then it had a huge impact on me-although in my eyes the follow up album dog man star overshadows this debut,its still a beautiful album,i think they would feel anoyed at the fact they are often harmlessley referred to as taking over where the smiths left, they are similar, but completely different at the same time. Buy this album is all i have to say-it keeps you dreaming,which is a good thing, but i must say i think without bernard butler the band are no more then average,which is a great shame."
4,"""Pumped Up With Valium-Could You Get Me Some?""","I saw the video for ""The Drowners"" and loved the whole jivey soap suds thing, so I bought the tape. Even though some of the sounds are a la The Smiths, Suede has created some beautiful, melodic and moody music on their debut. There is everything from rockin' guitar riffs to gorgeous piano lines, with Brett's sassy self leading the charge> I actually ended up enjoying some of the slower songs the best, like ""Pantomime Horse,"" ""Sleeping Pills,"" and ""The Next Life."" Some of my other favorites are ""She's Not Dead,"" ""Moving,"" and of course ""The Drowners.""It's bitter, it's sweet. OK, bitter-sweet. Thanks for some hauntingly delicious memories..."
5,Perfect album,"One of the great, great albums. Anderson and Butler were untouchable.Seeing them live when they were touring with this album was something you had to see to believe. They were jaw-dropping. I paid lots of money to have my guitar teacher help me learn how to play the songs on this album, and every penny was well spent. I will never tire of hearing this album. If you aren't knocked out by Bernard's hook on Animal Nitrate the very first time you hear it, well, I'm sorry for you."
4,Excellent,"With their eponymous debut album Suede joined the Smiths and Manic Street Preachers as one of the great thinker's bands. With a glam image, androgynous imagery in the artwork, songs and singing style, and an intellectual, thinker's side to the lyrics, it morally stood against everything Madchester was about, yet musically grew out of the Stone Roses heritage, but with more of a 70s Bowie influence stuck in there. Standouts included So Young, Animal Nitrate, The Drowners and Metal Mickey."
4,How things really are,"This book describes, in detail, life on your own. It talks about the various obstacles one will face when becoming independent, and some good ways to deal with them. Miller Stokes covers food, money, clothing, college expenses, health, nutrition and the pros and cons of owning an automobile. She describes how she faced her problems, but also how one should plan ahead so that they don't run into as many of these problems.This book is well written in a format that makes it easy for teenagers to understand the content and the language. She uses examples from her life to show that she has been through these obstacles, and uses advice to help others avoid these obstacles. This book is a boost of confidence because it opens your mind up to so many new ideas, and realistic methods of living. Many will enjoy this book just because it gives them a heads up about what is out there and waiting for them."
4,Fury Of The Mountain Man,"Good,very good! I enjoy the Smoke Jensen books and this is one along the same lines as the others when he goes to help out two Mexican gunfighters that he had met in another of his books. Of course being Smoke Jensen he ends up right in the middle of the fight. Good action and moves along well. The only thing I find I don't like is he refers back(sometimes a page or more ) from other books in the series too often. If you have already read the book he is talking about it can be boring, give me something new not the same old thing. But I enjoy the the way he puts things together with words so you can really see what is going on."
5,Clinch Moutain Shadows,"Fans of the ""O Brother..."" soundtrack take heed- Brothers Ralph and Carter Stanley weave a euphonious shroud of lyric grace and harmony rich with passion and sweet with pain. As a matter of fact brother Ralph sang a few songs on the ""O Brother..."" record (Brother Carter died in 1966), so if you enjoyed those you'll certainly dig these. God blessed these requiems for the Blue ridge mountain rain and that old home behind the hills...I highly recommend them."
5,The Complete Columbia Stanley Brothers,"Wonderful, deep, richly, harmonious songs. This is the real deal. ---- My favorite song on this cd is ""Gathering Flowers for the Master's Bouquet"" (m.e. Baumgardner) -It is just an incredible song. A truly beautiful, deep, soulful, uplifting song about death -- is haunting and wonderful. It will make you feel okay about your loved ones dying, and about you living. --- This song alone is worth getting the cd for ---and then you've got 21 other gems that go with it. --- 100 stars."
5,Great classic bluegrass,This is one of the best collections of bluegrass standards I have heard in years. What a find! Every true bluegrass afficianado should add this to their collection.
1,Cheap junk,"I purchased these tongs as I trusted the Lodge name and quality. After receiving them I realized they were cheaply made junk from China. No quality control and no customer concern or care. Like a lot of the Chinese products, they looked good, but it didn't last long. On the fifth BBQ use they just feel apart, no fixing them. I truly hope Lodge cares enough about their customers and employees to bring back their production to America. Their reputation and further growth depend on happy customers.Look for a better made product from another company. This isn't it."
1,Poorly Made,"Tongs are poorly made. Did not operate smoothly, would stick during operation and the gripper ends did not line up correctly. I had to take them appart and bend them into shape so the would work."
2,Not worth buying...,"After reading all of the reviews for this product, I thought I would be getting an excellent set of tongs. Initially I got the tongs so that I could grab charcoal out of my charcoal chimney. When I received these tongs I was greatly disappointed. My first complaint was that the tongs have no ability to grab or hold onto things. These tongs are comparable to my Weber Professional Tongs because they both grab things by the tip. I ended up having to flatten out the tips so that they have a better ability to grab. My next complaint is the spring that makes these tongs function is cheap and unreliable. My Weber Tongs surpassed these tongs in quality hands down (Better spring, better design, more quality). I have a 12 inch lodge dutch oven and love it! I expected better quality products from lodge. I wish that I would have seen these in a store so that I would have realized they were probably made in China."
4,Sturdy tongs for cooking,"Tongs are sturdy and fine for cooking at the campsite. Would be better to have a wood handle grip, as the metal tends to heat up when cooking over the fire. However the tongs are long and keep your hands at a decent distance from hot coals."
1,bad tongs,"I purchased two ""tongs"". Both tongs were bad. I sent them back.Cheap material and poorly assembled."
2,Low quality,"I was very suprised at the low quality of this knife. The small blade has a weird grind mark on the back side like someone slipped while grinding the blade. The blades don't fit well, the fly mate is way off. The scales are of different thickness from one side to the other. Overall, very low quality. Very sad example of ""made in U.S.A."""
3,"Works OK, not carefully made","The blade is sharp enough to use, but there isn't much else going for it.The two halves of the handle are not the same shape. One side looks like the picture, the other has a bulged out shape.The large blade has an out-of-place extra bevel near the base of the blade, as if someone accidentally bumped into the grinder."
2,Boring- Not Enough Kid Fun or Animals,"Cute cover doesn't make for a great or even good kid's movie. Movie starts slow, pretty much stays slow, amateurish, too many adults, drags and takes forever to develop and get some, if any, laughs out of our children.A notoriously, clever cat burglar named The Cat played by Luke Perry is sought out by the so called Jr. Detective who, of course, runs an internal monologue like true detectives of old. Yawn.The girl and cute dog on the cover don't appear until almost 40 minutes into the story. They help some, frankly, the beagle has to carry the show, but it's not enough, the dialogue and story are simply, forgive me, ""lame"".A plus, it is G-rated type material."
2,Wrong item-sent other item-not happy,"The advertisement was for the 10-777, which Stanley (manufacturer) had discontinued. I saw that this was available and purchased. I received the 10-778 which replaced the 10-777. The new knife is not suitable for our needs. That's why I wanted the old one. Lesson learned: call the company first before ordering."
2,I give up trying to change the blade,"I received this tool with no instructions. It worked great for about three months, then it came time to change the blade. I turned the thumb wheel but nothing happened, could not open the tool. There is a little yellow arrow on the handle which must mean something. I pressed it, pushed it, pulled it. Nothing happened.I finally forced the tool open, blades fell out, I can't get it put back together.I like the old Stanley, you take a dime, unscrew the cover, get a blade and put it in, this one I give up on."
5,Treasured Treasure,"Simply the best utility knife I have ever owned. I do not know what others are talking about when they say that it is easy to get cut while changing blades. As far as actually exchanging blades in the ""chamber"" its the same as any other old school type utility knife.It is safe. It is durable. The blade does not get caught in cutting object and pull out like push button retractables. If you spin the wheel as far back as you can, it will even lock the retractor. I have been searching near and far for this product. It is unavailable every where I look.Just like other tools, the best ones get forgotten. I wish Stanely/Fat Max would bring this one back."
1,Not worth it!,Changing blades with this knife is a pain. The spring loaded knob makes it especially problematic when changing blades. While installing the new blade it is highly likely that you are going to get cut.
1,Doesn't fit a 2006 Honda Accord EX-L V6 Auto,"This rotor is 12"" in diameter, but the O.E. rotor is 11"", therefore it doesn't fit. The rotor is over 1"" thick, but the O.E. rotor is less than 1"". This rotor is much too thick and is too large in diameter to fit into the housing! I'll have to return both rotors.Real bummer when you've got everything jacked up and disassembled."
1,Doesn't fit a 2004 Honda Accord V6 Auto,"This rotor is 12"" in diameter, but the O.E. rotor is 11"", therefore it doesn't fit. The rotor is over 1"" thick, but the O.E. rotor is less than 1"". This rotor is much too thick and is too large in diameter to fit into the housing! I've returned the part."
5,Guitar,This has been played so many times... I love it! Great to crank up or have in the background down low.
2,for lite new age fans,"Only 6 good songs worthwhile listening to on my iPod. For fans of lite, New Age, muzak. If looking for real Flamenco look somewhere else. Good to fall asleep or meditate to."
3,A Simple Tale,"This was a sweetly written, poignant story about the life of a women sent to Kalaupapa Leper Colony. Written in her later years very simply at times recalling the story of her life there. Not highly educational but somewhat enlightening. Very brief almost a pamphlet."
5,This book makes me cry each and every time I read it.,"This was a great book that details a common disease that is often overlooked, leprosy. It is the autobiography of a truly inspirational person. The book captures my heart every time I read it. I often need to have a box of tissue nearby when my tears begin to flow as they often do as I read this book, my most cherished possession"
5,"Olivia, My Life of Exile Kalaupapa",Excellent book. Very well written and could read the pain she suffered...the indignities. Shared this with a friend and she liked it too.
4,Better than ll Bean,I really like the hook and the vented pockets on the side. It packs flat and fits better in my suitcase.
1,Disappointed.,I was not satisfied with this product because I was expecting to receive zinc screw posts but received black screw posts. The image and product description were misleading. However shipping was quick and efficient.
2,Understanding Tough Love,"This book contains concise, instructive information on the topic. This information is couched in the Christian perspective. It would have been an easy read; however,unfortunately, the book is written poorly with many spelling and grammatical errors which may distract the reader from the content. The comments of ""experts"" on some of the chapters were interesting. The qualifications of the experts were their years of parenting children. This suggests a case for the utilization of mentors for the parents of troubled children. Not all can afford therapists."
4,UBERSTIX SAILBOAT Review,UberStix SailBoat kit is a very clever toy thgat can eaisly be extened into many different areas of model sail boating.
4,"Heavier, darker than Terje Rypdal","Just heard ""String Thing"" on last.fm, O.M.G.! WTF is that? Heavy, intense. Is it Rock? Jazz? Reminded me of some of Terje Rypdal's work, only heavier and darker. Must have it."
3,It's got some new stuff,"Definitely takes a different direction from Vol 5. More emphasis on the the scene, the lot, other ""jambands"", and folks in the fan community, and less emphasis on information about the band, their shows, and their music. Maybe Vol 7 will complete the transition and the PA can become what it began as, an exponent of fans rather than a focus on Phish."
1,"Goofy, but not good","Amateurish layout, inaccurate data, and a sour ethical history. Maybe check out an alternative?"
5,Underground-style printing makes this book special,"It's no secret in the Phish world that the authors of the Almanac crafted this book without any help from publishers, agents, or reps, and put out the single most informative book in the Phish community. Everything you could imagine and more is in this book, and it's homegrown feel will make everyone feel like part of the team"
4,Hair-raising Sea Stories,"This book is divided into twenty chapters--each chapter describes a different(supposedly true) sea story. As the title implies, all are astounding tales, but some more so than others. Mr. Snow was a historian; he dug deep to find unusual bits of world history. Readers won't be bored--each chapter veers off in a different sea direction. One chapter describes the life of Philip Quarll, the hermit who lived nearly 50 years on an uninhabited South Sea island. Another recounts Captain Salter's ill-fated encounter with Nootka Indians--the entire crew was massacred except for two men, John Jewitt and John Thompson. Mr. Jewitt kept a journal of his 28 month captivity before being rescued. The best story in the book may or may not be true, as Mr. Snow readily admits. Regardless, the tale of Ambrose Gwinett is truly an adventure worth reading about, and would make a fantastic movie. I enjoyed every account--it's fast, easy reading sure to keep any seadog's attention."
4,"read the ""nurture assumption"" first","The ""nurture assumption"" counterintuitively but persuasively points out the lack of influence of the parental home environment on personality. This lack of influence had been hidden by genetic effects which are only revealed using specific experiments, like twin studies.The first half of ""No Two Alike"" entertainingly takes wacks at researchers who try to refute the theories of the ""nurture assumption"" without properly controlling for genetic effects.The second half of the ""No Two Alike"" tries to explain the personality variance that remains after genetics is taken into acount. I think she is right that much of the remaining variance is due to interactions with a child's peers, but there isn't enough evidance to say for sure."
3,not his best,"I expect more from him, this album is weak. I was waiting for something hot like i know he brings and he never delivered. If u are a fan, good for your collection but if u are not up on him this isnt tha album to bump"
1,Distorted Facts,"I was very disapointed with this book. I purchased it with the intention of learning more about the singer for a feature article I am working on. When I did some fact checking with family members, including Harlene, and people whom he recorded and worked with, it became apparent that many facts were omitted. Was the writer's intent merely to sell books rather than tell a story based on a balanced view of facts? I don't know. After doing a little digging myself, this book to me comes off like a tabloid, not a biography.However, it does give way for a more balanced and factual based story which hopefully someone will tell some day."
1,jackie wilson,sorry i bought - could not get past first two pages. also the type of print used is not reader friendly if ones eyes are not the best. would have preferred if someone like david ritz had written since mr. ritz knows the people he is writing about.
1,sweet soul music-spinners,It was overall a bad performance dvd. I would not recommend this to anyone.Deeply disappointed with the performances
2,AWFUL!!!,"This is definitely NOT the Spinners that I loved!!! When I first saw them, my thoughts were ""WE DO GET OLD""!!! That's too bad, because it's time for them to hang it up! Not only are they out of tune, but they can't dance and their costumes were too ""colorful"" accompanied by flags and stars, to say the least -- they were awful! I guess they need the money. Also, not to embarrass anybody, but you'd think they'd get their teeth fixed with all the money they've made over the years. They get two stars, simply because they are ""WHAT WAS-ES."""
2,The Spinner's,Whoa! something about time that brings the reality of how old you are. The Dvd was one that I was looking forward to seeing. the great songs the moves . What I got was some nice singing and what should have been steps aided with walkers. How I miss the past and the Spinner's that I grew-up with.
4,Leap Frog ClickStart Animal Art Studio,"It was for my 20 month old grandaughter. The game is to hard for her to do at this time, but I think in the future she will enjoy it!"
2,Useless!,"Despite all of the rave reviews, Revitol did nothing for me. I applied it several times to my legs, once for upwards of 20 minutes using a thicker spread than other depilatories I've used and still it did nothing to remove hair. Perhaps it just doesn't work for me; others sound like they are having success. If it matters, I am biologically male, so my leg hair may be a bit thicker. But Revitol claims that this stuff works equally on both sexes."
2,A So-So So-n-So,"Not a great book, and not the best of the Rat pack. Harrison has a lot of fun making fun of modern foibles in the future, but the story is overly episodic, the technology of the future seems less advanced than our own (but for space travel), and the author's ideas about authority and responsibility come across as identical to those of a thirteen-year-old slacker. But the story is rapid, the cliffhangers well constructed, and the Bishop is a joy of a character."
3,Lost in translation...,Nowhere near as funny and/or irreverant as the first several books ... but a good read nevertheless. Perhaps HH got 'more serious' as time went on?
5,amazing with my bumper,My Trailblazer bumper color was getting worse and worse and I was looking for something to make it shine again without painting itThis product did an amazing job.I uploaded some pictures before/after.
3,"Good Idea, not so good guard","We thought this door guard would help our three children ages three and under stop shutting each other's fingers in the doors but we were wrong. The Doog Guard kept falling off the side of the door once our kids realized they just had to shut the door hard a few times in order for it to fall off. They also shut the door so hard that the door guard broke.Also, it did not prevent little fingers from being stuck on the inside of the door. The door was able to close enough to still get little fingers stuck there."
5,Work well,These door stops work very well. They stop the door with enough space so that little baby fingers don't get caught.
3,Breaks at the back leg after several uses,"Like most of the above reviewers, this product worked for a couple of times but then it broke after putting it on and removing it consistently. To be fair tho, the kid is 2 and pretty strong; and would push on the door with the panda on and this is when it broke, but I don't see that situation being avoided so it will probably be a recurring issue. I probably will just use the towel tip mentioned above."
3,100 ft cord,seems to be a little stiff at first but may loosen up as time goes on. First time plugged a portable air compressor into it and burnt the end off of both. Easy fix don't know which to blame for lose connection.
4,acceptably cheap,"This is not a 10/3 cord. The black and white wires are acceptably close to 10 gauge, but the ground is smaller than a 12. Keep this in mind as you think about this cord being about half price! The three prongs are rather well attached. I'd buy more of this."
4,"a classic, boring book",Don't read this book for pleasure. Only read it if you have to. It's useful if you have a good reason to read it.
3,"product great, service not so much","The product is beautiful. Unfortunately it came without the box and the tealight. As per Amazon suggestion, I contacted the seller. They offered 10% off the next purchase... through their website, not Amazon. This did not solve the issue. I had to contact them again and ask for the box and tealight (now too late for the gift giving as was intended). When that arrived the box was the wrong box. More trouble than it was worth when the shipping cost is almost the same as the item. Save yourself the trouble."
2,2001 MISTAKES,"I'm sorry but this film failed badly. At first it seemed very promising in the beginning, reminded me of a classic 80s slasher flick, but as soon as they arrive at Pleasant Valley the film falls appart. The costumes sucked, the atmosphere was bad, there were no scares, the jokes weren't funny, the acting was horrible, (except for Robert's, of course.), the death scenes were stupid, and the story was just really bad. I enjoyed watching the making of than the actual movie, and for some strange reason the shots of the set looked spookier in the making of than in the film itself, go figure. Hey I'm a die hard horror fan, and I was really looking forward for this film, but it let me down big time."
2,Will never replace the original H. G. Lewis classic,"I'm an almost-fan of the old Herschell Gordon Lewis gorefests, so I was curious to see how this updated version fared.None too great. Stoopid movie, but at least some of the characters were fairly entertaining -- at least on the maniac side. Alas for the poor, dull victims. Robert Englund played it up pretty good as Mayor Buckman, as did Lyn Shaye as Granny Boone. Not a smidgin of tension, but a lot of black humor that worked to varying degrees. It's hardly going to replace the old classic in any fans' hearts and minds, I'm pretty sure.But there's some mighty fine lookin' southern belles a-hauntin' in Pleasant Valley, I can tell you."
3,Was OK,"For a direct to dvd release, this isn't a horrible film. It reminds a lot of a cheesey 80's horror film like ""Chopping Mall"". You have a silly story which brings a lot of young people together in one place to have sex and get killed. For those who like gore and nudity in their horror, then this one is for you. The story is fun enough to keep you interested, and it has a slight surprise at the end. The gore is pretty good old school effects, but nothing to blow you away. You will be surprised at how many known actors you spot in the film anchored by horror veteran Robert Englund who relishes his role. This one is worth a watch and possibly a buy if you enjoy 80's style horror."
2,Inersesting if silly little horror movie,"Bloody, disgusting and a little tongue-in-cheek. Not too bad for the silly, bloody, campy horror genre. Certainly no one's idea of a great horror movie but kind of fun."
3,Fans of campy horror films will enjoy it.,"If you hold this movie up against standard horror classics like The Shining or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you will be disappointed. However, if you're looking for a fun, gory romp for a late night - this will appeal to you. I especially enjoyed Robert Englund's performance, which almost justifies this movies' existence by itself."
4,Buy it!!,"Thoroughly enjoyable, great array of Hollywood newcomers. Of special note was ""Kat"", Gina Marie Heekin, she is ""hot"" and talented too."
4,love it,"some reason i just like this movie, some more skin would have been nice, i just enjoy it, don't really know why, or do i care..."
4,pretty good low budget horror,i rented this movie cause some of the death scenes looked cool and they were the only thing that keep this from a 5 star is the annoying accents and the setting. if your a fan of blood and gore and dont mind a lower budget than usual you should enjoy this film. the ending death scene is very creative and original
2,JOLLY OLD ENGLUND,"A remake of the Herschel Lewis cult favorite, 2001 MANIACS is certainly not for the weak of stomach. We get the horse-quartering of a young nymphet; a spear up the butt of a bisexual hunk; acid down the throat of another stud; a bell dropped on a Chinese chick; and the cotton mashing death of another youth. And not to mention the devouring of the bodies.The movie is so over the top that it becomes humorous but even Robert Englund can't Freddy up any real terror. I dont mind gore and guts in a movie, but this one just has a little too much without offering anything new to the cannibal and/or zombie genre."
5,"A Rip Roaring, Bloody Good Time...","It is refreshing to see how far a horror movie is willing to go in this time of the FCC. And it is fantastic to see a movie so UN-PC that its not afraid to offend. Face it, good horror movies usually are not vast crowd pleasers. But for a true horror movie fan this is your movie. The gore is over the top but is used well in the context of the movie. And the T&A is all over the place, let's hear it for the ""Kissin' Cousins"". And to top it all off the acting is very credible, I dug these folks and obviously Robert Englund and Lin Shaye really stood out. I won't give away to much of the movie but I will say this, do yourself a favor and buy this baby. Tim Sullivan... you rule!"
4,Nice one,"After reading some of the reviews here I had to give this one a chance. Well it is pretty good and I was not disappointed. There is plenty of gore, nudity, and humor-together they make a good combination. If you are a fan of Robert Englund or horror movies, give this one a try it's pretty good, some of the craziest deaths I've seen in a while."
5,Yay!,"Robert Englund, the old south, cannibals, what more could you ask for? Did you say hillbillies playing banjos don't worry this movie has them too! Sooo worth a watch or 10!"
5,Fun Scary movie!,A good scary movie that was fun to watch! Bad southern accents and cheesy song and some bad acting makes it more of a comedy than Horror movie. I enjoyed seeing the town that is only about 35 miles from where I live.Do not watch with small children ( nudity and gore).
2,See it for only one thing!,"The movie has a good plot but the editing was done by none other than a rank amateur. This movie stinks in the worst way. I'd recommend a rental of this garbage only to see the killing scenes which are imaginatively done. For that, I gave this manure two stars."
3,LODGE 2-PIECE HOT HANDLE HOLDER SET,THE HOT HANDLE HOLDERS ARE TOO SMALL AND HARD TO MANAGE. THEY ARE VERY COLORFUL BUT NOT TOO USEFUL.I WOULD HAVE RETURNED THE PRODUCT BUT DID NOT WISH TO GO THROUGH THE PROBLEMS OF RETURNING.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.
3,Caution for those with gas cooktops,"After using this a few times with a Lodge 10"" skillet on my gas cooktop, I noticed the edge nearest the pan (and the flame) was actually burned away. It seems that our cooktop's big 13,500 BTU burner is just ""too hot to handle"" for these. If you have a gas cooktop, just be aware of this before purchasing.But since it's undoubtedly more convenient to use one of these than putting on a mitt every time, and it's really necessary to use something for protection, I just keep the skillet slightly off-center with the handle an extra 1/2"" away from the flame to avoid damage. However, I do wish there was a more robust, flame-resistant version. Maybe the ones without a design are more heavy-duty?Also, I notice that the price has more than doubled since I bought a pair in 2009 for six dollars (and yes, I also got free shipping). At the current price of more than twelve, even with free shipping these seem a bit expensive, but I guess they're still worth it for safety."
5,Helps you not burn your hand....seriously - you need these,"If you own cast iron cookware (i.e. Lodge) - you need these. Not designed to be left on during cooking (I have ignited them before) but perfect instead of juggling hot pads that can slip on and off. Hey, these pans get hot (500 plus degrees) and you get two of these for frequent use. Plus - they have cool designs. Highly recommended for the cast-iron chef (who also increase their iron and hemoglobin with every use of these pans!)"
2,be careful!,"We've had these hot handle holders for over a year now. They were actually quite convenient - I say ""were"" because of a recent incident.One of my holder's burst into flames last week! I was using the holder while making pancakes in my cast iron skillet. My toddler called me to the bathroom, so I turned off the burner, but left the skillet on the burner.Two minutes later, I here my 8 y.o. yell from the kitchen ""Mom! Fire!"". I ran back to the kitchen and sure enough, the holder was in flames! I put out the fire - the holder is totally trashed . . . I'm not sure if these shouldn't be used with a cast iron skillet, or maybe not with gas heat . . . I was totally dumb-founded as to how a fire could start with the burner actually turned off . . . anyway, I don't want any one to burn their house down! So beware!And yes, I am totally serious!"
5,works as advertised,"it works like a handle holder should, pepper design is nice, ive seen it before on other kitchen stuff like mittens and towels"
5,Small but necessary!,"This may seem like a small thing but it is absoulutely necessary if you have cast iron pans. It will save your hands and fingers from burning a thousand times over. You used to be able to pick these up almost anywhere, but this is the only place I have been able to find them now. Well worth the small cost to save your skin! Highly recommend."
1,probably doesn't work,"I have been taking Sytrinol for over two months and tested my cholesterol a few days ago. I was expecting a 20-30% reduction, but instead my cholesterol reading was much higher. I took the test twice more to make sure and it came out the same. I have not otherwise changed my diet in this time, so my conclusion is that Sytrinol most likely does not work at all. Given that it is flagged up as a major ingredient of this product, I would be wary."
3,"Great value, but NOT professional-quality.","When I bought these Mayhew pliers, I got a great deal through Amazon...but I did not realize just how much thicker the metal is on certain other companies' hose clamp pliers with the same design. If these will sit in your garage for years in between uses, they are fine for you. However, if you fix cars for a living, do not buy these pliers, which Mayhew did not make, and which come from France. They are NOT strong, like the American-made Mayhew tools have always been.When I worked all day as a mechanic, I used to have an S-K tool just like this, also made in France Like this Mayhew tool, it had thin metal in the area that touches the hose clamp ears. It broke shortly after I started using it,right at that spot, although we did not abuse it at all. I am sure this one will, too.Look at the competitors' versions. Many will have flimsy jaws, like this one does, but others will not. Get them instead of this one."
5,NICE!!!!,"I was pleased with this knob, as the last one I bought on amazon was cheaper ""and you can tell"" I have this on my Corvette now. Its a clean looking and pretty big as thats what I was wanting. But yes its a pretty good deal."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I'm very sorry to say that this DVD was not what I was expecting and I was very disappointed by it. I am a Twilight fan and I have taken two trips to Forks. The best part of this DVD were the few interviews with the owner's of the ""homes"" of Bella, Edward and Jacob, the owner of Dazzled by Twilight, the owner of Bella Italia, and others who live in Forks. Had the entire dvd had this type of content, it would have been well worth it. Most of the rest of the video was people waiting in line for Twilight movies talking about the saga and then, the last 15-20 minutes of the dvd, it tried to be an art film. The shots of areas in Forks could have been great, but with frequent changes in focus, bad music, and effects that really were not needed, that part too was a let down. The dvd had no narration which I think would have added to it. It could have been great, but it was far from it. Hopefully others will find enjoyment in a dvd which I did not."
2,Nothing I'd want to watch again,"I am a huge Twilight fan too, but after wasting money on ""Twilight in Forks"" (which thankfully was only $5 more than buying New Moon alone) I decided to check this out from the library first. Good thing too because, while I think part of it would make a mildly interesting made-for-TV type thing, I can't see myself ever wanting to pull it out and watch it a second time. (Actually, I only watched Twilight in Forks once too.) I am writing this while the DVD is still playing because I would hate for anyone to spend money on this. It seems to me it's just another attempt to cash in on the Twilight craze. I am currently on the last segment which as Dawn K.M. mentioned is just a bunch of outdoor scenes with weird new-agey music in the background and it's been going forever already (okay, maybe 15 minutes but it's not over yet). Oh look, there's a spider. Oh look, a babbling brook. Dumb."
3,Buy it for first half of video only,"I was disappointed in this one. The first half of the video you follow the truck Forks uses as Bella's around the town to see a few points of interest and listen to some of the locals talk. That part is OK for the Twilight fan. The waste come in with the second part, several minutes worth of nature that doesn't seem to have much to do with Forks or Twilight. It might be pretty and it isn't desert but it has no value.Destination Forks is a better ""tour"" video over all."
3,Forks deserves better,"As someone who has stayed in Forks - before Stephanie Meyers made it famous- I have to say that it deserves a better movie. It is a great little town, though somewhat depressed by a faltering lumber economy. (It is primarily a lumber town although it also supports sport hunting and fishing- it is the main community for the northwest part of the Olympic Peninsula). If you go be prepareed for rain- Forks is not that far from actual rainforest. All of which is another way of saying that a movie about a place so endowed with wonderful and varied countryside should have been shot better and had a better soundtrack."
3,Was it a help?,"I don't know whether this book was exactly what I was looking for. I didn't finish it even though I pushed myself. I lost interest and found it like a school text book - one you have to read but wouldn't normally go near. But, for the writers sake, I might not have been the best person to judge this."
5,An Essential Book for the Writer,"I just finished reading ""Toxic Feedback"". I found it fascinating, full of humor and wisdom. The chapter ""The Power of Positive Feedback"" was especially strong because one could see the action of positive feedback in the exchange of letters. Very convincing, even if the whole exchange was made up. My wife and I have acquired many books on writing over the years, but this is one of the handful on the 'must have' list because it addresses a central issue of the writing life in a helpful way."
3,Soundtrack Is Great!!,"This is one of my favorite b-comedy movies from the 80's, but really sticks with me about this movie is the soundtrack,particularly the closing song which I can't figure out who proformed it. It's a classic 80's jam! Anyone know where I can find out?!"
3,odd jobs,when i order this there was only one reason for it that richard dean anderson was in it. i didn't exspect that he was only in it for a few moments.i find that the movie was boring and predictable . i would sell it in a yard sale if richard dean anderson wasn't in it even for a few moments was worth it other than that it sucked.
2,"pretty, but poorly made","This scooter is lovely to behold (we got it in aqua), but we are returning it to buy something more durable. The front wheel keeps falling off and the whole thing seems likely to fall apart at any moment (and not for lack of attention when assembling it). Putting my money toward something sturdier for my little girl!"
4,Yay! A good good record.,"After promising ep's and really fun live shows, the Virginia Dare puts this record out, fulfilling all my expectations. Idiosyncratic, detatched from any particular 'scene' of music, this is most like their friend Barbara Manning in its insular, almost Cohen-ey dark singer songwriterness. Best autoharp rock album ever, creepy and warm at the same time. I tape this for my friends, they go out and buy it without fail."
3,Buyer Beware,You may now see that the description of this item has been changed to indicate that it is a cd single. At the time I ordered it was shown as a box set including all the tracks on each cd. So I thought (like an idiot) that I was getting the cd. So nice as this is I am naturally disappointed. Be careful what you order.
3,the bracket is a problem,"The lamp is of good quality, but the clamp/bracket (as others have mentioned) is sub-par. Yes, the bolt's a bit undersized and the hole for the lamp base is too large. For my purposes, the biggest issue is the lack of a 90deg position for use on desks and shelving with vertical boards for clamping. We had to cannibalize the clamp from my 20-year-old swing lamp to install this new lamp."
1,Not that great.,I own several of these and they don't hold up very well. The lamp head snapped off on one and the power switch broke on another. These are too expensive for this shoddy quality.
1,Poor quality poor craftsmanship.,"Bought this lamp following posted reviews. Unfortunately my lamp arrived with loose bolts. I tried to assemble it but without the correct nut and bolt was unable to do it. So I was unable to use it. Since I live outside the States it was quite expensive to send it back so it was not an option and had to throw it away. It really stands up to ""made in china quality""."
2,cheap Chinese junk,"When this lamp arrived, it was missing several nuts and screws,and the lamp arm fell apart--I managed to repair this withsmall parts I had on hand, but for the price I shouldn't havehad to.Contacting the manufacturer is ridiculous, since they are inChina, and the local address is just a warehouse.Not worth the price, yet I cannot return it because I need the lampNOW, and cannot wait 3 weeks for a replacement. I should havepaid the price for a reputable brand."
1,Mammoth Blues,"I ordered this great looking Wooly Mammoth for my collection. It looks very much like the famous Charles R. Knight painting-in the picture...I can't rate this toy, because I never received it. They sent me the Baby Wooly in error, and didn't feel like messing with it to return it. Shipping would be about as much as just buying the toy I wanted. The baby Wooly is OK, I guess, but, not what I wanted. I may try again for this item, but, through another vendor. Very disappointed."
1,Hypocritical,He complains about bias but yet that is what makes up the majority of his book. The author seems determined to demonize anyone who's opinion deviates from his own.
2,So very disappointing (`cause I agree with him),"So very disappointing (`cause I agree with him)Terrible book. Not because his thesis is a bad one (it's spot-on), but because it's so poorly written and poorly argued. The book just turns into a rant.There are very good arguments to make against these professors: their self-serving motives; their outright lies for self-promotion; their violation of their own ideals of free speech; their lack of intellectual rigor applied to themselves; the list goes on and one. They are all very illiberal thinkers.But this guy doesn't make them. He sounds like a drunk at a bar rambling on with his diatribes.It's a shame, `cause this book needs to be written. But not by this guy."
5,excellent reference,After seeing a review of the book on bookTV and wanted to read the whole list. The book is a sort of reference of professors and what they actually do. It amazed me how intolerant universities have become to main stream values and how open they are to radical ideas and sometimes even fabricated truth. I would recommend this book to anyone who plans to attend a US university.
2,Aside from the politics,"Most people who are reviewing this book are taking a stance that either aligns themselves with radical conservatism or liberal leanings of the left. Aside from this aspect, I would like to point out that the book was laden with grammatical and formatting errors, as well as a decent amount of factual errors.While I agree that many of these professors could be and are harmful to academia, there is no way that Horowitz could possibly have any solid institutional knowledge on this many professors, and as such he has compiled these profiles with the help of his staff and has written several profiles based on hearsay and second-hand information.This shoddy attempt at an expose may give heed about some of these people (and in all honesty, I hope it does) but I think Dr. Horow...I'm sorry, Mr. Horowitz needs another edit or two before he mass markets his propaganda."
1,Wish he knew how to write,"My mom brought this book home and I just finished reading the intro and some of the profiles. I had to put it down, though, because the writing is so awful. I think much of this book was ghost written by one of the researchers who works for Horowitz. Just wish that guy knew how to write."
1,Dear Amazon...,"Dear Amazon,I wrote a review of this book, which you censored. I emailed you asking why, and got no response. So, I'm getting in touch via this review.As you can check from my purchasing history, between books and electronics, I've spent a good bit of money on your website. If you don't either re-instate my review or give me a good explanation, you're losing me permanently as a customer to bn.com et al.Yes, you, dear under-paid employee reading this, and otherwise utterly bored -- you will be responsible for the loss of a customer with an expected NPV to your company at least in the thousands of dollars.Have a nice day, regards, etc."
1,What about me?,"Oh man, I was so disappointed to flip through this book's index and not find my name. Every day I'm out there brainwashing my students with messages of peace, justice, and tolerance for cultural difference, but apparently all my hard work has gone completely unnoticed! So, Mr. Horowitz, I'd like to invite you to sit in on one of my classes in the sociology department at Florida Atlantic University. Maybe you'll even learn something! Afterwards, I live in Boca Raton so maybe we can cruise by Rush Limbaugh's pad and score some really killer drugs!"
1,Where do they come up with this stuff?,I'm a college student. I've been in school for 5 years and have 1 degree. I am working on another that should take me through at least one more year. If you think there is some sort of weird political agenda that college professors have you need to remove your head from the sand. It is amazing that there are two reviews(positive) that admit this book was based on hearsay and that another person will still continue to pay for it. This is so blatenly not based on facts and is instead just a description of fear of the worst. It does not even give you a glimps of what college is really like. email me at rabruzzese@hotmail.com if you don't think so.
1,I'm Confused,"Hmm. Seems as if this ""nasty, vicious little Republican hate tome"" has quite a few readers spun up. But I'm confused - if this book is indeed ""immoral, lying trash"", then doesn't that imply that those who would describe it as such agree that academic activism would be a dangerous influence, just that they don't believe it exists? If, on the other hand, they're sympathetic to the proposition that ""being an activist is a necessary prerequisite"" for the professoriate (quoting from the book), then Horowitz is demonstrably not lying."
1,"Sloppy researcher, how can it be believed","I cannot give a point-by-point critique of the book, however a good peek into the composition of the book came when the author appeared on the radio show Air Talk. When a professor profiled in the book claimed his profile had innacuracies, Horowitz HIMSELF admitted the profile was written by someone whom he himself did not know. This is the author himself saying that the book he claims to have written contains elements he cannot vouch for because he did not write them and has no idea who did. This is sloppiness that calls any other fact in the book into question. Is a particular write up on a professor a fair perspective or revenge by someone who got a 'D'. We really can't tell if the author admits he did no real fact checking."
1,A new form of PC,"For years, conservatives railed against leftist professors for being politically correct. Now Horowitz tries a new tactic, intimidation of those who do not share his views. He offers little evidence, despite the extreme views of some of these professors, that these views dominate discussion on university campuses. Instead, he tries to generalize based on anecdotal evidence. Further, he has been busy trying to take his scree on the road, getting conservative legislators to conduct hearings, another form of intimidation of those who do not agree with his perspective. Luckily, some of those hearings have backfired, for example, when he has failed to prove some of the charges that he makes in his book. My biggest regret in buying the book is that it added a small amount in royalties to Horowitz's pockets."
1,Invalid by Personal Experience,"The basic premise of the book is invalided by personal experience. As a student of Professor Targ, the sole Purdue University teacher listed, I can assure you there was no recruitment, indoctrination or any of the other horrors associated with him. Further, there were profs at Purdue that made Targ sound like Rush Limbaugh in comparison. Give me a break Horowitz, do a little research, maybe sit in the classes these folk teach and learn what really happens?"
2,A worse crime than stupidity... it's so boring,"Man, you can always tell when a book is completely off the mark. Conservatives flood these pages with nonsensical five-star stupidity.Horowitz has nailed them (again) in this book, though we all know what we mean by ""nailed"", don't we? As an professor myself, I have seen some of what David exposes, and I only wish I was enjoying the same kind of life he's living.It just makes my blood become completely lethargic, coagulating in utter boredom, to read about how these unpatriotic anti-Americans area not collecting enough tax dollars.Horowitzs' writing style leaves something to be desired but, again, we're talking about desire, so you all know what I mean. He sometimes comes across as angry which is usually the methodology of the left, but he leave me breathless and wanting more, and more.Overall, a very poorly written book. Very uninformative and misleading.[...]"
1,Oh no!!!,Look out! The big bad communist professors are out to get you and your children! Ahhhh!Horowitz's book couldn't be more of an absolutely asinine waste of paper. Not to mention all of the blatant inaccuracies.You'd need to be having a manic episode to believe half of Horowitz's vitriol.
2,Earns extra star for having good publicist,"I flipped through this book while at the bookstore. I recommend reading the writing of many of the people he pans and then judge for yourself whether he has a case.Especially focus on Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky.Both men LOVE to be challenged and seem to be genuinely moral men. If Horowitz' goal is to extinguish lights as bright as these men, then I have to believe that his goal is to bring us to darkness. From Seinfeld: ""You are a bad man Horowitz. A very bad man"". and from me: ""thanks for the lesson in propoganda.. too bad good people won't stoop so low"".And for those who criticize the ""left activist academia"": There are egos everywhere in academia... keep to the merits of Horowitz' book. Most of the people he criticizes are not the crazies that you had in freshman history."
2,Depends what you want to compile,"While I enjoyed reading the book, I am not fully agree with the basic idea. The similar book can be compiled for every side, for example 101 most dangerous professors in Pakistan who are pro-american, or 101 dangerous professors who are against homosexuality. It depends on how you define ""Dangerous"" and for which country? Furthermore, academics should be free from Categorization."
1,Who taught Horowitz to write?,David Horowitz's law professors should be very proud! This man attacks the very profession that educated him in matters of free speech. The same educators he attacks would defend his right to produce such a hateful book. I doubt Mr. Horowitz defends anyone's right to free speech but his own.
1,Horowitz is afraid of intellectuals.,"Horowitz is apparently scared witless that academics might actually have a political opinion. -And with good reason; the nation's intelligentsia tend to lean left. Horowitz would rather that professors be stupid, have no opinions, and would have them not educate their students, such that the nation's universities could churn out legions of uneducated but credentialed pigeons, ripe for the rhetoric of the right.Horrowitz is horrified that educated people disagree with him, and that the tenure system actually protects qualified academics from removal by the uneducated proletariat masses.It's easy to dig up dirt on people. Is it fair for Horowitz to dig up a paper someone wrote decades ago and use it as evidence against a person today? Does Horowitz have no skeletons in his closet?The bottom line is that this book is just more right-wing political spew. The right hates the educated, and is running scared."
1,This book is dull,"Very unimaginative. For all of those reviewers who are assuming that anyone with anything negative to say has not read the book, I read it. It read pretty much like a Nora Roberts novel and about as educational. For all of those who are soooo impressed that Horowitz uses endnotes and footnotes, HELLO, that doesn't mean a thing! Just because something is contained in an endnote does not make it God's truth. If that is the case, all I need to do is write half my thesis in superscript and everyone will think I am a genius. I'm just disappointed that no one I worked with personally is listed. My entire goal in life is to be in a book just like this. You really know that you're changing the world when people call you dangerous. See: Jesus in New Testament.You think liberals at universities is scary, you should see the type of person leading the average American church. That's really scary."
1,Why am I not on the list?,"As author of A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR (The New Press People's History Series; Howard Zinn, general editor), I'm most disappointed to have been left off Mr. Horowitz's list. One might think I'd at least have deserved honorable mention. I trust that Mr. Horowitz will be made aware of this oversight and that it will be corrected it in his next edition.David Williams, Ph.D.Professor of HistoryValdosta State University"
1,Sad,"So much for freedom of speech in America. If a few professors speak out against the extremist regime, they get ostracized. However, if they speak out against ""rogue nations"" or other terrorist regimes just as extremist as they tend to be, they are promised virgins in heaven. Hard work and 8 years in college gets you a place in this cretin's book. If he can say this, they can say what they have."
1,Dangerous book,Using questionable secondary sources instead of original works. the author has inserted his own bias into this book.
1,Just another bitter and miserable offering from Horowitz.,"More tedious claptrap from a miserable man with an axe to grind. These people aren't going to stop until we put jesus and a fetus on the one dollar bill. Don't buy this book, unless you know one professor in question, if so. Have them sing it for you. Have a laugh at the expense of bitter ole horowitz"
1,Cash Grab,"Academia has a long history of being a bastion for liberal thought, but Horowitz's mistaken premise is that this is a) somehow a conspiracy and b) anything new.His facts are weak and the book feels like it's just taking shots at low hanging fruit for a quick buck."
1,Dangerous authors...,"This book could serve as archtypical example of how rhetoric and slanted ""journalism"" (propoganda) can be used to distort the truth. I am glad that I picked up Horowitz's book because it made me aware of how dangerous he, and the machine that supports as well as promotes his agenda, are to basic democratic principles such as free speech. By distorting the truth and then using television and print outlets to create an interlocking framework of specious facts and arguments, Horowitz actually is damaging the very liberties that he supposedly stands for.Borrow this book from your library, don't buy it so that Horowitz profits more from your purchase."
1,has the world gone mad?,"The only thing more pathetic than this poorly-argued, erroneous book written by a sad, bitter old man is the possibility that there are some readers out there who may be taken in by his arguments. If higher ed has failed it is not because of the professors who Horowitz wants to put on trial as nothing less than conniving, contemporary witches - it has failed because there are not enough of such dedicated left-leaning professors around or scholarships, to educate the citizens of the US. Horowitz preys on the uneducated and uninformed, giving them a scapegoat for their social frustration and fears."
4,Thought provoking but scary at the same time,"I gave this four stars instead of five because a few of the professors mentioned in here seem to be just loose cannons for Communism rather than ruthlessly dangerous.How can these people teach a bunch of crap such as ""critical race theory"" in a course labeled ""English 101?"" What does ""queer theory"" have to do with learning torts in law school?And to think that people are trusting these individuals to educate the next generations of America. I'm thankful that none of these wackos ever taught me (though one of my former professors is a ""disciple"" of Eric Foner; ironically, he respected my conservative beliefs and encouraged his class to disagree with him if they felt so inclined).These people are a danger to true academia."
5,Essential for parents of and new undergraduate.,"This tome is overdue but necessary for parents of and all new undergraduates. It would also be most worthy for all prospective/potential donors to understand the current sad state of university ""education"". Last but by far not least, university/college administrators and all charged with the all too little supervision of the state of post secondary ""teaching"" in this country."
1,WoW,"Wow, this book was such a waste of money. The man goes on a diatribe that really does not logically fit. Maybe he should go back to school and get an education.A waste of both time and money. Propaganda at its greatest."
3,Deserves 4 stars,"Horowitz does something very interesting, he reveals the professors for who they are in their very own words. You cannot critisize him for presenting people as they are.You can judge if what these professors preach is indoctronation or educations but, having read the professors, yeah, it's pretty much a personal worldview imposed on students by unqualified ""academics"" (e.g. marxism a literary class rather than an economics or political science class??).I dropped a star not because he does not make his point well, he does, but it is a point made early and then repeated with many examples.The problem lies not in Horowitz but in the many, many, examples available. To catalog them all becomes quite an effort.But, the sheer volume of it all certainly makes the point as well.5 stars for making the point well.4 stars for form (sometimes horowitz becomes ""preachy"").3 stars because... well, I wish it could have been shorter but academia intrudes by providing waaaaayyy too many examples."
1,"Buy it, then burn it","Horowitz has been confused for so long that he can't remember when he began hating America. In 'The Professors' he makes claims that is false to all our campus experiences. When read juxtaposed to Howard Dean's ""You Have the Power: How to Take Back Our Country and Restore Democracy in America,"" you begin to see who's right, and how wrong Horowitz really is."
2,Strangely Droll,"A former coworker gave this book to me when she was finished with it because she was curious as to my response. I found it to be almost a parody of itself. As a person who has had to challenge lowered grades openly given for taking a moderate leftist position on papers when I was in college, I find it amazing that people will actually take these positions, especially considering the fact that the people who run both the public and private universities in the U.S. are almost exclusively conservative. Sure, there are liberal and leftist professors, and sometimes they do show a heavy bias in the classroom, but there are also quite a number of professors of a conservative ilk who, from my experience, are almost guranteed to show a heavy bias in their classrooms. That being as such, though, I still must give Mr. Horowitz credit for the quality of his writing. Hence the 2nd star."
1,Extremely Hilarious,"This book is so bad it's hilarious. This person offers the most one-sided, close-minded explanation for why these professors are dangerous. But it's so ridiculous, it's basically a comedy book."
3,Don't Underestimate College Students!,"Any college student intent on getting an ""education"", however one defines that, can usually get it at even a moderately prestigious university or college. There is, at many schools, an extensive network of commentary on individual courses, individual professors, and how to use the ""system"" to maximum advantage, whatever the goals. I suspect that most students will not buy this book, because they have no-cost sources of better information. I suspect it has always been thus at ""institutions of higher learning and lower living""--and quality is not well correlated with NCAA division or division record. A more interesting study would be of the underground sources of information, and how students use them. At one of the institutions I attended, the underground legal guide to renting apartments was priceless!"
1,Wow.,"I must say, I'm proud: one of my former professors made the list!I took a course with him titled 'Global Politics of HIV/AIDS.' It's funny, because he wasn't controversial at all. It was a geography course that looked at the issue sociologically (in terms of gender, race, class, etc. and how these things facilitated the spread of the HIV/AIDS infection -- this definitely isn't a super controversial topic, lauded writers and doctors such as Paul Farmer write on similar topics).Maybe this is crazy, but I'm pretty proud. It means he succeeded in taking people out of their comfort zones, making people think in a new way -- which is what the university is about. He didn't tout communism or anti-war stuff, in general -- the class was specifically conducted to create a dialogue with the students, he wasn't inserting his opinions much if at all! He was a great professor. I'm proud he made this list, because this David Horowitz has a screw loose."
4,excellent deal,"This is a great way of seeing some really great comedies of the classic era, such as our man godfrey, or even the smallest show on earth, as well as many other absolute jewels for a very affordable price.Sure there are no extras, the copies are not always the best, but for this price and this amount of movies one cant aspire to too much.I reccommend it highly."
3,Comedy Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection,"Received the movie collection within a reasonable time and the product is usable. However, the product, which comes in 1 1/2- 2 inch thick box in cardboard, was sent in a cushioned envelope rather than a box, so that the box was crushed upon arrival. Since the product is usable, I did not return the product. However, I would warn potential buyers to check with the supplier if the product will be shipped in a box or an envelope, since part of the enjoyment from the purchase is a package that is still in good condition (Who wants to purchase DVD boxes for 25 DVDs at the Dollar store?). As for the films in the collection, I have purchased several collections of films put together by Mill Creek Entertainment and enjoy watching these mostly older movies and TV programs. The video and audio reproductions are sometimes low quality (e.g. scratchy audio), but these movies and programs are still a delight to watch."
2,don`t know yet,"I am taking this product for three weeks already, I do not feel any different of my vision until today yet."
4,This was a good western!,"I love westerns and I am very picky about them. I had to write this review because the one's that were written were wrong.Watch this movie, very well done. If you enjoy cowboy flicks you won't be disappointed.I wouldn't want to miss this because of what someone else said. Now have fun partner and get ready for a good shoot em up movie!"
2,Slow moving with heavyhand acting,This is a grade B film that moves at turtle pace with heavy-handed acting. The plot line sounds good but it is carried out weakly. Jesse James has been shot and is laid up. His brother Frank refuses to split the heist of a robbery until Jesse is well. The three members of their gang want their share and want both brothers dead so that they would no longer be chased by marshals. A woman tries to talk Jesse into giving up his criminal carrier. A marshal tries to arrest Jesse. Frank buys a woman from a man who is mistreating her.
1,Junk,"Bad acting, poor direction, terrible sets and a very homogenized view of the old west. It's nice to see Fonda but he's not in it nearly enough to save the amateurish production. All the costumes look like they just came from the cleaners."
1,Worst Western Ever?,"Just watched this movie on TV and googled it to see if it had won any awards as the worst western ever made. Apparently not, but should qualify. I mean, I LOVE westerns, and this abomination was an insult to the genre, which admittedly has pretty low standards. The script was terrible! The acting was ridiculously bad. The plot was idiotic. If I was to cite its better points, I guess I'd have to say the editing, cinematography and music and would qualify for at least two stars, but the rest of it was so far less than one star that the final rating has to be one star. The other reviewers who gave it more than one star, I'm guessing they must be little kids or something. Or maybe they know the producers and owe them some kind of favor. Anyway, if you like westerns, don't watch this one."
2,"Sort of okay, I guess","Not a bad movie, but the actors seemed like community colege drama majors doing a project. Not worth renting, but if you can see it for free, go for it."
1,Major Disappointment.,"Whole thing about this movie simply throws mud into the fame, honor, and legendary of the Frank and Jesse James saga. I am deeply unhappy and disappointed."
4,Excellent Study Guide,"This study guide is great for the fundamentals in engineering exams. Good review guide, helped me ace the test."
5,Mengelberg+Furtwangler+Oskar Fried = This,"Basically what you have here is the best of Mengelberg, Furtwangler, and Oskar Fried all rolled into one-- from of all people, George Szell. I would have never guess it in a million years, but it's true. Trust me, this is anything but dull."
3,Mark Zonder made me buy it...?,"I have beena big fan of Mark Zonder from his Fates Warning recordings so I bought this one based on Mark's participation. I've yet to make it all the way through in one sitting, it's just not my style. This sounds more like the ""angry-white-boy music"" I hear on the new rock stations with lots of growling vocals and heavily distorted guitars.Mark's playing is still excellent and innovative but I can't get past the rest of the noise going on around him to enjoy it. The mastering must have been done on speakers with woofers becuase the bottom end on this disc is pretty heavy bordering on muddy."
3,Not what I expected,"Having been a fan of Fates Warning for a long time, and knowing that this band is the brainchild of Mark Zonder (drummer for Fates Warning), I was expecting some interesting progressive rock/metal. With this disc you get neither. While Zonder's drumming is excellent throughout, the compositions aren't interesting enough, nor the vocals strong enough, to warrant high praise.I am surprised that Inside Out signed these guys. It's good angry rock but IMO there is very little progressive music here. Zonder plays in the progressive technical style for which he is known, but the compositions are too generic for him to carry.This CD does not keep my interest sufficiently to play it all the through.Kevin"
2,Boring,"Kevin Delgadillo gets it. This CD is boring. I love Mark Zonder. I'm not familiar with the other guys. The guitarist is good, the vocals are average and the drumming is great. But like Joe Satriani, great musician, crappy songwriter. I also think the guitar sound is your 'generic-cheesy-hear how progressive we are' sound--or simply whimpy. Mark shoulda stuck with Jim Matheos and FW. It's also ironic that the record label is called Inside Out 'cause that is by far the worst FW album out there..."
5,Best Peeler Ever,I have used this peeler for about 10 years. It will even peel squash. I would be lost without it. I now need another for my daughter who lost hers.
2,Different color then what was shown,Quick shipping. The necklace came with the meaning and was just like what I buy in Hawaii. The only problem is when I received it it was a different blue then what I ordered. More of a teal. I might have returned it to try to get the right color but it was a gift.
2,I dont know man...,"Im not one of the original fans of this series, but I liked the first book.This second one is not near as good."
5,Something with meaning.,"I highly recommend this album, not only is the music excellent to listen to, but it has meaning. Its a beacon in an ocean of mindless hip hop."
1,Spend your money else where,"Seven Star is amazing. His idea to mix up one beat and use it over again for another song is brillant! So, if you like the beats of one song you will surely love the next! I regretted the money and time I spent on this album. You can trust me on that or, check it out for yourself."
3,"Excellent music, mediocre sound quality","If you're new to Benny Goodman, I would recommend a boxed set or double CD in order to get the full flavor of his music. This disc is skimming the surface of his great catalogue and the sound quality is average, at best. The remastering of these songs is sub par, especially on the vocal tracks like ""Why Don'tcha Do Right?"" The live songs from the Carnegie Hall '38 concert are similarly flawed and sound better on other CD's. It's hard to hear Krupa's magnificent percussion and if you aren't hearing Gene, you aren't experiencing the magic of the man or the band.A Benny neophyte would be well served by this standard ""Greatest Hits"" package but again, I caution you on the sound quality."
3,Does not Fit All Chevy Trucks,"Make sure when you order this, it is for an Avalanche or another truck with the same specs or the hangers will not match up, and if you try to make it fit, it will rub against your spare tire. If you want one that will fit a larger truck check out the model number 5003."
4,Everything was good except the hose,"So you are thinking about this kit. It's awesome, buy it. I've worked in Hawaii, Colorado, and with framers from California. For every, paslode, senco, bostitch, portercable, harbor freight model on the job there are twice as many hitachis running at the same time.If you are looking for a deal, um.....I don't know maybe this is it. If you are looking for tools that will keep up all day long, this kit will and more except the hose- lose it quick. I'm buying the polyurethane 1/4"" x 100' it's all over here in Aurora, CO and I've worked with it in the middle of winter- it's a must have.Good gun and compressor."
4,best air investment,"ok so i am a high end custom carpenter that does mostly framing, and i have to say from the 3 million dollar projects to the project in the back yard hitachi compressors and nailers are but far the best. The dual tank compressor can keep up with two skilled carpenters doing sheer wall nailing with very little lag and this is the only compressor of its size that even comes close to that. i have never been happier with a air purchase than i have been with this. My only advise is as far as the nail gun goes buy the NR83A2 not the NR83A the A2 has the adjustable nailing depth and if your in the trades is a huge help."
4,Good but could be great,"I have used this set to build a 24 X 28 garage with attic trusses in an earthquake zone (lots of nails). It fired thousands of nails mostly 8s & 10s with no problems, both single and bump. My only grump is that the nailer is has no depth control. It would have been dramaticlly better if it had been the A2 gun. The compressor often has to be reset a time or two when first starting in the morning, especially if you had drained it like you are supposed to. Those small gripes out of the way, this combo kit has served me very well. If you don't mind changing pressure every time you change nails it will give you long and reliable service."
2,PC SLOW with replacement part,"I received my PC 694VK almost 2 months ago and have used it very little because I am waiting for a replacement 1/4 inch collet from PC. The router comes with 2 collets and I was extremely disappointed when I inserted a 1/4 inch router bit and could not tighten it. The bit would fall out even after I tighten the collet to the point I almost didn't get it loosen up. The couple times I have used it with 1/2 inch router bits the router performs flawlessly. I am disappointed in the placement of the off/on swith, very awkward to reach. My latest call to PC customer service was met with ""the 1/4 inch collet is still on backorder""."
1,Bad motor,"I bought this router about 5 years ago, and it has only received light use. It's long out of warranty and now the motor won't start. It won't go from soft start to fully running. Another thing I noticed yesterday when I put a brass router bushing on it was that the plunge base was poorly centered and could not be corrected."
4,Porter Cable,"I bought this for my husband he was a little disappointed expecting the router to be larger this one is a bit smaller than the types he is accustomed to using, but when he started using he was quite surprised at the power and capability of this unit so therefore all in all I would highly recommend this item well worth the money."
5,Industry standard - AND EXCELLENT BUY,If you want a basic router with great fixed and plunge bases and both 1/4 and 1/2 collets then:JUST BUY IT!!!I have had mine for over several years and it just keeps on truckin'Ken
1,Brand New Out of the Box--Won't Start,"I'd love to tell you how good the router is, but it will not turn on. I can only infer that quality control is deficient, something that many others have discovered as well. Customer service is an 8 AM - 5 PM, Monday through Friday proposition, so no idea how to even get help. I'd recommend a different router and a different company."
3,Nice but not great,"I've been replacing my bargain Sears tools with those of better quality. Couldn't be happier with my other assortment of PC tools (nailers, saws, and drill). The router comb is definately nice, but not nearly as big of a step as I expected over a $59 Sears router. Depth adjustment is definately a big improvement, but took a step back by not having a locking collet (need both wrenches) for bit changes.Bought at a sales rep demo and got the dust collection base thrown in for free. It is better than nothing, but I wish I would have looked closer at the Dewalt set-up.Bottom line, does the job, but falls a little short of my high expectations for PC tools."
4,"Very Good Router, just dated","I have had my PC router plunge/fixed base router kit for about 5 years, and have used it quite a bit. The PC 690 series are very good routers that are very durable and have been around for many years. The PC 690 was the router by which all other routers of similar power were judged. If you buy a PC 690 series router, you will have a very good router - however, you may find yourself wishing that you bought a different, more modern router for about the same amount of money.As the years have passed, other routers have appeared on the market that are good routers with more modern features (above table bit changes / height adjustment, easier base changes, etc.) A few years ago, Porter Cable came out with a new and improved line of routers, the 890 series - that was obviously inspired by the 690 series.If I were looking for a new plunge/fixed base router kit today, I would buy the 890 series - the 690 series is still very good, just dated."
4,Good product but I think the same brand floor mat would be better.,Good product but I think the same brand in a floor mat would be better. After a while they get discolored from wear. And the rear one is difficult to remove to dump out water from snow melt(without spilling) because it is one piece. But over all still a good product they definately keep your carpets clean.
1,Missed the mark on this one,"I'm a diabetic born with a sweet tooth (like so many). Am always looking for the newest in sugar-free, reduced-sugar treats. This one let me down."
2,For Rex Competists Only,"A couple alternate takes and a lot of pretty grotty live tapes. The package doesn't really tell the buyer what to expect -- from a casual glance it appears to be a ""greatest hits"" compilation.That's probably exactly what the producers intended."
5,A wonderful introduction to T. Rex,"In case you overlooked T. Rex until you finally reacted to Cosmic Dancer playing for the opening credits of the movie Billy Elliot, you can be sure that the same era T. Rex is here in resplendant form, and the disc will be a great introduction to the band, and maybe all you'll ever need. Jeepster rolls along brilliantly, Cosmic Dancer is dreamy, and of course, Bang a Gong is here in the right context, and won't seem antagonistically good next to the usual selection you find it beside on the Best Of CD's. This is the one T. Rex CD that successfully steps outside its era, and is enjoyable to anyone who is not attracted necessarily to Glam Rock, but the idiosyncratic lyrics and delicious beats."
2,Save your money...,"I had confused this record with The Slider - otherwise I doubt I would have purchased it. Stuff recorded elsewhere, bad sound quality... Unless you are intent on owning everything ever recorded by T.Rex, don't waste your money."
2,Not Bad....Not Real Good Either!,This group used to be soooooo good. Now only the lead singer is in top vocal form; the other men might as well have not even shown up. They should maybe start thinking about retiring as well. I think the lead singer would do very well if he went solo!
3,Book is OK,"I am currently enrolled in a masters program in International Business majoring in Finance (University Maastricht, The Netherlands (www.unimaas.nl) . For a course on behavioral finance, I had to use this book as a reference. Though it is not quiet a hard core finance book, it is useful to learn about real life examples from the corporate field and to see the contradictions with overall acknowledged assumptions on investors behavior and real life results.The book is easy and fast to read and hold lots of examples. It is a perfect book for people interested in finance, but I doubt the academic use of it (no offense to both the author and my course coordinator)."
3,Not as pictured,"I ordered this item because my previously purchased one developed a crack in the display. Unfortunately, the delivered unit has a smaller display and smaller buttons that are arranged in a single row. I am not returning it, however I probably would not have made my second order had Amazon shown the correct picture."
2,works good for about a year.,"This is a good thermometer for about a year or 2. If you use it semi-frequently (approx 1x a week) expect after 1 year for the probe to come detached from the body. trying to fix it will either break the copper wires to the thermocouple, or short out the wires. good product for about a year."
3,Good and bad,"Pro:When it works, it works like it's supposed to (although a little slower).Good price.Con:Brand new, it's not unusual for them to be defective.If held over *any* heat or steam, the display freezes. Usually fixed by turning off then on, a problem if you're, say, tempering chocolate.I've been through 4 of these in the last 5 months. Used with care, they all broke or malfunctioned.What irks me most is my last one went wonky and displayed all L's. Neither replacing the battery or recalibrating helped. I emailed CDN (from their website) asking for help but never got a response."
4,So far so good,I have only used this a couple of times but the response time is fast and the temperature reading seems accurate
3,max function?,Has anyone been able to reset the Max setting? Holding the Max button down for several seconds does not reset it on mine.
5,Economically superb product!,"I've always been leary of 'instant' anything, but this instant-read cooking tool is wonderful! I no longer over- or -undercook meats, and I find it useful when determining the needed temperature of candies and such. I strongly recommend it!"
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"I bought this thermometer because of the price (Who can afford spending $100 on a thermometer?) It is great when it works, if it works. I changed the battery twice (not an easy task) to make sure that was not the problem. Sometimes the thing turns on, and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I find it ON in the drawer (I don't believe in ghosts...)Sometimes it shuts itself off in the middle of a reading. I don't use it anymore, it is going straight to the Salvation Army."
3,Not really instant read,I bought this as a replacement for a thermapen thermometer at 3 times the price. I don't think they are comparable. You can roast your fingers waiting for a final reading with this thermometer.
5,Love this castle play house!,"This is such a neat idea, to have a playhouse for little ones as well as their dolls all in one. We did not watch the Barbie movie, and my daughter is not aware that the castle is a replica from the one in the movie, she instead uses it for all of her dolls from Playmobil to baby dolls to barbies she already owned. We both love it and so far it has been a great escape for her as well as an outlet for role playing with dolls. I was initially in search of the right tent for her to use indoors, but settled on this one instead. Note it is bigger than the box suggests. The castle is 4 feet in diameter on the inside, much larger on the outside. Be sure you have the space for it! Once it is set up in a room you will want to leave it up for a while, and it won't fit through a doorway."
3,improvement needed,"The main problem with this castle is that the 4 shelves, which make up the ""2nd floor"" of the castle, do not fit well into the grooves. We tried glueing them but they still fall down. THis is a big disappointment since you can't put anything on these shelves or apply any pressure at all.Otherwise, assembly is easy. Worth $50.00, not $100.00.Other than the shelves, my daughter does love it."
2,I was disappointed.,"This is an obscure theological book. The central core of it is about 50 or so pages long (written 1000 years ago or so, and translated). It gives some of the doctrinal beliefs of a non-Catholic Christian faction that existed hundreds of years before Martin Luther. Personally I was hoping for more and varied detail about their beliefs, and so was disappointed by the contents. But I would say it is a must have for a library that contains an extensive history of Christianity over the centuries."
2,Indoor Outdoor Pre-lit Christms tree,"This tree is much skinnier and smaller than the photo made it look like. I'm very disapointed with this purchase. I will lose too much paying for the shipping both ways than just keeping it. I will use it this Christmas and make due. Also the blue garland I purchased is an ugly off blue color instead of a softer blue I was hoping for. The same rating on the blue ornaments I purchased. My tree this year will be interesting with how it will look. I hope I'm not terribly disapointed because I'm stuck with all of it. If I had the choice, I would not have purchased any of it."
4,Large is for large people,"The sweatshirt is oversized in every direction, including the neck opening. I knew the sizing ran large from other reviews, but didn't realize that if I still wanted it a little roomy, going from Medium to Large meant that I could hide several basketballs in the chest and a football in each sleeve. Be careful! The quality is excellent, and it is thick and soft."
4,Champion Sweatshirt,"What's not to like? Feels nice, fits nice, looks nice, sizes right ... I wear it all the time and will get several more, but with hoods ... highly recommended"
3,Not as comfortable as the pants,"There was some shrinkage after the first washing and this sweatshirt has not softened up much after a dozen washings. The pants, on the other hand have resisted shrinkage pretty well and are softer and more comfortable now that they have been broken in."
5,Really nice sweatshirt,"This is a very nice sweatshirt. The color is exactly what I wanted in a maroon and the length and fit at the waist is excellent. It is bulky in the sleeves and width wise for a medium, which I normally wear (I can also wear some large size items, depending on the cut). But, I would rather have it a little bulky than too tight. It may shrink a little when washed,being 90% cotton.Excellent purchase! And, the delivery was very prompt from the seller."
1,Thumbs Down,"bought 3 of these and Im guessing that the steel had not been hardened properly ?? For whatever reason they would not hold an edge (steel would curl at the cutting edge). They could be made sharp, they just would not hold the edge past 1 or 2 cuts (with the grain)."
2,Not very sturdy,"The posts for this item were rather unsturdy. Had a small part missing, the bolt for the tether to hang from. The tether tennis ball broke within 20 minutes of play."
2,ojo,la calidad no es buena y no he podido devolverlo porque me vale mas devolverlo que comprar otro porque estoy en colombia
5,Love it!,"Fast and fabulous is how I describe this cookbook. I cook alot..and have quite a collection of cookbooks...this is one of my favorites. This cookbook has great pictures of all the prepared recipes...which is a ""must have""."
2,not so fun to use,this stuff is a polymer dust that you are supposed to mix with medications and food.you then are supposed to add water and stir it up.you put the results in a tank and it quickly sinks and makes a mess.the seachem people said in the forums that what i just said is expected.i'm not so sure my fish are eating this slurry i am putting in the tank.i would rather use maracyn II and treat in a hospital tank
3,"Sally Kirkland, Kathy Bates, and Sarah Michelle Gellar!","Sally Kirkland followed up her Golden Globe Award Winning and Oscar Nominated Best Actress turn in ""Anna"", with this interesting indie film that co-stars Kathy Bates and a young Sarah Michelle Gellar as her daughter.Melanie Rose is a Hooker and Stripper with a heart of gold, trapped in a dangerous world of sex, drugs, mobsters, and abuse. As she tries to save her daughter, she finally meets a white collar man, who helps her escape, but not without a price.If you are a Sally Kirkland fan, you will enjoy this little seen film."
3,just what i was looking for!,I had looked and looked for just this type of pill box. good price and good quality! Thankseasy to fill is a PLUS
3,Good size medicine box,This is a good size medicine box for my mothers. She has to take so many tablets each time. Each compartment is big enough. I would suggest the producer to use different color of plastic for each day. This will help avoid mix-up.
3,Apex Medi Tray,"I purchased this also for my wife. However, the ""Easy Dose 4 A Day"" version has worked to her total satisfaction. So she gave this to her mother for her management of multiple medications on a daily basis."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,when i ordered this product i expected to get the blue containers -- like the ones i have been using for years. these did not have the days of the week on them. i liked that because i find it much easier to move around if i miss a dosage or whatever. this looks EXACTLY like the ones i have been using and really like. when i got them there were clear AND the days of the week were printed on them. clear was the last color i would have chosen. just very disappointing to order one thing and get another. one of the first times amazon has let me down.
2,Wont stay closed,Bought this product about a month ago to keep track of my 4 times a day meds. Liked that the product let me put all meds in 1 night a week without having to worry about it everyday. I take out a tray and put it in my purse. That's when the trouble begins. They do not stay snapped in place and I end up losing pills in my purse. Very disappointing.
3,HUGE,"I didn't check the sizing on this, but its the size of my ipad, not a bad thing, but not what I expected, and not easy for travel"
3,Not So Easy to Open,"Three problems with this medication tray: the tabs to open each compartment are TINY and require a good fingernail. I have mild arthritis in my hands and find them hard to operate; advanced arthritis would make this nearly impossible. While it is nice to be able to remove the pills for one day from the tray, the daily containers come out when you do not want them to and are too large to put in your pocket. The overall tray is large; takes up too much space on a bedside table. This is a great organizer for someone who takes a lot of pills and gets confused easily. I prefer the twice-a-day organizer, which is smaller, easier to open and allows me to select pills for the first or second half of a 24-hour period."
3,Lids do not stay shut after a few weeks use,I thought this was the greatest until the lids kept opening and I'd find my pills all over my purse. I finally had to quit using it for travel. )0:
3,Its just OK,"Its not see through, so you really never know whats inside unless you open it. Its a cheap price for a reason."
2,GREAT BOX - BAD COLOR! Buy the CLEAR ONE!,Have been using this box for a couple of years to dispense my mother in law's meds and it works great. The lettering on the old one was rubbing off - have rewritten with markers - just decided to get a new box - so she would have TWO weeks worth.THE BLUE COLOR IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. You cannot see inside the box to see if the meds have been taken without opening up each portion of the box. The clear box is great - this BLUE BOX is just not a good idea at all.The box itself is fine and works great for what we need - but anything but CLEAR PLASTIC is just a waste of good money. Will reorder the clear box - this one isn't worth shipping back.
4,Billy Daniels,"No one can sing ""That Old Black Magic"" like Billy Daniels. I'm so happy I was able to find this on Amazon."
2,That Old Black Magic - Billy Daniels,I was dappointed. I was expecting a CD and it was a DVD...My mistake. It is o.k. but I cerainly wouldn't have bought it if I had realized. . I'll only watch it once in a great while vs a CD that I would play often.
2,Cheapest material I've ever seen.,It's like this thing is made out of tissue paper. It got bumped and cracked. Then it bumped again and got a hole in it. Ridiculous.
2,"good production, but it was damaged","Just received the board few minutes ago, it was broken. Actually, I bought this board for my 3000 pieces puzzle because i couldn't find suitable puzzle frame. It's big enough,but damaged. It was broken from left side to the middle and can't work for my puzzle."
3,Nice set but....,"I received this set fast and it is a very nice set with solid handcrafted maple turnings and fittings.But, they could have put two pieces together that somewhat matched in color and grain. The Pepper Mill is a darker Maple with a beautiful grain, while the Maple in the Salt Shaker is a white Maple with less grain and texture. Setting on the counter together makes them look as though they came out of two different sets.Somewhere, someone else has the matching Maple Salt Shaker for my set, while I have theirs."
5,God is Closer than You Think,Excellent product. Very thought provoking!! Author is gives numerous insights concerning the closeness of God.
4,God Is Closer Than You Think,"""God Is Closer Than You Think"" is another good title by John Ortberg. This book focuses on the thought that we may meet God in our everyday circumstances, no matter where we are and what we do.Among the points covered include:1. God's great desire is to be with us everyday.2. God is involved in the everyday circumstances of our lives.3. When God is silent and appears to be distant.4. Like Brother Lawrence, learn to practice the presence of God in your everyday life.A good and encouraging read for the person who wants to know God more intimately. Good news - God wants you to know Him infinitely more than you want to know Him!Recommended."
5,God Is Closer Than You Think,I think the book was great. Easy to read & a lot of ideas to think about.
3,Don't try so hard!,"This is a very helpful little book on how to find God in your everyday life. The discussion of Martha & Mary is particularly astute. My only complaint about the book is that Ortberg tries way too hard to be funny and even hip. (This is the first book of his that I've read, so I don't know if he does this all the time or not; I suspect he does.) Humor should be natural, not forced, as it is in this book. His attempts to be hip are merely pathetic. For instance, he quotes the line ""The jerk store called & they've run out of you"" attributing it to a friend of his. He obviously has no clue it comes from a Seinfeld episode! Still & all, a good book, though, for a Christian at any level."
4,Excellent job.,"The book was delivered on time, and in great condition. I was very pleased overall with the purchase."
5,"Practical, Pragmatic, Prayful","In his typically gentle, humorous and graceful way, John Ortberg reminds us that we don't have to try very hard to be in God's presence. Through a series of stories and simple lessons, the pastor leads us on an easy path to continue to open ourselves to our Creator. Though the principles behind the book are deep and profound, the text itself is so accessible and inviting. This book was a great gift, which has continued to be a part of my daily devotion and deepened relationship with our Father."
4,$12.99 for maxgrip,strong tough and comfortablesometimes I try out all the tools I have for a problem such as breaking apart corroded plastic and steel and I feel very good about Stanley maxgrips.
2,Not For Experienced Sys Admins,"With its reprinted man page filler, screen shots of the ridiculous SAM GUI, and introduction to shell scripting, this book might be useful for the most junior of systems administrators. For those of us who already know what a subnet mask is, however, it leaves quite a lot to be desired.The author never really seems to go into great detail as to the 'why' of things. This might have something to do with the fact that the author has written very little original content for this book - again, it's almost all man pages and screen shots.This book receives two stars rather than just one, because it could conceivably be useful for someone who's never administered a Unix system before. Otherwise, I would recommend avoiding this book altogether."
1,Total lack of detail,"The book constains too little useful information both for newbie and for experienced administrator. The author is running through the different parts without in-depth explanation or practically useful information. The only reasonable part is Chapter 1 which covers HP-UX installation. I bought this book as preparation tool for HP-UX test but it won't work. Also, about 1/2 of the boot itself consists of hardcopy of man pages. Probably this is the most expensive you to print the man pages. Conclusion - don't waste money on this book, use the books from LDP, HP Instant Information CD or buy ""Unix System Administration Handbook"" by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Scott Seebass, Trent R. Hein - the best overview of UNIX and it's flavours I have ever seen."
5,A great book!,"An excellent book! The author jumps into HP-specific tools and tasks, quickly helping someone with basic unix skills be productive. Useful screenshots and illustrations. I liked the inclusion of man pages, allows reading on the train to work.Although probably a bit deep for ""windows-only"" administrators, this book let me translate my Linux/Solaris skills into an HP environment. It skips the explination of basic commands and gets right in to making the system work well."
1,Same book all over again,"I have a problem buying the same book over and over again. Marty re-uses the material from his earlier books without adding anything new or altering the material.And why should I pay for a book that is 20% man pages that are freely available to anyone who works on HP-UX.Tell Marty to stop writing the same book over and over again. Instead, he could concentrate on something far more interesting to his audience..like ServiceGuard and IT/Operations...stuff that people who work in the field would like to know more about. But then he'd have to actually spend time writing and researching...rather than reformating his old material.I'm sure there are many HP-UX horror stories out there...clients who don't know how to setup or administrate their million dollar systems....why dones't he write about that.....for a change."
2,Go to the NCEES Site for a better review,"Since they changed the format for the ChE PE Exam, this bookisn't completely worthless, but you would serve yourself better bygetting the sample test book from the NCEES.This book isn't bad forstudying and doing example problems, but take into account the testhas changed..."
3,Need to return for another,This product has been used for approximately a month and my husband is seeing some results. The problem is that it will not turn on and off properly and does not beep when it's time to change positions as it used to do. I will be contacting Amazon customer service.
5,Excellent book for collectors and non-collectors alike,"I procured an advance copy on ebay, and I loved it. I learned quite a bit about coin collecting, 20th century numismatics, King Farouk, and collectibles and the law. It was a very enjoyable read, and I highly recommend it, for both coin collectors and non-collectors."
1,What a Rip Off. Don't Buy this!,"I thought I was purchasing a book, instead I received 3 pages (1559 words) consisting of birth and death dates, a list of Fahs writings, and two paragraphs containing one line reviews of the same. To charge $9.98 for this is unconscionable. Don't let this happen to you!If I could have I would have rated it minus stars but that's not possible with the technology here.The Reverend Sarah Clark, Unitarian Univesalist minister, Plymouth, MA, First Parish."
4,A ONE AND ONLY SCENT,"A unique and eye catching perfume bottle - curved with a marron glace copper lace corset for a luxurious wrap.Top notes are rose made even more mysterious by a tad of rum and orchid. Base notes include mere hints of vanilla, sandalwood and sweet amber.A rare scent best for evening and special occasions."
5,Beautiful!,"Angel in the Waters will definatly convert you to being pro-life! This story is a beautiful tale of a baby developing in it's mother's womb, and talking to it's guardian angel while it's in there! You'll enjoy this beautifully illustrated book!!!"
5,A must for an expecting mother,"I bought this for my older daughter when I was expecting no.2. It's about an unborn baby speaking to the angel inside the womb. It is so lovely, it actually brings tears to my eyes while carrying my baby and reading it to my older daughter on my lap. It also helps my older daughter to appreciate what is happening inside my tummy and appreciate her baby sister more!"
3,Not bad.,"Regina Doman, <strong>Angel in the Waters</strong> (Sophia Institute Press, 2004)I'm slow on the uptake sometimes (and all too used to ""angel"" bring used in a generic sense), so when we picked this up at the ultrasound place (amazing what you can buy at an ultrasound place these days!), I wasn't fully aware of the book's overtly religious bent. If that's a problem for you, stop right here, this may not be the book for you. Despite my distaste for that angle of it, I thought it did a really good job at broaching a number of potentially discomfiting/embarrassing topics kids have a tendency to ask about long before parents are ready to address them (death, ""where do I come from?"", etc. If only the author had found a way to explain taxes to children...). Would love to see something like this from a non-religious perspective, but until we get something like that on this level of both storytelling and illustration, <em>Angel in the Waters</em> will do fine. ***"
5,AWESOME!!!,"I would buy this for all of my children. I absolutely LOVE this book. It is beautifully written. It is an awesome way to explain pregnancy to older children, and even inquisitive children. There are some religious undertones to it, though."
4,Torn between two lovers,quality not 100% but that is to be expected of such an old movie.Bloody hell this is a damn nuisance can't submit without having to write a book. Please change this format as it's tiresome. Does it really matter how many words one writes?
5,Sturdy map,"This is a map made to be used! It has a waterproof finish that you can mark up and then wipe off. It folds up easily, and it will take the abuse of long car rides with kids. I am very happy with this purchase - need one for every state!"
2,Gangsta Blac is one of the top rappers in the south.,"(Can it be) was a decent album, maybe he should've had his cousin Playa Fly on there. Anyways the beats were different from the previous prophet entertainment beats, but Gangsta Blac's lyrics made the album worth listening to. Him and Playa Fly should stay together, but get da f*ck away fro Super Siggs ya heard me."
1,scarecrows follower,"I believe that gangsta blac had it good at first, then his as$ messed his own self up by going against the best ( 3-6 )yeah boy, ya heard me! If playa fl would've kept his mouth shut and quit hatin on all of his cd's, then maybe they would get somwhere---well, maybe not but at least they wouldn't be diggin their grave like they are now."
3,Not half B.A.D.,"Can sum this one up real easy. The first 7 cuts are pretty good, the next 6 rather flat and boring. Definetely more mellow than previous efforts. If you really want some classic B.A.D. search for ""This Is Big Audio Dynamite"" or ""Megatop Phoenix""."
5,Awesome DVD!,As a die-hard Texas Blues fan this DVD was an awesome history lesson on one of the greatest promoters of the blues. Antone's is the home of Texas blues and watching this DVD provided an excellent history behind the making of legends. There are some really neat clips of some of the greatest blues artists never before seen.A must own/must see.
5,Good Music,My brother-in-law specifically requested this as his Christmas gift and I ordered it for him. He loved it.
5,"Great Man, Great Book!","I know the author personally, and he is the genuine article! His book is moving, touching and glorifies the Lord in every chapter. The words are heartfelt. It's exciting to see lives changed and Jesus honored. Do yourself a favor and get this book! You will be blessed!"
5,Great product,Product is well made and appears to be coated to prevent rust. It connected easily to the end of a chain with a shackle and worked great the first time I used it.
1,Can't recommend - support is horrendous,"I'll warn you now, the FaderPort does NOT work with Logic running in 64-bit mode. And the latest firmware won't install properly without an error message. I attempted to work with tech support, but they insisted on giving me instructions for Windows even though I told them twice I was on a Mac. I give up.This has been broken under Logic 64-bit for months, check the PreSonus forum, everyone is complaining about it. The company simply does not care."
1,SHAME ON YOU PRESONUS!!!!!,This product does not work with Logic 9.1.1 in 64 bit mode.Fix it PRESONUS!
4,Cute and informative,"This is not a how to book on pig-farming. It is informative about miscellaneous facts and has good breed information. Best of all, it is written in a light-hearted, entertaining manner."
4,Funny good info,this book dosn't help with raising pigs but general knowledge is good. has a lot of funny pig facts. all in all a good book.T
3,average read,"the book is simply ok...accurate industry lingo; very very similar style to stephen frey novels....however, ""merger"" has stretches where the plot gets flat and dull. overall, its enetertaining, but average..nothing special"
4,Prepare to be entertained!,"Couldn't be better-timed!!! Inspired no doubt by the chicanery of Enron and Worldcom, Merger is at heart a morality play between good and evil that delivers the message that ""greed is NOT good"". Shades of the movie Wall Street make this story an overdue addition to the current zeitgeist. Sure, corporate thrillers abound in the market, but this one really delivers! Sex, violence, corruption, ethical dilemmas, financial maneuverings, politics, corporate greed, it's all there. And it's all delivered as one larger-than-life tapestry of storytelling - much like those at the villain's Hamptons' home... Prepare to be entertained!"
3,Ok read,This was a thrill ride read. There were some parts that seems to be stretching a bit. I thought he was spot on with some of the characters and what goes on in the business world. With all the twists and turns in this book you never know what is going to happen.
4,Thriller,"MERGER is a well-plotted, entertaining thrill ride that also manages to be intelligent. In recent years, authors writing screenplays disguised as novels have soured the once hallowed genre of the corporate thriller. MERGER provides refreshing relief from this syndrome. Author Sanghoee's style is at times bombastic but he still manages to exploit the medium of the novel to take viewers behind the closed doors of Wall Street and Corporate America through meticulously crafted detail. There is substance to the tale, not just style. Corrupt CEO, Vikram Suri, is one of the most engaging villains in recent memory, ranking right up there with Michael Douglas' masterful Gordon Gekko. Through an intricate web of untraceable money laundering transactions and illicit dealmaking, Suri organizes an embezzlement scheme that makes WorldCom look like a big misunderstanding. Highly recommended reading for anyone who likes THRILLERS!"
2,"Mediocre, at best. Dissapointing.","Anyone who knows even a bit about the industry will find this dull. The plot is terribly transparent. The characters are either highly contrived or wholly forgettable. There's no suspense to it. Highly formulaic. Very, very dissapointed."
1,Boring - couldn't watch it,"The two-dimensional uninteresting characters put me to sleep after I gave it a try. I skimmed through it, and promptly erased it - it was on Turner Classic Movies. Glad I didn't buy it. I do like movies from the 40s, otherwise."
5,Great Book! Good book on ADO.NET,"I'm a ASP.NET database developer and this book is filled will many of the examples that I need.If you read or run the code on the CD while your read the book, you will learn at a very fast rate.Way to go Dino. Thanks for all the help."
4,Perfect of Experienced ASP.NET Developers,"Looking for database development using Web? Have good experience with ADO.NET? Know basics of XML and ASP.NET? Want to write data-driven Web applications??If any of the above is true, this book is for you. You may be disappointed if you're a beginner of ADO.NET and ASP.NET. If you read MSDN magazine, you may find lot of stuff familiar.Overall a good one to own."
1,Don't buy it!,"It provids some codes which you can borrow from internet as well, that's it.Not a good book to keep."
3,Terse and lacking description,"As previously stated with the other reviews, the guide presents some interesting aspects of data presentation and manipulation with .NET. The text greatly lacks in the area of explanation leaving the reader to make conclusions for themselves; Thus, flying in the face of the purported purpose of a technical treatise on ASP.NET and/or ADO.NET. This did serve as a good companion to the other ASP.net books in my possession. Donny Mack's Programming Data-Driven Web Applications and Jesse Liberty's well known ASP guide for overall coverage."
1,Don't buy this book before you read it,"Usually M$ make good software and good books, but not this book.First of all, it should not be named as ""Building Web Solutionwith ASP.NET and ADO.NET"", instead maybe it should namedas ""Data Control or Controls in ADO.NET and Web application"",or just ""a few advance topics in ADO.NET and Web application"".The price of this book is $...but I think it only cover aFew special topics of ASP.NET and ADO.NET.Anyway, it not a comprehensive of ASP.NET and ADO.NET as thebook name indicate.Bottom line, It should publish like a white paper not a book."
4,"Excellent Book, Great Examples","This is a great book if you're already familiar with ASP.NET and ADO.NET. It does an excellent job of covering details of various controls, in particular the datagrid.Dino provides many great lessons on how the datagrid works. I gained valuable insight into the capabilities of this amazingly flexible control through this book.Its clear that Dino has spent a significant amount of time learning the ins and outs of ASP.NET/ADO.NET, you will benefit from his insights.My only complaint about the book is that the code snippets in the text are often left incomplete. You have to refer to the code on the companion CD to get the whole picture. But that's a minor point.I'd recommend this book to anyone planning on coding with ASP.NET/ADO.NET."
2,NOT an ADO .NET resource,"I bought this book assuming that it would be the best of both worlds; a basic guide to the new ADO.NET objects as well as a starting reference to ASP.NET. By the time I got to read this book I found that I had already learned much of what it had to offer on ASP through trial and error and there was almost nothing to even explain what ADO.NET was. I just learned more about ADO.NET from 6 sample pages on ... for the ADO.NET core reference than this entire book. Not necessarily a bad book, but the title is very misleading. The ebook was a bit dissapointing also."
2,Bad door zipper,The zipper slides completely off when it is unzipped. If you have the flap open make sure you have a special storage place for the zipper so you dont lose it. This could have been prevented by sewing it correctly.
5,A Comprehensive guide for students and teachers,"I am a yoga practitioner and teacher. I have found this book to be extremely beneficial to my personal practice and my teaching.I teach to many different levels of students often within the same class. By exploring the underlying patterns within the asanas that Farhi discusses, each student learns to modify or deepen their practice according to their own needs. I am able to accomodate a diversified class, and to help fascilitate a richer and more genuine connection to the body."
5,I love this book!,"As a student and teacher of this ancient practice, I found this book invaluable. The beautiful photos and readable text make a lovely and educational partnership. As it did for me, this book can become a reliable resource of inspiration and instruction. I highly recomend it!!!!---Ned Christensen--Midway, Utah"
4,Yoga,Wonderful book. Donna Fahri explains yoga in its entirety. She doesn't just focus on the postures. She addresses breathing and the benefits to the body's entire physiological systems.
5,This gal really knows her yoga.,"This well written book talks about the alignment principles of yoga from the inside out. Then Ms. Fahri takes that information and applys it to the poses, explaining what should be happening in the body to maximize the benefit of the pose from a whole body perspective. Once you have read it you will never think of yoga the same again. I highly recommend this book for teachers and serious students. One of the best I've ever read!!!"
5,a must have book for all yoga practitioner,"i am highly recommend this book, alltough this book got no those kind of unbelievable posture but the book explained the very core of the principle of all yoga, very easy to understand, when you have this book actually you are already understand all of other yoga practice."
2,"Great book, but...","Great book on yoga, especially the beginning section which offers a detailed description of the many elements of yoga. But...why so many pictures of poses with the yogi naked? Makes it not so great for family use. I wanted to share this with my kids, but clearly that won't happen. Full front nudity, of all kinds. These are drawings, not photographs, but nothing is left to the imagination. Let the buyer beware."
1,required reading for my teacher training,"I found this book to be very annoying because you can barely get through one paragraph without her describing something that one must get up and try in order to properly visualize. Unless you have a friend reading the book aloud to you (which I did not have) it is difficult to get into position at the same time you are reading the book.This book was required reading for my yoga teacher training. At one point I used Ms Farhi's own words in class: my fellow trainee attempted to follow the instructions I was reading aloud. It was discovered that they didn't even work! No one would get into a shoulder stand in the real world the way the book instructs. Well, I guess you could follow the pictures. I can't recommend this book.I think the title is kind of silly too. I saw no justification for calling it a ""return to wholeness"" Return from where?"
1,Accuracy vs. Color,"Hopefully you are reading reviews to make your decission on a meter and not being influenced by the choice of colors as I was. I have a, green. red. and silver mini, I have used for quite a while now. At times I would get an obviously wrong reading from one of the meters, and would have to retry again before I ""believed"" my reading was correct. Recently, I decided to test all three meter's glucose results against each other,(why didn't I try this before? I don't know == Dumby!!!!) Not only did they result in readings that were not close to one and other on the same blood drop, they were not even close on the same mete when a second or third test was done. Some tests were differing from 300 to 150. B-B-W"
5,I Love This Meter,"Being diabetic for 32 years I have had my experiences with glucose meters. This little unit is very accurate and very portable. The case which holds the meter, test strips, lancet device plus it can hold a bottle of insulin, several shots and alcohol pads is 6"" X 3"". It fits easily in a pocket or purse. I hate carrying around a big case with me, so this meter set is perfect for me and my active lifestyle. I ordered three of them, one for home, one for work and one to keep in my purse. I always have a meter with me. They also come in different colors which is also a fun twist. This meter is worth the 20 bucks!"
1,One touch ultra mini - huge discrepancy!,"This meter seemed ok for a long time, then one day it gave readings of 300+. My other two meters gave readings in the 80s. This is unacceptable and could have caused a serious insulin overdose. I will discard this meter immediately."
2,keep getting error,I HAVE BEEN USING THE ULTRA-MINI FOR ABOUT 1 MONTH AND I HAVE SO MUCH TROULBE WITH ERRORS...SINCE THE TEST STRIPS ARE QUITE EXPENSIVE I HATE TO KEEP DOING IT OVER AND OVER...WONDERING IF ANYONEELSE HAS TROUBLE WITH GETTING ERRORS ALL THE TIME...
2,Not Accurate,"This meter gives inaccurate readings that I take from the SAME blood sample, for example, 162, then 137, then 143??? Maybe the strips are defective? I'm forced to use 2-3 strips per test. I called the mfg, they gave me no help.I am taking both Insulin and Metformin, and I am going crazy trying to make sense of it."
1,Not very accurate,"I just bought this about a week ago from the local CVS. based on the reviews here I decided to test its accuracy. I took the first est and it came i at 108 and immediately, i tested a second time an it came in at 116. this is from the same piercing. i will be looking for another monitor and keep this as a spare."
1,Over 2 year expired!!,The expiration date of this product shows 6/2009 which is over 2 years expired. How can we trust this test equipment for testing glucose?
1,Don't waste your time.,Going back to accucheck compact plus after a week of trying to live with this inferior meter. I even bought another as a comparison. My life depends on these meters. After a call to one touch their solution was a 6 months supply of control solution. These meters should be recalled.
3,not quite sure how to properly use it,i never got a good and reliable reading out of this instrument. may be i am missing something or the instrument may not be working properly not sure about it.
1,Very expensive because MANY WASTED TEST STRIPS,"My insurer forced me to change from FreeStyle, which is non-preferred and so would cost more. I bought the One Touch Ultra Mini based on reviews from diabetes sites (my other insurance choice was the AccuCheck). PRO: The OneTouch (what a joke that name is) is small and tests fast. CON: The big problem is that it requires lots and lots of blood. It is not unusual for me to have to use three strips. This completely wipes out the cost advantage. I have tried for months to use it but my hands are like pincushions. I recently had minor surgery and in the hospital they asked me about all the pinholes on my hands. I have tried several lancing devices but the result is the same: not enough blood and you get ""Er5."" It's so bad that I have black-and-blue splotches full of pinholes because I've run out of places to test. NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,A well made tool with a Super Strong Grip!!!,"I have had these Pliers' for appox. 4 weeks and if you can get the face for them onto a nut, bolt, screw, ect... You'll be able to turn/remove it with no to very little slip. The cushioned grip is extremely comfortable for short or long term usage and also allows the user to gain more torch on the object in which you are working with. I have also complimented this tool with the needle nose version which is very similar in operation and functionality!!! A Definite 5 Star in my Book!!! I'd recommend them to anyone that could benefit for a little extra torch with a lot less effort!!!dlhatton"
4,$6.99 great price for max grip,I recommend Stanley's max grip line for comfort and non stressful dropping of the tool.
1,Buy a different holster!,"As MerchantMariner mentioned, this holster just does not stay closed! The velcro strips seem to be mismatched, and do not operate properly together. The flap will not stay closed with the flashlight in it, or even with the flashlight out of it.Move on to another holster option, even it it costs more than this one. I find it hard to beleive that Streamlight would let this product go to market."
1,Piece of crap,"I attempted to use this for duty carry for a streamlight strion. It is a piece of junk I did not even put this on the belt. I ripped the belt loop just by tugging on it. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THIS FOR DUTY CARRY, LOOK ELSEWHERE."
4,step by step branding,"I bought this book as an inspiration for writing my paper on ""branding"" at Design University in Kolding, Denmark. It gave me a good insight on what branding is, how it happens, and how it can be applied.Along with this book, I also read ""the Brand Gap"". Those two would more or less be a complete info on what branding is all about ( though i read a bunch of books before, I could have done just with those two...)Designing Brand Identity first explains all the steps to take in order to develop a brand, then actually shows many different ways of doing it in case studies.If you want to know, how to design a brand, this is a great book to start with, and definitely something every ""branding"" compnay should have in their shelves. It's definitely worth its price and a wonderful resource. Do buy it. I did, and love it."
5,An Indispensable Resouce,"An indispensable resource for designers and their clients, Designing Brand Identity is a guidebook, sourcebook, and a fascinating history of brands and their creation. This reference reveals the secrets and the inspiration that have guided the best and the brightest in designing, marketing, positioning, naming, and branding products and services."
4,Great advise for potential clients,This gives a very good overview of the basic process of graphic branding. Good primer if you're in the market for some design work for your new product or you think you may need an overhaul on an old product / service.
2,Its more on technical aspect of branding,"The book, has only 3 or 4 colored pages i think, and everything else are in black or grayscale, the price is quite expensive for its content, the paper they used in printing the black or grayscale part of the book is kinda like the regular bondpaper, not really like the regular paper being used in graphic books. The content are very technical, i think this book, seems like its for the marketing part of a company rather than the creative department."
5,"A ""must read"" for anyone interested in brand identity","Too many books targeted to designers err on the side of a ""showcase"" presentation which exposes designers to the final solutions with little or no substance illuminating the process. This book will provide a comprehensive roadmap for designers and their clients.""Designing Brand Identity"" provides the information and processes to empower designers to transition into a more valuable role as consultants on identity and branding, not just the creator of visual symbols and logotypes. It is a look behind the scenes at a process which others capable of addressing have chosen to protect as proprietary information. Thanks, Alina for sharing your wisdom and experience."
2,An okay book but not worth the current second hand prices!,"DBI gives a pleasant overlook of the branding process illustrated with various examples. It is however not a guidline to creating/building/maintaining a brand, so in this the title is misleading.Warning:There are tons of compairable books around of equal or better quality. Only for those you don't have to fork out +/- $99,- to buy it second hand here!!! The book is not antique, the book not a life altering experience and the content is not worth more than $20,- second hand, so beware not to be tricked into paying quadruple the price it is really worth!"
1,Only for hard-core collectors,"I would only buy this book if you are a hard-core Jim Morrison fan and you are trying to collect every book out there about him. Not only did this book NOT teach me anything about Jim's religious beliefs, it really didn't teach me anything about the described religions either. The English translation was very hard to follow and interpret most of the time."
1,Very poorly done and ridiculous - should be no stars,"This book is ridiculous, poorly put together and a sham. Don't waste your money. Should be zero stars"
3,Nice descriptive writing... but very uneven plot,"Momaday writes some beautiful prose. Too bad the story line is so choppy. Characters come and go and Set and Grey interact with them. Billy the kid is fantasized by Grey, Set turns into a bear...well sort of. A strange boy appears here and there. And at the end it all comes together...NOT!I goota give Momaday a 3 for his prose but a 1 for his plot development."
2,not so good,"While it is somewhat interesting to read a novel in which dreams and reality meld together, I found *this* novel to be vastly uninteresting. The main characters don't hold my attention at all. The storytelling is poor since the issues and themes are buried under a haphazard narration. My suggestion: don't invest time or money in this book."
3,good for strength training and beginners,"I too was expecting from the cover and title a kick butt cardio workout. Instead, I got a DVD for beginners who want to strength train to build up to kickboxing. I enjoyed the workout, but treated it as something I woudl do on a recovery day rather than a tough workout. It is great for beginners in that it teaches you intermediary steps to doing punches and kicks, as well as teaching your form."
5,Fantastic Workout!!!,"This is a great workout, I collect a lot of workout DVD's, some of them collect dust, but not this one. This workout has a martial arts cardio section first, then Violet moves you into a martial arts inspired strength training workout, which is fantastic!!!! Being a Black Belt already with this DVD my moves have become stronger!"
3,Can't Fast Forward Through Commercials,"There are a few commercials at the beginning of this that takes 4 minutes and there's no way to fast forward or skip them. It's really frustrating. I don't want to do this DVD sometimes because, as a mother of two small children, every minute counts. The workout itself is okay, though kind of dull."
4,The Trainer's Edge,I definitely am improving on my punches and kicks with this video. Violet Zaki is a great instructor! At first I didn't really feel like this was a cardio workout but then I began focussing more on my form and I definitely began feeling it. The one thing I think the video could improve on is the background. Very bland and sterile not bright and fun.
5,Great Until The End,"Ruth Chatterton is a find, and I had never heard of her before or seen any of her movies. She is the star of this film and carries it marvelously. Ruth is the president of a car manufacturing company similar to GM. She takes on the role of leader and acts like a man and is a decisive leader for the company. She even has an entourage of male subordinates and secretaries who answer to her every whim. She eventually falls in love with George Brent (her husband in real life) who is a working man and she learns to allow him to be in charge and becomes a lowly woman so she can have the joy of marriage and babies. Before the disappointing end, Ruth's character is a strong, competent, wise-cracking woman. One who would be deemed a feminist role in the future. A hidden gem."
4,Thought provoking quick read,"This book is a collection of essay/lectures Eco has presented. They range over a variety of interesting philosophical issues -- which are well presented and thought out. The theme throughout is that incorrect ideas can result in useful results. Like all of Eco's writing (with which I am familiar) his ideas require some attention and thought on the part of the reader. But this was for me a very accessible book, perhaps reflecting its origin as lectures, and well worth reading."
3,You will probably enjoy it more than I did...,"First, I must assume that if you're considering reading this book you are a student of history, language, or perhaps the history of language. I am none of these and was given the book as ""something I thought you'd enjoy"". Even so, I found the book thought provoking and well written. I feel that the failing in this endeavor was my own, for I do not posess enough historical knowledge to relate to the constant references and source material quoted by Eco. I'll just say that I still found the book more worthwhile than the latest ""bestseller"".As stated above, I must assume that most anyone reading this, or considering the book will have more of an interest in the subject matter."
5,eco at his best,"very funny and delightful, illustrates his points very well, Great reading for smart people who want to know how ideas get teansmuted."
4,Great value!,"I bought this product along with an Ipod for my mother. I wanted something that would be easy to teach her to use and would have decent sound. This product delivers just that. It is extremely simple to set up and use. It also offers great sound. I was worried about the quality because of the great price, but it sounds great. The only con we have found it that it does not charge the Ipod while it is in the base."
3,Great sound,This is little and light weight. It produces a great sound. I have yet to figure out how it charges your i-pod!!! I have to charge my i-pod on my computer!!!
1,Altec Lansing inMotion iM500 - Does NOT charge iPod Nano 5th Gen,"I'm absolutely disgusted with this purchase - the sounds quality, while not optimal, is the least of my problems. I plugged my iPod Nano (5th Generation) into it and found out (the HARD WAY!) that it will not charge my iPod. Now I must try to get my money back which I envision will be an uphill battle as this seller does NOT accept returns."
2,Lacking parts,I purchased this item in August 2009 and it arrived without the plug to use in the USA. I was called about it and assured the correct plug would be forthcoming but it never arrived. I managed to use another universal plug and it worked for a few months before the ipod charger died. I would not buy it again. Buyer beware.
5,Nano Speakers,"This was a present for my wife. She asked for a Nano IPOD with speakers for her to listen to at work as she prepares lesson plans. I looked a several models, brands and for the price and sound quality she likes it very much. About $45.00, so not the high end of $450.00 BOSE, but not the cheapest for $20.00. Priced right, new out of the box."
3,Much smaller than I thought,I bought this doll online for 14.89 but was very dissappointed with the size. It is much smaller than what I thought. The book is a waste of money. The print is too small. For this price I could have gotten something better.
5,Great gift - well made,"My girls have loved collecting the mini dolls by AG. They read all the books and then play with the dolls once they learn their character stories. It has replaced barbie dolls in our house. Priced not much more than a barbie, it is so much more educational and fun for the girls. A great way to get them to love reading - and history!!"
1,I Expected More,"The doll was very small & I don't even know that the book was with the set, if it was, it was really small. I returned the product without fully opening, the doll alone wasn't what I was expecting."
3,Worked OK,"The pre-wax cleaner was able to get some marks off that weren't coming off with just washing, as well as a few small swirls. There was one small scratch that I thought this would be able to remove, but it was unable to remove it, as well as some yellow pollen type stuff.All and all, I thought the product was just OK."
2,Not as good as normal Polishing Compound,"After years of using the Step 2 Sealer & Glaze and Step 3 Carnuba Wax Systems, I switched from using Turtle Wax Polishing Compound(the lightest version of Polishing Compound on the market) to this Pre-Wax Cleaner from Mothers.After using the Mothers 3 Step System with Pre-Wax Cleaner for about 4 years now, the Pre-Wax Cleaner just isn't strong enough for the scratches that need a bit stronger compound. I've given it it's fair time with about 4 different bottles of application, but always keep handy the Turtle Polishing Compound to remove scratches that periodically appear."
3,handy product,This is a great product for my bald head and other things exposed to the sun. It works for a few times then inevibly the stick breaks off in the tube. Probably from the heat of the beach. also any sand will jam the raising and lower mechanism keeping the product from even working. Clarins is really good stuff - just get the regular 30 in a tube and skip the complex technology. Not rugged enough for hot beach environment.
5,Wonderful recording,One of the best choir recordings that I ever bought! simply stunning. There will be rest is a highlight but the entire hour is well invested if spent listening to all of it.
4,Pleasurable listening,"Another excellent release by Charles Bruffy with his forces from Phoenix and Kansas. This choir sounds great. The music is interesting, though not the best. This makes for pleasant listen of you like expressive and meaningful choral music."
3,"Nice, but tuning?","While they certainly have a lovely sound, its hard to discount the lack of approach to tuning, especially the opening of the Martin which is down a half step by the second measure of the piece. I have enjoyed their recordings in the past, but the lack to review has caused a severe ensemble issue. Indeed the Gloria follows suit down a half step. etc..."
4,Dump the censors,"We learned that some libraries were BANNING Dougal The Garbage Dump Bear because some people who probably had not read the book believed that it was bad for children since Dougal and his friends played pool while consuming ginger beer. The book is a good story of a a bear that is left alone, found by a kind hearted person and thrives with the love that he is given. The book is a positive learning experience and should be shared, not banned. Perhaps if those seeking to ban Dougal would open their hearts and minds to the world, they could enjoy their interactions with others while on this planet."
4,Adequate Storage Set,We bought these for long term storage of our china. All 12 of our place settings fit in each fabric holder. There was even space for the plastic wrapping to stay on the plates/bowls for added padding between each item.The only downside is that the entire set is soft-sided. It would have been nice to have a cardboard piece for the top/bottom for a little added protection.
3,,"This record is a triumph. Masters of symphonic black metal -without all the `happy factors' attached to it, which is common on most bands playing this style- Thyrane has more in common with Swedish blast-beat oriented bands than your typical flowery black metal. By combining speed and melody efficiently, the band doesn't stray away from the important elements that make extreme metal a hot commodity in Finland. Overall, this is a satisfactory effort that's just as good as their previous opus. 3.5/5"
3,Heavy Duty Plug Receptacle,"This is a substantial,heavy duty receptacle.However,mounting screws are shiny,cheap metal.Torquing too much will shear the screws requiring drilling out the broken screw,or drilling new fastener holes through the facia,leaving a sloppy looking installation.It's unbelievable a product this good would have packaged such cheap fasteners.This product needs better screws,or none packaged,because the receptacle requires one to insert plug,and twist to lock in,requiring a solid mount."
5,From Now Till Eternity,"I could hardly wait to receive this book, when I got it I could hardly wait to open it, having opened it I am 100% SATISFIED. This was one of the first purchases for me and indeed I am a satisfied customer of Amazon. Thank you Amazon for facilitating this purchase."
4,"Good music, but not his or Senegal's best album.","I enjoy this cd, but I don't love it. It's a pleasant listening experience, but there is no song on it that I would classify as among my all-time favorites.N'Dour has a wonderful voice, well worth getting to know, and the quality of the playing is excellent. However, I believe that most people from Western countries who would buy this album are intrigued by music from Africa and want to try something different. Therefore it is the very fact that this album sounds quite a bit like Western pop that bothers me. I wish that the, to me, exotic African elements were more to the fore, and the everyday pop elements were less evident. If you also are interested in this singer because you want to listen to something out of the ordinary, I would suggest you buy instead a cd by Cheikh Lo, who is also from Senegal. Lo's music is more obviously unusual, and yet very beautiful. One of N'Dour's less Westernized albums would also be more appropriate."
5,Beautiful Music,"His Best work in my opinion! I've had the pleasure of seeing him in concert a few times and this man is truely gifted! I would reccomend all of his CDs but if there's one that you must have, it should be this one."
5,I love these shoes.,"If you hate to wear socks and want to look classy while doing it, these are the ones you want to get. The comfort is amazing, they come with these awesome comfort gel for your heel which is a big plus when you have to walk a lot. The laces on these are durable as well. Overall this was an awesome buy and for the price you can't beat it. I will buy another pair once these get worn out which I doubt it'll be anytime soon."
5,Nunn Bush Men's,"Received in a short amount of time after ordering. Packaged well, there was no shipping damage. Well made with a good and comfortable fit."
5,EXCELLENT!!!! KEEP THIS PRODUCT COMING..,I love these shows they are so witty and so not your typical programing we have today. Thank you Amazon for bringing these or making it avaiable to us in the USA..
5,Season 6,"New characters appear to the regular series cast.A new German General,the brother of Roger Leclerc due the Jack Haig death,a new British intelligence girl that helps stupid agent Crabtree.The two British airmen atill in Nouvion despite the efforts of Resistance to send them to England.New plots and situations happens as Gestapo officers Flick and Von Smallhausen interfere with German army.Hope to see new seasons soon."
3,More Allo Allo,Some of the humour getting a bit repetitive but still fun to watch. The charactors are excellent and well portrayed
1,horiable,"What a heap of crap, it must be the only DVD of many I have brought that does not start of with a menu. I would not waste my money on ""their choice"" I love 'Allo 'Allo great British comedy, in the end I had to find the ""index"" button on the remote to bring up the menu, then it was great just like series 1,,2,3,4,5. that I have already (UK versions)I gave 1 Star, 10 stars for 'Allo 'Allo -9 for the introduction."
3,Works well - not durable,This works very well for the occasional project. We used it for a woodworking project for 7 kids and it's already becoming inaccurate due to wear. Works OK for the price I paid and I will concede that the kids had something to due with its impending demise.
3,Hit and miss,This product is study but not accurate. I had to cut some 45 angles and they did not come out as I would like. To get good cuts the key is to saw very slowly which is fine for small tasks but is time consuming for larger. A nice DIY tool versus the cost of a mitre saw once it is not a tool used frequently.
2,CHEAPLY MADE,"While this Stanley Mitre box does the job, the materials used are on the cheap size and it does not have a sturdy feel to it. Would expect more from a product that Stanley puts its name on."
5,Great Handsaw,"I originally purchased this STANLEY SAW to use to cut some low-hanging branches off a tree in the backyard. The saws of my dad's were all rusted and I came across this saw for around $10. Besides the limb-cuttings, I have used it to cut several small trees, to cut through a 1x4"", and to cut through some scraps of luan. After all that use, the teeth have remained sharp and clean. I'm looking forward to using this saw for a long time. It's a good hand, inexpensive handsaw."
5,GOOD PRODUCT,I have been upgrading my tools and my old saw was quite rusty. Found this one on Amazon.com and have used a few times. Good price on a name brand from Amazon.com
4,Best Borges Biography,"This is the best Borges' biography I've read so far but, as usual, his biographers are not his best critics, and his life is better told by himself in a number of interviews and his own brief autobiography. Still, if you have to get one, get this one. The biographer died a few years earlier than the biographed, but the latest editions bring the chronology up to date. But yes, for a detailed ""ending"", you'll have to go somewhere else.Still, Borge's life happened more inside libraries and the books he read and wrote, than in the so called ""real"" world. So, read his books first."
3,As oldie but worth watching!,St. Vincent was an extraordinary man and he certainly deserves to be remembered with fondness. This is a very old film but still worth watching.
5,St Vincent,Not what I had expected to see but truly did enjoy this movie. I'm sure you will too if you enjoy 'old movies'.
4,A nice movie,This movie is nice. I like movie with spanish languaje. This movie only have subtitle in spanish. However is the real story. The movie is black and withe for the time in wich maked. For all them is a good movie and interesting.
2,St. Vincent de Paul: technically not so good,"The subject matter is good, but the film is technically inferior, in black and white, with difficult auditory at times. Also, we thought the story lacked continuity, which made it hard to follow historically. I would not spend the money on this film again."
3,Marian Montogermy - Jazz Singer Extrodinaire!,"""Marian Swings for Winners and Losers"" is probably the only album that is worth searching the world over for. It was her first US effort with Cal Tjader, Kenny Burrell to name just two of the expert musicians on this sitting on this music event. If you can get your hands on this out of print LP (have not seen it issued on CD) you've got some of the best jazz vocal work ever done and that includes Ella. The musicians and Marian's voice were like one and that is a rare occurence. After her death I contacted her husband and he sent me a cd copy from the original studio engineered tape. After that, any other pales in comparison."
1,Let There Be Quiet,"This is actually two albums in one. The first is incredibly bad. Why anyone, even back in the early 60s would start off a studio album with Bill Bailey is completely beyond me. It is an insipid song that should be used only as filler for a live performance. Montgomery, with her rhythmic insanity, made me feel as if someone were shooting at me with a nail gun. Then there is the exaggerated nasal delivery. Awful!!! Even though Montgomery's singing on the second album improves tremendously, the arrangements are horrible with their relentless, organ-driven ""swing."" This album should definitely be among the first sent to the surface of the sun."
4,Worthwhile,"This whole series is cute, inexpensive and a big hit with our daughters. I prefer ""Knock, Knock"" but for the price, all the books in the series are worthwhile."
4,just the answer i was looking for,"I work on construction equipment ""air compressors and generators"". It helps to clamp this on and beat it like a neighborhood bully. I use it every day and don't think it will last more than a year but it really helps stubborn and rusted bolts......"
5,Looks like a good idea,"I have not yet had a chance to use this tool. I sure seems like a good idea though. The only disappointment was the "" Made in China "" on the tag."
3,"Pretty ingenious, better options out there","Update from prior review (below dashed lines):If you're willing to spend more $ (a LOT more $), there is something so much better than this or any crescent/adjustable wrench out there. Search for ""knipex pliers wrench."" It's fantastic. Truly, fantastic. This tool, which I originally thought was super neat, is going to be given away.------------------Prior Review:If you need and are going to buy a crescent wrench, then you might as well get this one (assuming the extra cost isn't an issue). You don't HAVE to use the locking function, but you have it when you need it.IMO, it would be better if:a. It adjusted with the handle slide mechanism that is becoming more popular. I much prefer that method.b. The jaws opened up more (or there were a larger size). Usually it's larger bolts that you need to clamp down on."
3,Lower quality than the one they copied.,"I used to have the original version of this. Loved it. This one is sort of OK, but poorly machined of softer metal. I still like it enough to keep, mostly for where I want the tightness of a Vise Grip but not the marring of the sharper teeth of a Vise Grip."
4,One great crescent-vice grip.,"I have tons of tools, but few really good ones that really help...This one is the exception. My vice grips do a great job, yet can be difficult to use when fixing large pipes that require a a solid grip when having to use brute force. This tool solved the problem with an adjustable whench head that locks to a specific size when fitted. I have used it several time in removing large rusted bolts and nuts and was impressed by it's ability to handle to tough tasks without constantly having to adjust. If you are thinking of buying a set of vice grips, consider this as a viable alternative."
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"Do not waste any time or money on this sub-par collection of poor quality (both technical and just bad movies). The film and sound quality are horrible. A little money spent on improving image and sound quality would have gone a long way, but obviously this was not the case. at least a few times, the audio becomes completely inintelligible, and the video quality; well, lets just say it's obvious these are old movies. If you are interested in this type of film, spend a little extra per individual DVD, and pick up some that have been properly reconstructed."
1,The worst product I have ever seen. Don't Buy!!!!,"These skis are cheap pieces of junk. The instructions are terrible, the spring system doesn't work. Save yourself the money and just make your own. In all honesty this is the worst product I have ever bought."
3,Good little set..,"I bought this set because I was looking for something that would be small enough to tighten my reading glasses screws that were a little loose but unfortunately the set did not come with the right size, its hard to tell how small or how big a screw is until you test it (unless you have knowledge of screw sizes).It comes in a very nice little handy case and the tools seem to be of good quality but this is more for electricians or people that need/deal with very small fine screwdriver jobs.So if you need this for work or you simply want to add a nice small organized tool set to the house tool box it may just work fine but its not for all glasses."
5,Excellent set,"Exactly what i needed. This replaced a previous set I lost that was all metal, but thinner. These have a nice thickness to them that makes it easier to turn and apply pressure with both your palm as well as your fingers to avoid stripping the heads. They don't feel as substantial as my previous set (which I can't recall who made that set) because this one is plastic, but it doesn't feel cheap. For the price, good value and good set."
5,These have been great screwdrivers,I have worked on many laptops and other items with small screws with this set for a couple of years. I have damaged the flat heads using them as prybars but that is all my doing. Probably going to buy another set soon.
4,Another Superior Product from Stanley,"This set of 6 screwdrivers is better for real-world work than the minute sets I've had in the past. I'll keep this in my tool kit for fine work, and my Lee Valley/Veritas set for most work. Most heartily recommended, if you need a set of small screwdrivers."
1,Horrible.,"Bought this set to loosen the screws on the bottom plate of my Nikon-d60 camera. The proper-sized phil head removed a few screws, but was itself stripped more with each screw, until it was no longer functional.Total waste of money, cheap metal. Perhaps in other circumstances these will work out fine, but for my purposes they failed horribly."
5,"Cheap, good set","Very nicely packaged, the price is right, and with magnetic tips, you can't go wrong with this. This set will do exactly what you want."
5,Works well for intended use,"I got these to use on my glasses, and they work well. There are 4 small flatheads and 2 small Philips. The top part fits a finger pretty well, and rotates as you turn it, which is very practical. Not much else to say."
3,"Good product, lousy case","The product is great, but the case it comes in is not. It's cheap and has already chipped. It's hard to unsnap. Could have come up with a simpler design. But the feel of the screwdrivers and utility of them is good."
5,Nice and Simple,I bought this for a specific task that I knew required the smaller screwdriver's. The tools preformed as expected and I've used them more often than I had initially thought I would. Highly recommended.
5,a handy set,"Exactly what you need for a new home~ Of course if you have something that needs powerful screw drivers, you might want to consider a electronic one. Anyway, this kit is a must~"
3,Stunned by Quality,"I was totally shocked at the high quality for something so cheap. I have had tons of little screwdriver sets and this one is the best so far by a long shot.Update: 5-20-2011The screwdrivers are holding up well, but I have found them to be slippery and worst of all not fitting the screws well. I just stripped out a macbook screw so Im am not happy. Spend the extra bucks and get the german made Wiha. Live and learn huh."
5,Always Useful,"We lost our other set and believe me, one doesn't realize how useful this little kit can be. Searched all over and was so happy to find it on ""Amazon.com"". Eyeglasses, little toys, etc., this product is outstanding!"
2,terrible grips,"This is a nice variety of screwdrivers for the price, but the ""grips"" are round and slippery so you can't apply any torque whatsoever. They're pretty much useless for loosening screws."
1,Product Recieved is not the one advertised,"The picture advertised needs to be changed. The one star is simply because the sets I purchased are worthless for what I needed them for due to the wrong picture online.This set of screwdrivers does not come in the very resilient slide case shown in the picture. You will recieve a set of those screwdrivers in an open face box with just a little strap across the center of screwdrivers. While the cheap-o box that is now shipping is fine if you are throwing these on a shelf at home, I recently lost a set of the pictured screwdrivers which were perfect for carrying in my laptop bag. The big difference is the new packaging will allow cords and other items to come into contact with the sharp screwdriver blades... which is a bad thing.Ordering online is all about the visuals presented and in this case the product pictured does NOT match the product shipped."
4,Not a bad deal!,How can you go wrong for $4 :-P But the case is a little tricky and I have to see how things go... so only gets a 4 so far...
5,Tools look very handy!,"I have not used the tools yet, but I am sure that they will come in handy at some point."
2,Doesn't work for laptops,"Yeah, this doesn't really work well with little laptop screws (#00 or #0) screws if that is what you are looking for. It didn't work for me, but given the price, it is a neat toolkit. I bought this for the sole purpose of removing the HDD / RAM and upgrade to SSD and higher memory in my Dell Inspiron. Using the star #0 and #1 on this set made my problem worse. I ended up with stripped screws and having to invest in something more powerful to work with small screws that need heavy torque. This is probably useless to me now since it didn't work well, but given the price, the product seems to be okay for the $6 I paid for it. I would go for slightly expensive precision tools for laptop screws rather than this set."
1,Can't fix eyeglasses,"The blades are all too thick to fit the screws on my eyeglasses, which was the only thing I bought the set for.I got the same set that adam284 uploaded the photo of, which is fine, just different than they picture. Thanks for the photo, Adam."
2,eyeglasses screwdrivers,"Found as eyeglass screwdriver, it was a nice little set but none fit my eyeglasses."
1,Not what I expected,"I didn't realize that these are really very small, short, and delicate screwdriveers. Under the product dimensions, I read that they were 12 inches so I was thinking they would be, well, longer than they are, which in reality is probably more like 5 inches with the actual metal part maybe only a little over an inch. I guess I should have realized that when they said 12 inches, maybe they were talking about the size of the packaging.... They are very lightweight and not really meant for any kind of serious screwdriving. :-("
2,Faulty BICs?,"I've used BICs before. These seem a little off. When I click to get more lead, the lead seems to free fall out of the pencil."
2,"Confusing terms, doesn't offer much new advice","I had to purchase this book for a required writing course at my university. The book tries to address writing issues with examples and tips, but uses it's own terms that make the whole writing process confusing. It is an okay book if you have a lot of time to process what you are actually reading and if you are not very familiar with advanced writing moves."
2,disappointing,"I was required to purchase this book for my senior year of nursing school. There are a lot of typos, some of the mnemonics are confusing, and some are just ridiculous! They are really reaching on some of these, which makes them not easily memorable. I will not be keeping this book to use as a reference when I'm a new nurse."
2,not the best,"I must report that I have experience with medications. I thought this would be a little better for remembering medications. It was recommended by a fellow student, who is new to medications. This book may be okay for a new person, but for me it was a waste of money."
5,It made everything click!,"This is an excellent book for visual learners (like me!). I just received my book in the mail and have started studying. Reading/coloring/mnemonics has made studying fun for me! It is still a filler book (not a text book and they don't claim to be) but it helps everything connect. Saturday night I read the section on cardiac drugs, then on Sunday I did the questions in my Saunders NCLEX review book and everything clicked in my brain. Everything connected. I am very excited to go through this book. This book is making Pharmacology fun for me."
4,"helpful, but limited","Great price and fast shipping. The book has some very helpful mnemonics but I did not find all of the drugs I needed. I would recommend this book to all nursing students. Although the downside is that it did not cover all of the drugs used in class, it was very helpful for the ones it did have."
2,Insane not incredible.,If you are contemplating this book for NCLEX or HESI prep I would say change course and get Nursing Pharmacology Made INCREDIBLY easy and not this book. Several friends of mine have INCREDIBLY easy and I decided to buck the trend and try this one instead. Well now I realize that I was INSANE to purchase this instead.
3,Pharmacology Made Insanely Easy!,"Good book, maybe a little too basic. I won't be throwing away my Richard Lenhe Pharmacology text anytime soon. Pharmacology Made Insanely Easy was a required purchase for a Pharmacology Workshop done by the author, which was ok. It definately did not get over anyone's head."
4,Extremely Helpful,My professor let me borrow this book to prepare for the NCLEX and it helped me 100%!!!!
3,NOT CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY!!!!!!,"I bought this book on a whim, hoping that it would have more clinically related subject matter. However, much to my dismay, the subject matter is directed toward those in the field of nursing. Don't take it the wrong way, I love nurses! Married one ;-) However, for those in PA, NP, or Med school, this is not the book I would recommend. Look for Clinical Pharmacology Made Ridiculously Simple and/or Incredibly Easy... These books are written with the clinical provider in mind. Be prepared for A LOT of memorization, however. Pharm, as we say in Texas, ""Don't come easy..."""
3,It's ok,The pictures are good but the book format is not my favorite. Spiral card stock is more user friendly for this type of information.
2,Pages were falling out from the book binding.,"Pharmacology Made Insanely Easy. The book looked like a new book, but the pages were falling out from the binding without prompting.."
2,Disappointing; not entirely dependable,"I bought this book, so I'm using it, but finding its helpfulness to be uneven. Some of the info seems to be either slightly outdated or at least has large gaps. For example, I've just used it to review Type II diabetes meds we were given in lecture, and it doesn't have any info at all about 2 of the 5 categories of NIDDM drugs I'm supposed to be familiar with. It also has an awful lot of typos, which disappoints me that it seems nobody proofread it with much care.On the positive side, I do think the little drawings and mnemonics will help me remember the info I find helpful. So it isn't worthless, but I hope to eventually find a better pharm review book."
1,"Filthy, Promiscuous, Whorish for ""PG"" ???","This movie does NOT deserve ""1"" Star.I literally threw it into the circular file ,,, aka the garbage can.A few minutes into the movie ,,, the four chosen ""experts"" are gathered together by their new employer and told of their mission.

2,Awful,"2 hour Sci Fi Channel predictible film, Pretty bad acting all around coupled with horrific pacing and you get a ... Sci Fi Channel film."
1,The Plot Must have also gotten lost in the triangle,"I dont even know where to begin! I rented this Miniseries because I have always been fascinated by the Mystery of the Bermuda Triangle! For fans of the Bermuda Triangle, Dont wast your time with this Mess! The Miniseries makes no sense whatsoever, is hard to follow and the acting is TERRIBLE! Even the so called special effects are computer generated and sadly it shows! This is by far , one of the WORST MINISERIES I have ever seen!"
4,A quick look into what's what,"This turned out to be pretty good, an extended movie if you will but will keep you interested from the beginning to the end"
2,The Triangle is a lesson in sleep TV....,"Made for Cable Movie suffers from a weak script and a waste of otherwise solid acting talent, produced by Dean Devlin and Bryan Singer, which go about as well together as oil and water."
2,when does the triangle come in?,"This story is supposed to be about the mysterious Bermuda Triangle. The title is highly misleading, since very little time is spent at the actual location. Nothing really wrong with this movie, but nothing really good either."
2,"Class ""B"" offering","Promeising plot and cast. In fact, just another low budget run-of-mill Scy-Fy wannabe thriller. I'm sorry that I didn't figure it out in advance."
1,Just Awful,"The worst Bermuda Triangle show ever. Yes even worse than the one where the devil is a castaway. Instead, there's the big evil government plot which makes no sense. The characters are terrible and I'm not sure if it's the acting that's so bad or the horrible dialogue the actors have to read. Samples include repeated: ""Oh My God"", ""My God"" and the ever popular ""You have to believe me"". A waste of your time which you'll never get back. Avoid!"
5,Brillant,"The Triangle was a brillant DVD. I loved it, but then, im partial when it comes to nature movies. It gives you some insight to the Bermuda Triangle, whether factual or fiction"
4,Enjoyable movie to watch if you are interested in the Bermuda Triangle,"I liked this mini-series because I have always been fascinated about the Bermuda Triangle. If you like learning about the Triangle or reading about it then you will like this show. This flick contains some good actors such as Lou Diamond Phillips and Eric Stoltz plus more. The theories I think are spot on but could be possible that that is what is actually happening out there and if you go through the Bermuda Triangle, you wouldn't want to be a survivor...trust me."
4,Edge of your seat stuff.,I loved it from the moment that I started to watch the show. Action packed and fun to watch it's a must for anyone who loves a great mystery
5,A Phenomenal Book,"Frankly I don't usually take the time out to read works of fiction but as the book came highly recommended by my fiancé I decided to give it my attention. I was surprisingly pleased and utterly impressed by everything this book offers. The writing is noticeably superior to most the books I have read, and the story that was told was one that needs to be embraced and understood. I believe it is the kind of book that anyone would find favor in reading."
5,A Wonderful Book,"I recently read a novella, which was written by the author of this book. It was a wonderful piece of work. I was so affected by it that I immediately searched for more of his works, and to my delight I found this book. The book had a tremendous affect on me: from tears of sadness, to feelings of joy. Seeing and feeling through his eyes was a very enlightening, arousing, seductive and even erotic experience. He is clearly a master of language and he captures scenes and emotions so well that for me they were no less than real. This work will awaken fires in you; it will please and astound you with what it offers page after page, until finally you find sadly you are at the end and with nothing more to continue, except to go back to the beginning and find yourself overwhelmed all over again as I did."
5,Shared Enthusiasm,"A few weeks back I overheard a conversation between two women at the coffee shop where I work at part-time. They were engrossed with something that was written in a book that one of the ladies was holding. When I went over to take their order they shared their enthusiasm with me about the book by reading a part from somewhere in the middle; and from that moment on I was a fan. That very evening when I got home from work I ordered my own copy, and after the few rather anxious days it took for the book to arrive I began my voyage into a world you absolutely must discover for yourself. Every single page I read was a more precise and truer picture of living and loving. Through it's beautiful scenes I was easily swept away from my little room to someplace where nothing at all was quieted or lost. I couldn't begin to imagine what inspired the writer to write the book, but whatever it was it must have been beyond tremendous."
5,Lonely Planet New Zealand (9th edition),We just returned from a one month excursion through Nea Zealand with this guide book constantly at our side. We found it invaluable in our daily selection of things to do and places to stay and eat. During our travels we also noted this guide being used by many other travellers and particularly in the hands of the hikers and backpackers. It was the most prominent of guide books available in the book shops and information centers throughout the country. Should be required reading by anyone preparing an unescorted visit to New Zealand and even for anyone on an organized tour it would be most helpful.
3,Best to be read BEFORE going!,"When I went to New Zealand armed with my Lonely Planet guide and one small travel bag, I found that the book did not go into enough detail about the best places to go, especially in Christchurch and at the Milford Sound/Queenstown area. The book has lots of info but is quite heavy to carry around for 3 weeks. It would be helpful if the Lonely Planet separated the book into two-North Island and South Island for the traveler who is trying to travel carrying the least amount of weight. Next time I will copy the info and carry on a few pages rather than a two inch thick book. The country is NOT to be missed, a magical land!"
4,Don't Buy This Edition,"The Guide is very informative, but there is a new edition that has come out in October, so wait to buy the new one!!"
4,lonely planet new zealand,"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE MOST HELPFUL IN PARTS, AND SCARES OF INFORMATION IN OTHER AREAS.ITS CLEAR AND EASY TO READ, WITH A LITTLE HUMOR TO KEEP YOU SMILING AS YOU READ.I FOUND IT MOST ANNOYING WHEN READING ABOUT CERTAIN AREAS AND NOT HAVING A STREET/AREA MAP TO FIND THE PLACE, BUT OTHER WISE OVER-ALL A VERY THOUGHT OUT, PLANED BOOK FOR THE LONE/GROUP TRAVELER(S).INFORMATION ON SAFETY COULD BE UP-GRADED !!!!"
1,Inadequate bolt,"The lamp would have been fine if not for the bolt which the lamp swivels on and is supported by. This bolt is too weak and wound up bending while I was in the process of postioning the lamp to desired location. I expect it will eventually break off and render the lamp useless.Grandrich 100-Watt Incandescent Architects Swing Arm Light, Black #G-2518 BLK"
2,Poorly Designed,"Although the lamp proper is fairly good in design, the base clamp does NOT fit the lamp for beans. The ""Bolt"" or ""rod"" that is supposed to fit in the clamp/base is about 1/2"" in diameter, the clamp base unit has a hole in it that's about 9/16"" in diameter letting the lamp catch on the base when turned and will ""wobble"" or swing back and forth some 3-4 inches (And yes that's three to four inches!) at the first bend in the lamp arms. VERY poor design. A replacement base was the same as the original. If I need to purchase another lamp for our work benches it will NOT be this one!"
1,JUNK,This is junk - don't waste your time. I've had it for 10 minutes and it's broken. The lamp shade broke off the bracket while simply screwing in the light bulb! Not even one minute of functioning. I've got the return labels all printed out. Others are correct in that the base that clamps on the desk does not fit the lamp. Junk.
1,Not worth it,"I just opened the package for this lamp. The shade is not connected to the lamp. There are no instructions or parts on how to attach the shade to the the lamp. There is a part on the arm that appears to hold the shade but the shade has no place to attach anything to it.I think the price is double what it is worth.I had a similar one before but it apparently wore out after 20 years. This one, I cannot even assemble.I am sending it back tomorrow."
3,Nice lamp; poor base clamp,"As others have mentioned, the clamp base is too big for the lamp. The hole in the base is 0.54"", while the post on the lamp is 0.50"". This leads to unacceptable wobble. If you really want the lamp, you can use a screwdriver to spread open the post a bit to fit better, and then file the rough spots.Other than that, it seems well made."
1,JUNK,This item is flimsy in construction and materials. The lamp shade will bend easily (it is very thin and gives to the touch). The clamp on base allows the lamp to wobble. The lamp base insert is too thin and obviously will not be durable. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
2,Clip Part,"Not happy with this one. Where it clips on was not easy, does not wrok well, cannot be moved easily. It is already thrown out."
5,Elves at Juilliard and the Nakamichi Dragon,"Drawing on six or eight different traditions of magic and folktales, Mercedes Lackey and Rosemary Edgehill have poured it all in a magic cauldron and swirled up a terrific sequel to Beyond World's End. Where else can you find a blue-skinned Rick in Casablanca, or a fox with nine tails that sounds like a street huckster (wanna see what I got under da coat?) or a dragon whose main interest is his Nakamichi CD player. This book has nearly everything: gargoyles, good elves, bad elves, tyrannical music professors, and slow talking hillbilly musicians who turn into Bard Guardians. I _still_ wanna ride Lady Day. This book is complex, funny, wise, and a whacking good read."
2,Definite Disappointment,"The book, despite the inconsistencies that have been pointed out by other reviewers, moves along with an interesting and well-paced plotline. Well....for two-thirds of the book, that is. Sadly, Goblin Market was much too similar to the Bazaar from Robert Asprin's Myth series. The pathetic nod to Fritz Leiber's Fafrhd and the Gray Mouser was enough to make one retch at first read. And then the storyline devolves and becomes something right out of the X-Files with a good splash of Tolkien and Chinese myth tossed in for fun. Mercedes Lackey is well known for her character depth -- not in this one. A very bad writing indeed."
3,Decent Sequel,"While I enjoyed Spirits White as Lightning, i think that the authors can definately do better. the characterization is flat and uninteresting, each character has a trait that is basically all that is mentioned about them.Interesting to see Tannim and Chinthliss (from the SERRAted Edge series) in this book, but the caracters are again flat and one sided. Each chapter is told from a different point of view but there are about 3 different stories going on at the same time. while this could have worked the stories have only a tenuous relationship to each other.Basically while this book is fine for a light read it has no depth of character whatsoever and a plot that jumps around with every scene being somewhere else. I wouldn't buy this book (defineatly not in hardcover)but would get it from my library."
3,OK book,"This is an ok book. Compared to the other books in this series it lacks almost everything. There is no heart, no deep introspection, no character development. As a stand alone novel this is confusing. Eric's first weekend has two Sundays. He has to coax Lady Day into becoming a car and then doesn't need her to be a car. There were a lot of missed catches in this book."
4,A mamoth read but well worth it !,"I really enjoyed this book, even though the size of it in hardcover was rather intimidating. From the first pages I was thoroughly entranced, and I was thrilled when some of the characters from the SERRAted edge came into the novel. I really enjoyed the fast paced action, and the humour that was subtly threaded through the work. I would recommend that you read Beyond Worlds End before you try and read this novel, it would also help to read the Tannim books in the SERRAted edge and the two Bedlam Bard books.A great read over the weekend, all I can say is that I can't wait for another book in the series (come on - there has to be another one with an ending like this!)"
4,Very Helpful Guide,Just returned from 1 week business/pleasure visit to Shanghai and I found this guide full of good recommendations and descriptions were accurate. Better than Lonely Planet's Best of Shanghai which I also bought.
4,Time Out Shanghai - quite helpful,"I recently used TO Shanghai to navigate a business trip to the city: quite a useful guide with plentiful restaurant, watering hole and sight-seeing suggestions. I'd definintely purchase a Time Out guidebook again (I love the mags!)."
2,Great Curlers - TERRIBLE CLIPS,"I really like this type of curler; it gets hot & holds the hair well. However, the CLIPS ARE THE WORST - THEY DON'T HOLD THE CURLER in place. Since I hate those ""velvety"" type of curlers, I tried these. Too bad the clips don't work. I have shoulder length, layered hair; maybe they might work on short hair - don't know, but for me the clips didn't hold AT ALL."
2,"Hmmm, there could be better books aout Leonardo","Maybe just try another book; I bought this one but since it's boring to read, I haven't read more than 5 pages."
3,Interesting and Boring too...,"How something can be interesting and boring at the same time will always amaze me, but I am happy this book was free :-)"
3,Trainers edge,"This is a very fun workout, but I find the turns hard to do (I cannot really see which way to go) and there are quite a few of them. Gisele is a very enthusiastic teachter who is very inspiring. Music is good and motivating."
3,It's okay,"I'm latin and found the dancing pretty easy to keep up with but it was freaking boring!!!! She keeps you moving and the segments are short, but I got bored and disinterested. If you have any experience dancing you'll understand but if you have never danced latin in your life then you'll probably get a kick out of it. This video was alright...nothing to write home about."
4,"Mistaken identities, princesses, and castles","Another 1001 Children's Book to Read Before I Grow Up read. Another to cross off my list.This one is action and adventure and mistaken identities and kings and beautiful princesses and castles. The ending was a little too open-ended (had to leave things open for a sequel, I suppose) for my liking, but, overall, a good read."
5,An incredible play,I just finished reading this play which inspired me to order the Emmy Award winning movie. Dr. Feldshuh took an unfortunately true story and brought it to life in a moving tragic look at medical research and racism in this country's history. I can understand why this was nominated (and was runner-up) for the Pulitzer Prize. I think it should have won!
3,Interesting book,"I bought it for my English literature class, and the book's content is meaningful. The quality of the book was good and delivery was fast."
3,Norton Anti Virus,It might be a great product however it didn't do what I wanted so I never used it.
5,FANTASTIC!!! Jackie Cooper is Great!,A superior early 30's film. Not at all stiff and holds up well 80 years later. Jackie Cooper was a better actor at 9 years old than most actors with years of experience. Emotionally stirring.
5,The Champ (1931),"Vidor's gushy tale of devotion--about a big bruiser's bottomless well of love for his charismatic kid and number-one fan--is unabashedly sentimental by today's standards, but it still gets the tear ducts flowing. The aptly named Beery, with his tugboat voice and ruffled mien, won a much-deserved Oscar, while Cooper's wrenching, precocious Dink still remains the ""Our Gang"" star's most unforgettable role. (Beery and Cooper had such a fabulous rapport they went on to star in two more films together.) With its gritty look and a knockout weepy finale, Vidor's ""The Champ"" is an undisputed winner."
5,Just what I wanted,"This book was exactly what I was looking for and came to me in great condition. The arrival date was earlier than expected, which is always a plus!"
5,Simple but utmost efficient,"Oh,My God, This book explains everything in so simple way. What matters finally is how simple and efficient a system is and this book just focusses on these two points. -Sreeni"
5,Charles Schwab deserves a Nobel Prize.,"Charles Schwab has opened the doors of investing to the masses. This book simply and clearly illustrates how to invest for one's future using an easy-to-understand, common sense style. Not only does Schwab demystify the stock market and the principles of investing, he makes you excited to get started!"
3,"Heavy duty driver, but poorly designed.","Stanley Tools labels this Contractor Grade, and it certainly is quite hefty in weight and feels heavy duty. But I found this to be an unpleasant tool to use. This is due to its long length and the large unbalanced, bulky handle, which is covered with a rough feeling rubber. Holding this tool is awkward and using it uncomfortable.The tool comes with 10 screwdriver bits, six of which are in the handle. Turning the driver knob to access the bits requires some effort. Also, the bits do not easily pop out. I had to use a pair of needlepoint pliers to pull out the bits. The driver is made in Taiwan."
4,"I've Seen Nicer Ones, But For the Price...","I've definitely seen nicer ""all-in-one"" screwdrivers, but for the price this is a good pick-up.Holds the bits nicely. Has forward and reverse ratchet.Feels solid in your hands."
4,Takes standard size replaceable bits,"The main reason I got this one was so that I could use my standard size replaceable bits. Many of the home projects I tackle use quite a few Phillips #2 screws, which tend to eat up screwdrivers. I got tired of buying entire #2 drivers, and since I already had a box of #2 screw bits for my power drill, I wanted a handheld screwdriver that took the same size bits.I agree that getting the extra bits in and out of their storage slots is kinda of annoying. But I will almost always be using just the #2 bits, so don't much care.I don't mind the big, clunky size, perhaps because I have big clunky hands.When I need to get into smaller spaces, I have other screwdrivers for that. When I need the bigger #3 or even #4 Phillips drivers, I have those already, and don't attempt to use #2 bits on those screws."
4,Good screwdriver with multiple bits,Excellent multi purpose screwdriver. My only complaint is that it is hard to turn to get at another bit. Could be my arthritis kicking in. Well worth the price and a quality tool.
2,Beware. Inaccurate product picture!,"The product picture for this screwdriver seems to indicate you get 6 socket-style bits with the screwdriver. You do not! You get 6 regular bits (Phillips, standard, etc.) and 4 ""spares"", but you do not get any socket bits -buyer beware. I've notified Amazon of this error. We will see what happens. Otherwise, this screwdriver is a solid, well crafted piece of hardware."
5,Very nice Ratcheting mechanism,I really enjoy this tool. I purchased a DuraPro 02-157 and the Ratcheting Mechanism was very bad. On this one it works well even with loose screws. A friend of mine used it a couple of times and he commented how nice it feels in his hands and loved how this screwdriver gave him leverage in certain situation which his Snap-on did not. After using the DuraPro 02-157 this screwdriver felt like a high end screwdriver to me. I have been contemplating buying a second one.
2,Falls apart easily.,"I work fixing slot machines, I've owned two of these screwdrivers. they were both unnecessarily hard to turn to change bits, and eventually would spin too loosely, there was never a middle."
5,Memories of an erudite man,"Mr. Buckley was a national leader who gave form and direction to the modern conservative movement in America. He provided the underpinning for Goldwater and Reagan. He remains a powerful voice in the movement.Clever beyond words, it was difficult not to smile and marvel watching him on Firing Line or reading his many articles. books, etc.His command of the English language, his quick sharp wit and his polished manners were a thing to behold.For those who missed those experiences and for those who want to relive them, this collection of his writings provides such an opportunity. They are thoughtful and thought-provoking -- as indeed he was. Prepare to be impressed."
2,Expensive Fruit Holders,"Although I was excited about the concept of these containers, I am quite disappointed now that they have arrived. There are only 2 and cost almost $30. I don't think the novelty is worth the price."
1,Case of the Creator,The only reason I rated this DVD so low is that the person receiving the gift was unable to watch it. He is hearing impaired. The DVD does not offer or allow for closed captioning. The DVD is being returned. It has not been viewed.
2,"Well presented, but misleading","I eagerly read his book, which contained some interesting points. But after reading it, I found myself skeptical of the claims due to the fact that this was really a sales job, not an investigative narrative as we are lead to believe. The only experts interviewed are the ones that support his argument. I don't understand why he would waste his time and effort producing this book without legitimately attempting to present the pros and cons of each argument. I would have been fine with his conclusions had he reached them honestly and without bias. Disappointing."
3,A valient attempt but falls short!,"The goal of this documentary was to reinforce faith in the people who watch it. The science behind the documentary has been interpreted to support such a model. Being person who believes in a creator, I believe we can see glimpses of G-d in this magnificent world, however we do not have enough conclusive evidence or knowledge to state G-d does exist as a fact (as the documentary concludes). The belief in a creator comes down to faith. It was well made documentary but I would not put all your faith in the science it relies upon!"
5,Eye Opening! The Truth! You will never see this on the History Channel.,"The Case for a CreatorFor anyone who doesn't believe in God you have got to see this DVD. Like Lee Strobel said, it actually requires more faith not to believe then to believe in the existence of a creator (Our God). A lot of work and research was put into this work and it's well worth it. All you have to do is see for yourself and decide at the end where you stand. Life changing!"
5,"Quite technical, but very good",One must pay close attention while viewing this and it may be over the head of one who has no prior general scientific knowledge. Very good information for evidence of God through the well-planned design of the universe.
5,The Case for a Creator,I loved this DVD. It was so good that it made me cry almost the entire movie. Very convincing scientific evidence that there is a Creator and phenomenal insight about the Creator's nature that can be observed in nature.
1,lame,"I've used the ones found in Asia and they really ZAP all kinds of insects with a POP! This product only numbs the damn annoyances. I smacked a fly it went down and before I could find something to bag the carcass it was up and at them again. I also tried a mosquito, same disappointment-- sad."
4,Handy,"Nice little saw. The blade isn't the best but works decently and the handle is all plastic. It's extremely light which could be a plus. I'm just waiting to see how well it holds up since its plastic. So far no problems, will update this post if I have any problems with it."
3,"Ok, but not for me!","This headset was light and worked very well, it just didn't fit my ear well at all. The earpiece dangled straight down in front of my ear hole, and I could not bend it to fit. If I kept a finger pressing on the earpiece, it would go into and fit my ear hole pretty well, but then I might as well have been holding the phone itself against my ear!I returned the headset for credit. I have not yet (10/27/07) received the credit for it."
3,Veterinarian approval?,"My veterinarian said not to use products with coal tar. He gave me a modern product that did the job of clearing up skin problems. If you recall, Denorex used to be on the market and they removed it because it was a coal tar product. Coal tar has been known to cause cancer. Talk to your vet before using this product on you or your dog."
2,Love it while it actually works,"Love it while it works. Unfortunately that end eventually snaps right off. First time around I assumed from carelessness. Replaced it and took care to baby that end. A few months later it just fell off anyway. That end cannot take the stress of normal use. Not even careful tender babysitting. The fold over that keeps it from totally retracting back up inside itself is very poor engineering. So, here I am buying a third one, because when its good its very very good."
3,Great....but buy more than one.,"Great little tape measure, but go ahead and buy two since the hook end is going to break off enventually. Mine only lasted a few months. I do like that it fits comfortably in my jeans watch pocket so it is always handy when one of our furniture store customers needs to know a dimension. A 5 star product with a 1 star lifespan."
4,"Compact, works well, good value","Could be manufactured a tad bit stronger, but that's not to say this falls apart easily. Fits perfectly in a pocket, yet long enough to measure most objects at home. Worth the money."
3,Great tape measure with fatal flaw,"In my pocket is one of these at all times. But it never gets too old because it's necessary to buy a new one now and then. Why? If you pull out this 10' rule a few inches more than 10' you can throw it away because it will never retract again. Sloppy engineering of the retraction mechanism. I'm leaving this review today because I'm on Amazon replacing one that got ""stretched"" measuring a rug over the weekend.If they ever re-design this, they should consider putting a hook on the end rather than a bent flange."
4,"Small, but quality","it was my fault for not reading how small this tape measure really is, but it's a quality product. best for working in small places or with small projects."
5,Super tool...,This is an ideal pocket tool. They are hard too find. I bought six of them just for me. I carry one in my pocket at all times. The locking feature permits me to lock a measurement that is out of my view and then read it.
4,Well built,"This product is well made and works great. I have no complaints. Lightweight and functional, and very durable. Good product."
5,Ecclesiastical Neimoidian!,"Glad to have the Bishop -- er, I mean, Senator finally represented in plastic. Like the other Neimoidian figures (Nute Gunray, Rune Haako) the playability is pretty much limited to ""arms go up, arms go down"" but this one comes with a Darth Sidious hologram (which makes more sense as an accessory for Nute & Rune) and his miter can be removed (so he can get through low doorways?). Great for the grownup collector/completist and any kid who likes to play ""Senate Negotiations!"" Not a lot of action, but a nice figure."
3,Why don't they sell out?,Have you noticed when you go to a store that there are still Star Wars Episode II action figures still around? They are almost the worst pegwarmers (term means figures that don't get sold I've seen!!!That Mace Windu Arena Escape for instance.My Target still has dozens of him and I'm not kidding!People must hate him or something including me!(I bought the deluxe Mace Windu.)Darth and Luke dual figures can be found still everywhere!Almost TWO YEARS!THEY DON'T GO?Big Problem here.Lord of the Rings figures don't seem to have that problem.They sell out quick!(except maybe climbing Smeagol)So buy these old figures so we can be rid of them cluttering stores.Amazon at least has sold many of theres at least.Buy this guy today and lets clear the path for growth and freedom!!!!
2,Bustier Bra by Va Bien,"My only suggestion to anyone looking to purchase this bra is know your measurements and how to convert them. I followed the online measurement guidelines and when I received the bra it was too large. In addition, the garters which were to accompany the order were not included. I opened and searched the package thoroughly for them. Alas, I ended up returning the bra, although I had hoped it was just what I needed for my upcoming wedding. Very disappointed."
5,Amazing!,"I purchased this bustier to wear under my wedding dress and I couldn't be happier. I usually wear a 34C so I ordered that size and it fits like a glove. It gives the perfect amount of lift withough being filled with padding. Also it comes down low enough on your waist so that you don't get any buldge. If you're thinking about purchasing, just do it. It is amazing!"
5,Last Dance,"This book was well written and spellbinding, I want to read more books in the series. I really enjoyed it."
4,fast easy read,This is book 2 in the series follows right behind the first bookNice easy weekend read keeps your intrest complete story but also builds the back story
3,Continues...,"I can see improvements in this series--for one, there was actually a part of the whole mystery that I didn't see coming. Everything until this point has just been so obvious and fairly cheesy, but this book offered a few good surprises.I don't like how the main character labels Opal as being ""bossy"", even after all she's done as a spirit guide. I hope it changes in later series.A decent story, mostly. I will continue reading."
1,she's still got it . . .,"originally, when i read linda joy sigleton's 'don't die, dragonfly', i assumed the sequel would be fairly corny, the end of 'don't die, dragonfly' made it seem so.but 'last dance' was, in my opinion, even better then the first book. singleton adds up even more drama and tension that before, and adds even more well-developed (even if predictable) dilema's to sabine rose.one part, well actually two, did seem a bit odd: that no one had ever heard of the 'chloe day' before, and how fast sabine recieved one of the charms towards the end. but, that beside, the book was definitely worth reading, and i can't wait for the sequel."
4,Very nice shoes but not that comfortable for someone with wide feet,"These shoes are absolutely gorgeous to look at and looks good on. However, I haven't really gotten a chance to wear it much since it bunches my toes together. I have wide feet so that might be something to consider for someone with wide feet. After walking around for a while, my feet really hurt in this."
3,OK while it lasted,"I bought three of these pens. Yellow, Black and Red. They are plastic but write very well. The only problem I have is that the back screws on and loosens. My pen keep opening up and falling apart. I now have a pen that I can no longer use because I have lost the back in of it. Even though its a $30 fountain pen the quality could be better."
2,Recruiting 2000,"I read the Recruiting 2000 guide and was dissappointed. While it gave information regarding recruiting, the information was just too basic. It is definitely over priced at 29.95."
2,A Disappointment,"Although the information that was provided was helpful, the quality and content of the book does not warrant the fact that it is grossly overpriced."
4,Murder in Belleville,"In Murder in Belleville, the author skillfully introduces the colorful but little known section of Paris. As in Marais, readersare offered real time experience of Paris with its smell, sound and vision. It is a rare skill to bring the setting come to lifeso vividly. Apparently, author has researched in depth on North African immigrant's experience in France. The plot is bit complicated but readers are rewarded with spine-tingling suspense throughout."
1,Disappointingly bad...,"This seems to be a successful series, so I had high hopes. Who wouldn't want to read a good mystery that takes place in Paris? What a disappointment. To begin with, the author's basic sentence structure and grammar leave something to be desired. More than that, the plot is almost incomprehensible. I continued reading until, about 3/4 of the way through, I decided that whatever happened in the end, the novel could not be redeemed."
1,"Tedious, implausible, and wooden","I forced myself to finish this book, though it was touch and go in several places, just so I could feel able to review it fairly. It seems I liked it even less than reviewer Ms. Trieste ""CF"", below, but I am in general agreement with her points. There are just so many things wrong with this book that even the grating ""famous names"" don't really stand out for me. Let's see, where to begin: the naive political ranting, the unspeakable dialogue, the corny love interest, the wholly implausible technology, the absurd coincidences, the distractingly disjointed structure, the proliferation of minor characters, the talky explanations of the detective's thought processes, the total incompetence and corruption of the police - I can't go on; it's hackneyed and poorly written, and that's all there is to it."
3,A Nice Look Back...but Incomplete,"As a former resident of Poughkeepsie, NY, I was looking foward to this publication. The quality of the book itself and it's printing are all very high grade. Nice smooth cover and the archival photos are great.The information inside is complete and well-documented. However, it only details the first 50 years of the 20th Century. If someone grew up there during the 1930s - 50s, it will bring back a lot of memories. However, if you lived there from the 1960s onward, I felt it left a lot out. Yes, it shows a couple photos of the renovation of downtown and road expansion during that period, but thats about it. I remember Poughkeepsie during the 1960s and how vibrant it was and all the change it went thru as the area struggled with urbanization. But there are so few crumbs of information and few photographs of the era.So if you came from that area before the 1960s, you'll enjoy looking back. If you lived there later, let your mind remember the days."
5,POWERFUL BLAST FROM THE PAST,"I loved this album when it came out, and I love it even more nearly thirty years later. It is a good-rockin', tour de force by a bunch of English guys with political points to make. The lyrics are good, and at times dark and foreboding, but they bring out the turbulence of Great Britain in the late 70s. The propulsive power of politicized songs like ""Long Hot Summer"", ""Winter of '79"" and ""Better Decide Which Side Your're On"" is matched by the hard-drivin' rockers like ""Grey Cortina"" and ""2-4-6-8 Motorway"" (a big hit in England in early '78)."
1,Broke in two after a year. Don't buy!,"I would have rated this item 0 stars, if that were an option. We discovered approximately a year after installing these that the plastic strap had become so brittle that it snapped in two with little manipulation. Fortunately, we discovered this because we were moving, not because a piece of furniture fell. I shudder to think what might have happened if our furniture had tipped."
1,"Don't trust them, they're crap","These straps are horrible. The screws are so cheap and crappy that they strip if you so much as think about them encountering any resistance while screwing them in, and twice when screws actually encountered resistance, the screwheads popped off! How's THAT safe? The screw heads are what holds the brackets to the wall or furniture!I highly recommend that Furniture Wall Straps by Safety First instead. We have tried several brands and those are by FAR the best. They are easy to install, appear ot be sturdy, and also easy to remove temporarily if you need to move the furniture to reach behind it."
1,Cheaply made,"The screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately --- was about to use my own, then read the review below and decided I'd be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall . . ."
1,They break on their own!,"Unless they have started making the strap out of a different material, DON'T rely on this to keep your furniture from tipping!. I know that there is better plastic available, so I don't know why they don't use a another type that doesn't get brittle over a couple of years.All I can think of is PROFITS. That's why it is made so cheaply. If you already have this product, try replacing the strap with the heavy-duty zip-ties that you buy at the hardware store -- they come in a package of 20-50 or so and you can cut them and replace them whenever you need to move the furniture."
4,"Convenient and easy to install, if you don't strip the screw","I have used this anti-tip device for over 4 years. My zip ties have not become brittle. I have moved to a different home and reinstalled the wall brackets. I very rarely move the furniture for cleaning or other issues, but I like the flexibility."
3,They are OK.,"These are ok, but my son used L-brackets as they were more safe. I think they would be alright for the person who is not good at installing other means of secure brackets."
3,Bracket review,"We were pleased to find this product on line as we were not able to find anything locally to secure our bookcases. The bands and brackets work exactly as we had hoped. However like many of the other customers noted the screws are inferior. We purchased this product regardless and tried using the supplied screws. The heads stripped right away. Do yourself a favor and buy screws from your hardware store before starting the project. You'll save yourself time and frustration. With all this said, once again, the product works as promised. The only reason for three stars is the screw problem."
4,"Good product, needed longer ties","The brackets worked great but for some of the furniture I was using these on, combined with a chair rail being in the way, I had to buy longer zip ties at the store and use those. To me that was no big deal and the furniture stays safely in place."
2,not strong enough,"We used these with our first child and I had no complaints, BUT she was not a climber and when we went to move and remove the straps, they were so brittle that they fell apart in my hands. Had my daughter ever tried to climb the furniture, the straps would have surely given way and allowed the furniture to fall over on top of her. This was 4 years after installation, so I can't say at what point they were no longer reliable, hence the 2 stars...they did at least work in the beginning.Needless to say, I'm going with the fabric strap version with my second child who climbs everything."
2,Screwed,"I was disappointed in the quality of this product. The straps themselves are nothing special and the included screws are very poor quality. In one case the screw head was stamped off center, making it unusable. As indicated by other reviewers, it is pretty much impossible to use these screws without stripping them, even if you use a hand screwdriver and a pre-drilled hole. I ended up having to use some leftover drywall screws, which fit through the opening in the brackets almost perfectly.Since you will have to replace the screws, you are better off just purchasing the brackets and your own zip ties."
2,Screws are terrible,"My husband says the screws that came with this product are the worst he's ever dealt with. They don't go in straight and they strip. He had to go to the hardware store for replacement screws in order to install the brackets. Other than that, the brackets and zip ties seem fine."
5,Interesting product,"This item is basically a tougher version of those sip tie holders with the sticky backs. instead of sticky backs, you get two screws to screw the item into a wall. These work GREAT! For optimum safety, be sure to screw these into studs. Where studs aren't available, make sure to get yourself some good anchors. This has helped keep a shelving unit and a light fixture in place. My niece has tested these and she can tell you they hold items well. Just a note, be sure that the item you want to secure can either have screws screwed into it or has some kind of bar the zip ties can hold onto. Otherwise, this may not be the product for you. Quakehold makes a couple of Velcro based items that may help in situations described above."
5,This a cappella group really knows their stuff!,"This group formed in Stockholm, Sweden, has some of the best vocal jazz stuff around! I really like this cd because of the variety of styles showcased. You won't be able to tell that the music was recorded live. I have seen this group perform and they are really tight!"
1,contractor's plastic,Very very flimsy - same feel as a shrink wrap. Don't buy; I ended up returning mine.
5,Great for camping!,"I use this storage bag for hauling our dog's food when camping. I prefer this bag over a solid container, as it is much easier to pack. It keeps the food dry and bug free."
2,Blade broke on second use!,"I bought two of these. They seemed well made, but my son complained that the blades broke on both, after only the second use. He was cutting crown molding, so I'm not sure if they were designed for lighter usage, or what. In any case, we have two handles, no blades ... since it didn't seem cost-effective to buy blades which only perform two cuts before snapping!"
5,Very Peaceful Music,"In the first place, I am partial to liturgical music, and secondly, it is hard to get stressed over going to work with this playing on your CD player. Worth the money."
2,Long and Boring,"I thought the point of this book was interesting but very badly written, the only reason I got until the end was because I wanted to know how it will end. I was disappointed. This is an over 100-page-book written about something that happened in 20 minutes. If you like reading yourself too sleep this book is perfect for you."
1,"Amy Bradshaw, Teacher","As an educator I can see some value in this book, however, it is not one that I will be recommending to my students. Trent is an interrogator who is good - too good - at what he does. Jason is a slightly less than typical 12 year old who is asked to ""help"" him with a murder investigation. What happened when these two came together made me want to scream!!I don't think this book is realistic. Yes, I realize it is fiction but, it is suppose to be realistic fiction. As far as I'm concerned it could be fantacy. I read many young adult books so that I can keep up with good literature to recommend to my students. I would not consider this good literature - fair maybe."
3,TINA'S REVIEW,"I liked the book only because it was realistic. I absolutely hated the ending. This book was the first I read by Robert Cormier ; I don't think it will be my last. It was worth reading and I think you will think the same about it!There is a boy named Jason and one day he goes over his friends house, Alicia and she is a wiz at jigsaw puzzles. In the same day she is murdered. Hit in the head with a heavy, hard object. Only hit once hard enough the she died. She was placed under branches and leaves. She was placed very neatly and carefully. When Jason was questioned they brought in a professional named Trent. He finds out who did it and makes everyone around him convinced. Convinced of what you say, read to find out!I think a reader who is use to this style of writing will enjoy this book. If a regular reader reads this book they will be disturbed....Enjoy"
5,READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!,"If you like mystery then this book is for you. This Book is by far one of the best books that I have read in a while. I would suggest that you read this book and tell other people about it. Here is the basic laydown of the book: There is this kid named Jason who lives across the street from this girl named Alicia who gets murdered just minutes after Jason had left her house, now the police think that he could be a possible suspect on the killings of this girl. Does Jason end up guilty or does it remain a mystery? You will have to read the book and find out(don't want to spoil the end for you)!!!!!!!"
3,Unrealistic Ending,"Having read two other great Cormier books in the past: The Chocolate War and I Am the Cheese, I had big expectations for this posthumous novel. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed.Most of the book is actually quite good, and very thought-provoking. The characters are three-dimensional, and you really get into their minds, and the motivations behind their actions are clear. However, the ending is a complete letdown and totally unbelievable. I don't want to give too much away, but Cormier seems to discard all thought of character and intention just to give his reader a shocking surprise ending.[. . .]So, all-in-all, I'm glad I read the book, but I think its ending is fatally flawed. If you want to read a good Cormier novel, go pick up The Chocolate War instead. It's plot is supremely fine-tuned, and there's much more emotional investment in it, too."
3,An Interesting One,"This book to me displayed the torments that one person can feel over one's job. It showed that as they say in the book' ""you are your work"". I feel that this book deals with the emotional crises that Trent deals with in his line of work. It shows how far one person will go to make a name for himself and what it does to the little boy. I thought that the book was good in the fact of the mystery and all. I have read one other book of Robert Cormier's, Tenderness, which I thought to be an exciting thriller. This book is interesting and i would want my friends to read it."
2,The Rag and Bone Shop,"I purchased this book for my 10 year old, who was assigned to do a book report on a mystery. I found the book at Amazon in the Children aged 9-12 category. When the book arrived, my daughter noticed the book jacket suggested this book was for ages 12+, and asked me to pre-read it for her. I am so glad that I did. While the book is not particularly difficult (no advanced words), the subject matter is extremely mature and definitely inappropriate for a 10 year old. The book is provocative -- for an older child -- aged 12+."
1,the rag and the bone shop,A way to short book that bores and deppresses even though that the book probably wasn't meant to make the reader burn the book!!!
4,Cormier's last magic,"This novel is not very long, but so sadistic that I couldn't help reading through it in one sitting. In other words, I wanted to finish and forget the horrible novel as soon as possible.@There, the police summoned a very able interrogator to make a murderer of a schoolgirl out of an innocent boy. The interrogator was convinced that the boy was innocent. But his pride and desire for promotion prevented him from stopping his persistent interrogation. At last, the boy....@About half the novel was the interrogation scene. It almost made me sick. But I couldn't throw away the book. It's Cormier's last magic."
4,Quick read for reluctant readers,"A quick read for reluctant readers, probably boys especially. Gives the readers a good chance to talk about adult-child relations in terms of power. Also a chance to explore the impact of the justice system on a simplistic level. I read the book in one day. Anyone looking for a deep, thinking-type book will be disappointed; this book is one for kids. (12-14)."
3,A rapid reading,"This book is easy to read, and not boring, I hope to read some other books by the author"
5,The Rag and Bone Shop,"I purchased a class set of this novel for my freshmen class. The enthusiasm for it was overwhelming and although it is a tragic topic, the resolution was appropriate for this age level. It is an easy read and allowed for most reading levels. Vocabulary is fairly basic and the concepts were clear. I highly recommend it as an independent reading book which can also be easily summarized and critiqued by the students"
2,Bad Ending,"When I saw this book, I was very interested in reading it. The plot sounded interesting and I couldn't wait to see the outcome. Jason is a 12 year old boy who is accused of murdering Alicia, the 7 year old sister of one of Jason's ""friends"". Trent is the interrogator hired to interrogate Jason and make him confess murdering Alicia. I read this book in one day for the same reason I decided to read the book: to see the outcome. It wasn't the most exciting book to read and I found myself confused during Trent and Jason's conversations, but overall it was okay. When I got to the ending, I have to say I hated it. I absolutely hated it. I won't say any more, but this book is not one I would read again. However, I do think it is a worthwhile read for people over 13 due to most of the context within the book. This book is gory at times and for mature readers. Overall, The Rag and Bone Shop was an okay read, but definitely not one of my favorites."
5,The Rag and Bone Shop Review by Stacy,"In The Rag and Bone Shop, written by Robert Cormier, 13-year-old boy Jason is a suspect of a murdered little girl. A successful detective, Trent, interrogates Jason. This transcendent book has a way to make the reader push farther into the book. The Rage and Bone Shop was so interesting that I cannot wait to read another book by Mr. Cormier.My reaction after finishing The Rag and Bone Shop was, ""How did that happen? I can't believe that happened!"" The most interesting thing about this book has to be that you have the ability to get inside all of the characters' heads. I think that is a wonderful way of writing. This ending will surprise readers. I think the book would interest all sorts of people who are into detective shows."
4,Nice design,"Good quality glasses. Original design. Arrived well producted in the box. After using for 2 months, I am very happy with them"
5,Approved by a Sommelier,"When I went to become an Italian Wine Specialist they gave me two of these to taste wines with during the course and as parting gifts. So I decided to buy this set of 4 as a gift for a friend.If you don't want to have 5 different shapes, styles, and sizes of wine glasses this one glass will do it all.Shaped nicely infused with Titanium (or some other metal) to make them extra strong while making them thin.Nice shape that tapers at the top to conentrate the bouquet.Dishwasher safe almost indestrucible. Although I broke one of them in the diswaher last night :(Even if you drink a $10 bottle of wine you need some decent stemware, Every household should have four to eight of these bad boys.I am planning to buy a 24 pack for my tasting events as soon as I save some dineros. Again worls well with 2 ounces tasting and regular 5-6 ounce pours. Woks with red and whites and any varietal."
1,stanley Mud pan,"Great mud pan, The rounded bottom is tops for getting all the mud out and its easy to clean. Is a bit tippy when full, just put it on level surface always. The rounded bottom is real easy to get ahold of also."
5,Satisfactory conclusion to McCaffertys Series,"Lisa Jackson wound this series up with great heart and a solid storyline. As always, there is a tinge of sadness that the series is over, but she left the door open to future continuation in the McCaffery saga. Kudos and well-done."
3,An okay short read,"I love Lisa Jacksons's suspense books, and decided to take a chance on the McCafferty series. All of the books are short and thusly the characters and stories are supremely underdeveloped. Having said that the first three I enjoyed as a short quick read. I believe that Randi is the weak link in the series. It was predictable and the characters flip flopped all around. It was an okay short read."
4,The McCaffertys: Randi,"Good story, Randi is a strong woman, loves her child. She doesn't always make the right decisions about men. Her brothers are overbearing and very protective. Good ending for the final book in The McCafferty series. I like most all of Lisa Jackson's books."
3,Randy [book],This was a great book . I read all three of this seiris.It Came wall wrapped and was not damaged.
5,a real gentle bleach product!,"This is truly a great product. Compared to any other brand,it covers and masks hair making it lighter. so even if a person is sitting close to you he/she wont notice because it wont turn the hair yellow, but transparent! Its effect lasts longer than other brands. you will need to bleach once per month! less if you have already light hair. If you are looking for THE hair bleach product Andrea is the only one i can suggest."
1,Review on Gentle Creme Bleach For Face,"I was a little disappointed with this product as the application did not turn out as I expected. Am not sure if this is suitable for Asian skin but my face felt very irritated and little bubbles even surface after I wash it off. I tried a couple of times but the result is always the same. Hence, it did not solve and help my problem."
3,Gentle,This product is very gentle almost to gentle i have very sensitive skin and it does not hurt at all. However that being said it is ok for already light hair but after 5 treatments to the same area over a week most hairs are very light but very dark ones are not getting lighter at all.
3,Sensitive Ears,I have very small ear openings and most earbuds hurt my ears. These are very comfortable. I can wear them for long periods of time and the sound is very good.
2,Falls out,"They are cute and fun, and they put out a good sound, but they don't stay in! I actually liked my previous pair of JVC headphones which were just hard plastic and didn't have the marshmallow. I never had a problem with those or the normal ipod style headphones falling out. But when I broke them and had to get replacements, I decided to try these marshmallow ones everyone raves about. Wish I hadn't! I was on the treadmill (just walking- not even running fast) and had to adjust these just about every minute. I follow the directions perfectly (squish the tip, put it in your ear and let expand). My roommate has the same ones and says they don't stay in for her either."
4,Nice compromise between price and quality,"I got these to replace my original apple earbuds, which I found to be extremely uncomfortable. These have a sound fairly close to the apple ones, but are much more comfortable, and actually fit my ears. I wanted something that sounded decent, and wouldn't cost a fortune - these fit that criteria for me. True audiophiles probably don't find these to be all that great, but for the average listener I think they work just fine. They do also come with 2 sizes of earbud covers to help customize the fit. The smaller of the 2 is already on the earbuds (at least mine were). Overall I find them to be a good buy."
2,Same old ear buds,"I have to say that I was disappointed after reading some of the great reviews about these ear bud headphones. I wanted a pair to wear while riding on the back of a motorcycle. Needless to say they would not work. Everytime I felt like I had them in my ears, one would fall out. I decided to try them at the gym while working out on the elliptical machine. Again very disappointed... They would not stay put. I finally found a pair which wrap around the ear and the ear bud fits firmly into the ear. I have had no problems since. I'm sorry to say that I would not urge anyone to buy these. I love the color but it's not worth it!!!"
2,Hmm...,"Well, I bought these just for the colour, but I can't use them! The headphone plush part will fit in my parents ears, but mine are too small! Even when I managed to get them in, the sound wasn't all that great. Plus, they seem a lot less durable than the normal i-Pod headphones. In my opinion, just stick with those white ones!"
1,Quit on me after a few days,I bought these because of the good reviews so when the price went down I ordered them. I could not get these to be comfortable; they would fall out of my ears. The point's moot now; after only using them a few days they started cutting out on me; I tried other earphones and they were fine so it was not my player. :-(
4,Nice headphones.,These are nice headphones. They are comfortable and easy to use. My only complaint is when I am running on the treadmill they tend to fall out of my ears. Otherwise very good product.
2,JVC EARPHONES,"JVC HAFX33P Marshmallow In-Ear Stereo Headphone (Pink)Not what I expected. I wanted in-ear stereo earphones for the comfort and sound. I don't like head-phones very much. My head phones have superior sound and these ear-phones do not compare. I will use them for the comfort (when needed), but will revert to my head-phones when I am really interested in listening to superior sounding music. So, if you are looking for comfort with just regular stereo sound...then go for it. They are very comfortable and a reasonable price for just that feature. You get what you pay for and the price for this is not much of a loss, but does not change the disapointment for wanting good sound as well"
5,wasted 99. on the previous ones...these damn near close!,"My second of 3 ipods (first flew off the bike at 80mph, second stolen from tow truck by driver when bike was towed home...third destroyed by cockatoo....)was when it became apparent I was going to spend money to replace earbuds. My demands for quality sound are notoriously linked to my complaining about and subsequently throwing away crappy quality. I use the pink marshmallows cuz Im girly and pink..but I KEEP using them because they are as good or damn near as good as the high priced ones...especially if your not willing to spend a hundred bucks while your waiting for the next unfortunate death of your current ipod. Great product..looks good too..[...]"
1,Uncomfortable and Too Big,"I bought these and exchanged them, there was no way they would stay in my ear, they were way too big even when I switched out the ear pieces to the small ones. I couldn't get them in much less to stay in so I'd definatly have to say they aren't for people who don't have huge deep ears or for people who want them to use to work out."
1,Cute but uncomfortable!,"Our dog had eaten 2 pairs of headphones, so I purchased these for 1 of the replacement pairs. Since they were JVC and relatively inexpensive, and they looked comfy, I went ahead and got these for my daughter mostly because they're pink. Even using the smaller set of ""marshmallows,"" these are uncomfortably large for me (and they don't even come close to fitting my daughter). Add to that the ""ick factor"" of having to squish & roll the ""marshmallows"" (much like sound proofing ear plugs) before insertion and these are definitely not the earphones for us... Wish I could recommend something better, but we're still looking!"
3,Relavent thermodynamic models in a nutshell,"This book neatly summarises important thermodynamic models relavent to Gibbs energy, Phase behaviour and in particular Electrolyte and Polymer solutions on which there is litte literature available. The chapter on Group Contribution methods serves the need of even practising engineers, who often face problems in either retrieving or estimating physical properties."
2,The Editors Should Be Fired,"Although Syngress apparently employed a Technical Editor (Jeffrey Posluns) and a Copy Editor (Judy Eby) in preparing this book, it's riddled with both technical and grammatical errors. For experienced email server administrators, Inside the Spam Cartel is an almost complete waste of time. Novices would learn a great deal from this book, but much of what they learned would be wrong. (For example, on p. 183 the author claims that a public key allows one to decrypt a message encrypted using PGP. Or take this discussion of BGP, from p. 64: ""Each BGP router is given an Autonomous System (AS) number and each AS is unique and directly identifies the router by name."")"
5,on time delivery,"item was on time and in satisfied condition as i was asking for a so-so used book, great service!"
2,A Little Literature Review,"I believe that, Bell Tower Books misrepresented the condition of ""A Little Literature"" that I bought and received. Many pages of the book were heavily annotated. I feel I should have been informed and given an accurate condition of the merchandise before I purchased the book. For this reason, I have decided that I will not purchase anything else from Bell Tower Books because I am extremely dissatisfied with this order."
3,Hammertime,"These earrings did not look anything like the picture and I was disappointed, but I will keep them anyway."
3,Bruce Johnston steps out...,"Bruce Johnston, who joined the Beach Boys in 1965 (he can be heard singing on ""California Girls"" and the Beach Boys ""Pet Sounds"" album) released this solo album in 1977, and it has some interest for Beach Boys fans. It contains updated covers of two songs: ""Disney Girls"" and ""Dierdre"" which the Beach Boys included on a couple of their early 70's albums, as well as his own version of his hit composition for Barry Manilow ""I Write The Songs"" (reportedly written as a tribute to Brian Wilson). Not a must-have album, but interesting for Beach Boys fans, and a pleasant, inconsequential outing. The complete track listing: 1. I Write the Songs 2. Deidre 3. Thank You Baby 4. Rendezvous 5. Won't Somebody Dance with Me 6. Disney Girls 7.Rock and Roll Survivor 8. Don't Be Scared 9. Pipeline."
3,"Great vocals, uneven effort","I am a big BB fan. I am also a fan of Bruce & Terry as well as the late Terry Melchers 2 wonderful solo albums (check out Bruce on both of these as well as the first Roger McGuinn solo lp). I owned this when it came out on vinyl and am glad to have a clean CD copy. The material is uneven (Won't Someone Dance with Me is just too sugary even for my overly-sweet preferences).However, I consider the vocals outstanding across the board. Bruce has a superb voice for both lead and background. I think Rock & Roll Survivor is the standout track on here. Unlike the other reviewers, I think the sparse production suits the material. I could do without the disco Pipeline.The album is short on running time. But I stll regularly play and enjoy what is there. If you can find it, also check out Bruce (and Terry and Brian and Curt Boettcher) on the California Music 45s. Each is a gem."
1,Don't waste your time,"I have read a couple book by Linda Lael Miller and absolutely loved her books, however this book fell far from the mark. The main characters have no depth, and no connection. They just rush into different events without giving an explanation as to why things happened. The guy treats the woman horribly and the female lead flies off the handle anytime someone talks to her. Nothing the guy says is right, not to mention shes dumber than a doornail.Don't read it. Obviously not one of Linda Lael Millers best works."
4,Lobel Bros. Meat Cookbook,"Had this in paperback, got it in hardback, used. A great book that covers all meats and some game. Very useful."
5,Radical,I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. It is just as described and came with a little card about the story of the charm. So cute. He hasn't take. It off since I have it to him! Thanks!!
4,Book arrived in good shape and very quickly,"I have not read the book, I purchased it as a stocking stuffer for my daughter. (She had it on her wish list.) We did a lot of our shopping for Christmas this year on Amazon, and it was a pleasure to do so.The book arrived in good shape, quickly, for a good/great price and no hassles with traffic to go to the store."
1,"Many additives, dyes and biblical quotes on package","I wanted a nice clean simple snack. What I received was pork rinds adulterated with MSG, several food dyes, Hydrongenated soybeen oil MSG and sugar. To put salt in the wound they plaster biblical quotes about Jesus on the package! They can do without this Buddhist's business! Total waste."
1,I gues Park Rinds aren't my thing,I was trying to find a salty snack that was low/zero carbs and Pork Rinds aren't available around the east coast. Ordered this selection and can't say a good thing about it. The chips are heavy and chewy and feel like lumps of lard in your mouth as you eat. The flavors a mild and can't do a thing to help the nasty texture. The whole box is in my attic right now until I decide to throw it away.
3,Only like two of the flavors,"Only 2 good flavors, the BBQ one and Sweet Soemthing (I can't remember). The others are all too salty (and I like salty), so these were SUPER sandpaper tounge salty. Finished all the pork rinds pretty much only because they were there and I didnt want to waste them. Since you can't buy individual flavors, this product is beat, don't waste your time just hit up 7-11 or a grocery store and get what's there, it will be cheeper and better."
4,Interesting and difficult but good,"This book explores the narrator's mother's death - the second half being narrated by the dead mother. Interspered between the narrative segments are quotations from a wide variety of literary sources. In the narrative segments, especially those of the mother, dreams and ""reality"" are intertwined. The book deserves multiple readings to fully appreciate its content but is certainly enjoyable as a single read.Note: since there is no description of the book this is translated from Hungarian and is part of a larger work."
3,Sounds Effects Iffy,About time they released the entire series as one collection! My major complaint is that the sound effects seem to have been completely redone to get that 5.1 sound everyone wants.Many of the explosions now sound like fireworks?!?Surely HG/ADV could have used more from the Japanese tracks or at least put some real effort into the sound.
5,Best Series Ever!!!,"Many years ago Robotech was shown in my country as regular TV series, however, due to its grown up, complex story and violent scenes, most of its story was cut and you could hardly understand the story, fine for a 5 year old but not for more hardcore fans like myself. When I saw the protoculture collection I was speechless, I could not believe that my most beloved anime series of all time was at the grasp of my hand and I was not dissapointed!!, not only was I able to see the entire story as it was intended to be but the dvds are packaged beautifully, each season on its separate box with index. The dvds pretty much follow the same format, but they have been digitally remastered, the soundtrack is perfect and you can choose between english and/or spanish for language (if you can choose english as the spanish translations is a little bit off sometimes). Overall a great product, a great purchase, the most awesome anime series ever!"
5,Exactly what I was looking for...,"... Every episode, uncut. Enough extras to keep you going all in one good looking box. Great sound! Fantastic color!20 years later, This series still gets me excited. Only now I have my own child to share it with."
4,It all good,I remember watching this from way back and was happy to find it..I'm not really good at doing Reviews but I tell you this buy it watch it love it...I did and fell in love with it all over again it was nice to remember parts that i did forget it like getting to know old friends after they move away and now they back Sit up with your kids and let the see what a good written show is all about...
3,Why change anything?,"I'd give this collection 5 stars, but for some insane reason they decided to change many of the mecha sound effects from the originals when they redid the sound, so now instead of the old school, sometimes strange, sounds I grew up with stuff has crappy half hearted ""modern"" sound effects. I just can't figure out what reason they would have to screw up the original sound other then pure lazyness. If you are a true diehard try waiting a bit longer and maybe they will release a even newer version with the original sound effects redone in Dolby 5.1 or higher."
3,O2B shopping around,"RE: review > yeah... what everyone else said... RE: shopping...For anyone who has not really been looking around for this DVD set, I passed by the local Best Buy and found the same item for $83.99. To make the buying experience more fun, I received a gift certificate from a friend of mine during the holidays making this purchase a $63.99 + tx experience. Thanks Amy... Think I may have located my lost childhood after all these years. > NR"
2,"Don't waste your time, get the original anime version","Robotech was good, but really confusing the way it combined completely three separate anime into one story! Add on that when you first watch it, you probably didn't even realize that ...Save yourself some head scratching and horrible plot modification to make the three series ""fit"". Get the original anime series subbed/dubbed instead!Or go find newer Macross titles like Macross Zero or Macross Frontier! (sadly only available as an import from Japan for now). Hopefully the legal issues with Harmony Gold claiming to own all Macross distribution internationally will be resolved so Macross Zero and Frontier will see US & European release!"
1,Changed opening credits (bad),"I LOVE Robotech. I grew up with it. I am not bothered by the number of releases like others, but in this case, I am deeply disappointed with the huge change to the series: the credits. Originally, the 3 series' openings and closings were edited together quite nicely-timed well with the music. In this case, the openings feature footage only from the current generation (macross, southern cross, new generation). BAD. And the titles, the credits are annoying. They blur and scale in and out. They tried to keep everything in motion, but instead it is bothersome. The moving text with the highly animated backdrop does not work well at all. And lastly, the outside box art is pretty good with Rick and Scott, but the inner art is scarce and unexciting. Otherwise, the show looks and sounds great. I just can't get over the opening and closing credits."
2,Changed sound effects mar an otherwise good set,"As a long time fan, really looked forward to popping this collection in the player. While it certainly is complete, the redone sound effects are so distractingly generic and poorly done (why do all space ships sound just like jet fighters?), my experience was ruined. I found myself looking forward to the dialogue just so I wouldn't have to hear them.Huge disappointment."
5,finlly the awaited edition,"A definitive must have collection for Robotech lifetime fans.beautifully remastered, plus an extra DVD filled with collectors curiosities to enjoy.This edition worth every penny"
3,Bootleg Copy?,"The genuine ROBOTECH Protoculture Collection sets are supposed to come with 21 DVD in them! The one I reeived only had 18! You can see in the picture that the EX (extras) section is supposed to be the biggest one, having 7 discs in it. The one I received only had 4 extras discs."
4,Japanimation,"Good space combat cartoon. Portrays many realities of friendships, government ideas, military wins and loses, etc, etc, that children and adults can enjoy the series."
4,Everything is great but casing.,"Everything fine, but the case is too weak... It's marked easily.About the extra content it's far more than I thought, it's incredible to have the movie along with all the series but interviews are boring."
5,Awesome stylistic artistic bliss!,you've never done Robotech?? It's simply awesome! Jump in today!Trust me! This is what got me into so many other things in life.... a true experience!
5,I'm loosing sleep getting through this...,"Like many, I watched Robotech after school in the late 80's. I remember it as being a little more serious than the other cartoons I was used to. So naturally, I picked up this box set as a way to recapture my youth. It is just as fun to watch as an adult - although there are many snickers that were probably deep moments for my pre-teen self. I am catching some of the recycled graphics sequences that I missed as a kid. Overall, I find the collection completely addictive and find my bedtime getting later and later as I push for ""just one more"".From the non-collector/fanatic perspective, I can't complain about the quality, packaging, new title sequence (theme music survived and that is what I remember), etc. It is just good fun."
5,Port is fine,"Love the Game. Iam very familar with this product. I have played this game for over a year, through VA hospital."
3,Not one of Eric Tyson's better efforts,"As an investment professional and self-confessed do-it-yourselfer, I am a great fan of Eric Tyson's ""Personal Finance for Dummies"" and ""Mutual Funds for Dummies"" which empower people to manage their own finances better. It was therefore very disappointing for me to read this book and ""Home Buying for Dummies"", only to find that the authors (maybe through Ray Brown's influence)pound away relentlessly at the notion that the reader REALLY should hire a real estate agent rather than doing it themself. The authors clearly have a much higher opinion of real estate brokers and agents than I do.Anyone looking for a reference on how to figure out the finances of buying and selling homes and how to effectively choose and use a real estate agent will likely find these books useful.Unfortunately, the ""do-it-yourself"" crowd needs to look elsewhere or hope for a major revision."
3,"Not for ""FISBO""s.","This book discourages ""FISBO's"" (For Sale By Owner) types in favor of hiring a real estate agent. In fact, only one chapter deals with this. I'd recommend this book to those who plan to hire an agency to sell their home. It will inform them of the various machinations of the sales process. For those looking to sell their own property, I recommend ""The For Sale By Owner Kit"" by Robert Irwin. It's directed soley at the ""FISBO"" person."
5,Absolutely practical,"With no other experience than this book and its sister 'House Buying for Dummies' I have done 3 transactions over the last two years. I used them as overviews, instruction manuals and reference guides. Covers the basics in straight forward language, and also goes into sufficient detail to not require buying another books. Don't be fooled or ashamed of the title. There is nothing but intelligence in this book."
3,Average Read,"Eric Tyson is a great writer, and a wealth of information in his other books. This book, however, was very basic in it's approach to selling a home. Much of the information was the same as what could be found in an Internet search of the subject.It is an easy read, however, contains important information and is a good starting point for your research.For those trying to sell homes on their own, I recommendSell Your Home Without a BrokerorThe For Sale By Owner Kit.If you're looking for information on how to effectively market a home, do a short sale, or stage a home, I recommendHow to Sell Your Home in Any Market"
5,An essential book to your library,"I am an ardent fan of the authors of this book. I also bought House Buying for Dummies when I bought my house. This book takes you through the nuts and bolts of the House Selling process, without trying to sell you something. This book is very practical, and the authors have a unique ability of explaining how real estate works, without confusing you. I must say, after reading these books I have become an expert on the process, and feel very comfortable talking to RE professionals now without feeling like a ""Dummy"". Don't make the mistake of missing out on this essential reference."
2,A Novel Without a Hero,"Although the pacing of the story is excellent, and the descriptions of the court of Ancient Egypt easily places you there as well, I still couldn't get into the story. I put the blame on the characters inhabiting the novel. Not one was worth worrying over, and if you don't care about a character, you don't care what's happening to the character. All were unsympathtic, if not downright abbrasive or cold. Also, I guess I've got too much Puritanism in me, but all the incest going on put me off as well. True, the Egyptians of this time saw nothing wrong with it, but I did."
2,Three Days to Business Success,I just downloaded this. It is not much more than a (somewhat short) magazine article. I was disappointed. I thought that for over $5.00 I would be buying more.
5,An interesting departure into acoustic traditional songs.,"In the early 70's Horslips was an Irish entry into the field of rock which blended traditional jigs and reels with strong electric instrumentation. Stylistically close to Fairport Convention, the group blended hot licks with great Irish jigs, reels, and set dances. This album was a departure in that it focused exclusively on the traditional elements of their Celtic heritage. The selections featured the vocals of Barry Devlin, coupled with the fiddle of Charles O'Conner, blended with acoustic contributions from the remaining three band members. It is a distinct change of pace from other Horslips fare, and a good album for those into both rock and traditional celtic fare. On whole, the album plays like a fine winter night in a small village pub -- just the thing to warm the bones."
1,Mis-leading description,The link and the product description both state it as 'Sugar-Free'. I ordered and found out they really are 'No Sugar Added'. Very mis-leading...
4,Great Background,"This book provided an excellent series of insights into Koreans and their culture, exactly as the subtitle suggested. In many places I found myself nodding emphatically at the descriptions of Korean culture and personalities. I have passed this on to a friend interested in doing business in Korea, as I believe that it provides an excellent starting point.The only weakness I felt, was that I would have liked to have seen more on 'Where Their Future Lies'."
5,Excellent primer on South Korea,"Although written over a decade ago, ""The Koreans"" is a useful introduction to the people, culture, and politics of South Korea. Mr. Breen has written an excellent guide that has anecdotes that help illustrate who the Korean people are, but also a solid history of this dynamic country. It's a shame that most people seem to know more about north Korea than south Korea. This book can help you get up to speed!"
2,Not very good,I thought I should read a book about Korea to help my education about the country. But I didn't learn anything from this book that I can't see for myself. I need to get something better.
2,Biased...,"The problem with the book is that the author constantly compares Korea to the West. In his view, Koreans are inferior and backward people because they are still strongly attached to family values and often people's actions in Korea are determined based on those values. I wish the author (and people in the West in general) would realize that happiness and advancement do not come from individualistic pursuit of material gain and exploitation of others. I gave the book 2 stars because it has some information which was new to me. I wish facts would be presented as they are and not constantly compared and evaluated in the light of things in the West."
2,comic relief,"This book is laughable! My husband and I were cracking up over some of the passages. This book reads like a trashy tabloid. Just take a look at the title! In less than 250 pages (large type), Breen is going to explain not only who ""they"" are, but tell you what ""they"" want and on top of that, he's going to reveal to the reader where ""their"" future lies! Irrational nonsense."
4,Good but why no mention of previous Rev. Moon bio?,"The Koreans is a balanced reference work for people with a curiosity about modern Korea. It would probably make a good textbook for college students too. I lived in Pusan for one and a half years and there just aren't too many good books on Korea. The author's points are largely correct, but he sometimes exaggerates, maybe to support his case. Although the author's book jacket bio mentions that he used to write for the Unification Church-owned Washington Times, it makes no mention of his previously published biography of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's early years. I don't know if Breen himself is a member of the Unification Church but the full text of his Moon book is posted on the church's official website under the heading, ""Bibliography of Our Publications."" Regardless of the author's affiliations, The Koreans is a fair treatment about a country not many people know about."
4,As accurate as one man's observations can be,"This book is what it is -- a broad brushstroke of Korean society based on one man's experience. Breen's observations are insightful, entertaining and witty (as are all Englishmen?); however, at times he betrays a paternalistic attitude toward Korean society (as do all Englishmen?). This is not a scholarly book nor a history text (Hallelujah!), yet it provides a clear and concise account of Korean history. If you want a dissertation, go to a university. If you want a brief and readable introduction to Korean people, then start here. Just remember that stereotypes do not define everyone within a group, but often have an origin in truth."
3,Excellent analysis and insights,"Fourteen years after the publication of this book, Michael Breen is obviously still intrigued with Korea, and he still writes for a national newspaper there.His impressions and experience mirrors that of many expats in this essentially puzzling nation. He describes with upbeat humour the intense culture clash and the love-hate relationship most westerners feel towards the country, which remains a fascinating riddle to many. This is still one of the first books to recommend to anyone intending to visit or work in Korea.There has been a recent wave of popular exposes of this old land, that is new to the world stage. Of them, this is in my view the foreign author who understands this enigmatic people the best.Having said all that, this is a lightweight readers-digest, magazine-article type of book. Nothing too profound."
5,Essential for Doing Business with Korea,"As anyone who does business in Korea knows, understanding Korean culture is not only critically important, it is extremely difficult to achieve. Before reading this book, I would joke that I had a 25% understanding of Korean culture (this after more than ten years of handling legal matters there and of representing Korean companies in their legal matters outside Korea). About halfway through this book, I realized my understanding was really only at about 10%, but after reading it, I was back up to 25%. I have a number of Western friends who are fluent in Korean and have lived and worked there for many years. Without exception, their comments on this book are similar. They say that while not completely accurate (books like this do have a tendency to get out of date quickly), it is the best and the fastest way to get a decent understanding of Korean culture. For that reason, I heartily recommend this book."
1,I would recommend . . .,". . . that people NOT read this book. IF they do read it, I would advise them to realize that Michael Breen has a very shallow assessment of non western peoples and cultures. His writing, in it of itself, is solid and snappy, but his basic view of the Korean people is not that of a scholar or a true observant. I am not Korean and have only been to Japan, but as a student of Asian Studies, I found myself shaking my head on many pages, wondering how he can get away with such baseless insights. Were I to use the analogies or sweeping generalizations in a paper, or at a conference, I would get lambasted by anybody who had the gumption of what scholarly writing and argumentation is. I would recommend Bruce Cumings as a foriegn author who makes wonderful insights on Korean people and culture."
3,Good,I was hoping for a little bit better stories and they are a bit long. We read half a story and then the other half later. But we love mickey so we are pleased.
1,Painful both to read and have land on your foot,"It's absolute torture to read through this book. I can't even recommend one story in the collection. The book is only useful if you like Disney characters and want to remove the drawings out for display.Of course, your preschooler will want to read out of it...every night, for weeks, sometimes."
3,Durability???,"The design of the case is very nice in concept but failed in execution. Comparing the Isee nano with the agent 18, another clear polycarbonate case, the agent 18 feels more solid although it's not as clear/see through as the isee nano case. But the iSee nano comes with a belt clip, which is what attracted me in the first place since the agent 18 is a stand alone. The belt clip was flimsy and didn't keep the nano in place like the clip that Apple packaged with the Ipod Mini. Don't buy this for the flimsy clip, it won't last."
4,It's not work for Nano 2nd G,"I discovered that it's not suitable for Nano 2G because of it's round corners, but it's very good in it's pure plastic and it fine made."
4,"good case, it really is hard to open","I bought a different case first and it wasn't what i wanted so instead i bought this one, the contour design.I really like that is a clear hard case and that has an large opening at the bottom where the headphones go, i had bought the DLO one and i had to open the case to recharge the ipod which i find annoying. I also couldn't fit myh headphones in because the case was too think, so this design works well for me.I did open and close the case a number of times before putting in the ipod and still i can't get out the ipod, i just stopped trying, im sure if i need to ill be able to but the design is such that it isn't really necessary. just be sure that you are ready to put it in before you do so.I think the clip is okay, it would be nice if it could be attached both ways, but im glad that if it is only one way that they put it such that you can see the screen.i like my case, i now can slip the nano in my pocket and not have to worry about any scratches, etc."
1,NOT FOR THE NEW IPOD NANOS!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this for my wife's new nano, but the new nanos are not rounded on the corners like the older ones, so the new ones WILL NOT FIT in this case. I'll have to see if I can return it. I am surprised Amazon is still listing this item."
1,Did not fit product advertised,"This did not fit my Second generation ipod as advertised and I did not get any response about returning it, and of course I had to open the thing to find out it didn't fit."
5,Great album!,I bought this album in Spain based on the recommendation of the sales person in a cd store. What a positive surprise I had when I went back to the hotel and listened to the cd. This is an excellent album by a very talented Spanish band. I have since bought another of their albums. I highly recommend this album.
3,Very attractive but not accurate,"I am disappointed at the accuracy. I purchase two units and in a side by side comparison the humidity read 30% and 36%. The temperature was better, 71 and 70 degrees."
1,Don't waste your money,"This device never worked properly, even after changing the battery several times. The display kept fading out and the temperature reading was not correct. I had no way to check the humidity reading for accuracy. You are better off getting one from Wal-Mart."
1,Good deal,Got the product just in the nick of time.. and its works fine. Use it as an indicator in my DSLR storage box. So far no issues and I rate it as a good device.
1,Disappointed--inaccurate,"Very disappointed... purchased this for our toddler's bedroom so we could monitor the humidity and temperature for her, especially important at night/sleeptimes. The enviracaire is consistently inaccurate by at least 3 degrees. The idea is great and we were really excited to find this product but we've since tossed it. We're looking for something else."
3,Cost of Shipping is OUTRAGEOUS,"I liked the large digital display, and from reading what others have said and what I'd investigated on my own (this is made by Honeywell, a reputable company)I decided to buy it. This would have been a 5 star item from me had the price of shipping not been positively outrageous. The item itself was approx. $11.00, which is very fair--then to ship this thing which barely weighs a couple of ounces, they charge you practically ANOTHER $11.00. I know, I asked for it, and I got it; but I still say, in retrospect, I'd have preferred getting one of the other hygrometers (I already had ordered another as I want one in the front of the house and one in the bedroom)at a DECENT shipping cost (it was $4.00 shipping for the other brand. My recommendation... do NOT pay nearly $12.00 for this thing in shipping fees--it's positively ridiculous."
3,It's okay,"We needed some small thermometers to gauge the fluctuation in room temperature throughout our house. I had a hard time finding just a thermometer that we could set on the window sill or a desk. Finally settled on this humidity/temperature device. It's the right size and easy to read although the humidity numbers are larger than the temperature so we had to get used that. What has bothered us, however, the two, setting side by side, do not display the same temperature. Which is correct? So while they have been somewhat helpful we just have to wonder how accurate they are."
4,Great,"This is a very responsive temperature and humidity gauge. Many digital thermometers take minutes to gauge the temperature, but this one does it in seconds. I don't know how long the battery will last, but I'm impressed."
4,seems to work well,Bought two of these for bedrooms after we found out my daughter and I are both allergic to dust mites. They seem to work well and we know the temp works properly because it agrees to the reading on the heating system. Humidity is under 50% so hopefully the dust mites won't be an issue.
1,Inaccurate hygrometer,The hygrometer reads about 10 less than the actual RH. How do I know this? Do a search on testing hygrometers and you will find out how to do the salt test. I tested this one along with another known good one and it failed. This far off is no good for my purposes.
5,Humidity Temperature Indicator,Looks just like the picture. Works well and appears to be accurate. I am happy with the purchase.
2,Real Problems With Accuracy,"I purchased 6 of these temperature/humidity indicators. Five of these units read within 2 to 4 degrees of each other (on both temperature and humidity readings). Not real consistency when it comes to accuracy. I wanted to put one of these in each room to monitor the humidity and temperature, but the inconsistency in the readings makes this difficult. The really bad news is that one of the six units I purchased is off by over 16 degrees. These units are clever and inexpensive, but, I guess the old saying still goes: ""You get what you pay for!"" If you are looking for accuracy, you better spend more money and purchase something better, that is accurate."
3,In the ballpark,"The temperature reading is consistently a couple degrees higher than our other thermometer, but we got it for the hygrometer. Again, we only need a rough sense of whether our baby's room is too dry, so the simplified scale below the reading is just fine. Not sure how accurate the humidity number is, but it seems close enough for our needs."
5,PURE ANARCHO PUNK,Disorder are punk at its best. Most of their best stuff is collected on this album but the other are brilliant to. They are even better live if u catch them now as their getting on a bit.
2,I will rate it 6 out of 10,"Hi allgood dayThis product is for beginners and not for complete or advanced learning of TA.The product is good,the language is succinct. This will be useful for high school students and serves as a TA for dummies. Life positions, Descriptive Model and how to recognize Ego States with verbal and non verbal cues and how to communicate in a complimentary manner were not described.Moreover it is more like a cartoon for kids. Had it been real characters it would have served a better purpose. The human touch is missing as TA is all about that.But I appreciate the author for the pains he has taken as something is better than nothing as to my knowledge there are no other videos on TA.Thanksalchlonist@gmail.compsychologist and corporate trainerChennai - India."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this after watching some short videos on Transactional Analysis on YouTube [...] assuming that this video went into more depth. Sadly, this DVD doesn't even cover the same breadth of material.I'll give away the punch-line from the DVD: Buy the book ""I'm OK, You're OK"".My advice: Watch the TA videos on TheraminTrees channel."
5,Easy to grasp,This DVD is a very easy to understand and grasp what it is being intended to help one on.I highly recommended to just about anyone.
4,OK reference,"This book contains a lot of factual errors about the films, and it is not particularly insightful about anything in particular. Its biographical and pictorial coverage is more complete on Jeanette's behalf than Nelson's. Then again, Jeanette did have the longer film career and a fortuitous association with the celebrated Lubitsch. All in all, for the price, it's a respectable buy. I bought it in hardcover for the pictures (some are beautiful, some seem strange choices)."
1,Have to agree with Jamie,"I have to agree with Jamie on this review. The book was well-written, but I learned some horrible things about LeAnn. I was on the border of fan/disliker, and this book pushed me to the disliker side. LeAnn talks about ex-classmates as if they were all jealous of her. While some of those ex-classmates have stated that they hated her because she was so snobby about being famous. This book just really makes me feel disgusted that I ever liked LeAnn."
1,"Ok, I'm Convinced!","I did not BUY the book, I did not READ the book, I am not a FAN of 'what's-her-name', and I think she is a spoiled rotten, rich slob!"
2,Simply terrible,Software Piracy Exposed is riddled with factual and grammatical errors and contradictory information. The book also contains a completely unrelated and unnecessary chapter on basic computer security. Avoid this book.
4,mmla04,these work good in addition to regular snips. they are especially usefull for making longer cuts in vynal siding.
4,Review of the OutSet QM40 BBQ Brush,"I purchased this bbq brush, as I was tired of the typical bbq brushes you purchase in a hardware store. This brush is very sturdy and pretty ergonomic. I think it works very well and will last me a long time."
5,Everything I had wanted,"I got this 3 days after I ordered it, it was also it great condition with exactly like the picture, I couldn't have asked for anything else!"
5,Great quality for an insanely low price!,Love them! SO CHEAP! Shopping on Amazon is amazing -- I can't imagine ever finding such a deal in the actual Stride Rite store.
4,Yesterday's Promise,"Yesterday's Promise is the second of three East of the Sun series. It is an involved story with mystery, adventure and romance. I would recommend reading the first, Tomorrow's Treasure first. I think it would give a better grasp of the people and situations involved in the story. There are interesting situations and places with valuable treasure, tribal difficulties, and power struggles. I appreciated the author's historical information and a list of historical dates following the story. The writing is a little too flowery for me, but that is a personal preference. There were too many characters without proper development, possibly because the characters were in the previous book."
3,I enjoyed this,"I really enjoyed this book - I would advise you to read the first book in the series before you read this one - it will help you understand the characters better.This has very detailed descriptions of South Africa and - the then Rhodesia, I am a Zimbabwean living in South Africa so I really enjoyed all the historical information as well as the maps well done Linda !!I will definitely be reading the next book in the series to find out what happens next. This book has a bit of everything, mystery, intrigue, romance."
4,Will Rafuse does wine well,"This set was perfect to ""finish"" the wall where our wall-mount wine rack is, we have a few other Rafuse prints in the dining room and these just tied it all together!"
4,Excellent resource for self-teaching,"The canonical reference to C++ is ""The C++ Programming Language"" by Stroustrup. If you are learning C++ on your own, the book ""C++ Solutions"" is a great help in gaining insight into many of the exercises Stroustrup suggests.Updated source code can be download from the author's website. Which is good, because there are some errors in the book source.Also, on some Exercises, the author assumes knowledge that has not yet been introduced in the Stroustrup book. So, there is a little jumping around.The writing is clear and explanations are good.Minor faults aside, this is a VERY helpful book for newbies to C++, and I would recommend it to anyone learning C++ on thier own."
1,Huge disappointment,"The plot had the potential of being a really good story, but sadly did not live up to my hopes. This is the only book by this author that I can honestly say I hated. The hero in this story is not at all likable. Infact he is a big jerk who mistreats her awful. Then there is no learning his lesson or growing as a person. He forces his way into her home with some flowers and says he loves her and all is forgiven. Totally unrealalistis and a huge waste of time"
5,The most definitive Royal Commemorative book I've seen.,This is the most complete Royal Commemorative book I have yet to come across. It shows color and black and white photos of Royal Commemorative collectables past and present. With descriptive information and value. I am a avid collector and I consider this book to be my Bible. A must have for anyone who collects or is simply interested in the British Monarchy.
2,Disappointed,"I was specifically looking for the Halloween mix as pictured. It should have included candy corn and other butter cream holiday pieces such as pumpkins and ears of corn, traditional orange and black jelly beans and foil covered chocolate balls in autumn colors. This mix is widely available. The addition of licorice non-pareils is much more difficult to find and I was delighted to see it on Amazon, ordering 3 pounds of this family favorite. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was to receive the mix without ANY non-pareils. I could have avoided the expense of shipping (and not a small amount) by going down to the corner store. This was most definitely false advertising and a great disappointment."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I bought this based on the previous reviews. Very disapointing. I have many other embroidery books that are far better. Helen Stevens does pretty work, but a majority of the stitches are straight stitches (satin stitch) and only the thread choice seems to make her work shine. Do yourself a favor...try to get an Erica Wilson book...you can still get some used, or borrow from the library. Or look around at other embroidery books/authors. This one is very limited."
4,Mary Magdalen,"Gives some good insights. Raises some questions, however. It describes Mary the mother of Jesus as having an older sister.Per the Protoevangelium Jacobi, Anna and Joacim were childless before the birth of Mary."
2,BE CAREFUL BEFORE ORDERING,I searched for Signature Webkinz and this came up - I also thought I was buying a Webkinz. Very disappointed to find out it was not a Webkinz when my grandaughter told me.
1,Not a WEBKINZ!!!,"I wish I had read the other review before I ordered this ""stuffed animal"". I couldn't wait for my grand daughter to get this Panda, she loves Webkinz and I have bought others in the past. This time I bought her what I thought was the Signature Webkinz which I knew cost a little more money but I wanted to have it out as a gift ""from Santa"".It was a disappointment, and I was disappointed.Pay attention shoppers."
3,DVD-R should be labeled as such.,"Not restored but good quality DVD-R, which Amazon usually labels as such, but not in this case. First half of movie is typical De Mille morality play but the second half is fantastic Buck Rogers musical. The problem with DVD-R is not just player compatibility problems but also longevity issues, will it last 2 years or 5 years?"
3,"not great, but not bad","I like what DeMille does a few years past this, thinks like Cleopatra, Sign of the Cross etc...and he was cutting his teeth here - talkies were just coming in and they threw lots of ""musical"" parts into films as they tested the waters as to what would bring the crowds in. This film would have been much better, without that aspect. Nice premise and the end-part of the film when the floating hedonistic party, takes the thunderstorm damage and ---(spoiler alert)--- they have to parachute off it to survive. But the film, while a morality play - IS irritating as the people are such weak morons. What is the premise for the whole ending seems to be, God giving them the smack-down. But they get away with it and there is little satisfaction ---- or as to quote from another movie ""well, maybe they needed some killing"". Good film for a collector and cleaned up VERY well -- but don't expect the usual DeMille drama - it is not here like you would anticipate."
1,"Despite what this book tells you, ""no"" does mean NO!","I'm happy to see that the majority of reviewers see this book as a joke. However, I must caution anyone who does not:If you don't stop when a girl expresses anything that resembles discomfort or the desire for you to stop, you are a CRIMINAL.Do not firmly hold anyone down. Do not stop anyone from getting up from the couch/bed/etc. Do not keep going when she says no."
2,Promotion,This book promotes date rape in a comedic way. Not the best thing for people to be reading this century.
2,Poorly written,"Hardly a book - 30 page pamphlet really. It was very poorly written. 16 quick stories about the early discoveries of some of Arizona's mines. I did get a few interesting tidbits out of it, but that is about it. Most of these mines were owned by Phelps-Dodge, and apparently they commissioned this pamphlet to mark their 100 year anniversary in 1981. Wish they would have put a little more into it....."
2,Yet no pull,"Another plodding, if gentler relic of the early 70's Italian prog scene suffers from conscious compositional laboring, dated demeanor and overbearing vocals."
1,Unhappy,"Although this book contains information relating to the ""Macabre"" happenings in and about New England, it simply re hashes old tales and historic information provided elsewhere.The title is also quite deceptive as it alludes to the book being about New England, when in fact most coverage are of events in other localesIf you have never heard of Ax murderess Lizzie Borden, you may be interested in this book. If you know there were Witch trials in Salem Massachusetts, save your money as there are much better books available on this and most of the subjects covered in this meandering ""Docu Drama"""
4,I liked the book a lot- its a good read,I liked this book and I have told other people to read it. I thought there would be more fantasy type stuff in it but I learned a lot from the history that she writes about. I would tell people who like history and true crime stories to read this book.
4,Lots of Background Fun Style!!!,"I enjoyed this book very much. The wealth of information is presented in in a conversational manner which I preferred since I wanted a ""pleasure read"" that didn't have a textbook feel. The easy tone of the book by no means takes away from the plethora of information which the author has presented within. I liked how the different facets of New Egland Folklore were compared with the bigger picture. It is a nice illustration of how Ancient cultures like Europe and Egypt and ongoing historical events laid the groundwork for the legends and unusual/macabre customs present in America. The interview that tied the horrors of the Holocaust into a modern New England life was so moving that I will never forget it. I was mainly interested in the historical stories more so than the ""spooky"" ones. The scary legends were written well, but were just a bit much for my tastes."
4,Good inspiration,"This book is full of unusual details such as-drawers in staircases and wall niches. Many of the details focused on are what give a house character. I'm designing my own house and it helped me to think above issues rarely addressed in the ""how to books"". Conran addresses light and space in a very compelling format. There are tons of photos. My only complaint is that with all the photos its hard to go back and find things again."
3,"Some Great Characters, Disappointing Plot","I loved the heroine Tamara Swift. Her brother isn't that strong a character, but I love him when he stands up for her and acknowledges her gifts. The best ghost is Bodicia. This novel's Byron is fun at times, but a complete travesty of the historical Byron. This is the first time I have ever seen Byron portrayed as effete. He was actually a rather macho athletic type who died while on a military campaign. I think the authors have him confused with Oscar Wilde.The plot improved in the last third of the book, but not tremendously. A flashback for the villain would have given the book a great deal more power."
1,Worst video ever,This is the absolute worst video I have ever seen. The picture is grainy and the camera work is pathetic. There were very few actually naked girls in the entire video. It consisted mostly of what appears to be some grainy recording done at a private strip party or something. The girls are not attractive at all. This video does much injustice to the name Ass Illustrated. It lives up to none of the expectations touted in the advertisement for it...
4,Beautiful light,"I first found this item at a retail store out of state. I was disappointed that I didn't have the funds to buy the number of night lights I wanted to purchase so I was excited when I found a wide variety of discounted lights online. The price was reasonable, the item was gorgeous and I was thankful to receive free shipping."
5,100 Years From Now People Will Still Find This Amazing,"The singular voice of Mary Fahl. The inspired music and words. Both October Project albums will stand the test of time. They are the priceless jewel that you stumble across in the desert. All three generations of my family love this music. I have had to buy 5 copies to replace those that I have loaned out. If you haven't experienced this music, you should get out that credit card NOW!"
5,"A Crime of ""Epic"" Proportions","Anyone who has heard October Project, either on disc or, more importantly, live, will agree that this is not your average band. This is a one time collection of talent that engages the listener and takes them to places no other group has been able to lead us. No one I've introduced October Project to has thought differently than any other reviewer here. That's high praise. There is a tremendous void left by Sony's bail out. Fans can only be consoled by their unrealized potential and vain searches for former member in other venues."
2,Um... i don't get it,"I purchased this CD after reading the slew of 5 star reviews posted here. It was recommended by amazon based on my prior history (Love Cocteau Twins, Natalie Merchant, Dead Can Dance etc...)After listening to the entire CD twice.. I must confess, I just don't get it. While many of the lyrics are beautiful.. the CD sounds like a weird cross between Christian Rock (music) and Grace Slick (singing style). I did not find the music very complex, atmospheric or interesting in the least. Sounded like one of those New Age CDs they sell in gift stores to me.Sounds like the music moved a lot of people deeply, that is fine.. I am sure many would not like all the music I do.. just thought there should be an alternative view from all the 5 star ""This is the greatest album ever"" reviews."
3,Just OK,I bought this after I bought a Mary Fahl solo CD which I loved. This group is pretty good and some of the tracks are nice to listen to but not really my style.I would rather just listen to Mary sing.
4,Once upon a time...,Once upon a time I saw these folks open up for Sarah MacLachlan. I had never heard of them before. They blew me away. So I got this CD. It is a great CD. It is an artistically pleasing whole--no weak spots. It also has some great songs that can easily stand alone. Return to Me is unforgettable. I strongly encourage anyone to get this disc. It is worth it.
4,"good, exciting entertainment",This video delivers what would be called eroctism at its best.It delivers good views from a hidden camera stand point.It delivers ( smile ) a good plot. See for your self.
2,Not so unique ideas,"While I will be using one of the ideas in the book (having the groomsmen had each bridesmaid her boquet and then walk down the aisle) many of the ideas aren't orginal, such as leaving the ceremony in a horse-drawn carriage. Others are not meant for a traditional wedding ceremony, such as parachuting. Also, the book only covers the ceremony, not the reception. The book is really quite ugly, and you wouldn't be losing anything to go with a used copy... it's paperback and spiral bound, so it's really not going to be a keepsake book. Worth it to spend under $4 on a used on, not over that."
1,Bad Condition,I ordered this book as a gift. It cost over $32 for a paperback book and the condition was ridiculous! Looked like something had been spilled on it. I was embarrassed to to give it as a gift.
1,Biased Beyond a Reasonable Doubt!,"Besides being boring and tedious, it is so biased as to render the book unbelievable on many levels.Anyone who follows true crime - crime scenes, forensics, etc - can easily see that the writer has hand picked his information to support his conclusion.Not worth reading if you want a balanced view of this case."
4,It was GREAT but the ending sucked.,"I LOVED the first few chapters but the ending was really boring. I think I skimmed through the last 3 chapters because they were making me sleepy! Other than that, I enjoyed the book because it was informative and easy to read! I also love that they used examples of real people."
5,WHAT A BARGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ah at last Donkey Kong! I found this baby while searching amazon for old nintendo games while lounging near my indoor pool in my $100,000,000 mansion while I was viewing some nice wholesome programming on my 500 inch plasma screen tv. See I was expecting the price to be around $10,000,000 and I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend that much on a game, but then my mind was blown when I saw seller Annie May's price of just $2,160,000!!!!!!! You can imagine my surprise. After eating the meal prepared by my personal master chef I purchased the item. I received it about a week later. This game goes great with my $8,000,000 copy of Super Mario Brothers, my $4,000,000 copy of Bomberman, my $4,500,000 copy of Excitebike, and my $6,250,000 copy of Pac-Man. Thank you Annie May for your unbelievably cheap game!!! Now if you'll excuse me I must attend to my army of great white sharks. They get a little feisty when I forget to change the laser cannons equipped to their backs!!"
1,Terrible,"Okay..im a big fan of hootie, but i waqs really disipointed when it came because it was broken.It was ripped up, pieces were cut off the tape and it played 30 seconds and that was it. And them worst part is, the seller wont respond to my emails. I still love Hootie but am furious with the seller of this item. So if your thinking of buying this make sure you are positive it is in good condition."
1,coco lee IS mariah carey,"For those of you who love Mariah Carey, good news. Now you can get twice as much of her music. Coco Lee even looks like Mariah Carey! Like Mariah Carey, she also makes sad attempts at being ""urban"" and ""hip"" with her weak dabbling in R&B. And for those of you who loath Mariah Carey, you have been amply warned of this oncoming menace."
1,she will never make it for a decade - this was her last one,"this album is a load of hogwashed! she sounds terrible is one thing, the fact that she can't sing at alL!"
3,Degas and the Dance,"The Impressionist painter Edgar Degas (1834-1917) is best known for his pastel and oil paintings of ballet dancers at practice. Rubin's book focuses on these ballet paintings and describes the artists' techniques. In addition to displaying over thirty full-color paintings, the book also gives brief biography, but otherwise offers little to no insight into who Degas was as a person."
3,This is good?,"Too many times, the Pittsburgh winds and strings have fallen prey to the bombastic playing by their colleagues in the percussion and brass sections. This time the organ is out of control as well. Though everyone plays superbly, the balance of the orchestral voices is annoying. EMI released a Saint-Saens 3rd approximately at the same time that is far superior to this recording. This is not one of Pittsburgh's finest."
3,This book is NOT vegan!,"don't make the same mistake i did--since the authors also wrote ""The Vegan Gourmet"" (which is my favorite cookbook)--i thought there other books would be vegan. this one isn't. there are vegan recipes in this book and they are labeled so. also i do not like how the ingredients are listed--it is akward. there are two columns--the first with the ingredients then next to it the amounts--it makes it hard to read."
1,Arrived broken.,"The set is very pretty, but not packaged well. When mine arrived, 2 canisterswere broken. I'm in the process of buying a house, as mine had burned down inJune,so just didn't have the time, or effort to re-package and send back, so I'mout of the money I spent.This item was packaged in a large box with several other breakable kitchen items from Amazon. All werepacked well and arrived in good condition, except the canisters.This was not due to Amazonspackaging, but to the canister manufacturer. I've never received an order from Amazon thatthere was any problem with."
2,Confusing... but impressive,"G. L. Giles V2:B4 was my first encounter with her world. I know the city of Charleston and surrounding areas well and it is readily apparent she does too. Her ideas are fresh and unique to a sometimes stale genre. However, the illustrations were unnecessary, and a little juevenile, the story jumped around a fair bit, and the characters lacked the depth one hopes for. In her defense, this is a prequel and one should not necessarily know the characters well, especially if they missed her first novel. Too, vignettes are not designed to give an entire story, just a short piece, or in her world, a small taste.The narrative threw me a bit, but it is simply a matter of stlye and taste. G. L. Giles knows what she wants to say and the message, though occasionally garbled does come through."
1,Simply atrocious.,"I see much praise for this book, yet I don't get it. I fought my way through half before finally accepting defeat. The story itself has potential, but the writing was chaotic at best. I've read works from 7th grade school children that were better written. The author's bio claims she graduated cum laude from college, but I have to wonder in what? it definitely wasn't literature. If you are looking for something to use as a model of how NOT to write I highly recommend this book. Otherwise save yourselves the trouble. Published by Xlibris, a vanity press, this is probably the only way this book would ever have seen the light of day."
5,Loved it!,This is a must read! I found it to be the best book on mutual funds out there. It really takes all of the confusion out of funds and makes for a great Internet companion
2,The may be soft but they don't do the wiping very well,People seem to love these wipes because they are so soft. My problem with them is they aren't effective at wiping up .... poop. They just smear it around. I much prefer the Huggies for the wipes although I use the Papmpers diapers.
3,Disapointing,"I was expecting fantastic wipes from Pampers since they are one of the more expensive brands. What we got was disapointment - the wipes themselves are OK, though maybe a tiny bit too thin. However, it is absolutely impossible to pull them apart - when they sit in a wipes tub, you pull one out and half the box comes out (I feel like I'm a magician pulling out colorful handkerchiefs). We tried Huggies wipes and they are much sturdier, thicker and pull out one by one. Even cheap Walgreens wipes were better - they felt more like a material rather than paper. Unfortunately, we must say that we are switching to Huggies."
2,Not so good,I always thought that unscented means that fragrance chemicals haven't been added. Wrong! Unscented means that it was additionally chemically treated to masque the scent. So it is not a solution for the sensitive skin.
3,"Pampers Baby Wipes Refills, Natural Aloe, Unscented, 770 Wipes","For something that's supposed to be unscented, these do have a somewhat strong scent. I actually thought that they had sent me the scented ones by mistake, but I double-checked the box and it does say ""unscented"". They work fine (they're nice and thick) and are supposed to be alcohol-free, but I do find the scent to be unpleasant and annoying."
1,Leaves fibers on my baby's privates,"At first i thought these wipes were amazing beause they are so soft, but I noticed tiny linty fibers on my son's penis that would get stuck around there. Also the wipes leave an oily and slightly stinky odor on your hands. I am going back to Huggies wipes!"
3,"Great wipes, too expensive","These were great wipes and I used them exclusively until the price went up and shipping charges were added. I switched to something else when that happened, but only due to price, not quality."
5,Excellent quality!,"We used different brand of baby wipes before, and we also used several different types of wipes from Pampers. But Pampers Baby wipe, Nautral Aloe is really the best one we tried so far! It's not scented and the wipes are just great on baby's skin!"
4,"Good product, just not to my liking","I tried these wipes because of an Amazon promotion and while they work OK, I prefer Huggies. These seem somehow flimsier (for lack of a better word), and seem like they would work well for an infant or a child not yet totally on solid food, but they are kind of a hassle with my two year old. I'll use them up, so you know they aren't THAT bad, but I wouldn't buy them again, even with a promo. It's not a quality of product issue, more just a preference thing. I'll stick with Huggies wipes and Pampers Cruisers for diapers."
1,Not hypo-allergenic,I have used Pampers unscented and pampers sensitive for quite a while and my daughter kept getting yeast infections. I switched to CVS brand Non-scented wipes and she has not broken out since. I Will NEVER GO BACK.
1,Check the expiration date!,"Individual plastic packages can't be opened without scissors. After opening them that way wipes dry quickly and become unusable.Also, all the individual bags within the large box had an expired date printed on them. Does that mean they are dangerous for my baby?!"
3,Ok product,These are ok but I was sorry I bought a whole case of them. Huggies are better because they are thick cloth type. These are very light and thin. They worked OK though.
3,"Ok, but nothing special","I'd been using the ""sensitive"" Pampers wipes, but thought I'd try these because we'd used this kind with our first child, and these are cheaper than the ""sensitive"" ones. As someone else mentioned, they seem to have changed the formula at some point, because even though they claim to be alcohol free and unscented, they smell (kind of like alcohol). I think my daughter is getting more irritated from these, too. They're not any better at coming out of the box than any of the other kinds. I'm going back to the sensitive wipes.I've never found wipes that I really loved."
5,"Pampers Baby Wipes Refills, Unscented, 770 wipes","These are great. Been sending them to our troops in Iraq. They wanted the unscented. It's so very dusty there that besides cleaning their faces and hands, they have been known to even clean away the grime on their weapons.God bless our Troops."
3,Not Huggies!,"These wipes are just ok-I definitely prefer the Huggies wipes. I feel that they are thicker and softer than Pampers and they come out of the dispenser more easily. Huggies are cheaper, too!"
4,Great Bowl,"I started with Pistoulet pattern, but couldn't find any large bowls. The Napoli uses the same colors and works well with the plate set I have. I have only used the oval vegetable bowl as a chips bowl so far, but if the pattern holds up as well as the other pieces I have, I will be pleased. I have no qualms about using it with hot vegetables. While the edges are more delicate than the rest of the pieces, I don't think they are an issue. I've bumped mine several time with no problems.I highly recommend this bowl. It is beautiful and useful."
5,Serving bowl,"The item was in great condition, and I tried the bowl and their was no problems that was wrong with the bowl!"
3,"Pretty, but beware of chips","I love this pattern, and have purchased several pieces from the Napoli line. After just one use, though, I noticed a chip in the paint on the rim of this bowl. I am very careful with my bowls and platters, but it happened anyway.Still a gorgeous piece of pottery...just a bit ""lived in"" now."
2,Outdated before the ink dried,"Intended to be THE 265 ""charged"" words of its day; the last word in the ""go to"" vocabulary, as it were, turned out to be a fleeting exercise in arrogance. The book's strong point was that it gave very clear and detailed explanations of these 265 words. Its weak point was that the words chosen, were ""one man's selection,"" arguably, hardly a true representative of what the market of communication at the time called for.Dr. de Bono's collection did not endure. A better approach would of course have been to produce an annual update to the list, or even a dictionary of such ""charged"" words.The worse of the de Bono lot. Two stars."
5,Disabled Emily and her amazing horse go for the blue!,"When the Saddle Club's Pony Club, Horse Wise, helps out at Free Rein, a theraputic riding center, Stevie, Lisa, and Carole make a knew friend. Emily Williams is physically disabled. She and her wonderful horse P.C. try their hardest to compensate for it. Emily starts coming to Horse Wise just about the time of the handy hunter competition, a type of horse show. A snobby girl named Veronica DiAngelo makes fun of Emily's disabilities. The Saddle Club decides she needs a taste of her own medicine. They help Emily train for the show. In the end Emily wins the blue, beating Veronica and her fancy horse Danny, disabilaties and all!"
5,EHXAUST PIPE,It was a gift for my son and he is very happy with it.IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL IT.GOOD PRODUCT
4,great product,use daily. Product is easy to adjust for differant trailers being towed. Hooked up myself with included instructions and a little help from the web
5,Pooper Scooper,"It's too bad that this was never released, or even picked up by her new record company.However, for those of you who may want to pick up the VHS, here is a fair warning: The VHS version may have really bad background noise throughout EVERY SINGLE SONG. It's like a buzz. I've returned my VHS to Amazon over and over again and every VHS is the same way. Maybe there are some out there that sound good, but just beware.Best bet would take your VHS copy to a photo/digital place and have them convert it to DVD and take out that noise."
1,POOP!,"No more Atlantic and a non existant DVD when I finally got up to date with today's technology. Tori is a BABE no matter what ""form"" she's in! VHS, rewind, fast-forward, pause, here I come..."
4,Beautiful show,"Great topical series, good action, keeps moving all the time. The best part is the cinematography and the great foreign locales. Just gorgeous scenery, great camera shots. Annie is wonderful and sexy, the other characters are all a bit weak - not the fault of the actors, just really out of place and boring dialog and dumb story lines at times. If only the writing was as good as the rest of it this would be a truly superb series. Annie/Auggie is cliche and inevitable, the stars are trying really hard and the fans want it to happen because it's a nice friendship, but probably they should have stuck with Ben or Simon or...Still worth buying to be able to feel like an international spy over and over again."
1,I was disappointed with this episode,"I like Covert Affairs, but this episode was ruined by the ending. I don't believe Auggie would be this big of a wimp about his fiance at the end."
2,This is a rip.,"I do subscribe to this show through Amazon so it was not too surprising when a new one showed up off the weekly cycle. It turned out that this episode is a prequel to the series and is only 19 minutes long, even though it still costs $1.89. It tells the story of Augie learning to cope with being a blind agent handler. It takes place in Barcelona and since I haven't been there in 45 years I found the travelogue aspect beautiful. The story is sort of weak, given that we already had one show about Augie getting blinded in Iraq. Annie the usual heroine is not in this at all. It is an OK sort of clip but not worth the price of a full episode."
5,Great program without too much graphic violence,Excellent writing and acting; a very fun show to watch year after year. A very creative suspense/crime drama without the type of non-stop graphic violence found in other programs in this genre.
