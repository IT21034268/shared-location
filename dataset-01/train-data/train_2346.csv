4,Review by Allison,"I thought the book Lovey, A Very Speical Child was a very inspiring book! It is really hard for me to get interested in a book but this one really held my attention. Reading about the things that happened in Hannah's life made me have many emotions. It made me feel so happy for Hannah that she was making progress, and I loved how the boys enjoyed watching her do so also. Her home life frustrated me alot because I did not like how her family brought her down on herself so much. Mary was an excellent teacher for these children, and she knew her ways with them. Hannah made my heart melt when she gave her two teeth and the picture of the heart to Mary. I did not want the kids to leave on the last day because it made me cry knowing that their teacher would not be back for them next year. This book made me feel good inside that these children were getting help and support from someone who cared much about them."
5,Great Bully Sticks,These are some of the best Bully Sitcks I have purchases. They were very thick and fresh. The dogs loved these sticks. I will definately purchase more.
4,"A quick solution, but not as strong as hand staples",These staples make quick work of fastening Romex to wood. The pull on the gun is stiff but allows one handed operation. If you staple at an angle they may need a hammer tap to sink all the way. They do not hold as well as traditional insulated staples and do not hold more than one wire. The gun takes two blocks of 10 staples and so runs out fairly quickly. It jambs occasionally but clears with needle nose pliers fairly easily.
2,Lacks of originality,"I feel disappointed with Gamma Ray: The introduction of the song #4 ""HELL IS THY HOME"" sounds exactly like Judas Priest's song ""Leather Rebel"" from CD ""Painkiller"" (1990). This is a total shame, Â¿what about copyrights?. I saw Gamma Ray in concert this year along with Helloween in the ""hellish tour"" and I liked their show, but now i am very angry with them because I pay to hear NEW and ORIGINAL stuff. All in all, this CD deserves two stars because the music is well executed but it lacks of originality."
4,Still lovin' the GR!,"I'd like to just carry on where the others have left off, this cd is frikin' awesome.European power metal is one of my personnal favorite styles of metal,even though I pretty much like them all. They just seem to have a formula that works.Anyway, if you like Helloween, you'll dig this big time.Check it out.I highly recommend getting this release as the others have done."
5,Simply MAJESTIC,"Gamma Ray still rules! This is one of the best albums ever from the band. Many thanks to Mr Kai Hansen and his band members, you are unique."
5,Could have been made the 18 or 20 biggest,"I have been a George Jones fan since i was a young boy. Songs like The Grand Tour, and The Door send chills up my spine.George Jones has a way of getting to your heart, and you can feel the heartbreak in the songs. Even my 17 year old daughter is a fan, her favorite is Wine Colored Roses. I recently had the treat of seeing the Possum in concert, and what a treat it was. Long may George Jones reign as a living legend in Country music."
4,Good source for medical marijuana patients,I bought this for a friend who uses pot for her medical problems. We all know that smoking is bad for us. These recipes enable her to create foods that taste good (no grass taste) and deliver the THC that gives her relief.
5,Cool,"Great book for learning many recipes, love just browsing through it and seeing stuff I never seen before. I recommend this to anyone in the market"
1,"Should be called the Wealthy Person's Guide, misleading","Waste of money for those hopeful expats without unlimited bank accounts. Much of the info is also outdated or seen through the proverbial rose-colored glasses. Often deceptive or misleading--I wasted more time trying to use the info during my move, than I would have just trying to figure things out on my own. Just one example, the author says you can open a bank account during a ""preliminary visit"" and recommends Banque Transatlantique. Then you find out on your own that you HAVE to be living in France with your green card in order to open an account AND that BT's required [high account balance]. Waste of time and money!!"
2,A Not Too Bright Grown-Up's Guide to France,This is real lightweight stuff. Lacks depth and lacks details to be of any help to the serious expat-wannabe. I think many of the reviews full of over-the-top praise must be written by the author's friends or at least by those in the same clique. Skim this book while you're having a latte at Border's and save yourself some money.
4,The One You Need,"If you're planning a sojourn in France and need to know the nuts and bolts of required papers, permits, finance, utilities, etc., about living there, this is the book to buy. The author emphasizes real-world solutions to issues. I found the advice in the book to be practical, reality-based, and most helpful."
3,A Mixed Bag,"Like many story collections, this one is truly a mixed bag. Among the highlights are some delightfully funny annecdotes of crimes gone wrong and some heartwarming stories of police at their very best. However, there are also stories that are criminally mundane, and others so syrupy sweet they border on offensive. The extensive section of 9/11 stories is overkill. There is little there that hasn't already been said many times over, with the common theme being that we owe a debt of gratitude to those gave the ultimate service to their country that day. A noble point, but one that has been made repeatedly. Sutton offers nothing new about 9/11, its heroes or its victims."
4,Another Good One,"I have been reading these series of books since I was in elementary school, and they are always consistently good reads and entertaining plot twists. If you have not read any in this series, almost all of them can stand alone as they are. This is another good one!"
5,A compelling and logical addition to the Flinx series,"Foster returns to the Thranx-Human Commonwealth in this continuation of the Flinx and Pip series that expands his tale of Midworld, the sentient green world. The plot expands on the growth and maturation of Flinx in his ever continuing quest to discover his heritage and his future potential. Some tantalizing hints are given about his future role in the universe in the process of his discovery and exploration of Midworld. The description of Midworld wild- and tame-life are as fascinating and as riveting as Foster ever is"
3,Flinx in holding pattern,"A good read but after raising many fascinating questions about Flinx and his universe in the preceding books, ADF proceeds to answer absolutely none of them in this book. I love Flinx and Pip, I will read anything he chooses to write about them, but I was disappointed by this book. It mainly functions for me as a promisory note, that Mr. Foster is still thinking about Flinx, and intends to continue writing about him as a character. Worth reading if you love Flinx, but it's just not quite up to the standards of the others because it's running in place."
3,A tale of Flinx and continuing tale of the commonweath,"In a sequel of the Flinx and Commonwealth books, we find Flinx and Pip fleeing from a would-be kidnapper and landing on the jungle planet of Midworld. This book came as rather a disappointment to followers of the Flinx saga as hinted in chronology set forth in ""Flinx in Flux"". Not only do we not find out Flinx's ""purpose"" but this seems to be a rehash of ""Midworld"". As a rabid Foster fan, I really wanted this to be a continuation, rather than a sidestep in this series. But it still holds all the good qualities of Foster's works and should be included in your ADF library."
3,Great name...product okay,"I love Too Faced cosmetics and usually everything therein...this set is pretty, and matches things, but the quality of the brushes seems no different than something I could have purchased at Walmart for a considerably lower price."
1,Stick to Baby's Eyelids!,"These glasses are just awful. I bought them for my son in blue, thinking they'd stay on better than the plastic shades he had. Turns out the band slips, so they don't stay on at all unless you make it tight and position it just so. But, making them that tight makes the lenses stick to the baby's eyelids, causing goopy eyes. We noticed this happening time and time again: We'd put the glasses on our son's goop-free eyes, go for a walk, come back and find them stuck to his eyelids and his eyes full of goop. These went into the Diaper Champ after that. Save your money!"
5,Action with character development,"This is the frst, but certainly not the last, book I have read by John Wilcox. The hero, Simon Fonthill, is a believable character and the entire book is loaded with realistic characters. The author blends historical facts with fiction to blend his fictional character into a realistic historical setteing. There is a romantic interest without overdoing it. For the action fans, there certainly is plenty of that and it's also realistic. No glory here, only the nitty gritty of battle and by being realistic, the glory takes cre of itself. I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series."
2,A very poor copy of Fraser and Cornwall,"Cornwall is a copy of Fraser and this is a (poor) copy of Cornwall. While Cornwall's earlier Sharpe novels were quite a good read, his later ones showed a marked deterioration in plot, characterization and just generally poor(er) writing. However, any of them are preferable to ""The Horns of the Buffalo."" To put it bluntly, Wilcox sounds like a modern day Englishman trying to sound like his great-grandfather, and not suceeding.The plot is paper-thin (no pun intended), the character development pathetic and, as another reviewer has pointed out, the deux-et-machina ""solution"" at the end is the characteristic hall-mark of bad writers. Why two stars and not one? Because one-star is for the truly abysmal writing such as Flint's 1632 series. While Wilcox is bad, Flint is even worse.If you haven't already discovered the Flashman series, do so and find out how historical ripping-yarns should be written."
3,Oops,"may I point out that the battle at Isandhlwana was in Jan. 1879, not 1897 as it says in your review."
3,Not worth buying a new copy.,This book was interesting but was not a smooth read. The author had a tendency to jump from one area to another and then back to the original. The author repeated a lot of the information in each section.
4,Buy the collections,If you buy the two collections (season one and two) you will get this Summer special included with season two.I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.
4,let men watch nude flicks,Sugura shouldn't have to worry about hidding his adult books from Mahoro or even need his friends Hamaguchi & Kawahara to fight one person. Why would Managament want to treaten him anyway. The first amendment give's people the right to watch what ever they want.
3,"A Review of ""Copycat"" by Ruth Brown","This is a clever book. The artwork is probably the best part. The drawings are warm and delightful and the 'peek-a-boo' aspect only builds on this. (There are half-size pages that when turned over provide a 'feeling' of action.)That said, ""Copycat"" does not have much of a plot and for my two (boy and girl/ 3 and 5) it did not draw more than one request for a re-read. (Broken teeth are not something they could identify with.)Three Stars. Very nice art, but no plot. I think this book might actually be better for the 3 and under age range."
1,rip off!!,"I sent this to my grandson, I purchased it because he wanted a green firetruck and that was the closest I could find,I had him open it when I got down there to visit him, it was so delicate that he couldn't even play with it, it broke twice the first day so we put it up never again will I purchase something like that!! It was just fragile plastic for $20.00 plus shipping!! I found th same truck at toyrus made by matchbox, made of metal for $4.99, he plays with it all the time and is very durable."
5,VERY PLEASED!!,"I was very pleased with the costume I received. Also, I was surprised how quickly I received it, and the quality was at the top! I would highly recommend and would buy again from Amazon.com!"
2,"Good concept, but painful for me...I love the Diva Cup!","I tried this and it hurt me a lot. I tried it for several months. The rubber is just so stiff and hard, it would pop open before I was ready or just hurt on the way in, folded up. I wasn't a virgin when I started using it either.A few years after giving up on it, I decided to try the Diva cup. It has been amazing...everything I'd hoped the keeper would be. It is nice and soft, so it doesn't hurt. It is nicer to insert than a tampon."
1,Horrible Product,"This product gave me severe cramping and bleeding, it wasn't until I removed it that I realized that it had been this cup causing all the issues. I was also raw from insertion and removal, I literally cried from the pain. Maybe it's too hard a plastic, I don't know, but I use Insteads with no problems, no cramping and now I know that that is what I will stick with. I wish it would've been a better experience as I like the idea."
4,Love it.,"I first bought this on here, mainly because I only get my period once every 3-4 months. And it comes randomly too.. So why would I waste my money on a whole box of tampons, when I could just get this and use it when it need it. the only thing I don't like about it, is that it hurts like HELL to put in.. They tell you to put it in, and let it snap open, but when it snaps open.. it hurts.. badly. So, be careful when you put it in.. Instead on folding it in 4, i just fold mine in half and put in in very very very slowly so it doesn't just snap open, it comes open a lot slower. But as far as leakage, there is none, and its MUCH more sanitary than a tampon, or pad."
1,Couldn't pee,"I wanted this to work out so badly. However, I literally couldn't pee so long as I was wearing it. I would become uncomfortable, and have the constant urge to pee, but couldn't. After taking it out, I could pee freely. I decided that I didn't want to play with the cup all day long just to go pee. I don't know, maybe the softer silicone cup would work out better. From a toxic perspective, I'm not sure how I feel about putting silicone in my body. I was more comfortable with using natural rubber."
4,Good for beginners,"Easy to get more improvement with great recomment training ideas,from easy to extremely hard, from beginners to elite cyclist.Get its, and make you fit!Good books for person who interest in cycling sports"
1,Not What They Used To Be!,"I bought a set of these years ago, and used them almost daily...freezer to oven to table, on the range..never a problem, and wanted to replace the same sized casserole. As the previous reviewer stated,the rough and unfinished bottom of the dish was coarse and gritty, and scratched my table and counter. What a disappointment! I don't believe the older set I have was made in China, but here in the USA. Save your money!"
2,Never assume...,"As the other reviews stated, this is not what CorningWare French White used to be. I bought this to replace a piece we broke and when you put the old and new next to each other - what a difference. The lack of finish and quality is dramatic. The flutes on the sides aren't even the same. For people who have never had the original it's fine I guess (if you don't mind having chinese made cookware in your kitchen - which I surely do; THAT wasn't in the description either.). I never used mine on top of the stove anyway, but I do under the broiler. I'll stick with my old CorningWare and Pyrex."
2,Lid,"I can't believe this did not come with a lid! I guess I should have read the description carefully, more carefully."
3,casserole dish,It is the size for what I need but it is hard to handle since it has no handles on the side. When lifting anything heavy there is a danger of slippage. Other than that it is easy to clean and always looks nice on the table.
5,A great toy for spring and windy days!,"We have a few sky dancers and have contests with them on warm or windy days. It's a blast. Even the boys next door like them for the science element. On a windy day we launch them into the trees and sometimes have to get them down with sticks. We've read about the safety concerns. Give me a break. If your child can't figure it out to not launch it at someone's face then you have bigger problems than a Sky Dancer toy.One of the decals came off on a wing - it was frayed and flapping. It seriously affected the flight. Fixed that - tore it off. She works great. Our daughter is six. Her eight and nine-year-old friends love to come over for the launching contests too. Just silly, outdoor fun.OUTDOOR - another duh. Don't have a flying toy in the house."
2,Only works with Window 98,"Make sure this is not the same DVD/DVD-ROM I purchased. It only works with Window 98 and not compatible with any other newer Window versions (Window 2000, XP etc) Tried to call their Tech Support Dept. (phone # on back cover) and got no help at all. Once my Window 98 dies, it is toally useless. Lee & Lee Communication should have offered some type of upgrade program or better tech support. But unfortuanely, there were none. So they deserve a ""2 stars"" rating."
2,Farberware Dual Function Saucepot,"The contstruction of the pot is the high quality one would expect from Farberware. Having never seen the pot in person, I did not pick up from the picture that there is a cutout on the lid to allow for the handle of the fry basket; it just looked like a shadow. I had no interest in the fryer basket but just wanted a pot of that size. Even though I have many other Farberware pots and pans, there is no other lid in my collection that fits this pot, hence, it is just about useless to me."
2,It does not have the advertised capacity,"This wrench is advertised as having up to 1/4"" capacity. It does not. It is also very fiddly to use."
3,"Good handle, bad chuck","This T-handle appears well made, but its threading and chuck aren't up to the task of being smooth enough to fully hand-tighten a small tap without breaking out the channel-locks. In fact, the only thing harder than getting this chuck to grasp a tap is getting it to let go once you're done."
3,decent,"Thandle was little bent, needed to be bent back to make a 90 deg angle, but held the tap just fine,"
3,Wrong Tool,I misunderstood item information and got the wrong tap wrench. Did not fit my 6-48 tap. Very late due to Sandy.
2,"Doesn't fit 1/8"" taps","I bought this to use with the ""Vermont American 20371 1/8-27 NPT High Carbon Steel Pipe Tap"" and eventually returned it to Amazon. The tap did not fit in this wrench. Perhaps I misinterpreted the capacity since 1/8"" is smaller than 1/4""... Either way I ended up just using a mechanic's 10mm wrench to thread the tap for my steam radiator valve. Amazon's customer service was great in assisting my return."
5,FUNNY!,"I loved this movie!! My friends and I watch it all the time now, we love it! some parts are funny, some are just so stupid you cant help laughing. this is the only movie ive never fallen asleep watching!!"
2,A Little more desired,"The authors of this book seem to scan and summarize the life of whom many consider, including myself, to be the best salsa singer of all time. Hector LaVoe is a character of mystery, humor, tragedy, and intrigue. I wanted to learn more about why he did the things he did and why so many unfortunate destinies followed him and ultimately destroyed him. I also wanted to know more about his childhood which this book leaves out. I think a little more of this book could have focused of his musical and professional developement more thouroughly."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The origins of the Master of the Mystic Arts. This includes the work by mostly Lee, and of course, Ditko to explain to us how the surgeon Stephen Strange becomes the world's greatest sorcerer.The Ancient One, Mordo, Dormammu and the Eye of Agamotto, all that good. stuff is here. With fabulous names and fabulous spells that could have come via Lovecraft and Smith."
3,Halfway brillant...then it falls off a cliff!,"Most of the previous reviews talk about how great the Lee/Ditko run is (Strange Tales 110-146): I fully agree, it's brillant stuff that I think is even better than their run on Spiderman.Unfortunately, the post Ditko issues (147-168) are just awful (frequent writer+artist changes and pedesterian rehashes of previous ideas...Stan Lee wrote some of these issues, but he seemed bored of the series by this point.) Marvel should have saved the paper, and collected only Strange Tales 110-146."
4,One of the best Essentials,"Essential Doctor Strange starts off a little goofy but once it hits its stride, you'll find yourself reading some of the finest work of the silver age. This is a must read for any Doctor Strange fan."
2,Pretty Boring Game,"It's possible that small children would be entertained by this game, but I think even they have higher standards for video game entertainment. It also takes very little time to complete, making many free online games a better idea."
5,great resource,This book I recommend as well. Things that are important and need to be addressed and don't kno how this is a good source.
3,High functioning autism,"While I adore Jerry Newport, and would love for him to be my son, I couldn't get through this book.I think if a young adult (16+) with AS would read this book, it may be helpful.I'm a believer of sex in marriage only, and this book does not promote this belief."
5,Irving Wallace's best novel,"Emily Ashcroft goes to Berlin where her father died under mysterious circumstances while finishing his biography on Hitler.She uncovers a horrible secret...Although this is just a novel, it's extremely compelling and unpredictable. Wallace obviously did quite some research for this book which makes it even more fascinating to read.This is a lot better than ""Fatherland"" by Robert Harris which I read also. I always wondered over the past 23 years since ""The 7th Secret"" has been published, why it never has been filmed. After all, ""Fatherland"" has been filmed and is not nearly as interesting.10 stars!"
4,Above Average Book,I have read a number of historical fiction books about the end of the war and this is one of the better one. I liked the story line; it is believable once you get into the book. The author spent some time developing the plot and because of that you start to believe it. An interesting group of main characters fills out the book so that the pages really fly past you. This is a good effort by this author. If you liked this then I would suggest you look at Fatherland by Robert Harris.
3,Hitler may have survived after all,My mother was in German Czechoslovaki at the end of the war and one of her fellow town folk was a driver for one of the german high command generals. He told the people that he had seen Hitler in Austria and made fun of the actor portraying him in Berlin.... who knows?
1,No way!,We tried these drops 3 times. Each time my son's pain increased to the level of screaming. Horrible stuff. The active ingredient in these drops is simethicone. It actually works by taking smaller gas bubbles and breaking the surface tension so that they form into larger bubbles. This creates giant painful bubbles. It was horrible to watch. I will never give him these or any other similar drops again! Hyland's colic tablets are much better for my baby. I have had wonderful results with them.
4,Not bad.,"This short has good acting from the lead and the agent character. The sound could have been a little better, and some of the supporting cast weren't that good, with regard to believability, but overall I liked the effort and product for an Indy pic."
1,where is it???,"as of october 14th,we have yet to receive our first issue. it is taking a long time to receive the magazine."
4,Combined Stories,"This book is actually composed of two novels that were previously published. This is the story of Melissa and Jory, two best friends from very different backgrounds. The first book is from Melissa's point of view when we find out she has cancer and how she copes with that. Melissa's brother, Jory's not-so-secret crush, doesn't take the news well and seems to be against the world. The second story continues with the friendship and tells how Jory learns to cope with Melissa having cancer. This is a classic Lurlene McDaniel book for all thos familiar with her work. For first timers I do recommend this book and I ask what took you so long to discover McDaniel's wonderful books. I liked it because it gave two different views and it made the characters have depth. I really recommend the One Last Wish series and the Dawn Rochelle novels for those who want to read more of McDaniel's work."
4,"Great clamp, poor price.","I bought a bunch of these at Lowes for 19.97 a pair. I love the clamps, very handy for small jobs. They won't replace my other clamp for glue ups, but they come in handy for many tasks."
4,Great and Comfy,"Great product if your bashful about your bruxism, but you really should go get one custome maid at your dentist office. I've had mine for 6 months and it's still running strong. It's very easy to use and clean."
4,No more night grinding,My dentist has informed me that my teeth are no longer being worn down from my night grinding! I am happy to report that this comfortable mouth guard is the best on the market. You hardly know it is there.
4,Sleep right delivery wrong,"The mouth guard is good, easy to use right out of the box. Just popped it in, set the spacer for my mouth and presto. There is some discomfort, but this guard is better than anything I've found in store and is much cheaper than a $400 custom made from the dentist that breaks when dropped.Target took 3 weeks to deliver this little package and it came in a box big enough to hold War and Peace."
2,Did not fit even though adjustable,This night guard did not fit even though it is adjustable. I tried everything but it did not work.
3,not doing the trick -,"Thinking that the mouth guard would help relieve the pain for TMJ -however, it is not doing the trick -will have to have more expensive therapy-"
2,Nice but Not Great!,The music is nice and kind of romantic. But the songs sound almost the same . Not much difference. The tunes are nice and soft very mellow. But like the title nice but not great.
3,muy poquito de lo bueno,"Estoy muy emocionada al encontrar este site, porque soy muy admiradora de las canciones con las que me crie escuchando en la radio y oir a mi madre cantar. pero siento que me han despertado todo este sentimiento tan bello que trato de mantener dormido dentro de mi, de melancolia por mi isla del encanto. y cuando encuentro algo asi quisiera quedarmelo y se lo muestro a mis hijos y a ellos les gusta como puedo hacer para que ellos tambien puedan disfrutar de esta bella musica.porque yo no tengo con que hacerme ni siquiera de un cd.pero muchas gracias por este espacio y que Dios les bendiga mucho, gracias por este ratito de recuerdos bellos.bye brunnie"
5,So Slept on...,"This is by far Color Me Badd's best album. It was slept on mainly because Epic/Sony did not properly promote this album. Radio was not aware of this album (for the most part) and therefore this amazing talented group of men were ignored.If you were a CMB fan in the ""I Wanna Sex You Up"" days but fell off, I recommend that you pick up this album and get re-aquainted. My favorite song on this album is the hauntingly beautiful ""Your Touch""...it should be...it was my wedding song!I can go on forever about this album and the group as a whole, but music speaks louder than words."
5,COLOR ME BADD 'S GOT IT ALL!!!!,"HAVING ALL 4 OF THEIR ALBUM ,I MUST SAY THE LATEST ONE ""AWAKENING"" IS BY FAR THEIR BEST WORK !! ALL OF THE SONGS HAVE A TRUE MEANING AND THE VOCALS WERE DONE WITH GREAT EMOTION. YOU CAN RELATE TO THE PAIN AND JOY OF THE SONGS. THIS ALBUM BY FAR SURPASSES ANY OF THEIR PREVIOUS ONES!! IN MY OPINION THIS ALBUM DESERVES A LOT BETTER ATTENTION AND CERTAINLY A LOT MORE PROMOTION BEHIND IT!! THE BOYS HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB WITH THIS ALBUM AND THEY DESERVE A GREATER RESPONSE THAN THE ONE THEY'VE BEEN GETTING!! SINCERLY A TRUE FAN MBA1"
3,Good effort and at times tunes to dance to.,"CMB hit it hard with New Jack City and carried on here with soulful tunes and good vocals...underrated in their singing, they do make a pleasing album in their growth"
3,Their creativity slipped a bit on this one,"Unfortunately, Color Me Badd's fourth album flopped badly, given that they moved to Epic after 3-4 albums with Giant. Their voices still sound good, but the creativity slipped a bit on this one. Some of the songs come off sounding directionless, and they sound so 1995 or 1996 to me, like something Celine Dion or Jessica Simpson could do with the ballads. They did a good uptempo song with Rodney Jerkins, during that heavy music time where he had up to 40 to 50 songs for artists within a 4 year period. But this album doesn't live up to the other three. However, Sam Watters has had some success lately with the songs he did on Jessica Simpson's albums (with Louis and his long last name) and he comes up with some very good stuff. Some of his songs are on this album too. I noticed that one of them shaved his formerly long locks for this album, but he looks good. CMB just didn't surprise me with this one."
4,Color Me Badd storms back with a disc for true R&B lovers,"With their 4th real album, Bryan Abrams and the boys from Oklahoma City storm back with a disc full of R&B punch. This album is not for the fly by night CMB fans, yet it is something for the faithful fans to really enjoy. Most all songs are led by Abrams and are missing lead vocals from the rest of the bunch. This album is definitely awesome; go out and get this disc."
3,its okay - not as I expected,"After hearing such great reviews on amazon, and being a new teacher I thought his would be a great cd that i could listen to and pass on to my collegues. Honestly, I would not agree with the rest of the reviewers, yeah some of the songs are pretty funny, but everyone song is the same. They all sound identicial and I had a hard time listening to the whole cd. I don't know - I guess I was expecting more upbeat and a cd that I just had to listen to. The songs on this Cd are very folkish, and its really hard not to tune them out, and if the lyrics is what makes the songs so funny, if i am tuning them out - i am not listening to the lyrics.I'll still pass the cd along to my collegues - maybe they'll enjoy it more than i did. Overall, nothing great, could have lived without it, not worth much more than 3 stars."
3,It Could Have Been A Five Star,"The CD was great until the last song. The downer of Brandon Moved Away Today ruined the whole tenor of the album. A number of teachers at my school listened to it, and they all had the same reaction."
2,RSVP Endurance Cherry and Olive Pitter,"This pitter is nicely built, but I could not prevent the splatter of cherry juice all over the place. I need a directionally precise, hooded one that will not require the laundering of curtains and clothing after each use."
1,Worthless! The extractor itself got stripped when used.,"Do not buy. One of the extractor got stripped whilst trying to remove a broken screw. The extractor bit just spun inside the screw head, stripping itself instead of embedding itself into the screw for me to remove. Worthless. That should say something about this product."
1,Bad Stuff,"Accusing someone of plagiarism in public is always a difficult issues. In other words, you'd better be pretty damn sure before you say anything. That's why I was so surprised to see the recent review in Harpers claiming that this book was, for all practical purposes, ripped off from a previous Cummings biography (by Kennedy) which is still in print. I won't recap the entire thing here, just issues this review as a warning and suggest you read the May 2005 issue of Harpers. Sawyer-Laucanno, while he wouldn't exactly admit that he stole material from the oprevious book, he did admit that he couldn't explain how the similarities occured... and Sourcebooks also refused to take any responsibility. It's an interesting read, but my advice would be to just go with the original biography by Kennedy since he's the one who seesm to have done all the original research for both volumes."
4,"Fun Toy for the ""Toy Story"" Lover!","My two year old daughter absolutely LOVES ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2""!! My mother had gotten her Buzz and Woody and Slinky Dog previously and so she of course ""needed"" Jessie!! :) We received this on a day she was sick so this brighten her day immediately!! The only downfall to this toy was the hat doesn't really fit her head and the hair was plastic where it should have been yarn as in the movie. Other than that; there is nothing I can say bad about the construction or fun of this toy!! We love it!!"
5,Jesse Doll from Toy Story,Arrived in timely manner. Doll was in perfect shape and my daughter loves having it as part of her collection
3,To young to know the difference,"I bought this for my grandaughter who is 3. She really likes the doll but seldom pulls the string because you can hardly hear Jessie talk. I have to put it right up to my ear to make out what shes saying, and I can hear just fine. I would imagine an older child would be disappointed because she would realized the voice should be louder. Who knows, maybe we got a bum one. I got it for her because she was sick and stuck in the house for a couple of weeks so I didn't dare try and return it. Served the purpose. I also agree that the hat doesn't stay on."
2,Upgrades needed,"I bought the Jessie doll for my daughter's 5th birthday. She loves Toy Story II and seen Jessie at Disney. She loves her.The design of the doll is very close to the one in the movie. My daughter loved it. She talked, confided and cared for the doll like it was human.This lasted for about two months. I think the reason for short attachment is:A) The hat cannot stay on. I wanted to put a dab of glue but my daugther thought it would ""hurt"" JessieB) The hair is plastic and my daughter wanted to know what happend to Jessie's hair. I think a fiber product would do better for the hair.C) The voice box is difficult to understand and hear. It is not very clear and the volume is a bit muffled.D) The exclamations from Jessie should be from what she says in the movie. Children know what they hear and the voice should have the same inflections as in the movie by the original person.I paid a lot of money for this type of toy. It is definetly overpriced."
1,wonderful,This book will bless your life as you read it daily. A friend shared this book with me and I ordered this one for a friend of mine. God is good and we need his strenghth everyday to keep us close to Him. Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
5,God's Grace is amazing,"If you have ever looked for a devotional that brings you closer to our Lord Jesus Christ, than this is the right one.Neil T. Anderson explains what the gospel of grace is all about. It will really set you free from any form of legalism.You will enjoy it if you want to live a life in the full freedom that Christ has provided for you."
4,"Garlock, Almost at her Best!","AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. At last I've found a Garlock book almost as good as ""Annie Lash"" and ""Glorious Dawn"". I say almost, because I just can't find a book to equal my two favorites of all the many Garlock's I have read.One of the reviewers said they thought it was a shame that Letty and Mike could not forgive other's cruel actions toward them, but I believe Garlock stayed true to her characters. Heaven knows, they suffered enough. Personally, I love to see the bad guys get kicked in the butt. Does my old heart good."
5,AT HER VERY BEST,"Dorothy Garlock is my fav. I have read ALL OF HER BOOKS. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAV. It has been a while since I have read this book but it is sooo romantic and wonderful, couldn't put it down!!! I am actually thinking of reading it again. I love when the leads have a history. It adds depth and meaning to the story! HOPE YOU ENJOY AS MUCH AS I DID!!!!"
3,Ribbon In The Sky,A fairly good story in the romance genre.My only problem with the book I received was that it smelled bad. I would have liked to have that in the description that there was an old musty odor to it.
4,Fits the bill nicely.,"This is a lovely pot, ideal for making a small amount of soup or general cooking. A lid would be nice, but I've got others that are usable, if not a perfect fit. All in all, a nice extra pot to have around, and a very nice quality for the price."
5,Unbelievable value,"I also purchased the 1 1/2 quart and 2 quart and have ordered the butter warmer. Even at the suggested retail price they would be a good value. But at the price they are offered by Amazon, it really is unbelievable. Buy now before Amazon realizes they're priced too low!"
5,Insightful work,"Gancarski's book came highly recommended to me, and I opened it with a certain skepticism; after all, the stories of his utter debauchery are legend throughout the Washington area. Nonetheless, I found that The Ganc approached his subject matter with the blistering prose and searing insight of Henry Miller. There are times, however, when he gets beyond irony, hipness, and love of language to write pieces that are at once powerful and beguiling."
1,Anthony Gancarski is a self-important blowhard,"Gancarski is a self-important blowhard who should throw himself off a bridge. When he's not contradicting himself with his myriad of dreamed-up assertions and other assorted flights of fancy which often leave readers asking ""how do i get x-amount of time of my life back after wasting it reading this dickhole?"", the pseudo intellectual, oft-condescending dildonian Gancarski can be found arguing online with other dateless wonders like himself via pro wrestling discussion forums.This book isn't suitable for wiping your arse-piece after even the most heinous of bouts with diarrhea."
4,Autry hits...,"Great stuff, some of it is fairly rare and hard to find. However, there are some crisper recordings of some of these songs. The second CD contains mainly ""western blues"". It is priceless. Overall, a very good find."
4,"Getting used to it, love creating less waste","It does take some thinking ahead for public bathroom visits and hand-washing, but I love using this rather than tampons."
3,"Works, not my fav","The keeper works just fine, but I find it difficult to remove compared to the diva cup. It seems like it's a little more rigid - good for preventing leaking, but significantly less comfortable when removing."
5,I bought the Keeper 10 years ago,"I've been using the Keeper (same one) for 10 years. After having 3 kids, and my last child was over 9 pounds, I do occasionally have some leakage. I also have a tilted uterus. I cut the stem on the Keeper very short, about 3mm left. This has made it more comfortable for my personal shape and size. There are plenty of companies that make cloth panty-liners, so occasional leakage isn't a huge problem. Using the Keeper may take a little practice at first, but don't give up! After using mine for 10 years I'm looking at purchasing a silicon menstrual cup, and when my daughter is older I'll encourage her to try it as well."
5,Best alternative to tampons,"I absolutely love the Keeper Moon Cup!! Not only is it much more environmentally friendly and less expensive in the long run, it's also less painful to use than tampons. If you're thinking about making the switch, I would recommend this one. It's easy to use and comes with a cute storage pouch for it :)"
3,"great for some, but I'm not a huge fan","I'm a 21-year-old student who's had my moon cup for about 2 years. Tampons are really difficult for me to use because of the placement of my cervix, and most pads contain latex which I'm allergic to. Although moon cup says it works with individuals with a tilted cervix, it has not been comfortable for me. Even trimming the stem and experimenting with placement (for 2 years mind you), it is uncomfortable and borderline painful for me to use my moon cup while I'm moving around. However, I often sleep in it. It's never leaked for me even during long nights of sleeping, and I don't experience the pain or discomfort while I'm lying down. You can even sleep naked during your period... who knew? I like sleeping in it much much more than sleeping in anything else. I have a lot of friends who swear by their moon cups and diva cups, however, and some who don't like it much. It's worth trying out, but not always a God-send."
4,Takes some getting used to,"I got the moon cup for environmental reasons. I have a lot of friends who swear by them and thought I should at least give it a try. When first using it, it was a little bit painful and difficult to get in and out. Once inside, I find the seal a little difficult to break. As I have continued to use it, it has definitely become easier and I do not mind using it so much. It creates an excellent seal, there is little to no leaking and it is easy to clean.I think that as I continue to use it I will it will become easier and less uncomfortable. It already has become significantly so after one menstrual cycle.If you are having trouble getting it in, or have other questions, visit the moon cup website for extra assistance. [...]"
5,Brilliant invention!,"This is a healthy, clean, environmentally sound solution. It's a bit weird to use at first, but it's comfortable and easy to insert (although not so easy to remove, for me anyway). Sometimes it does leak a tiny bit, but no more than a tampon. No cancer-causing dioxins to worry about (as in tampons and pads), no odor problems at all. Great for exercise, very convenient--a brilliant invention!"
3,Doesn't hold enough,It's works o.k. I didn't like the package it came in. I think something that you put so close to your body or in it should come sealed in a plastic bag.It was just open with no seal on it. So I had to sterilize it before using. The cup size is not bigger enough for heavy flow. Use only at home or on vaction. Not suitable for an American work enviroment. I only say American work enviroment because the U.S does not have public Bidets. And you have to wash this cup out before you reinsert not to metion yourself because of spilliage.
1,Impossible to use,"... at least for me, anyway. I am new with menstrual cups, so maybe that could change but I found this cup *impossible* to fold down to a small enough size that I could insert it. It was really painful. I have tried the Meluna Soft and Divacup, and those seem to work a bit better for me (although I haven't ""used"" them yet per se, just tried inserting them and it's much easier) so maybe a smaller, softer cup is better for me. The Keeper Moon Cup is also very firm, so I can't imagine how firm the regular Keeper is (although that does mean that the cup pops open easier)Something else I don't like is that this cup does not hold as much fluid as, say, a medium sized Meluna... and Melunas are REALLY small! It's just something I found a bit odd."
2,Hard to use & not worth it,"I ordered this after months of consideration, and I shouldn't have wasted my money or time. It is NOT easy to insert or take out, not even with time--I used for two cycles and it was still painful and uncomfortable to put in and take out (even using the Before Childbirth size). The cup was somewhat difficult to bend and put in, and hurt. Taking it out was even worse--the instructions say to pinch the cup to get it out, but that allows everything to spill out, and it hurt on its way out.Even though it is environmentally conscious and cheaper than pads and tampons over time, I would not recommend this item at all."
5,"Make Your ""time"" more comfortable",Great Product. It takes a few times to get good at inserting but once you have it down it makes your time of the month so much cleaner and easy to deal with. I carry it with me or go ahead and insert it if it is close to my start time. Also can use it in the pool. I still wear pantyliner's because after you urinate it will leak sometimes.I am young. I think any age can use this as long as the size is right.
2,Moon Cup,"I really liked this at first-now I'm not so sure. I find myself using tampons even though I've got this. It is really tough to get in just perfectly so that there are no leaks. Perhaps I haven't figured out the method yet, but I always have to have a pad or liner while I'm wearing this and I don't love that. Because the stem isn't ribbed or textured it can be difficult to take out. The first time, I spent no less than three or four minutes just trying to remove it! I'm glad I have it, but it hasn't been a game changer or anything"
1,SUCKS!,"This was a nightmare. It was extremely difficult to get it in, and extremely painful to take it out! After multiple failed attempts to use it successfully, I gave up and pitched it in the trash. Something should not be so difficult to use."
2,One size DOES NOT fit all,"I am a 28 year old, not a 13 year old. I did not want my name to appear in my review. I bought this because I liked the idea of not having to buy stuff every month and the fact that this would have been a better option for the environment. However, I found the mooncup to be extremely uncomfortable, and very difficult to ""put in"". I really wanted to like it. I gave it a try for a few days, but I would not really recommend it."
4,The Ultimate Colts Fan!,"I have received so many compliments (and offers to buy it!) on this fan! It's one of the coolest Indianapolis Colts items that I own, even more so now that we're the Super Bowl Champions Baby! Too bad there aren't any more on here..."
4,I Bought Two,"I bought 2 of these because of the price ($22 each) and the positive reviews. They came today and I'm really happy. The pleasing shape and the mirror finish make it very attractive for serving at the table. I cooked a big ham and cheese casserole tonight and it cooked evenly with no burned spots. (I'm a very bad cook so this is major for me). It also cleaned up easily since the inside has the mirror finish, too, unlike some lesser stainless steel pans that have the heavily brushed interior finish. The base is thick and heavy but the lid feels a little lightweight. Overall, it's lighter weight than my Calphalon pans but I've noticed that many people prefer cookware that isn't too heavy so this may be just what you're looking for. At $22, I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this covered casserole."
5,very nice piece,Very impressive piece of cookware. Would make an exceptional gift for anyone who loves to cook. High quality as you would expect from Farberware.
4,5-star for $22.50 - but 4-star if priced at $50,I bought one of these to try out for $22.50. It is true that it is a nice casserole dish to cook in and use. It cleans well and looks great. But I would not pay $50 for it since it is rather thin metal and stainless steel. For the price I paid it is well worth it.
2,surprised,"I purchased this item because I liked the size and shape and because the description stated that the based was an aluminum core encased in stainless steel, I believed it would be of the same quality as other similar stainless cookware I own. This cookware is extremely light weight-probably a third the weight of similar sized aluminum clad pans. The quality is absolutely nothing like Cuisinart or Calphalon cookware, although the description is almost exactly the same. It was not expensive and worth it."
2,boaring boaring and boaring,"The book is in black and white print on cheap paper, images are small and low quality, it's almost only text, text, text. The info might be good, but the PATTERNS aren't. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$"
5,Viejitas pero Bonitas!!,Pedro oh Pedrito Fernandez como sea todos sabemos quien es por su gran voz y talento musical. Sus canciones en este album me han hecho recordar los tiempos de cuando mi madre era joven y cantaba cada una de estas canciones. En hora buena Pedro Fernandez sigue adelante y que no muera nuestra musica ranchera.
5,Salute to a genuine folk hero,"Brett Favre is more than just a stellar quarterback in the NFL. He is a genuine folk hero, who embodies the grit, tenacity, hard-won skill, and overwhelming success of the American dream. This entertaining and often poignant look at Favre's life provides insights into what makes this football all-star tick, on and off the field. It also provides some great life keys for success in any endeavor. Hope, hard work, good humor, determination, and resiliancy are great skills to cultivate, and Brett Favre is the embodiment of all of it. Favre is humble but confident, and that tone comes through in his down-to-earth and inspiring story. He's not too proud to reveal his weaknesses, challenges, and stumbles; these issues, rather than diminishing Brett Favre only enhance the sense of appreciation and respect for what he has overcome. If for no other reason, buy this book for Favre's stories about his Dad, which are loving, humorous, and ultimately quite moving."
4,DVD is great. Book is OK.,"Anyone who loves Brett Favre will love the DVD. Anyone who hates Brett Favre will love the DVD! The book is a bit boring, unless you just can't get enough Brett Favre. John Madden will love it. :)"
5,brett farve one of the best QB's in one book,this book is by far one of my favorite books it is very well written and you feal like you are on the field watching brett farve and the packers one of the best books ever i sugest it for any big fan or anyone who just wants to learn about brett farve also a great gift to any big fan.
2,Works but Not Effective,"While the sticky pad had fleas trapped on it, it doesn't get anywhere near enough coverage given you plug it in along one wall but it doesn't work effectively for large rooms or whole house."
2,Not good in bedroom,"I have not seen any effectiveness from this product as it hasn't caught a single critter, but that may just be that I did a good job with cleaning/spraying before using it. That being said, I cannot recommend this as a product to use in the bedroom as the ""nightlight"" is super-powerful and near blinding in my own opinion."
2,didn't work in my house,"The sticky part didn't attach well, which really didn't matter, as there were never any fleas on the pad anyway."
1,do not buy this,This product is an EPIC waste of money and time. It does not work at all!! I feel like i was conned!!
1,They don't work.,I ordered these from Polsteins Home and Beyond and never received them. A friend had one and we used it. Nothing. They are basically a night light with a sticky trap. Not worth it. Home and Beyond has the WORST customer service. I would never order from them again. Ever!
1,Do not spend your money for this Software,"This software has serious memory problems. It can not run smoothly and froze my computer on a regular basis. If you buy, you have to spend time for rebooting your computer."
3,"Works, but not to expectations","This software is theoreticly a well working and ""professional"" one, but has way to many bugs, laggy rates, and freezes consistantly. Small scale, okay. Need something good, I reccomend something else. Plus, the customer service sucks. Absolutely sucks. Never experienced worse in my life."
1,Just don't buy it....trust me,"It just doesn't work up to even a quarter of what you think it will do.When it does work, it takes to to the ""pinnacle"" of a project, then either crashes, won't burn, or will burn with very messy results and will make you very sorry you spent money and time on this piece of garbage."
2,Unable to get past registration page,"I downloaded a free trial version of this product (all 500MB worth) thinking that I could quickly install it and try using it to burn a video file to DVD. The .avi file was previously captured using MS Movie Maker which unfortunately doesn't have a Burn to DVD option. After spending about 30 minutes to install, I tried to start it up. I was immediately greeted with the product registration pages and was unsuccessful in getting past them. It repeatedly prompted for the product name and version, seemingly ignoring what I typed in... After trying about 5 times, I gave up in frustration and ended up uninstalling the whole !$#$@ package. What a piece of crap."
3,Nice to see a farmer in a book like this,"but take the details about farming with a large grain of salt. There's some pretty screwy stuff in there that is just plain wrong, or else done in ways that no farmer would ever do for labor or economic reasons. For example, a milking machine catches on fire when not being used. There's no way a milking machine (singular, you notice) can catch on fire. That's like saying your electric frying pan can catch on fire when it's not plugged in and is sitting on your kitchen counter waiting to get used. The wiring for the system could catch on fire, but that's more than just one machine. It's mistakes like this that prove the author doesn't quite get it. And yes,I'm a dairy farmer. But it's a nice attempt and I'll probably read others in the series just because it does feature a farmer."
2,Large animals are attacted,"This may work fine indoors and away from large animals, however, out of doors is a problem.We have racoons that just go wild trying to get the poison inside the box. They slap it around until it is empty and eat it. As a result, the box is usless to me and the poision expensive."
3,It works,"We unfortunately live adjacent to a river canal. We needed something we could place away from the house (you don't want to know how it is to have a poisoned rat die in your wall) and be difficult for our dogs to break into. This seems to fit the need and since it is refillable, the cost of the station can be amortized over several seasons."
2,no key,"This product is designed to be used with a key. It cannot be opened without the key, which was the exact trouble I encountered.They forgot to ship the key with the product. It was impossible for me to open it. A good concept but also making the product useless if the key is missing or somebody does not want to have to bring a key everytime when he needs to check the station."
3,Bait Not Included,"The station comes WITHOUT bait. The picture shows that there is bait in the box. This is a bit of false representation. I contacted Amazon and they assured me that the item did indicate that it came without bait. IT DOES NOT, the illustration presents the station with the bait set in their places. There must be a notice on the page that the box is empty and thatbait should be purchaed separately.I must add that the opening of the station is next to impossible with this KEY that is provided. It took me many tries and great perservance to get the box opened.The station does provide for a much safer means of elimination the d--m rodents."
3,bait NOT included,"Contrary to what is clearly shown in the Amazon product photos and on the packaging, there is no bait included. Aside from that... yes, it is an injection molded plastic box."
2,Just A Plastic Box,"This arrived without any of the bait that is shown in the ads. Included was a small plastic bag with 4 small metal rods which apparently are intended for use with the misssing bait. Also included was a small piece of metal that is referred to as a ""key"". This is supposedly useful for opening the plastic box. After numerous unsuccessful thrusts at the plastic box with the ""key"" I was torn between using a sledge hammer or a pickaxe. However, I decided to go with a small pry bar which worked quite well. Not having received the pictured bait and having read the review that racoons can remove it from the plastic box I decided to use bait trays that are larger than the openings in the plastic box. A wise racoon, of course, although unable to remove the bait tray can still shake out the bait itself.So, I am left with a falsely advertised black plastic box, a non-workable ""key"" and a tray full of bait which can be shaken out. Wow! What a deal!"
1,Pump has very low pressure,I lost the box or I would have sent this back. It is not worth the money. The flow is poor. My mistake! I had a 3GPM that was too much so I chose a 2 GPM. This pump is probably a 1/2 or 1 GPM pump. I use this on my tractor to water my plants and add fertilizer. I wanted a low flow pump so it wouldn't destroy the plants but this is way too low.
4,Good,"Kind of like a picture encyclopedia. Beautiful color pictures. It's nice to find a book that doesn't focus on the war problems. A bit more on the history of the actual people from Lebanon would be helpful, not ""whose occupied it"" in the past. Overall, very general, not terribly descript."
4,"Cute cats, cute calendar",My mother loves getting her cat calendar each year. This calendar has never failed to bring a smile to her face. Very well packaged and put together...
3,on time,"Arrived as scheduled, but I have always had a scoop that fits inside coffee can, and this one is too long."
1,reader in NYC,"A timely and fascinating treatment of issues relating to ecstasy usage, both recreational and as a tool for therapy. However, the book's ""scientific"" authorship are precisely what makes the book dangerous in that it seems to promote drug abuse as safe, although when read closely the data does not appear to support this conclusion so clearly. Perhaps the jury is still out on long-term adverse effects of MDMA. When the drug in question has potential to alter and damage neural structures of today's youth, perhaps a more cautious approach is in order. A great read, but the authors' presupposition of the drug's safety appears unfounded, even given information cited."
1,reader from Boston,"A provacative, thought-inspiring work which focuses on timely and important topics. However, the danger exists that this book in presenting itself as a ""scientific"" work will promote drug use. While many chapters were fascinating, the book's overall premise seems to be that moderate MDMA usage is without potential adverse effects. I found data supporting this premise to be largely lacking from this book. Maybe such data is not available, but if not, how can the authors' be so sure long-term, moderate usage of this substance is safe? Perhaps the jury is still out."
4,"Rich Breakfast Tea, NOT LOOSE LEAF","I've recently fallen in love with Irish Breakfast tea, and due to the rave reviews, purchased the Lyons Brand. The tea did not disappoint me. It was full bodied and delicious; because it's from tea dust not leaves, you don't have to steep it for a long time, a few minutes will do, unless you like it dark of course. I give it the four because of the false advertisement that it is loose leaf, plus it was not well packaged. Tea dust were all over the box. I will be trying the Yorkshire Gold tea next, hearing great things about it."
1,agravated,"I'm un-plesed with this, I just got a macbook pro and last week I updated it from 10.5 to 10.7 version, as soon as I pressed ""download"" It wouldn't allow me. I went to the apple store and they told me that it is the softwear not my computer and that aspyr lost the rights to have this is 10.7 but I was still really confused because i also just got the Sims 2 Seasons and that downloaded perfectly fine, so this game was a total waste of money."
4,Super Fun!!,"As always the Sims games are super fun! I now own Sims 3 but I still have a place in my heart for Sims 2 as it seems to me a bit easier to play and has a lot less glitches and loads a lot faster. The university expansion is awesome, i loved getting my sim to university and studying as well as doing the whole party thing :o)"
4,It made my Sim experience more fun,"Most expansion packs stress me out, but this one added to the fun. Some of the objectives were kind of too much to accomplish while trying to ""go to school"", but all in all perty darn fun."
1,Buggy and unplayable,"Sims 2 for Mac runs great on my iMac G5, but my new copy of the Sims 2 University expansion pack won't run at all! I have a feeling this product was rushed out the door in an attempt to get it into stores in time for the holidays, and it's not quite fully tested and debugged. The game will not run at all on my iMac -- the University loads, but freezes up and ""time"" never starts. If any other users report the same problem, I would recommend avoiding this product until the next patch or update is released. It otherwise looks like it would be a lot of fun --too bad!"
4,worth it,"so, i go through phases with the Sims. the advent of Sims 2 pulled me in yet again, and i finally splurged for University. have to say, it was worth it.you can pull teenage sims from your main game and send them to college, or you can develop your own sims in the university mode. you can build your own university, you have an ""influence"" meter that encourages you to develop your sim's social skills in order to exert more influence over others, and (while never enough) the new objects/building add-ons are fun.hardware-wise, i'm running on a iMac G5, and the game (while slow-ish to load) runs perfectly. as usual, though, when in a community lot the game tends to be a bit sluggish."
4,Good game,"It's a pretty fun game, thank God, Mac is growing in the sense of good games. It runs perfectly, and actually faster than the pc I had... Only problems is that is a pretty repetitive expansion pack, but, to be honest when you graduate, everything starts to be fun and less repetitive (especially with the coming nightlife expansion) and there's always the option of donwloading hacks for it. I highly recommend it to every ""Sims 2"" and Mac fan, as me."
1,Poor quality - do not buy,"This table was not packaged very well and one of the crossbars below a lazy susan was cracked. The overall quality of the table is very poor, one lazy susan was not level with the table, the joints are all screwed together and only made to somewhat look like true wood joinery. We returned the table after one week. I suggest paying a little more elsewhere and getting a better quality table."
4,Thought provoking and hauntingly rich!,"Bic Runga has indeed captured the essence of a true artist. In an age where many artists (entertainers) no longer write their own music, Bic Runga has emerged as a true artist in the purist sense. When I heard the song ""Sway"" I was eagered to hear more of her work. (not disappointed) The album is incredible. She has an incredible gift!"
5,"It's really good, it's like Jeff Buckley.","I think that with they various styles of music on the album it is definately one of the best ones I've heard in a long time. I really think really think that her style of expression is similar to Jeff Buckley but there is a bit or Tori amos in there too. I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it the only disappointing thing is that she probably won't be touring outside New Zeland. Not to worry, anyway it's really good and I think that anyone who likes good singing and easy listening music should buy it."
3,go kiwi girl!!,"Although 'Drive' wasnt exactly my cup of tea album-wise, congrats have to be given to Bic....she has tirelessly toured NZ (where I saw her in Nelson), and is now busy breaking into the US market. She is very talented, and I hope she gets the success she deserves overseas. Good on ya!! :)"
4,"Great record, pitty she's not bigger in Ireland","I first heard the song sway about one and a bit years ago and I was quite a bit impressed. However I only heard it a few times due to the change-over of MTV Europe to MTV UK. Then a short while ago I stumbled across a Bic Runga website by accident. I listened to the albumb soundbites and was once again impressed. Then post-haste I purchased the albumb at my local retailer and lived happily ever after. This albumb is impressive in many ways. Its contemporary style mixed with Jeff Buckley-esque influences makes it one of the best debut albumbs I've heard in years. With stand out tracks like Sway, Roll into one and Suddenly Strange it gives you the confidence to listen to the more experimental tracks towards the end of the record. These tracks also give you the feeling that her next albumb will have a more experimental approach and I cant wait for it. Oh yeah , the first song ""drive"" is also quite groovalicious. Great albumb. Four stars."
2,"For those who liked ""Torn""","I've seen a couple people online who have compared Bic Runga to Beth Orton, but I don't hear much similarity between them at all. Bic reminds me of nobody so much as Natalie Imbruglia. If you liked ""Torn,"" here's more of the same. If that song got on your nerves, consider yourself warned."
3,Didn't work at first. I had to bend the socket first,"I bought these and planned to return them. The bulb wouldn't screw in! This is pretty basic quality control and it is lacking here. After twisting the sockets, I finally got them to work."
5,Excited reader,This is a book that will help everyone to learn how to handle every situations and circumstances that life may throw our way.You will definately learn how to hang up your hang-ups!
3,Contact seller first!,"My star rating is meaningless, because I did not receive the product. BUT:As you probably noticed, this page contains images of both rain pants and tee-shirts. If you plan to order either from this site, I recommend contacting the seller first! Because the title says PreCip pants, I assumed that was what I was ordering; but I ended up with a tee-shirt.Save yourself the time and hassle of making a return, and make sure you and the seller both know what you're buying."
5,Great album,Herd this album being played at a siminar I attend. Knew I had to have a copy for myself. I love this music.
3,Columbine,After my order it came fast. But watching it. It couldve been more detailed. I was hoping for more facts in the shooting then it stated.
3,Some interesting information,"Some of the actual footage during Columbine is shown in this movie. Not outstanding information, but interesting to watch."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Having really liked Joy's first release ""Angeltown"", I eagerly picked up this album. While not bad, I would recommend listening to this before buying it, if you liked ""Angeltown""."
1,Code 10 - means no joy,"Will not even start up to go through the hardware installer under XP. May be my PCMCIA controller (Sony Vaio), but bottom line is it doesn't work with my laptop and is therefore useless to me."
3,Not unless you need 4 USB ports,"It is an ""OK"" product, but you might try the two port model ZUN2200 by Zonet. Micro Innovations makes good products, but I found the four port was difficult to get all the way into the PCMCIA slot."
5,El Leon de la Salsa at His Best,"Oscar D'Leon LOVES to perform live and you can practically hear his huge grin and energy in every song on this CD. The crowd goes wild at the first notes of ""Lloraras"" and you will too, even if you've never seen him jumping around and dancing on stage until the sweat comes pouring down his shiny head. He's a blast! All of his songs are truly salsa at its best, and with two fabulous CDs together, you're sure to find the songs you're looking for like ""Lloraras"" and ""Me Voy Pa' Cali"". They did a great job of editing out all the unnecessary noise and applause that usually go with a live CD too, so this is a real winner. En Vivo is definitely the best of El Leon de la Salsa!"
3,solo hay un sonero mayor,"Oscar D Leon has earned his own merits and does not need to take, or steal a title from anyone dead or alive, but the truth is there is and always be only one sonero mayor and that is ISMAEL RIVERA. And he didn't call himself that. The great Benny More called him that after hearing him sing. Another thing is that Andy Montanez has been doing his thing way before Oscar D Leon even came into the scene. And Andy is EL Maestro Sonero ask any salsero and they will tell you that. But to the real issue here , this is a good recording and Oscar jams. The sound is excellent and the two cd's are well worth the price. I only wished Oscar would have included some of his recent hits."
2,OSCAR D LEON LIVE,"Oscar D Leon 's new CD is a very good compliation of his hits recorded LIVE at the famous NY nite club, the Copacabana. Many of Salsa legends such as Andy Montanez, Cheo Filiciano,El Gran Combo, etc, have performed here. Oscar makes the listner imagine being there live. In this CD, Oscar plays tribute to cuban legend Benny More whom he says was his influence in the track' Que bueno baila usted', and he also plays tribute to someone whom he doesn't really want to admit to the great puerto rican sonero Andy Montanez in the track 'A MI MANERA'. This is not the first time Oscar has sung one of Andy's signiture song. It's time Oscar came clean and admit that Andy truly is ""EL REY DE LOS SONEROS''."
3,Good but there is a problem.,"I enjoyed the book. I will defer to the opinion of Besterholic as to how this fits in with other material by Bester; to me it seems to be enjoyable science fiction.My primary motivation for writing this reviewing is that the book is actually flawed. The edition I have, which has the same cover as that displayed here, has been very poorly edited. There are numerous examples of misplaced punctuation, as well as lack of breaks between dialogue between two characters, etc.I have never seen a book with so many obvious errors; the publishers really ought to fix it. (One almost suspects the typesetting was done with voice recognition software to save money, but without adequate follow-up editing.)"
4,Decent low-carb option,"All in all the blueberry muffins were good. They are not super-sweet like many store or cafe bought muffins, but they were still yummy. The texture is soft and fluffy, not cardboard. It was nice to have these as a low-carb treat.The only negative is that the package only makes 11-12 small muffins at 4 carbs each (1 muffin is a serving). I used the standard cupcake sized silicon baking cups and only got 11 with none of them baking any higher than the top of the cups. One won't fill you up enough to have as breakfast by itself, but they make a great snack in the afternoon or paired with some berries for desert."
3,Taste Great,"The muffins taste great, the only reason they received 3 instead of 5 stars is they are a bit pricey. However if you are craving some low-carb muffins these are a great choice!"
3,The muffins were a pleasant low carb treat,As the subject said the muffins were a pleasant low carb treat. I would by them again.
2,A disappointment in taste,"I made the fat-free version of these muffins according to the directions on the package. The batter tasted good and they baked up really nicely. However, they have a very strange texture and a weird chemical aftertaste. I only ended up eating 2/12 and felt guilty even trying to give the rest away to a bunch of 20-year old college guys. Sadly, I can't recommend them. I generally love low cal subs, but this one sadly doesn't cut it."
3,Hard-to-See Classic,"Any film fan should see this evocation of an obsessed trapeze artist, and Emil Jannings captures a man in the clenches of his own obsession. The camera work by Karl Freund is spectacular. The Blue Angel does a better job with the cuckold story. Even though the retaliation doesn't come at the expected moment, it arrives without the impact it needs."
1,Unfortunately Not Yet An Acceptable Digital Version,"While this film is one of the classics from the German silent film era, for some unaccountable (to me) reason, it has never been released (or renovated) in a watchable DVD version. And this is no exception. It is a terrible transfer. Especially inexcusable when so many better quality film versions exist from which an acceptable transfer could have been made."
4,Charming social history/memoir,I found this story charming and enlightening regarding the Jewish immigrant experience in NYC in the 1930's. I came to love the characters and was sad when the book ended because I felt like I knew the characters personally. I loved the way the author combined a partial memoir and a social history of the times. Definitely worth reading or giving as a gift. Would make a great movie!
3,Great immigrant story,"Great immigrant story, starting with one determined woman and spanning several generations."
5,Wonderful music!,Noel Web is simply the best. I heard a cut from this disk on the radio and had to have it. The sound is wonderful.
5,Derrida Deconstructed,"Caputo is one of the great modern writers. There may be better philosophers, but Caputo is a fine communicator. This book is no exception. While I have always been fascinated by Derrida, I have found much of his work impenetrable. But Caputo has built bridges of understanding, so that something of Derrida's genius is open to all. The lay out of the book, along with Caputo's lucid style, greatly assists the project. Thanks to Caputo, the postmodern notion of ""deconstruction"" makes good sense. For example, Caputo's discussion on Derrida's understanding of ""community"" is very helpful. So, if you want to see what all the fuss is about in relation to Derrida, then Caputo's book is one for you."
3,Not good for the ram van,"good quality pulley that does not secure entirely in the ram van, opt for one of the smooth pulleys with a metal outside over this rubber grooved pulley"
5,I wish I had it sooner.....,I just recieved this book from my father-in-law for Christmas along with two other homeschooling books. This is our first year unschooling/homeschooling and I often wonder if my children are learning all they should. They are!!!!! I just wish I had this book at the beginning of the year. Atleast I WILL have it at the beginning of NEXT year.
5,"A Little Overwhelming, but Great Info","My firstborn is in Kindergarten this year and I was a bit surprised by the stuff this book recommended he learn. Some of it seems a little advanced, like counting by 2s, 5s and 10s, knowing ordinal numbers, etc. I'm sure he's capable of it, but that didn't strike me as K curriculum.That being said, it's very useful to have all this info on hand. The resources are pretty good, though I'm doing a lot of my own research, too. The sheer amount of information in this book is a bit overwhelming, so I recommend sticking to just the grades you'll be teaching!"
4,A Wealth of Information,"I have to admit I was stressed out originally when I read this book. It has SO MUCH information that you can very easily put pressure on yourself as a homeschooler. I homeschool both my children (7 & 6) and I want to be certain that I'm not leaving any ""holes"" in their education. The first year I literally tried to do EVERYTHING! I know, lame right? My kids and I were pulling our hair out! This year I wised up and realized that this book is a GUIDE, it gives suggestions.I recommend this book wholeheartedly, just remember that you cannot do everything!"
5,Must have for homeschooling,"I am a first time homeschooler. My son is in the first grade. When it came to doing my IHIP I was struggling. The NYS Department of Education is very vague, and the school was no help. This book saved me. I borrowed it from my local library and now don't want to return it!"
5,Good Complement,"This is a great book for building your confidence in what you are doing. Practical and illuminating. Since I am just starting our with Kindergarten, this book is a great resource for ensuring that I am covering all of the bases."
4,Very Informative,"I found this book to be very informative. It also had some terrific tips and resources for Moms who are new to homeschooling or even Moms who have been at it awhile. The only reason I was disappointed was that I thought the book actually taught you how to build your own curriculum, where to start and what the steps were. Other than that, it was a terrific book. Everybody I talked to about homeschooling books recommends this one."
1,Waste of Time,"Starting homeschooling my 4, 8 & 6 year olds and was wondering what to teach when they need to learn things and where can I find this information. This book did not contain that information is lists books and other information that you can find your self online or in basic homeschooling books. So its just sitting on my shelf collecting dust."
4,Love this book; was in great shape,"I believe that the book was pretty much as described. There were a few small marks on some of the pages, other than that...it was in great condition. Glad I finally ordered this book"
2,Not impressed,"I opened this book with anticipation, as it seemed like a great concept. As a Christian home educator, however, I was disappointed. Many of the recommendations in the book are not especially helpful to those whose goal is to raise children with a Biblical world view. It's not that the recommendations are for ""bad"" things, but neither are they for distinctly Christian resources. For those who are not Christians, this may be a very good resource for you, but I will not recommend this book to other Christian home educators."
4,Home Learning Year To Year,I have been homeschooling for two years and this book has really help me. I can look up information on each grade level to see just what each grade should or could be learning for their level.If putting together your only curriculm this is a very helpful book.
3,A decent starting point,"I'm not a huge proponent of developing your own curriculum, but this book does provide a good starting point if that's what you plan to do.As a homeschool graduate and a homeschooling mom, I would only recommend this book as a resource guide. It's much better suited to being a resource list than being the definitive guide on creating your own curriculum. If you follow the author's suggestions for what your child needs to know (and especially if you delve too deeply into each topic) you'll likely suffer homeschool burnout quickly. If you use the book to find resources to round out your course of study, you'll probably be more satisfied with this book's offering."
4,Home Learning Year by Year: How to Design a Homeschool Curriculum from Preschool Through High School,"I haven't had the chance to use this book much, but so far it seems like a great resource. Alot of the books they site as resources can be found at the library - so if you are on a budget like me and don't want to have to buy alot of textbooks, this book is great. My kids will be in the first grade and preschool this year, so we are pretty new to homeschooling and this book gives me a good idea as to what I need to be teaching and at what level my child should be at in each subject. Right now the only textbooks we own are ones for math and reading and I am supplementing with books from the library and worksheets off the internet. Anyway, this book is a bargain and if you don't want to buy a $1000 curriculum, this is the way to go! I gave this four out of five because I haven't used it for long and I haven't really put it to use."
4,Awsome Reference!!!,If you want to build your own curriculum or just want to know what your kids need to know for each grade than this is your book!
1,Really Out Dated...Not Worth the Price...,"Got this book on kindle...I am homeschooling my youngest brother and needed some help with core subjects, read books, etc ...I should have payed closer attention to the 1 and 2 Star reviews.It is REALLY outdated and in my opinion it is NOT worth the $13.99 price...I am asking for a refund."
4,Great resource for homeschooing parents,"This book is wonderful. It eased my fears about short changing my homeschooler or overlooking some educational aspect. while offering so much information. I like that it offers guidelines on where your child should be but remember that these are guidelines and you may want to check with your state's requirements.Also, I agree with the reviewer who said that some of the resources/info may be a bit dated-hence the four stars. (Looking forward to a revised edition.) Don't forget to look for online resources as well. For example: [...] is helpful for kids learning to read.Another thing that I appreciated was its reference-type, secular feel. I highly recommend this book whether just starting out or well into homeschooling."
1,Different but not in a good way,"After his excllent two late ninteties albums ,Chico Debarge returned with his with solo album Free. Debarge abaoned the likes of JOE for self production. I thought for sure after hearing Player Hater back in 2000 that this would be a more contermpoary album which sadly it isn't."
1,a miracle chico has'nt overdosed yet,don't worry el's just been arrested and he's cracked out only a matrer of time when another member of the debarge family passes.
1,WEAK EFFORT!,Chico just lost a fan. He tried to write and produce this album on his own and it's terrible. Chico has the voice and looks but he needs to get some Proven or even good Producers and Songwriters. I WAS a big fan.
4,Seductively Free,"Hence the title, Free. More that just a song on this cd that says he's okay with the freedom he has with being independent now with his own label. Just as the song said ""It's Cool,"" Chico is just that. No hippy-hop tracks just real r&b. This is definately an ice breaker for someone you've just met and invited them over (fellas take heed.) For if you are looking for something aside from the usual tunes that are on heavy rotation on the radio, then this is for you. Chico is uplifting, positive and conscience of society and just simply being a man. Heartfelt and compassioniately written, produced and performed by Chico. This will set you free after a long day at work!"
4,Soul with sweat,"Chico Debarge is not your average R&B singer. He's been partnered with powerhouse Joe on this album as well as past cd's. However his style of soul music is more along the lines of Maxwell or D'Angelo. His voice, song-wrtiting and songcraft evoke Marvin Gaye with a modern day swagger. This album is a slow burner, but once the atmosphere of the cd seeps into your ear drums, it takes you to a place few R&B artists today dare to take you. Definitley worth picking up if you appriciate strong artisty in today's R&B."
1,the sh*t(s),"To be absolutely truthful, I haven't heard this type of crap since jon b. If u want to buy an expensive coaster this isnt for you. This album is a waste of money, time and cds. If you want to listen to this music you might as well bootleg it rather than payin $9.99. The tunes on this album ""home alone"" and ""no guarentees"" are terrible and the guy cant sing to save his life."
4,A Must Buy...,"I really enjoyed this long overdue album. Especially track 2 entitled Free. I have all of his previous albums, and would have to say if you are into the Neo-soul sound, then you will love this album. It is a combination of slow ballads, with a couple nice uptempo songs such as (Home Alone and Not Together). Be sure to go out and purchase this album, you won't be disappointed"
2,Pretty Average,"I've followed Chico Debarge's Career for a while&""Long time no See"" thus far is His Artistic Peak to me.this Album shows Growth from his Writing but Musically Sounds like most of the things He has already done much difference in His Overall Arrangements.He is a Pretty Good Singer but never quite FOund His Range overall like His Brothers Bobby&El.Vocally He is about neck&Neck with James.""Smile"" is a Cool Cut."
4,Inacurate info.,"This is NOT Chico's sophmore album, technically it's his 5TH album/cd, prior to the great one that included no guarantees, etc. he released 2 albums, then Chico and his brother James were in prison for selling drugs for approximately 10 years, thus the title 'Long time, no see' and all the videos with a prison back drop. He released 'The Game' after that which really only had a couple of decent songs and I am anxiously waiting to hear what this one sounds like! I rated it a 4 only so I could post this correction to an earlier post."
3,"Mmmm, not a ""Chico Original""","Yeah.. well.. This is not like any other album of Chico DeBarge. He totally left the R&B a side... and focused completely on Neo-Soul. If you're a fan of this genre, this album is worth checking out. Only the track 'Free' brings you back to the ol' Chico DeBarge."
4,Chico's done it again,"I am a big fan of Chico Debarge he always delivers that sexy soul sound. He is a great artist that really puts his heart and soul into his music. His music has lots of meaning in it, and so cool to vibe to. I would highly recommend anyone to listen to Chico and the rest of the Debarge family. They have been putting out great music for years and I would consider them one of the best musical families to ever do it. Good music never gets old."
3,Heavy!,"Well-made 'hawk, cuts and pounds well, but HEAVY! So much so that it's fatiguing to use, and not something I'd want to carry far. I'd rather swing a lighter hawk, more times. The hawk is well made - no complaints there - but I find myself choking up on the handle for much of my time with it. It tries to be 100% ax, 100% hammer... and is. But the cost is weight, which for me is excessive. I also have a Trail Hawk, which I can swing forever and, although it doesn't chop quite as fast as this, the difference is not so great as to make it a problem. The Norse Hawk (i also own one of those) is also an equivalent chopper and doesn't fatigue me like this one."
2,Not the best,"I had read other reviews of this product which said that it was a better tomahawk and the head wouldn't come off. Not correct. The head came off on the third throw. You can put it back on and tap it down, but it came off again two throws later. I expected better performance based on other reviews."
3,3.5 stars,"Handle is nice and long, head is heavy, but feels good. Blade is good and sharp and with the weight of the blade and handle length this is a very effective camping/ outdoor tool. Fit is not great, which is the reason for three stars. Head was looseish on arrival and slid down the handle after very little use. Some tips on how to fix that in reviews. Haven't tried them yet, but looking forward to getting this thing fixed and back in action."
2,tomahawk,"Very dissapointed this item was made in China, head was loose on the handle had to reset the head. Would not buy again or recommend for purchase."
2,Broken Handle,I bought this for my father a few months ago. It seemed to be pretty solid but after his second throw at a wood target the handle broke in two. The inside of the handle was a bit pithy. He made himself a new handle from a stronger wood so hopefully he won't have this happen again so soon. He really likes the hawk over all. Maybe they just had a bad shipment of wood...
3,A small ax,"This by my understanding is not a tomahawk. Its an ax. It's to much to carry on the hip and the head is not small enough to be combfortable for small combat tactics. It is a very nice ax head shape though it falls short as an ax due to the line stright handle. If your a big guy (6ft 4in and like 200 lb) then this could work for you as a tomahawk, but for my 6ft 150 its just not gonna work."
3,Reenactor Review,"Head was painted insted of blued, needed to be stripped and blued to be authentic looking! A good piece to start out with."
1,no good,i run a survival school and this pot metal piese of junk came apart 1st day out just hamering tent stakes and hamer head just snaped there custamer sevice wont replase it
2,Poor Quality Control,"Don't waste your money. Poor quality control means you won't know what you'll get until it arrives. Mine has a long chip down the handle and a very loose, poorly fitting head."
4,Good 'Hawk,"Recently got this hawk, good balance and overall nice. I'm not a thrower, it's more utilitarian for me. I like it, I've sharpened the edge a bit and it works like a dream."
4,Great New Music,"I bought the CD and I think it is great. Once I heard ""Crazy For This Girl"" on the radio, I had to go out and buy the CD. If you like Vertical Horizon you will like this CD as well. The music is very catchy and I listen to it everyday. I suggest it greatly. I love it."
5,I love these guys!!,I have been and Evan and Jaron fan since I lived in Atlanta back in 1995. I am so glad that the rest of the world can finally hear the music I have loved for so long!
5,Two of the most talented people I have ever heard,"What do you get when you put twin brothers in the studio who write their own songs and play their own insturments?You get one amazing CD.I am really in love with Evan and Jaron's CD.I find the songs very well sung and very well written.There is more to this CD then just ""Crazy For This Girl"".The songs ""Ready Or Not"",""Make It Better"",""Outerspace"",and ""Done Hangin On Maybe"" are fun pop songs that should be released as singles.Balads like ""The Distance"" and ""You Don't Know Me"" are so much better than any pop ballad out there.If you are sceptical about buying this CD you shouldn't be because it is amazing.A must have for anyone."
5,If you think this CD is good...,"...then you need to check out their previous CD, ""We've Never Heard of You Either."" I've been listening to these guys for years and their music never gets old. Each soulful strum of the guitar stikes a chord in your heart. This is definitely a CD you can hit Random on, and just sit back and listen without skipping any tracks. If you like songs in which you feel the singer is singing about your life, get this CD."
5,Refreshing in a world overrun by boybands...,"There is hope for music! Evan and Jaron are really, truly musicians (which is hard to find nowadays). All I hear on the radio is that bubblegum crap that everyone likes. Then...one day, I heard ""Crazy for this Girl"". I wasn't thoroughly impressed until I heard the piano solo. From there, I went from mildly impressed to extremely impressed. These boys are really artists! I bought their CD and found that all of the songs are unbelievable. Evan and Jaron are often accused of being boyband wannabes. This couldn't be farther from the truth. They 1) have class (I met them once at a show...they were incredibly nice). 2) They are unbelievable live. All these boybands and pop princesses lip sync...E&J do acoustic shows and nail harmonies like nobody else. 3) They write beautiful songs. These songs are filled with emotion and meaning. They are a true joy to listen to! Anyways, I strongly suggest this CD. You won't regret it!"
4,Great Debut From These Twins,"When I first heard ""Crazy For This Girl"" on the radio, I thought of it as a pleasant pop hit and thought nothing more of it. One day at the cd shop, I saw the album at a good price and decided to pick it up. I am very pleased that I purchased this cd. The twins are soulful in their lyrics and captivate their fans with catchy hooks and strong bridges.Standouts on the cd include the hit ""Crazy For This Girl"" as well as ""Done Hangin' On Maybe,"" ""Distance,"" ""Pick Up The Phone,"" and ""From My Head To My Heart.""If You are a fan of John Mayer or matchbox twenty, you will definitely like this cd. It was a pleasant surprise for me and could be as well for you if you pick up this album."
2,Evan and Jaron,"I listened to this Cd and just want to say that I am SO tired of all pop bands sounding alike. These two guys are obviously talented and have a folksy, country sound, but their songs sound identical to 3rd eye blind and googoo dolls and many other similar pop bands. I found this CD very disappointing."
1,non-functional timepiece,We charged the watch for 4 days and it only ran for 6 hours. We tried repeatedly to charge it and it repeatedly stop after a few hours.
1,Eco-Drive has design fault,"I bought a eco-drive stiletto, man's watch in India. This watch looses around 2 minutes in 15 days. The company tried twice in repairing the watch without any success. I am still fighting with the company to refund my money.Company response (or rather lack of it) is really bad."
2,Depressing!,"The woman in this book, Nan, seems to love her husband so why would she just take off like that?Her life wasn't so bad to begin with. Sure, she couldn't always do what she wanted to, but that's the way life is. Especially if you are married. It's give and take. Maybe she should have spoken up more and told her husband what she wanted instead of splitting.This book made me feel sleepy and depressed."
4,Berg fan here!,I've read every book by Elizabeth Berg and I've loved every one...this didn't disappoint. She beautifully captures the human experience in well-crafted language and plot...I eagerly anticipate her new work.
4,For any woman who has longed for the unknown...,"A great little gem, easy and fast read. I love everything by Elizabeth Berg, and you will too, she has an incredible way of letting you into the head of her characters.. you will find yourself saying, ""Oh my God, I DO that!"" or ""Man do I recognize that reaction!"" A remarkable writer..."
3,tiresome narrator,"This novel is not without merits in its insight into the thoughts of a woman as she confronts her aging, her past and her future. However, Berg alternates between entries into a journal the narrator begins keeping and letters the narrator is writing to her husband and, in so doing, overwhelms the reader with the narrator's internal monologue. The narrator became tiresome, neurotic and whining as the book and her trip wound on."
1,Too much free time,"My book club discussed this book. The women under 40 (including me) hated it, found the main character vain, over-indulged and useless. The women over 40 all liked the book and understood the main character. The women over 50 said it was the story of their own lives.Maybe it's a generational thing? I couldn't stand the main character. I couldn't understand why she allowed herself to get into the rut she was in, why she didn't do something sooner and why she didn't do something constructive instead of taking a roadtrip.I wonder how everyone would respond if this story was about a man who decided one day that he was bored with his life and his wife and wanted to find some adventure. He then proceeds to write letters to his wife from the road in which he details his sexual exploits with women he meets on the road. ..."
4,Modern-day Housewife adventure makes good,"A woman in the midst of mid-life crisis decides to up and leave her husband of many years and find out what's on the other side of the white picket fence. During the course of her journey she sends letters back to her husband and keeps a journal of her more private thoughts and experiences, and this is the meat of the tale.Unveiled are women's issues and fears at the starkest and most accesible; Berg writes like an old friend talks, and the book flies from one adventure to the next, leaving behind just enough sugar to keep you following her ehroine's trail. Some of it seems a little contrived, but who cares? It's a modern day housewife adventure that could happen to any woman at anytime (it's charm), complete with stops in backwater cafes, bed-and-brekafast cribs and trailer parks. A delight, and just the right length."
5,wonderfully written by a soul mate,A brief period of time in a changing womans life Leaving her home and husband to find the self she forgot for so long. A great read.
2,Greatly disappointed,"i have read almost all of Elizabeth Berg's books,and loved every one of them. I picked this book up from a stack of my ""security books"" I keep around between library check-outs. In spite of being an enthusiastic reader of ""women's fiction"",I was embarrassed by the ""sappy"" nature of this book. Nan would have accomplished much more by volunteering and giving back than giving in to her self-absorbed nature. I would like to know her husband's reaction when she returned!"
5,This book is about being a woman and being human.,"I loved this book. It was very sensitive, perceptive, almost poetic and all about life. This woman sees things that we take for granted every day and is grateful for these little (and not so little) things. Highly recomended and very readable. I will now go on to some of her other books and hope they come as close as this one to being memorable."
4,A Little Gem!,"This book is a little gem. It is a novel written in the form of journal entries and letters from a fifty year-old woman to her husband as she is making the journey away from life and her loved ones, towards death.Gradually, through introspection and imaginary contact with the people she's met on her life's travels, she becomes at peace with herself and her life. She is then able to let go. As she lets go she comes home, metaphorically and in fact.I recommend this book."
4,Beautifully written,"This is a perfect novel for women ""of a certain age"". Elizabeth has a way with language and turning a phrase that's so crystal clear. She brings humor and tenderness and a attention to fine details of everyday life to the surface. She makes you take a more detailed look at your life and all it's quirks and tiny miracles. Love this book and love Elizabeth Berg! I will continue to read everything she graces the world with!"
4,Interesting,"If you are anywhere near 50 years of age, and a woman, you will find this book interesting. It really hits home on many subjects. It seems as though this may have been a bit autobiographical. Fast read."
3,Pull Yourself Out of It!,"I always enjoy Elizabeth Berg's writing, but Nan is a spoiled, pampered darling. I'm the author of a book that inspires mothers (NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL), so I'm definitely for women asking for and getting what they want. I'm also aware that women tend to ""disappear"" as we age, so I can fully relate to many of Nan's concerns. It's just that her tale is so unlikely and her resources so unlimited and her ""real"" life so cushy that it's hard to accept her as a real person with a real problem."
3,"Easy read, whiny, yet inspirational?","I was ready for a fast reading book and this definitely fit the bill. I don't regret reading it, I enjoyed it but can't rate it too highly. As others have said, the main character in this book, Nan, is a bit whiny but it was in sort of a regretful way. I enjoyed some of her insights that I felt epitomize half the regrets women verbalize while I sit quietly, wanting to wring their necks. It bothers me when people whine about their husbands holding them back and not being ""supportive"". So if that is the type of person you are, this book serves as an inspirational writing. Start doing the things you have always wanted to do or stop whining about it. If you like driving the back roads, then do it now and then so you don't get to a crisis stage in your life. So, this book is primarily about a woman who breaks down in order to take more charge in her life. Let it inspire you!"
2,Thirty Years Too Late,"This forgettable modern tale of a woman who wanders away from home looking for ""she doesn't know what"" and ending with her rather laughable attempt to bond with the earth by lying on it, uncomfortably, overnight, would have seemed more relevant and maybe even more believable, 30 years ago. The heroine is much too gentle and satisfied a character to be seeking her ""enlightenment."""
2,Wouldn't it be nice....,if we could take off whenever we wanted and have access to funds to support our trip?Most people wish to be:Financially secureHave a loving spouseBeautiful (but too large) homeLoving DaughterWhat is she complaining about?Nan can afford therapy. Get some and move on.
1,"nice author, superficial work","... I attempted to read two or three of Elizabeth's books but couldn't get into any of them. They all seemed superficial and full of fluff. The characters are not fully drawn and it's hard to care for any of them, they are not ""real"". It's all whiny dialogue, as if the lines came from her journal entries. Ther's no metaphor, no prose, no stirring of emotions. To me it was the equivalent of eating junk food-it fills you up but doesn't nourish you. I like books that make you think and wonder and care about life, not just something you ""read"" and forget about as soon as you put the book down...."
1,"rich, self-centered, privileged female whining","This book was just awful! I am amazed that such drivel is published and sells...and that there must be so many rich whining woman out there that think this is important stuff. The author's description of the main character's life is bad enough; but her solution is even worse. She is going to return to her husband and spend all their accumulated wealth building a (multi-million dollar) home on the ocean. This book is a celebration of selfish, vane, wealthy women."
2,Disappointing,"I made a point of getting this book and do not think I will even finish it. It was recommended by someone on NPR which usually has great recommendations. I am 57 and have gone through some soul searching in my life but I found the main character to be self indulgent and shallow. Having worked since I got out of high school, gone to college, and then law school in my 40s, I thought this character might want something more interesting and productive out of life than the vapid conversations with strangers she meets. I love traveling and meeting new people but these conversations were painful.I enjoyed ""We Are All Welcome Here"" so much that this is doubly disappointing."
1,not possible to give this gobbler no star....,"here it is in a nutshell from the book - life is meaningless and dull! if you can read too far, you will wish you had a meaningless dull life instead of a purgatory being stuck with this annoying harpy Nan. The nicest thing she did was to leave her husband in peace, would that she did so with the dear reader. 5 thumbs down."
3,"This book was good, but it didn't hold me interest","I have read a few of Elizabeth Berg's books.I loved the others that I read, this one didn't seem tohold my attention as best as the others.It was good, and I do recommend it. But not as much as I recommend her others.EMW"
1,Get a life!,"What a whiner! The main character is too self-absorbed, has too much money and too much free time. She's bored with herself, her husband and her life. She certainly bored me!"
2,Equations,The book introduces equations which have variables which are named poorly and lead to confusion.
2,Not so good for graduate exams,"If you are looking for a means to review for a graduate school exam in analytical chemistry, look elsewhere. The material covered in an undergraduate general chemistry textbook is much better for review purposes. For those actually taking the class, I cannot comment on this books' utility."
5,Amazing!!!!,"I have seen the future of rock 'n' roll and its name is Freddy & The Four-Gone Conclusions. Or, maybe I've seen the past. These songs sound like they could have been recorded between 1965-1967. Well-crafted tunes, great music, these guys should be huge. No matter what kind of music you like, you'll love listening to this - it's pure fun."
4,Good overview of TQM ; short on healthcare applications,"This book provides an excellent overview of TQM principles and processes, and practical examples of tools and how to use them. Except for a few references and one detailed case history of TQM applied to solve a problem in a psychiatric hospital, it's short on compelling examples of breakthrough or incremental results achieved in healthcare. Nor does the author really address TQM applied to clinical practices, where ""medical management"" promises important breakthroughs in improved quality and lower costs, but requires the understanding and acceptance of TQM by individual doctors, a famously independent group."
1,No quality control,"The whole track 12 had the tick sound of the metronome, that is very annoying does'nt matter how good the rest of the CD is. And the policy can not return an open CD does not help either."
4,Nice,Very nice video! Tells the story of LTCM. It's not a deep documentary...they don't tell the details of operations LTCM did. They only tell about the mathematic formula that they got to manage the fund.
2,Ruined,"After their debut album and before the masterpiece that would follow rests The Gathering's most obscure and scorned album. These band is still at their early days and current vocalist Anneke had not joined them yet. The music is still in a keyboard doom-metal style, more refined and pretty good. The main and fatal flaw with this album is the vocals. Their original singers left them and out of desperation, madness or whatever.. They recruited a punk singer that would butcher everything by the name of Neils. His faith no more vocals work totaly against the music and as much as I try to listen to the music , I cannot simply due to to horrid singing. There are occasional female vocals by Martine Van Loon that provide some temporary relief.I often think to myself: ""what if Anneke sang on this album ?"" - it would have been a great warmup to the Mandylion album, heck even no vocals would have been good enough.I can only recommend this one to die-hard fans of the bands early period."
5,a well done & important text,"""Women & Christian Origins"" edited by Ross Shepard Kraemer and Mary Rose D'Angelo. This work contains fourteen, academic essays written by professors and scholars, for a higher educational level of study. This is not meant to be a casual, quick read but a college-level text. The subject matter is how women were viewed in writings of their times, and the ability to analyze what that meant, from our current time, with various works at our disposal for study. There is not a blanket acceptance of one source or another, but a critical, open-minded comparison approach. The book when taken as a whole, I truly have only one complaint... the print is small and hard to read. However the subject matter is so important, it was worth this inconvenience."
2,Good Beats - Lacks Meat,"This is a good secular album. I used to love T Bone back in the Redeemed Hoodlum days and it seems that through the span of his career he peaked spiritually (at least lyrically) on The Last Street Preacher. I think he is talented but if you want talent with meat go 116 clique, Tedashii, Lecrae, Flame, PRo, Ambassador, KB, Trip Lee, Andy Mineo, Sho Baraka, Json, This'tl and etc. These dudes bring FIRE and truth, it will minister to you and make you knock ya head the whole time. If you only have 10 bucks, pass on this album and get Lecras Rehab or Tedashii's Blacklight, God Bless! I love ya T Bone but choose gospel or secular, not a watered down mixture."
5,Hot hot hot,This CD is so tight thank God he ain't trying to be all preache' and self righteous and perfect like he got it all together like some Christian rappers do. T bone is trying to reach all people everywhere. He ain't just makin tracks for the christians but for everyone. And his message is still JESUS CHRIST he's just not hitting you over the head with it T bones a bone a fide rapper the best christian rapper and can challenge for best rapper period.
3,A good collection of essays on academia and English language learners,"This book on academic literacy introduces readers to an important concept. As academia becomes more diverse, teachers of writing and literature encounter more students for whom English is a second language. This book is not so much about how to t each or learn English, but how thinking in English is dependent on fluency in English, and thinking in another language can affect academic performance in the language of the academy. It is an interesting collection of essays that stand well on their own. I thought the editors could have arranged them in a more useful way."
3,Poetic licence is used extensively,Jim Thompson was a crime craftsman. His books (mainly written in the 1950's) were marked by stunning storylines that may not have been put to paper as well as they could have been but the premise that Thompson was writing about was there.This book is a look at his life from about the age of 5 to 18-19 or so. There is considerable embellishment taken in the stories but they are entertaining. He discusses his heavy drinking in the latter stages of the book and this is something that plays a part in his books and (sadly) his life.This auto-biography is a lot like Thompson's books - it has a great deal of interest in it but just lacks that special quality in the writing style.It is an easy and quick read which I enjoyed even if I knew that the stories were heavily fictionalised.
2,Jim Thompson's autobiography of his youth - not so good...,"'Bad Boy' by Jim Thompson is essentially his autobiography, detailing his life up until about age twenty. He had a horrible, crazy life. The reader is paraded through his dozens of menial jobs, illegal hijinx, and nasty episodes with classmates and his family. While the early part of 'Bad Boy' is indeed interesting when we don't realize the narrator is Jim Thompson himself. However soon the author gets a bit self-indulgent in describing his wasted youth. I found myself more annoyed with young Thompson than feeling any pity.Bottom life: Jim Thompson had an absolutely rotten childhood. Do you really want to know the details??"
1,WHY are there no answers to MC???,What's the point of the MC at the end of every chapter if a) you cannot find the correct answer and b) your prof doesn't give them to you?? What's the point? Save the room and make the book thinner and easier to drag around with all the other law books you have to schlep around campus.
4,pretty,"The quality is excellent and the color is nice, but I wish it would have been a little bigger."
5,Excellent Visual Reference,"I reviewed this excellent reference book in the May 2006 issue of Period Homes magazine, and the entire article can be found and read online."
3,Endless Fight Scenes,"Fighting fighting and more fighting with bad acting, dubbing and even worse storyline. Robert Tai's action scenes are good and this film could of been editing together so much better the main problem are the Rudy Ray Moore scenes. Best to watch Ninja The Final Duel instead."
1,Weak effort -- not up to Dolemite standards,"I'm a big fan of Rudy's other movies, but this one isn't even in the same league. Basically they bought a lousy kung fu video and spliced in goofy sound effects and a few scenes of Rudy making faces and commenting on the action. Rudy's barely in the thing, and the tedious fight scenes go on forever. Trust me, Rudy's made much better movies. If you're not familiar with Mr. Moore's work, check out Dolemite, Human Tornado or Petey Wheatstraw instead, you'll be glad you did."
3,Pay as little as you can and watch it in installments,"Amazon doesn't provide a way to simultaneously give this 1 star and 5 stars...I'm not familiar with rudy ray moore but disagree that this movie is not funny-c**p. I've seen c**p-c**p and funny-c**p movies and this one is funny. Some of the kung fu is actually cool, the plot is incomprehensible, the photography appalling, the ninja ho' hilarious, the dubbing just rubbish... but if like me you're a masochist stuck 4000 miles from home with just a DvD player and a month's unlimited rental from your nearby blockbuster, then this is definitely recommended. But try not to pay for it or you'll be disapointed..."
1,Avoid like your life depended on it,"I don't actually own this film (Thank GOD!!) I did rent it however, and it stinks! Rudy Ray Moore is past his Dolemite prime in this one. The action part of it is slow and there is no recapturing the glory days. My suggestion is to stick to the orginal and not this cheap imitation to reap money from the Dolemite name."
4,dolemite worst,this is agreat movie put does not live up to the rest of the dolmite classics.its good if you love dolmite bad if your a kung fu fan if you like kung fu movies buy anything Jim Kelly.
2,Cute but it ripped quickly,"This is really cute and fits the player well, but as another reviewer stated the clip is poorly designed. It was so hard to get on and off, the silicon ripped."
5,its just a case of course I'm pleased.,Its great my wife loves the case. she really likes the built-in belt clip. Other than that I mean its a case what else can I say?
1,No Protection,I bought it to protect my player and learned the hard way. I now have a nice scratch on the front...I went back to the case it came with and no clip...stinks!! They should put a clear screen on it...why not?
4,my opinion on pink silicone case,I found the pink sandisk sansa silicone case fit great with the sansa player. It fit better than the original plastic case it came with. It change the look and little bit. My niece didn't even notice it was my old one when I gave it to her so I could changed to the sandisk c100.
4,sandisk sansa silicone case,Easy to fit on the player and offers some protection but not a great deal. The great thing is that in has a belt clip built on to it and this comes in very handy.
3,ehh could be better,i like how it feels but i dont like how it doesnt like cover the screen but it looks good and really compatible with the mp3 so you wont have any trouble with it but i just dont like how it doesnt cover the screen.
3,Not useful to prevent scratches,"I bought this for my SanDisk MP3 player, but ended up going back to the vinyl case that came with the unit. This case does not prevent against scratches to the face -- there is nothing protecting the face at all. It may protect against shocks and the clip is certainly better than the armband that came with the unit. But since I keep the unit in my pocket, I'm more concerned about scratching it."
2,Appearance only - minimal benefits,"The only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection. It is nice that it has a clip, and it fits the mp3 player snugly, but... Would be nice if it has a clear ""window"" to protect the screen."
1,Dead,My player was 32 Days old and it Died. It will not Start. When I turn it on it just sits at the initilize screen and will not go any further.
3,Part of the way in understanding Tantra,Daniel Odier's Desire: The Tantric Path to Awakening is a good introduction to Tantra but I did not lose the feeling that Tantra was just an excuse for licentiousness until I read his subsequent book Yoga Spandakarika. In the latter Odier relays a fuller understanding of and feeling for Tantra. I would read them together as a set.
5,"It's cheesecloth! If it's too loose, fold it in half!","Everyone knows that to make cheesecloth more fine, you fold it in half. Here we have two sq. yards of regular Regency cheesecloth. Folded in half, you get one square yard twice as fine. Or you could pay a little more and get one square yard of Regency ""Extra Fine"" cheesecloth, which does pretty much the same thing. Me, I get this one."
2,Too Narrow,I was disappointed in this product. I expected this to be 2 yds of fabric. It was 2 yds of a strip about 8 inches wide. Just a warning to purchasers that you may probably be better served by going to a fabric store and buying what you need.
3,Needs to be more tightly woven,This cheesecloth does come in handy and is strong enough to hold the weight of whatever you are straining. My problem was that the mesh was not any more fine than a sieve. I usually run chicken broth through a sieve to filter it and then through cheesecloth to really get all the fine particles. This cheesecloth did not do a very good job of catching those particles. I also thought it was a little pricey for the amount you get. I will probably try a different brand next time.
2,Not really happy,"This is a VERY loosely woven cheesecloth, and it's also a long, thin strip. Yes, it's a double layer, but the open weave makes it near impossible to open up and rearrange.I'll be giving it to mu husband to use with his Halloween decorations, and then searching for something better."
5,Good price for good quality cheese cloth,There is not much to really say about cheese cloth. If you are buying it then you probably know what it looks like and how it should act. This is perfectly average quality cheese clothe (meaning it is no better or worse than any other cheese cloth). The price for this cheese cloth is good and cheese clothe is a very versatile product that can be used in the kitchen or in a variety of other circumstances where you would need to filter liquids or clean delicate surfaces.
5,Worked much better than expected,"I was a little unsure where I was going to mount this switch to have easy nighttime access to it for dimming... To my surprise, when hooked up it enabled me to dim the gauges to a suitable max setting, and then when I used my stock lighting dimmer control it seemed to have MUCH greater sensitivity and ability to dim the gauges.... The best part is because it improved the ability for the stock dimmer to work, it won't have to be mounted in a place where I'll need constant access, I just secured it up under the dash with the rest of the wiring. Fast shipping as always with amazon!!!!"
4,"It keeps going, and going, and going....","Part of the reason Dickens uses his ""flowery"" language, despite the effectiveness in creating vivid imagery, was that he was paid by the word. Therefore, his wordiness should not solely be considered an artistic choice, which makes you a bit more sympathetic to how long winded this book can seem. It is however a classic for good reason, with a compelling plot, even without very memorable characters. Still a good book to read for its historical context, and if you can handle the language it, for its good story."
5,Great Live Concert,Rammstein is the greastest German band. Extremely interesting lyrics and poserful music. The stage show is unlike anyone else.
1,Is music pricelss?,I believe whomever is incharge of pricing the band's music needs to rethink who they are selling to. My kids - as well as myself love Rammstein but I will not pay this amount for four cds to any band.I thought the newsletter said it would be $102. I could somehow work with that but this amount of 171.99 is too much.
5,Head Banging,If you are a Rammstein fan or if your're not. This will have your head bobbing and your feet tapping. I have just recently listened to the sounds of Rammstein and I purchased this for a friend. Now I wish that I had ordered 2 of these. You have the concert to enjoy as well as the CD to listen to in the car. This collection is awsome.
2,tired,"This CD feels tired. If you were down with the first attempt, you'll understand. The cameos on this CD feel gratuitous. On ""So How's you're girl??"" having Miho rap Dr. Octogon lyrics on ""Metaphysical"" was genuis. Don't listen to the Johnny Come Lately's on this one. Save your money or buy the first CD. The only good track on this CD is ""Rock and Roll never hip-hopped like this, Pt. 2"" - and that owes its pedigree to the first CD. The combinations are forced. These guys were the first to really explore the rock/hip-hop mash-up. It's too bad that they were content to do the same thing with newer names, and not develop the steez."
2,"Exactly what I didn't expect from HBMS, 2 generous stars","I thought I knew what to expect when I heard there was a new HBMS project coming out. I was pretty excited for a follow-up to ""So How's Your Girl?"", one of the best albums ever released in my opinion.So when I read the list of guests for this project I was pretty disappointed, especially when I saw Cat Power and Linkin Park. But I still kept an open mind, figuring if anyone can pull such a line-up off, it was Automator and Prince Paul.But as I listened to the cd, I found myself skipping tons of the content to try and find something worthy of being on a HBMS release. The cd has a very boring feel to it. If you were into ""So How's Your Girl?"" and expect this to be anything like it, don't.I can definitely say this isn't for hip hop heads, or even for myself, whose musical backround spans from rock/classic rock to underground hip hop. A very disappointing release. Download it before you buy it, then buy it if you like it."
4,Grown-up Hip-Hop,"I'm really into the concept behind the Handsome Boy Modeling School...being a gorgeous male model myself...anyway, this album gets 5 stars for creativity and breadth of sound, but for musical content, it gets 4. The high point of the album is Dre's track ""First...and then..."" He absolutely rocks it! Paul & Automater's production behind him is nothing short of excellent. That track is so good, it almost gets the album to 5 stars. The first HBMS album had a similar feel, a wide array of musical styles, I highly suggest owning both.As far back as this album reaches to hip-hop's roots, (thus the title, grown-up hip-hop) it reaches way out in front as well towards what we may come to see in the future. Amazon.com is also offering the instrumental version of this album...(my local recond store did not.) I'll be ordering it in a couple days."
3,"Fun, but not as great as So How's Your Girl","This has some fun songs and beats, and the same silly humor, but it's not quite as rad as the first album. Still, its enjoyable and I can't hate on it for not having samples of Chris Elliot being insane in this album ;)"
4,Still So Handsome,"What a relief. Prince Paul the amazing Dan the Automator have done it again. They managed to crank out an excellent sophomore album that lives up to the high expectations set by their debut work ""So...How's your Girl?"" This album offers a much larger variety in musical styles then the first album. In addition, the laundry list of guest stars is amazing. They've got all the genre bases covered, with artists like Del tha Funky Homosapien, Jack Johnson, Mike Patton, Mike Shinoda, and the hilarious Tim Meadows doing a rendition his ""Lady's Man"" role from SNL. If you're a fan of Automator or are looking for some genre-bending music, you can't go wring with the new Handsome boy Modeling School album. It's music, it's a curriculum, it's a lifestyle, it's awesome."
5,Timely Review,"""Blahous has produced a timely, comprehensive, accessible . . . review of the issues involved in financing Social Security after 2020. . . . Blahous is aware that the complexity of Social Security means there is no single best financial and political solution. Interested readers will find this a sound addition to the literature. Useful index. All collections."" CHOICE"
5,Great book! Most important tool in a construction project.,A great tool for incorporating Christain principles in the wordly business of construction. Offers great suggestions on protection of pastor - congregation relationship during a construction project to ensure unity in the building process from conception to completion.
5,All churches should read this book before they build,I'm so glad I found this book. It makes managing a church building project much easier. I especially like the parts about Soul Searching - which is the author's term for figuring out what to build. Buying this book is money well spent.
3,Good Book At High Price,"The book has excellent information written in an easy to read manner. The ""SOUL SEARCHING"" section is well written. I thought that the ""Training Session for the Building Committee"" was too generalized. I was expecting more ""how to"" information in this section. Additionally, I felt the book price was high."
5,An excellent resource for people who want to understand their addicts.,I read this book the first time about 25 years ago to help me understand what was going on with my alcoholic husband. It made a lot of sense to me and truly changed my way of thinking. I have given copies to family members or friends dealing with similar situations over the years.
1,Save your money,"I purchased this desk and it definitely was not what I expected. It is extremely difficult to assemble and actually had 4 twist lock pieces missing. The ""patented twist lock"" assembly is a joke. The pieces do not attach tightly and my husband actually had to reinforce several pieces. The ""leather"" top is NOT leather, it is laminate (doesn't even look like leather). The majority of the desk is NOT WOOD, it is particle board!!. The legs are wood and the desk looks OK; however, it is NOT as advertised. The desk is made by Sauder, the same company that makes alot of the cheaper laminate furniture. I am very disappointed! If it wouldn't cost a fortune in shipping, I would return this item and spend my money elsewhere. Buyer Beware!!!"
5,"MY SECRET ""EYEDENTITY""!!!","I discovered this group on James Hardway's recent ""Over Easy"" CD. I was instantly floored by the floetic rhymes and vocals of Diana and Krishna Booker. On Eyedentity's debut, ""See"", there's much of the same with droves of hypnotic vocals and Twista-like rapping, embellished with haunting dub-wise grooves and orchestrations. The lyrics are fresh and original, and the mood laid back and at times melanchonic--but in a good way. Eyedentity's style can be likened to Portishead, DJ Cam (Mad Blunted Jazz) and even a little bit of Jill Scott, only with their own unique blend of ""ethno"", spoken-word, trip-hop and acid funk. Eyedentity will probably go unnoticed by the masses, but if you're tired of what's out there now being overplayed, you'll find ""See"" to be a breath of fresh air."
3,Great game that doesn't last long,"The dice game ""Greed"" is fast-paced, fun and good for all ages. Even kids can catch on quickly. The only problem is the letters begin rubbing off the dice after a short time and then the dice need to be replaced. I guess they are ok for occasional use, but our group used them a lot until they became too much trouble to see and maintain."
5,Game,I already had this game really wanted the cloth game board more then anything but this did not come with one. I was disappointed about that. Fun game just need the cloth game board that goes with this!
2,It could be a good game but..,"I received Greed as a Christmas present and it looks like it may be a fun game, but the directions are not clear. A group of 5 of us tried to play, but none of us could comprehrend the rules. They do provide a table of points, but it is unclear how to assess points or what happens if you keep rolling. Also, I could not find a web site where questions could be answered or rules clarified. Yes, it probably could be a fun and educational game, but because of the lack of clarity on how to play and score it, I can not recommend it at this time."
5,Amazing and Intriguing,A must watch if you like mysteries that trend toward the intellectual and ephemeral. Don't assume you've figured it out...particularly the ending. It's too easy to make an assumption that minimizes the entire potential arch of the story.
2,too tight for my head; causes pain,I have an average sized head. I cannot wear this visor for more than nine holes of golf.
2,Not so yummy,"These have a good regular muffin texture, but a really strong artificial sweetener taste. I will eat them since I made them, but I will never buy it again."
5,Perfection!,"While it's true this product contains a lot of coconut (and I'm not a huge fan of coconut) I think these muffins are as good, if not better, than regular carrot cake. Even my family loves them and they aren't on low carb diets. These are a staple in my kitchen!"
5,my friend with autism,"I got this book for my sons teacher to read to his class.It made it easier for the kids to ask questions(like the ""odd"" behaviors,and why he does not talk..etc)The kids also liked coloring the pages.I also recomend ""Andy and his yellow frisbee""(in that book Andy is non verbal and makes nosies and has ""stimming"" behaviors"
4,"One, Fun Adventure!",The Adventure's of Cinderella's Daughter is a joy for people of all ages. As a fan of the story of Cinderella - it was a delight to see an intrepretation into the next step in the tale. With a talented cast - including Shirley Jones and Jim Wise and a surprise cameo by Stan Lee - of Spiderman fame - this family film delivers 90 minutes of pure funfilled enjoyment. Definitley check it out!
3,Cinderella for the younger set,"Ok I bought this DVD because I love Joe Lando and Shirley Jones. Lando is charming as the besotted King Gregory, Cinderella's husband, and Shirley Jones is beguiling as the fairy godmother. If you can get through the first 20 minutes, you can get through to the end. The younger actors are stereotype cardboard characters, the script leaves a lot to be desired and the music is just horrible. And there is really no need for a bumbling fairy godbrother or an evil wedding warlock (don't ask.) Young girls and tweens will probably love to add this TV movie to their collection, but older girls should stick with Ever After (Drew Barrymore.) Watch for a cameo of Stan Lee as the priest who marries Cinderella and shouts his trademark ""excelsior""!"
1,Terrible movie,I got this movie because it sounded cute and had Joe Lando and Shirley Jones in it. What a major disappointment. It was like watching a taped version of a Jr. High play. Nothing against the actors; they did the best they could with what they were given. Didn't even hold my 9 year old niece's attention. I was very sorry that I made this purchase.
3,NO Closed Captioning,what we were able to watch of the movie without the closed captioning that Amazon and the back of the DVD case stated it had was okay but we didn't get to watch much due to this fact.
2,Wish it was done better.,"It was a very good story but it was done as though it was done live on stage. They had very good actors. I was very unhappy with the way the ""movie"" was done."
2,stiff,it looks cool but it very stiff. maybe i should have realized thats what a straw hat would be like.
4,Sad = Scary?,"Perhaps I'm a little odd by thinking that the most spinetingling ones are the two saddest - One Chance and The Thing in Auntie Alma's Pond. Both are beautifully written and mournful beyond doubt. The others, well... Not so sure. Most are wierd and hard to understand."
4,The next step after beginning bridge,"Not as good as his beginners' book, but this is still worthwhile. Seems like Lampert needed to write an intermediate book between this one and the beginners' guide. Enough gems in it to make it a good purchase."
2,Insufficient info on sweeteners,"It is unclear if this contains maltodextrin. I ordered it (sold by Trend Marketing and fulfilled by Amazon), and received the maltodextrin containing brand which I did not want. I ultimately went with the Now Foods brand pure organic psyllium husk powder - it is free of unnecessary sweeteners."
2,Better products are available,I did not order this from Amazon but purchased it while out of the country. I wanted something to add fiber to my diet and help to keep me regular. I found that Metamucil made me very gassy and uncomfortable and this continued for a number of weeks. I have since tried Benefiber which seems much better to me and my doctor suggested that I also try Citrucel. His experience has been that Citracel does not make you gassy but I have not tried it yet. Another solution to irregularity is eating prunes and this for me may be the best solution.
2,A bit disappointing,"I was expecting a different book when I bought this. It is not so much about meeting the masters, but more a factual book about the life of many of the masters described by Blavatsky. The masters themselves do not speak in this book. An in-depth analysis is made about Blavatsky, and the reader is left to decide for himself what to believe.If you are looking for a critical book about Blavatsky and her supposed masters, you will not be disappointed, although I found the book to be bone-dry to read at times.If, on the other hand, you want to get to know the masters better, there are much better books available, such as ""Lords of the seven rays"" by Mark L. Prophet, from The Summit Lighthouse, a later dispensation of the Ascended Host."
4,digitally-created 90's electronic music,"As the artist's project name ""digital ART"" suggests, there's none of your retro malarkey here, this is digitally-created 90's electronic music, heavily related on melody and structure. [...] So if you're fed up with the latest retro outing then give this a go. It's worth well just over an hour of your time."
3,Too slow-moving to be satisfying,"As a descendant of the Jewish community of Aleppo, which is rich in tradition, Sabato has many stories to tell. However, this book is simply too slow-moving and discursive to be fully satisfying. As a literary detective story, the first tale is promising but just isn't told in a way that is exciting or dramatic. This book would have been better had Sabato concentrated on keeping his plot moving, or had he written it as a nonfiction memoir of growing up in this unique Jewish civilization.Perhaps the problem is that the magic of a writer like S.J. Agnon, to whom Sabato is often compared, is just not easily duplicated."
3,A Christian View of World Religions,"This book was informative & a nice overview of the major religions and popular spiritual practices. I only give it three stars because in the beginning, the author's admit they are Christian, but claim that this will still be an unbiased look at world religion. I do not believe they back this claim, as I found much of the book CHristian oriented. (there is nothing wrong with that if that is what you are looking for) If you are a CHristian and want to better understand the faiths around, this is the book for you! However, if you are looking for a general look at faiths, you may want to dig further. I must admit that there is an amazing amount of information in such a small book."
2,Bias or uninformed,"Picked up this book because I wanted to be a bit more religiously aware. At the time, I did not realize it's bias angle. The book promotes such things as Buddhism is nihilistic and that followers believe nothing exist -- straight from mis-informed 101. It promotes the idea that Mormons are a ""cult"" -- never mind its a world religion with some 13 million followers. The argument made is that its a cult because it is a break-away from mainstream Christianity. So is Christianity a cult because it splintered from Judaism? In any case, there a much better informing books out there if you want an overview of religions w/o bias."
3,Is it a tad bit biased? You decide,"This is one of the first religious books I read. I can't say it was too great. It was probably on the same level as books like The Idiot's Guide to... or ___ for Dummies. It is published by a publishing house which is known for its anti-Catholicism. However, I cannot recall any material which the Roman Catholic would be offended. If anything, it gave me an introduction to other world religions, and even the fringe Christian religions. In the end the authors make a case for Christ, obviously, but of course, it makes the case for the Protestant doctrines as well. That is, the relationship with God that has as its guideline, the Protestant system, is a bit different from the Catholic system. So, it is perhaps not a good idea for a recent convert to Catholicism or a young cradle Catholic.-Laurence"
3,"Good book, a bit dry in parts...","3/4s of this book is SOLID GOLD! LDS, JW, and The New Age Movement r covered BEAUTIFULLY here. But the other parts are dry and didn't hold me."
1,Kill the Shogun,"I like to watch oriental movies but this one is a piece of junk. The argument and dialogues were poor as well the pictures and scenes. I wasted my time by watching and buying this product. I highly recommend DO NOT BUY this film. If I can, I will rate zero to the left!!!Kill the Shogun"
4,The Funk has returned,"This Funk is Done better than I have heard in many years. All of the songs are bumping but I'm loving song number 3. It has all of the elements that are heard on the radio today yet reminding me of what funk does better than any other type of music. Makes you use your imagination. The Red Light District is both creative and funky. Taking me to another place and time. Glory B! That Funks on me! Funky grooves and funky vocals. Thank you for rescuing me from the blahs. Nice work. Live Horns and more live guitar riffs, live drums will have me hitting that 5 star slot on your next venture. Thank you Queen Bride Silva. You have dared to bring back the funk, the whole funk, nothing but the funk."
5,Only for those who understand real funky music,"and that is me. almost 13 but there is no place to click for 13, I have been Listening to songs that my dad plays such as Prince, EWF, Rick James, Parliament, Graham Central Station, New Edition, Isley Brothers, Stevie Wonder, La Belle, all my life, so I feel her music. What is different from the real old songs is that her cd sounds new. This CD could fit perfectly into the music on the radio, while staying close to the sounds on the hits records that came out a long time ago. My dad said the beats are all new school, the music is something you don't hear anymore,,something about a real productions. My best song on Dawn Silvas cd is song number one, as long as its on the one. I'm playing this song every day after school, and I am not tired of it ever."
4,pure funk,"Dawn Silva takes the funk and works the heck out of it on ""All My Funky Friends."" She has an absolutely beautiful and hypnotic voice that is a definitive example of female funk singing. The songs are tight and Dawn sails under, over and around them...a funk priestess casting a spell. Tracks of special note: ""As Long As It's On The One: ""Red Light District"", and ""Close To You"" and a sexy funk slow jam. Dawn And the players on the CD also perform a monster remake of ""I'D Rather Be With You., the Bootsy classic. ""Calling out your name"", is another special track. This is a good Album."
4,DA BOMB,"This CD is DA BOMB. Its very funky! I don't see why it isn't getting played on the radio. I'm a club DJ and I've already selected 2 songs that get positive responses: ""I'd Rather Be With You"" and Do You Remember Them."" Its old school in how funky it is but it's new school in the production. It should be getting played right along with Janet Jackson or Faith Evans.Dawn has a very original and sensual voice and people need to recognize. This CD is very pumpin and needs to be heard"
4,Feeling the Groove,it took me a while to get around but once I got my hands on this set Mini Afro was Bopping.Dawn Silvia is tight.in this day&age where Funk is Missing Badly in Action it's so Cool to Have A Sister Bringing it ON!the Vocals are tight&The Grooves Have a Strong P-Funk&Sly Stone Vibe.back in the day this would be played all over the Radio Stations but nowadays Talent like this is Underground where Lames are Given all the glory.Don't Sleep on this Funk.it's Worth seeking out.
5,This has to be the best funk in a decade.,"I was hoping someone from the Parliament or Bootsy camp would come up with some new funk, but I never expected it to come from one of The Brides Of Funkenstein. You have answered all my funk dreams, above and beyond the call of funk duty. This is your funk soldier badge number 212 reporting for duty MADAM FUNK! Just tell me where the concert is. Don't even ask! Just buy this CD. There is a song for everyone on this disk! I just so happen to like them all. Especially Disco To GO. Oh yeah this is funky. I play it all day, everyday. All My Funky Friends want copies, but I say nope! Hit that amazon.com or hit Miss Silva direct and may all your funk dreams hit you wit the one and then. Thanks Silva, this is the bomb."
5,Love this CD,"I was surprised when I heard the quality of this independent release. Most cds released through the artist are missing the quality of crisp clear productions. Not on this disk. The production is clean and each song is filled with strong funk grooves. My favorite, the opening song, ""On The One"" is played over and over. I love the concept of this song and the lyrical content. Stacks of (Funk) chants, layers of sweet voices by Dawn Silva and funky friends. Her musical interludes include a flavor of R&B, hip-hop and funk, which has not been heard like this in many years. In fact don't think any funk productions, old or new, have had the musical, or vocal collaboration's of this CD. Hats, gloves and shoes off to a most impressive CD."
5,AS GOOD AS IT GETS,I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT I MISSED THIS ONE. THIS IS TRULY THE FUNKIEST ALBUM I HAVE HEARD SINCE FREAKBASS!!! THE FUNK IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING THROUGH DAWN SILVA.EVERYONE I HAVE TURNED ON TO THIS CD LOVES IT AS MUCH AS I DO!
3,Couldn't be better...,"This was just what I was looking for. I was perfect to update my handwriting skills, and has made my handwriting more legible than ever."
1,The Hobbit: Prima's Official Strategy Guide,"I purchased this book, thinking that it would be a guide for The Hobbit for Game Boy Advantage, and it does not cover this video game......The information given for this book does not specify the video games that it does cover."
3,NOT FOR GAME BOY!,I also purchased this book thinking it would work for the GameBoy since it was stated for the GameCube but the games are only simular in abstract ways and does not help for the gameboy/gameboy advanced games.Also from the the looks of the book if you have any choice for game help between Prima and Nitendo Power help books - go with the Nitendo Power I think you will be happier with that book's layouts.Anyone have any sources for Gameboy help for this game please note it.
1,Disappointed,"They had a great lineup of teachers here, but both segments of this DVD deal with rods, lines, casting, etc. I learned NOTHING about how to bonefish from this DVD. It was a waste of money. If you want instruction on fly casting, it could be helpful, but there are plenty of other videos out there."
3,"Could be more focused on specifics, fewer fishing scenes","I'm an intermediate level caster with limited experience in flats fishing and thought this DVD might be a good learning tool.I picked up a few tips but found the information to be a bit unorganized and thought the fishing scenes took up space where actual instruction could have been substituted. I would not use this as a single source to prepare for a trip but might be a good addition to other books, DVD's etc."
1,Linda Munk is a bitter old lady,"We all know, of course, that Munk bought her way into academe with her husband's fortune. Her pretentious, bloated book is a clear indication that wealth can open the well-greased doors of the ivory tower.Avoid this title at all costs! Munk has left a legacy of bad teaching at the U of Toronto, and this book is, sadly, as bad a piece of scholarship as she was a professor."
3,Good Library Addition,"This DVD, ""The Bloody Aleutians"" is a good addition to my library of the history of World War 2. Great mixture of Color and B/W footage. It will greatly assist decendents of soldiers and sailors, who were stationed in the Aleutians, with understanding the surroundings under which our fathers served our country during the War."
5,Excellent safety Glasses,"I have been using disposable safety glasses for years. The do the job but are not very comfortable and even though I reuse the glasses, they get expensive since they must be replaced frequently.In contrast, the Dewalt DPG55-C1 glasses are exceptionally comfortable, provide excellent clarity and coverage, have been immune to machine oils and have taken a lot of abuse. In reality, I expect that the glasses will be classified as a ""consumable"". They should last for a decent period of time but not years (in my abusive environment). In circumstances where more care is taken, they should last a very long time. In any event they are inexpensive so I can afford to have several for standbys."
5,Only gets better !!!!,"Book two of ""The Christ Clone"" trilogy is better than the first. The beginning of the end has started and no one knows who to turn to for salvation. Who will stop the tribulations. Who will lead humanity through the horrors sent to them? Is Christopher Goodman the person to do it...or not?This book contans some of the best written scenes of destruction ever put to paper. As the final plagues hit the Earth James Beauseignuer paints a realistic picture of the gruesome events man faces. These sequences are so vivid they rival anything in the best written horror novels (there is a scence invovling an asteroid that has some of the most gripping writing I've ever read!) The suffering the people go through is palpable. A great setup for the conclusion."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"The book was pretty short. There is a ton of stuff that could be included within the story lines he's developed, and he left them cold. It was interesting to see what his take on Revelation is, but there's just too much promise for the limited payoff.I still think it is kinda unusual how he's used barely hidden names of real people and groups as his antagonists/protagonists, along with their real information."
1,Christians - don't waste your time!!,"I do like a little controversy but this is so ""left field"" that I could not finish the 2nd book in this trilogy. I found it so close to blaspheme that I had to stop. I would not recommend this trilogy to anyone, especially Christian friends."
1,Really not even worth rating,"I didn't finish this book - I stopped my misery! I really only read the first few pages and bits and peaces as I skimed through the pages. It's just as poorly written as the first (In His Image - see my review there) and just as BORING. The only reason I even started this book was that I spent my $6.99 on it - thank goodness I didn't buy the third book in the triology. Mr. Beauseigneur has a LOT to learn with regard to writing - perhaps he should take a couple of courses on creative writing! He could do with some instruction on how to develop his characters. Well, no matter - I know the story (the REAL one) and know how it ends!"
4,exciting second instalment of the Christ Clone trilogy,"James Beauseigneur is a fine writer, and here he continues his highly entertaining Christ Clone trilogy with a book that does not develop plot and character to the extent of the first book (But oh! the plot that IS there is mindblowing!), but concentrates instead on apocalyptic comets and plagues and locusts (oh my!). The author's descriptions are horrifying and riveting, and developments have led to a situation both complex and thrilling. Will Christopher Goodman, the man cloned from cells harvested from the Shroud of Turin, be elected Secretary General of the UN? Is he a returning messiah, or could he be the Anti-Christ? You HAVE to read the first book of the trilogy, In His Image, before tackling this one.This seems to be an intelligent, educated and creative series, and I'm really looking forward to reading the last book to see how it all turns out."
3,Not what I expected,This book has several situations which I did not expect. I am not to sure I understand the ending. I did not expect Christ to be the antiChrist. Very snappy and very logical how the author develops his story. There is a lot of Biblical fact used to support his story as it develops. I could not put it down once I started. I am going on to the third book and hope it is not a let down.
3,"Book was good, but price was outrageous for an ebook","This book was fairly well written.Only purchased it because it wasn't at the Library yet.$9.99 for an ebook seems really high to me, especially when 40% of the book is footnotes."
5,TCCT is THE BEST!!,"I stopped reading the Left Behind series after #4 (Soul Harvest). I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. I also read (actually started reading) We All Fall Down, but there the foul language was SO EXCESSIVE I couldn't keep going. Finally I read the books of The Christ Clone Trilogy (why do I feel like Goldilocks here?) and they were ""just right!"" Actually they're GREAT! So if you're tired of Buck and Rayford playing James Bond, and all the females in the Left Behind world cooing, get The Christ Clone Trilogy."
4,The series is good but.......,The second book in the Christ Clone Trilogy involves the coming to power of the anti-Christ and the disaters on earth that coincide with his coming. I question wether the information in the second insatllment could not have been included at either the end of book one or at the begining of book three thus saving the reader a few bucks. I find myself having trouble identifying and caring for the characters in this series as I did with the people in the Left Behind series. They seem shallow and hard to like even Decker who this series has centered around. This book was a good read but it never hooked me the way I expected based on other reviews here.
4,Very bright,I am a Union carpenter and often work with Efco forms and in low light/visibility areas. This high vis/orange chalk shows up very well on the dark face of Efco's and when snapped on concrete it looks like a laser line.
4,$39.99 for genuine leather,This Friday Deal item is perfect. I need a small seat for dumbbell lifting and the material is genuine leather and black matching my computer chair. The wood legs match my computer table that coincidentally cost $39.All the necessary pieces for putting the legs on were present and assembly was easy. The only problem is that one of the pieces of wood as legs has a deep long split on an inner side. This was split already when it was attached because it has been stained and did not occur in transit.The legs are level after assembly. I am very happy and grateful that this item was priced affordably.Made in China
4,An exciting adventure in space!!,"If you like books about space, then this is the book for you. ""Omega Station"" takes place in the deep space. This awesome book is written by Alfred Slote. The story takes place on a planet called C.O.L.A.R. The main characters are Danny, Dr.Drago, an Dr.Ak. Danny tries to find out why Dr.Drago has been stealing robots. I would recommend this book to my friends and family because it is full of adventure. I give the book 4 stars!!!!Book review by: Garrett Ruiz"
4,truth from an outsider,"This is a short read, but highly insightfull and thought-provoking. His opinions rang true with me. It's amazing how relevant, even prophetic, this 33-year-old speech is for the United States today. Mr. Solzhenitsyn did not mince words but told it like he saw it.I purchased a used copy (originally from the Green Mountain School Library in Chester, Vermont) in which the glue (holding the cover to the rest of the small book) has dried and is now littering my desk. The cover is totally detached, but the pocket, still holding the library check-out card to the back cover facing page, is firmly attached! I don't mind; I treasure this little volume."
2,Deceptive Marketing - Buyer Beware,"Matthew Cohen is an excellent teacher of Tai Chi and Qi Gong, and the production quality of both this DVD and his Fire and Water program are very good. That being said, if you already own Fire and Water you already have one of the two workouts on this DVD. The other one is not his best. Bottom line: if you own Fire & Water, skip this one. If you don't have either, buy Fire & Water instead.Dear Acacia: Listen up... Your customers are NOT happy when you re-package old programs with new titles. They feel ripped off, deceived and angry when you do this. Its bad karma to boot."
1,Don't bother,"It's obvious from the author's capsule reviews of Vonnegut's 'Cat's Cradle' and CS Lewis' Ransom trilogy that she hasn't read the books. And those are just 2 books I know well and happened to read her articles on first - I gave up after that, deciding that there was no way of believing anything else she said without reading the original sources. Which makes buying the encyclopedia pointless...."
4,Quality performances but constantly mellow,"Although Bill Charlap and Sandy Stewart are consummate performers, I must agree with the review of Sharlan Douglas. Both mother and son compliment their artistry so skillfully but the tempo of each selection is ultimately and regretfully the same throughtout the entire album. Neither the superbly intimate phrasing of Sandy Stewart nor the tenderly responsive accompaniment of Bill Charlap sustained the interest of this listener. However, when my choice is limited to a few numbers, the combined talents of both vocalist and pianist are intoxicating as one's stimulating indulgence of a fine and delicate wine."
5,absolutely lovely,Wonderful interpretations of all the songs and easy listening - rare in todays screaming presentations. Mother and son also very special
1,"If it is free, WHY DOES IT COST???","Looks like a classic Amazon rip-off, AGAIN! FREE, BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY??? WTF!!! IF YOU PAY FOR THIS FREE PATCH THEN YOU SUPPORT DOMESTIC CORPORATE TERRORISM!!!"
4,a must have for any aquarists,"I have several of these in both small and large sizes. The large sizes are strongly recommended. In fact, get at least TWO - one to put water and fish, and the other to store the net and other tools dry.The smaller size is barely big enough for any average net so it's difficult to handle the fish. However, this large container is perfect for just about any net and also can hang on tanks of all sizes from 10 gallon to 150 gallon tank rims.The only drawback is that the plastic turns from clear when new to frosted/scratched looking plastic in a hurry. Not a problem normally, but a problem for people trying to take pictures or look closely at the specimen for details.Regardless, this is an essential item to anyone with fish or small pets.Strongly recommended."
2,Not that hot,"This guide is far too light on configuration, routing and detailed information about clients"
2,Disappointed....,"The quality was good, but the stone or the size was not accurate. I was not happy with how small it really was, and the color was like a leopard print. Would not have bought it if I had seen it first."
3,picture not accurate,nice little pendant but the picture of the stone is not accurate - mine looks more like a leopard pattern. Setting is nice so will keep.
5,"Almost Speechless leaves you just that, almost speechless","The first time I listened to this CD, I was blown away. The band's sound is amazing and the songs' lyrics grab you and pull you right in. If you're looking for the next ""Big Thing"", then look no further than Almost Speechless! These guys are great!"
5,this brings a new twist on evil twin plot,"Madness gave birth to twins...one of them not quite there. A family isolated from town and from this world. One twin try to bring the other in this world, and reading of the Necromicon.A world where whipperwills are a cacophany of sounds, where vegetations are decaying and a mountain that has a monument older than the inhabitations of the local Native Americans.This is one of Lovecraft's best works. Tom Bougha"
1,Ham-it-up Horror,"hmmmmmmm interesting, totally overacted. although it does cheer me up at times. Although I have to admit, if I want to get rid of people at the end of an evening, then this is the tape that will do it! Listening to this version is sure to set any shivers down your spine, than any un-namable, amorphous, writhing mass of tentacles (choose your preference) that any of Lovecraft's creations possess. If you're a lover of Lovecraft's work, then I would advise getting hold of the version read by Robert M. Price, which is produced by Necronomicon Press"
1,Poor Version of a Horror Classic,"Where is it written that all dramatizations of Lovecraft have to be done by overacting, community theater rejects? I tried listening to this ridiculous excuse for a radio drama, and I had high hopes. Instead, I heard over-acting that made me cringe! The adaptation was scatter-brained and thin. It was far too short to properly handle this story, which is one of the greatest Lovecraft stories. If you love Lovecraft, as I do, STAY AWAY FROM THIS VERSION! I have gotten rid of my copy of this horrible tape, but I still can't get the bad taste out of my mouth."
1,Another either/or book,"Barone, no matter how rational and intellectualized has againmade a right or left, good or bad and therefore extremely oversimplified the real discussion and history at hand. Neocons will use it as a saintly reference affirming their cherished opinions. The rest of us left, right, up, down will remain skeptical. Not worth the money-you can get it on any website."
2,"Some valuable thoughts, but little depth!","Barone does have some valuable analysis in areas such as welfare reform and the military. However, most other areas of discussion are unoriginal, superficial, and at times devoid of support. The statistical support for his information on welfare reform (ex. Tommy Thompson-WI) and the success of advancement in the military for non-whites has merit. His exploration into the ills of our educational system becomes a crusade as the evidence for his claims is nonexistent. He would have done better to eliminate it from the book because it is much more complex than what he portrays. He mentions that the failure of our schools can only be changed by parents; but those parents spend less time with their kids, are more concerned with grades than acquistion of knowledge, and at times omit the Hard symbol of accountability. Overall a decent book, but unoriginal in thought and lacking significant depth."
2,Once again,"Like the other solo records, I tried and tried to get through it with something that really grabbed me. Not so much."
2,Most 'poppy'/boring to me of his solo works,"I love all of Lanegan's solo albums except for this one. Most everyone gives it such rave reviews, I had to put in my two cents. I really dug the first one so when the second one came out, I was really psyched. It was really disappointing for me. Where his first was a departure for him from what the Screaming Trees were doing (which I really dug too), this second one just seemed trite, like he and whoever he was working with was able to make it sound like Poco or a depressed and depressing Neil Diamond. I guess it depends on what you're into, but I personally prefer any of his other records over this one."
2,Why in heck did he leave the Trees???!!!!???!!!!!,"Why in heck did this jerk leave the Trees? That was the most happenin' band in Seattle, we all loved 'em. ""Nearly Lost You"" was the best song of the '90s, by far! Now Lanegan leaves Queens of the Stone Age and what are we left with - nothin'!!!The Trees were a top Seattle band that kills the morbid junk on this dusky album. Again, I don't see why Mark Lanagen left the Trees to join Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, then later Q.O.T.S.A. Those bands had something to offer, but Lanegan as a solo artist is Dullsville, U.S.A., as you can tell by my low star rating. In fact, I only gave it 2 stars because one of the songs on this CD sort of reminds me of the Trees.For reviews on all top albums of the day, keep checking in on my site.THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!!!!!!!!"
1,horrible,"Another misfire by Hess, who only know to take the combt reports from the Fighter Grouops war diaries and then publish them. There[s no insight, no human side to the history. Sad."
1,Weak..,"Hess writes in a gruesome manner, totally ""cold"", only copying the combat records from the fighter Squadrons. He gives us no inner feeling the pilots had, no funny comments or details, nothing!"
5,Cute!,"My little guy got this for Christmas last year and he has had a blast with them. He useually doesn't use the wagon to pull the blocks around, He like to put his cars or action figures in it. And There are endless possibilities with the blocks. Though with this particular set, it doesn't come with very many blocks so we have purchased more. This is a cute toy!"
1,Haven't even received this toy and ordered over a month ago!!!!,I've always liked Amazon very much but I ordered this toy over a month ago and it still hasn't shipped!
4,Necta Sweet Saccharin,"I was very pleased with the vendor and product. With the introduction of Aspartame (Nutra Sweet) it is very hard to find Saccharin in stores. I have a bad reaction to Aspartame, and don't consider it safe, so I have stayed with Saccharin."
5,good product,Very hard to find. All the stores used to stock it. no one does now. I 've preferred it for fifty years. much better than all the others.
3,Woman on Top -DVD,"Sunny,breezy,sexy flick-with unfortuatley the beautiful and smart heroinne backing down to being hopelessly in love wtih a jerk. The backgounds are beautiful especially if you love to cook, love to eat and drink wine. Most impressive was the music. Very catchy, brazilian-play it want you want to get that special someone in the mood!"
3,HELP!,"There is a wonderful spanish guitar solo in this film that is NOT on the soundtrack -- I found it once online, but sadly I cannot find it again! Does anyone know it...??"
5,Great music!,"I recently went to see this movie shortly after it opened, and despite the fact that the movie is by no means stellar (pleasantly sweet and rather cliche), what really struck me was the music. I purchased the soundtrack on the way home; that's how great it is. The collection of music contained on this CD is so good, I include it in the only three CDs that I love to listen to repeatedly, and have yet to tire of (see Facing Future by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole by Play by Moby). I rarely find CDs worth a 5-star recommendation."
3,3.5 stars if I could,"Good music, easy to listen to a few times but not over and over like some of the pagode, more Bossa Nova."
3,"Love the show, not the dvd's.","I love Home Improvement, have been a fan since it was originally on tv. I had big problems when I went to watch the dvd though. Season 6 & 7 have let me down. Season 6 the dvd wouldn't work. Season 7 has had problems as well. I couldn't choose the play all option otherwise it would freeze, no biggie I will just select each episode, but then during the show it would skip, very bad skips, you miss a lot of the episode it happens to. I love the show, just not impressesed with the dvd. I will have to return this item and hopefully the replacement will work, otherwise I'm going somewhere else for my season 7."
4,A Television Classic WInds Down,"My wife loves ""Home Improvement"". I don't know if it's because she has a real deep connection with Jill (what does that say about my home improvement jobs?) but because she enjoys it so much we have bought all seasons up to seven.The seventh season is not nearly as good as the early years but what sitcom ever is? Even in decline ""Home Improvement"" would rule the TV airwaves because of the lack of a good clean, family-centered, funny show on TV.The fact that 2 and 1/2 Men has any ratings at all shows how far we've fallen since Home Improvement has been on the air."
3,Great Show-low quality DVD,This is our favorite show; however the DVD's seem to run in like a slow motion almost as if it has been poorly copied. The show is still funny as ever but the quality takes a little bit away from the enjoyment.
5,Great season as usual,"If you love Home Improvement like I do you must get this season, along with every other season as well!!"
2,Dark Night of the soul,"Wasn't what I expected, filled with mostly quotes from Bible and very little of anything about the Spiritual Journey through the Dark Night of the Soul"
1,"Not the Best Portrayal,where are you Buddy Edelen?","Billy Mills was an inspiration to many of us distance runners, there is no disputing this. This movie however tended to dwell too much on his being part Native American. Do we really need to hear a reporter say, "" Billy, did you lose the race because you are an Indian?"" Other moments in the the film are at best laughable: Billy's girlfriend says- ""I've never been to a track meet before""- when they are at a Cross Country Meet! Finally look closely at the infield of the track at the '64 Olympics which were held in Tokyo, you can see the yard markings from the football field where the movie was shot in Southern Cal. By the way, D.S. Everett did not allow his name to run in the credits because he was upset with decisions made by the producers."
4,"poignancy, athleticism, cultural bias and victory",a thoughtful motion picture of personal trials and triumph. This film deserves a dvd release.
5,Wonderful!,"Watch this movie once and, over the years, you will watch it again and again. I'm sure even the great Billy Mays himself has been, and continues to be, touched by such a cinematic tribute."
5,A girl who falls in love with a guy.,"This book takes place at Winnetka, Illinois. It's about a girl who goes to Paris and changes her looks and everything. She goes back home, and her crush and she goes out with him. I thought this book was a really good book, because I thought it was romantic and it is interesting."
4,great book,"the first few chapters of the book is a bunch of letters from ""GIGI"" or Gerolyn while shes in Paris and the second part of the book is told from her point of view. It is really romantic."
4,Good Show!,"I like Kirby Grant, first saw him in Sky King as a kid. He did well in the triple adventure on this disc. The picture is quite good."
4,a well-organized introduction to policy studies,"Weimer's ""Policy Analysis -3rd edition"" provides a well-organized, widely-covered, and easily-understandable introduction to policy analysis. Although we have to seek for other materials for an in-depth analysis of some topics, the book helps us start with Public Policy, Policy Analysis, and even economic policies. This is especially good for undergraduate level, since this provides how to study, investigate, and write policy paper."
5,Great overview of policy analysis,"I read this book for a class and it gives a fantastic overview of the basics of policy analysis. It discusses the reasons for government intervention in markets, the analysis of policies and ways of going about doing a thorough policy analysis. Easy to read and very informative!"
5,GREAT TRANSACTION!,I was pleased with the purchase. The item came fast and in the promised condition.
1,Disappointed,I paid for expedited shipping with the expectation that it would arrive in the estimated delivery time. I contacted the seller and was informed that their shipping department made an error and sent it through media mail. After almost a month of waiting on the textbook it has still NOT arrived.
3,It's the best of one,"I purchased this tutorial because it's the only reference manual available for Ableton Live. Beggers can't be choosers.It's called ""Live 2 Power"" and I had just bought LIVE 3.0. But I needed help, and Dave Hill has a corner on the market. He introduces himself right off in the introduction as a drummer, which obliges me to excuse the redundancy and the lack of literary flow.Aside from that blunt criticism, I can't think of anyone better to write this book, since he's way crazy about Ableton. He has ample humor (which I almost require when working with computer technology), and brings in enough tricks and techniques from pros that the book is kept interesting throughout. And it's fairly exhaustive, in a good way.There are new tutorials coming out soon, but with some changes for 3.0+, and the help of a decent proof reader, Hill's book should be viable for years to come."
1,Song Titles Unlisted Therefor Unrated,"I have purchased many CDs and books from Amazon;however, I am unwilling to gamble $27.95 on a CD that this vendor is unwilling to at least list data regarding the songs. Finally, Amazon should realize if we cannot hear the music before purchasing the chance that the sale will be consumated are reduced considerably. As a compromise perhaps Amazon could direct us to a site that does provide this service."
1,Would have been great... if it had lasted,"I was very pleased with this phone system for about 6 months. I even liked it enough that I was planning to buy more handsets and make this the primary phone system in our house. It's a good thing I waited. Both handsets suddenly stopped transmitting voice or key presses - you could hear a dial tone, but could not dial the phone. Also, you could answer the phone and hear the caller speaking, but they could not hear you.We tried disconnecting the system overnight and re-connecting it, and it worked perfectly again... for about 1 day."
2,Not a good over the long run,Our phone system came with 2 handsets. I bought this phone based on very positive experiences from owning GE phones during my college years (~20 years ago). It has some nice features on each handset such as speakerphone and caller ID.The problem I had with each phone is the poor quality battery. The phones are just over a year old and batteries in one of the handsets is not holding the charge for more than 10 minutes of talk time. Of course the warranty is 12 months.The phone's fit and finish is much poorer on this phone than the GE phones during my college years. One of my friends told me that Thompson bought GE's consumer electronics about 10 years ago and reduced their quality standards.
2,Annoying!,"I would love to return this item but it is too late.Everything works fine with this phone, but the problem is its annoying answering system! The lady's voice kills me! And it is extremely repetitive! Get to the point lady! I wish I could just hit a button and hear my new messages, not be told 15 times that I'm listening to ""New - Message - One"" etc."
5,"Intelligent, Hilarious Flick",This is a great independent film with the sort of wit and dark humor that makes every viewing a terrific experience. Brilliant direction and a wonderful cast. I highly recommend it.
4,Worth watching more than once,"A movie that must be watched at least twice to get all the nuances. Very enjoyable. could be the next cult movie. Buy it, take it home become a part of it."
1,Why the $$$? When you can watch it on tv?,"I think it nowhere near even struck the middle ground. I mean if your idea of instruction is watching and listening to some blonde going OOOO! ...... AAAAAHHH! just 'cause she caught a fish (the first six fish caught on the DVD were by her and not the instructor)maybe you should check out some other web sites. The copy for this DVD is misleading. They only mentioned and showed pictures of 2 flys. The info. on float tubes was minimal. There just wasn't much instruction. I'm glad most of the money for this was a gift, since you can't return DVD's. If you want a deal, I'm putting it on Ebay tommorow!"
2,disappointed,I thought this dvd was more instruction than wathching a couple of people fish for rainbows .I was looking for a beginner dvd .Also this dvd did not play on my home system only on my laptop.So if you buy this be ready to return it if it does not play.
4,How To Fly Fish Series - Lakes,This DVD was just what I was looking for in teaching me to fish lakes. I really liked the segment on the bugs. Two thumbs up!
5,This is good solid instruction!,"This is one of several DVD's I received as a gift recently and since I've been fly fishing for quite sometime, i was a little concerned that this might be too basic. What i found was an excellent program about how to fly fishing for trout in western lakes.Bill Marts is an excellent instructor, and his fishing firend, who apparently are also the producers of the DVD are accomplieshed without coming off as ""know it alls"".I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to expand their knowledge of fly fishing in still water.One other note, I particularly like the entomology section."
4,Nice Product,"Everything about this product is good and meant for SDA, with the eception of manufacturer didn't bother to give a provision for a Joystick which SDA has. Once has to cut a whole in the plastic to use SDA JoyStick. Certainly nice product for this price."
1,Out of reality,The film is made as it is stone ages with modern outlook. It is not worth to spend your time watching such film. Japanese cartoon style.
1,Boring,I was very disappointed with this purchase. The film is rather dull and more toward the opposite of provocative. I would not recommend this video nor any of its subsidiaries.
3,Lost History of San Francisco Crime Fighter,"Historical book on Detective Lees and many of the crimes of that era, as well as a taste of the founding and development of San Francisco. For a historical it isn't dry reading and I do recommend it.However, the book isn't polished. I feel that it was almost there, as if it needed one more editing pass. How information was grouped into chapters is unclear. Many items seemed as if thrown in just to get them in the book. Some items were referenced multiple times without any reason for the additional reference. The author would mention Lees as Lees then other times as Isaiah, making the reader wonder if it was two different people. Many chapters end awkwardly making them seem unfinished. Some of the most interesting crimes are passed over too quickly. That said, the book is good for bringing to life the era, the man and the crimes. I was surprised that I had never heard of Lees before."
4,A must for GM H-Special bodied car owners.,"There are many aftermarket service manuals covering GM's H body cars, but this is the only aftermarket service manual (that I'm aware of) that also covers GM's H-Special body hatchbacks and notchbacks.If you don't have a factory service manual for your 1975-80 Monza, Sunbird, Starfire, or Skyhawk, then you should have this manual."
5,Classic 70s-Style Songwriting,"I was a little apprehensive about buying this album, but I needn't have worried... without sounding out-of-date, Mr O'Sullivan has managed to pull off a great album full of quirky/happy/melancholy, sing-along songs with his own brand of '70s styling.If you have ever been a fan of his earlier works then you won't be disappointed with this offering. How does he manage to keep up the quality after all this time? I can't wait for his next album, now..."
4,Great album!,"I have become a Sebadoh fan only recently after Harmacy blew me away so I've had to go back and buy their older stuff. I was happy to find that Bubble & Scrape is just as good, if not better than Harmacy. It is easily one of their best albums. Barlow's amazing songwriting shines through on the great tracks like Soul and Fire, Cliche, and, Think. Lowenstein also contributes some memorable tracks. Happily Divided is a standout. Where this album losses a perfect score is in Gaffey's tracks. They are mostly directionless Sonic Youth type noise experiments that go nowhere. These tracks sometimes make the album frustrating and hard to listen to, but the good tracks certainly out weigh the bad. This album hasn't left my cd player since I bought it."
3,more diverse than ever,"This is the weirdest sebadoh album. Especially all of eric's song. Jason has a few weird ones too. And as usual lou, mellows things out. butthis album split apart three songwriters into one musical mirage of sounds. the album starts off with two from barlow, two from gaffney, and then two from loewenstein. and then goes back to barlow and the rest in that order again. except for the end then it's a little different.its kinda like three seperate albums. its all over the place and pretty crazy. im still getting used to it. harmacy is by far my favorite. but bubble and scrap is there when i need a break from the other ones."
2,Anti-fog??,The first few days this product worked fine without causing any fog when a mask is worn but now it fogs all the time. Kind of a waste of money
2,Scratched,"I buy my husband absolutely everything that dewalt makes. Up to this point we have been so extremely happy with everything. But these safety glasses were the least expensive thing I've ever bought him, don;t get me wrong we bought love the product. My problem is there is a whole lot of little scatches on one of the frames and there shouldn't be I had to open the package to see the scrathes. The cost and time to ship back is just ridiculous but I am upset, cuz that should of been checked before they were shipped. I believe amazon should make it right and send him another pair that are not scratched."
1,Very UnHappy,I was looking very excited about these glasses. I have purcheased many dewaltproducts and these broke in the first week. very disapointed!P.s no e-mail 821-5151
3,Normal Satety Glasses,"This is not that impressive. Apparently there is vision distortion as others mentioned in the reviews. I have no idea how helpful anti-fog feature is, but do not expect perfect fog-free - it sometimes gets foggy. The length-adjustable leg tips are just simple plastics and extend about 1/4"" max. It's light and comfortable to wear though."
3,OK,Probably not worth the money. If I had to do it again I'd buy 4 dollar geeky safety goggles. These are not that much more comfortable.
3,"Does the protection job, but no anti-fog.","Fits well, light weight, and sturdy construction. I started using this after I got hit in eye while playing badminton. Does the projection part well, i.e., I can keep my eye on the bird without fear of getting hit, but still have issues with fogging. A few minutes into play and all I can see is mist on the glass. Decent for the price, but not anti-fog for sure."
5,Great,No complaints. I love the anti-fog feature and they're very comfortable. They dont cover as much as some of the other safety glasses I used although I havent had anything fly in my eyes yet
5,amazing,love these glasses. very comfortable and stable worn them since i got them n they are great. they don't fog up on me and i work in a very hot place (roasting coffee).
4,Poor packageing follow-thru,I loved these light-weight great fitting glasses. The only problem was that the packaging scuffed/damaged the lenses in a couple of places.
2,They're okay ...,"The glasses are okay, but they have significant optical distortion. They would be a value at $5.00, but I would not recommend them at this price point."
5,Great safety classes,"I use these glasses when dealing with microorganisms (bacteria) inside a labratory. These glasses are clear and haven't fogged up on me. My only complaint is that the glasses do not come with a case, which would allow me to carry them inside my scrub a bit better. Other than that, these are great safety glasses for most laboratory settings"
5,The best style ever,"Look no further if you want a pair of safety glasses. These glasses are very comfortable thanks to the two way adjustable earpieces and the adjustable soft rubber nose piece. The anti-fogging feature works well, even when wearing a dust mask, and all that exhaled air goes straight up. They're not scratch resistant, but also don't seem to scratch easily. I wore these almost daily all summer, and they're still in good condition."
2,Not very scratch resistant.,"When I received this both the left and right lens in the same spot were already scratched. It looks like the clamshell packaging it came in was rubbing against the lens and caused the damage. The lack of proper delivery packaging probably caused it or made it worse, because the box it was delivered in was with a bulk purchase includng other items. The box was too big and everything must have bounced around during transit encouraging damage.Concluding the glasses are not very durable to resist scratching."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Great for light use. Light weight, comfortable etc. Lenses do not hold up well. Light scratches after 4 days did not drop, just from setting on desk, and in pockets. Hilti glasses lasted 7 months... The Dewalts Fogged up on humid day multiple times. Not happy with product, but I was being cheap and I got what I paid for."
3,Good but not great,The highlights of the gladiators were given but nothing of real depth.The History Channel could have put out something better especially knowing there were gladiator games for nearly a thousand years.
5,Big help learning about Gladiators.,This movie was a big help for my granddaughter's History class. My granddaughter recommended it to her classmates...History's Mysteries - The True Story of Gladiators (History Channel)this was a worthwhile purchase.
3,Easy to use,"I didn't read this book, I saw it because a friend that was looking for a college to study. Of course, no one will ever read it all! It's a list of colleges (the title say that) but is very well organize and easy to use. I'm not a reader of lists, but I like this one."
3,Misleading color but decent product for the price,"I ordered this to cover the electrical box in my basement. The flag was shipped quickly and was the perfect size to cover the hole in the wall. The only reason I give this three stars is because the color is a lot more of a green than a blue, but I don't really mind since I wasn't trying to match anything closely. Also know that the material is rather thin so I would not use this outside at all but for what I needed it for it is perfect!"
5,Buy it and fly it PROUDLY,"AMAZINGLY fast delivery! GREAT Peace Sign flag, it flies proudly on my pole lit up by solar ball light string top to bottom of pole vertically. In less than a week since flying it 2 different neighbors actually came to my door to tell me how much they like it. Me too, very happy, wish that's all it took to stop the madness that is war....."
5,Read Me Before Ordering,"""Jeeves in the Offing"" was originally published in the United Staes as ""How Right You Are Jeeves"" and is still being sold under that title. Although a wonderful and humorous book you may want to know that before ordering. Since I did not know this I ended up with two copies of the same book. And yes, the book does get five stars."
4,Good,"Good entertainment, cute graphics, easy to understand controls, suited for a range of ages, only the youngest may need a little help."
1,Terrible,"This is amateurish on every level. The ""documentary"" is nothing more than someone with a camcorder claiming every noise, blur, shadow and fallen branch has something to do with bigfoot. The book ""The Mogollon Monster - Arizona's Bigfoot"" may be the worst book ever written on the subject as well. These ""docs"" are for completionists only and to be brutally honest add absolutely nothing to any legitimate research on the subject. At least Tom Biscardi productions offer some sort of entertaining value."
2,"More like ""Story Time"" than a Bigfoot Documentary !!!","This looks like it was geared towards Grade School Kids.I thought I was watching a Story Recital where an Adult Read to Kids with Still Photos and Maps. The Actual Cam Footage was annoying to watch due to the distortion and moving about and the VHS Footage was not tracked right leaving a static line in the upper area of the picture.This wasn't the worst Bigfoot Documentary that I watched but it isn't the Best Either.The Supposed Researchers should invest in better camcorders or at least modern ones.These Old Camcorders that were used, are terrible on the viewer.The running time is 59 Min."
4,For Small Things,"If you're as dimension challenged as I am, I want you to know this is small. It's great for a few peppercorns or a handful of herbs, but if you want to do any quantities of nuts or a salsa preparation, you should look for a larger one. It's pretty on the counter, doesn't take up much room, and it's of good quality, so I'll keep it."
4,Functional and aesthetically pleasing,I purchased this Mortar and Pestle about a week ago and have no regets. The price is right and this is a very nice peice. I have used it only a couple of times to grind my dogs medicine but it has worked great for that. Mostly I purchased this just because I enjoy the look of it. It is worth the price very heavy duty and crafted extremely well. If there is a complaint to be had it is that the bowl is very shallow.
3,"Great look, but smaller than I expected","Made in Taiwan.The red marble looks great and seems to be excellent quality, but the size was much smaller than I expected.Dimensions:Pestle - approximately 4"" long - 1/4"" wide at the top of handle - 1"" wide at the grinding baseMortar - inside cup grinding area - approximately 1 1/2"" deep - 1 1/2"" wide inside bottom - 2 1/4"" wide inside topThe pestle is too short for my hand and I have an ever size female hand. I find myself pushing the pestle with the center palm of my hand and it hurts my palm. If I wrap my hand around the pestle, then my fingers hit the insides of the mortar.The mortar is smaller than I expected and the spices shoot and spill over the sides. Depending on the spice, I can only grind about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of spice at a time. I have to keep one hand over the mortar (while grinding) to keep the contents inside.It grinds my spices with ease, but it is just too small for me. I would give this 5 stars if the pestle and mortar were larger."
3,servlets,Rather primitive text. I doubt anybody could really learn enough from the book to program something beyond oversimplified useless applications.
3,"Dated and contrived, but also a lot of fun....","This feels unbelievably dated. A great concept, but such an artifact of the late 1990's. The costumes, the dialogue, the lack of teeth. Busiek is still clever enough to make it interesting, and the origin story alone is worthwhile. Busiek's talent (""Marvels"", ""Astro City"") is to show how the 'man on the street' reacts to the superhero, and although that's a great fit with the concept, it doesn't feel like enough to keep this fresh.By the end of the fourth issue, things were starting to feel a little contrived. I'm interested enough to keep going - but I'm expecting to see a lot of changes."
2,Outdated,"In recent years there has been a great deal of work done on the Picts and the Scots, but you won't learn anything about that work here. There's nothing much wrong with the book, it is short and readable, but it is seriously outdated. The consensus of opinion on many questions has changed a great deal since the early 1990s, and much that was taken for granted is now rejected or questioned.For a more up-to-date picture, the 2004 edition of Sally Foster's Picts, Gaels and Scots is worth considering."
3,Ok,Not really what I expected from Ken Follet. Still I think each reader should give their opinion. Not every one has the same taste.
5,Insightful & Intriguing!,"Kelly Simons truly captures the spirit of one Wisconsin family during the early 1930's. I came across ""Leona's Legacy"" through a relative. My grandmother ""Margie"" is in Chapter 4 of Kelly's novel. I couldn't be more pleased to see my grandmother's spirit live on through memories of a distant relative. Simons does a beautiful job bringing these characters to life!"
5,"Got hooked on ""Monarch of the Glen""","Having lived in England for a few years and having cousins who live in both England and Scotland, I got hooked from Series 1. I am now on the last season and hate to see it end. I highly recommend ""Monarch of the Glen."
4,Great BBC,"A great Series, however I did not like the ending, seemed to much, too fast and left me feeling incomplete. Too bad the first Couple left so soon, I felt that could have been explored further, it was almost like two separate series and the spontaneity was lost. The series introduced me to the beauty of Scotland hidden in it's Glens."
3,"Monarch of The Glen, series 7","With the last 3 series, (5,6,7) major cast changes were made. That in and of itself wasn't to bad but the thread of the story was rushed, often times incomplete leaving a viewer wondering what was going on or asking themselves did we miss something. Would not recommend."
1,IT DOES NOT WORK !!!!!,"I was really looking forward to see this DVD, but it does not work. I live in Norway and my DVD-player does not accept the USA/Canda sone. On the DVD cover it says for sale in the USA and Canada only!!!!!!!!!"
5,Orishas... Una manera diferente de expresiÃ³n cubana!!,Definitivamente esta selecciÃ³n de canciones me encantÃ³. No tenÃ­a tanta canciones de esta agrupaciÃ³n y al escuchar esta selecciÃ³n de lo mejor de ellos me di cuenta de lo excelente que son.
1,don't waste your time or money,"I purchased this movie believing that it would be of some nice eye candy. As it turned out, it was completely boring, nothing simulating at all. There were two guys that were hott out of the 5 of them, but still, nothing exciting on the screen that would make me want to continue to watch. I believe, if I feel embarassed to watch the scene, then it's good. Then it's expressing the correct feel for a sex scene. These immitations of horse play were just boring and unappealing. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie. Save your money."
1,Unacceptable technical quality,"This doesn't look as having been shot in 1996! One can guess either the use of a primitive VHS camera, or perhaps a better one, whose material has been miserably transferred to DVD. With my SONY Handycam I an reach 10 times better results. AMAZON should warn customers on the inferior quality of this product. We are in the 21st Century now and even porn producing companies supply better material. A pity for the good models and good intentions of the producers."
2,it is not as hyped as descibed by the plot,this mmovie shows this group of friends go to a pond and strip and swim and nothing else dose not show any love interest and has a music that maakes you want to sleep rather than watching the rest it is not worth the amount for shipping plus the coverlet it is hotter than the movie it self
2,size does matter,"It's not 50 minutes long, it's only 35. If it were longer I'd like it but, as is, it's much too short for me!"
4,this product should have came with my fISHFINDER,"This cover is great it fits and keeps my screen safe when the unit is rolling around my truck. However, it does suck that it didnt come with the unit. I mean someone gave me a case for my 100dollar sunglasses when I bought them, you'd think they could throw one cover in when you buy a 500dollar fishfinder. I would think it would save alot of trees and petrolium if they did'nt send the cover with 22 pounds of garbage paper and plastic. (Yes plastic is mainly a petrol product) So if I were HUMMINBIRD I would stick one of these in every depth finder box you sell and mark the unit price up a few bucks. I ain't no hippie but between the unit cover and the mount cover thats more garbage than the unit box. its stupid. how you derin?"
4,Good Clark Quality... sizing a bit large,"Nice construction, and quality materials. With other brands, this size fits fine. With the Clark, it's a bit too big. Now I wear with thick socks, and it's acceptable."
2,Shoes are extremely heavy,I have these shoes and after a few weeks they began to KILL my feet becuase the shoes are extremely heavy. They felt comfortable initally but got very bad as time went one! Be careful
5,an excellent blade,"this blade is awesome.its my second best blade out of my 4, just behind driger f.i find that if u swap around m.draciel weight disk with driger.f urv got one sweet blade.this is the the best master u can get.it deflects anything and just spins around until the other blade stops spinning"
5,M--DRACIEL!!!,"This is a cool blade.It has a cool atk ring & a highly endurance base.This babe here can crack up any blades as & when it likes.Mine can roar around the stadium or just stay in the middle.I reccomend this blade,well thats all bye!"
3,For a Piece Of Plastic?,"Kept the kids interested for 10 minutes, 2 minutes longer than most toys of this nature. A lot of money for a piece of plastic."
4,A real good Blade!,"This was my first beyblade ever. I battled som people but i didn't win that much. But when my blades pin thingie at the bottom was wering down i shaved all the plastic off and stuck a pin there instead and now its heaps cool.Add a pin to the bottom and it wil attack more and with a wide attack ring no blade can escape but if u want 2 keep the blades endurace dont do this overall this is my 3rd best blade the best combination with master draciel is attack ring:Galman's,Galleon's or Galzzy weight disk:Master draciel or Dragoon storm and Left spin gear Base:Draciel s or Metal draCIEL i hav tried it and it is totally wicked!"
1,Unreliable!!,"Broke 3 times the first day, while working on a hot roof, 12 miles from a hardware store! I will never buy Irwin again! My last one lasted 25 years, it is sheer incompetence to make a piece of string that breaks this easily."
4,Tuneflex - recommend,Easy to install and works great with the cassette adapter. The amp. boost feature and level sound could not work better. The one small problem is the 30 GB ipod does not fit tight and on bumpy roads causes the sound to go in and out.
1,Absolute Junk - Broken within minutes,This thing moves and wobbles and turns and absolutely will not hold my ipod classic. While trying to set it up right it snapped at the base completely ruining it. I suppose you might like it if you have a lighter ipod like the nano but for me this was a giant pain in the ###. I'm glad I only spent 10 bucks on it instead of 30 or 50.Don't waste your money.
2,Product misses the mark,"Product is OK. Quality is excellent. The extension arm is simply not long enough for my car, a 4-door sedan."
2,Creates noise in Playback,"I received the TuneFlex Aux (Griffen 9557-5GTFAUX) as a Christmas present to go with my iPod Touch. I like the product design, as it held the iPod well and seemed nicely designed. Unfortunately, using the TuneFlex introduced low-end background noise to my playback that is not present when I connect the iPod directly to the Aux jack in my Saab 9-3. Without the TuneFlex, the sound is crystal clear. With the TuneFlex, it is awful. I also checked out the sound with just a power adapter to the iPod, which was also fine. I think I've isolated the TuneFlex as the cause, and it's going back."
1,Chinese flakeboard for Dogs,"Save your money, these are awful, they actually fall apart in a millionpieces like particleboard..... made in china. surprise!"
5,sonic explosion,"this is one of the most tigh dvd concerts you'll ever see.the MOST original band in the universe (FANTOMAS), meets ONE OF THE MOST underrated band of the last 30 years (THE MELVINS), for a sonic explosion with cool/original photography editing (nice visuals).your ears have never heard this, and your eyes will see the making of a MUSIC-FRANKENSTEIN."
1,Terrible!,"As other reviewers have noted, this is a terrible product. It is flimsy and it actually BROKE the first time I used it. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy!"
1,Horrible!,I had the misfortune of recieving this food processor as a mothers day gift. This is by far the worst piece of junk I have ever seen. It looks like a toy and about as powerful as one. The design is awkward and is totally flimsy. I couldn't even sell this at a yard sale for $3.00. Some people were even laughing at me for even owning this food processor. I ended up tossing it out.
1,DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,I LOVE Rachel Ray's shows recipes & ideas!!! First time I used it was to grate cheese. VERY FLIMSY!! It actually MELTED & BROKE! DO NOT BUY THIS! No replacement parts are avalible. I am disappointed to have this quality come from her name.
4,First one - Great start,"This is my first food processor. I love it, though I do agree the parts aren't that great, and the bowl seems a bit cheap. I use it instead of my blender; it's so much faster.I think it's a great start, and a good intro to what I'd buy in the future. Do any food processors get down to the very bottom of the container? This one doesn't do that."
3,Rachael Rays food processor review,This food processor is fine. The only thing that I don't like is it seems to leak when filled to it's said capacity. It leaks out of the screwed on lid when processing. But it is minor and everything else is nice. It chops great and blends great. So wiping up a little after words isn't really that big of a deal.
4,Genie garage door opener,Easy to set-up and works great. I wish the feel of the buttons would be better but not a show-stopper.
5,Garage Door outdoor remote keypad,Genie GWKIC garage door opener keypad Intellicode openerThe delivery was very quick and the unit works flawlessly. Good vendor and great service!
1,Genie Keyless Entry,This item was advertised to work with all Models of Intellicode Door Openers. My Genie Door Opener was one of the models listed and the keyless entry pad could not be programed to operate the door. I even went to the Genie web site and went through their troubleshooting tips with the same results. The models listed in their advertising needs to be updated with correct models compatibility listed.
4,Keyless entry pad,The unit was easily installed and easy to set the door open codes. The unit's construction is flimsy plastic but it does what it is supposed to do so I have no complaints.
5,Genie Garage Door Opener,"Simple to install, simple to program, works great. My wife and I said we should have purchased this years ago - very convenient"
1,"Broken product, no refunds!!??","I recieved a completely broken item, and recieved no customer service, until finally they told me I couldn't get a refund. Please stay away from this store, and tell anyone you know to stay away as well."
5,great,8 simple rules is one of the best shows that I have ever seen. This DVD is my tribute to John Ritter.
4,awesome show,I loved this show - the first season was probably the best. I wish it had some additional bonus features (it just has a blooper reel). But its definitely worth what I paid.
5,perfectly cast comedy,"If you live in the UK, you probably think, ""What's the point of buying this on DVD?"". ABC1 show this constantly, so just switch on the TV! However, what a really pleasant surprise, having put the DVD in, to see that it's in widescreen. ABC1 live in the past and broadcast in 4:3 format. Plus they seem to show them out of sequence a lot of the time. This is a great show; a perfectly cast comedy with `serious' parts intertwined, that only US TV does well. Having said that, this is possibly the closest to a UK family comedy I've seen from the US. If you like this series, and live in the UK, buy it to watch it how it should be viewed. I think it went off a bit in season 3, but I'm really looking forward to season 2 being released (please!)."
2,Be Careful!,"Cute, nice looking, light weight bowls. But beware, you cannot put them in the microwave, they are only oven-safe because of a metal rim they have. To small to mix things in. Really could only be used for food storage, but not for reheating. I wouldn't recommend."
4,"Mostly cooks, but some weak moments","I got introduced to the Rev. Horton Heat about ten years ago, and recently picked up this CD. Thought it was great then, and I'm glad to say, still gets me going. The Texas punked-up rockabilly pretty much cooks throughout this CD until the end, when it sort of runs out of gas and degenerates into filler.Those of you, such as myself, not into sophomoric lyrics will want to pass on ""Wiggle Stick"", a pointless ode to a critical part of his anatomy and ""400 Bucks"".But all in all, a pretty rockin' good time."
3,"variable, from fantastic to boring","loaded gun is one of my all time favorites, since i saw the movie love & a 45, but the tracks on this album varies too much for my taste, though it varies from brilliant to boring and that's saying something..."
4,now THIS is rockin!!,"Modern Rock n Roll at it's finest!! The Rev is one of the best ever!! And this is one of his (their?) finest moments!! Its a lot better then their very recent stuff, i think. This has more of a classic Rockabilly style to it, which I prefer."
5,love it!,"Great product!! I have been having hard time finding materials to trace my patterns. Tracing paper doesn't show up too well on certain materials and takes a long time, chalk is too messy and creates a thick line, but this-is super easy to use, really fast, thin line, and easy to see on fabrics like wool, especially if there's some sort of pattern that makes tracing paper harder to see. I have used yellow color so far and loved it, going to try other colors now. The only thing about it is that once in a while you need to gently shake/tap it to let the powder get down to the wheel, but so far- no complaints. We'll see how they last in the long run."
5,a staple for anyone who sews,"I've tried a few different types of fabric chalk--but they either snagged fabric, stained the fabric, made sloppy lines, or were practically invisible. This, on the other hand, provides crisp visible lines that wipe off easily. The design is ingenious--the stylus dispenses loose chalk through a precise wheel, making curves and straight lines easy to draw."
4,Glad I ordered it,I haven't used this color as of yet but glad I went ahead and ordered it just in case I ever need it.
3,Recommended on a sewing site,I have not used yet but will be needing it to work on a quilt. Can tell more after that.
5,Best chalk markers for sewing and crafts!,"I have used ALL types of chalk and pencil markers in my years of sewing and quilting! With pencils and chalk type markers, I experienced constant breakage or the need to sharpen frequently. These markers are precise and very easy to use. Excellent shape and size adds to ease of use. I now own these in ALL colors made! No more chalk or pencils for me, these are simply the best markers out there."
4,Great for when you need a very fine line,"I'm pretty old school when it comes to my sewing tools, so I've been using the same little square of tailors chalk for years (what can I same the stuff lasts forever). Lately, I've been doing a lot of pattern reconstruction and altering so the thick line from my nubs of tailors chalk don't give me the precise markings I need. I decided to invest in this pen style and it's working out great. I find mysef using it for all my markings now. The one negative I've found is that because the line is so thin it disappears rather quickly from some fabrics."
3,yellow can be difficult to see,"i bought this chaco liner after using one that my friend has in a silver color. i figured the yellow would show up just as well, since it's a light color, but i find it more difficult to see. if i were to do it again, i'd probably go with the silver color. other than that, it's a nice chalk liner with a cartridge that lays chalk down in a line, which makes it easy to use, and it won't tug on the fabric the way a pencil will as you draw. solid product overall."
4,"not bad, mr. o's","I used to consider dressing myself like the man on the cover of this cd, Gilbert O'Sullivan. I soon realized that even when he was doing this in the early 70s it looked hopelessly ridiculous and was best left to period movies, which serve the need vicariously.Listening to this album is a bit of a trip in time too, particularly to heady days when Paul McCartney's solo/Wings work was beginning gain dominance. G O'S's songs have a few of Paul's mannerisms here, and tho' quite in tune with Paul's work, it is distinctive, holding its own.Highlights include: ""Nothing Rhymed"", ""Matrimony"", ""Houdini Said"", ""If I Don't Get You Back Again"", and the last song, which bizarrely reminds me of the tv cartoon Arthur: ""Doing the Best that I Can"" with its nonsense chorus.A good album for those who like off-kilter singer/songwriter/piano-player songs that are sometimes ridiculous, sometimes incredibly touching."
2,Poor Quality,"Received mine today, broken. The front metal panel is very flimsy and the plastic on the sides is thin and breaks easily. The plastic handle on the backside nearly fell out of the unit when I picked it up. Definitely not recommended."
5,Superb Watch,"Typical of Citizen this reflects their excellent quality and style. It's everything they claim. Style of course is a personal choice, I like this watch . . . being good looking and conservative in style.Nothing more to say other than; ""another good watch from Citizen""."
4,Watch,Nice watch for the price. Classic styling that i was looking for. Very lightweight though which makes it feel inexpensive (ironically it was inexpensive!).
5,Good watch,The free shipping is not slow. 4 days earlier than the earliest estimated arrival time. Excellent performance/price ratio.
3,Decent watch,"The watch is decent, would have made a nice gift but the day was in another language. Also, had difficulty changing the day/date."
3,good ideas,some excellent excercises to do that really help muscles needed in riding but the book is hard to follow day by day and some of them you really do need fancy machines to get real benefit
4,Exercises For Riding,Love the day to daychanges in routine. A little disappointed that some of the exercises need gym equipment to be effective.
5,A Great Guide,"I really like this book! i have just flipped through it since it arrived today and look forward to reading and doing the exercises in this book.i would suggest that you had a gym membership because i find the equitment they say a basic gym should have, wouldn't be very pratical to have in an every day household.i also like this book because it covers all areas of riding. so barrel racers, pleasure riders, hunter jumpers, dressage, trail riders, etc.there are 74 exercises that work your whole body and it tells you why its important. theres also liek the title suggets a weekly log that tells you what areas to work kinda. :)every rider should own this book!"
4,Statistics for People Who Hate Statistics,"When people ask me about statistics, my typical response is, ""I must have been sick the day that was taught"" - because even after 2-3 statistics classes in college (which I did okay in), the whole statistical topic remains elusive for me. I bought this book as much for myself as for the people who I work with. This book was immensely helpful for me, and as much helped me with the general understanding of statistics, as well as the benefits of applying statistics in the workplace. After a couple of scans of the book, it actually gave me the confidence to write a short white paper on regression analysis and correlation for my professional association. A good investment, with content written in plain English (mostly)."
1,A textbook that I could not use,"I purchased this book by mistake. I needed the other book, but I got this one. It was of no use in this course."
4,"Good story, slightly weak history","This book was a very enjoyable read. It tells a story that has been, unfortunately, left out of most of our history books. The author tells the story very well. He writes in a very compelling manner.Unfortunately, there are no maps in the book so you are forced to rely on the authors descriptive powers (great, but not the same as a decent map) to set the scene and understand the movements & placement of units. The author also leaves out those unit designations that allow us military history nuts to track which squad belonged to which platoon, etc. (no offense to the other reviewer, I'd just like to see a bit of balance).This story could stand the sort of film treatment that ""The Lost Battalion"" received from A&E.Now, someone needs to write a book about the other American troops on the other side of the USSR. Also a book about the Czech army fighting it's way across the length of the Soviet Union during, and after, WWI."
4,Good Card Good Price,Good Mini SD great price also and as always amazon great with getting it to me in a timely manner.
4,SanDisk Mini 2.0 GB,The item arrived as advertised and at the priced shown online. It worked the first time without difficult installation.
1,I am very angry.,"I dont know why or how but about a week after I got this item in the mail I put it into my phone, put a few songs on it, then all of a sudden it just stops working all together. When I put it into my computer the computer doesnt even notice that it is there. The same goes for my cell phone. I hope there is some way of either 1. Fixing it 2. Getting a new one from you guys or 3. Getting my money back because I definately got ripped off."
2,SanDisk Mini SD Card,"I was never able to get it to work as 2G. It wouldn't format for it. Also, not too many devices support 2G at this point, so - buy 1G and save 2/3 of the price..."
4,ok...,"Since I was invited to write this review:It's small, it's 2GB, it's a Mini SD, it's reliable and it's cheap (I remember the days when I paid $755 for a 45MB hard-drive that was bigger and heavier than both my notebook computers combined).'nuff said ;-)"
1,Liked it WHILE it worked,"After using this mini SD card in my smartphone for 10 months it quit working. I had a local computer store test it - ""it's dead."" I would have expected it to last longer than that. I thought SanDisk was a top quality name brand but I'm not sure I can bring myself to buy another SanDisk product. I think that with SD cards they either work or they don't. There's not much else to rate."
4,Sandisk mini,Excellent speed and space for pda or other mobile devices. Have about 6 cds on it and movies and still have a lot of space good deal for the amount of space you get.
5,This 2GB truns my phone into the ulitmate iPod,"...Well even though iPod's have 20GB, 30GB, 60GB, and even 80GB where its not even in the same league as a 2GB memory card, this 2GB miniSD still makes it feel like I now own an iPod.Some reviewers has said that this memory card doesn't work well with the Sprint PPC-6700 (some has said the problems start happening when you formate it), but I haven't had any problems yet so far (haven't even formated it) and I've own my for about a week now. I didn't have to formate when I first got it, I just plug-it in and it was ready to use. With its 2GB size I was able to fit a good 5 TV show episodes onto it.Hopefully I wouldn't have any problems with it if something happens and I do need to formate it. I have Windows XP (I hear thats a reason), hopefully if I do have a problem formating it the Windows Vista I'm getting in a couple of months will fix that up."
5,ULTAMATE BEYBLADE ON EARTH (leader of bladecrushers),MASTER DRANZER is the best endurence and defence beyblade anyone could have. With it i cut driger f's attack ring in two piceses. it lasts for 2min 43sec. i have won like every battle.everybody always wants to battle me.it stays in one spot and always guards its ground and when a beyblade comes to it master dranzer gives it a huge punch.
4,Master Dranzer is breakable,"This beyblade seems to be excellent when you check out the title of master in it, but the one I own has broken in two places because of light and minor hitting compared to other beyblades. If you are seeking a long term beyblade, this beyblade might not meet your expectations and might falter in the long run. Check out others such as Master Draciel, Draciel S, Dranzer S with left spin gear, Driger F and S and Dragoon S and F. Those blades are much more worthy of your hard earned dollar."
4,wind blade,a very big enrence against all dragoon types in a stadium.not a very good attacker.it has no attack whatsoever in the ring and remeber LET IT RIP!!!!!!!!
2,A weak bird,"Why do people say its so good. its horrible.A zinrai blade destroyed it(We all know zinrai isnt good). The attack ring broke in half,the base cracked)the spin gear broke(dont ask me how). and dont say i dont know how to put beyblades together because i do!!!.Its attack and defence stinks and the endurance is okay.if you want to get this blade your crazy. ... Dont think i hate drazer because hes pretty cool.I just dont like master dranzer.I dont see how people say master dranzer broke those beyblades. ..."
2,Dont Get It (see more abaut me),Dont get this blade.The attack ring is totally BOGUS and the bladebase STINKS!The endurance is sorta good and the defence and attack are tottaly LAME.I do not recomend this blade to anybody.
5,Another great purchase,"Very comfortable chairs, very sturdy and not too heavy to move around. Arrived fast and assembled."
1,Poorly package items,"Received two shipments by UPS, both were damaged and had to be returned. Do not accept delivery util you inspect them. They are poorly pack by the factory."
5,yellow house mystery,"in book number three of the boxcar series, the children find themselves yet another mystery. they find a yellow house that they are forbidden to go into because the man who lived there vanished. the boxcar children are on their way to solving the mystery....but when they solve it, can they heal a broken heart?"
5,Great,"Good book good for all ages. Loved the ending more than anything. I didn't remember anything about Mr,. Bill in later stories"
4,"Owned once before, have it again",One of National Lampoon's memorable parodies I had owned once before; I missed owning a copy and now have one again.
3,"Some good parts, doesn't cut it overall","There are some good gags in this book, but you have to wade through it all to get them and they aren't enough of them. Quite funny, quite distracting, quite worth buying.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
2,Another Flawed Reissue!,"Why do the publishers of these National Lampoon reissues even bother if they are not going to do it right? One of the great things about the original National Lampoon is that they knew how to do a PARODY....That means that the object that is the PARODY should appear as if it were the object being parodied! A High School Yearbook Parody should look like a High School Yearbook, and a Parody of a Sunday Newspaper should look like a real Sunday Newspaper, not a book...that is the point...Maybe I'm too hung up on the design, but that's a major aspect of the title and the project...Also, as mentioned in other reviews, this edition has been re-typset with mistakes inherent! If you can find an original edition, trust me, you're better off in the long run paying the extra bucks...for the overall package it's much more worth it than this ugly travesty! 2 stars though, for the content!"
1,Don't waste your time or you money!,"Dr. Mulligan didn't put much effort into writing this book. She relied on surveys and excerts (quotes) from other authors. If anything, the quotes were more interesting than Dr. Mullligan's limited writing in the book. You better off buying the books by the other authors she quoted. Additionally, Dr. Mulligan did not give the complete results to the survey questions."
5,I couldn't put it down!!,"As a man who routinely has homosexual relations with black men, I found this book to be extremely helpful. It taught me ways to please a man that I didn't even know existed! The illistrations were scintillating!"
4,Nice Introduction to Socket Programming,The other reviewers have it right: the book is a nice introduction to socket programming. All of the 'C' socket functions are there. Topics such as signals and multithreading are covered. The book is succinct but not simplistic.Unix is assumed as the OS. Windows programmers will have to get the code from the authors' book site. In some cases there is no equivalent code.But the authors are right. This book merely scratches the surface in terms of programming for the network.
1,"No, no, no. Bad, book, bad.","This book is woefully incomplete. The real world examples aren't, and as for being a practical guide for programmers it isn't. It is missing critical topics such as what is Nagle's algorithm (i.e. TCP_NODELAY) and when to use it. Helpful resolver functions such as sethostent() and endhostent() are not discussed. It includes none of the lessons learned by the apache server project (i.e. ways to handle thundering herd (accept() wakeups)).This is a great book to make a programmer incredibly dangerous at network programming, but isn't complete enough to make them understand why if they change the examples quirky things start to happen.Network socket programming isn't something that can be done with a glass of lemonade and a weekend with this book. Get the Steven's books, and then get Effective TCP/IP Programming which quickly tells you how to polish what you have created to something resembling a predictable ""working"" network application."
3,"It's not about Ritz-Carlton Hotels, this is a novel","When I bought this book, I thought it was a book about Ritz Carlton Hotels. Actually it's a novel about Mr. Ritz and Mrs Carlton. I do not want to give comments if this is wonderful novel, it's just a mistake for me."
2,Less talk - more action needed!,"Looking at issues beyond the basics, and particularly the skills for reading water, were excellent themes to start from. Unfortunately, this DVD lacks structure and focus. The technical shooting is poor (it does feel like amateur video), and there is way too much unstructured talking. Overall, you feel that the cast when shooting one day and whatever happened that day is what you get on this DVD. Also, the ""reading the water"" part is certainly not going beyond the basics. It is the basics and nothing more. Overall disappointing."
4,A Noir Gem,"I was very surprised by this little known film. I purchased this DVD-R because I generally admire the work of its two primary participants, Director, Budd Boetticher and Joseph Cotten. People Generally remember Boetticher's Westerns but,this tough,fast-paced suspense film with great L.A. location photography underlines his talent as a director. The unexpected bonus to this movie is the performance of Wendell Corey. In maybe, the best performance of his career, Wendell Corey is both frightening and pathetic as he seeks his revenge. The last five minutes as Cotten attempts to bring down the assassin, are particularly wrenching. Check this little nugget out."
2,niche design - but some uncomfortabe issues,"This case is looking pretty good. Also, handling and opening with two strips is ok.But if you put in a Lumix LX2, the switch of the flashlight was quiete often turned and open it. Then you have to open the 2 zips for remove the camera- this takes a lot time. Your shot is gone.Another issue is, that the belt fixing is to small. You can use only slim belts. Clear point of minus.My recommendation - use only with Lumix TZ-types and slim lady belts ;-)."
1,Case for LX3,"Hola Gente:No way to put inside this case a Lumix LX3, case is a little short.Saludos, Allan."
2,Case for Panasonic camera model DMC-TZ5,"I purchased this camera case to be used with for the Panasonic Model DMC-TZ25. I hoped that this little case would have an extra compartment for abattery. It did not. The camera fits very well, but that is all it fits.I also did not get the ""bang for the buck"". Pricing is too high for this type of product. I was going to sent it back, but by the time I found out what the shipping charges are, I decided to keep it. The material of the bag is just right for what it was designed. Go to Walmart and look around, you might be able to find something for less that will serve you better."
3,Too Bulky!,"This item is too bulky. It makes the camera seem bigger than it is. You can't place it in any pocket. That said, the camera in itself is wide due to the protruding lens, but I wished this could have been more ergonomic."
2,Definitely wasn't made for LX2,"I don't recommended this case at all. This case was probably made by someone who had no clue. I can't believe Panasonic would put their name this.The case seems to fit right, but you can't close the flap as it doesn't fit. I wish the flap is a little bit longer. So you have to press down and snap to the velcro. Add insults to the injury, the belt loop is unusable. It is just all wrong."
3,It's a camera case,It's a camera case. It's safe and secure. It could do with another compartment for an extra battery and flash card.
1,The truth about Outgrabe,"Our congregation has been watching Outgrabe closely for several years as part of our WorldWatch program. Recently, there has been a big upsurge in Outgrabe activity, and that's why I'm posting this. Don't be fooled by the Outgrabe hubub! They're fans think they are wise iconoclasts, but we know better. They are as foolishness before the Lord! Please, please, for your own safety, visit our site at www.jesushatesoutgrabe.com and learn the truth for yourself."
4,I saw Outgrabe on their USO tour,"St.John is a huge sweaty guy, a strange combination of sweetness-and-light and barely controlled rage. He was banging the hell out of his double-neck Gibson. Calaveras is a sexy hotspot who sounds like she knows everything in the world. It was funny to see them playing at Landstuhl, since they are such lefties, but they managed to keep it in check for the show. (Although they seemed pretty cozy with Al Franken, who was also on the tour.) Their new guitarist was pretty hot, too. I think she used to play with the Roadkill Girls.I remember when their ""Love in the Time of War"" song was playing at WKDT (Westpoint) when I was there in the late 90s. They have some kind of love/hate thing about war, I guess. Anyway, it was a good show."
5,electro 80s new wave stomper,"This overlooked gem has some rocking synths, dance beats and new wave male vocal. My actual favorite is the 'radio mix' because it gets to the point and is the most danceable--the ""original mix"" is a long version of the same, but it's length is due to a lot of filler with breakbeats. Track times:Original Mix (7:24)LR - YE - PR & LS Remix (8:32)Radio Mix (3:23)"
4,Amsterdam Cop Rules,"These short stories set in Holland and Maine give a unique view into the ""Dutch"" perspective toward policing and government in general. Janwillem's deft style and his characters introspective personalities make the reader long to be in the wicked city of Amsterdam."
2,Weird smell,I didn't like the smell. Also it irritated the area under my eyes and I returned it. Good that it is paraben free.
4,"YES, IT IS FABULOUS !","Although there are a number of skin care items with which I'm more than pleased, I can't resist when a friend touts an ""amazing"" product to me. That was the case with MyChelle Fabulous Eye Cream. Of course, after listening to her rave, I couldn't wait to see for myself - and see I did!MyChelle Dermaceuticals, I learned, is a natural skin care company that uses no preservatives whatsoever, and makes products chock full of active ingredients. So, I thought, what difference does that make to me? A lot!It's called Fabulous Eye Cream, and it is. Absorbing quickly it leaves skin around the eye area smooth, supple and ready for make up. With the smoothness comes a diminished appearance of those ""laugh lines."" Who was it who said she'd earned her wrinkles? Give me a healthy paycheck any day!I use it both morning and night after cleansing - one more addition to the number of skin care items with which I'm more than pleased.- Gail Cooke"
4,Great eye cream!,I really enjoy using this eye cream. I usually switch between this one for the summer and the 100 percent pure coffee bean eye cream for the winter. It is light and perfect for summer...
4,Good eye cream,"I am an early 40yrs with dry-dehydrated wrinkle eyes. I gave 4 stars because I have been using this product for only three weeks, and it is not fast absorbing cream.."
3,Good Album Reflects Emergence of Alternative into Mainstream,"This album came in the aftermath of the release of Nevermind, when every two cent garage band was suddenly getting signed by cheeseballs from the big record labels and getting airplay. Taken as a whole, its a fairly good album ,although uneven and with its share of filler. The sound can be best described as generic early 90's ""alternative"", but with beautiful vocals and a very pretty jangly sound, for lack of a better term. The first three songs, Pretty sister, Crazy Town, and Copacetic are fantastic and worth purchasing the CD for."
4,The biography was interesting.,"I did not give this biography 5 stars because I had hoped it would be a little more indepth, however, it was enjoyable and one that I would recommend if you like or are curious about Paris Hilton."
2,Too subjective,"The description to this video was misleading. I thought it would at least touch on abstinence, but it more or less dismissed abstinence as an impossibilty. It was more about how to ""have safe sex"", including anal sex with an infected partner."
3,Not enough Kirby,"The first four stories are illustrated by Jack Kirby. John Buscema and John Romita Sr. who illustrate one story each. The other contributions by Steranko, Kane and others are decent, but not remarkable. The writing is spare and often insultingly weak, but the marketplace was aiming at 12 year olds in those days after all.Kirby's art is the real reason to buy this volume. His characters have incredible power and virtually jump off the page. If you're a Kirby fan check out ""The Jack Kirby Collector"" in tabloid size at your local comic store (there are like 35 issues so far)."
2,Not as pictured,"The item you get is not like the one pictured. Rather than the ends being rounded on top, they're bent to a point. The bottom ends are also not rounded, but rather bent in at 90 degree angles."
4,"Entertaining, Fast Paced and Factual","I have followed the life of MacKenzie and read carefully all of the military records on his life, both public and private. The book is right up there with the best. It is entertaining, fast paced and factual, and I believe, historically correct. I appreciate the honesty regarding the cause of MacKenzie's death. This book is well worth reading and will be an important addition to your historical book shelf."
3,Really great idea for engaged couples.,"This is a really great way to record you memories. I love that it really involves the groom as much as the bride. The only problem with the book is the fact that it is spiral bound. The back of the book, the last few pages, are coming out of it because there is so many pages and not enough room in the binding. This is posing a problem for down the road. If you buy this book know that you may need to have it rebound later down the line. Other than the binding i must say i really love this book."
4,nice engagement gift,I gave this for my future daughter in law as an engagement gift and she seemed to really like it.She is a writer so I'm sure she likes keeping track of all that is going on for her this weddingplanning year. It seems like a baby book only for engagement.
4,Nice engagement journal.,"This journal has so many great sections to fill out and neat little pockets to keep papers, pictures, etc. I was a little disappointed to see that even though this was listed as new, the inside cover and spiral looked a little beat up. Otherwise, this was a great little journal and I was pleased to give it to my brother and his new fiance."
5,Great if you have lots of time,"I bought this a few months before I actually got married and was so excited to write in it. It has all the sections of every single marital event you can think of, even a ""Our 1st year"" section, but seriously, but it if you have the time or if you are willing to write this much. The product itself is great. I have no complaints. It is all divided by the major events that divide your wedding timeline, and the pictures are nice, but I still haven't found the time to write every single detail. It is time consuming. This is a personal point of view, so it doesn't reflect on the item itself. This is why I give this item 5 stars. Great way to keepsake your wedding moments."
3,My 5 year old likes,"I got this to help my son count to 100. He likes that there are so many numbers, but 100 is a lot for him to complete. He often loses interest before the puzzle is over, but we do them as extra homework on the weekends. Numbers are close together which helps for a younger child, but not very challenging when you like to find the next number."
5,Dot to dot,Five year old grandson loved this. It is hard to find just dot to dot books of this caliber. Excellent purchase!
3,Great controller with some significant cons,"Have had this controller for several years and have worked flawless.I have found 2 big issues.Issue one is that you need to be very careful about what drives you choose to use. I have a WD5000AAKS this drive will literally cause the controller to stop, as soon you remove the drive and reboot you are good again.Issue two is the limitations of drive size and array size. If you only have small(less than 1TB) disks and are not planing to have arrays bigger than 2TB then you are good.Otherwise this controller has been very stable and reliable.Other plus is that if you need it is possible to upgrade to a ""bigger"" controller and you should not have to rebuild your array."
3,Shicoff or not Shicoff?,"Shicoff est la star de ce DVD qui recoupe plusieurs concerts assez sympathiques...AuprÃ¨s d'artistes confirmÃ©s (Baltsa et Tomowa-Sintow) il est intÃ©ressant de retrouver Lucia Aliberti, dont le physique et la gestuelle rappellent Ã©trangement Maria Callas, Ã  laquelle elle fut comparÃ©e, Ã  ses dÃ©buts prometteurs. MimÃ©tisme, avez-vous dit? Etrange!"
2,Not quiet at all,"We replaced a builder installed fan that sounded like a motor boat, and bought this fan as it was advertised as the most quiet and less ""sones"" than the others. From what I understand 1 sone should be equivalent to about 40 decibels. Well I measured our decibal level and it is 65-70 which is still pretty loud. It is marginally quieter than our previous fan but we are very disappointed in the sound level. I don't see how they can advertise ""whisper quiet"". We have the fan in the toilet closet with high ceilings."
2,Quiet only when not attached to vent pipe,"We installed this fan in our upstairs bathroom. We tested it when we first got it fixed to the ceiling joists and wired. It was very quiet. So nice. But then we attached the vent pipe and piped it out the side of the house. It is only a six foot run, one 45 degree turn and one 90. Suddenly the fan rattled and groaned as if it were 30 years old. We ended up taking out the internal flap and are trusting the wimpy little external vent flaps to stop back drafts in the winter. That helped the noise. But it is still disappointingly fragile sounding with some rattles and speed variations. Two stars."
4,worked great,was used to replace the original one of the best fans i have used and was shipped and ready just as we needed it
3,There must be better,I wouldn't buy another Broan unit. Baffle instructions are non existent. Very easy to mount upside down which I did. New baffle was additional. Big hassle when there shouldn't have been. With all due credit the fan is reasonably quiet.

You will have to read it to find out!
3,I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS!,"This book is a tease - it calls itself a novel of ""suspense,"" but there is no real suspense, and any suspense that there actually is is left unrequited in the end. You go through the entire book waiting to find out why Tory killed her six co-workers. You never find out, and the ending is the biggest cop-out since ""Son of Rosemary, The Sequel to Rosemary's Baby"". How could the publisher have allowed the author to end this book in that cliched fashion? I felt truly cheated."
3,exciting read.....until the end,"The style of this book reminds me of the movie, Jacob's Ladder. However, at the end of Jacob's Ladder the story comes full circle. The actions in the first part of the movie make sense and become relevent. Unfortunately, the end of this book did the exact opposite. It rendered the entire story useless.I was fascinated as I was reading the book and it was beautifully written, thus the 3 star rating. I'm just dissapointed that I put emotional stock in any of the characters (or their unusual names) as it was pointless.On a side note - one (of the many things) that bugged me as I completed this book and thought back through it's contents, was why does Tory tell her nurse the poigniant story of her 15 year old cat, Gandalf dying of kidney failure and her mother states in the courtroom that Tory only had one cat, Henry?? Again, I guess I was unknowingly putting too much thought into this book which didn't deserve it."
2,"Interesting ""why""-done-it hampered by patches of bad writing","Let me begin with the caveat that I seldom read mystery books. This book illustrates the problems I have with most mysteries. This book is not the usual who-done-it. We know the central character did it. The issue is why. More than 90% of the book consists of dialogues (Hence, the title). Unfortunately, Mr. Spignesi suffers from the problem of many second-rate writers -- he can not write dialogue that rings true. Much of the time the language of the main character (with the ridiculous name, Tory Troy) sounds like something out of a Hardy Boys book, save for the occasional profanity. Also, the book uses a tired gimmick as the resolution. It is, however, an easy, if uneventful, read if you have nothing better to do with your time."
2,Pretty disappointing,"I wish I'd read the previous review before purchasing this - what seemed like a great idea. I bought one for my sister and also for a friend. We all tried it out at my friend's last night - I could hardly wait - and as the other reviewer said, it is disappointing, Even tho it says it has a heater, it doesn't really heat. The jets are really wimpy, the vibrating massage is hard to even feel, and the arch roller is just a do it yourself roll back and forth thing.I'm glad I got it on sale and hope she can use it to soak in once in a while anyway....."
1,Disappointing,"I agree with the other reviews. It was a huge disappointment that it didn't heat the water. It is only supposed to maintain the temperature, but after using it for about 20 minutes, it didn't even do that. The manual rollers hurt my feet and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet back and forth. Back to the store indeed."
2,Holy crap is this thing loud!,"It is pretty hard to relax with a horribly noisy buzzing sound. One would think that is an obvious statement, but apparently the folks at Conair didn't really think about that in creating this bit of ""home relaxation"" equipment. Unfortunately, you also need to place your feet in at a rather odd angle in order to get them to fit under the guard at the top - that is, unless you have little teeny feet. And I mean teeny - mine are size 7s, and they don't fit very comfortably.Still, warm feet are good! So if you're looking for warm feet, this is the spa for you. If you want to relax though, perhaps a good set of headphones would help."
3,Not bad,"Compared to just sticking you feet into a warm basin, this is slightly better. I agree with some of the other reviews about the rollers hurt your feet, so I removed them. Someone else said it was hard to put their feet in because of the guard on the top, that too I removed. It is on the noisy side, nor does it keep the water temperature for to long. But I had another brand prior to this one, and this one to me is better."
1,Blah,"I loved 'Bricks are Heavy', its one of my favorite albums so I decided to get this one and 'hungry for stink'. They both suck unless you're into squealing sloppy punk. Bummer."
3,So much c&*% she....,"....don't need no balls! Little less punk than debut album, little more metal, lotta energy. Wish they would release SH and some of there movie singles."
1,This fails to cover a MAJOR piece of the custody puzzle,"At first glance, this book looks impressive. Several good reviews on the inside front cover. A compilation of other readily available information -- nice to have it all in one place. Worth having, but not to be taken as the book to end all books. Your library is incomplete if you stop with this one. If your budget is tight, and you can only afford one, this is not the book for you.Perhaps one of the most important elements of a successful custody battle is choosing the right attorney. This book does not have a single page dedicated to the topic.Having purchased and read several books in this category, and joined several custody for fathers organizations in search of information that would be helpful to my crusade to provide a better environment for my children.I've also used the author of this book as my own attorney. If you're considering doing the same, e-mail me first for some unique insight."
2,Fast Helpfull Read,Good book for preparing for working with your lawyer to go to court. This book does not take you through to a win but will get you started on the right road. Worth the $24.00
3,Practical information,Very nice feel for a self published book but the scope is limited and definitely from an attorney's point of reference. The opposition in my case must have been using this book exclusively. Good to have on your divorce/child custody book shelf.
4,This book will shake your comfortable notions of the gospel,"This book is at its best when it is challenging a secular worldview and exhorting the reader to be sold out for Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, it doesn't do that enough. It actually gives short shrift to the purported subject of the book, which is how to proclaim the gospel in large public meetings."
1,Jigsaw puzzles,"I found this totally undoable as every time you touch a piece, it gets a shadow behind it making it nearly impossible and there is no place to move the pieces out of the way. I never use it."
1,Not too happy,"I am disappointed in this product. It doesn't have may options, such as only showing the edges of the puzzle and then working the rest or showing the picture in a smaller version. The tips information is not readable. Also there are shodows behind many of the pieces."
5,I miss my pair,I bought a pair a few years ago and I wore them almost every day. They were the most comfortable pair of shoes I owned and I could wear them with anything. Now that they have worn out I would really love to have another pair but I can't find them anywhere. :(
5,damn ... best shoes ever ...,damn .. best shoes ever!!! had been wore all the time specially for work ... the most comfortable feeling as could wear more than 12 hours... i had been wore that shoes till death ...i had been ordering four or five time in the past and now i'm having hard time to fine it again .... get them back ...anyone know where can i order anymore .. im gonna buy ten pairs of shoes as i dont care ... i ll stock it up in my closet....smooshi.suzi
5,My Favorite Tazo,"I'm not really a tea snob, but I drink most of my tea looseleaf, and often blend it with other teas for variety. This is the only tea that I drink absolutely plain. Teabag, hot water, and I'm ready to go. It doesn't need anything, I don't even sweeten it, and the flavor continues to delight me. When I could not find individual boxes, I bought the variety pack that included it, despite disliking two of the other four flavors. I told a friend that I want a case for my birthday; it's what I have in my travel mug three out of five work days.The darjeeling base and the subtle flavorings are what makes this tea fantastic. The used teabags--cooled!--also are great for dabbing on sunburns. The cucumber helps."
5,Just as pictured.,"Works great, price is good, quality is good, looks nice. It works well with my utensils I already have as they're similar in color. The build quality is actually not bad, its pretty sturdy.would recommend."
3,Poor choice for an ambitious do-it-yourselfer,"As a fairly ambitious and experienced do-it-yourselfer, this was not a good investment for me. I'm working on re-building the second floor rooms and other projects, so there are a wide variety of cutting tasks. I had hoped it would be handy and handle perhaps 70%+ of my circular saw tasks rather than my corded Milwaukee--being quieter, lighter, easier to handle. However, the power is pretty low. I used it for a few cuts, the blade dulled, batteries ran out quickly. It soon landed in a tool bucket. When I got it out again a while later, one of the screws that holds the base plate in place (or st like that) had loosened and fallen out. It's back in the tool bucket.A while later, I bit the bullet and bought a set of Makita 18V tools with a 6.5"" circular saw, and I'm loving that saw. It is a more useful compromise of power and capacity vs noise, weight, convenience.For what it is, the price on this light-duty saw seems high."
3,"Handy tool, not designed for heavy use","While this tool is quite handy and convienent, it is definitely not suitable for extended use."
3,"Limited power, battery life, blade life","It is a lightweight trim saw that is easy to use and to adjust. The 1000 RPM no load speed is an extreme exaggeration. With any material thicker than 1/4"" the motor is challenged and the battery quickly loses its charge.The Makita blades I have used are mediocre and dull quickly and generate too much friction on the sides which shortens battery charge life as the motor has to work much harder. Third party batteries provide 50% more power than the Makita NiCad battery pack which helps. Better blades would help even more.Most of the time I reach for my 18v trim saw instead which though heavier does not stall and provide kickback the way the 9v Makita will often do."
5,precise cutter,"Bought this saw for a specific project on fragile stock. Worked exactly as advertised and better than I expected. Light weight and easy to maneuver for precise cuts with enough power for moldings, trim and 1x4s. Especially good for working overhead and in tight spots."
3,Ditch the stock blade.,"Like many others, I originally bought this saw for cutting in close on old work drywall. Battery life sucked with a Low battery after cutting around ONE Patio Door.I replaced the blade with a Carbide tipped one and now this saws cuts faster and many feet longer through a wide variety of materials.The only drawback with this saw is the long battery handle. You can't start close to walls or floors when you need the blade on the right. It would be very nice to have the handle rotate to near perpendicular to the foot for this kind of work.Still, I would give this saw a BUY, especially if you already have other 9.6V Makita items so you don't have many different chargers and batteries that don't fit your other tools."
4,Handy tool,"Bought this as a replacement for one I wore out after many, many years of service. Handy for lots of small jobs, from sheetrock cutouts to shingling sidewalls. Be aware of the kick-back it is pretty strong. All the controls for adjustments are easy to use."
5,"Great saw, versatile","I have owned this little saw for 20+yrs. and it is great. Used with add-on water bottle and diamond blade, I have used it for cutting ceramic floor and wall tiles. The feature I love is its' low rpm...cut wood, drywall, tile, etc. and it doesn't throw a cloud of dust!!! It's low profile let's you tuck in tight places to make a cut. In my opinion, it is for small specialty work, and if you're doing alot of cutting, you should be looking at something bigger. I wouldn't go without this saw in my box."
3,Small tool only for small project,"I got this tool used. My intension is to use it to trim the window frame to fit my new window. but it turns out that it is too weak for this job. The corded circular saw and chisel are the right tool for my task.But I found this tool is very useful to cut off the drywall and 1/2"" wood for window seal and moldings. It's very light to hold! Yes, it is a bit slow but I can get good cutting edge with proper guide.I wish it can be more powerful. Wish to see a lithium version (or corded) with higher RPM. I might get rid of it after I finished my windows."
3,satisfaction is it guaranteed,"i this have used this makita and was satisfied, however it has already became useless because of sticking in gear and not moving the blade. what guarantee is there is my asking. i was very blessed and almost completed the task until that occurred. it is very powerful tool excellantly made, however not know what was remanufactured on it i can only say perhaps this is the faultiness of this equipment's weakness. so if there is any guarantee on this purchase or return policy i would kindly ask you to inform me if not than this is trash now. thank you dawn"
5,Wonderful little saw,"I am a woman who is 4'11"" and in my fifties, I couldn't see myself with a regular circular saw, they were all too heavy and scary. I used this to cut large sheets of 1/4"" plywood into perfectly cut sub-floor pieces for my bathroom all by myself. It worked fantastically. Now I feel like I can make anything and do my own home repairs!"
4,"Handles great, slightly underpowered.","This is a great tool to have around for those last minute cuts, cutouts, and trimming that you don't want to lug around a large or heavy saw that needs to be plugged in. It's amazing how time conscious and lazy I've gotten. The price is great but it's underpowered. The newer version uses the common 14.4v batteries for Makita but the larger (and heavier) batteries give the saw a different feel in the hand and balance. It is also $75 more. A little of this, a little less of that."
3,Broken out of the box. Craftsman better.,"When I received this, I first noticed that the blade guard was very sticky. It certainly would not have safely moved out of the way if I were to push the saw through wood. The handle on the blade guard is made out of thin sheet metal, so when I tried to use the handle to move the guard, the handle bent very easily. I was already discouraged, but I fired it up, and the blade rotated so slowly, I decided to send the whole thing back. Instead I bought a Craftsman #10872. This is a saw that is similar to the Makita, but it runs off AC, and rotates at 2800 RPM. It is very well put together, and includes a case, laser sight, work light, and carbide blade for $110."
3,High tork Low Rpm,"I am a 11 year carpenter and currently installing high end kitchens (60 to 200K). I Purchased the 5090DW mostly for cutting access panels, outlet holes and other misc. cutouts, especially in tight areas. After using the tool for several weeks I'm mostly pleased. I instanty threw out the blade that came with it and spent $15 on a carbide tipped blade which improved performance considerably but...... The saw has good tork, however rpm is way low. plunge cutting has to be done slow or the saw will kick back. Works well in 1/4"" but not so much in 3/4 particle particle board. I would not use it for finish cuts or edges that will be seen, it's chippy even when cutting from the back. A very light duty tool."
1,seller - rumnyap,"Be carefull. I ordered from rumnyap and never received my book, nor did he/she ever respond to my email requesting information. I had to reorder and paid full price just so I could ensure I got it for class."
4,Good value for money spent,I have not used an ionic hair dryer before and ordered this hair dryer nontheless. The dryer is sleek looking with a good range and power. Overall I feel that is good value for the money spent.
3,Quiet but...,"After reading so many reviews, I decided to buy this hair dryer. It sure is very quiet, but it is also very bulky and heavy. The switch for high and low air flow is not easy to use. And thought it has 1875 watts, it didn't really dry my hair quicker than my old 1300 watts. The size of this hair dryer certainly is not suitable for travel."
2,the saw that always stays square,i bought the saw about a year ago and since then i put four bevel gears and one switch i use the saw everyday and i contacted makita they said it would be faster if i fixed it my self i thnk they should have gave me a new saw .i own a lot of tools and this is my worst i would recomend the old style saw i give it five stars
3,Good Cheapie GPS,"Good durable GPS for hiking, boating, and stuff like that. Not so good for the road, frequent battery changes are a pain too. I have never tried connecting the GPS to a laptop, but I feel that it would be good for navigating. Some people don't like the lack of vocal instructions, but I really like not having a backseat driver."
5,"Best gem book, but not much new","This is a great gem book for the amateur rock hound/lapidary. A great reference for the more experienced. Lots of info. on physical characteristics, history, mining, and geographic distribution of stones. The best part is the pictures, every stone is in color in both the raw and processed states.The only disappointment was there was not a whole lot of new material from the 1977 edition. A few new stones and some new age and metaphysical stuff was added. But if you don't own one of the previous editions, I highly recommend."
2,Good old fashioned homophobia,"*House Like a Lotus* is a disappointing novel on many fronts, but most seriously it fails as a novel of ""tolerance."" Her tormented alcoholic lesbian, unable to restrain her sexual impulses, is a straw figure on which other characters can exercise their liberal impulses. Even more disappointing to a reader who loved *A Wrinkle in Time* is the discovery that prickly genius Meg has chosen ""surrendered wifehood"" and diaper changing over physics (of course, despite her mother's example, she couldn't possibly do both) and that Calvin has grown up to be a pompous pater familias who believes in tolerating gays as long as they stay in the closet...."
5,An Outstanding Book,"I read this book for the first time when I was 11 years old, and I enjoyed it then but it was not my favorite of L'Engle's novels. When I read it again in high school, I identified with Poly more than any other character I'd ever read. Ten years later I am still finding new reasons to appreciate it. This story is moving and grows with the reader, so it is appropriate for just about anyone."
5,"Wonderful, deep story!","I has read this book a few years ago and I have been searching for it ever since. I remembered the beautifully woven plot that spans time frames so easily. I finally located it and read it cover to cover. I couldn't put it down. As an adolescent, I can really relate to Polly's mixed emotions and confused view of life. This is a wonderful book which captivates the readers attention and draws them in to the story."
3,"17-year-old Polly learns about herself, life, and love.","Polly O'Keefe (daughter of Calvin and Meg Murray O'Keefe from L'Engle's Time trilogy) reveals the inner thoughts and experiences of her 17-year-old life. Polly has confusing feelings about many of her relationships, such as with the older and brillant Maximiliana Horne, and with male friends Renny and Zachary. The plot complicates when Polly goes to Athens and Cyprus and her consciousness bounces between the present and the past. In the midst of her experiences, Polly learns that she can still love the people who disappoint or hurt her. Althought the story is somewhat slow at times, and is occasionally idealistic, there is a wonderful depth and development of the main character as well as a poignant theme about life and love."
1,Never Satisified,"I was given this blender as a gift a short time back. At first my impression was wow, a nice blender. Then after using it a few times, my attitude towards it grew sour. It has a big motor that only seems to get hot and strip the base gears. I'm looking elsewhere for its replacement."
1,Very Over-rated Phone,I bought this phone for my Mother who is 86 and very hard of hearing... this is probably the worst phone we have ever tried for her... she could not hear my voice ...and she sounded like she was about a million miles way..the sound quality is absolutely terrible. I returned this phone immediately. Believe it or not... she went to the local CVS store and bought one of their phones for about 30 bucks...and it sounds much better than this Clarity one did. I will not consider Clarity products any time soon..very over rated and way too expensive
3,Not entirely happy,"This was a replacement for a prevoius Clarity bought over 6 years ago. The 2400 hz transmission was touted to offer big improvement. Don't notice much. I had to return the new one because the transmission would break up. Tried different channels, to no avail. Replacement is better. Other end transmission is now OK. However, on Clarity receiver end I hear background hiss noise. And the volume level is not set to high. I don't have hearing problem, but my wife does. Bottom line - does offer good features, but it's not what I would have expected at the $130 price. Satisfaction perhaps 75%. Seems to have some quality control problems in manufacture (likely in China)."
2,Poor Clarity,Bought this phone for it's amplification for a hard of hearing person. It is great in that respect but there is significant hiss in the background no matter where it's plugged in in the house. No other phone has this issue so I think it's the phone. My hearing is ok so I find it very annoying and don't use the phone. The tone change button does not appear to make any difference in tone that I can hear.
2,Disappointed,"I am moderately hearing impaired and frequently have difficulty hearing on the telepone. This Clarity phone seemed perfect for me, especially since it was supposed to work well with hearing aid tele-coils. It's okay, but the sound isn't as clear as I'd hoped, particularly the sound ""boost"" button. It's loud enough, just not clear enough. However, everyon'e hearing loss is different, and what doesn't work for me may work well for someone else. It's worth giving it a try. (I kept the phone, because it's my best option at the present time.)"
3,Collection of datasheets,"This book is boring and would not be a good choice for a textbook. It is basically a collection of datasheets for Intel-based PC hardware (e.g., processors, interrupt controllers, keyboard controllers, clock circuitry, bus interfaces, etc.) It also includes a very short section on MS-DOS-based assembly and Visual C++ 2003.Even though it was published in 2005 as a 7th edition, the author didn't bother to put any info on the then current processors such as Pentium-M, which were released two years earlier. Instead, it has numerous pages of useless specifications for 80186/80188/80286 chips. It offers very little over the freely available Intel Software Developer manuals and is certainly not as complete or up-to-date."
1,Toxic!!,"WARNING - do not handle this book. absolutely the most boring, hard to follow textbook ever. It is more of a technical manual than anything else."
1,Not sure what type of person this was designed for.,"I have shoulder and neck problems due to past sports injuries. I had hoped this Neck Massager would provide some relief instead of aspirin or ointments. The problems are numerous; It cannot be fitted to your neck, the configuration is it. It didn't fit well and has no flexibility to be molded to your shape. The amount of heat is miniscule, it barely gets warm. The vibration is loud, irritating and annoying, it provides no massage therapy. Overall this unit was a waste of money."
1,Huh? What am I supposed to be able to cut? Cardboard?,"This is one tool that really is just about useless. Can't cut plywood of any thickness, moldings, or just about anything else that's made of WOOD. Truly a waste of money. It has no torque and its miter adjustments are imprecise at best. I ***think*** this thing could cut paper, but I have better and cheaper tools (like a pair of scissors) for that job.Take my word for it, don't throw your money away on this item. Porter Cable has a corded 4"" that is a LOT better (though it costs more). This is probably the worst tool Makita makes."
3,Nice Tool,"I purchased this tool to cut shallow cuts in drywall (to remove excess drywall for patching). It works great, but the battery is not powerful enough; it loses power quickly and must be recharged."
1,Where is Beethoven?,"If you like your Beethoven played like Mahler or Bruckner, go out and buy this CD. But if you want your Beethoven played like Beethoven, avoid this horrible performance. The tempos here are so slow, the album should be called ""Beethoven on the Freeway at Rush Hour"". And where are the accents? Were they left on the studio floor? Vengerov is a fabulous musician but this recording is a disgrace."
2,Disappointing,"In the appendix on IP addressing, he focuses on the numbers of addresses of various types, and gets most of the numbers wrong. Thomas Maufer, in _IP Fundamentals: What Everyone Needs to Know about Addresssing & Routing,_ does a good job of what Hall was trying to do. (Vint Cerf wrote only a foreword. He should not be listed as an author.)"
4,Great introduction,"This is a great introduction to the core protocols. For me it really stands out because it doesn't contain any programming challenges, workshops or exercises - I like a mix of both kinds of books, but I liked this because it was such a quick read and I'm able to retain most of the information I read.My only critique, along with others is the repeated information - this book really could be cut in half.If you're looking for a book you can get through quickly without manual packet capturing or code, then this is one of the better ones. (It does contain screenshots of packet captures but it's not asking you to do it yourself.)If you already understand the core protocols then you want a book that uses packet capturing to go the next step. (Maybe Kevin Burns)Overall I'd say it's worth the read for any new-comers to networking. If you have any previous experience with core protocols then this book will be a lot of review."
1,TERRIBLE! I've never wanted to send a book back before.,"This addle-headed mishmash was a complete waste of my time. Like a bad auto accident, I couldn't tear myself away- I kept hoping there would be some redeeming value buried in there somewhere. I was ultimately dissapointed as the clearest and most informative sections of the book were lifted wholesale from the relevant RFCs.The book is organized like a train wreck, and its format promotes bulk over useful content. Much text is obviously cut-and-pasted; whole paragraphs- several times. Beginning on ICMP, continuing through IGMP and then covering TCP and UDP!? You've got to be kidding.I wasn't even treated to a very in-depth or technical coverage of TCP and performance issues. It was just a cut and paste from the RFCs.This book is a total disaster. Eric Hall has the chutzpah to plug this waste of time in his .signature; every time I see it, I want to mail him a bill for the time I wasted reading it."
2,easier to just use the shell,I used this for a little while but it was more hassle than it was worth. It worked okay for the part of the egg yolk that was runny but the thick portion close to the yolk would not want to go through. You have to shake the separator and hope you shake it enough for the egg white to pass but not so hard that the yolk breaks and the entire thing just falls through. I used this product for a few weeks and then went back to just rolling the egg yolk/white from one half of the shell to the next to separate the yolk from white as this was faster and easier.
1,What happened?,"I am very disappointed in this CD. It reminds of mid 70's bubble gum pop, and is certainly not up to Vince's usual standards. Vince is one of the most talented singer/songwriters in Nashville, but this is really a terrible CD. Alan Jackson produced what many considered his worst CD ""High Mileage"" during the saddest time of his life, but was able to redeem himself with his last effort. Vince, evidently produces his worst work when he's happiest. While I certainly don't wish him sadness, it might be a good idea to hold off on recording again until some of the sappiness wears off. Yuck."
3,Disappointing,"With his voice and guitar playing, you would think it hard for Vince to miss. Yea, his duet with Amy doesn't quite cut the mustard. But the real downfall of this CD is the song-writing. A couple stinkers, and a couple clinkers, and before you know it you find yourself skipping past half the songs. There are far too many good song writers in Nashville, so many great unrecorded songs that it's a shame that so many of the songs here just plain fall short."
1,"I would not recommend ""tojalida""","Product-VINCE GILL ""Let's Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye"" CD - sold by tojalida. Product was listed as NEW online when purchased. It arrived with cracked cover, no celopane around CD, and some songs skipped the first time played and there on. I e-mailed ""tojalida"" and they're repsonse was that the CD was not cracked upon shipment and it is a recording! Tojalida did suggest that I could return CD,however; it wasn't worth the postage. This certainly is not what I was expecting as NEW!This also was my first ever purchase with AMAZON. Because of this experience I will NEVER recommend tojalida, and I am most reluctant to use AMAZON. I had higher expectations of AMAZON."
2,Lets Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye-Sweet but no classics here,"While its nice to hear Vince so happy, this latest effort should have been tied up in a ribbon and given to Amy. His voice retains its superior quality,and the music is pleasant enough. However halfway through you crave something more substantial than sweet ballads and constant admissions of love. No doubt his talent as a musician saves this Cd. The guitar solo on Look What Loves Revealing is a definite highlight. Anyone who has seen him in concert knows this man can play! True fans wont be disappointed but others will dismiss this Cd like a valentine card received the day after."
2,"A Shot of Insulin, Please","After reading the editorial review and several of the listener comments, I decided to borrow this CD from the library prior to buying it (which is not my usual Vince Gill habit). Thankfully, I saved [my money]. Although Vince's voice and guitar playing are as always beautiful, the song lyrics and style are monotonous, sugar-coated drivel about his new-found love for Amy Grant. I agree completely with Amazon's editorial review. I hope that Vince has now gotten the need to proclaim his new love out of his system and will go to writing better songs and making more interesting CDs."
1,"Skip this one, Die hard Vinnie fans.","Hey, everybody falls in love. One or two songs about it on this album would have been MORE than sufficient...ok, THREE even. But every pathetic song on this album is about AMY. It's like going to the fridge and taking a huge swig of maple syrup straight out of the bottle. Ok, Vince, you're happy....so how about a song from say, a different point of view? 3rd person maybe? Get a grip and snap out of it before you lose your record contract. The road from Nashville is strewn with the carcasses of people who could put out much superior music to this trite compilation. I feel betrayed. I feel like Vince reached into my pocket and yanked out 20 bucks and ran. Leaves a bitter, syrupy taste in my mouth. Now the TWO year wait for possibly a better effort from Mr. Gill."
2,TOO MUSHY&BORING,I Like VINCE GILL He is my Favorite Country Artist but this Disc is very boring for the most part.The Songs DOn't RIng out at Me.I Prefer his Older Albums Better.THis Album Lacks His edge.He is Very Talented but this Album does Him No-Justice.
5,Have an open mind,"Although this CD is not the usual for Vince Gill, keep an open mind and just listen...it is great. The melodies are up to the usual high quality we expect from him as are the guitar interludes. The songs are romantic, happy, positive in nature. What's wrong with that? Don't begrudge him the happiness he has found and expressed through his music or the right to try new things. If you are a true Vince Gill fan this will be proudly added to your collection of Vince Gill CDs"
4,Buy it for the Piano Concerto,"Overall, this is a good solid disc of Abravanel/Utah recordings. The Peer Gynt Suites are well done, musically. However, this recording is not going to compete in the lush string tone department with the likes of Berlin, Philly, or Vienna. Yet, the real gem is the Piano Concerto. Everything worked here. I would dare say I prefer this recording to Rubinstein.There is simply great chemistry here between conductor and pianist: Grant Johannesen. Abravanel proves to be an exceptional accompianist. Mr. Johannesen is exciting from first note to last. The climax of the final movement is particularly thrilling. I believe it is one of the finest ever. The delicacy of the woodwinds is telling in the gentle portions of the middle and final movements. The balance between orchestra and piano is phenomenal with just enough hall ambiance at the end.I enjoy listening to this recording over and over again.Five stars for the concerto and four for Peer Gynt."
4,cordless,"I found this product to be very convenient.You know those times wjhen your on the go,when every little second counts? Well plugging in one of those heavy vaccumes and than pushing all that weight around takes to many of those seconds .Not with this product.You dont even have to plug it in,and weight,yah right!"
5,This is a MUST own reference book.,If you are a Flying Tigers buff you should order NOW. Very complete and LOTS of great pictures. Important prologue to WWII.
5,Thumbs Way Up for Menaji 911 Eye Gel!,I have been using Menaji's 911 Eye Gel product for dark under-eye circles for more than one year and have been very happy with this products results.
1,Its okay,"The volleyball pal is good if you are bumping to yourself, but it still isn't that good. You can't really tell how far you are serving, because it barely reaches half of a short court! And the picture deceives you, because the string in the picture is longer than the actual one. sure, the Velcro strap that keeps the ball in place is good, but what about the belt that came loose after my daughter used it for about an hour and a half? And the string that came back so fast the first time she tried it out, she got a bloody nose? This is only good if you have better reflexes than Kerri Walsh and Misty May-Treanor."
3,Fine,A very good tool for practicing volleyball. The only issue is that a power hitter will get upset when the ball comes out of the holder.
1,Too short,The tether is way too short. When I throw it the height I would serve it gets to the end of the tether and shoots back down. Used it once and never again. Don't waste your money.
5,Great beginner training aid,"This is an excellent training aid for those just learning to the BASIC overhand serve. Unless the player is tall or has long arms, the tether is a good length for making sure the ball does not get tossed too high (toss should be about 1 volleyball above where the player will hit it, not several feet in the air which is a common bad habit most learn). Because the tether isn't overly long, it helps the player increase the velocity of the serving hand which improves distance and speed of the ball."
2,not long enoug,the line between your waist and the ball isn't long enough. makes it difficult to throw the ball up like you would on a serve
5,A compelling page-turner!,"""Lost Stories for All Ages"" is a delightful book, in the grand tradition of C.S. Lewis! Not only do I see something new every time I read it, but in the classic Lewis style, I also see myself on every page!These `lost stories' are truly for readers of all ages, gripping you and pulling you back in time, then, once the stage is set, the curtain lifts to unfold the unique dramas of our biblical past. W.K.S. creates an intriguing and compelling page-turner by dropping clues, foreshadowing events, and weaving a golden thread throughout the entire trilogy.It's a fascinating, thought-provoking, sometimes humorous, sometimes sobering, portrayal of ourselves, all painted against the backdrop of biblical history. ""Lost Stories for All Ages"" is simply a must-read book!"
5,It's about time!,"This excellent book was written for people who, like me, have a difficult time reading the Elizabethan style of the King James Bible. ""Lost Stories for All Ages"" eliminates that awkward style by merging several different biblical stories into one complete story, and adapting it all into modern-day English. Bible translators, please take notice.Normally, I don't find biblical stories interesting, because they tend to ramble and are usually difficult to follow. This book, however, was unlike any religious book I've ever read. I found it absorbing and very easy to understand. I'm already recommending it to all my family and friends."
4,Old Style Makita D-handle Router,"Very reliable. Has the feel of being almost too well made for mere at home projects. Very easy to change bits. Easy to hold with one hand. Smooth, balanced motor feel. Good value and would only replace with the newer Makita VS d-handle model. Would rate superior to my Porter Cable D-handle (that I donated to a volunteer house rehab group) and miles ahead of my old Craftsman that I passed on to my daughter and her cowboy woodworker."
4,"Truly inspirational, stimulating, worthwhile reading for all","I truly agree with one of the other reviewers. This book will last with you long after you have read it. I find the perseverance of Paris to be outstanding. She followed her dream and succeeded with her book although there was the abusive husband and betrayal of her friend; no matter what they did to her (or she them), she was able to find forgiveness in her heart and step out on faith and ask them to forgive her. This book allows you to feel the characters who could possibly be someone in your life today. Thank God for his mercy. It was so real. All we need -- no matter what the situation is in our lives -- is God. This book is a must-read."
3,A Very Different Read for me,"Paris Gibbins and a few of her friends go on tour to promote her book titled ""The Sex Files."" While traveling cross-country the reader is introduced to twisted times amongst friends and many scenic views from around the world.The authors writing style is very descriptive and it captures you, but I could not get pass the title. I am not sure if it is because I am a child of God and I know, no one can seduce God or if it is because I am still lost as to how the title ties into the story. In either case Ms English did a wonderful job of showing how we are all blessed that we are no longer living by the Law, but under God's grace."
2,No installation instructions,"This tool was a bit of a mystery when it arrived. I was not sure how to use it and there were absolutely no installation instructions included with it. Called Comp Cams technical support and never got the same answer twice when I asked how to use it. Went ahead and attempted the seal job on a BBC with teflon seals. Managed to ruin two seals before I finally mastered a method of installing them. Ended up using the butt of the tool to push them on (don't forget to use the installation sleeve), inverted the tool and pushed the seal on. Removed the installation sleeve and finished the job with a 12mm deep socket. The tool works and it is cheap, but I have to believe there is something better out there. By the way, contacted tech support again and complained about no installation instructions and was told they would look into it."
4,It does the job.,Just remember to take off the little springs from your seal before you use this tool. Don't forget to put them back on when you are done!!
2,poor,"Everett is right -- these are poor performances; the Duo is by far the worst of all the six or so available, for instance. The Wind Quintet is better served by Holliger or the Aleck Karis performance. Avoid this."
1,If you love the music of Elliott Carter do not buy this cd!,The consistently poor performances on this recording makes me regret i purchased this disc. In fact these performers owe me approximately 17 bucks. The inaccuracies of rhythm and pitch are consistant throughout the disc. In the Quintet the initial entrance of the winds is sloppy. Gra and Inner Song is sloppy and notes are missed and the performers gimp out on the multiphonics on every work on the recording. Do not buy this! If you love the music of Elliott Carter buy other recordings of these works!
1,not impressed,I found that this saw was difficult to use when trying to cut to a line drawn on the material that you are cutting. It is hard to see where the blade is cutting.If the saw blade was on the left side of the saw it probably would be easier to use.I did not think the saw pulled in the dust very well.
3,A visit from old friends,"I bought this CD as Looney Tunes Christmas was out of stock. While the CD doesn't come up to par with the old WB productions (what does?), it is very enjoyable. Listen closely and it's easy to miss Mel Blanc, but the character's voices are close enough that if your not too picky you can almost believe it's the originals.The CD involves the cast taking a trip to Grandma's house and the adventures they have there, the songs tie into the story so it works well for the kids and for the adults in a playful mood.If you are hoping to relive the past glory of the WB productions, you will be disappointed, however, if you just want to have a nice Christmas visit with some old friends, this should do."
1,Terrible,I have a 16 month old & she loves the Trebellina DVD so I thought I might try this praise CD since she loves music. She's totally not interested in this CD & I can't really blame her. The music is good but the video is terrible. It looks like an acid trip & the old guy smiling in the middle of the first song is weird. I won't be purchasing any more of these DVD's.
5,"Wow, amazing stuff.","I've used other Howard brand products before with good results.So I thought I'd try this one out to see how it would work.I was totally amazed! The results were amazing and wonderful. The table looks like new! It filled in every scratch and sign of use our little table had. The only place it didn't work as well on was the area where the table splits in half.One side of the table has an area that is just slightly higher than the other side. So the raised side has become very worn on the corner and that one corner didn't get 'restored' as well as the rest of the table. That corner is still lighter but it is also still better than it was before I used the product. This stuff is wonderful, I wish I knew about it sooner."
5,This is the GOOD stuff!,"I have been using different stains and restoration products for over 40 years, and this is the absolute best! This Restor-a-finish was so good and easy to use that my wife (who normally leaves wood working up to me) went around the entire house and literally did every piece of oak woodwork and furniture we had. She used up the first can in a week and this purchase is for our second can of the product."
5,Miracle Worker,"I'm off from work doing some home projects. At this moment I'm actually using this product on the partial paneling I have in my kitchen. This stuff works! I started out wiping it on then wiping the excess off as recommended. My paneling is so dry from the heat of the kitchen that it was better for me to wipe on and leave on, which I started to do. Amazing product. I chose not to use steel wool, but I do see why it would be recommended for harder type wood.Terry cloth rags were sufficient for paneling.It actually looks good just wiping it on only, but I want just a little bit more shine, so I purchased the Feed N Wax to apply after the 30 minute waiting period.The Feed N Wax was particular needed with this project, because again I'm dealing with paneling in the kitchen. Heat will tend to dry out any wood, so this was well needed protection. Absolutely, love this product. I would highly recommend to everyone. If you think your wood is beyond help try this product before you give up."
3,restora finish,"It did not do what i needed it to do, and that was to restore a wood/laminate surface. I even tried using steel wool to apply it (like videos showed) and that did not work either. I did however touch up some other wood items I have and they now have a nice sheen to them, but it worked more like old english in my situation."
2,I expected too much,"While for even colored wood it does a good job, don't expect too much. It will add color and luster but will not blend in areas with rubbed off stain with other areas. I did follow the directions and used the recommended steel wool and yes, I have refinished pieces of furniture before. If the piece is worn, refinish the old fashioned way. If you just want to add new life, this product is fine. By the way, I bought mine at Home Depot for the same price. Why you you order this mail order? Just curious."
2,Awful Fumes!,"Restor a finish does a great job making wood look new, however the fumes/smell of this product are absolutely awful! I used it as instructions indicated, on my guest bathroom cabinets, and my entire house smelled of it! We ventilated very well, and had fans on full force! I will not be using on my kitchen cabinets as I had previously planned. I can't even imagine how much worse that would be!!!"
4,Restore Finish,Worked well on hiding scratches on wood floors that had recently been refinished. I would recommend for purchase for small scratches.
5,Brought my antique sideboard back to its former glory,"I have a beautiful, well-made 1870s sideboard that unfortunately came to me in rather rough shape. The finish was dull, there were lots of scratches, and something weird was going on with the walnut burl veneer on the doors. I was extremely nervous to try this product on the sideboard for fear it would stain or look odd. I was wrong - it blended in perfectly and fixed every single blemish my sideboard had. Not only is it beautiful again, it has a glossy sheen that you can almost see your reflection in. I'm really pleased with the results and have since thought of about 10 other things to use Restore-A-Finish on! It's pretty amazing stuff. (Note to fellow antique restorers- I used an oil painting brush to cover heavily carved areas with the Restore-A-Finish and it worked perfectly. The steel wool mentioned in the product instructions was way too scary for me, so I stuck with my brush and rubbed off with a rag. Worked great!)"
5,Great product,"I have a coffee table that has been neglected over the years, and this product made it 'like new' again. Works perfectly with 0000 steel wool. The smell is tolerable and the result is great!"
3,Campy but cool...,"This is your basic, 80's, campy horror movie -- so be warned. If you watch this movie, prepare to face EXTREME campy-ness. Complete with somewhat impressive special effects, entertaining scenes, a little comedy, and bad acting -- ""My Demon Lover"" delivers a top-knotch performance in the field of 80's, horror movie campy-ness! I'd check it out. But serious horror movie-goers beware..."
1,1 Star Because They Won't Allow Zero!,"Please do not rent, purchase, or view this movie. It is an absolute waste of time and money. This is the worst movie ever in the history of movies. I had to see this fiasco in the theater so I feel it is my responsibility to warn everyone else."
2,"Marvel, Mantis, Magic, and Mahem...","Looking back, what was so important about being the Celestial Madonna?One would think that an event of such magnitude would still have reprecussions in the Marvel Universe today. It has not. Mantis' spawn has yet to make a significant contribution nor has the offspring done anything to be a factor in any storyline since. I say this as the Death of Captain Marvel is still brought up, as Adam Warlock has fought Thanos, and as Steve Rogers has since passed this mortal coil.The Celestial Madonna has not made an appearance since the Silver Surfer had some involvement with her in the early 90's.There are only two somewhat significant events that happen within this storyline. 1)The ultimate fate of the Swordsman and 2)the revealed truth about Rama Tut and his repeating fate.Other than that this is filled with the superhero bickering that was the trademark of Marvel in the mid 70's along with a convoluted storyline that didn't seem to go anywhere."
5,What a way to enter the new millennium!,"I discovered Francois Nar's book, X-Ray, two days ago, and I cannot stop thinking about it. There are really no in-between's with this book: you love it or you don't. In photography, I especially love good portraiture, and since, have liked portraits done in black-and-white. In X-Ray, Nars combines all my favorite loves: fashion, make-up, and personality-- in wonderful, vibrant COLOR!! A particular eye can appreciate the sequence of monographs, one by one: the full-face photo of Cindy Crawford au naturel! Every portrait is a surprise...And to think that Nars did the styling, make-up, and picture-taking himself makes this book all the more precious. This book can show us how big and small this world is, our differences and preferences and similarities. How we each have different sides to our personality, some more obvious than others."
4,good find,This trash can is great. The only thing is it doesn't hold smells in as much as I would like. It does hold a ton of garbage. As long as you take it out every day then the smells shouldn't be a problem. Overall a great buy.
5,Most preferred model,"Once I found this waste can I haven't gone back to anything else. Those with pedals to open without hands always seem to break, and I prefer one in which I can discard large items (restaurant take-out boxes) without immediately having to empty the can. True, you may have to lift the top round lid to put in bigger, messier things, but it is quick and easy to do. Hope this exact item is available for a very long time."
4,Flyin' High!,"I haven't seen this show in a long time. But I still remember it. It was one of my favorite shows, until it retired and never went on anymore. Captain Hook is kinda annoying, but other than that, this show is worth the buy!"
2,OUTLAW JUSTICE DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO DOYLE TRENT!!,I have read other books by Doyle Trent and they are better than this one. Outlaw Justice is a loose tale of part of the life of Justin Taylor. The back cover would lead you to believe the book is about Justin searching for Amos Harding who killed Justins parents. True Justin wants Harding dead but there is very little of him chasing Harding. It is about the adventures Jusitn has as he goes futher and futher west. He finally comes to his senses and returns home to his wife. Then Harding finds him. It has a nice ending but is not what I expected.
3,Mastering what universe?,"I was so excited getting this book as i am a keen collector of Masters of the Universe and i was disappointed at the fact the first 2 to 3 chapters are very little to do with He-Man at all. I wasn't interested in the history of toys, i bought the book for the history of the Masters of the Universe. I actually found an interview with the author in Toyfare and that in my opinion was more exciting. bring out a He-man album or even a history of the figures like the Star Wars books."
3,The rise and fall of Roger Sweet,"A well researched and well written account of Mr. Sweet's time at Mattel and involvement in creating He-Man. What the book lacked was a comprehensive look at all things He-Man. The title suggests there would be coverage on all things He-Man, the icon he was, toys, cartoon, movie, etc. Instead we get a memoirs of sorts and Sweet's attempt to convince the reader he created He-Man absolutely at Mattel."
4,Interesting book,"If your into collecting toys, or like toys of the 80's, or a He-Man fan, this book is for you"
4,GREAT BOOK!,I thought this book was a good book and history of He-Man and Mattel. It was a little descriptive with describing people and what they looked and acted like but other than that I think it was great!
4,Insight into a childhood love!,"'Mastering The Universe: He-man And The Rise And Fall Of A Billion-dollar Idea' is a great insight into the world of Mattel and the creation of my favorite toy line. As a child I would spend hours playing with Masters of the Universe toys and watching the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon on TV. Because I love the toy line so much, it disappoints me a little that there seem to be mistakes in the book. One such error is that Mr. Sweet states that Tri-Klops was a heroic toy. Any MOTU fan worth his/her own salt knows that Tri-Klops was an evil warrior. If he was intended to be a heroic toy, then this needed to be explained in the book. These kinds of errors can be chalked up to fading memory. If that is not the case, it is just laziness. Overall, it is a good and interesting read."
3,Mastering The Universe,"As many young adults nowadays I grew up in the world He-man and The Masters of the Universe. I would follow He-man and his friends' heroic adventures through Eternia on television or by making my own adventures with the action figures. I had always known how He-man had come to be as a fictional charater but never as a non-ficional toy and this book does just that. Mastering the Universe is not just the story of how Roger Sweet came to create He-man and he rest of the Masters but how the franchise quickly rose to be one of the most popular children's toy-line in history to it's almost as quick demise in the hands of poor business dealings and office politics in Mattel. This book is not only for the He-man Fans but also to anyone involved in the business world of creativity, imagination and invention. Mastering the Universe is a fun read loaded with great stories from the creator and author himself, Roger Sweet."
1,Not Worth The Price Of Admission,"Boy this wasnt what i expected at all. This guy didnt have his facts striaght and he seemed to have an ego the size of Russia. It was all me, me, me. I did this i did all that. The co-author was his nephew so that made it all the more creditable (note sarcasm). Don't have enough useless stuff to fill a book? Well repeat it 3 or more times and you will have one.Overal Gradde : D"
5,The rise and fall of the 'He-Man and Masters of Universe' toy line is revealed by the creator himself,"If you're an industry outsider who believes the children's toy industry must be a satisfying place to work, take a look at the office politics and conflicts revealed behind the scenes in Mastering The Universe: He-Man And The Rise And Fall Of A Billion-Dollar Idea. The rise and fall of the 'He-Man and Masters of Universe' toy line is revealed by the creator himself, Roger Sweet, who tells how the idea and concept translated to the toy market. Any involved in the toy industry or its marketing, or in inventing new products, will be fascinated by the history and drama of Mastering The Universe."
2,Not worth the money,"I have used this one time and put it away. The bits are so smooth, they don't work to sand or buff nails at all. The motor is ok but not very powerful. It just wasn't worth the money. Also, it took 11 days to ship and another several to arrive."
1,Poorly designed product,"This product had been placed in the closet due to the fact that the first use was a sad experience. After locating it, now the truth of the first experience returns. The motor does not work properly at all. Its spins for few a seconds then stops. If the spinning were to continue, it would not be enough torque to file anything. As I look at other comments on this product, I'm sure Conair should be embarrassed on the quality of this product. It is no surprise that this product is no longer list in Conair's product list. The company should have placed a recall of the Elegant Nail kit."
5,Easy,"I installed this on an automatic gate leading into our ranch, it took about 5 minutes to install and program."
2,Disappointing,"As a beginning TCM student, I was looking for a reference on the order of Worsley's (hard to find) Traditional Chinese Acupuncture. I ordered this ""Atlas"" sight unseen, and was rather disappointed.The plates are a bit small to be as precise as I would like, especially for the feet. The book is arranged according to body area rather than channels (which I find frustrating for learning purposes). Not all of the appropriate points are shown on the expected plates. The written descriptions are in a different section of the book than the plates, so comparing them is unecessarily inconvenient.Also, the nice little prescription section in the back lists points only by their pinyin name. There's no alphabetical cross reference, so they are pretty darn hard to find unless you know them already by pinyin name."
5,13 year old classic,"This router, the lowliest plunge of its time, cheap, 95 bucks at fedco... r.i.p. came with case and wrenches, case long gone, two power cords went by the wayside a makita flaw common in all there corded tools they disintegrate. You may only learn how much you like something by trying something else. I tried a friends recently more power, and bigger handles both problems for what this little router is relegated to, hanging doors. I leave it set up with freud templates and 1/2 bit for routing hinges and strikes in doors. The knob handles set this router apart from the rest up and down a door jamb total control. compact, fits in my finish box, it is perfect. I am glad they still make them. I wish mine had an electric brake, but I will probably leave earth owning this one. I enjoy using this tool."
5,Microstar motherboard,This is a very well engineered and high performing motherboard.Definitely worth the price of admission.
5,"Big Chief is Detroit, incarnate in a band.","This album is soundtrack music to a film that does not exist. To these ends there are songs that leave you kind of wondering ""what the hell?"" as if you actually need some visual for them to make sense. This quip aside, the album rocks hard, as do all of their albums. Mack Ave. is certainly their best effort with highlights being ""One Born Every Minute"" and ""No Free Love On This Street."" Thornetta Davis sings on the latter. The heart and soul of Big Chief, also play on her wonderful solo debut ""Sunday Morning Music."" To give you the flavor of Big Chief imagine Black Sabbath injected with a little George Clinton, Eddie Hazel inspired funk. It is truly a shame that these guys never get the recognition that they deserve. If this endorsement is not enough: Iggy Pop thinks they're really cool. If you like Iggy, Funkadelic, and Black Sabbath, then you'll like Big Chief. No matter who stands at the mike, these guys lay it down and make sure it stays there."
5,Very durable and comfortable,"I own one of these for 3 years now and it is still going strong.Being that it does not cost much money I am surprised that it can withstand the beating it gets from my children,husband and myself.My wrist never hurts when I use this and I even tried another mouse pad with wrist support that I received as a gift only to have to throw that out and continue using my Allsop.So if you are looking for a less expensive mouse pad that will give added comfort and last you years,I advised getting this one."
5,Classics,"Great for Halloween, black and white, good quality, adults and teens in the house loved watching these classic happy with purchase."
2,It's abridged,Watched the Frankenstein video (purchased for just that one movie) and saw that scenes were left out from the original with no explanation-
5,monster movies,my husband has always liked the movie creature from the black lagoon. loves to watch it with our grandson. hard movie to find.
4,nice collection,"good collection...im a horror lover andf these classics are great fun.Might be a tad boring for some, but I find them enjoyable. Price is great, too."
4,Classic Monsters,It took a little time to receive it but they are hard to find movies so it was worth it!
3,No Wolfman ???,"To make this a 5 star set, drop Creature from the black lagoon and replace it with The Wolfman. No Universal monsters collection is complete without it. Let's hope the folks at Universal blow us away with the Blu-ray version of this set. After owning VHS, Laser disc, and 3 other DVD versions of the classic monster series, I will really need to be impressed with the picture quality to buy the set again. Someone else wrote that they heard Universal has gorgeous prints of these movies. Well..........did they just turn up in the basement just in time for this new release on Blu-ray? Time will tell. Same holds true for Abbott and Costello meet Frank. Hope they have a better print with less grain."
1,Totally Stupid,"This is the worst album that I have heard in my life.If you have no taste in music and want a complete waste of money and time, buy this. I heard this at a friend's house and totally hated it. This band have no talent at all. This is even worse then 1 out of ten. at least -9999999999999999999999999! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!"
4,These other guys don't know what they are talking about,"Well, after reading these other reviews, all I can say is the world in 2001 is a place of many varied tastes, as always. I think that 5ive style is very good, well made musician's music that is fun and funky, and cerebral, too, with little bits of production enhancements cleverly lurking behind very easily likeable jam tunes. The rhthym is very funky, but only complimentary to the standout instrument, the guitar. The guitar style is almost bluesy, it is not impossible to imitate, it just holds the song and moves it in a very jangly, funky direction. That's I guess the best way I can describe it. I think they are a great band, at least on the debut, but it depends on what you're in to. If you like R&B like ""five"" or the pop princesses and princes that are popular nowadays, you definitely won't like this."
2,Interesting CD Without Effort,"This particular cd sounded like a good idea but lack of effort by the band made the success of this cd suffer. If they had had a profesional writer the outcome may have been different, but as it is now, not much praise can be spoken of this cd. I did however enjoy a few songs, so it wasn't a total waste of time, but this group has tallent and should show us their best effort and not an attempt."
5,International Phonetic Alphabet,"Product came quickly - within a week.The book looked brand new.I saved a bunch about 50% from buying it in the school store.Thanks,Brad"
3,International Phonetic Alphabet for Singers,"It's intact. It was bent on the edges when I got it, but I can't blame the sender for that."
4,Good product,"I have been using Metamucil for years now. My only complaint? I didn't realize how small this container would be, my mistake and I would order again, only a larger size."
2,neat idea but they don't stick very well,Some of these won't stick to the tub and some get detached easily when the kids are sliding around the tib.
4,great muppet tapes,"My grandson loved the muppet tape,HE IS A 22YR OLD WITH DOWNSYNDROME. He will only watcha few tapes and muppets is his favorite, You were fast with delivery,It was in good shape,and i`m very happy with the order, Thank you, Judy k."
4,It got me here!,"When I first glanced through the book I didn't think it had a lot to offer. Many of the jobs were volunteer and I needed income. There were not tons of choices in that respect, but some nice ones. It is really good for people who have the desire to try something different, money and luxuries notwithstanding. The writing is whimsical and holistic, yet it doesn't romanticize the type of jobs. People who want to find a future of stability and high income should look elsewhere, anyone who wants to walk on the other side for a bit may want to pick it up. I'm currently happily teaching English in Japan thanks to this book."
5,The Back Door Guide a winner!,"Michael Landes does an incredible job of simplifying a very difficult process.This is one-stop shopping for a tremendous amount of useful information. The layout and graphics make it a very easy read and all of the information is very accessible.You can't help but get excited about travel after browsing through this book. If you use it as a tool, you are sure to find many new opportunities that you would never be able to uncover on your own.I highly recommend it."
2,Only Americans need apply,"When I was debating whether to buy this book, I looked for information on which nationalities it was most suitable for, couldn't find anything, so bought it just to see. I was disappointed that this book primarily focuses on American job seekers. It does have some jobs available to ""internationals"" but they are few and far between. I sent it back. Great if you are from/in the US, not worth it if you're not."
2,"Lots of Addresses, Not Enough Info","I got this book to find practicle advice for working overseas. I didn't need to get long lists of addresses for places and people I wasn't interested in. Finding a job or volunteer positions isn't that hard, just hit the job boards and look. What I needed was practicle advice on what to do once you have the position, what are the pitfalls, what are the rewards, what is it like. I didn't need tons of addresses that every person who buys this book is going to send inquiries to for a position that may or may not exist. A hour online would do that quicker, offer more variety, have up to date offers for positions and give more immediate results. Unless you just need the addresses and the limited information it does offer, pass this one by, especially if your interested in being overseas."
3,Good price on batteries; lousy price on shipping,Though the price was the lowest around and I thought to myself the shipping was high $7.95 for a $5.00 item I went ahead with the purchase assuming they must have to package these little batteries with some special packaging therefore the high shipping rate. So I was a little upset when they arrived in a regular envelope via US MAIL with 45 cents worth of postage on it. I think there shipping rates are used to pad there profit a bit. Good batteries just expensive to get them to you.
5,Great price-Works perfect.,Not much you can say about a battery. They seem to be fully charged. They work great and have a great price on them.
4,great,they work and represent a significant savings by buying 5 instead of 1 or 2. also side note I learned that the button on my toyota remote gets stuck and how to unstuck it instead of buying a new 300.00 remote.
1,Make sure you don't have to pay postage due from Media Mart,"I see that I 'm not the only one who had to pay postage due from this vendor. I will buy from another vendor next time.CR2032 Lithium Button Cell 3-volt Batteries, Sold As FIVE Batteries"
3,Misleading label,"The Memstore is one of the sellers advertising Maxell batteries under this post, but what you really get are batteries from some company called Varta with a package written in Cyrillic."
5,Great Value,This is a better value than buying one battery at a time at Rite Aid or CVS. The batteries are 1st rate and they are working as expected.
1,Did not Work!,"I bought these batteries to replace the 3V batteries in my bathroom scale. Even though the batteries have the same specs, they seems to be just as dead as the original batteries."
2,Alright...,"Some of the batteries just don't seem to fully work. The items that i placed them in seemed to have drained them rather quickly, they show to be the proper voltage etc. they just died quickly."
5,"Even with shippping, cheaper than buying 2 at the store","This is a widely used standard size found in most desktop computers (CMOS backup) as well as in some cameras, game watches, calculators, etc, as such, it is good to have a few on hand.NOTE: It is slightly thicker than CR2022 and can sometimes be used in place of them (such as on a motherboard). However, be sure you are ordering the correct battery for tight fitting applications."
3,ok,"I got these for some flameless tealight candles that I have. When I turned them on, they were very bright, but the batteries,don't last very long."
4,Good in the end,"First pack most of the batteries were dead, tested them in multiple Dells and Lenovos--all reported voltage errors. Reported that to the seller, he shipped another set for free and those are all good. Worked out in the end and quite and bit cheaper than anything available locally."
5,Just as advertised and shipped FAST!,Ordered 5 batteries with shipping for less than others wanted for 1 battery. An exact replacement and shipped quickly. Nicely done.
4,"Fast, Easy and Economical","A lot better than Drug store prices for these type of batteries, For less than the price of one at retail I got 5 for my head lamp and magnifier light."
2,"Stale, old stock","I've used these batteries now for a number of different digital devices and every one of these batteries only lasted a couple of months--when new ones I bought at a local store lasted more than a year on average. I can't prove it, but I suspect these batteries were so ""reasonably priced"" because they were known to be old stock. Don't waste your time buying from this seller."
5,Good bang for your buck,"I'm not sure what others are looking for. But considering I payed $2 for these including shipping, if I can get a couple months out of each battery it would be worth it. Have only used 2 of the 5 so far and they are going strong so far. I will update if they die soon."
1,"""New"" (Yet Almost Dead on Arrival) Batteries","These batteries are either the weakest batteries on the planet, the oldest, or they were dead on arrival. They lasted literally minutes where they should have lasted weeks."
1,SF Planet Ripoff,"The batteries aren't the problem. It doesn't matter how many packages you order, SF Planet charges full shipping charges per package. The cheapest and slowest was $2.98 per package and each additional package. That makes the actual price $4.05 per pack. They are cheaper at CVS for that price."
2,batteries,Here we go again....... How in the world can you evaluate a product until you use it. Batteries are something that don't get used right away. Well not with me anyways. SO I think I will have to withhold judgement until a later date.
1,thief's,"pay for my item and never rec it they took my moneystill fighting my money , i ask for my item or money back and i still have not rec anything"
3,ok,"duh its a battery, ok i guess it worked cant believe i am reviewing a battery. a battery is a battery"
4,Cheap Batteries,"Great price for lithium button style batteries. Don't know how long they will last but not my favorite brand which is Energizer. However, these batteries are doing the job."
3,Not in original packaging,"The price is great but can't tell if they are Lithium. My Seller, National Deals, shipped these batteries individually ziploced so I don't know if it is ""original Maxell"" as my other Maxell batteries says in it's packaging. The battery is stamped Hitachi Maxell,Ltd. Japan. It was also short on postage. Can't tell yet how long it will last."
5,Good buy,Purchased these as a combo order with AG13 10-pack. Shipping problem quickly resolved by seller.
4,good product but it took 14 days to arrive,"This is the 2nd order I've placed for this item from the same seller. I remember the first order taking ""a while"" to arrive so I placed the second order before I really needed the batteries. This order was placed on January 8th and arrived January 22nd. Granted, there was no mail service on MLK day but don't expect these to arrive within a week after placing your order. USPS from California to Indiana shouldn't be 14 days. The price is right and it was free shipping so I'll still give 4 stars."
2,Poor packaging...,"The batteries arrived in a plain letter envelope. I was pleased to see the batteries arrived safely, but I was also really concern to see my batteries were shipped without a padded envelope!"
5,still working,it's been a few months since i started using this and the 1st battery is doing great. i'm very satisfied with it.
3,eclipse...,"A short, pleasant, informative book. Numerous typos, poor quality black and white photos."
1,no horse power,i got this because of it's size. so i could take it on trips being a guy i never pack things right so when i get to where ever. i needed to iron most of my stuff.i hate to iron. so anyway. right out of the box i balled up four of my best shirts as a test.it fixed 2-1/2 of the four before i needed to refill it.it gets hot in about three min not bad but it only has two holes for the steam to come out.by the way this is the frist thing i ever got without reading any reviews bet that won't happen again. i give this thing a three out of five but because of it i have not trashed anymore of my shirts thanks to conair
3,So-so steamer,"I'd be happier with this item if it hadn't died at a critical time. I owned this item for maybe 5 years, but probably used it less than 20 times in total. It just completely stopped working on me. If you want something light duty to do the job, you won't be disappointed, but don't expect it to have a long lifespan."
3,Works for me!,I think this product works great! I hate ironing! Its light enough for putting in check-in luggage. You do have to fill it up if you use it on several items of clothing.
3,It's OK but wanted more,"It took some wrinkles out, eventually, but I was disappointed. It's doesn't really work as well as I expected. I think it needs more steam power. I'm returning it and gonna try the more expensive Shark Press and Release even though it's a little heavier than I want for travelling."
2,Not worth it,I thought that this little steamer might actually be handy and remove wrinkles but that's not the case. You will have to refill it quite repeatedly and it does not remove wrinkles as you would expect it to. DON'T BUY IT
3,Worked well when it worked,Review update!: It has been a year since I purchased this and it no longer functions properly. It does warm up but does not steam. Perhaps its nice to have if you're looking for a short term solution for steaming your garments. $22 product that lasted for a year.Here's my previous review:I read all of the negative reviews prior to purchasing this Conair steamer but I decided to give it a try anyway and boy am I glad I did! I first tried it on some rigid jeans I have and I was fascinated with the results! It heats up very fast and its easy to use. I then went and got some dresses and steamed those too. I am very glad I bought this its more convenient than a iron and the results are wonderful.I suggest you try it for yourself rather than basing your purchase decisions on other people's review. It was well worth the $22 investment for me.
2,Less than so-so,"My aunt had a different brand that was $10 more expensive. Hers worked really well, so I bought this one by Conair, expecting them to be comparable. I just returned it. Very disappointed. It took lots of time for minimal results. Not at all comparable to ironing. I tried it on four different fabrics, and none of them looked ironed."
1,Isn't even worth the cheap price...,I bought one of these a while ago and I have to say from the beginning it did a horrible job at steaming any garment. Don't waste your money!
2,Not a very effective wrinkle remover.,"I've owned this for a while and basically, the steamer will get the wrinkles out of your clothes, but that depends on how patient you are in steaming your clothing. I have to go really slow in order to see the wrinkles go away, but it doesn't do a great job of it. Some small wrinkles still remain after and if not, the shirt looks a little chunky and wavy and not exactly smooth.The things that I like about it is that it's really easy to fill the water compartment since you just pull off the small cork and go to the sink to refill the water. However, the water compartment doesn't last that long and you find yourself going back to the sink every 5 minutes.So far I stopped using this because my own iron does a faster and better job at getting the wrinkles away."
5,simple product..does its thing,not fancy...inexpensive...but product does its thing on reducing wrinkles etc...easy to use. I can't imagine need for a fancier more costly product.
1,Not a good product.,"This steamer worked OK for a month, then it stopped working. Back to the store it goes. Don't waste your money."
1,NOT DUAL VOLTAGE,This is not dual voltage as advertised. Its 120v only and you cannot travel with it cause you need a step down converter the size of a house to get it to work in a different country. Liars
5,Great !,"Great service, great product. Very impressed ! I received the book WAY earlier than expected. I would definately order again."
1,Only buy from authorized dealer,"I got this watch from Amazon as a gift from my husband a few months ago. Last month, we found that there was a $300-400 problem with the circuitry. Our watch store told us to have the repair fixed under the warranty. I called Amazon with the gift receipt in hand but I did not have the exact price so they refused to honor the warranty. I don't know how you can have the exact price if you get the watch as a gift. My husband found his original receipt but Amazon refused to honor the warranty when he called with all the required information. He just got the run around on line in India for 20 minutes . It is not worth it. Buy from an authorized dealer."
5,Great Deal!,"Yes, this is a grey market watch, meaning only that Amazon is not an authorized dealer. It's also a great price on the real deal (and the serial number wasn't removed despite some commentary about this in some of the forums), with all brand new Cartier packaging, etc. You can't beat the price; this was less even than several used Tank Francaises I looked at. If you want to pay full price, go ahead, but this is a great deal on the real thing, with an Amazon two year warranty instead of Cartier. That is the ONLY difference. Also fast shipping. I ordered at 6 PM and it was waiting for me in my office the very next morning when I arrived at 9 AM. That's service!"
1,It isn't good quality.,"I bought a Cartier Women's Tank Francaise Stainless Steel Watch #W51008Q3 on Jan.2,2010. This watch didn't work normally: It sometimes stopped , and often didn't run exactly, so I think it isn't worth the expensive price."
1,Needs more research regarding Roman numerals,"What kind of watchmaker designs their watches with IIII for the number 4 instead of IV? And who in their right mind puts the numbers upside down?For $2,500 these are BIG design flaws."
5,Burberry Brit Eau de Parfum,"Love it, love it,love it. I thought that I would never change the fragrance that I have used for the past 20 years, but when I was visiting my daughter in California, we passed by the Burberry counter and I sprayed some on my wrist. After walking around for a few hours, I decided that this is a frgrance I will never change. Thank you Burberry."
5,Probing and Playful,"Spare but haunting poems reflective of Buddhist practice and an alert, probing mind. Some of the poems are subtly disturbing, hinting of dark times in the author's past, but others are hopeful and insightful. Twichell manages to convey a poetic persona that is both probing and playful. Overall, a crisp and bracing read."
1,This is not the real Shenandoah as we know it,"I tried and tried to like this album. The name ""Shenandoah"" brings back so many wonderful memories for me as I watched this band develop, make hits and be number one, but this is not the best from them by far. With a new lead singer who has a good voice I hope people will give him a chance but I think Marty should have stayed with them. It is hard for a new lead singer to come in and take over something that was great. There are a couple of excellent songs on the album about heartache and love which is what I think of when I hear Shenandoah. The Booger song could have been left off though my four kids love it. Shenandoah 2000 has good production but not the stuff we are used to. The show is better in real life. I saw them in Michigan, I was impressed by the live show."
2,Only good for someone who knows about trucks already,"This book only has sample questions with answers for the ASE and hints to help you. It never actually explains how different components and systems work. It's only good if you already know about these types of vehicles, otherwise you can't even answer the questions."
5,It's a Ranbow flag,"It is what it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. It works,Used it on the beach and it worked"
1,I didn't get what I paid for,"I'm extremely disapointed because it seemed from other reviews that the product was good. When I ordered it, I paid for a stainless steel cross pendent, on a chain, with a DIAMOND accent. WHat I got was a stainless steel pendent on a chain with the letters STEL imprinted on the front where the diamond should be. To make matters worse, this was a christmas present for someone who lives quite a distance away from me. now he has to send it back to me so that I can return it. I am so unhappy with this"
5,Great Hooded Sweatshirt!,"This is such a nice hooded sweatshirt; it is so soft and comfy for my baby. It's easy to get on and off, and the zipper works great."
2,Faux book,"I have not read this book so the star rating is not accurate. I did however, watch the Brian Lamb interview of Chris Wallace on C-Span's Booknotes. The book sounds interesting and should have some historical value. However, on several occasions during the interview Wallace could not answer Lamb's inquiries as to the source of one story or another which was detailed in the book. Wallace was forced to admit, more than once, that the content came from his researchers. Wallace was woefully unprepared to hawk his own book."
2,"Chris Wallace Needs A ""Character"" Lesson",I am completely disgusted with Chris Wallace after he publicly humiliated his own father. So what would Chris Wallace even know about 'character' to be able to author a book on the subject?Pass this one up in order to teach Chris Wallace a lesson about character. There are many more presidential history books to be had.
2,Did Wallace even read this book?,"Let alone write it? Or did he just lend his name to some obscure publisher anxious to gain a little traction? My guess is the latter- He's typical of the TV faux journalist now masquerading as a faux historian. The book has some interesting tidbits, but his researchers should be the ones with the names under the title, not Wallace."
2,"""boiler plate"" pop history","The problem with this book is that it dwells on the obvious and does NOT have chapters on 2 very notable examples of presidential courage: 1) Gerald Ford's pardoning of Nixon and 2) Chester Alan Arthur, who did a 180 in passing civil service reform legislation and turned on the spoils system of which he was a product."
1,Pretty Tacky!,You'd think that the author would have the sense not to use her own name when (rave) reviewing her own book.
5,sure faster tha a 31/4......,"I have just used this tool for 15-20 hrs these last 2 wks...it has allowed me to remove massive amounts of wood and ruff shape flat sides also it is a great workout when using for 2-3 hrs straight. saved me massive amounts of time on odd shaped pieces that would not go through a bench planer It also speeds up my large Pahu drum making when shaping the outer surface..Aloha craig Ps. makes the 3 1/4"" planer feel like a toy!!!!!"
5,Great for heating up food,"These work well for my lunches and I've heard are much safer (healthier) than heating food in plastic container. They're dishwasher safe, which makes them easy to clean and use again."
4,Jose Jose - 25th Anniversary,These CD's have the best of Jose Jose. I highly recommend them if you're a fan.
2,SAME ALL STORY,"TO START THE VOICE IS FORCED MORE THAN EVER.IN THE SONG DESAHOGO, HAS ANYBODY HEARD TAMARA SING THAT SONG? THERE IS NO COMPARISON.I USED TO LIKE HER, BUT IF SIMON FROM AMERICAN IDOL HEARS HER NOW SHE WILL BE BOOTED ON FIRST ROUND.IF YOU HEARD HER BEFORE DO'NT BUY THIS ONE.IT IS ALL THE SAME. THE RASPY VOICE IS GETTING TO MANY PEOPLE ALREADY."
3,uneven,"this cd has some nice dark quirky live exotica tracks. but the vocal tracks fall flat. i dont know if its the mix, or the style they chose to emulate but they do not work at all.check out tipsy and prince charmings first cd if you want to hear other takes on modern exotica. squirl nut zippers have a much more solid take on live vintage mutations."
3,LOSE THE SINGER AND YOU'D HAVE A GREAT INSTRUMENTAL COMBO...,"... this was a pretty cool lounge recording to listen to, although I don't think the lead singer's proper and prissy voice really fits in with their twangy retro sound (""Miss Lilly Banquette"" would fit in better with a more pretentious outfit such as De-Phazz... her style is very much like Supreme Beings of Leisure's singer, although not as bitchy-sounding)... but ditch the singer altogether and you'd have something terrific here - this band was meant to be instrumental."
1,"Wrong title, wrong listing","Beware! Tchakovsky, Boellmann Works for Cello & Orchestra shares a stock number with a disc of Russian piano works. They are not the same cd. Amazon has been informed of this problem, but has yet to correct the data. So you have no idea if you're going to be shipped the Vox disc of Brendel playing Mussorgsky and Stravinsky, or the Turnabout disc of Vargas playing the cello works. I would suggest contacting the vendor directly for a full product description before purchasing, just to be sure which title you'll get."
2,Another Techie Book,This book is simply too technical. It goes into that Bible format. Not enough pictures either.The Richard Bazley section is worth reading though
5,Excellent Book!,"I agree with everything that the previous reviewer said. We got this book as a gift, and it is perfect for any adopted child. Various ethnicities, genders, and ages are portrayed, and even a sibling pair. It would also be appropriate for domestic adoptions. My 2.5 year-old daughter likes it a lot. The illustrations are beautiful, and the phrasing is simple and heart-felt. I am getting ready to order a copy for another family we know who is adopting."
1,Not compatible with Sony HDR-HC1,"I ordered two of these Dekcell batteries to use with my Sony HDR-HC1 HDV Camcorder. The Dekcells are advertised as a generic version of Sony NP-QM71D batteries. Neither of the two Dekcell batteries would take a charge, either in the camcorder or by using the separate charger. It's possible that one might be defective, but highly unlikely that both are defective; therefore, I conclude that they are not compatible with the actual Sony NP-QM71D batteries (which work fine in my camcorder)."
5,A Favorite Family Tradition,Reading from this book is one of my family's all time favorite Christmas traditions. The stories are short enough that we can read one together as a family each night before bedtime. I have loaned this book to several friends and they have all loved it.My children all know what it means if we tell them that they are going to get a peach branch in their Christmas stocking.I love the messages of these stories. They always get me in the Christmas spirit!
3,Leo Bascaglia - you can't go wrong.,I have only started the book - as it is a Christmas theme - I want to wait to go further. I have always liked Leo Bascaglia - I use to watch him on TV!The service for delivery of this order was fine.
3,thank you,got to like Leo. I wish there was a inspiring storyteller among us now. It's always nice to revisit and feel again. I would have liked a cd version of the stories.
5,Wonderful story told by a master story teller.,"This book is a wonderful book. I first got this book from a friend who recommended it as a good read. I, being an American Baptist, had no idea that this story was actually a retelling of a great Indian Epic, full of bramin magic, horrible beast, proud Armies, and a great hero.Because of this wonderful book I have learned a great deal about a culture that I would probably not even really take the time to research.As for the actual story. It was an amazing story once you get past all of the Indian words that are used. Once you begin reading it is kind of slow in the first few chapters but once the story gets going you'll be amazed.I can't wait to finish reading this entire series and I look forward to the completion of the 6th and final book.I strongly recommed this book to anyone interested in a good read. Expecially to those who are not Indian as this book will open your eyes to different cultures and send you back begging for more."
1,Ravaging of a beautiful epic,"The Prince of Ayodhya is not a true representation of the original Hindu epic - The Ramayana. Nor is it a beautiful fantasy epic along the lines of Lord of the Rings. Instead, the book is simply a hotch-potch of imaginary subplots and real characters. The imagination of the author seems to know no bounds as he actually tries to pass off 20th century Hindi as ancient Sanskrit and portray the King of Lanka as a Demon-God!!! Had he spent as much time researching the original epic as he had spent in describing the sex life of Dasharatha, the book might have even been readable.Ultimately, this book has been a major letdown. Even from a pure literary viewpoint, when compared to the works of authors such as Tolkien, David Eddings, Raymond Feist and Robert Newcomb, Prince of Ayodhya comes off second-rate."
2,Dramatised Ramayan,I am an Indian and i know Ramayan. I thought my sons who are growing up at USA can get to know this great Indian Epic and so ordered a copy. But this is highly dramatised and also the language used is not appropriate. Ramayan is a Religion for Indians and it is hard for me to digest this kind of a narration and the language used. After reading thru a few chapters i told my sons not to read this book.
5,Imaginative and Fantastic Retelling,"Growing up in India, I have heard stories from the Ramayana from parents, people around me. I read stories inschool history books, comics - amar chitra katha, which is the source of which most indians of my generationlearnt the history/mythology of india.There was also a hugely popular serial on television - which I didnt particularly care about.I pretty much know the whole plot here - so why did I pick up yet another set of Ramayana books - thats probably thepower of the story. I picked it up not expecting too much, but was hooked immediately.Kudos to Ashok Banker, he has made an ancient classic accessible to a new generation of readers. He has combined imaginationand literary devices that make fantasy such a good read, but he also managed to leave the heart and soul intact."
1,Buy the UK editions instead--not this awful American one!,"It's well known by now that because of racial prejudice and cultural bias, the US editors and publishers of this series have deliberately ignored these books even though they control the rights in this country. What else do you expect in a time when the US is invading other nations and suppressing freedom only because their religion and culture is different and non-Christian. Why else do you think the series is such a huge success among Indian and culturally liberal readers in the USA as well as the rest of the world, and still the publishers won't bring out the rest of the books?Support free expression and cultural freedom and buy the UK editions of this book as well as the rest of the series: You can get them at Amazon.co.uk. They have Prince of Ayodhya, Siege of Mithila and Demons of Chitrakut and the fourth and fifth volumes are available for pre-order.An Amazon ReaderProud to be Indian"
5,"Brilliant, educational, engaging, sophisticated, and yet so much fun","Words would never do this book justice, he has surmounted the barrier that many writers face, when they try to get through a difficult idea to the reader. In most cases there is usually a trade off between engaging the reader in an entertaining manner, or providing them with a technical manual. The author here has beautifully managed to draw the reader in from the word ""go"". Every page in this book brims with knowledge and excitement. It's one of the best I've read on the subject, and I recommend this to everyone who would like to have an intuitive and conceptual understanding of our universe, and the way it works. 5 stars almost don't do it justice."
3,Very Interesting...but slow,"Al-Khalili clearly explains and breaks down modern physics into plain and simple English. I have not read a more easy-to-read physics book in my life. Although there is one thing that the reader will find annoying in the book. He frequently deviates from the subject matter and goes off on a completely different path that sometimes has nothing to do with what he was talking about. Half the book isn't about Black holes, Wormholes, and Time Machines either but about other areas of physics. Overall though, a very well-written book worth your reading. (assuming of course that you have NO background in Physics!)"
4,A Step-By-Step Guide to Physics and the Universe,"An amazingly written book about the basics of physics, such as Einsteinian, Newtonian physics. I am no astrophysicist, but love science. The book gave me a clear, example-laden text that I found easy to follow and understand. How Al-Khalili manages to make something such as astrophysics/quantum mechanics into laymans terms is beyond me. The author dumbs this topic down a little to make it pleasing to Generation Nexters with his use of popular culture in explaining something as vast as the universe. Although the book puts us humans in our places compared to the cosmos, it is nonetheless extremely fascinating. It made me look up at the sky at night and wonder."
3,Not a Bad Shooter,"Ninja Assault was actually a very interesting concept, although a bit bizarre. One friend mentioned that he thought it was bizarre for Ninjas to use guns. If you like Ninja games, don't buy this game, go and get Shinobi. If you like shooting games, then get this game. The game is similar in effect to the House of the Dead games. Very similar style, but different plot and story. I purchased the game a year ago and have not played it all that much, but have enjoyed the times that I did play it. It isn't a terribly cerebral game, but then again what shooter is? By definition of a shooter game you just shoot things, you don't really think all that much. I did find the save game option difficult and that was basically, because I didn't read the insert.All in all I gave it a 3 out of 5 because it is a fun shooter game in the same vein as HOTD, and if you like HOTD, like me then you will probably like this game. If you don't like HOTD then don't get this game."
3,Bite me you jackasses!,"You chaged me for a gun and game, yet I got a game. I am talking to a lawyer now. We will be in touch."
3,Nice looking shoes,Great price. Just as attractive in person as on the computer screen. I look forward to wearing them this summer.
4,Well written book,"This book is a well developed book for those who are learning the basics of politics. The book is very simple to understand, and you will be able to learn alot from it."
4,"Can't make comparison, don't own many political books","Book provides generalized information about important components of American government and politics. Within the text it occasionally has small blocks of text that add background information to the topic being discussed, and each chapter ends with a case study that involves the institution discussed in the chapter, tying it to a real-world situation."
5,Best Condition,This product was sent to me in great timing and in an almost brand new condition. I will easily buy another product from this buyer.
4,xmas chip & dip set,I didnt realize this was 2 pieces. Disappointed about thatGuess I didnt read the description well enough. Fast delivery. Thank you
4,Great female pop.,"The first time I heard Velocity Girl, they were a pretty much unknown band playing at an outdoor festival. They still seem to be relatively unknown, but that shouldn't stop you from giving them a spin. Simapatico is their best album in my opinion. These are some of the best female pop vocals that you'll hear. The melodies are catchy, the and the you'll find yourself just randomly blurting out some of the great lyrics. The best song is probably ""I Can't Stop Smiling"" (IMNSHO), but there isn't a track that you'd like to skip as you listen."
1,might want to look elsewhere,"While the concept is decent, it is obvious that the thought processes are the same as some of the better known names in this field.It appears that Mr. Lunn has just recycled the well known concept of ""If at first you don't succeed, try try again.""If you can grasp that concept then you have saved yourself the price of this book."
3,cry wilderness,"this movie was a ok movie, it really is a good, but not a scary movie for kids. we approved the rating."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TEARS,"This is a family film that even kids will find boring, I'm sure. A young boy tells the headmaster at his boarding school that he has met, talked to, and shared Coca Colas with the legendary Bigfoot. This of course ticks off the headmaster who threatens to have the boy expelled. The boy hitchhikes home to his father, who happens to be a park ranger charged to find a mysterious beast that is attacking the wildlife. Next comes a musclebound US Marshal/Big Game Hunter who happens to believe the little boy's tale of Bigfoot. The movie spends is time showing stock footage of some animals, we meet the kindly lady vet, and the ranger's Indian friend, and little else happens except Bigfoot saves the day and the game hunter gets his just desserts. It's all poorly written, edited, acted and directed, so don't waste your tears on the wilderness, save them instead for this movie."
2,Disappointed,"I don't think I'd be as frustrated if I hadn't paid $50+ for a peace of metal and plastic. My main compliant is that even though they claim this is adjustable, you can only adjust and then re-lock the height. As far as I can tell, you cannot lock down the tilt angle. I am at a corner desk and for my set up I my feet are a tad bit high on the the foot rest and so I have to flex my feet and even my core to not push the top down. Therefore, I find myself often not even using this $50 piece of plastic.With that being said. I can see how this would probably work for some people, especially if they have a really deep desk with tons of leg space. I do love the wide, non-skid surface.**Update: December 4, 2012**The foot rest has now cracked right down the middle. Its still usable, but the 4 inch crack makes it feel even more unstable."
2,Was Great for the Year it Lasted,"The bottom assembly of this product is entirely metal, but the top (the part you put your feet on) is plastic. After about a year, the plastic split down the middle from the pressure of having my feet on it all day. I reinforced the thing (with metal struts and screws), but it's rather sad I had to go that far."
3,"Cool book, I wish it was bigger.","This is a neat book with interesting info about many symbols. This is good if you are curious and want to expand your knowledge but this is not a research resource. The book is very small and can be hard to keep open with one hand as it is very thick. Make it bigger and add more visual symbol samples (drawings, pics, etc.) and it would be perfect."
2,Not into the layout,"I thought this was going to be like an old chronicle book that my boss used to own, but it's not. The layout isn't very good. I don't use it as much as I thought I would."
5,DEAD AGAIN ANOTHER BEAUFORD SLOAN FROM AUSTIN,"The ending was surprising. All along I conjured up my own ideas of who Beauford would ultimately find as the killer, but it turned out I was wrong. Of course I'm not going to give it away. You?ll have to read for yourself. I'd recommend the reading. In my mind it's better than his first, Keep it up Austin."
1,does not hold air,mine started to leak in under a year and with very light play. flat balls are no fun.
5,Country's Best Kept Secret,"Wow ! I came across Lisa Angelle while looking for HDCD titles. Found this gem that will warm any music fans heart. Strong and beautiful voice, country themes that are so well recorded (HDCD format)that you're sure to wear it out. Used under $3 ? Go for it, there's not a mediocre track on it."
1,Pretty Good,At times it's tempting to write her off as a dilettantish Shania wannabe. She has a fine voice. At times the song selection is questionable. Overall a good effort.
1,The Secret Power of the Pyramids,MR. Andersen has written 5 wonderful books this last book as far as I can tell that he did about 20 years before he passed away is not worth the time to read. He talks about a 100 year man like that guy is in his 60 years. How many 100 year old do you know...it does not happen. He believes their were secrets from the lost land of atlantis. He does not seem to know this was a fabrication by Plato who made it up and then destroyed it. And even it it was real. It was in ancient times with no magic powers and like all other places in ancient times. No magic or secret information.He tells us about mediums like Holmes was real because he was never caught in trickery. The man was smart enough to only do it in front of believers and quit to marry some rich women.I love Three magic words. It gets you to think. He wrote that in the 1950's He wrote the pyramids in the 1970's and he talks about doing drugs. Maybe by this time he had too many.
4,My husband has been using this for about a,"week. He uses it with the Lexus. I don't know how it would work on a heavier car, but it stays in place well with this size car. He was a little surprised that it only came as one, not two. But it functions fine and that hasn't been an issue. It seems durable, and has a reflector for night time. Good product for its purpose."
4,highland park mat,"Fullfills the purpose well, I had purchased one mat here in Australia, but could not find any more, only reservation I have isthe product has been updated with a stick on reflective strip, which does not appear robust, time will tell, however even ifthe reflective strip peels off, the mat is, or will still be effective, thank you for the oportunity to comment."
5,Park Right Parking Mat,I bought these mats for my husband and they work great! Finally fixed the problem of not getting the car into the garage so the door won't hit it! Highly recommended!
1,You must be able to read and understand Greek,This is a beautiful dictionary but it is not for people who speak and read English and want to learn Greek. There are no English pronunciations for the Greek words...It is simply a Greek Dictionary with the definitions in English...I found the title of this book to be misleading.
2,why not available for kindle ???,this dictionary is by far my favourite but it's too heavy to carry it with me all day hence the 2 stars! why not available for kindle yet??? it will be vey helpful for me if u start selling it as an e-book!!!
5,The Adobes of Twentynine Palms,"Compacted in just 137 pages is a treasury of not only the art of building adobes, but of lifestyles that were chosen and endured by early homesteaders and settlers of the high desert. Each adobe is pictured and described in great detail and many, to this day, still stand. Historical, factual and delightful, one should read this book with a map of Twentynine Palms in hand."
4,Makita 1912B Planer,"The quality is great and it's easy to use, but why don't they supply it with a detachable bag to collect the shavings? If you're using it in a workshop for 5 minutes, you can expect half an hour with the broom afterward sweeping up the shavings which it fires all over the place. It's a great piece of kit otherwise, and a lot of planer for the money."
1,Broke after 1 week,"I thought this mortar and pestle was cute and nice looking when it arrived. I used it for about a week and was happy until the pestle just broke in two. So, I'm not pleased. I have since glued it back together and will continue to use it until my replacement arrives. :("
2,baby alive: v so-so,"I cannot believe I bought Baby Alive after so many years of feeding and changing real babies... The novelty wore off almost immediately, daughter had an excited initial response, but once the task of purging and cleaning the dolly's system fell upon us, it was curtains. She much prefers the American Girl baby / dolls, as do I."
5,Check it Out!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. This book was a genres of fantasy, horror, and mystery. The climax took me by surprise, but I still wonder why Rachael was the only one that sensed darkness around Julia. Instead of Julia getting in trouble, Rachael was the one who got in trouble. I highly recommend this book to everybody."
3,GrEaT bOoK,"If you are lookin for a book to read....Search no more!! The book for you is called Summer of Fear by Lois Duncan.this book takes place in New Mexico. This book is about a girl named Rachel who had everything, friends, and a great family who cared about her. Then her cousin Julia, who she hasnt seen since she was three, parents died and she was coming to live with her family. Rachel thought that this was a great idea because there would be anouther girl in the house and they were both around the same age. When Julia comes she seems strange and unusual. Then Rachel starts to get to know Julia better. Rachelis starting to find matches in her room, which Julia doesnt smoke, and she finds a wax moldin in her bureau. Read the book and find out what happens next!!!"
5,Awesome!!!,Lois Duncan is a wonderful author. She makes you think about every little detailed clue up till the end. I really enjoyed this book.
5,Another great book from Lois Duncan!,"I have read many other Lois Duncan books. I was not planning on reading ""Summer of fear"" until my friend recommended it to me. She said that it was really good, so I took her suggestion and read it. I agree with her. It is a wonderful book about a 15 year-old girl named Rachel who lives in Albuquerque with her parents and her 2 brothers when her aunt and uncle and a buisness associate drive off the side of a cliff in the Ozarks. Her parents go to pick up Rachel's aunt and uncle's daughter Julia. Strange things start happening and Rachel is convinced that Julia is somehow connected to them. The rest of the family thinks she's crazy. Lois Duncan is an amazing writer and this book is surely one of her best books. So buy ""Summer of Fear"" and start reading!"
4,This is an awesome book!,"This book is awesome until the last gripping page. When I checked this book out at the library I was a little nervous because the cover art looked really scary. It turned out to be one of my favorite Lois Duncan titles yet.The book starts out when Rachel's aunt and uncle die and their teenage daughter Julia comes to live with Rachel's family. Julia is incredibly beautiful and Rachel is jealous of her right away. Then she starts trying to steal Rachel's boyfriend and Rachel's brother. Rachel finds really strange things in the room she shares with Julia, things normal teenage girls wouldn't have. Rachel tries to warn her Mother and Father but they just brush it off as jealousy. Then the things go from bad to worse. You just have to read the story to find out!"
4,Summer of Fear by Lois Duncan,"Why is Rachel the only one to sense the evil that surrounds Julia? From the moment Rachel's cousin Julia arrives that summer, she seems to seep into Rachels life like a poison. Everyone else is enchanted by her--including Rachel's boyfriend. But what does Julia really want?"
1,"BAD,BAD,BAD Chinese made junk","I have worn Simcan Comfort socks for about five years and have recommended them to many people but the latest ones that I ordered were made in China. They are not as soft, they constrict my legs, and, of the six pairs that I ordered, two pairs are an inch shorter than the other pairs. I am so upset to lose yet another fine product."
1,"I GIVE UP!!!!! So at least something is up, and it isn't these socks.","Surely at this point there is enough good technology to make a diabetic sock that stays up. I have tried most of the socks on the market. This was my first mid-calf sock that I tried. WORST YET! I didn't even get out of the house before they were down around my ankles and bunching up under my toes. I literally walked right out of them. Being ""clothing"" that I have worn, I cannot return them. So all I can do is warn you not to buy them."
1,Terrible book,"This book was so poorly written and not very believable. It read as a bitter mother that lost custody of her children.(And no, I do not know any of the other people that wrote reviews on this book!) This is my own personal opinion of the book. I just didn't like it. Period.Brenda"
1,Who could believe this???????,"Who in their right mind, could actually read this book and believe that ALL of the judges, lawyers, paralegals, guardian ad-litem, police officers, district attorneys, therapists- ALL of Cobb County could be against ONE person?!!! Come on! You would have to be nuts to actually believe this book is for real. They didn't see things ""her way"" therefore they are wrong & she is right. Give me a break!"
1,"Yeah, right.","Sounds to me like this mother didn't get her way in the courts therefore there is a conspiracy. The judge, attorneys, guardians, etc. all decided to gang up on this one ""innocent"" mother. The book is poorly written, (can you say ""edit""?) and is so obviously one-sided. Don't bother. It's not worth it."
1,Pathalogical liar,"As a person actively involved in psychology, it is most evident to me that this lady is not telling the complete truth. She is dangerous because she very effectively cons those that cannot think independently. Very subversive, very dangerous lady. I believe an adequate psychological profile of this lady would be falsely theatrical, self-absorbed and abnormal lack of remorse. A professional would find this lady mentally ill, a histrionic , paranoid personality"
1,Give Me A Break!,This book seems like a complete farce to me. How could the police and court system of an entire county be so biased against a certain person? If Wendy Titelman was such a great mother why would she lose custody of children in the first place? Why would she move so far away from her children. I certainly would not. There are things that we are not hearing. It sounds like the babble of a crazy woman. Leave these dramatic tales to Lifetime Movie Network.
2,The Truth Be Told,The book tells us things alot of people don't want to hear. That's why it is good reading. We stick our heads in the sand to often in this world. Knowing the truth will make the world better.
1,Obvious Fiction,"The story is very, very one-sided. Since there are always TWO sides to every story, I would love to hear the ""other side"". I honestly can't believe that any normal person would believe this story. ""Yeah, the ENTIRE county is against me!"" Give me a break already!"
4,cobb county resident says sad but true,"Although I feel the book needs a different organizational format and some elimination of items repeated, the story ,from what I know ,is sad, disgusting and true. I believe if any investigative show would truly investigate this situation it would benefit other children and mothers in similiar situations.Unfortunately,money and influence usually wins and its appearing that way to this woman and her children . I admire her courage and love or else she would have quit years ago.If this book doesn't make you want to do something about child abuse and our court system nothing will."
1,Most Disgusting and Disturbing,"DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO SUPPORT CHILD PORN AND ENDANGERMENT. THIS WOMAN SHOULD HAVE LOST HER CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE BORN AND SHAME ON SUNDANCE FOR EVEN SHOWING SUCH A MORTIFIED MOTHER AND HER MOTHER NAKED TOGETHER. IT IS SICK, DIMENTED, TWISTED, AND PAINFUL TO THE EYE. I WANT HER OUT OF THIS COUNTRY AND ALSO SUNDANCE HAS SOME EXPLAINING TO DO. I WAS IN TEARS AND AM STILL IN SHOCK. PLEASE DO WATCH IT ON SUNDANCE IF YOU HAVE THE CHANNEL JUST SO THAT YOU WILL COME WITH ME ON MY PLEA TO PUT HER IN JAIL. THERE IS A SHOT OF HER WITH HER SON AND SOME MALE FRIENDS (YOUNG BOYS) PARADING NAKED ON THE TOP OF A BED AS SHE WAS NAKED SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE BED LAUGHING. TOTALLY SICK!!!!!"
1,Not good,"[...] This watch runs fast 10-20 seconds/day. And the auto winding is not powerful, if I wear it a few hours, it will stop during midnight.[...]"
3,"A worthy effort, but misses the mark","I really wanted to like this book. It has all of the elements of a great mystery, but there is something missing. There is just no spark, no heart. It is as if the author knew ""what to say"" in order to make it a mystery, but lacked a true love for the story or the genre."
4,"Great Game For Vigilante Car Fighting, With Good Storyline","If you like RPGs and Car Games, then i highly recommend that you buy this! This game is an RPG where you play as a 16 year old in search of his missing father, who is a famous car battler. The gameplay is similar to pokemon, but not lame like pokemon, you walk around in towns and drive inbetween collecting items to upgrade your car and garage. You battle with people along the way when they cause you trouble. Your battles are cool too, you drive in a third person view and shoot your opponents with an assortment of weapons. This game is great fun for anyone who wants a good story with fast action fighting. This is my favorite game for the gameboy advance.THIS GAME IS AWESOME, GET IT AND YOU WILL ENJOY IT NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF GAMES YOU LIKE TO PLAY!"
3,"Okay, Not the Best","I bought this book(and the first five) because I have seen the series, which I thought quite entertaining. However, when I read the books, I was dissapointed.I think the publisher's main problem was its' editor. I could find a couple grammer and spelling mistakes in the book(and trust me, I'm not the best at finding this time of thing). Another thing was that they thought the book would be better if they actully put it in book format.I would have enjoyed the book much more if it was in comic style, for the drawings are entertaining.W.i.t.c.h. has its magic though, it draws you in, besides the unorganized writing and the mistakes. It is a breath of air for fantasy, for it is so hard to find original fantasy these days."
2,A Little Hard to Understand,"Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia and Hay Lin, as Guardians of the Veil, must draw on the magic powers they possess to face down foes much bigger (and slimier) than themselves. In the end, they are forced to move forward without one of the team members. This is the third in this series book for middle readers. You would expect the book to go by quickly, but there are times you need to re-read it to get the full grasp of what's being said. The language is choppy, the presentation is so-so (several misspoken cliches), and it is just a little TOO fantastic. However, this book was very interesting. It has lots of mystery and keeps you guessing until the every end."
1,Disappointing,The smartly selected title suggests a much better synthesized essay studying the common points and the differences that exist between the two extremist groups of Islam and Christianity - the Assassins and the Templars.The book is unfortunately a collection of information copied from various sources and pasted in badly organized paragraphs.I personally do not advise this book. It should be better to wait for a greater specialist in the Islamic and Christian hidden religious societies to delve into the intricacies of the Assassins and the Templars and get out with a much better work.
4,A fine overview,"This is a fine overview of the history of the Templars and the Assassins, with a focus on their effect on the development of secret societies in the West. It is well written, if perhaps a little dry, and doesn't engage in the usual occult book sins of rumor-mongering, making up facts, and being generally soft-brained and fuzzy thinking. The author clearly has the occult background to understand the often cryptic and Byzantine connections between the groups and the philosophies that they espouse."
4,A cogent and well researched study,"James Wasserman offers a thorough examination of the interactions between the Knights Templar and the Assassins, and traces the the profound effects that these interactions have had on modern society.Likewise, many myths and falsehoods regarding both these notoriously secretive (and much maligned) groups are challenged, thus providing a clear and balanced picture of them that is both refreshing and rare.This book is highly recommended to anyone of a discerning nature who is bored with the usual sensationalized misrepresentations that so often has plagued these two organizations."
3,Simplisitic Research,"My interest in Wasserman's book stemmed from the background research I did for the first English translation of ALAMUT by Vladimir Bartol -- an Eastern European novel based on the life and legend of Hasan ibn Sabbah, the original ""assassin.""I can't speak on behalf of Wasserman's ""Templars"" research, but if his ""assassins"" research is indicative, I'd suggest that this book offers nothing new in the way of scholarship. A quick look at his ""assassin"" sources reveals that he was exclusive in his use of secondary sources, most of them dating from 1955 and later, including works by Farhad Daftary, Bernard Lewis, and Marshal Hodgson. For the most part, Wasserman stays clear of the myths surrounding the assassins, and in a few cases debunks them, but if you have read any of the writers Wasserman relied on for his research, chances are you won't find much new here."
3,O.K. Tutorial,"This is just a so-so tutorial, the regalia is nice to look at. I was bummed I bought this when I found out our local tribe had it to borrow in their library, but it's interesting if you're too far away from the next PowWow and you need a ""fix"""
5,Learn to Dance,"Being Native American I know the dances, but had a friend who I wanted to take to the powwows and bought this to help them understand and learn the dances better.A cd would have been nice but when I got it only the VHS was offered.Bunch of different dances are shown, each step is slowly taught and it is really easy to learn from.Worked for my friend, we dance now together and have a great time.Ron Soaring Eagle"
2,grip not wide enough,"loved the size and quality was very good, however, the grip was just far too narrow for my hand and the trigger was riding right up against my middle finger and remaining on when i released the trigger with my index finger. just way too uncomfortable and dangerous since i could not really grip the machine in a secure fashion. too bad, i was really looking forward to using it...returned it!"
5,Cuts like butter!,"After enduring years of department-store brand power tools, I started upgrading a couple years ago. This was my second power tool upgrade. What took me so long? Better to put a little more money into a decent tool at the front end. I bought this along with a Bosch table saw for a major flooring project. Love it! I hate to think the results and the endless tirade of expletives had I tackled it with my old equipment."
4,Router bit works as advertised,This bit was somewhat difficult to find. It works exactly as it should. My husband used it on pine. He hasn't tried it on oak yet.
1,hospital blue book,"i,m not even sure if this is the book i,m looking for? your site gives me absolutely no clue what is the book about, a peek at contents or nothing. and if i,m not exactly sure of the title or the auther there,s no way i can find out if this is my book, let alone order it.i also dont know how i,m expected to review it when i,ve never seen / read this book"
2,dirty stylez,had listen to this cd and it isn`t rap! this cd is like metal!if you heard all tracks of this cd you think its all the same songs!
5,Love Tara,"As the other reviewer said, I'm amazed nobody else has reviewed this brilliant album. The songs are all over the map but sludg-y grunge rockers to barely-audiable folky stuff and all with the trademark stoner vocals and lo-fi vibes. When I first began hearing about ET in the early 1990s, they were lumped together with Thrush Hermit, Sloan, Change of Heart, The Inbreds, Rheostatics and all the other great Canadian bands of the era but I always thought they were very much out of step with what was going on in the rest of Canada. Maybe it was because they came together in the relatively isolation of Moncton? Who knows? It's definitely closer to the early Sebadoh stuff but even then, only because it's poorly recorded. Also, I always found their stuff pretty unsettling and kinda scary so maybe it's good to listen to around Halloween. Whatever... buy this album."
4,"Excellent review of history, crime and firearms laws in UK","This book is part of an emerging body of evidence that is showing what happens when society demonizes firearms.Lately, we've now seen the disarmed UK populace subjected to higher and higher incidents of armed violence -- with no recourse of self-defense.Kopel's book, along with more recent updated data shows unequivocally that the problem isn't in the inanimate hardware.The only complaint I have is that the reader needs be familiar with statistical methodology, which I am not. Sometimes the numbers will make your head swim!"
3,Decent Family film,This is a decent family film that had a lot of fluff. Kids will love it adults not so much. I wish i had known the animals in it would be talking because that is a pretty over used theme. So kids will love it because it's kid oriented and parents can stand it.
5,BRICKTOWN,"i THOUGHT THE FILM WAS WELL DONE, THE ACTING BELIEVABLE AND THE STORYLINE VERY INTERESTING. I LOVED THE ENDING...IT CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE. WELL DONE!!!!"
4,BRICKTOWN,"I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE A PREVIEW OF THIS FILM. IT IS WELL WRITTEN AND WELL ACTED, THE CAST IS BELIEVABLE AND THE STORY RIVITING. I WAS TOTALLY SURPRISED BY THE ENDING. FOR FANS WHO ENJOY A CHARACTER DRIVEN FILM THIS IS FOR YOU."
5,"Wonderful,Powerful,Awsome,Emotional,Grand",THis is a grand cd..the way they blend their voices the music..oh...its wonderful..it will stir something in you. If you visit their website they are true to their cd..they describe it and they are very true to their cd..dreamy..empowering..and more..beauty..so much more i cannot describe. This is a very good cd and i sure hope to see more! *if wench reads these* YOU ARE AWSOME! :-D
1,Fair and FAST is not!,"I ordered a book on December 4, 2010 for a Christmas gift. It did not arrive and instead the estimated dates of arrival were extended. I patiently waited until that time came and went. No book. Very disappointing. I will never do business with this seller again. I have asked the seller for a response to my e-mail to him."
5,Very dependable and durable tool,Well made makita tools always does its job.I use this to cut tile and making a notch on glass. The factory blade works great and last fairly well. However do not use the blade to cut glass. It will chip it.Buy Diamond blade without segment wheel if you have planning to cut glass.Overall this saw does what it promise and more.
5,I had to finish it in one sitting.,"Brash Endeavor is an intriqing story of a young lawyer, Stan Turner, who has made some wrong choices. He is faced with his wife's arrest for the murder of a woman Turner almost had an affair with. To complicate matters, Turner is left holding the bag on a land scam. In addition, he's receiving calls from a dead woman asking for help. What else can go wrong for Turner? Read this fascinating story packed with surprises. Overall, a good read."
4,Excellent story; Stan Turner is a likable character.,"This was my first Stan Turner mystery, but it won't be my last. The story unfolded realistically and the suspense built, as it should, with plenty of unexexpected twists. Just as I figured out what would happen next, the author surprised me. The Texas setting made me feel right at home--even though I've never seen an oil well come in. It's also nice to know there are some lawyers who care more about clients than about money. I intend to start with the first book in the series and catch up before the next book is published. Stan Turner, as a naive lawyer at the beginning of his career is believable, likable, and worth looking in on again...and again."
4,Great for the price,"This I find to be very useful ,we also use this in our camper works great for turkey breasts ,This is our second one . Porcelain is the way to go cleans up better than the none stick and dose not peal after time ."
2,disappointed!!,"I've had a larger Nesco for over 30 years and love it! Bought this smaller one, because there are just two of us now. It's tempeture control is erratic and the cookingwell is not easy to clean if anything gets burnt on. I ended up buying a new non-stick cookingwell."
2,picked the wrong name in wish list. Returned product,The name in the wish list was exactly the same as a member of our family. So it was the wrong wish list. Product was returned. Am sure it is fine just wrong person's list.
4,Oddly compelling,"This is an oddly compelling book which demonstrates the huge talent of this author. It tells the story of Anna, a woman now in her fifties whose mother was murdered when Anna was 8 years old.Anna has been trying to suppress all her memories of the night that her mother was killed and the subsequent hanging of the man convicted of her mother's murder, her mother's adulterous lover. Suppressing these memories becomes impossible when the murder becomes the subject of two separate investigations 45 years later and Anna is forced to remember things she would rather not about those times.The plotting is interesting here and the major characters developed at some depth. The conclusion does not come as a huge surprise but the book is nevertheless well worth the effort to get hold of and read."
4,Tons of great 'Dead stuff...for a great price,"So far, I've only watched the Grateful Dead movie and a few minutes of one of the shows; but if you're into the Grateful Dead, this is definitely a big bang for your buck!"
2,Hooray!! Another version of The Grateful Dead Movie!!,"C'mon, Guys! First, the band puts out the regular DVD (with a bonus snipping of several frames of the film). Then they come out with the movie in Blu-ray. Now, we get the ol' DVD version AGAIN! Really???"
3,An American classic!,"Who hasn't ever used this classic set of poker chips at some point in their life? These are the old classic inexpensive standbys that you can find pretty easily for any sort of card playing, be it poker, gin rummy, pinochle or whatever. These don't have the heft of the casino-style clay chips but they do have that classic sound when you throw one or many into the kitty. These are pretty much indispensable and ubiquitous; a great buy and great fun!"
2,Missmatched and shopworn,"I wanted some light inexpensive poker chips to take to the beach, cookouts, camping and such, and I didn't really expect anything more than cheap plastic chips for the price, but I was really dissappointed with what was shipped. I ordered two boxes so I would have one large set with enough chips for several players. When the shipment arrived the two display boxes were ripped and badly shopworn, which really didn't make much difference, however what did matter was that the two sets were missmatched. One had red, white and blue chips, and the other had ivory, maroon and dark blue. They weren't worth the hassle of returning so I just wrote the whole thing off as a bad deal and accepted the fact that like Yogi Berra would say ""I made the wrong mistake"". I ended up giving them to the neighbor kids to play with and ordering a different inexpensive set which ended up being better quality for less money and exactly what I wanted."
2,go to the store,"i feel i got ripped off. it was labled properly but it was have been fast, easier, and cheaper by 50% to go to local stores."
1,Misunderstood,"The female end is not as ""straight"" as expected. Need a normal three-prong ""straight"" connection to the camper."
4,Rock and Rollins.,"This was a fun read. It collects highlights from his previous books, chosen by Rollins himself I assume. He may look like he wants to kill you (which might be true), but you quickly realize he's intelligent, has a great raw writing style, and has lived quite the life. You'll especially enjoy it if you love Black Flag, or just life on the road. You'll also enjoy this if you like blunt delivery, darkness, hotels, solitude, lifting weights, women trouble, alt-rock, perversion, the desire to kill everybody, dark humor, aggression, light humor, kicking skinheads in the skull, travel, the f-word, and the hatred of police, or as Henry calls every one of them...pigs. This is not for the Twilight crowd."
4,Great Stories.,This book gives excellent mental pictures of what goes on in a unique individuals mind. His travelling road tales are the best. Some of the chapters are long to read and some what uninteresting. I like Henry Rollins and his way of thinking is very unique. His prospective on simple things such as a headache are amazing. It sheds new light on some of the miserys of life. Only rated it a 4 out of 5 because not all of the chapter are good to read.
4,Just for fun,"A small book full of anecdotes of disasters, some accidental and some intentional, in opera houses around the world."
1,THE ACTUAL DISASTER IS THE BOOK ITSELF,"Just one example: in page 60 it is stated that Miss Lily Pons sang the role of Santuzza in ""Cavalleria Rusticana"", at the San Francisco Opera in 1938. Well, Miss Pons never sang this part anywhere in the world, including San Francisco and during an earthquake!Doesn't Mr. Vickers know that Santuzza is only sang by dramatic sopranos or mezzos, and never by coloraturas, unlike the Rosina from ""Il Barbiere di Siviglia""?This takes off the credibility of all the other stories. Besides, some of the tales are poorly documented, names are not given limiting them to ""a famous tenor"" or ""a well-known soprano""."
1,not wide enough,"I bought these for my stove to counter and when I ordered them from another site I did not notice it was only 3/4"" wide. Needless, to say, I have a bigger gap than that. They are nice, but if your gap is big, be careful buying them."
5,Great item for wagons and vans,"I first saw mirrors like this in Korea, including one on a minivan I had there. When I returned to the US I put one on my wagon's rear glass, and it stayed put through speed bumps and high winds. Having just upgraded to a minivan, I bought another one. These mirrors are hard to find in the US, but are great if the rear glass is nearly vertical such as on most wagons, vans or SUVs. They are especially useful if you often have to parallel park, hitch up a trailer, or like to back into your parking space."
4,Now you see it,"My Ridgeline with a canopy made it very difficult to see back at the bumper while backing up. This mirror when adjusted properly makes it easy to see your back bumper and large items at the rear bumper are now in view. It still is difficult at night to see objects due to the multiple layers of tinted glass, it still is worth the purchase. Parallel parking now is much easier. While I have only had it mounted for a week, it does what was asked of it."
1,Don't waste your money on this product!,I installed this per the instructions and it fell off and broke 12 hours later!
3,You get what you pay for,"First of all, this mirror is made of glass, so don't drop it. That's what I did because I actually expected it to be made of polished steel, like the $3 mirrors you get in CVS. I installed this on my SUV's rear window. It was okay for a month or two, then it rained and it ended up on my driveway. It would have been better if this had the option of being screwed onto the metal part of the car. It would be a nice device if it stayed on the car."
1,Fell off. Does not stay on,"Works well UNTIL it falls off. And it will.I think if you have any curvature to the window it will fall off. I wish there was a better way to adapt to curve of window (my rear window is only very slightly curved). When you have rigid plastic in one shape and sticking it on another window of a different shape, it simply won't stay on.I think they need to add a THICK foamy sticker layer to compensate for the curves, then this MAY work"
5,Brings Back Some Memories,I hadn't heard this album since I was still a skater punk in 6th grade. It still kicks ***.
3,Could have dug deeper!,"I'll start off by saying that this reissue is long overdue. This is an excellent album and it's been out of print for too long. I already have a copy of the old Japanese remaster from 1999. Being the crazed Whitesnake fan that I am, I just purchased all 3 2006 Japanese remasters with the bonus tracks. The new issues are packaged as a mini LP and have beautiful booklets with liner notes. That being said, one major negative thing I'd like to mention is the bonus tracks are lacking. The Snakebite EP is easy to find, most fans have this album. Isn't there any unreleased stuff in the vaults? I just can't get pass the fact that they could have put some more effort into the bonus material."
5,More hilarious Jackass!,"I have always been a fan of Jackass, and bought the boxed set to have all the funny skits from its seasons on MTV. This DVD set did not disappoint- clear picture, easy to follow menu. The only downside was the bleeping out of any curses and blurring of questionable body parts, but that is how it was on TV. The movie didn't hide anything. lol."
4,Finally a complete box set,"This is a good Box Set,but there are good skits missing,I mean classics.Here are some good parts missingweapon testingHuman BBQOmpa LompaSatan vs.Godpoo poo platterWhy is everything censored,Where Are They Now and Commentary are bleeped,they miss a few bleeps every once and a while. This is what really made me mad when they changed music to fat f###.What's the point of showing the whole first season with Johnny in a cast when they don't even show the river jump,and they changed the title Slip and Slide to Slide and Slip."
5,OMG!!!!! SOOOO COOOOOOL,"OMG! ok so i read the reviews before buying this box set, and i saw people complaining about the bleeped words and some skits missing, but i mean you are going to have to be VERY VERY PICKY for this to be so important, i saw people giving this box set 2 stars just for that, that is just stupid....IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY! and the extra material is so awesome!!!!!"
3,Mixed bag,"I agree about the censorship, that was dumb. The dvds are almost two hours and lumped togeter, which si annoying. The skits range from really, really funny to eh, seen that a dozen times already. I was impressed by where are they now feature. I thought it would be a 4 minute little document but it was almost an hour Id buy this set used, not new. Its no worth the price."
3,"Ok, but...","First of I'd like to say that I love the show. And if this were the complete Jackass I would give it a 5 Star rating. But I bought this yesterday and after viewing it all I can say without a doubt that a big part of what made the series great is missing from this box set. Sure it has a 48 page booklet with insight from mysterious guy who never really identifies himself, but rather narrarates the lifespan of Jackass, and sure there is the Bonus disc with the Brad Pitt skits ""Abduction"" and ""Night Monkey 2"". But there is still so much missing that I and most of the true fans of the series will want to see.Such as the ""Keep God out of California"" skitHow about you release all the seasons one by one the way any other show would have had it done, Paramount?Oh yeah Greed.If you must have it now, its a decent collection.But I wish I had waited..."
3,Bam kickng Phills A$$,"Before I buy this I just want to know of this dvd collection has the full version or if it even has it since they have left out alot of stuff is if they have the full version of Bam kicking Phill's a$$.I've only seen the full version once and now MTV just shows a shorten version of it. And hey if this is the box set, why not include the movie. I think it should of been in it. Anyway please somebody give me an answer. It's is one of the most hilarious things I've seen so please let me know."
1,Minority report,"Um, okay, everyone's entitled to an opinion, but -- 5 stars? This book? Did I somehow buy the author's first rough draft, while everyone else purchased the polished final? Certainly, fiction takes liberties -- but I shouldn't need to re-build the Golden Gate Bridge in order to be able to suspend disbelief. The characters were either so two-dimensional I couldn't sink my teeth into them, or so annoying they set my teeth on edge. Three words: Unconvincing. Unbelievable. And unappealing."
2,stretches credibility too far,"The protagonist has had a lung removed due to cancer (5 year survival rate less than 50%), yet has no worries about a recurrence, and no problem at all, physically, with sneaking out of the hospital after hours of unconciousness that included surgery for a stab wound to the remaining lung and then running all over the place, riding a bicycle up and down hills, and in between all that continues to smoke cigars. Yeah, right. This would have been a good book if I could have believed in the main character for more than three pages at a time!"
4,New Electronica,"Dominic Glynn, the man behind Fluid has had a broad and fascinating musical career that has included arranging the theme music for TV's 'Dr Who' in the mid-eighties, and the commencement of 'No Bones records' - on which, quite rightly, 'Digital Phunk' is released. Glynn takes curious elements from jazz, funk, ambience and moulds them together, along with his obvious fascination with electronic music. What results is a truly original and invigorating hybrid of styles. At a time when mediocrity seems to rule the charts, there are occasional musical releases that merit interest, but you have to look for them. 'Digital Phunk' is one of them. The best track may well be 'Crashed', a heavy, percussion lead piece. The ambience of 'Thoughtography' is also compelling, as is 'Melting Moon'. With such a variety of styles, this collection could sound inconsistent and sparse. As it is, the whole album flows majestically with a hard-edged, alien style. Highly recommended."
2,It's okay,"Of course it's not like Hidden Valley regular ranch but you can use it as a dip for veggies. I tried using it as a spread on a ham wrap and it was too much for one wrap. Too salty for me but then I use Mrs Dash a lot so I guess I'm kind of sensitive with salt. It's nice though that it doesn't need to be refrigerated so you can take it with you. I thought the taste was okay and the texture thin, not watery, but just thin.Take care all"
3,"OK, not great but not bad","In general these Walden Farms Dressings taste great and make a diet less monotonous. My husband likes them too, and he always prefers the high calorie version of anything.But the Ranch is very bland. It's not bad tasting, just not great. Possibly you could add a little garlic or onion powder to make a dip."
2,This book needs an editor.,"This book could have used a serious trimming by an editor. The author will state a fact, then proceed to repeat it two or three times with slightly changed phrasing. I often felt as if I was reading the rough draft of someone's Masters thesis and not a published book.Contentwise it covers a lot of ground. But due to the repetitous style in which it's written, I recommend seeking another book if you're buying this for pleasure."
5,One of the best!,"I was hesitant to give La Mano 5 stars, because ""On The Couch"" just doesn't fit, but the rest of this ""albun"" (you'll understand what an ""albun"" is 5 seconds in lol) is so unbelievably GREAT that I couldn't give it anything less. Considering that this was released in 1994, and I'm slobbering over it 10 years later (after just discovering it), this is definitely one to check out...especially if you're a fan of Garage Punk, Cow Punk, Psychobilly, or just plain ol' kick-ass-in-your-face-ROCK! As Lemmy said, ""If you don't like the Supersuckers, you don't like Rock and Roll"". Buy this!!"
4,Iran the next Iraq?,Thought this film very up to date. It gave excellent background into the current situation in the US/Iran conundrum. I used it in my classroom in my Modern World History class.
4,One Man Band,"The Giraffes, one of the new projects by Chris Ballew of The Presidents, is a pure joy. Writing,producing and performing all the tracks on his home equipment, you feel like you're in the room with your most creative funny friend. There are many bouncy instrumental tracks between his usual crafty lyrics and puns. This is the future of Seattle music."
5,An introduction that does a great job,"This book is part introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls, and part overview of the texts and the work done by scholars since their discovery. It is not a detailed academic work, but it doesn't set out to be. It is intended for the intelligent reader to gain a good insight into the scrolls, their history, the significance of the texts, and the work that is being done. In this respect, it achieves its objective.I like this book because it is possible to pick it up without any great knowledge of paleography or patristics, yet still be able to make sense of it, and gain some perspective at the same time.If you are interested in finding out about these fascinating texts, and if you want an intelligent yet readable work, this is the book for you."
3,For beginners only,"This is a very thorough presentation of the whole range of material relating to the Scrolls. But the only new information is the explanation of scientific processes used in scroll anaylses.For a scholar, student, or reader who has already spent time with this subject, this book adds nothing except that scientific material."
4,A very good intro to the DSS,"There are introductions... and introductions to the Dead Sea Scrolls. Most of them serve strange hypotheses. Because they hope to sell well, they are often creations espousing the authors' pet theories. Otherwise, they are academic and soporific. The discussion of Qumran archaeology, the biblical and sectarian texts themselves and their relationship to the canon and Jesus is fair, comprehensive for the layman, clear and level-headed. Flint and Vanderam's intro steers deftly between the Scylla of sensationalism and the Charybdis of dullness. It is well-organized, very readable, and...not expensive (as Scrolls literature, especially, academic ones, go).Any beginning self-learner of the Scrolls and its secondary literature will benefit from this well-written book."
3,easy to read and up-to-date,"Jave, NT, Linux... This is the only OS text book I can find which has these buzz words. Like anything else in life, Being up-to-date could be good or bad.So is easy-to-read. Any tiny lack of details could be misleading, that's the impression I got while reading this book, I keep asking why, how, such kind of questions. It seems to be the general drawback of OS textbook, so ambicious that try to cover all the aspect, too ambicious to cover all the aspect.Anyway, it's a good and expensive book. Easier than Tanenbaum's classics, and up-to-date. Could be a good choice for your first OS book."
2,Exercises,"The book gives exercises at the end of each chapter, but does not give the answers to check by. Some of the Exercise questions are so difficult to find answers to."
1,Overpriced,"The color faded within a week of me buying it...within a month, I had worn a hole through the sole of the shoe. I had to throw them out. I wouldnt have minded if they were cheap flats from Target, but given that these were $80.00 I was a little annoyed. Save your money and look elsewhere."
4,Super Cute,"I received these for Christmas after asking for them! I am a true 7, when I tried them on I thought I would need to exchange for 6.5, but after wearing around the house- the 7's are perfect. They do flops on and off easy, but they do not flap on and off while walking. My toes are not too tight in the point. I really like them and the turquoise is lovely!I love the pop of color!"
4,Love these shoes,I get a lot of complements about these shoes. They are very comfortable as well. If you are looking for a nice flat that is comfortable I would definitely recommend these.
4,Archeo astronomy,the Book presents exactly what it is: an encyclopedia. It presents different points of view for each topic and is well organized. A good reference book to keep when reading other similar material and one needs a cross check.
1,"If you like crude ""redneck"" type humor, I guess you might like this...","This is one of the crudest cd's I've ever heard.There are other CD's on par with this, but if you don't care about content, you'll be just as happy with this.Definately not for kids (or prudes, like me)."
5,Scary,"Let's just say this game is basically Terrifying! The sounds of the hybrids creeping up to you from behind and the 3D sounds are incredible. I actually had to quit playing this game for awhile because it was that scary. The game is a bit choppy at times but other than that, the graphics are fine but gameplay beyond intense. Play this at night and you will make sure the doors are locked. If you've ever seen Event Horizon, think of it as that but only you on the ship, no one else. A word of caution: when playing this game, listen to EVERYTHING and WATCH YOUR BACK. REALLY! And if you cherish a good night's sleep, play it with someone in the room or if you want to bring Halloween a little early in the house, play it alone with headphones on and in the dark and you'll know virtual fear in a whole new light."
3,"Good single player, BUGGY multi-player","Good plot line that rivals Half-Life's single player story line for fun and immersion. Tremendously engrossing with enough twists to keep you deeply involved for hours. The fun stops there however. My three friends and I had nothing but problems getting the multi-player to cooperate. We eventually gave up. The auto-save games become corrupt for no apparent reason and there were certain areas of the map that would crash our game when we got to them. It took 2 hours just to find the right tweaks that would get our SSII games to talk to each other properly. A top-notch single player game, but second rate when it comes to multi-player. (version played was retail ver. with latest patch as of 5/20/2000)"
2,"Scary, cool, but not a whole lot of fun.","Other reviews relate this game to a really scary horror movie. I agree. This game scared the living weasel out of me more than any movie could.But when I go out to buy a game, I'm not really looking for something that's gonna scare me. I want a game that's fun. And SS2 just didn't cut it.Awkward play control (especially when fighting), lousy attempt at techno music, bad graphics. It's not enough RPG to be an RPG, and at the same time, not enough of an FPS to be an FPS.Bottom Line: You wanna be scared witless? Read a good book or watch a horror movie. Wanna have a lot of fun? Buy Unreal."
5,FYI,"Amazon doesn't give a lot of information on this book. To clarify, the listing you're looking at right now is for the first volume only, 10th edition.Volume I: ISBN 0070496080Volume II: ISBN 0070496099Set of both: ISBN 0070793093The second volume's ISBN doesn't show up on Amazon, but the two-volume set does.Hope this helps."
2,TINY!,"I personally do not like large pieces, but my goodness, this pendant is small!! To make matters worse, the accompanying chain looks tacky and cheap. Oh and by the way the stone I got was blue, I am not versed on azurite, but I had hoped for a green stone."
3,never recieved item,We have used these blades for ever there a good product but i cant give a review cause this seller never shipped them to me had to file claim for refund but these blades are good blades for anyone who is interested ......Hav e to find somewhere else to get them now.......
5,Great customer service,"Had a slight issue with thte order, contacted the seller who corrected the issue immediately and without question. Will definitely use them again."
1,Don't waste your money,"Believe the other reviewers who said these blades don't stay sharp. My husband makes his razor blades last as long as possible, usually getting 3-4 weeks use out of one blade. These lasted two days. Even though they seem like a good buy, that short amount of use makes them very expensive."
4,Great price for excellent product!,The replacement cartridges were every bit as good as store-purchased items; but at half the price! I only wish shipping and handling wasn't so much - or maybe I could pick them up somewhere.Thanks!
1,Caution: blunt blades,These blades were blunt out of the box and the lubricant strip had no lubricant. They went right back to Amazon for a full refund.
3,Green will cost you.,"Just for the record, these are just green Mach3 blades (thus the M3 name for the razor I guess), though they claim the strip has some aloe vera on it. Really now!I don't think the pretty color is worth the couple of bucks extra they charge."
3,Gillette Continues to Degrade Blade Quality to Drive Customers to Newer Products,"The price is about as good as you can find for these blades. This size package offers the lowest cost per blade. However, whenever Gilette brings out newer (and ever higher-priced)products, suddenly, the sharpness of the older blades seems to go downhill. This is obviously designed to drive consumers toward the newer shaving systems. Being an older guy, I've seen this happen time and again. Suddenly, the blades you have been using for years are duller and don't hold their edge as well. You move up to the newer shaving system to get back to the old comfort level, at a higher price. Then, the cycle eventually repeats itself. I am sticking with the M3Power blades as long as they are available, because the newer system is still more expensive and doesn't give me any better a shave. I am just hoping that the sharpness and longevity of these blades doesn't go down any farther."
1,I would never buy blades without seeing them first - been burned too many time on Amazon and ebay - too many fakes!,Buy at your own risk. Too many fakes ones out there. Even Amazon.com sold me fakes ones - I couldn't return them because I went through my stock of good blades and when I opened the fakes blades it was past the return date.
1,Defective blades,Blades are defective out of the box and had to be returned. They emit a noise much stronger then usual when mounted on the handle. I had to return them to Amazon for a refund. I notice that the languages on the package are European (unlike English only on packages purchased at CVS for example). Perhaps there is a slight incompatibility between a European version and a US based version that makes these blades less then a perfect fit and hence destroys their smooth operation.
1,Over priced and over rated by the company.,Tried it and it does not justify to get a blade refil for more then $3.00 each. Cost price to produce is in cents so this company is gorging his loyal customers. Sham on them. Just my opinion.
3,I'm going to try buying these one more time!,"I bought these razors in 2009 and they were absolutely horrible. I bought them through Amazon marketplace and they were obvious counterfeits. Now that I see a couple of great reviews in 2010 and they are being sold directly from Amazon, I'm going to take a chance. The price blows away anything I have seen in the stores."
5,Outstanding Price,Product is a well known item that most men use. This product was outstanding for the the price. Price couldn't have been beaten anywhere.
2,What a disappointment these blades are!-M--3 Power,"I would never order these again. For a long time I would get replacement blades through my Costco. Then they stopped carrying them. Perhaps this is the reason why. The blades are not the same quality they used to be. These give me a terrible shave, and irritate my skin. I spent $40.00 on a new style Gillette razor and couldn't use it. (My current razor vibrates, giving me a close shave, or at least it used to) Costco, with their terrific customer relations, had no problem taking the razor back. So, I am stuck until a better model comes...with irritated skin, and a layer of stubble."
1,The blades are blunt. Seem counterfeit.,The blades are blunt and hurt when I use them. I have been used M3 Power blades for more than a couple of years now and these do not seem genuine.
1,Garbage,"Like everyone else is saying, these blades are fake. If you look closely at the razor, the blades aren't on straight and the edges are dull. Needless to say, trying to shave with them is like using a cheese grater on your face."
1,There is degradation in quality now they're being phased out.,"My husband had heard that this was happening, but hoped it wasn't true. Although we haven't tried all the blades we purchased, of the first group of five, the first two lasted for only 2-3 shaves before showing significant signs of wear. This is very disappointing, not to mention a shame it might be a waste of money to have purchased these, but we both liked the MP3 best and hoped it would be kept. I will update my review if it turns out that it was perhaps a bad batch."
1,Defective Tracks 2 and 3 ruin an otherwise remarkable album,"This is an absolutely gorgeous symphony that's been marred by corrupt file quality in tracks 2 and 3 for sure. I haven't listened past track 6 - I was just too frustrated with digital feedback and popping earlier in the recording to continue.Amazon is aware of the problem and is supposed to be working on it. In the meantime, I recommend against buying this version of an otherwise amazing symphony."
5,The meaning of 'democracy',"This work is an essential history of the usage of the term 'democracy' as this crystalized in the era of the 1840's leaving Marx and Engels stranded with a series of acute but now misleading assertions and critiques of its meaning and actual content. The more is the pity since these views of Marx and Engels were at the onset far more democratic than those who fixed the word's meaning. Small wonder a legacy of bitterness festers here. To this is added the unfortunate confusion over the term, 'dictatorship of the proletariat, and the thinking of Marx is indeed ambiguous in this regard. The perceptions of those passing through the revolutions of 1848 are hard to reconstruct, as the brief alliance of classes led to the victory of one and the betrayal of the rest. This factor is what is responsible for the mistruct of 'democracy so-called'in the name of democracy in Marx and Engels, in a period before universal suffrage was an intrinsic part of the word 'democracy'."
1,"Terrible display, bad customer service","I purchased the German model of this. The display was not readable and it crashed often. Etaco customer ""service"" was awful, and they are charging me shipping and restock fees even though the unit was defective. Buy another brand."
4,love,"my 3.5 yr old daughter loves it.she played it for a week, excited but after about 3 weeks...... left it on the box :("
2,Not Engaging,"I got the My First LeapPad and several books, including The Wiggles one, for my daughter, who was 2-going-on-3 at the time. She really had no interest in it. Maybe it wasn't appropriate for her age level? Who knows. But she still has no interest in it, and I'm just waiting for the next garage sale in my neighborhood so I can sell the whole thing. There's nothing inherently wrong with it. It works fine. It just doesn't spark with my kids, and I am not going to enforce MANDATORY FUN rules."
3,Interesting!,House of Wax (1933) is an interesting pre-code movie and one of the earliest color movies! It's not the best movie ever made and is definitely a B movie but it's interesting and entertaining.
3,white chai,I prefer the taste of black chai tea. White chai tea probably has more anti-oxidents and other useful substances since it is processed less.
4,Sega Bass Fishing,"This game is a must buy for fishing enthusiests and gamersalike. The graphics are so realistic it's like your actually there.I recommend using the DC controller instead of the fishing rod. Why? It just seems easier to control the fish that way. Maybe it's just me. In any event, this is another great title for the Dreamcast. Get one today! END"
2,Major Disapointment,"I really thought this game was going to be great. The sampler disc that comes with the Dreamcast has a demo of the first level of the game and I really enjoyed playing it. I got a copy of this game and was quickly disapointed to learn that there are only three levels (plus a fourth hidden level) in the game. I was completely done with the game 15 minutes after popping into the console. Major disapointment! I envsioned a game with dozens of levels that would provide hours of fun, but found that not to be the case. The animation and game play are pretty cool, but the short gamespan made for a bummer of an experience."
1,How much fun can fishing be!,"Keep in mind, I played the game once and was uterly boarded with the game. Graphics and content is good, however,as a non-fishing sports fan, I found it as entertaining as a major network televising fishing. I have a buddy who bought the game as is somewhat of a fisherman who thinks it's the bomb."
3,SEGA BASS FISHING (READ),This game is fun for a not so serious gamer but I bought my game at BEST BUY for 99cents. This game is VERY EASY to beat but it is fun
5,Very informative,"Federal Disability Law in a Nutshell is a well written work explaining some of the finer points of disability law. I am not certain I would suggest paying full price for it now, as much of the information provided is available for [...]"
1,2 Connectors broke on day 1,"After 8 hour home theater install, 2 of the cable tips broke off when the installers of home theater system unplugged cables from receiver. They now need to come back and finish installation tomorrow with new cables.....these may be fine for low complexity installation, but anyone doing anything more complex, going through wall, etc.. should probably avoid...."
1,video/audio installer,"i'm so unlucky to bye this just want to let you guys know this brand is terrible i have waiting for just this hdmi cable to finish my whole home theatre system. After i install them and need to moved my amplifler in position the hdmi is cracked and broke a part the hdmi wire and the hdmi adapter is loosed a part from each other just like that. that mean rubber housing is too bad is doesn't hold good and i can see how they connect it together , just one soldering the ground wired."
5,Love it!,I love all Kaffe Fassett's books. Even though I don't intend to make a quilt the magic of his art work is a must see.
5,great scooter,"This is my third elec scooter and it works great. the nine inch tires traverse floor divisions smoothly and surprising work a lot better on the lawn than eight inch tires, there is enough foot room to carry boxes, it has almost as much power as my large scooter and considerably more than my pride go-go, which is important to me as I have installed four foot incline ramps into my home , the controls are very smooth"
2,I Would Have Given It 4 Stars If It Didn't Break So Easily.,"At first I liked the feel of this controller, but soon it got annoying.I kept accidently pushing the auto and the fire butttons. The character in the game then started moving by itself,and I had to reset the game. Plus, the controller broke in about a month, which didn't make me like it any better. I would suggest buying the Nintendo brand."
2,ok but not to good,"I have the controler and it is really nice, but it moves for you so you always move forward. In WWF Wrestlemania 2000 it chants the whole time and you can't move.i have heard other people have the same problem with it."
2,?,This product wasn't that good. I dont know about the others but my one always kept pushing imaganary butons. It got really annoying because in games like golden eye I couldent stay still and kept running into the line of fire.
1,"not only does not work, is dangerous.","I bought this because it was cheap and looks cool with its transparent design. but it came with a badly frayed cord wrapped loosely in electrical tape. I plugged it in and within a few seconds of playing with it, it forced my N64 to shut off and not turn back on for several hours. it had me very worried! so I re-wired it and tried it again and it did the same thing! the only reason I am not returning it is so I can use the stick for spare parts."
5,batteries great --shipping not so free,when I ordered them. they came postage due. they didn't put enough postage on it and I had to pay extra.
4,Maxell CR2025 Battery,"The Maxell CR2025 battery is a good battery for most all electronic devices using this type battery. It works well and maintains it's power as needed. I noticed, my use, this battery does not last as long as the Energizer CR2025 but is a lot cheaper to buy. Overall, I would recommend this battery for most all electronic devices. It's longevity is sufficient coupled with it's lower cost makes it a winner in my opinion."
5,The joyful singing of the Christmas Belles,"This album oozes class. The voices of these consumate singers in their prime puts most modern renditions to shame. The highlights for me are the oft neglected 'That's what I want for Christmas', sung by Nancy Wilson, and the sultry Eartha Kitt's 'Santa Baby'. Eartha's earthy rendition make's Madonna sound 'like a virgin'. I have only one gripe...the embarassing 'Christmas time is here', sung by Rosemary Clooney. It was recorded in 1994 when Rosemary was way past her prime. But there are 13 pearls on this album and only one piece of grit."
3,good book but there are better ones,This is a good and practical book. But not as good as Linda Richardson's one. Read them both or prioritize on Lina's book on choaching sales.
2,Nice Drill but Plastic Internal Part Broke,"My Makita 6408 drill has been used for household projects for several years. It has a very nice feel to it and has functioned very well.Recently, while using the drill the plastic cooling fan blade inside the drill shattered into three pieces. A replacement for this part (part 11 on the Makita exploded parts drawing) is not available for sale separately and presumably must be replaced by installing an entirely new armature assembly that has a part cost approximately 2/3 the value of a new drill.I removed all the broken bits and put the drill together again without a replacement plastic fan blade. I am assuming the drill will function fine as long as I don't use it for prolonged periods of time.But now I regard it as a light duty drill only and wish it had not broken in the first place."
2,I thought Makita made quality tools at one time,"I had this make and model for about 5 years. The drill developed some problems soon after I bought it, most notably a trigger defect that made running it a hassle. The chuck was another problem because it got worn out so that it could not be tightened although my use was not extensive. A new chuck cost almost as much as new drill so I opted to buy a new one of a different brand."
4,Good book on this subject,"It is really well written, but only for those who really want to make IT project management this much complicated. I guess project managers dealing with really big IT projects would need this knowledge. For others, it is good to know how an IT project is successfully managed, though for most of the projects which most of the IT professionals deal with on daily basis don't need that much complications.This book quotes a lot of very good real life examples where IT projects fail because of bad management or succeed because of good management.Key point which I learned from this book was that NO IT project completes in time, and all of them take twice the estimated time, so after making a plan for an IT project, give yourself twice the time to complete your project than what you have estimated, otherwise it is destined to fail because it'll not complete on time and in the last minute you'll rush to complete it as soon as possible, and that is where you'll make mistakes."
4,2nd edition W/ CD ROM,"Nice book.....No marks No highlights, Has CD ROM....If the Book wasnt printed back in 2002 You'd think this book was new ,just breezed threw on a shelf at the supermarket by shoppers.The Books pages are stiff and firm... Great. From this suppler this book I happen to get is a great copy with attached CD"
4,Good buy,"The book arrived as expected, in the condition that was advertised. I was very happy with the prompt service."
4,Information Technology Project Management,"I am pursuing my Masters in Information Systems and have read many technical books over the last two to three years but this one is refreshing in that it is easy to understand and is not boring, making for an easy read. I like that all the key definitions from the chapter are at the end including a brief summary of the chapter. I also like that it discusses relevant topics of today such as Six Sigma. All in all, I give this book 4 stars."
3,AWESOME!,Came in great timing! adds great accent and color to the room instead of the big empty wall space!its a little more see through then i would like but other then that i am happy!
3,flag not banner,"I was thinking ""banner"" instead of flag. Hung as a banner the design is all cattywampus. Must pay attention when ordering. But it arrived quickly and is well made."
4,This is a great cd !,"This is a really good album. Here's a song-by-song review:1.Another Dumb Blonde - This is a good song (#3). It was in the Nickelodian movie Snow Day. A good girl power song.2.What You Need - This song is Ok (#5). It has good lyrics and a nice beat.3.How Do I Feel (The Burrito Song) - This is my 2nd fav. song (#2). I like it's beat and it has cool lyrics.4.Just Enough - I love this song (#1). It's really pretty and it's catchy. If you don't like it, then you're just a NERGET !(don't ask)5.Oxygen - This is a good song (#4). It's catchy and fun.6.Nothing In This World - I don't like this song (#10)7.In The First Place - This song is Ok (#6)8.Every Time - I don't like this song (#9)9.I'm Scared - I don't like this song (#11)10.We Will Follow The Sun - This song is Ok (#7)11.You First Believed - I don't like this song (#10)"
4,Cute & Original,"I fell in love with Hoku's hit ""perfect day"" from Legally Blonde. And her cd is just as cute! Yes, I do believe that this cd was made for the teens & under, but I still enjoy it today. Hoku has put together cute & original lyrics that we all can relate to! I recommend it to girls of any age."
5,The Best of the Blondes,"I got the ""Another Dumb Blonde"" single as soon as I saw SNOW DAY. I got this CD as soon as soon as I saw it! This is the only CD I have that I can put in, play and not touch the skip button. I LUV THIS CD! I played it so much I have every word of every song memorized! ON A SCALE 1-10 1 another dumb blonde 10. 2 what you need. 10 3 how do i feel(the burrito song)10. 4 just enough 10. 5 oxygen 10. 6 nothing in this world 10. 7 in the first place 10. 8 every time 10. 9 i'm scared 10. 10 we will fallow the sun 10. 11 you fist believed 10 hope this helps!! Ps: the guy on #9 is her friend from Hawii"
5,Hoku,"I think that this is a wonderful cd for girls of all ages. I am 13yrs and I really love her cd. Most of the songs she writes, you can relate to. My favorite song of hers and over all is Just Enough, because that is how I feel about my boyfriend-I can relate to it. I personally recomend this cd because all of the songs are clean, so moms and dads, it's an o.k. cd for your children. She is a good role-modle for kids. I hope this helps all of you people that are looking for a good cd."
3,hoku,"cute album.I remember watching her video when I was a teen, too bad she didn't get any attention for this album because some songs on here are good."
5,News on Hoku ......,"First of all, FANTASTIC album.An update on Hoku, for those who are interested. I found a site called www.ola-vista.com (Ola Vista Records). On that site it gave Hoku's new website ""www.myhoku.com"". On Hoku's site it says ""New Music Coming Soon"". The site has 2005 on it, so this would mean it relates to a second album. Yes, I am looking forward to it too. You go girl!!!"
4,Hoku,"I have to say, I like Hoku! She is pretty, and has claimed that she will never stoop to such a level as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, which I believe as relief for all of us. She sings mainly feel-good pop songs that don't get you too unessecerily worked up after each listen. Some may refer to it as ""cheesy pop"", but it's better then some albums (Which will not be named) that I have heard before. My favorite songs are Hoku's hits ""Dumb Blonde"", and ""How Do I Feel?"". The other songs ARE kind of slow, but I haven't listened to them too much, so I can't really say.I personally think it's sad that Hoku didn't get a chance at a second album, and I hope she'll be given that oppurtunity someday!This review was brought to you by,GMM (Gold Mew Mew)"
5,Great music for all ages!,"My family of 4 absolutely fell in love with the music while watching the movie ""Snow Day"". We searched and searched to find out who this wonderful voice belonged too. We ran up to our locat department store and purchased the 'last one' as soon as we found out. Hoku does a great job at pronuncing the words so old and young can enjoy her music. Our 7 yr. old daughter sits down every morning after breakfast and sings the lyrics to the songs. It's a definite MUST BUY for every family!"
4,Really Good!,"When I first heard about Hoku, I thought she would just be another Britney Spears imitation. But one day I was flipping through the channels on TV and I saw the ""Another Dumb Blonde"" music video on Nickelodeon, since it was on the ""Snow Day"" movie soundtrack. I really liked the song because it caught my attention, and I really liked the melody, so I bought the single before the CD came out. Hoku has a nice voice, but to me it's really nothing great. But the good thing about Hoku is that she isn't a carbon copy of Britney Spears, Mandy Moore, or Christina Aguilera- she really is different from them. She isn't trendy and clueless, but she does her own things and tries really hard. If you've heard the song ""Another Dumb Blonde"", then I think you should consider getting this CD because you might enjoy it for some good listening."
2,"Okay songs, but voice is worse than sub-par","I liked the album okay but her voice is not at all impressive and her songs aren't that great. If you are looking for a fun, upbeat album you should get Mandy Moore's new one, coming out tomorrow, or Britney Spears, but Britney's new songs sound ALOT like her old one's., so you should REALLY hold out for Mandy Moore's new one"
3,"Pretty Cool, I guess","Her single ""Another Dumb Blonde"" and ""Nothing in This World"" are the only songs I actually like. Her other songs are okay, but it sounds like she is just talking, not singing. She doesn't have a very powerful voice, and u can't really feel the emotions she's putting in the song. Even though she is the daughter of Don, maybe it skipped a generation."
2,Could use a lot of work,"I really don't like Hoku's voice. it is too airy and unmatured. The songs are OK I guess. None of them really stand out as being really catchy pop songs. Not recommended, but Britney's new album rocks!"
3,"She has good songs, a good voice, but she's nothing new","All these female pop singers that are coming out are getting on my nerves. Britney is the pop princess, Christina Aguilera is the Soul Princess, and Jessica Simpson is either the either the next Mariah Carey or Celine Dion judging by her voice. I like those three. They all have a distinct originality. Hoku doesn't really have anything in her music to distinguish her. Hoku's songs are okay, the stand out ones are Another Dumb Blonde, How Do I Feel, and Just Enough. She doesn't really show much vocal strength as Christina or Jessica. Her songs are just so bland and boring. They all have the same mentality, happy, summery like which i would grow out of. My advice: Take it or leave it."
2,Don't Like Her Lyrics,"Well, I suppose her music is ok but I do not her lyrics. Speaking of which, her voice doesn't sound that great to me."
2,Blah,"I did not like this cd. She's trying to be something she isn't (aka Britney, Christina..). Many of the songs were extremly annoying. Need I say more?"
1,don't be fooled,"OK. You may have first been attracted to Hoku's music when you first heard her sing in legally blonde 1. Her ""Perfect Day"" Song is ultra-super-fantasticly cool, don't get me wrong. But checking out her other songs.......P.U.!!!!! She is basically just another teen trying out her abilities at the microphone."
2,Hoku Is Another Dumb Blonde!,"Hoku can sing, but her songs are dumb. No offense. I just *can't* stand, ""Another Dumb Blonde,"" I used to *love* that song, but it got too old. I'm not saying not to buy this CD, but shes just another Pop-Teen-Princess."
1,horrible,"it was the worst music I ever heard! I bought it because my friend said it was good. After I listened to it once, I threw it out right away! I recomend that no one buy it because it is such a waste of money! Hoku is such a britney spears wannabe! No words can explain how bad it was."
1,A One Hit Wonder,"I am a music lover. I love everything from Britney Spears to The Dixie Chicks. However, this was one of those albums that I only listened to once, and that was the day that I brought it. I loved the single ""Another Dumb Blonde""-- when it first came out. The rest of the album was overproduced trying to sound like Britney pop. It was awful, full of slow songs. There is not one fast dance song like her first single. It is just a really bad album. I mean yea she has a nice voice, but every song sounds the same. I think its just a waste of your money. Anyway I think she is a one hit wonder becuase she only had one single off this album, and unless her next album is much better she won't be around for too long."
3,Not just another dumb blonde,"Hoku has a lot of talent for a new, young artist. Her music is fun and upbeat. Some of the songs are a little cliche, but tracks like ""Another Dumb Blonde"" and ""We Will Follow the Sun"" make up for it."
4,I really enjoyed it,"Great music, good lyrics, a real sincerity in her voice. I think she has a bright future."
3,Hoku - Not Too Hokey...,"Sure, its run-of-the-mill, poppy-dancey, borderline teen drivel but, for what it is, it ain't bad. I own very little of this type of music but, when I'm in the mood, I'm glad its there. This album is full of very catchy tunes that pop into my head hours (or even days) after I last heard them. There is really only one track I don't care for and that's because its a duo with some dude. I hate duos with some dude. I wish female singers would stop doing that, but I don't see it happening any time soon.I checked out some of the other artists/albums under the Amazon heading 'Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought' and very few were as good as this one.The novelty may soon wear off, but after a couple weeks of ownership I'm still enjoying it..."
3,Nothing Stands Out Much,"This album is very average. Accept for ""Another Dumb Blonde,"" which I have enjoyed from the first time I heard it, these songs are very mediocre both vocally and lyrically. Nothing much about this album stands out. It isn't bad either, so just check out the song samples or find some other way to preview it first."
5,THE ULTIMATE ALBUM OF SUMMER 2000,"I bought this album in the Summer of 2000 when the video for Another Dumb Blonde Was out and when the song was zooming up the radio charts. At first you may think HOKU's voice is too dull and flat, but actually she has a very soft voice that is innocent and can mesmerize anyone that listens to her music, if they have a heart! Any teen can relate to the songs. The best songs on the album are everyone of them but the ones I listen to the most are the title track and What You Need, which is my personal favorite song on the album. I listened to this album constantly during the Summer because it puts you inthat sunny , light, and feel good mood. My favorite album thus far."
3,No Battery!!!,"Amazon ships this without a battery. The ad doesn't mention this. Watch out, you will end up buying a battery and charger in addition to the costs shown above!!!"
4,worth it for one recipe alone,"i've had this book for something like thirteen years now, it's a classic of course and my copy is falling apart it's so well-used. all the recipes i've tried have been well-conceived, well-explained and really good, though i should mention that a few of the dishes sound so dull i haven't even tried them. but only a few, and that's true of any cookbook. but all that is beside the point, since this book is worth FAR more than $16.95 for one recipe alone: the spinach lasagna bechamel. it's just ridiculously good, and you will make it over and over, whether you're veggie or not (i am not). if only for that recipe, you can not miss with this cookbook and i highly recommend it."
3,Ahead sticks suck!,They break easily they cost too much and Ahead has every excuse in the book not to warranty them. They break cymblas easily too. The only good thing is they leave no wood chips/dust...
4,what I expected,Pretty simple review they cover the metal drumsticks like they are supposed to and are durable but hey thats their job.
1,70's?,"I don't know why people insist on remembering the 70's simply for its Disco invasion and the wealth of soul that was indeed coming into the picture around that time. People don't seem to remember all the great, innovative Rock music of the 70's. Groups like Queen, Genesis, Pink Floyd...these are the groups that make the 70's a great decade for music. This is not to say that the music on this album was not an important part of the 70's because it was. But in attempts to capture the essence of the entire decade one should never leave out Bohemian Rhapsody,The Wall...remember Abba? David Bowie? The Kinks? Hip-Hop had even already made its appearance with The Last Poets, Gil Scott Heron, Sugarhill Gang. I think there are too many unimportant & similar tracks on this album for it to be called ""the 70's."" It doen't even scratch the surface."
2,what happened?,"what happened to the song that we heard all throughout the promos...oohh child..things are gonna get easier? this could have been a MUCH better soundtrack, if they had tried a little bit harder."
4,Good Blend of Songs for a 70's Soundtrack!,"This Compact Disc blends the decade of the 70's into one CD fantastically! I thouhgt that they were right on with the Elton John, Donna Summer, Blondie, Marvin Gaye, and Barry White songs, and even though some of the songs I would replace, it still is a fantastic CD, and a great buy. Amazon.com is the place to buy this wonderful CD, and don't hesitate! This is a remarkable compolation of music and get it now!"
2,At least it was better than the movie itself!,"With any miniseries that tries to encapsulate a decade into a two-nighter headbanger, you're bound to come up with nitpicking sessions in which music, acting, screenplay et al can be literally torn to shreds.In the case of The 70's, Nixon would have been proud of the cookie-cutter shredding that was done with certain events.Concentrating mainly on the music though, while I loved Wonder's ""Superstition"" and the Airplane's ""Miracles"", there was simply no inclusion of several bands which topped the charts during the Me Decade. No mention of Fleetwood Mac? Heart? Kansas' ""Dust in the Wind"".Since the exclusions far outweigh the inclusions, it's too simple to continuously name the songs that could or should have been in this soundtrack. Needless to say, it might have been better."
2,Typical,This is Typical Compilation.Who Doesn't Know these Songs&Artists? it's Business as Usual.a Great Chance too really come out right in a very Diverse Decade but it's all for not.A wasted chance.
3,And Now anther bad Mini Series form NBC,"The music by itself is great. But, shame on NBC to try and make money off of those who love 70's music. I think those of us with a brain know where to find 70's music without paying for it again. Check out discjockey.com and streem it in for free. Next NBC will probably do the 1980's, How Original!"
1,Is That It?,"Where are the rest of the songs that were featured on the show? Obvisiouly there are many songs missing...The three songs that I loved are not even on the CD...If you are going to have a ""soundtrack"" you SHOULD include ALL songs!"
1,Many omissions!,"I agree with another reviewer who noted that many excellent songs from the show itself are missing from the CD. A couple songs by Joni Mitchell and Rare Earth - rarely heard on classic rock radio - are two examples that come to mind. I'm baffled why 1)the best songs were left off the soundtrack, and 2)how it can be called a soundtrack with so many songs left out! I had intended to buy the CD but when I saw the list of songs, I changed my mind."
1,A terrible soundtrack for a terrible movie.,"This disc is so mainstream, it's pathetic. NBC decided to take the safe road by repackaging a Ktel collection as a movie soundtrack. Where's Paper Lace's ""The Night Chicago Died""? The Bay City Rollers? The Partridge Family? These lame acts were what the 70's were all about! They were too rebellious for this collection. So NBC puts on the disc songs we can hear in about three hours on your average oldies station? A pithy collection at best."
3,"Good, but not great","These plastic registration/insurance wallets are nice, but there's a problem: the plastic windows they use to hold the documents in place don't age well in a car that gets subjected to cold and heat. After about 12 months, they become a wrinkled mess, and the ink on the documents sticks to the inside of the windows. So I wind up throwing the thing out and buying a new one. I've probably gone through about a dozen of them this way. Fortunately, they're cheap so I suppose if you're willing to replace the wallet every time you get a new insurance card, they're okay. Right now I'm looking for a longer-lasting solution."
5,It's great!,Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Brand new and good quality. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something similar.
5,Wallet,This wallet came in very handy in keeping all documents in one place since I had purchase a second vehicle.
4,As advertised,Great to keep your paperwork organized and at the ready. Good price too. Keeps your insurance and registration at the ready.
2,Not as good as advertised,I bought this wallet because of the good reviews but I ended up having to buy something else. This wallet is crudely made and the materials look really cheap. I would only recommend it to people that want to leave it in the glove box â if you want to carry it on you I would recommend buying something that looks more respectable.
4,Car Registration Wallet,The registration wallet is exactly as described. It has a velcro closure and 2 pockets in which to place your documents. Made of plastic material.
2,Skip this one.,"The Golden Gizmo is a tall tale which meanders aimlessly, ultimately winding up nowhere. Written with sufficient surrealism to easily accomodate a supporting character that happens to be a talking dog, there just isn't anything here to engage the reader's interest.The main character, Todd Kent, is an early incarnation of Roy Dillon, the young L.A. con artist Thompson so masterfully brought to life in The Grifters. But that's where any similarity between the two novels begins and ends.The Golden Gizmo is a real clunker. Sometimes even great writers like Jim Thompson will step up to the plate and strike out. Not recommended."
2,Mission Improbable,"This is almost a decent novel. If it didn't come from the author of that masterpiece, ""The Grifters,"" I might have given it an extra star or two.What's really painful is that there's a lot of good stuff here. The characters, as always, are fascinating. And only Jim Thompson could make a talking dog a convincing player in a noir thriller! But his cleverness here only serves to highlight his childish plot gimmicks. When you find out what happened to The Missing Body, you'll want to scream in frustration."
2,Technically flawed recording,"I leave it to others to characterize the performance and its merits. Whatever they may be, they're deeply compromised by the technical failure of the finished production. A narrow soundstage, the dryness of the strings and a near-complete loss of Andsnes' justly celebrated tonal palette compare poorly with the promotional video, a fine rehearsal session with decidedly more generous audio qualities. I'll keep the disc - it's interesting on other levels - but won't reach for it except perhaps as an example of expert performance denatured in its journey from concert hall to finished disc."
4,The best orchestra; but the pianist is little weak,"Rachmaninov's first concerto can be labeled ""Baby Rachmaninov."" It was written by Rachmaninov when he was 17/18 (I forgot) and revised before he left for America. Like a lot of people I am a great fan of his second concerto. His first concerto, although less grand in scope, and perhaps less heavy and sorrowful than the second, is very melodic and taunting.Andsnes interpretation is very neat/clean. He does not distort the music too much. So as long as you appreciate the music you don't get sick of it. But you may not get addicted to it since it lacks subtance and unique touch by the pianist. Andsnes does a very poor job in the climax. It definitely is not heavy and grand as it can be. Otherwise the beginning chords and melody are nice, and the orchestra is great.The second concerto is HORRIBLE (which is very noticeable, because there are so many great recordings to compare to) In my opinion, Andsnes lacks the spirit of Rachmaninov."
4,What fun!,"I was pleased with this video. The editing and flow of the various performances is seamless. Ms Mor has the flare and energy that make the dance exciting. A nice display of costumes and techniques. A taste of veil, floor and even sword. I was not disapointed."
2,oh please,"I found this video to be boring. Ms. Mor seems to be a little full of herself and the editing was probably her attempt to cover her many flaws. I felt that the skimpy costumes we only a way for her to ""cover up"" her inability to be a true performer."
1,BAD...VERY BAD!,"Amira Mor belly dances like a stripper with no feeling, timing or technique. This just brings the art to the depths of hypocrisy. Amira Mor dances as if it were a Go-Go show instead of Oriental belly dancing. The two are not the same. It is sad to see this art so poorly represented by a classless and tasteless person with no talent. It sets a bad presedent for what the real art is and is not. This is NOT belly dancing, it is a stripper that thinks because she can gyrate her hips (out of time to the music I must add) that she is a professional belly dancer...NOT!Save your money and buy from a professional belly dancer, NOT Amira Mor and her embarassing DVD's.The video quality was also very poor and the editing was choppy."
5,The MTV Generation,"I thoroughly enjoyed this performance video. Being a dancer, myself, I purchase many belly dance videos and was very pleased with this offering from Amira Mor. Her dancing is spectacular and she is quite stunning. I would love to see more videos from her, including a teaching video. She has a style that is exciting to watch and should be shared."
