1,Product is bad,"In much the same vein as other folks' reviews, I wouldn't bother again with this tool or the Arrow brand. I bought the tool, which looked returned, from Home Depot. Came home, plugged it in, nothing. I kept thinking that I was forgetting something and kept checking electrical outlet, nails, etc but nothing, it was just dead from the store."
1,Arrow ET200 - JUNK,"I bought this item - the most expensive version sold by Lowes - thinking it would surely work best and have no troubles. I foolishly banked on the Arrow name. The gun fired three 1"" brads then did absolutely nothing. Only one of the three brads penetrated the plastic baseboard and drywall into a pine 2X4. I was sure that I was the problem, but the instruction manual had no trouble-shooting section and gave no hints.I didn't have time to fool with this thing, so drove 65 mile to Lowes (again) and exchanged it for another one. Same model - same result. It fired three (3) brads then NOTHING. Still sure it must be my fault I turned to internet reviews only to find that this experience is common and the tool is JUNK.Tomorrow I will drive 65 miles to Lowes (3rd time) and return it, but I won 't get cash back because it takes Lowes 2 weeks to figure out if my originak check was good - even though I spent $6000. dollars there in the last 2 months."
1,There is no use for this,There isn't a conceivable use for this product. I couldn't find a pice of wood that this gun could penetrate with me putting all my weight behind it. I honestly believe that my desktop stapler fires with more power. Shame on me for not reading the reviews.
1,Weak nailer - pretty good doorstop,"Even though it accepts brads up to 1.25"", it won't drive them more than .5"" into soft pine. It's pretty useless, really."
4,It's a Cheap Electric Finish Nailer; It's Not a Fancy Pneumatic.,"I was given this as a gift after I complained a lot that I hated doing finish work. Then, after a year with no trim in our newly renovated bathroom, this made the job seem easier, and I finished it. I like it.Just recently, I pulled my ET200 out of the basement to use on some 1x6 pine boards we are using as facia around a couple of eaves over some doors on the side of the house. The nailer left the nails hanging out about a half an inch. After some deducting reasoning, I discovered that the 100' drop cord we were using was the culprit.After I replaced the long drop chord with a 20' (and larger gauge) drop cord, the nailer worked perfectly. It definitely made the job quicker, easier, and more enjoyable.This nailgun has worked well for everything except nailing through maple and oak. For the price, this was a worthwhile purchase for me."
5,Great!,"I got this book when I was learning how to knit, and it helped me a lot! I already knew how to do the stitches so it helped me a lot when it came to reading patterns and understanding some techniques. Great initiation book!"
1,Doesn't heat evenly...sticks to the bottom! Nonstick is thin.,"I had the older version of this 6 quart nonstick slow cooker, and it was 100% better than this one. I should have returned this rather than keep it. I don't know if it is because of the stainless on the outside, but this cooker doesn't heat evenly at all. The temperature knob jumps by itself, too! Nice feature...NOT! The nonstick coating is VERY THIN, and things do stick to the bottom of it. I've never used metal utensils with this pan, yet the coating is peeling off. I say, don't buy it! It is very hard to control the heat to a good simmer, and with the jumping temperature knob, it really makes things worse. I would not trust leaving this alone in my home without supervision. So to sum it up...food sticks on the bottom, doesn't heat evenly, temperature control knob moves on its own, nonstick coating is thin and cheap, and peels off. This is an insult to the West Bend name!"
2,Beware of coating peeling,I purchased one of these after having 2 of the older models which I loved. I was so disappointed in the new stainless steel version. The non stick coating bubbled up around the handle rivets and started to peel off. The pot is useless unless you don't mind picking out non stick coating. Called West Bend about the problem and was told they'd be happy to sell me a new pot. Would not recommend.'
1,Keep your money,"This product was a huge disappointment. I bought this after my other one died. It was given to me by my father-in-law and was about 20 years old. I splurged and got the most expensive one in the store thinking it would be the best. I have tried several items in it and they have all been way undercooked, even on high temps. I have to continue to cook in the oven or stove to finish it off. The whole point of me getting a slowcooker was to come home to dinner already prepared, not more cooking. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
2,Not happy,"I pretty much baby everything I own and take great strides in protecting the non-stick coating of my cooking materials. However after the second use of this appliance, the inside of the pot started to pit in one spot. I only used plastic utensils to stir the food while cooking. I am not happy!"
5,annettte,I LOVE my new West Bend slow cooker. It replaces a smaller one I had for years that finally just quit. I love that the pot sits on the cocking element and does not weigh a ton like the new slow cookers. I hope this one also lasts years and years.
2,Very disappointed with the quality.,The inside coating is peeling badly after less than a dozen uses! And I am very careful cleaning the interior!My old West Bend model lasted 20 years. Lousy quality.
1,Peeling teflon,"Ordered this slow cooker in January,2012. Slow cooker has never been in the dishwasher always wshed by hand. My wife was washing the pot this morning and the teflon coating came off in two spots each about 2"" X 1"" in length. I will be looking for a new slow cooker and it will not be a West Bend product."
5,Best Ever!,"I had my old West Bend for 51 years, and it has been well used, and it had it's problems. My new one is a dream. The stainless looks wonderful, is easy to clean, and cooks beautifully, and is a larger capacity. I hope I get as many years of use as the old one. I love it."
3,Not so flat!,"This cooker was a disappointment in the fact, the actual cooking vessel did not sit flat on the cooking base. It had a left to right wobble. I would imagine that is why some people said it had hot spots (center was higher than the sides) I was upset about this fact and my better half took it to the work shop and I have no idea what he did but it is now flat to the cooking surface. No wobbles.Be aware of this and you will not be disappointed."
4,Great Cooker with a few kinks in design,"I just purchased this pot a month ago and have used it 3 times. I made a roast and tried to brown it on the stove before slow cooking, but my stove is a glass top and I had some problems. As the pot heated it started to spin on the glass top because it is oval shaped and my burners are round (I think that's why). So I used a bridge burner on my stove to provide more even heating and that improved the problem, but didn't eliminate the clumsiness of use completely. Second item I made was a roast using the heating element on the pot to start the browning, but it is not designed to get very hot so it didn't really brown the meat, but the food turned out great anyway. Last I made pancakes on the skillet portion and it doesn't have temperature levels so I wasn't sure how high to heat it, but I figured out a good level and that dish turned out fine as well. SO overall success was great, but feeling a bit new at the details has caused a little concern."
1,Not usable on glass top stove,"This item does NOT work with a glass top stove. As it heats up, for browning meat, the bottom rounds out and rocks on the glass top. Only a small portion of the bottom makes contact with the glass top stove. I called West Bend customer service and this is a problem they are addressing."
5,WHAT COOKER,THIS IS THE BEST SLOW COOKER I HAVE USED IN YEARS.. IT HEAT UP VERY QUICKLY.. THIS REALY SURPRISE ME. MY OTHER SLOW COOKERS TOOK A LONG TIME TO HEAT UP..I WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE ..I DEARLY LOVE THIS SLOW COOKER.SHHARON K
3,Non stick coating started to come off.,Replaces our old 5 quart rectangular west bend. They all would last forever if the non stick interior would last also. The lift out roast rack is great but it is going to rust away in a couple of years. We dont use it on top of the stove or the heat plate to cook things like pancakes. We like the fact that the pot will never break like some crockery slow cookers have with us. ****** True! Had to call company for a replacement pot. It was a different style but the non stick seems to be holding up so far after about a year.
5,Best EVER,This is the 3rd one we have had-Same brand-LOVE IT!!!!Only change I would even suggest is to make them in Stainless Steel-No peeling in cookery bottom then.
1,DO NOT BUY,"Do not buy this slow cooker! I have had one for a couple of years now ... the teflon started coming off my first pot and West Bend replaced it and advised me not to wash it in the dishwasher. Now less than one year later, the teflon is coming off the second one too! It has never been in the dishwasher and has never been used on its highest setting! I have used it on the slow cooking high setting which is about midrange for the knob. I am very disappointed in this crock pot and have purchased another brand!"
5,Best Slow Cooker,"I ordered this slow cooker to replace an oblong 5 qt westbend cooker that I have had for years. Initially, I bought a different brand with a ceramic pot that advertised that it could be used in the oven, microwave or on the stovetop. This pot was awkward, heavy and breakable. It was not adequate for use on the stovetop. The price was at least double the price of the Westbend Versatility.I love the Westbend Versatility! It is lightweight and easy to handle and clean. I can start my food in this pot on the stovetop so I don't have extra cooking dishes. The size is perfect for small portions or large - and it looks nice. At $50.00 is was a real bargain and I plan to buy another one as a gift."
4,Very Nice,"When you first put it on the stovetop (I have gas), the stainless steel bottom will bow up, afterwards, when all the contents are the same temperatue it levels out. Cooks great, very attractive."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I did a lot of research before I bought this cooker. To be honest 'versatility' was the last thing on my list. I have never used a slow cooker before so was reluctant to buy the one I really liked (the All Clad one) because it cost twice the amount that this one did.When I opened the box I wasn't too impressed because I compared the pot to the quality of the All Clad pots and pans I have (not that you would get one of those for this price either). BUT, after using it for a couple of months I am quite impressed.I haven't used the pot on the hob that much, only to reduce liquid at the end of the cooking period and haven't had any of the problems listed, maybe because the pot is already hot.I don't regret my purchase at all although now I know that I am more comfortable with the concept of slow cooking I will probably buy the All Clad one if this ever breaks."
5,LOVE IT !,"I FOUND THIS SLOW COOKER PERFECT FOR WHAT I NEEDED. IT'S A BIG SIZE FOR STEW AND SOUPS. IT'S VERY NICE LOOKING AND CLEANS UP EASILY. ABOUT THE ONLY THING I COULD THINK OF TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IS THE CORD IS TOO SHORT. I ALSO DON'T USE THE LOW SETTING, I USE THE NEXT ONE UP, AND EVERYTHING COMES OUT GREAT. GREAT PRICE TOO!"
4,Good cooker. Best feature: it can go on stovetop or oven.,"This is a nice, but simple, slow cooker. Its advantage, and the reason I got this one, is that it can be put on the stovetop or in the oven, since it is made of metal and is nonstick. This also makes it lighter than most.However, it is not programable, and does not have a remote temperature probe/sensor, as do some models"
4,Works well,"I've used this a few times and find it quite nice as a crock pot, lots of spare room! The hot plate does not heat evenly but functions well enough for grilled sandwiches. All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase."
1,Didn't get the job done...,"After having an ""ol reliable"" Crock Pot that was given to me by my mom (it's about 20 years old), I decided to splurge on something new, After a recommendation by a cooking magazine, I decided to give this a shot. After several tries of cooking roasts, pork chops, and beef stew (which were always done to perfection in the other pot) they were not done after 10-12 hours on High.I'm glad I didn't get rid of my old pot (and glad I kept the receipt -I'm returning it.)"
1,Pot deforms when heated,"When cold, pot lies perfectly flat on the heater (or any flat surface) and makes good contact. When heated, within 15 seconds, pot deforms and makes very poor contact with the heater - it rocks noticeably back and forth when the handles are depressed. Thus things take forever to cook. We had a prior West Bend model that had a heavier pot and did not have this problem. We're returning this model for a refund - it's unusable. Very disappointed."
2,West Bend Slow Cooker,"I purchased this item because it was similar to a previous slow cooker I had from West Bend. However, I have cooked a corn beef and also a rump roast and have been very disappointed. I cooked the corn beef on the low setting as recommended for slow cooking, and cooked it for over 12 hours. It came out tough and the potatoes and carrots were hard. The rump roast I cooked on medium for over 11 hours and it also came out tough and the potatoes, carrots and turnips were hard."
2,Where the heck was the romance?,"Well this book delivered on exactly one thing...mystery. There was absolutely no romance. A couple of chaste kisses(no detail: simply ""they kissed"") and a few bottom gropes do not count as romance. If you want to read a murder mystery then by all means pick up this book but if you want a romance then don't waste your money."
1,Don't Know What People See In It,"I picked up The Stone Forest because I like romantic suspense and it looked interesting. It took me about two years to finally read it, and that should have been a red flag. I read a lot of books, and it can take me a while to get to a book. I like to finish anything I've started and try to give books the benefit of the doubt. I've read some pretty bad books and managed to finish them (The Wish Club by Stella Cameron is one - I could not believe that anyone would actually publish it with all the plot holes and cliched writing) However, I just could not get into The Stone Forrest. I made it as far as chapter five before I just peeked at the end to see whodunit. It was not at all surprising. The characters were just flat and did nothing to raise my interest in what happened to them. And the plot bored me. Seriously. I just did not care, and nothing the author did made any difference.Don't bother with this one is my advice."
3,"Cute, but misleading and cheap.","We ordered this for a part my 5 yr old had in a class play. It does NOT come with the headpiece or the tomahawk. It is only the shirt, belt and pants. The small fit him well. It is definitley cheaply made. It's already coming apart in a couple of places after one handwash. You get what you pay for though. It served the purpose for the play and it was cute. Dissapointed it did not come with the accessories though."
4,What a wonderful world...,"Punk Music: New York or London? Sex Pistols or The Ramones? Who cares because Mongol 800 are keeping punk alive in Okinawa! Go On As You Are is the indie debut from the punk rock trio from Okinawa, Japan and it will leave you wondering what all the fuss is back in the USA over neo-punkmeisters Good Charlotte and their ilk. Mongol 800 is real punk done right."
3,okay,"i like this product, made my legs really shiny and soft. but it has an odd smell. like noodles or something.. i know it's weird. i don't care for it."
4,robert's review,"Had a lot of fun listening to this one. Abdul Abulbul Amir is a favorite since my childhood. There are several other lighthearted songs most oldsters would enjoy especially ""No news"". Mr. Crumit was an unusual entertainer. Not all the songs are hilarious by any stretch of the imagination but listening to them is fun."
3,Just what it says,Book describes how to grow wheat grass and its benefits. You have to be pretty hardcore to drink a lot of this stuff though. I wasn't so I cannot tell you if it really works.
3,Nice book small problem with shipping,I ordered this as part of another order. The book is fine and has lots of helpful information. My problem was with amazon. I accidentally selected 2 day shipping on this book instead of the other item in my cart and tried to change it immediately to no avail. I called amazon and there was nothing that could be done about it after the 30 seconds..... I ended up paying more in shipping than I did for the book. I was advised to decline the delivery and reorder to get a refund processed. I really dislike this policy of not being able to change shipping speeds after the order has been placed. Other than that the book is great. I got it for my grandmother who has the cancer and has exhausted conventional medicine.
5,This book will change your life,"Ann Wigmore gives a thorough analysis of the incredible powers of wheatgrass and how it can improve your health. I must say this book changed my life: wheatgrass juice will improve your health, boost immunity, aid in weight loss, and more. I even feed it to my parrots, and they are ten times healthier now--I haven't lost a single baby bird since I started feeding the parents wheatgrass. This inexpensive of book will save you oodles of money--far fewer medical bills!"
5,An amazing combination.,"Eddy and Troy have had numerous chart toppers, and I know there will be more yet to come from this CD. It is obvious they work well together, and the amazing sound and style that comes from them is nothing but pleasurable to their listeners. I hope they keep the great music coming for years to come."
5,Montgomery Gentry ROCKS!!,"I wasn't even planning on buying this CD. I just happened to see it at Target one time for $10, so I bought it. My favorite songs are ""Gone"", ""If You Ever Stop Loving Me"", ""If It's the Last Thing I Do"", and ""She Loved Me"". ""If It's the Last Thing I Do"" sounds quite a bit like the Brooks & Dunn version, but I think MG's is better :)The only song I have a gripe about is ""I Got Drunk"". It's really stupid to me, but that's just my opinion. Good tune, bad lyrics.MG really put their heart and feeling in this CD, and it shows. They made some GREAT songs on this one.All in all, You Do Your Thing is an AWESOME Cd. It's got some real gems, as well as the great songs you hear on the radio like ""Gone"". It's a MUST HAVE for any country collection!"
1,Cowardly Cowboy Music.,"Nothin like a big cowboy hat, and a gun to make you feel like a man. Shameful and sad."
4,"Their ""Thing"" Suits Me Fine","Nashville's lone rep to the Southern Rock genre stick to what they do best here, releasing song after song that portray an ordinary Southern, rowdy-guy point of view with no apologies. They extol a blue collar ethic (Something to Be Proud Of; It's All Good), broadcast their old fashioned values (You Do Your Thing), brag about wild living (I Got Drunk; I Ain't Got It All That Bad), and then enumerate about its hard toll (I Never Thought I'd Live This Long). What I'm still waiting to hear are more self-penned tunes, such as ""Carrying On's"" ""Lucky to Be Here at All."" Throw off Nashville's yoke, fellas, and tell some of your own stories!"
1,Bleck!!!,"Once upon a time comparisons to Jennings might have been appropos for Montgomery Gentry. No more. Words like Outlaw must be replaced by by words like Tool between, as evidenced by their metro-sexual biker boyz video for the Shania/Mutt re-hash ""If You Ever Stopped Loving Me."" (If you think you heard it before that's because you remember the first time when it was called ""Only God Could Stop Me From Loving You by Emerson Drive."") Montgomery Gentry is like that one dad of your friend who ownes the 76 Yamaha motorcycle--they USED to be cool."
4,Poignant and living,"I discovered Doug Anderson's collection of poetry _Blues for Unemployed Secret Police_ when he was invited to teach a poetry workshop at my high school several years ago, of which I participated in. Doug talked to us about his poetry, his experiences in Vietnam, read some of his poems (from this collection) to us, and then helped us with our own poems by providing critiques. His manner, his poetry, and his humility--as well as his willingness to come to a high school and teach to a bunch of self-important high school students. Doug's poetry is riveting, it draws you in, and its beautiful in its humility. I recommend this collection to everyone."
4,"Timeless, almost","I used this book and a test guide to take the FCC GROL exam, even after it was obsolete. I believe this to be the last edition of this excellent prep guide. The Shrader book is excellent however hard to finish cover to cover by oneself. This will remain on my shelf as a reference for years to come."
1,Kill Me Please,"This film sucks balls. It's hard to hear the actors and I had to adjust my volume continuously throughout the film. Maybe if the director spent time doing his job instead of jacking off he would have noticed. I have nothing personal against homeless hippies and crack whores, but damn... the cast of this film were awful. I recommend setting yourself on fire other than watching this movie."
2,Beneath the Mississippi,"This looked like it might be a somewhat decent movie, if you could hear it. The only things that were audible was the yelling and the background noise (crickets, etc.). At least I didn't pay more then $1.99 for it or I would be asking for a refund."
3,Improvisational train wreck,"What happens when the director shoots a movie without a plot or a point or even a script and lets his famous actors improvise amok? The Port of Shadows. Yes, a few frames of the moody cinematography are worth watching, but you can see one of them for free on the box art. If you like watching high speed artistic train wrecks in super slow motion, then this is the movie for you. It's a 1 star movie plus 1 star for it's historical significance plus 1 star for Criterion's excellent transfer."
5,A must read series!,"Excellent reading! Once you read the first book in this series, you will want to read them all! The story is exciting, thrilling, historical and filled with Christian values. It was a pleasure to read."
3,Nice shoe.,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
5,A great DIY option,"This is a very solid router bit. You've seen the comparisons online and probably wondered how this can be so much cheaper than the others. Don't be fooled by the naysayers who try to make non-premium brands like this one seem sub-par. This Vermont American router bit is not a sub-par product. I used it for an outdoor project (rounding over a hand railing for a deck) and it worked like a charm. Granted, the wood I routed is soft, so I cannot speak for its performance on, say, Brazilian Cherry. But I was very hapy with this purchase, considering the alternative was about four times as expensive."
2,the record brings a smile to one's face mentioning 80's,Not a lot to be said about this album besides it's good memories it will bring me each time I'll think of 80's icons! (not a word about Sam's advantages...)
1,Aural exploitation,"Sex sells. Samantha Fox sells sex, and nothing else. She poses nude and her songs are the aural equivalent of thumbing through a Penthouse magazine.If this calculated, exploitative, manipulative base entertainment is what you like, fine. But don't call her a musician."
2,Trigger switch stopped working after 6 months,"It was refurbished. I should have known the price was too good to be true. Too late to return it, according to the Amazon return rules, so I guess it goes in the trash. Sometimes it will start, but once I set it face down to sand, it just stops. Not very powerful, either, much like a 5 inch, so I'll buy a stronger one next time. But maybe not a Bosch."
5,I Love This Sander,"I build one-of-a-kind furniture. This is my first random orbital sander.When I sand a panel that has board grains perpendicular to each other, then I don't have to sand ""with the grain"". When I sand adjoining perpenducular grains then they both look great.I love this sander !"
1,Problem with this sander,"I've had this sander for about a year. I purchased this based on the many glowing reviews. In general, this is a high quality unit. The spin-break went out almost immediately. The spin-break is the thing that keeps the sanding disc from spinning out of control. I'm hoping that they get this unit back to me soon as I need a 6 inch for work around the house.The reviews stating that the unit sands smoothly as well as the dust collection are accurate. I highly recommend the thin vacuum hose if this item is purchased. Regardless, if the sander doesn't get fixed, it's not much use.3 year update....I received the unit back from repair, and the sanding disc started spinning out of control almost immediately. I sent this item back to the factory for repair, so there should be no question of who was working on it. I still have the sander but simply can't use it like this. Did I get a lemon??"
2,not what I wanted...,"I have read all three of Garcia-Aguileras other books, and liked them all. The only thing I liked about this book was visiting Miami and hearing from Lupe again. The story was just not believable. Many questions were left unanswered and I felt unfulfilled when I finished the book. For example, Lupe goes through the trouble to apply (and get accepted) to a retreat at the nunnery, and then she never goes, and it is not addressed again. Hmmmm? We never find out why the murderer feels the way he does about Cuba, or why the triplets are under his power. I would definely read the next Lupe Solano mystery because I think Garcia-Aguilera has great potential, but this book was not a winner."
2,Disappointing,"I have read and enjoyed the previous books in this series, and this one is a big disappointment. Although Lupe remains an appealing character, the plotting is sloppy and there are too many unresolved questions."
5,Definitely Get One of These For Your Car!,"Along with it being handy to store toys, it is also wonderful to protect your seat from unfortunate spills and sickness. I've had both: broken sippy cup spilled milk all over the car seat and it prevented the milk to soak into my bench seat, and my son got car sick and it kept the vomit from soaking in. What a lifesaver and totally worth the money!!"
2,Faded.,"This is a beautiful necklace. But-- has faded so much, it is now a completely different color than when I got it.The blue that it is now, doesn't go with anything."
5,Fantastic Starting Software,"My son started playing this at 16 months. You can hit any key on the keyboard to make something happen or progress to point-and-click. Thanks to the Mickey and Minnie games my son learned his letters and shapes by 20 months. He also amazed us by learning how to point-and-click at 18 months. He's now 29 months and still enjoys playing some of these games but has progressed to Putt-Putt Saves The Zoo.I have to say that this is one of the best purchases we made for him and it's helped him stay ahead of his playmates when it comes to counting, the alphabet, and his computer skills. Within the coming months we'll probably give the Disney preschool software pack a try."
1,what a headache,I purchased this software for my two year old son. Before he could even try it I had to perform a system restore because it took down my system when trying to install it. I don't know the stores return policy but it is going back. Next time I'll check the reviews before I purchase any software.
2,Not worth the price.,"My toddler gets bored with this very quickly. In my opinion he doesn't seem to learn very much. He learns a lot more from books, videos and of course his mommy! It wouldn't be that bad if it would not jam up everytime he hits the wrong button. It only happens about every 2 minutes...lol. Anyways very frustrating and not worth the price."
3,I love this stuff,"Im a believer, but why do aliens have to communicate like forieners?Clumsy, long winded and confusing."
1,Not to be taken seriously,"I picked up a friend's copy of this and what can I say? I guess the world would be a less entertaining place without these quirky notions.I suppose I should state I have a Ph.D in geology, a field of study which tends to make a person pretty grounded and into critical, hard evidence-based analysis. Which I didn't find in this book - and neither would I, to be frank, have expected to.Accept it for what it is - a bit of entertainment, and its fine.But take it seriously, and well, perhaps a person should consider seeking some help."
2,Dribble,I've read several other books written by Elizabeth Peters and have enjoyed them. But this book was not up to her usual standards. Combine an over use of superfluous adjectives with a weak story line and an unexplained passage of time by the end of the book you earned five stars just for sticking with it.
3,Amelia is not behaving normally,"I think this book has been a disapointment. All of the characters do things they would never normally do. We need to see what Nefret thinks. The characters and plot are getting very dry. Spice them up by changing the setting. Please keep Amelia the way she has always been. If the series are going to center around Ramses now, please make it interesting. Ps, I love Ramses."
3,Is Amelia Losing Steam?,"I can't quite decide about this book. I was disappointed in it because like so many others, I look forward to reading about Amelia et al on my summer vacation. This book is the first in the series that I bought in hardcover, and I am sorry I did. It is fine, but flat, and though I would hate to see the series end, the thought did cross my mind that maybe, Amelia is losing steam. Nefret's actions were seriously out of character, and it will take some work on Elizabeth Peters' part to make me believe whatever story she tells about it. In short, I agree, please no more cliff hangers!"
3,I was disappointed with this installment in the series.,"I always eagerly await the publication of the newest Amelia Peabody installment. However, I was disappointed with this one. It was no better than average. The mystery story line was weak and seemed like an afterthought. The melodrama was overplayed and became the focal point of the book. I do like the way the author inserts segments from other ""sources"" throughout. It adds a nice touch to get the viewpoints of other characters.I hope that the next Amelia story gets back to the tradition of The Snake, The Crocodile, and the Dog and Crocodile on the Sandbank."
2,Ramses and Nefret are just too annoying...,"I am a big fan of the Amelia Peabody series, but this book I could have done without. I am having a hard time caring too much about Nefret, who comes off as totally spoiled. And Ramses...what happened to all his charm? He's now just a sullen taciturn young man without emotional intelligence or maturity.Sigh...I miss Amelia and Emerson!"
3,This was not her best effort.,"I love the Amelia Peabody series, but this one was not up to par. I wish Elizabeth Peters would stick to the formula of finishing the tale in one volume. I do not want to wait months to see what happens with the Nefret/Ramses romance. I missed the romantic interludes between Amelia and Emerson this time - it always adds spice to the narrative. Ms. Peters, get the next one out fast!"
5,Good Job!,"Ms. Peters is one of my favorite author's, and this book is really one of her best. THE FALCON AT THE PORTAL is a real treat to those of us who have been reading this series, though I would like to question some of the charactors actions.PLEASE DON'T KEEP US WAITING!"
3,I was disappointed.,It surpirses me how many readers rave about this story. Like some of the other reviewers I do not like cliffhanger endings. And I was totally put off by Nefret's actions -- she acted worse than the girls she scorned throughout the book. I wonder if Ms Peters is getting bored with this story line and is throwing in bits and pieces of extreme stuff just to add some energy into the action.
4,In agreement - Frustrating!,"Don't get me wrong. This was a very good book and I would highly recommend it, but I was frustrated and disappointed and left without any good feelings at the end. Abdullah's dire warning at the end was not very encouraging. After all of the books in the series you come to care very much for the characters. Some of the things that occurred in this one were upsetting. I hope we do not have to wait long for the next book."
4,I hate cliff hangers,"Like many of other readers, I too want to smack some sense into Ramses and Nefret. Nefret is truely acting like a twit unless some unforseen plot turn in the next book (HE Who Thunders in the Sky due next year) reaffirms her normal good sense. Nefret might pitch a fit, but to take such a permament step such as a wrongful marriage is uncharacteristic. I hope the next book sets things straight. Star crossed lovers (or willfully blind lovers) are amusing for a time, but let's get on with it before I lose all respect for their intelligence. PS in the Last Camel Died at Noon, wasn't Nefret older than Ramses?"
2,"Thoroughly disappointed, yet still hooked","It's a mark of something Elizabeth Peters has done right that I can't wait for the next book, but I find myself irritated and disappointed with the forced ending. Nefret's actions were completely out of character, and Ramses has become a little wooden man--would that he could have some endearing character flaw, like Emerson's temper, or Amelia's stubborness! Ramses is painted like a saint and Nefret, like a silly Victorian piece of fluff, nervous breakdown and all.The mystery in the series is paling (how many times can Amelia be shot at in the desert--and missed? how many tombs can be robbed?) and the romance only works if we care about--and believe in the integrity of--the characters."
4,"no, no, no, no","Story took unusual twist at the end. Had me stompping around the house for hours, repeating no, no, no, no... Could not stand it!"
4,Dont skip this book,"I have just discovered the Amelia Peabody mystery's at our public library and have been reading them all summer, I was lucky enough to begin close to the beginning, (The Mummy's Case) and have read them in order since--until I got to this book, it was checked out, I went on to the next one--don't do it! I had to stop reading and go back to the library and hunt down a copy of Falcon if you skip this one, you wont ""get"" the beginning of ""He shall Thunder..."", I liked this book, but did feel that occassionally it got a bit bogged down and had to reread a few sections to fully understand the meanings of some of prose. I do think Ms. Peters sometimes gets so wrapped up in Victorian Euphemisms, sometimes its a bit hard for those of us in the 21st century to understand--but excellent summer read."
2,Far too upsetting!,"As a true lover of the Amelia Peabody series, I found this one to be far too upsetting, not to mention the unfinished dilemmas. I cried shamelessly over the loss of Abdullah in an earlier book, but found this one to be much worse. What has happened to Nefret's intelligence? Are Amelia and Emerson getting too old to participate in the adventures? One of the main attractions for me in this series is the humor- what's happened to it? Let's hope the next one gets back on track!"
2,-The Falcon at the Portal,"While I've only read three of the Amelia Peabody Mystery's by Peters' (and totally enjoyed each one) this paticular book left me with a sour taste for the book series. The situation with Nefret and Ramases is sad. And Nefret is made out to be well to lack of a better term a ""Hussy"". I want to read the next book in the series but I don't want to be let down again.I hope that the mystery and allure of ""The Ape that Gaurds the Balance"" my favorite in this series so far comes back in the next book. After all it's the mystery that is what brought me to these books and well maybe the romantic life of Amelia."
4,Another good one for the series,I very much enjoy this series. Nice twists and surprises in this one! The give and take between characters oftens makes me laugh out loud - love it
3,"Nefret, stop acting like a twit!","I'll be blunt--I practically worship at MPM's feet, but the ongoing saga of Nefret/Ramses is ruining this series. These star crossed 'lovers' are so distracting it's hard to focus on the mystery and on Egyptology. Let's face it, we all KNOW, even before we start to read the book, who the bad guy will turn out to be. In this sense, the review, at the top of this page, definately ruins the mystery (I won't provide any more details since some of you may NOT know).The book is definately a must read for MPM fans and for anyone interested in Egyptology. It is always a joy to catch up on the activities of Amelia and Emerson, even if they ARE becomming seconday characters, and the addition of Sennia to the list of ongoing characters (at least I hope she will appear in future books) is a great one. I love Horus' reaction to her.All in all, a good read, except for Nefret acting like a twit."
5,All I can say is WOW!,"You can certainly understand why Ms. Peters is a ""Grand Master"" in mystery circles. With this latest Amelia, THE FALCON AT THE PORTAL, she's outdone herself with both plot twists and character insight - it's continuous action from first page to last, with the people so real they practically pop off the page. There's theft, there's murder, there's mayhem, there's romance . . . and just about anything else you can think of, all happening at once.Be ready to shut yourself away for a day, because you won't be able to put it down. But I warn unsuspecting readers, this book is full of emotional upheaval and doesn't tie everything up in a neat little bow at the end. If you're looking for pat fiary tale conclusions, you won't get them.Bravo! Ms. Peters. NOW, WHERE'S THE NEXT ONE?!!!!"
2,Blindsided by the depressing ending,"I expect some seriousness, even tragic events, from Elizabeth Peters, but I *also* expect a happy ending. I was, instead, deeply depressed by the ending. I read this book immediately after reading ""The Ape Who Guards the Balance"" because I couldn't wait to find out what would happen between Ramses & Nefret. I was not at all pleased by the turn of events!"
3,Great book - disappointing audio book,"This is one of my favorite books in the ""Amelia Peabody"" series, but this abridged version cuts out most of the romance, and all of the humor. Samantha Eggar does a great job bringing each character to life. The vocal portrayal is excellent. You can tell just from her voice, much about each character. And you have to; much of the text pertaining to character development has been left out. In shortening the story for the audio version, the quirky things I treasure about Peabody, and Emerson and especially Rames have been cut out. Secondary characters like Lia and Katherine pop in briefly, and only confuse the narrative. This leaves a bare and somewhat disjointed plot."
3,disappointed,"I bought this book as soon as it was available because I love the Amelia Peabody mysteries. Unfortunately, this quickly became my least favorite. It felt more like a soap opera than a mystery. Also, some of the characters seemed to act in ways that were not in their makeup and it felt forced. While it is certainly Ms. Peters' perogative to have her characters act in any way, I was disappointed. I'm hoping for a better one next time!"
5,An old friend,"I'm a long-time fan of Peabody, Emerson (wow to have a man like that), Ramses (ah Ramses!) and Nefret and was thrilled when I got to the book where they are finally together. I can hardly wait until the two or three books not yet on Kindle are entered. The books are not the kind of mystery that Agatha Christie served her fans. Rather, they are the kind of light reading that keeps one interested in the characters themselves, which Peters does with a deft hand without any gratuitous sex; Peters implies, not describes. The mysteries are easily solvable but I don't try to solve them, I just read them for the pleasure they give me. But yes, I also enjoy Follett!"
4,Family Takes Center Stage,"Elizabeth Peters has a strong wrap up to make THE FALCON AT THE PORTAL a satisfying mystery, but this is a novel about the family and how various relationships evolve. Well maybe, with Peters one never knows which is what keeps us reading, there are enough loose threads to bring us back for more.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
5,The best Amelia Peabody book yet,"In Falcon at the Portal, Elizabeth Peters goes far more deeply than ever before into the emotional lives of all of her characters. From the lovely evocative dreams that Amelia has of Abdullah, to the sheer passion that possesses Ramses, Peters lets us see and feel with her characters more surely than ever before, while not losing a jot of the usual madness that surrounds the Emersons every season - forged antiquities, doubts being cast on family members, and more than a few completely unexpected plot twists, turns and in fact revolutions! Brilliant writing, great fun, and deeper (and, yes, darker) than most of the series, this is a *terrific* book, and I await the next in happy anticipation. Peters is a splendid writer, long may she wave!"
4,"Ramses, marry me!","Seriously, I adore Ramses. This is a decent addition to the series, but not the best. If you can't stand cliffhanger endings, wait until the next one comes out before reading ""The Falcon at the Portal."" It might as well be called ""What Nefret Did."" Up to now it's been clear that she is impetuous, but never stupid. I don't know what to think about her anymore. Amelia was less than her usual terrifyingly astute self. I did like seeing David happy with Lia, but-- come on Ms. Peters, did Ramses deserve what he got? Sennia's a fabulous addition, and I can't wait to see what she becomes.I borrowed this from the library, finished it at 2 A.M., and couldn't sleep the whole night. Really, the ending can be fatal to avid readers of this series. Be warned."
5,I Have Never Been So Disappointed By A Book.,"I felt betrayed by my favorite author when I picked up this book. Instead of humor and whimsy, there was melodrama and tragedy. Yuck! It was like getting a kick in the stomach! I won't get the next book until I check it out thoroughly. I have read all of the Barbara Michaels/Elizabeth Peters books, and I must say, I intensely dislike this one and hope it's an isolated example. I have never been so disappointed by a book!"
3,Movie of the week!,"I couldn't wait to read this book. I was certain that the romance between Ramses and Nefret would be put to rest one way or the other. Instead, I am more frustrated than ever. Why oh why was Nefret's character turned into the simplest and weakest of silly young women. For her to run away like she did and then to marry Geoffrey was unbelievable. Why all the tragedy? Why still the premonition of more heartbreak to come? Why was Nefret's character destroyed? Too many questions are left unanswered. Bridge novel or not, the readers are left unfairly hanging. Instead of the book reading like the familiar Peabody novel it read like a movie of the week book. I was for the most part dissapointed."
3,heartbreaking disappointment,"I have LOVED the Amelia books and have been a loyal Elizabeth Peters fan ever since I read Crocodile on the Sandbank. Falcon at the Portal was a big disappointment as it did not have the same flow and flavor of earlier works, lacked the same crisp wit and the way she turned Nefret into an insipid character with bad judgment was not worthy of how she allowed Ramses to develop. One thing I've always liked about the Peabody books was being able to read and reread them to relive the story. With Falcon, I stop shortly after page 216. Although I look forward to having this resolved in the next book, I will be holding off reading it until I am assured of a better ending!"
1,Bitter disappointment,"I know that there is no guarantee of a happy ending in real life. However, I had been lulled into expecting a happy ending in Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody series (at least for the main characters). Wrong again. What was even worse, was that the behavior that brought about the unhappiness was completely contradictory to all previous character development. (I'm not being specific so as not to give away the story.) I was bitterly disappointed in this installment.On the positive side, I get the impression that the author may be planning a spin off series with Ramses as the lead. An undercover agent of the police force?"
2,Already read it.,"This was a book I read years ago, but it was presented as new. I was very disappointed"
4,This book is not complete.,"I finished this book this morning and I have been feeling frustrated about it all day. I love the Emersons and I have read all of Elizabeth Peters' books, but this one is only one-half a book. So much of the story is left unresolved that I wish I had waited until the next book came out to read this one. I would have saved money as well by buying a paperback. I know all the Emerson family stories continue, but this one was truly only part of a book. I enjoyed it, but I feel irritated with the author for leaving her loyal fans hanging to this degree."
1,Disappointed,I have never liked the character of Nefret. I wish it had never been introduced to the Peabody series. I hope the future books are better than this one.
3,no! no! no!,"I'm a long time reader of Peters/Michaels. But I have to agree with the reader of Oct. 13. I was so mad at the ending that I actually threw my signed copy against the wall (and went around screaming no, no, no). There was no reason to ruin these characters in such a way. Never having been a great fan of Ramses to begin with, I would really like to see Ms. Peters return to one of her other character series (Jacquelyn, Vicky) for a book or two and then straighten the Emersons out."
3,"why didn't it all end out happily, this is getting tiring.",Nefret is such a silly goose. Why did she go off and get married? I think Elizabeth Peters should show more of her feelings about things. I liked how she showed some of her feelings but I want more of them shown. She better hurry up and write that new book I can't kept waiting in supense any longer. Also I think she should wrap everything up in her next one or two books.
1,reader beware!,"Elizabeth Peters is my long-time favorite author. I have read this particular book, Falcon at the Portal, in hardcover several times, and loved it. It is one of my favorites. This is the first time I read it in e-book form. Had I not first read it in print I would have had difficulty with the text. There are so many transcription errors, typographical errors, missing phrases, misplaced and missing punctuation. The transcription appears to have been done with no proofing whatsoever. The name 'Selim' regularly appears as 'Scum' (!), 'r n' appears as 'm', and the like, to say nothing of phrases missing altogether.Peters is the BEST - but do not buy this ebook unless the errors are corrected. I am sending a letter to the publisher to that effect. To be fair, this is the only Amelia Peabody ebook so far to be so terribly full of errors. The rest look good."
4,Long time reader not judging......yet,"Both my mother and I have read about Amelia's adventures since the very beginning. When reading this book during vacation last summer(each installment marks the true beginning of summer for us), we were both surprised and slightly disappointed at the turn of events, especially those concerning Nefret. As such a strong-willed young woman, it was quite shocking to see her seemingly fall apart at the seams and become weak...After re-reading the book, however, we both decided that Elizabeth Peters was not ""copping out"" to a soap opera format as some readers feel...rather, she was giving us yet another of her twists that usually occur within one story. This time she's just letting it go to the next installment.True die-hard fans of Amelia Peabody and her family will reserve judgment until the next book...happily, we will not have to wait much longer :-)"
2,A real disappointment,"Up until now I have loved every one of the Amelia Peabody mysteries. They were clever, funny and upbeat, more comedic than dramatic. I found that the first half of this book was true to form but once Ramses and Nefret finally understood each other it took a definite turn for the worse. What I expected to be a light hearted book turned into a tragic, unbelievable drama. Nefret behaved completely out of the character that had previously been developed for her. I was very disappointed that a series I have always enjoyed reading for escapism should take such a harsh turn to reality. If I want to read about lovers separated by misunderstanding I will read biographies! I won't read another one in this series until and unless Elizabeth Peters returns this series to its roots."
3,The book was a little disappoting I wish it ended happier.,"I am a lover of the Amelia Peabody series. However I found this last book disapointing not only because The ending was not what I wanted. I think they we the readers need to hear Neferet's point of view as while as David and Lei. If we knew that it would be much better. On the plus side I can't wait for her next book to come out. I hope she picks the story up in switzerland, and that she keeps the faimly together."
2,A change is needed in the format of the Amelia Peabody books,"I have loved Amelia and her parasol from the first book in the series, Crocodile on the Sandbank. However, the latest entry falls curiously flat. All the familiar characters are present -- Emerson, Selim, Nefret, Ramses, David, etc. And there's an Egyptian mystery to be solved. But it never works the way it should. Changing from Peabody's first person to Manuscript H to Nefret's letters becomes tiresome. If Ramses and Nefret are to carry the series, let them tell the whole story, and allow Peabody to sit back. Or just let Peabody and her parasol take charge the way they should. I'm looking forward to the next book because there were too many loose ends in this one. And I hope the next installment returns to the quality of the earlier books."
3,Disappointing,"I must admit that I have not read as many of the Amelia Peobody Mystery's as others, but I was very disappointed in the way this book moved along. I found it hard to discern the direction this book was taking as well as what the mystery was. I was disappointed in the ending and kind of sickened by it. Not that I don't think I have figured out what happened, but that was the only interesting part of this book. I was very disappointed to see that there were no happy endings. I hope her next book is much better...."
2,Wish I'd Waited for the Paperback!,"In her most recent Amelia Peabody books, including this one, the author has used an annoying literary device of breaking the momentum of the narrative to insert ""Manuscript"" and diary segments from other characters. Why she doesn't just spin the next generation of characters into another series, instead of diluting the otherwise still-alluring plot and setting, is a mystery. I bought this book, as all the others, in hardback. The next book will either be borrowed from a library or purchased at a paperback exchange, and my money will go for another more deserving new mystery writer."
5,"Surprising plot twists, and very, very funny.","After 9 books in the series, I was worried this one might not live up to my expectations. But it is one of the best, with the usual cast of characters, and with my all time favorite, Ramses, in a starring role. Amelia is in fine forms, and as Emerson says, ""People frequently shoot at her."" I was very surprised by some of the plot twists, and now I have to wait for the next book to find out what happens. Please write quickly, Ms. Peters."
4,Cliffhanger,"I liked this book because it finally exposes Ramses REAL feelings. It gives the family a chance to really support one another in a way they never have before. Having said that I don't think anyone should read this book without its companion,He Shall Thunder In The Sky. Trust me on this."
4,This book was SHOCKING,"I've always been a fan of Amelia Peabody, and I've been anxiously awaiting the next installment of the books. I've come to enjoy the Ramses/Nefret intrigue in the past several books, and I'm glad that it finally went somewhere. However, I was disappointed with how it ended. I don't like having to wait an entire year to see what is going to happen next. Ms. Peters should definitely make this her first and last cliff hanger."
3,"A to-be-continued, better to wait for the sequel before read",Very well written but unfortunately leaves to much un-resolved. Suggest waiting for this novels sequel before starting to read this one.
5,This suit turns heads,"Rating on style and appearance, this suit gets high marks. Yes, the fit is snug. I considered exchanging for a size up, the legs are tight, but the total fit is good. The fabric is comfortable and the cut is retro and very sexy. People turn their heads and ask where I got this suit. Compare to theSpeedo Men's Poly Mesh Square Leg Bathing Suitwhich are laughable diapers or granny panties, the nylon stripe square leg suit is the clear winner."
2,Reason for return,We returned this item as the legs were so small. It was well made but the banding around the legs were to tight and small. If you order this order a size larger.
4,Still testing...,"Firstly, buy a size 2+ than your actual waist size. I got a 36 for my 34 inch waist, and it fits just right.Very lightweight and comfortable. In fact, I am tad afraid that it might tear at any moment. But the fabric seems durable. Have used it a couple of times and it retains the color."
5,I Love This Suit!,"I am learning to swim, and this suit is perfect. It's not too tight or showy, but is compact enough to let me move freely. This suit is so light, it's like wearing nothing so to I can focus more on swimming. It's not cut to accentuate guy junk, so I'm not self conscious in or out of the pool. I tried about 5 similar suits of all brands and so far this is the best suit. It's also the least expensive. I've only clocked about 12 hours in the pool so far, but there are no signs of wear. This suit is so great I'm buying a second, maybe even third, so that when this one wears out (all things wear out eventually) I won't have to waste a month trying out other suits if they stop making this one."
2,Does not fit well,The construction of the leg hole is sub standard. The edge is too thick and cuts into the thigh. Would not use it.
3,Fade to quickly,"My husband likes this style for his lap swimming. Speedo has changed the stock number, so it took a while to find the new number. Also, Speedo must have changed the dye process, because it starts to fade after one use in the pool. Current versions only last about two months at three times a week use."
1,Terrible fit,"The leg holes on these are ridiculously tight. I'm a fairly fit runner with not abnormally sized legs and these are so restrictive as to be painful. And they look like granny panties. Speedo used to make a square leg suit that fit well, but they must have discontinued it.Really, unless you are emaciated, your legs will not fit in the leg holes."
4,They don't fade in saltwater,"I have had several polyester Speedos over the years, including this one, as well as the TYR version. These suits only fade quickly if you are swimming in a chlorinated pool. I have one that I used 2-5 times per week when I swam in the Pacific, and only after several years did it show noticeable fading, primarily from hanging dry in the sun. Chlorine is bleach, and the amount in a pool is somewhat dilute, but upon repeated soakings, it will strip the pigment out of almost anything.If you are looking for a slightly more modest speedo (oxymoron, I know) than a racer cut suit, this is the ticket. The legs will fit tightly, but that's an important feature so your business doesn't go on full display when you are sitting down in one.For openwater where you are going to be out for an hour or more, I prefer the more generous cut, and the absence of Lycra cinching everything against your body. That's fine for pool races, but not comfortable after a while at sea."
1,Buy the Blue,"Just sent the black model of this suit back. The dye is not set and will wash out every time it gets wet. This suit fits well but not made for the water. Buy the navy one, no problems with it yet. After 3 months it turned brown. Have not found a speedo that is color fast in water!"
4,Color fades quickly,"I would like to confirm the previous reviewer's comment that the color on this suit (Navy Blue) faded very quickly. In addition I also found that the shape gets stretched and baggy fairly quickly, in spite of rinsing with fresh water after every chlorine exposure. In general, this doesn't seem up to Speedo's usual quality, but for the price ($17) it's a good deal."
3,Speedo swimwear review,"Light, and quick drying this is a decent suit for a casual swim. One caution is that it lacks ample room for those with bigger, beefy thighs, thus the first time I wore them I felt tightness and left ""redlined."""
2,Great for grandma...,"Bad cut - at least for my body type. Very high-riding. Came up almost to my navel! Nice try tough, with the sqaure-ish cut and stripes. Looked promising. Legs are, indeed, tight as many reviewers point out. But the waist was maybe just a touch small to size. Sent back."
2,Made for a skinny euro-guy,"I wear 32-34, but the medium size almost suffocated my thighs! I had to return these. I noticed the Gary Majdell shorts have a better style, so I re-ordered those instead."
3,"Okay Suit, bad service","The suit is okay - it's tighter in the legs than I expected and rides up further than I thought it would, but it is comfortable and was pretty cheap. However, getting it was a fiasco with Amazon and UPS both giving me the run around - finally it arrived 10 days after I ordered it with 2 day shipping.-david"
1,poor Material,"This swim suit was navy blue, just a couple times in the pool and the color started to turn brown! The piping sewn around the leg holes stayed blue but not the rest of the suit. I have suits from other manufacturers used in the same pool with no color shifts. I am very disappointed with this item especially from a company that is suppose to be top of the line. Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,So Far So Good,"Comfortable, sporty... everything is great. If they stand the test of time I will give them 5 stars!"
5,Great swimsuit for the money.,Bought these to be a drag suit for training. I swim on a college swim team and these will work fine for my needs. Can't go wrong with Speedo products.
5,Outstanding and Inspirational,I have almost all of Kathy's music and I really enjoy this one. She inspires your walk with the Lord no matter what you're going through. Thanks Kathy!
5,Nice to have this album again,"Many years ago I purchase this on CASSETTE (thats what was in most cars). I played it almost everytime I was in the car. I lost it when my car caught on fire, I lost all my favorite music that I was listening to at that time, some that I can never replace. I've often missed hearing this album and I am very glad to now have it in my collection again. The songs are saying the words my heart speaks and I am enjoying it tremendously. I ordered on Friday night and received on Tuesday morning."
5,NO LONGER AVAILABLE,I orderd this guide two weeks ago only to be advised that it is NO LONGER Available. Seems to me they ought remove it from their list.
1,Sent to the printer too early!,"The tactical information was somewhat helpful, but the unit stats had so many typos and was so poorly organized, I can't rely on the information to be helpful. I don't think they editors reviewed this with the game publishers before this was sent to the printer. Not worth the money!"
1,Not helpful at ALL!,Worst Latin purchase I have ever made! These tapes were not in the least bit helpful and seemed to drag on and on.
1,Don't have your heart set on color shown,"I ordered a BLACK challenger concept car for my husband for Christmas. This was the color of the car featured on Amazon. What I received was an orange car. I contacted the company to complain. And, while PIMA did contact me back and was very nice, they said they had no control over what is sent from the manufacturer. So, basically, I wanted a black car. It was shown as a black car, but you are sent whatever color the manufacturer wants to send. That is not good customer service and I will not be ordering from them again."
4,Nice Scale model however...,"This is a nicely done scale model of the new Dodge Challenger concept. The paint and interior are done very well. However the doors open a little funky and don't close exactly right, but after a slight push they close correctly. The engine compartment leaves a little to be desired by the detail oriented collectors but the outside of the car is awesome. The wheels are especially cool and well done."
1,sent wrong color,"I wanted a ""Black SRT8"" and I received a ""RED prototype"".This was to be a gift for an owner of a real one and now it will be too late.I am not happy."
5,Excelent Excelent Excelent,This is the first album this band put out. It is Excelent. As are all their albums. I give this masterpiece 10 or more stars. I urge all to listen to it. AFOS PLAY HAPPY MUSIC.
3,"Solid, but not remastered, for whatever reason.","Funny how things get done, or not. It is surprising to me that this of all their releases has not been remastered. This must be the music industry getting in it's own way. I have found that sound quality can be improved by a great margin, yet the industry as a whole is satisfied to produce marginal quality products. Let's get with it and reissue this one remastered, ASAP!"
4,more than just Nostalgia,"This is a great album. Trust me. And what no one seems to remember is that these guys are Grammy Winners - yes, GRAMMY WINNERS - for Best Instrumental of the Year for the fantastic D.N.A. from this, their debut album. This is a classic example of a band whose image was so strong ( who can forget THAT HAIR !! ) that it often overshadowed their talent ( another fine example is Culture Club ). Unfortunately, it was all downhill from here, as their popularity ( not to mention their creativity and their stability ) quickly waned. Very upbeat, energetic dance pop-rock, with just enough synths and effects to make it stand out in the crowd. My advice : skip the many ""best of"" compilations and go straight to this one. And when you get ridiculed for playing it, just like you did in high school ( you know who you are... ) do the Flock proud and wear that freak badge with honor."
4,good but...,"On second thought I would have rather of bought the best of flock of seagulls. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good album but I would rather enjoy a collection of their music. I miss not having ""Nightmares""."
4,Who is Goha?,"These short stories are all about the trickster/wiseman/fool called Goha in Egypt, but known by other names across the Arabian peninsula, Iraq and Iran. These ancient stories, set with modern illustrations are delightful to read and fun to tell. They are enjoyable to adults, and they even set small children giggling. This book is part of series of children's titles about life in Egypt, and manages to capture Goha's spirit."
2,Not Believable,"I'm afraid that I was disappointed by this 1936 movie of French gangsters in the Casbah. I suppose this was a copy of American gangster movies, but Jean Gabin as a suddenly love sick hard guy willing to risk prison for a pretty face is not believable. In fact, none of the characters seemed realistic. They were almost cartoonish. Humphrey Bogart or James Cagney in their 1930's gangster movies were far more realistic and their films hold up better. Because Gabin's love for Juline Duvivier is not developed, we can not understand why Pepe would give up the sexy life he has in his exotic world. The best part of the movie is Pepe's walk to the harbor. The camera follows him from behind and from unusual angles and cuts. There is a Citizen Kane feeling in these shots. The gritty tear scene at the end is interesting also. Technically this movie is not up to American Gangster movies, but you can see the influence on Godard in the 50's."
1,"Le Pew, I Agree.","One reviewer claimed this higly overrated film was the inspiration for Pepe Le Pew, the Looney Tunes cartoon character. I don't know if there is any truth to his claim, but I would say the Le Pew association works on another level: This film stinks! I hate everything about it, including its overdone art design, its terrible (and way too melodramatic) acting, its dreadful pacing and its derivative storyline. Don't waste your time."
3,Whetting my appetite,This is the first Sackville-West that I've read and I think that it's unfortunate that I began with her last book. It tells the story of a journalist who discovers he only has a short time to live and decides to take a sea voyage in the company of a widow. The book felt rushed and a little slight-- one can't help but think about the fact that Sackville-West died the year following publication-- but there were so many good things in it that I will be going back to pick up an earlier work.
5,[ Perfect Case ],"I don't even OWN a Canon camera. I have a Casio Exilim camera, and I bought this case because it was exactly what I was looking for. So for all you Casio Exilim owners out there, this is a good buy for you too."
5,Great case!,"I just got the RED case today, and my only (minor) complaint is that the red colour is not nearly as vibrant as it is in the photo. It's a very nice red, but not the same as the photo. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the case."
5,LOVE IT!!,I absolutely love this camera case. The color is beautiful and it fits my Canon SD630 perfectly!! It was a bit snug at first but ended up being perfect. I ordered another one as a gift for my friend who has the exact same camera. I know he will love it just like I did. And you can't beat the price! Amazing!
5,Perfect fit for SD600 (too small for SD700IS,"I just purchased both the Canon SD600 and SD700IS cameras (one for me, one as a gift). There are two similar cases - the PSC-90 and the PSC-55. The SD600 camera, which is a bit smaller than the SD700IS in all 3 dimensions, fits perfectly and rather snugly in the smaller PSC-90 case. The larger PSC-55 case is a bit longer than the SD700IS. You can actually fit the older S400 camera into the PSC-55 case. In fact the PSC-55 is a perfect case for the S400 - again very snug. So, it seems that Canon doesn't make a snug fitting case for the SD700IS.Overall the case is very well made and differs from some earlier Canon cases in that the sides are all rather stiff thereby protecting the camera from being banged around in a purse, backpack, etc. The only minor downside is that the case does therefore add a bit of thickness to these cameras thereby making them a bit on the bulky side for a jeans pocket, etc. However they are still ""pocketable""."
4,Does the job decently,"I have an SD600 and it seems to protect it somewhat snugly. Because it is meant to fit cases slightly thicker than the 600, I do have a little room, and I put my spare SD card in there so I don't move around as much. The case is overall a good case, but starts to crease up after about a month, which isn't that bad for leather. Of course because it's leather, you can't really use this in the rain, not that you'd have your camera out in the rain, but I thought it'd be good to let you know. The strap feels pretty secure, and is good as a spare in case the one that came with my camera breaks. It closes pretty securely and I have confidence that if I drop it, my camera will be safe, but I think some kind of adjustable strap to tighten it for the smaller-cased cameras would have been a smart decision, since a stretched case would defeat the purpose of the ridged sides."
5,High Quality Camera Case,Fit snugly. Beautiful & high quality case. Much better than those generic faux leather found at dept store.
4,Too tight for SD800 IS,"The dimension of this case is 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 inches; the dimension of the Canon SD800 IS is 3.5 x 2.3 x 1.0 inches, but it wouldn't fit unless is squeeze it in! And after I squeezed the camera in, the magnet won't close because the camera is a little longer than the case. So I just keep squeezing and finally got it to ""click"". Now I am leaving the camera in the case to strech it. :PI love the case thou. The color is beautiful. :D That's why I am going through the trouble to keep the case. :DHope this is helpful."
2,Had to stretch out the case,"This case is a tight fit on my sd600. I put a PDA screen protector over the LCD screen of the sd600, and the case was so tight that it eventually peeled off the edge of the screen protector after the third use. I eventually solved the problem by leaving the handle of a fat screwdriver in the case overnight. The next day the case was stretched out enough so that there was some leeway between the case and the camera. Now it works fine. The case NOT soft leather. It is somewhat sturdy and firm--good protection against soft knocks."
3,no pocket for spare battery,"The quality of the case is very nice. The camera fit is quite snug. There is no place to fit a spare battery, which seems kind of silly. The case will protect the camera LCD screen from scratches."
5,Canon Leather Case,"This case is fabulous. The magnetic snap is very powerful, it's sleek, like the camera and sturdy."
4,Too Cute!,"""Too cute,"" is what everyone always says when they see my SD 450 tucked into this red leather case. It is a perfect fit for the camera, though there is no room for an extra battery or card. But since this is a tiny camera that I use for on-the-go shooting, I really don't need to carry these extras.I also love the matching wrist strap that comes with it. Our camera looks very unique (I can always tell which is mine when sitting on a table with other's cameras at parties), and the wrist strap is a must for safety. I give the case and strap a 4 of 5 rating only because I'm not crazy about the way the strap feeds through the case. While I like that I get the use of a wrist strap when the camera is in the case, it is kind of annoying to feed and unfeed the strap when I'm trying to quickly access the camera. Overall, it's a small annoyance, but does keep this case from ultimate perfection."
5,Great compact case,"I'm a girl. A girly girl with a small purse who travels a LOT. I don't like big bags but must always have my phone, camera, keys, and lipstick wherever I go. Therefore, things are prone to being scratched getting into my purse. This case is stylish,practical, and a great shade of red. My camera fits PERFECTLY and is very safe from scratches while in my purse. The compact size of the camera and case without any excess parts, compartments, etc., make them ideal for me. This case is absolutely perfect for my SD600. I didn't like the wrist strap that came with the case; I just use the one that came w/ the camera. The case closes just fine without my having to loop it through the hole in the case. I can easily keep the case in my jacket pocket and go if I don't want to carry a purse. I highly recommend this to anyone who is getting either a Canon SD450 or SD600. The quality of leather is quite superb as well, resisting getting scratched itself quite nicely."
3,Good Protection,"This is a classy case, and considering the protection isn't too bulky. It's very easy to hang from the wrist as well. I bought this for my new SD630 (not on the supported list of products), and the fit was so tight that the case wouldn't close unless the lanyard was fed through the hole at the top of the case. This is rather inconvenient for taking the camera in and out of the case. I nearly dropped my camer a couple of times and ended up losing the case after a couple of days. I would definitely buy another for a slightly smaller camera though."
3,Alternative Idea for a PowerShot Case,"I just got an SD-400 and love it so far. I have been searching for a suitable case for it, but haven't found anything I like. However, I just discovered that the iPod holster I never use with my iPod fits this camera very well. If you are just looking for something to protect the camera's finish, give it a try and save your money."
1,Pay a bit more and get something good,This one is hard leather with sharp corners and does not feel comfortable in my pocket.
5,"Great fit and perfect, Good value too","This is a very nice case for Canons. It's all leather and has a magnetic latch. It holds and secure the camera snugly. The only thing is that it does not have any cushion for the camera, but hey, you want the camera to be compact right, even if it is in the case.Would definitely recommend it.(May be for a newer Canon camera model, another case is required because of shape and size)"
4,Nice camera case,"This is a good camera case, fits the Elph Powershot cameras to a ""T"" (both are manufactured by Canon, so not surprising). The leather holds up well, I have taken it lots of places and there are no scratches or signs of wear. The one issue I have with it is that it does not include a pocket for extra memory cards or batteries, and it's a pain to carry those separately without fear of losing them."
4,Compact,"One thing I worry about the most is the inside button, I always concern the steel part of inner side of the button could scratch the surface of the camera, although I don't see any yet, but, this part can be improved to ease people's minds. I still rate it 4"
3,Canon sd600 leather case,"Nice looking case. Camera fits in nicely and the belt loop is convenient. However, when you install the wrist strap on the camera, it becomes difficult to feed it throught the slot in the front flap of the case. The case will not snap shut if the strap is not fed through the slot. The case was worth the cost when included in a package price. The stand alone price of $xx is too high."
4,good quality,it's made by canon so it fit my sd600 perfectly. the leather is very sturdy and good quality. the inside is lined nicely so no scratches on my new camera! =)
5,fits the SD700,"since it is leather, you can put some pressure on the camera to push it in the case and it stretched perfectly in 1-2 days to allow the SD700 to fit and still snap the clasp. fits 'like a glove' which maintains the beauty of having a small camera yet still a case."
2,Tight fit,"Looks good, but barely fits the described cameras with no room for xtra memory cards. I had hoped to use w/Cannon SD700-Not a chance!"
4,Nice for carrying but inconvenient,The camera fits snuggly into this case and is great for carrying but you need to remove it from the case to take a picture. I found this inconvenient and tended to walk around with the camera in one pocket and the case in the other. I prefer to use adhesive clear plastic on the LCD screen and keep the camera in my pocket. You can get this from Staples or Best Buy.
5,Perfect case for a shirt pocket camera,If you like a camera that you can carry in your shirt pocket this is the case for you. Fitted to the camera perfectly and can still fit in a pocket without bulk. Made of leather it protects the camera and gives it a fine look. It has enough space to carry an extra SD card and can also be attached to a belt.
3,Looks Great!,"This case looks so good that I am completely in love with it. It fits my SD 600 well. The only problem is that when I open the flap to take out the camera, the camera rubs with the magnetic buckle on the cover which causes faint scratches on the body of the camera. So while opening I am getting used to opening the case and then folding the flap outwards that it doesnt scratch. Otherwise its vey good."
4,Nice sleek case (not very practical),"I really like the way this sleek leather case looks. However, I don't feel that there is enough padding to cushion the camera should it be dropped. It only has room for the camera; no extra batteries or memory cards, etc."
3,ok case not great,case is too stifflow quality leatheri wish it was smaller with better fitother than that is serves its purpose
5,Great service & product.,I received what I expected to receive...the product was in excellent shape.
4,Better case for SD600 -- PSC55 or PSC90?,"I'm shopping for a case for the Canon PowerShot SD600. From what I've read here, the PSC-90 is a great case for this camera. But Canon also has a soft leather case, the PSC-55, which might be as good or better. Has anyone compared the two? I'd be interested in seeing any comments pro or con."
2,Too bulky,The advantage of buying a great small photo camera is spoiled by the size of this case. I didn't like the leather also.
1,The case is crap,I was expecting to get a case similar to the one I got for my SD110 which was quite nice. This case is cheap cheap cheap - Made in China crap. The leather is one step above plastic. The snap to close it scratches the camera. This is not worth it. I am so disappointed. It spoilt the enjoyment of getting my new SD300.
5,Very attractive and functional,"This is the perfect case for my 600. It fits perfectly, is very slick (I think the red leather is largely responsible for that),and it is rigid enough that I know my camera is protected. It is worth every penny I paid for it."
3,Does not fit my SD630,"The description of this camera says it fits the SD600 so I assumed it will also fit my SD630 since the difference between the SD600 and SD630 is only in the LCD screen size. Also I read some reviews where someone say it fit their SD630 perfectly.Well, it DOES NOT!!! The flap cannot close. THe camera body sticks out of the camera bag and prevents the button from closing. I pulled really hard hoping the button will snap in but it won't. I hope I can return this."
3,Close but no cigar,"I looked at this case for my new Canon SD400. Three major problems with the three Canon cases I looked at (Coach, PSC50, PSC90):1) They attach to your belt with the camera vertical. A horizontal mount is much less intrusive.2) No room for an extra battery. With no battery life indication on this Canon model I want an extra battery with the camera always.3) They either are very expensive looking (Coach) or have a metal Canon logo on the front. This is a big sign that says steal me! The metal logo tag is also prone to scratch things.My previous camera and case was the Canon S330 and the soft case made for it. It had a perfect size pouch for a spare battery and I removed the metal Canon logo. Alas it is no longer available.I bought the Pentax PTX-L40 for my new Canon SD400. It is a perfect fit in all ways. The embossed Pentax logo is subtle."
3,The Right-Size Camera Case,"What I like most about the case is that it's small, compact, and not as bulky as some Sony and third-party alternatives. The leather looks nice, but a higher quality leather (softer, on the surface) would be much better.What makes me concern is that the flap button of the case could easily scratch the LCD screen, if you're not careful while pulling the camera out. That's why I give it 3 stars instead of 5.Overall, a nice concept, but the rather mediocre design and the serious flap button flaw make me not completely happy for having purchased this item."
4,Does not fit SD-630,"In case if someone is bying this case for SD-630, it does NOT fit the camera.SD-630 is few millimiters longer than other SD cameras may be because of its 3"" LD screen, so case would not close with camera in it. I tried my older SD-300 camera and it fits perfectly."
3,need room for a spare battery,"Several reviewers don't think it's necessary to have a spare battery because it defeats the purpose of having a compact camera. I don't suppose any of them have taken their kids to Disney World for the day and 'hope' their one battery will last as long as the many photo opps do. Especially considering Canon does not let you know when you are low on battery power and you don't have the choice of popping into a store to purchase an over-the-counter battery when you run out. Buy a really big memory card and you don't have to worry about space, but there isn't anything you can do about a battery running out of juice - even when you start the day fully charged. Yes, you can carry a spare battery in some other 'bag', but I personally like to keep them together for a lot of reasons. The batteries are fairly small - it would be pretty easy to make room for a spare in the case."
5,VERY NICE,"This Red Deluxe Leather case fits my SD600 camera quite well. However it has a metal magnetic clasp which my camera sometimes gets stuck to when taking it out of its case. I wonder if this magnetism has any bad effects to the camera. Anyways, the case is very nice."
2,Departure,"I bought this EP expecting more of the usual brutal, grinding Entombed that I know and love. Unfortunately this was a marked departure from their typical material. I really didn't like it."
3,Longgggg Delivery,The kit is good and everything you need is in the package so I do recommend the product itself. The problem was that I placed my order on December 26th and the expected shipping was 2 days later but it didn't actually get shipped for 2 more weeks. I was calling Electronic Express and the people I talked to gave me inconsistent answers to the question of where my package was and when it would ship. One girl that worked there told me that it would ship on Tuesday but it didn't ship until the next Friday. I got the shipment on January 10 so thats 15 days wait. I don't know if this is a usually occurance but for the record I recommend the product just try to get it from a different store.
4,4/5 Great Overall,"I have a 2000 Ford Taurus SE. Firstly, I would only recommend you purchase this kit if the year of your car is 2000-2003 (as stated on the box.) The kit comes with everything you would need, the only drawback; however, is that the directions could be more detailed as far as wiring goes. The diagrams could also be better drawn, but what can you do. I had to take this into Best Buy, because I just couldn't figure out how to wire the darned thing. Although, if wiring is your thing, this will be no problem whatsoever for you. I would also recommend you pickup a ""din"" removal tool, which will save you a boatload of hassle. Overall, the thing looks great, works great, and I would highly recommend this to anyone who was interested."
2,Rather disappointing,"I bought this item instead of a competitors less expensive model due to the reports I read concerning the matching of the coloring. Also, the manufacturer claims that their wiring is superior and stays connected. I had the power lead pull out during the initial install, another came loose 6 months later and the rear window defroster still isn't wired since three of the four wires were off in the packaging when received. I emailed the manufacturer who said they had no diagram and were unable to assist me in getting them on the correct pins. I would have been better off paying less for the competition and taking a chance on the coloring and texture matching."
4,dash kit,This dash kit is a great affordable replacement for the factory plate. The instructions could be a little more clear but you can figure it out if you think about it a little.
4,Pretty good harness,"The Metra mirror the Taurus is a pretty good purchase. You'll need one anyway. Be careful when installing it, the plastic pins that hold it in and the Ford tension clips are easy to break. I wish that the harness had the same texture as the corresponding dash pieces."
1,MILE LONG WIRES,NO instructions mile long wires I put a deck in my 2008 ford fusion in 2 seconds.. This looks messed the messed up.
3,kind of disappointed...,I enjoy the fact that I know have an aftermarket radio in my 02 taurus but a little disappointed because of how much a pain the wire harness was...it was way too long for my needs so I ended up trimming at least 3 feet of it off.the new head unit has a gap around it which im going to eventually fill with rubber stripping because i was unable to use the metra mounting system.
5,better than scotche,worth paying extra for this dash kit. well made and the quality is deffinetly better that the scotche dash kit i bought.
4,END OF EVOLUTION MASS EXTINICT & BIODIVERSITY,"END OF EVOLUTION MASS EXTINICT & BIODIVERSITY by WARD,PETER is a brilliant look into the history of planet Earth and the life that once inhibited this planet. Throughout the history mass extinctions have occured resulting in the destruction of old world also resulting in the evolution of a new world. Throughout the book Dr. Ward describes these mass extinctions and warns of another mass extinction that may take place if Human Beings are not careful. I strongly advice anyone who is remotely interested in Geology or in any sciences to read this book!"
3,This isn't it.,"I was looking for Benny's very last recording session from 1986, unfortunately titled ""Let's Dance"" as are 5-6 other Goodman albums. This one has some good music--a mix of big band and small group numbers--but it's on the frequently atrocious LaserLight label, which provides little to no documentation and doesn't bother with things like mastering (I've had to throw some of the albums away because of distortion rendering them unlistenable). Some are studio recordings, and others are on-location, with certain instruments far enough from the mic to suggest an amateur recording.I'd guess the date to be the 1960s given the presence of musicians like Doc Severinsen, Jimy Knepper, Zoot Sims, Phil Woods in the large ensemble. More interesting are the quartet numbers--Benny recorded live with a rhythm section of Dick Shreve (new to me), Monty Budwig and Colin Bailey. ""You're Blase"" features a touching, introspective Goodman, and on ""For the Sunrise"" Benny blows his tail off."
5,FABULOUS,THERE IS NO BETTER BOOK. IT SHOULD BE ON EVERY TABLE.TOMMY SIMPSON'S WORK IS UNSURPASSED. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS BOOK WELL IT'S YOUR LOSS
2,Not what I expected,"I bought 'Common Creed' after listening to 'Inventions' by Wes King, Scott Dente, and Phil Keaggy. I was expecting to hear Wes showcase his considerable guitar skills and some more of the diverse styles I heard on 'Invention.""Unfortunately the album was all vocal tracks, very pop oriented, and way too perky and one-dimensional for me. The music reminded me of Richard Marx from the eighties without the catchy melodies, as I think too much CCM stuff does. The lyrics were too bland. Nothing challenging or thought-provoking. I gave the album to my friend's mom a few days after I bought it.I loved 'Invention' but Wes King's solo work, at least this album, is not in the same league. I wish I could find more Christian music that didn't sound so much Christian music is ""supposed to sound.""Fans of CCM radio and specifcally Michael W. Smith should probably disregard my review. People looking for Christian music with more grit might want to look into Phil Keaggy or Glass Harp."
1,Not worth $111.00,"This book was highly recommended on a blog I follow. I was surprised to see that it costs $111 when it retails in Canada for $35, so I was excited when I found a copy at a used book store. Flipping through, I found only one recipe I would consider trying.The chapters are short with very few true low carb recipes. Mostly fruits, desserts, a few vegetable dishes and maybe a dozen pages of beef, pork and poultry. And far too much use of splenda. Many recipes come straight from a newer version of Atkins, where cottage cheese and tofu are fillers, fat is avoided and even savory dishes have a packet of artificial sweetener.Definitely not worth the $12.50 at the used store and I hope I have swayed you from paying almost ten times that price."
5,Very useful and packed with great info.,"Great book! Many thanks. Would highly recommend. Utilizing transcripts and narrative, Michael Yapko brings creativity and wisdom to process of working with depressed clients."
4,I love to cook--a good book,I really enjoy cooking (--a good book) so like to try new ways. This has a lot of good recipies but now my husband is diebetic so don't get a chance to use this book very much.
3,Alright,"Nice, solid remixes. Nothing great, nothing bad, like the album this single came from. Here's a breakdown:1) ""Radio Edit"" -- 20 seconds shorter than the album version.2) ""Mellow Mix"" -- Mellow is a pretty good description. It's rather soft and dreamy sounding, without the harder percussion of the original. I like this version a lot more than the album version. Q-Tip isn't in this mix, by the way.3) ""Nellee Hooper Master Mix"" -- A sorta dark, hip hop mix, heavy bass. Q-Tip is present in this version.4) ""Mellow Mix Edit"" -- Two minutes shorter than the Mellow Mix.5) ""Album Version"" -- Hmmm.And that's it. Nothing Earth-shattering, but, like I said, I really like the Mellow Mix. It's unfortunate this wasn't release State-side in any case."
4,Got 'Til It's Gone,"Tracks:1. Radio Edit (3:39)2. Mellow Mix (5:11)3. Nellee Hooper Master Mix (4:18)4. Mellow Mix Edit (3:51)5. Album Version (4:00)Tracks 1 and 5 are masterpieces, forces to be reckoned with!!! Tracks 2 and 4 are the best of the mixes here, they're slow and very sweet, and Q-Tip is not present in those. Track 3 has major bass damage, and isn't so good..."
5,Awesome Receiver,"Best Receiver I've owned to date. Those of you who think that this receiver does not have the Watts Needed to shake the house down, ""THINK AGAIN"". 100% PoWeRhOuSe!!!! I replaced a Pioneer Elite reciever 110 watts x5 and it never sounded as clear, loud, distortion free as the AVR-147. Great receiver for the small price. Dolby Digital is fantastic, as well as the other surround fields. Must Buy this product... EZsetUp.. sucks though but it's easy setting the speakers yourself. 5stars in my book.."
1,"Don't buy this, or from this vendor","I received my AVR147 in late August. I took about a week to get the components all set up. Then I tried to run the microphone auto setup, called EzEq. It did not work. Long story short: I called Harmon Kardan several times over the next three weeks to try to get it working, including some resets. In the end, HK concluded the unit is defective. I called ElectronicsExpo, but after several days of calls, including dropped calls and endless holds, I finally got through to a rep. He said they could not process a return because it was past thirty days. By all of 10 days! If I had not tried to work the problem out with HK, I could have returned the unit long ago.I was amazed they did not try to keep me happy. Yes, I am past thirty days, but the problem occurred within the thirty day window. Amazon should hold their vendors to a higher standard of customer service."
1,There are better products,"I've had this receiver for about 2 months now. It has been a disappointment. I would rather have my old Yamaha receiver. Here are some of the reasons:1) The unit emits a big scratching sound when you pause a DVD and then restart.2) The remote control can't turn on and off my Sharp TV. Also, the remote gets into weird modes where nothing works. I have to turn off the receiver and turn it back on.3) The surround-sound setup proceedure with the supplied microphone did not work when the microphone was where my head would be. I had to put the micrphone where my feet would be. Even then, the proceedure was very simplistic compared to the Yamaha tune-up proceedure.The unit sounds about the same as other receivers I have used. Others just work better."
4,Pretty darn good for the price,"With the high current amp the 40 watts per channel sound great at full throttle. Plenty loud for my purpose. The HDMI works very well in this model for video. You can input an HDMI signal and it will output that signal using any source (component in my case) you can also input any signal and output HDMI. Biggest drawback is that the HDMI does not carry audio. Another negative is that the on screen menu is only carried to the TV using s-video or composite. I like the Bridge i-pod adaptor and XM radio ability. I use the Bridge and it works pretty well. What I hate is the remote. I am already looking for a replacement. If on the remote you select to listen to the Bridge, you don't have volume control until to go back to AVR. It's the same with any device you select on the remote; you always have to go back to AVR to control the volume and then back to the device to control it again. For the price it's a good deal."
2,HARMON KARDON 147,"I'm still having problems using their EZ Set/EQ speaker set up. For something that is supposed to be easy, it isn't. My surround sound still doesn't seem right. If I had to do it over again, I would have kept my old Sony."
2,Terrible Product,Don't be fooled because it is made by PalmOne and made for the Treo 650. This product is terrible. You would think that it would be a great product since it comes from the manufacturer of the hardware that fits in it. This is not so. The camera is not revealed. You have to unsnap the top strap and fold down the back falp to use the Camera. You have to unsnap it whenever you need to to beam or receive a beam. Unsnapping it will eventually lead to you forgetting to snap it back and you will drop the Treo 650 sooner or later. The top right corner is not covered. If you drop it while it is in the case the corner is not protected. Krusell makes a better case than PalmOne.
2,AVOID if you want to wear this with the belt clip,"I've owned this case for about a year. I think it's an attractive case. However the snap that holds the Treo in the case is weak and has opened many times causing the Treo to fall out and land on the ground. In addition to dinging the Treo, this has led to styli falling out and occasionally getting lost.I do NOT recommend this case if you intend to wear your Treo using the belt clip because the snap is too weak. If you're keeping it in your purse or briefcase, it should be fine."
4,Great for falling asleep to,"This is great, light music with bird and nature sounds, that is relaxing when you are trying to go to sleep or want background noise in your car or office. The previous reviewer wants pure bird songs; he'll have to go to Audubon Society for that. This is just pleasant background music for a nature lover."
1,Hagiography,"This book is pure hagiography. Too uncritical to be of much value. Incidentally, passe what has been said elsewhere, the Nazis were not at all oppposed to the setting up of a jewish state in Palestine. On the contrary, it accorded with Nazi beliefs that Jews were ""foreigners"" in Germany and needed their ""own"" territory, being incompatible with any country they settled in. Although not true of Ben Gurion himself, many early Zionists were complicit with the Nazis."
1,Amazing.,"Completely manipulative, devious, dishonest drivel...Please look at the facts, side by side, while reading this book."
3,Good Book.,"Ben, Nattie, and Harrison tried to build a barn the biggest in Oregon Territory. All Of them tried hard and built it themselves. Ben was the one who always said we can't get eny help. The reason why they built it is beacuse the wanted to give it to there sick father. When there father saw the barn it made him well again."
1,The Barn,"My book""The Barn"" is about where the family of four,the boy Ben He is school and his brother and sister ,Nettie and Harrison they work at home. Nettie takes care of father.The father is very sick and dying. Harrion takes care of things outside.Their mom has died.The father worse so Nettie had to go get Ben to help around at the house.Ben thinks that father wants ben to build a barn.Even when things were getting worse Nettie brought home her boyfriend home and announced that they were getting married."
5,Barn Heart,"THE BARN is a quick read novel, set in Oregon in l855. It is the story of how the construction of a simple barn, a dying father's wish, transforms the lives and bonding between three children and their father. Harrison, Nettie, and Ben, each had a different reason for agreeing to build the barn. The vision of the barn, standing strong on their farm property, remained a source of strength, satisfaction, love, and family pride throughout their lifetime. It was a true family gift."
3,The Barn,"It's about a boy named Ben that lives on a farm, but he is at a privite school when his dad gets a disease. He has to go back to the farm and help his brother Harrison and his sister Nettie take care of their dad. Ben thinks that theres only one thing that will cure his dad's disease. If he does it he thinks it will help his dad regain health.My opinion about the book was I didn't like the book because it didn't explain about what is going on at his house or what is going on with his family. I liked it because it had a good story line and it had Ben trying and trying to helphis dad with his disease and he really believes that he can cure his dad."
4,Victory After College,"I read Christopher's Book after my sister gave it to me. (She is friends with him) However, instead of ""victory After High School"", I had Victory After College. I have graduated from VHCC with my Science Associates, but still am not sure how to continue on. After reading this book I have really picked up some great ideas on how to continue my education."
1,not PINK!,Me too...I've received a purple raquet. It's ok but I was expecting a pink one. I will go for a refund. I won't waste my time asking for a pink raquet.
5,Very Good,"It's a good toy, bought it for my brother and he loved it. It arrived faster than predicted and was in perfect condition in the package. Overall a pretty good deal and toy!!"
2,Toxic ??,"Don't know about hard to find...I've seen this red hued version in several sites. Its great articulation, very detailed. Its most prominent feature is NOT the red colour, but its smell! Very strong plastic/chemical scent, possibly toxic?? Brought on a headache. Soaked it in soapy water that toned it down some. After, noticed leg joints were really loose. Lost some points for durability. I bought it cheaper than now seen. Guess we know why..."
5,Tired of blah Christian music?,"Like many teenagers, Christian music bothers me. I recently identified why: most Christian artists simply don't have anything to say.This is also a problem in secular pop, but many secular artists, especially rock artists, really have a message to convey, often a deep and profound meaning. Creed is a great example. On the other hand, most Christian artists really only say ""Jesus is good! Rah rah rah!"" and leave it at that, leaving the listener unsatisfied, no matter HOW good their music is.Enter Carolyn Arends. Every song in this fantastic album conveys a message. Her lyrics are fresh and not at all worn out, like a typical Christian artist is. The songs are profound, uplifting, and spiritually envigorating, and on top of it all, it's darn good music.Besides, the first verse of Seize the Day is practically about me :)"
3,Just O_K,"I would not buy any more of his music,He should put the titles in english as wellhe would get more business from the U.S, I bet"
3,Hard Read!,"I purchased this book here through Amazon, and I have to say that I cannot knock the contents of the book per say only that it was a difficult Read. I would say more for a University Setting. This one will take time to finish"
5,"The translation is so wonderful, I wish I could read spanish","Sorry, I did not buy this book from Amazon, but I will by the other Rulfo books available. I found this book in a used book store, I happened to be browsing through. I don't even know what caught my eye, but what a find. This is so beautifully written. I must admit that though I at one time had a strong interest in the Mexican Revolution, I have forgottem much of what I learned, so some of the stories were hard for me to understand in their historical context. The writing is so evocative, however, that it doesn't matter. The feeling of desolation is almost too overwhelming. I was reminded somewhat of Ernest Hemingway by the use of short declarative sentences, also I suppose because Hemingway often used Spanish phrasing in his work. The best writing, in my opinion, evokes a feeling rather than describing it. Rulfo accomplishes that amazingly."
3,Hard stories of a harsh time and place,"There are no superfluous words, nothing to ease you into the harshness. Each story begins abruptly in the midst of struggle and hardship. Each ends with death and ashes predominate, and scant resolution suggested. The lives described are marked by isolation, coercion and limited options, lived in rocky and inhospitable terrain and in exposed conditions. The writing is consistent with the scenes described, sparse, succinct and unadorned. It makes for a powerful reading experience, but not necessarily a winsome one."
3,The burning plain,"The stories are amazing! Spanish literature is always great. However, the book was looking a bit more torn up than I expected..not cool. But overall..this was an ok purchase."
2,deflector does not fit properly,"I have had deflector for about 2 months. since install, there has been a slight bend in middle of deflector. I returned and ordered another one and it does the same thing. Contacted the product vendor with no response. installed on a 2012 honda ridgeline. would not recommend this product to anyone with this make /model vehicle"
3,lund bug shield inexpensive and does the trick,Relatively painless to install it went on in about 20 minutes. I believe the only tool required was a phillips screwdriver. One thing that I felt was missing on this bug shield was something that kept it propped up off the front of the hood. The only attachment is to the underside of the hood with the screws provided. I'm concerned that over time with the wind pressure of constant driving that it might warp. I've had it on for about a month now. No complaints it seems to be working as promised.
4,Run Away with the Circus -- for a Little While,"Captivating story about the lives of circus ""freaks"" as they were once called. I liked the varying perspectives presented as the author gave each character the opportunity to relate their stories in the first person."
4,Morbid onlookers look eleswhere,"With ""A Cabinet of Wonders,"" Renee Dodd delivers what is, at heart, a classic tale about the struggle to hold a family together, despite insurmountable forces.If you're like the rubes of the 1920's and 30's who gawked at the performers in traveling freak shows in order to satisfy some dark and morbid curiosity, then this may not be the book for you.Dodd's narrative doesn't play to shock and revulsion; instead, the author chooses to draw the reader in with honest and open characters, and she does so in a way that evokes empathy and even a degree of understanding about how such considerable physical deformities are sometimes considered a blessing for those who bear them.In essence, Dodd's characters reveal the truth--albeit uncomfortable for some--about so-called ""freaks;"" Other than their obvious physical traits, they're just like the rest of us."
5,Interesting,"Full of interesting, well developed characters and well written. A few surprising twists and a believable story. Difficult to put down."
2,misled,"A Cabinet of Wonders is an interesting read.However, I was stunned to have sexual situationsthat were unexpected. This is the second timeI have been misled by a Kindle Book. The first was a book aboutAu Pairs (?) in Florida. I am not a prude, but if I want to read aboutsexual encounters there are plenty to choose from.I expected something totally different. Maybe I did not readfar enough in the reviews,but if it has this kind of sex in it theyshould be more upfront about it."
5,Battlefield Britain,"This DVD was as enjoyable as the ""Battlefields Series"" I have viewed on the Military Channel. I look forward to those episodes becoming available on DVD."
2,"Difficult to read, easy to destroy",The map is in the standard scale(for Ethiopia). However it is rather focused on entertainment and tourist friendly then traveler friendly. Poor quality of paper makes it much to easy to be destroyed
5,Buy the Snap N' Style Dolls at Playschool.com-Its much cheaper!!!,I am looking at getting my daughter some of these for Christmas this year and I want other moms who are thinking about them also to know that they are much cheaper if you buy them directly from Playschool.com. The dolls(with the first set of clothes)are only $12 and you can get all of the extra sets of clothes for $6 each including the ones they are trying to sell on here for $20! Check it out!
1,BEWARE THESE ARE FROM VIET NAM NOT NORTH ATLANTIC,"I purchased these thinking they were Harvested in the North ATLANTIC. Yet when the box arrived it clearly states that it is a ""PRODUCT OF VIET NAM"". I don't trust any fish from Southeast asia. The box arrived today and I haven't opened it up yet and plan on returning it for fraudulent advertising. If it doesn't bother you to purchase from VIET NAM, then go ahead and purchase it. I wanted NORTH ATLANTIC WHICH THIS CLEARLY STATES IN THE DESCRIPTION. Therefore, I gave it a one-star review."
3,Mayan Mystery,"Intriguing mystery that I did enjoy from beggining to end but I have to admit my frustration multiple times in the book where the heroine literally stands dumbfounded without asking questions or acts as if nothing happened when she was practically attacked!?I feel this book is also offered under the wrong genre. While there was some romantic interest I wouldn't classify this book as a romance. The description of the book leads you to believe it's going to be prominent throughout the story and it just isn't. No more then simple, sweet, fleeting kisses.Overall this was a good read and the author paints a detailed picture of Mayan culture for the reader but I probably would have given it more stars had I actually been in the mood for a mystery and not expecting a romance."
3,Mystery and romance,A tidy little light mystery. It is not a thrilling page-turner but I felt compelled to keep going just to find out if my suspicions were right. I enjoyed reading it.
2,Path of the Jaguar,Good historical information is provided in a disjointed and poorly edited narrative. Do not bother unless you have time to waste.
2,Not a good read,"This was very amateurish with its construction. The characters were not well developed, the plot was predictable. Cannot say I would spend money for it."
4,Intrigueing.,"Holds your interest. Having been there, I can just imagine the places and people. Difficult to put down. Leaves one longing for what will come next."
5,Amazing!,"This book was about 16 year old April who is diagnosed with Tuberculosis (TB). To get well again, she must live in a TB hospital where she must undergo various treatments. April soon meets Ravi, an Indian prince, and he show interest in her. As April's condition worsens, April and Ravi's love for each other gets stronger.This was really an amazing book! It is also based on the author's actual life experiences. For me, I could not put the book down, I was hooked. I would reccomend this to everyone, especially those who are in the mood for reading about a truly sweet romance."
4,It was pretty good,"I enjoyed ""The Year of My Indian Prince"" a lot. It is about a girl that is stuck in a TB (Tuberculosis) center where she is receiving treatment. Meanwhile, she meets up with a handsome prince from (where else) India. They become buddies... etc. The plot is interesting but I was a bit skeptical at first. The title reminded me of another story. The Summer Of My German Soldier. Do you see the simularities?"
4,"Very, very nice--and having a real-life tragedy in it, might make a pretty good opera itself!","Not just the development of a little girl into an operatic superstar, this DVD also shows--without, I think, consciously meaning to--the development of a narcsisistic self-involved prima donna into a real human being with humility after she suffered the humbling blow of giving birth to two deaf children who would never be able to appreciate her gifts.It also has numerous selections of her singing various operatic arias and duets, some not available elsewhere, such as the ""Willow"" solo from =The Ballad of Baby Doe,= which was particularly beautiful.Steven A. Ager, M.D."
2,HA!,"you'd think with a name like Dearly Beheaded you'd have some kind of erotic type goth, i.e. Moonspell or Theatre of Tragedy. but no, to me and a friend it sounded like 80's metal meets power/prog. if you like machine head, king's X, dream theater, buy it. but if your going to buy judging byu the title, don't, you'll be disappointed"
4,down the rabbit hole,"Book was received timely & in good shape as promised. Very good read although short, would have liked it to go on & on. Not your fault..just thought I would mention it."
5,Great Read,"For those seeking a more liturgical, catholic (universal) faith, Webber's book is outstanding. Coming from a pentecostal background myself, and now pastor of a United Methodist Church, I believe that Webber has given us a model for the future of the Christian church. We concentrate on what divides us and he has shown in this work what unites us.I recommend this book and a good companion volume would be his ""Evangelicals on the Canterbury Trail""."
2,Blatant RIP-OFF of Body-for-Life!!!,"The only difference between the Lean System Success Plan and Body-for-Life is instead of Myoplex & EAS supplements being recommended, it recommends iSatori supplements (the author's company - just like Bill Phillips did).You eat 3 solid food meals and 3 nutrition shakes. Bill Phillips recommended 3 Myoplex (EAS) shakes a day and Stephen Adelle recommends 3 Eat Smart (iSatori) shakes a day.If you've read Bill Phillips' Body-for-Life then definitely DO NOT read this book! And if you haven't read either, then choose Body-for-Life!"
4,Song List,The Cd has 11 songs. They are:1. Such A Shame2. Waiting3. The Way We Used To Be4. Broken5. Weak6. Before I Fell7. Winter8. Only One9. Something Better10. So Different11. Cold Daylight
3,"Content excellent, formatting lousy","I really enjoyed reading this novel, and it didn't take long to draw me in so that I was impatient to finish it. Occasionally the author has a turn of phrase or makes a comment that causes you to sit up suddenly and take notice. Ngaio Marsh is sorely underrated.Now, the formatting. Somewhere roundabout Chapter 2 or thereabouts, the paragraph formatting changed to centered text. This is inexcusable. The novels are available elsewhere as a collection at a much cheaper price per book than Amazon is charging. There would appear to be a substantial profit margin, yet there is not the quality control to check that the text is formatted properly. Fortunately the text reverted to fully justified again, and I was able to lose myself in the novel once more instead of being distracted by the layout."
3,Surfeit indeed,"This book generally is considered Marsh's best mystery, but I dissent. It is more a comedy of manners with an incidental murder. Those who value the puzzle plot most should look elsewhere. BTW, the English title is Surfeit of Lampreys, a much better title than the dreary Death of a Peer. And I agree...a little lamprey goes a looooong way."
1,Disappointed,It says something about Amazon - I'm not sure what - that I was asked to review this book. That's because I've been waiting for several months and Amazon still has not sent me the book!
5,Wonderful Bat,This bat is great. I live in Alaska and alot of the bats have trouble here because of the colder weather in the summer time. But this bat has not dented at all. I would highly reccommend this bat to anyone in a colder climate where the temps would be below 60 degrees most of the time. Great Bat! Great Price!
2,Not Good At What It Is Designed To Do,"In my mind, the purpose of these notes are to help you remember details from the book. These Cliffs Notes do not have the summmary that most of the Cliffs Notes do, so I found them t be not very useful. Don't waste your time or money. And if you were thinking about using these notes instead of reading the book, I assure you that this edition is one of the Notes that does not allow this to be possible!"
2,Not very good at helping me recap details,"Of course, I always read the Cliffs Notes, ONLY after I have read the book. These notes were not very good at helping to recap some of those specific details that Cliffs Notes should help one with. I would try Barron's Booknotes here."
4,A series of quotes that can be applied to farming with pictures of people doing that,"This book is a series of quotes with companion images of farmers, some posed and others while working. The quotes are generally from famous people and while they can all be applied to farming, many can be applied to several aspects of the human condition. Therefore, the title is a misnomer, these are not quotes from farmers, they are messages about farming and farmers.Despite the growing industrialization of all aspects of our society, including farming, there is still something very attractive about tilling the soil. Thoughts of preparing the land, planting the seeds, watching the plants develop and then harvesting the crops all are part of every national consciousness. This is a nice book to give as a gift to farmers of all types, from the old to the current to the merely wistful."
5,Great item,"My son loved this gift. It is very light weight and holds a good amount of water, Easy to use ...Perfect"
1,not enough water and not enough storage,"This camelback doesnt hold enough to properly hydrate for an hour long ride. theres not enough storage to put a pump, keys, phone and id. the straps are way too big too, they flop around when you are riding unless you strapt the straps down. go with 3L or 100 oz. This thing really needs to be broken in to hold the 2L."
3,what's new?,"For me, the most valuable aspect of the book was its clinical wisdom. I don't consider a collection of ideas a ""new theory,"" however, nor do I see why the ""lifegiver""-disrupted relationship concept at the root of the author's vision of narcissism says anything more innovative than ""the child has chosen unconsciously to turn away from his or her inner aliveness."" Some good critiques of traditional theories of narcissism."
3,"This book is cool, but there is better","This book is incredibly cool. It has 15 ViewMaster reels with it that give you an up-close look at some things that can go wrong with your eyes. In fact the problem with this book it that it is too close -- and all the VM photos look more or less the same.However, Volume II -- ""Orbit, lacrimal apparatus, eyelids, and conjunctiva"" by David D. Donaldson is much better. Stomach-churning pictures of the grossest eye problems you've ever seen -- all in glorious ViewMaster 3-D.Both of these books are must-haves, but after Donaldson's masterpiece, Gass' is a little bit of a let-down."
5,Great socks for the big guy,These socks are very comfortable for anyone. But they are really nice for bigger men. The top of the tube sock is bigger than normal socks. This means you don't get restriction you might get with a normal tube sock. I like them a lot.
4,"""Great Intro to the Faith""","Since 1927, for a whole generation now, Rev. Joseph Malloy's ""A Catechism for Inquirers"" has sold millions of copies and has served as a basic instruction manual for inquirers seeking to begin learning the elementary concepts of Catholic faith and practice. This revised edition, by Rev. Edward H. Peters, retains the same basic structure as the original except, of course, in reference to the decrees promulgated at Vatican II. An appendix, also, containing several Catholic prayers, rites and precepts, has been added to this edition, making this one a step above the others. Overall, this concise manual is clear, orderly and set up so that individuals, once finished with this, may then move on to the large Catechism with significant background information. This is great for CCE and RCIA"
5,Excellent source of protein - fast and easy,"I have been using Twinlab liquid protein for years and highly recommend it. The plain, non flavored protein is pretty nasty, but the cherry flavored liquid is not that bad, it's is something you can get used to.With the liquid protein, I get the protein I need without having to drink several protein drinks a day - and having that bloated feeling afterward. This is by far the easiest and fastest way for me to get my protein fix - no blender, no mixing, no hassle, just grab a tablespoon out of the drawer and start pouring. Another plus is if I am a little hungry, but I want to wait a couple of hours before eating, I just take a few tablespoons, and it curbs my appetite until I'm ready to eat.As far as prices go, Amazon has been the cheapest place I have found for this product. I uaually buy 6 or more bottles at a time, and most sites charge a lot of money for shipping because of the weight. You can't beat Amazon's price with the free shipping!"
1,'bitter taste,"The taste is not good, leaves an after taste, I do not recommend it. You have to hold your nose when you take it."
2,Kindle version not so good,"The kindle version has lots of typos in it and when the book was published he had typed up diagrams in it and now in the kindle version those are all skewed too. The content is still there on the kindle, but it's got a lot of things that need to be fixed"
3,Cookbook revised.,"Downloaded the Cookbook to my Kindle because my original copy was still packed away. I didn't realize this is apparently a newer edition. Some of the ""recipes"" I was expecting are no longer there and there are lots of new ones that weren't even imagined when the first edition was published."
5,This book kicks!It's great FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES!!!!!,"This book contains some very cool(but very dangerous) recipes for bombs, telephone fraud, hacking etc.The section on how to piss off McDonalds was great, however I strongly suggest you do not try any of these things(with the exception of the harmless bombs)."
3,dont try this at home,"great book for the political views but not a very practical resource as everything in this book can be found on youtube or other similar sites if u want the nostalgia trip or would just like to say that you own the book by all means buy it but for the practical ""prepper"" just go to youtube"
5,Hope you have a lot of ice for your bathtub,"First read the book in the 70's and was told I could not get it ordered, went into another bookstore and got it off the shelf. I have not made any recipies but am keeping the book (in the original bag) for the future just in case."
1,An excellent guide to self-destruction.,"The Anarchist Cookbook is among the most flawed books I have ever read. Anyone attempting to use the recipes is likely to seriously harm themselves (i.e., blow themselves up with a faulty explosive, or poison themselves with badly made drugs). Further, the concept of violent action to bring social change is the worst possible assault to the anarchist ideal, as it forces the will of the anarchist on others, while anarchy is a philosophy based on individual liberty. Besides, the more subversive violence enacted, the tighter the fist of the politicians. As a serious guide for the anarchist, I'd recommend Rebels and Devils, ed. by Christopher Hyatt, the Illuminatus! Trilogy, by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword by Jack Parsons and the Principia Discordia by Malaclypse the Younger."
2,Oldie but goodie,"I have been following these types of books for years and, since the hippie movement, this would be considered the great grandfather of anarchists books. Just remember though, just because grand-dad is old, doesn't mean he is right. Or for that matter, it doesn't even mean that he has a clue..."
5,"Fun book, some information is probably false",I recommend this book for someone with a slow afternoon. It isfun to read but not the best book to be taken seriously.http://members.tripod.com/~alienboy/mar.html
3,Anarchists Cookbook,"I thought is was informative but in a way useless. I don't plan on making any bombs or trying any recipes for drugs,but i also found it very interesting. I enjoyed looking through it and reading recipes (in my mind making up little seanes of my enimes getting blown up) but knowing that this book was useless unless u where a junkie or criminal except for pleasure reading. So in any case i would suggest it to someone who likes reading books that are just there to shock. It was a good book,but useless."
1,Ridiculous,"This book was a complete waste of time and money. I bought it for a class project expecting some sort of explanation of the pre-cursors of anarchy. It had no information at all about that. All it talked about was drugs and explosives. If you want that crap join the army or something. I have taken a basic chemistry class, and was looking at some of the formulas out of curiosity and he got a lot wrong. A basic chem class taught me that. I don't even want to think about what a real chemist would think. Just for anyone thinking about getting this book, it would be unbelievably stupid to try anything in there. There is a reason that professionals are in charge of building and applying the stuff in this book."
4,*T H E F I R $ T A M M E N D M E N T*,"I found this book to be annoyingly.....Revised. If I were to ever truly be in need for recipes (whether it may be drugs or for the creation of bombs, neither of which I will need anymore) I would ask knowledgable friends, or shall I say more knowledgable fiends, because in the end, there is nothing more valuable than the lessons learned from your trials and your errors.....I have learned from my own experience that this stage in my life may have been less knowledgable, but at least we are protected by the first ammendment. If we are not able to learn for ourselves, then we might all be unfortunate Christian followers who end up leading nonproductive lives, just because we were taught to do so....."
4,Decent,"I must say I think it was written by the goverment some way or another, it was titled ""Anarchist Cookbook"" to attract teenage males who think anarchy is chaos. Which anarchy is not. Good way to set up the market. Over all it was a good book, very informational, all of the stuff seems to work. If you do read it, borrow it from a friend, or buy it direct from the store, if you get it at the library, or mail order, chances are, your adress could end up in the wrong hands. There is nothing illegal about reading this book, but making the things inside are"
3,Books are never dangerous......,"I bought this book because I hear so much about it, espesially considering I live in North Denver. I hear people bragging about ""buying it for a friends birthday"" and stuff like that. In my opinion though it's nothing more than a piece of history that never died out. I'm only 17, I understand how radical your political views can be during war, and I know there's been times I've hated the government. Although, now I'm beginging to know that even though the govenrment has made mistakes in the past, with out extreme political views, none of us would be where we are today. It just balences everything out. This book is a great way to show our governments history, not for crazy kids trying to build bombs in thier basement. Books and movies arent dangerous, only the people that take them seriously."
3,Nice to know but never needed,"I got this book thinking it would be kind of cool to see what was in it, when it came down to it a lot of it is overkill. The author has some good points in his address. There is some stuff you may find useful like picking a master lock because I have lost keys before to mine, but I really didn't read in depth because there is no need to be making bombs much less knowing how to. I believe you should find some more valuable reading material. Unless there is some type of zombie apocalypse ongoing I will leave this book to gather dust."
3,Insight of Error,"As most extreme, visionary teenagers do, Powell explores the antitheses of law and order. Having applied a few of the formulas as written, I can attest that their functionality is formidable. However, in afterthought, I learned more about the meandering of an undirected adolescent psyche than I did about the practical application of the formulas. I suggest that readers abide by all state and federal laws, and enjoy the book for the ideological blurbs that exist throughout."
4,the anarchist cookbook,"Quite a funny & shocking book.By no means would i try the recipes, but it is quite fun to read and learn what an be done with house hold products."
4,pretty good book,"this is a pretty good book... yeah it has about three mistakes that everyone online says shows the quality of information but it realy doesnt, i have read most of the book skimming through the part about drugs and mainly looking at the electronics and wepons sections and i have to say its a good basic guide to common wepons and makeshift/modified wepon. even though most of the information including the part on explosives does sound right in theory but I would not try any of it but if you are willing to risk using the substitues suggested becarful."
3,"Okay, I Guess","First off, this is not a novel. It is literally a ""cookbook"", full of recipes to construct various weapons, booby traps, drug grows, etc. Some of the info is a bit out dated (the book was written about 40 years ago) but still entertaining to read. 99% of the recipe's should NEVER be tried at home. You could get hurt BAD. My favorite section is the one on hand to hand combat and non lethal weapons. The contents of that particular section could still be utilized today. Overall, it was okay. Not amazing, not horrible, just okay. If you don't buy it, your not really missing out on anything."
4,LEXSPEAK,"I discovered this book in the early days of Punk Rock (79-82) and it gathered dust on my shelf but I always was sure to make it's presence known to my fellow punkers as ANARCHY was a punk buzzword.....Well about 10 years later during college I began to read and salivate at the ideas in the book and the motivation for them are NO starnger to me. Matter of fact I find that I would be writing ""recipes"" myself in my head for the next, well I still am. Anyhow- I do not like the Police or Prisons or Jails and the system that surrounds them. I do not wish to depose of it However, I think that fairness has been lost on society's need to have a victim and an agressor in all ""two partie"" crimes. FAIR = or JURISPRUDENCE whatever you want to call it this books beckons all those screwed at anytime. I wish there was more info on invisibility and guilt shift locking but Oh Well, Lex"
4,Interesting and fun,"The Anarchist Cookbook is a classic piece of literature among the ""underworld"". Even though it is an extremely outdated book, with a copyright of 1972 it is still fun and intersing to read. As a question to everyone who might read this, or if the author (crossing finegrs) can see this. Has anyone ever thought about writing and publishing an updated version?...1999!! Something to think about, could make some goo d money. PLEASE BRING US ANOTHER ONE!!"
2,Nothing Special,You can find anything listed in this book on the internet. All you probably won't find is the crudely drawn or scanned images in the book. Worth little more than a conversation piece
2,"Very interesting, but to try this stuff is for IDIOTS ONLY","First of all, the ""Cookook"" has absolutely nothing to do with real anarchism. I'm not quite an anarchist, but I do believe in very limited government (Libertarionist). It's good for showing off, but if you are thinking of trying this stuff, just replace the title with ""1001 STUPID Ways To Kill Yourself."" If not, ""1001 Funny Jokes"" is good too. Go ahead and buy it, but keep it away from kids, especially teenagers. And don't hurt yourself by taking it in the wrong context. Most of the drug recipes are plain ol' poison, and most of the explosives/etc. are likely to get you into either a jail or a morgue."
3,Knowledge is power.,"If you skip the Commie crap, the book is worth keeping. The information is availible to anyone with a computer but most of the research has been done for you.This book should be a part of every survivalists library."
2,Some good information,A good book for refrence material for the HAZMAT courses I teach. If you are buying this with the intent to use the information be really careful because some of the information is flat out wrong and will get you hurt and it will also get you put on a few watch lists.
3,Great fun facts,"Not for everyone and to be taken very seriously, a great resource to have when things are no longer normal and you need to think outside the box."
2,Health hazard,"Having grown up with a penchant for blowing things up (e.g. old model planes and cars, coffee cans, nasty neighbors' mailboxes, etc.) I looked forward to buying this book when it came back into print a number of years ago. Although I was fascinated by the retrospective, I was greatly disappointed in its recipes. Almost all of them involve the synthesis of nitroglycerine, a very powerful but VERY unstable compound. Unless you are willing to blow yourself into the hereafter, avoid this book."
4,Very descriptive. Entertaining.,"The book contains enough valuable information to either clean your house, Or clean it off the map. It's not the material of a book that causes things to happen. It's how the people that get the information decide to use it."
5,A great book for the people that know how to use it.,"I can't believe you people saying that ""The Anarchist Cookbook"" is for ""Anarchist""'s, and people that want to get back at the world. Most of you people don't know what you are talking about. This book is not to be taken lightly. This book is just an informational reference. NO ONE should react upon reading this book, because if you do, you obviously don't realize the purpose and potential of this book. I am an ""Anarchist""."
5,For Entertenmient Only.,It was a very good book and tells yo uexactly how to make bombs traps and many other illegal things but they are ILLEGAL but since most people dont have access to certian substaces metioned in this book (and if they did doing things in this book arn't all that bad compared to what they have already done)Read and laugh and prayed to everything good in this world that you wont have to use the things metioned in this book
3,Just some words,"Well, although this book is a bit of a legend, I find it nearly useless. Any information in this book can be found on the internet or many other books. Either case can be cheaper, by far. There are many books that can be bought at maybe 10 dollars, holding at least half the information in TAC, with twice the accuracy on the subjects under discussion."
5,Great Book,"I had a copy of this book back in the early 70s and thought it might come in handy one day. I, too, became a christian, but finally got over it. Religion has killed, maimed, and destroyed more people and civilizations than this book could ever hope to. Besides, it is great reading. This book is a symbol of the freedoms we enjoy in this country and should not be censored or taken off the market. Just because you think Big Brother is not watching, does mean he isn't. Let the citizen beware."
3,One hell of a book,"The ""Anarchist Cookbook"",by William Powell, provides more insight into late sixties, early seventies revolutionary thinking, than it does the ""bad stuff"" (bombs, weapons, etc.) which can be found in most librarys anyway. I found the introduction very interesting, as well as Powell's running commentary of government and society throughout the book. Although I don't agree with Powell's views, I believe in his right to express his views, as well as present this type of information. At the rate we're going, in 50 years your government may decide to outlaw this book, along with Catch-22, Brave New World, and Animal Farm."
3,"Interesting, but unsafe","First published in the turbulent '60's, this book has attained a sort of cult status for that time. It reflects many of the mores and problems of that generation of young people, and is worth it for a read for that, if for no other reason.So far as bomb-making and all of that, the book is technically good, but the methodology involving use of nitrogen compounds, particularly red, fuming nitric acid and cotton, to make guncotton, is fundamentally ununsound and unsafe. You could blow a hand off or worse very easily, following Powell's directions. I think ""The Monkeywrench Gang"" and others of its genre are more in tune with today's eco-warrior desires. Also, the book never mentions the superiority of Oxydol and its green beads, as a binding agent for homemade napalm. For shame.Even with these quibbles, the book is entertaining, and offers a clear glimpse into the mentality of a now-settled generation."
1,Dangerous,I was in the military for quite some time working with explosives of all kinds....let me tell the prospective buyer of this book this....The recipes contained in this book are dangerous and can often be lethal. They teach us about this book in our job school and the recipes are extremely volatile and unstable. Losing a hand or arm or your very life is a real possibility if you start trying to make stuff in this book. Use at your own risk....hope you have your will done up......
4,An Interesting Book,"The ""Anarchist Cookbook"" is full of useless but very interesting information. This book gave me tons useless knowledge but, it makes for very interesting conversations. Most of the instructions in this book are extremely hard and dangerous to perform. Some of the instructions are not descriptive enough and leave some questions unanswered. This book is excellent reading for entertainment purposes. And maybe if you have an extremely eventful and adventurous life you might use one thing that you learned. I do not suggest that you try any of the instructions in this book. This book makes fun reading and when placed correctly in you home can make for interesting conversations and maybe some nice rumors."
4,BEWARE OF GOVERNMENT,I found the book funny and hilarious but former members of the military do not. Most of the recipes can cause damage not only to others but also to yourself if you are not careful and plan first. I bought the book just because the government doesn't want people to have it.
3,The book is a Period Piece,"The ""cookbook"" as it was known when it was first published, is in the same genre as A.Hoffman's ""Steal this Book"" -- what the other reviews fail to realize is that most of the material is harmless (any 1st year mining engineer's text tells much more) and the period is the message: Nixon, the King and Robert Kennedy assassinations, the escalation of bombing in Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos - the Pentagon papers coupled with G. Gordon Liddy's insane forays into a psychiatrist's office and the abortive Watergate break-in by 3`rd rate Cuban CIA operatives led to the Weather underground and the feeling that the next US revolution would have to happen if Nixon were to attempt a third term. The book is a reaction to much social unrest and the rejection of popular mandate by the legislative, executive and judicial branches.Never the less, this is not a book for children or parties given to violence. It is a social commentary with fireworks."
3,From a soldier that knows explosives,"This book is a good choice for someone from the country that wants to blow off their own hand. As a combat engineer I say your best bet is to go with TM's and government issued manuals on explosives. The sketches and directions in this book are sloppy and sometimes hard to follow, so save yourself money and a hospital trip and buy something that an expert has written."
2,If you really want to know about the book read this,"This book is sometimes deemed the ""holy grail"" of handbooks about stuff your not supposed to know about. Unfortuantly it is in fact a poor exuse for such a title. Although it shows a good amount of stuff that is possible to do, it forgets to tell you how to do it, or do it easy. This book is good for people who have no idea about demolitions and HTH combat, although if you are a veteran of such stuff you better find some place else to invest your money"
2,Research Only Please...,"This is an interesting look at a naive current of the past counter culture. I certainly wouldn't suggest using this information to even experiment with explosives. A more accurate title would be, ""The Disgruntled Idiot's Guide to Rebellion."""
5,Interesting...,This book is interesting to say the least. It has everything from how to care for pot plants to how to get high off nutmeg/peanuts and destroy bridges. neither of which I would advise. There's a lot of interesting stuff in this book but the stuff is all really dangerous. so it kind of makes it a stupid buy because you wouldn't really do any of the stuff listed. all in all an interesting read. Before you buy be aware that this is the 2002 publishing and not the original from 1971. A lot of stuff got removed by the government. You may be able to find online through the freedom of information act what they actually removed. Still there's plenty of stuff in it.
4,Advice...,"Legitimate stuff here, put simply if you decide to try this stuff out just remember this is the 2002 version, some stuff has been edited. the group of editors probally changed certain things to bring harm to the users in an attempt to thwart bad intentions against our government. However the best things to do would be harmless activities like tennis balls, smoke bombs, or stuff you could watch on youtube essentially. when things like this have a second publication most likely the intent of the editors is to stop the user from hurting people by ""accidently"" hurting themselves, if you payed attention in high school or college chemistry: your good! :D"
4,well,Well honestly i was ubnder the impression that it would contain different information when i ordered it but hey its very inciteful anyways .. Came in a timely manner and pretty affordable.
2,Yes and No,"This book is a must have for any collection of books on touchy subjects. It is though very dated, poorly written and laughably illustrated. If you are looking for usefull information I would recomend The Poor Man's James Bond. Again this is a must have book but it earns that rank by nature of its place in history not its usefullness."
2,Good section on drugs.,"I bought this book because I remenber how much I liked it when I was in high school. I got it from amazon.com in three days!Reading it now, I realize the only thing I found useful in the book was the section on drugs. I also found that the author was very good in talking about what is dangerous for you and what isn't. But besides the chapter on drugs I found the rest of the cookbook boring. I still feel it is a good addition to any book collection though."
1,Junk and worthless are not strong enough words,"The Anarchist Cookbook is a worthless book. It has attained some kind of almost ""mystical"" following in that people may think it offers real advise, and it is somehow ""cool"" to have read it. But seriously, it is so badly flawed and so ridiculous that no one should take it seriously. What it actually is is just worthless ramblings and concoctions on how to make a fool of yourself and maybe get seriously hurt. Basically it says play around with gasoline, light a match and see how badly you can get burned. To try any of the recipes is like jumping off a bridge and then wondering why your legs are broken. Honestly, read the original author's disclosure, and you will see that the Anarchist Cookbook is just drivel."
1,Wrong book.,"This is not the book written by William Powell, whatsoever. Powell wrote very well, and presented a very sound and intellectual approach to anarchism, as well as a compilation of information he felt the masses might one day need to have on their side. This is instead a collection of ways to hack and prank the systems of the modern world from an old online library, and more than a few of them are incredibly outdated. Amazon should do something about this."
1,cookbook was a disapointment,"Well I have heard about the Anarchist Cookbook for years now,so decided to read it for myself.Well frankly, the book sucks,it has no great detail about anything,and I have read better stories and books written by junior high students. And to tell you the truth if you want to learn about survival;get the boy scouts of america hand book,itll teach you alot more and wont insult your intelligence."
1,Shame,"Amazon, you should be ashamed of yourselves to sell this book. It has caused nothing but damage and heartbreak since it's first printing ( the same goes for you Lyle Stuart) I believe in absolute freedom of the press, BUT, companies as big as Amazon have a responsibility not to sell such dangerous and wrong headed items.SHAME ON YOU!"
3,Daunting For those that don't have a choice.,"I am 26 years old and HAD to have a hysterectomy to basically save my life. A lot in the book scared me, I felt like I was fated to shrivel up into an old woman, even though I'm still young. The nutritional advice was valuable, as was the section on what to expect from sex after the surgery."
5,A wealth of information for any woman contemplating hysterec,"This book contains a wealth of information on hormones, nutrition, excercise, and a womens health and well being following a hysterectomy. Had I started to read this book sooner, I would have presented even more questions to my GYN prior to my surgery. Every woman facing this difficult decision can learn a great deal from Dr. Cutler about her body and how to maximise her health following her surgery. I thank her for her knowledge and the information that she has passed on to me."
5,"Excelent, can't put it down.","I should of had bought this book before my hysterectomy. Even thou I had medical reasons for a total hysterectomy, this book tells all, your options, protecting your health, hormone therapy decisions, future health risks. This is the only book to buy. It's complete.....Thanks to the Author, Dr. Cutler.........."
3,"Excellent photographs, but limited coverage","Holding claim to some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, I was disappointed that this book did not have more Costa Rican beach shots. I did enjoy the unique perspective of covering the culture from a human standpoint, but I would have enjoyed a little more diversity."
2,Overated,"Although Mr. Gallop's cultural knowledge of the Basque's (at least the French Basques) was very in depth, The narration is dreary, pompous, and one-sided. The author concentrated on the French Basques while neglecting the Spanish. Another unfortunate point is that it did not offer anything after 1930. I see that progress has been made over seventy years by the Spanish Basques and all they have had to endure. It wasn't until the latter chapters of this book that the reader becomes interested. This subject is very dear to me and after extensive study I would consider other sources to learn about the Basques. Agur."
5,Southpole Jeans,The word I think about when I put these jeans on are comfort.These are worn with your favorite pair of boots.
5,Awesome Southpole Sandblasted Clean Jeans,True to size - Love the sandblasting effect. Sandblasted through the thighs and dark on the inside and outside of the leg. Makes my husband's legs look thinner!
4,Seems to work.,"I have to say I bought this as a preventative measure, I just spotted a single moth in my closet once and it was instantly blown to smithereens (RIP) but since I hung those cedar planks I haven't seen any more. The cedar scent wasn't strong so I sanded them lightly and I think its best to do so once a year."
5,CEDAR HANG UPS,"This is a good price for a good product. Hard to mess this product up, but some versions are really not that great and are overpriced. This was reasonable and I probably will buy more."
3,Lost its smell,I love the fact that they hang in the closet but they had lost thier smell by the time I got them so not sure they are doing any good.
5,Wisdom and Experience,"Successful software projects need to be organized and managed opposite to successful companies, because of the need for creativity. This book points out the differences in crystal clarity, with very specific suggestions on what to do at each stage of moving software projects forward. Of particular interest are shortcomings of the other approaches such as waterfall, hands-off, and rapid prototyping. Details on how to use RUP (Rational Unified Process) with UML examples are provided as well."
1,"I wanted the story, not just the music.","I love the story Distant Serenade told by Celeste Holmes. I thought that was what I was getting. The music without the story (like this CD) is disjointed and missing key elements...not to mention sounds terrible. I got this for me and my daughter to enjoy the story and she can't stand it...to be honest, neither can I . It's just not the same without the story."
4,Early 20th Century Highland County Virginia,There was a lot of genealogical and historical information in this book. It was greatly appreciated by my Wife's 95 year old Mother who grew up in Monterey.
1,Not as good as these reviewers claim!,Look I get the message. Hollywood and society are crazy and so on and so on. The movie is an overblown bazaroo land that is well for lack of a better term REDICULOUS. Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors its not his performance its just that the movie itself was stupid. This movie is not even a decent rental. I dont recommend this movie to anyone even when it is for free on TV.
1,hysterical,"Okay, I thought this movie was a joke. My husband and I were laughing hysterically, but because it was so ridiculous. I am a HUGE Pacino fan, so this was disappointing. I still can not believe he would even take this role."
1,Pacino Has Reached A Low Point In Acting,"After The critical sucsess of the the Thriller ""Insomia"" Pacinobroke ground with some intense action best i've seen from himin a long time. So after seeing this film ""Simone"" i thoughtit wasn't funny or compelling at all. Pacino plays a directorwho's going through a slew of emotional problems when he encounters a computer enhanced model to impersonate an a real life actress. Bogus storyline Hard to imagine a star of Al Pacino's Magnuitude taking part in this considering the awesomebody of work pacino has done in the past why would he take on therole of a crazed idiot and possibly damange his great carrer? This film is definatly not for the die-hard pacino fans."
1,A bad idea,"Just awful. At least no animals were abused during the filming of S1mone, or Simone, whatever they want to call it. The premise (that 5 billion ppl can fall for a ""virtual reality"" star) is ludricous. Even if you somehow are able to suspend disbelief, the plot her is very predictible, and you know the Victor Taransky's (Al Pacino) invented ""star,"" Simone will become so big, that he'll be tempted to destroy his creation.Al Pacino can be very good, or he can be an over-acting buffoon (Author, Author). He's the latter here.How this got financed and put into the theatres is just astounding. The good reviews here? Probably each written by the cast and crew of this stink bomb.But if these people truly liked this film, then the apocolypse is upon us."
3,The illusion of reality,"I really enjoyed this film both in the theaters and as a DVD purchase, although I have to admit that the plot and concept is not as fleshed-out (no pun intended) as it could have been. Pacino's private conversations with S1m0ne are thought-provoking, such as pointing out that most Hollywood actresses are already artificial (through cosmetic surgery) and that it doesn't matter if the actor is real if the performance is. I would have given the film an extra star if they did use a digital actress (though the filmmakers avoided it for SAG reasons), though Rachel Roberts is stunning. Highly recommended for anyone interested in virtual reality and the filmmaking industry (at least in terms of the mentality behind it.)"
3,Simone,"It was a good movie!I think the acting could have been better.At points the movie jumped around in an odd way,but if your up for a unique movie staring Al Picino,and a beautifil girl, you got your movie!All in all it was a decent movie.Simone is gorgeous!"
4,Simone,"In some respects, this film is a contemporary satire of Hollywood. If that is all it is, it can stand on it's own as a good comedy. It goes beyond that and explores the nature of reality. The disillusioned director played by Al Pachino has had it with the impossible prima donnas he caters to. He creates a synthetic digitalized actress on a computer. Through technology, he is able to program all the qualities he wants in a star.When his creation becomes a major success, he is unable to bring himself to reveal the deception. This film explors how images can be substituted for reality. It explors what tangled webs we weave when we attempt to deceive.I would have given this film five stars if the story line had been a little more credible. It was both entertaining and thought provoking."
3,A Japanese anime like actress wins an Oscar,"What is an intelligence? The old test for AI was how long or ifsomeone could tell they were interacting with a computer not a human.The problem is that most of the current actors and actresses aren't'real',but they are still worshiped? The destruction of the hard drive by a virus, leads to some real insanity...They movie then becomes a real comedy!And a child will lead them."
1,SIMONE NEVER COMES TO LIFE,"I remember the theatrical commercials giving me the impression that Simone comes to life ( gains consciousness ) and starts to have some sort of love / hate relationship with the male star.What a bunch of baloney. Throughout the ENTIRE movie, Simone is controlled like a puppet on a string. Al Pacino uses a computer to make her speak whatever he wants her to say. She doesn't have a mind of her own, she doesn't move on her own."
3,Almost Great,"With a little bit of backbone, this film could have been wonderful. But like the story it tells, Hollywood is all about numbers. Not just zeros and ones like computer code, but dollars. If this film had stayed the course and made a serious statement, it would have made a lasting impression. It didn't, and it doesn't. It isn't a bad film, just not fully fulfilled."
1,Believe the other reviews at your own risk,"This is the first review I have written and I only write it to warn those who, like me, read reviews before buying. This movie is awful! The plot is rehashed stuff from other man-creates-digital-character classics like The Lawnmower Man and Virtuosity. At its best, the acting is two-dimensional. The dialogue sounds like it came with the screenwriting software the script was written on. The only good thing I can say about this film is that it appears to be shot in focus. To quote a great film, 'Get Shorty,' ""I've seen better film on teeth.""Nothing pains me more than telling you how bad this film is because the writer/director Andrew Niccol is one of my heroes. His first film, Gattaca, is my favorite sci-fi film of all time! And his script for The Truman Show borders on something divine. This guy is a genius. But this film is a dud. Better luck next time, Andrew!"
4,"""I'm The Death Of Real"" ~ ""When In Doubt, Do It The Taransky Way""","Entertaining and thought provoking venture into cyberspace and a possible future in which holographic reality and the physical world as we know it may eventually intersect.Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) a washed up, recently unemployed motion picture director discovers the perfect actress to resurrect his career from a soon to be deceased computer expert named Hank Aleno (Elias Koteas). This perfect actress is Simone (Rachel Roberts), a computer generated holographic image controlled by Taransky. What director could ask for anything more?'Simone' takes a much needed slap at the all-pervasive media exposure that so dominates our culture and challenges us to look beyond the facade and illusory nature of the entertainment industry and learn to discern.Refuse to submit to the lemming effect and the destructive nature of modern day hero worship. THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX!"
4,Advances in computer technology may now make this possible,"I found this very interesting. At the time the movie was made, they said the technology was not there to do it but with with advances in speech recognition, voice synthesis, graphic editing capablities and cam capabilities, it seems like this now could be done. Anyone interested in computer technology would probably enjoy this film."
4,Ticklishly funny,"My 7 year old has come across this book in his school library and asked to have his own copy. It is also one of my favourites.Edward is not content with being just an Emu, so he tries being every other animal in the zoo, a different one every night. The book describes the different animals in the zoo and a candidly human emu. Edward reminds me of a few people I know, and of myself sometimes, switching between cages to be something different every so often.It is a thoroughly entertaining book and the pictures are extremely funny to look at."
5,"Who Are You, Edward the Emu?","Edward is an Emu. He's an Emu at the Zoo. And he's bored with being an Emu. (What do Emus do, anywho?) He overhears visitors at the Zoo extolling the merits of other animals and subsequently decides to become a Seal. Then a Lion. Then a Snake. And, finally, an Emu. And finds he's been replaced. Which is a bit disconcerting. Yet satisfying."
4,"Excellent, but dated",This book is an excellent compendium of most of the core web technologies. An added bonus is the author used LaTeX so its easy to read and well formatted.Unfortunately this technology is moving so quickly that this book is already outdated. It is easier to track these technologies through online documents.
5,Great for the money!,"I bought several of these as 2006 Christmas gifts for in-laws. I noticed one on my S-I-L's bed and it is still fluffy and firm. I asked her if she still likes it and if it sleeps good and she said, ""Oh yeah. I really like this pillow!""Definitely good buy for the money."
4,good,"I have not used it so much, best if you have a fixed set to place your camera and no need to recharge batteries."
3,A/C power for Canon PowerShot Digital Camer SD600,"I already have a Powershot SD200 and had hoped the charger for it would work with my SD600, but although the electronics appears to be the same, the battery size is different so the SD600 requires a different little plastic adaptor. To get the adaptor, apparently one has to buy a whole new charger (?) This little adaptor is hard to keep track of--there should be some sort of special slot in the charger to stash it safely when not in use, but other than that I'm very glad that this camera has an A/C adaptor at all. I don't think there is much choice here--if you want to connect the SD600 to A/C power apparently this is the adaptor one needs and to use the video capability of the camera indoors, one does need the A/C."
1,Not what I thought it was,"I was looking for a battery charger that plugged into the camera rather than having to take the battery out everytime for a charge. In thinking that, I ordered this adapter and found that it would not work when it wasn't plugged in. Well only after calling Canon did I discover that this was not intended as a battery charger but an optional power source. Why would you want to restrict your walking range to 6 feet while taking pictures at the family bbq? Amazon was nice enough to accept the return of this item and give me a full refund,(5 stars to Amazon for that)."
2,"Very hard, very complicated book. NOT FOR BEGINNERS...","I gave up after day 6. The book has too many typographical errors, and some of the code is hard to follow. If you need a good start on programming in C++, purchase C++ Primer Plus by Stephen Prata."
2,Not the best book for a beginner!,"Borland endorses this book as the official tome to use for learning Turbo C++. Unfortunately, for an absolute beginner it is a difficult book."
3,A good book but it could be better,"This is a good book, but I don't recommend it if you are a new comer with no previous programming experience. The concepts taught and the example code are quite good. The main problems with this book is that there are many small errors here and there that would drive a beginner crazy. The book moves quite fast expecting you to know and pick up certain things quickly. I recommend this book if you have some previous basic knowlegde of C++ and are ready to move onto some basic Windows programming."
2,Don't Buy This Book,This is awfully bad book to learn C++. Sheer waste of money. The code is awful. Horrendous typos. Most of the code is buggy.
4,The man who nobody liked,"Adam Dalgliesh investigates the death of Edwin Lorrimer, an unpleasant biologist found dead in the forensics laboratory. Almost everyobody in the Fens has a reason to kill Lorrimer, which complicates the matter for Dalgliesh. Book is generally up to James' very high standards of quality, but is oddly pale because of the unusually abbreviated role Dalgliesh takes in the novel. Those of you who haven't read P.D. James, do so at once!"
3,Death of an Expert witness,"Author writes a very good book, am looking forward to reading more from the author, and seeing if he can better this one."
5,Death of an expert Witness,I am a fan of P.D James. The author always helps us to understand of all of the charactors and their motivations. It keep me guess un till the end.
4,Vintage PDJ,"A pleasant read, with the usual PDJ devices and turn of phrase.The book begins rather laboriously but later picks up well after the entry of Dalglish."
4,An Excellent British Mystery,One of P.D. James heralds is her character development. She loves to mold & describe them as much as create excellent suspense mysteries. She has the ability to do it wellOriginally written in the late 70's this has none of the fancy DNA & CSI technicalities. It's good old fashioned police work that takes the reader through the mystery.Ms. James writes in a classic British style which is very refreshing. Her descriptions make for very good story telling which keeps the reader turning pages without boring them.I was quite surprised by the ending. She leads up to & carries that off very well
5,P.D. James,"I love P.D. James, and this is a great way to get audio c.ds without paying too much.They are in good listening order and I pass them on to the local library."
4,Good detective story.,"The first 60-65 pages were difficult to get through, because the main character is absent from them. When he does enter, Inspector Dalgleish is not developed nearly as much as he is in other books. We learn very little about him in this book. On the other hand, the search for the murderer is straighforward and interesting. There was the sense that enough clues were provided to the reader to identify the guilty party."
4,death of an expert witness,"I would recommand the death of an expert because it has all the suspence that a murder mystery fan would enjoy.The plot is that a Dr. Lorrimer who was murderd in his own lab, Now Detective Adam Dalgliesh, will try to solve the cold murder, but people in the fens don't like the unplesent doctor, so this complicates the whole senario, because theirs a lot possible suspect.The book provides you to think while you read and this written back in 1977. The plot is complex and also the climax is sharp.Unlike othere murder mystery books or movies the story does not have any flawss at all becaues it is well thought and well written. SO if you found this book don't hesiten (i don't know if i spelled hesitent right, oh well) to buy it."
4,Death of an Expert Witness,"I like this author P.D. James, and enjoy her characters especially Adam Dalgliesh also enjoyed the TV series.Some of her character descriptions tend to be a bit long winded though.Would recommend this book.."
1,I Thought I Had Seen Everything,"HA! HA! Bratz Boyz? You've got to be kidding me! The Bratz girls look like whores and the Bratz Boyz look gay. Cade has to be the fruitest male doll I have seen in my entire life. Anyway, these Bratz dolls belong in an adult toy store instead of a children's toy store . Toss these dolls in the trash where they belong and get Strawberry Shortcake and Huckleberry Pie."
2,THIS WAS BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!,"This book was boring!! There was only a couple funny parts! One good part in the whole story is when they're are trying to steal the test, you keep reading to see what happens. One funny part is when Roy sees the crow and he's scared of it, then when they steal the test Roy's friends (not sayin anymore names) told him to go outside he's like ""I'm not stayin out there wit dat big ass crow!"" I thought that was pretty funny, but you have to read it to see. If you read this book and don't like my review never take opinions from a twelve year old, but out of all the books I read this one was really boring!!"
4,Good for vacations,"This is good for vacations as we have gone on many cruises and float trips where this was of value. You can take pictures under water, at waters surface and even out of the water without work of water damage. Easy to use, but it does make the small compact Canon camera much bulkier than normal. Only bad think is that when under water with a dive mask on, it is had to see the view screen through the plastic case. You just have to take a picture and review it later."
1,Why only 10ft?,"The SD300 looks like a great little camera. I was thinking about upgrading/replacing my S300 (3yr old 2 Megapixel) with waterproof case (100ft), but since can't even get to 10ft it would be pretty useless for SCUBA diving."
4,A very guilty pleasure,"I pull this treasure out every once in a while and enjoy it more and more each time. Yes, the sound is very dated, but the tunes are still danceable and singable twenty years later.While some tunes are obvious fillers, the album/tape/cd is majority loaded with pretty good songs such as ""Love House,"" ""Your House Or My House,"" the dance-pop ""I Only Wanna Be With You,"" and the standard slow song (that is, seemingly, a must on every dance album), ""Out of Our Hands.""Granted, it's not deep stuff when it comes to house or dance, but it's a pretty decent start. - Donna Di Giacomo"
4,"Samantha's Album Is A Lot Of ""Fun""","I first bought this album on cassette in 1989 and when I switched to CD's, I got this one as one of the first. The album is pure pop, and suggestive without being raunchy. The best songs on this set are the title track (edited on every other album it's on--that's why a fan of Fox's HAS TO HAVE this album), ""Your House or My House"", I Only Wanna Be With You"", and ""One In A Million"". There are only 2 songs I did not enjoy: ""Confession"" and ""Out Of Our Hands"". Other than those, the tracks are very upbeat,dancable, and singable. Need some ""Fun""?? Check out Samantha (the) Fox!!"
1,This Album Bites.,"I bought this album on the strength of ""Just One Night"". I wish I hadn't. It isn't near as good as the other album. It's excessively generic. The only song that I actually look forward to hearing on it is ""I Only Wanna Be With You"". One song out of the whole CD. Unless you're a major Samantha Fox fan (in which case you already have this), don't waste your money. Get ""Just One Night"" instead. ""Oh, wait! There goes Barbara Bush! Miss Bush? Miss Bush?"" :)"
3,Good,"This is a good album by Samantha Fox. It features the hits ""I Wanna Have Some Fun"" and ""I Only want To Be With You"". Unfortunatley after this album her career faded into oblivion and I have no idea where she went. I don't think people gave her a fair chance and once the nineties came she disappeared. I hope she returns to the pop scene soon."
3,Sound is bad but the cast and songs are swell.,"Although the booklet notes go to great pains to point out that this is the 1943 revival version of the 1927 show (including six new songs and retaining six of the original), nowhere does it clearly mention that this is the soundtrack to the kinescope of a 1955 television performance of the show. You have to sort of piece that together from clues in the notes. Sound is poor but the performances from Eddie Albert, Janet Blair and Boris Karloff are fresh and the songs are well done. This needs a fresh studio cast recording as this is the only record of the show we have. Worth purchasing for fans of musical theater and Rodgers and Hart but rough going for those who haven't grown a dedicated ""ear."""
4,excellent colours,Absolutely no problem with my Dell Latitude CPx model. take the snaps and transfer in seconds. it may not be very very good from pixel point of view but still it's good enough. The best thing about the snaps are the colours. It's amazing. true natural colours. ...what more you can ask for....
1,HP320,Camera link to computer will not work on Dell computers due to problems with Dell's USB port - port lacks adequate power and you cannot down load pictures from this camera to a Dell computer - see HP online help for further details.
1,HP is an excellent company for printers....,"Buy this camera and you'll be sorry.HP is in the wrong business making cameras. they should stay focused on printers, their forte."
1,wrist strap is useless,"the camera works OK. The wrist strap is impossible to put on. I need it since many users need this on the go and it would save the camera from dropping.The wrist strap was so frustrating, that we wanted to throw it out the window.There is also no case.Can't really recommend it since it gave us so much initial frustrations."
4,Good camera for its price,"In general this camera is very good. It's a bit big and kind of ugly, but the picture quality is good and it is easy to use. I do not use anything but the highest resolution because that is the only way to get real looking pictures. I strongly recommend getting a memory card because otherwise the camera will only take 8 pictures. The program that comes with the camera is basic but good. I particularly like that that the program allows you to make slide-show DVD's of the pictures that are on your computer. I struggled putting the wrist strap on; the best way to go about that is to use a paper clip. The only other disadvantage of this camera is that it takes four AA batteries and uses them up quickly. I recommend either using lithium batteries because they are lightweight and last longer or rechargeable batteries."
4,Great camera for fun pics,"I've had this camera for about two weeks now and I love it. The picture quality is super and it is so easy to use. There is virtually no need to even read the user manual. Just throw in the batteries, turn it on, and start snapping pics. The included software is simply to use and install. It makes downloading the pics onto your compuster a snap. All in all, this camera is a great little camera for fun, casual pics."
5,Excellent - Easy to Use Digital Camera,"The HP PS320 Digital Camera is a solid performer. It is easy to use and delivers great results. I really like the Instant Share capabilities on this unit. This is a very good, inexpensive, easy to use product giving great results."
5,Great Value!,This is the perfect Digital Camera for someone who wants the ease of point & shoot but needs the editing/preview capabilities of a digital unit.Great starter digital camera.
3,not bad,"camera doesn't like 128mb secure digital cards. it just won't read or write to them. the current firmware that ships with this camera needs to be upgraded by the buyer with a sd card that is under 64 mb. also, the picture quality is OK, but not even close to the clarity of canons in the 2 megapixel range. printing out on 4x6 is fine though. small lcd screen! but battery life is good."
3,"As a first camera, it's okay...","When I was given this camera 4 years ago, the HP Photosmart 320 was thought of one of the more technologically advanced cameras of its time.Now years later, with it's bulky body, virtually NO optical zoom, and low megapixel count, this camera is thought more as an electrical monstrosity than anything else.The pictures taken with this ""thing"" usually come out horrible or below average, even on highest quality. Blurred and grainy images are frequent with this camera and red-eye pictures even more. Don't expect much in video mode,On the plus side, the camera is durable, and the pictures come out okay in bright sunlight. The Photosmart 320 is also easy to understand, and buttons are prominently marked and big enought for most finger sizes.If you're looking for a cheap, lower-end point-and-shoot with average shots and durability, this camera is probably the one for you."
3,Good Camera but expect Secure Digital Card Problems,"Camera is great for the price and I was happy to got this with the camera starter pack. But I was disappointed about small scratches on the brand new camera case, probably poor manufacturing. Also if you intend to use a 64MB or 128MB secure digital card with this camera don't be suprised to get errors. The manual tells that the camera works with secure digital cards up to 128MB but that is not true. Many people are even having problems with their 64MB cards. A firmware update at hp.com is needed to solve this issue. But if you have a 64 or 128MB card, then you have to go buy another smaller size card, a 16MB or 32MB for the firmware to be installed. I don't understand why the firmware dated back October 2002 is not installed on a camera sold on September 2003."
3,o k but theres better,"I ordered this cd because I am a big fan of streets, thinking this would be in the same category;not even close the songs are not badly written but nothing really grabs you the vocals are not even close to being near steve walsh , theres better stuff out there"
5,Keep these 2 together!,"As always, Mike Slamer and Billy Greer have teamed up to put out an incredible c.d. again. Can these 2 do no wrong? The guitars are real tight, Billy sings backup mostly, but plays a hell of a bass. I love anything these guys can put together. Musical maestros!! I almost forgot, Terry Brock is a fantastic vocalist with a range that will amaze you."
4,Well-produced soft rock,"This CD is a special project, a one-time collaboration between instrumentalist Mike Slamer and vocalist Terry Brock. Slamer does most of the writing and arranging, contributing keyboards and synthesizer as well as guitar. The result is a very consistent effort, although a bit commercial. Basically, the CD aims for a ""Styx meets Journey"" type of sound, with pleasant, mid-tempo rock songs and upper range vocals. The title track and the conclusion, Superstar, are very good. The rest of the material is certainly competent, and there are no weak tracks."
4,good deal,the item consistent with its description and at the price considerably more affordable than in the store. I highly recommend further purchases out there!
4,Cinderella in the emergency room,"Back Cover description: ""You have no family, no home and no prospect of marrying."" That might be true, but Venetia Forbes didn't see her situation as any reason to accept Professor Duert ter Laan-Luitinga's prosaic proposal! But after tasting champagne for the first time in her life, Venetia was astounded to hear herself saying yes. ""My ward needs an example of a contented, harmonious marriage."" Without love Venetia was convinced their marriage might be anything but harmonious by the time young Anneta went to her aunt in America! And what would happen to their marriage then?This is another typical Betty Neels story-doctor and nurse, but I liked the way the plot moved, and the love grew between them. Though at times Duert's character could be annoying. Why a wife, why not a governess? Venetia's character was quiet and shy, but not a doormat. And the ending was slightly different--the doctor gets jealous."
2,AKA: The Convenient Lunch,"Oh my. This is the first and last Betty Neels book I will be reading. Each meal this couple shared was described in beautiful detail. Each item on every shopping trip was made known to the reader. Coffee was also a main character in this book. Each time the couple decided to share a cup together the reader gets to share it with them.I really wanted to like the characters, instead we learned more about their eating habits than what they were thinking and feeling. I'm giving it two stars because it is a book I would recommend with confidence to my Grandmother, if she will be able to stay awake until the end."
3,Watch the description !!!,"The description mentions the price for 3 x 4 cartridges..(if not on amazon, then on some other e-commerce website which leads to amazon to complete purchase). So anyways on amazon its too pricey, but the customer service is good and would handle concerns."
4,good music,"i like all the songs on the cd,they make me happy and some sad i listened to it 28 times and like it better. thank you,from billy"
5,Worth its weight GOLD !,"This book can DRASTICALLY reduce the amount of time you will spend revising pharmacology. Most review books are written in a paragraph form that does not at all aid the visual memorization of the page ; Something that makes one lose focus as one reads more and, after sometime, the acquired information starts to melt together into a perfectly unrecognizable cocktail that can by no means help one in an exam setting , much less in a clinical one. This book, however ,with its question-answer format, presents the information in a very memorable and thought-provoking manner that makes later revision a MUCH easier task than the revision of other review books. With all due respect to the great and famous Lippincot Pharmacology , this book is a lot better . It has almost all the information in Lippincot but written in a more user-friendly manner. It is GREAT for USMLE Step 1. Be good to yourself and buy this book."
2,Buy the book - COMES WITH AUDIO!,I bought this product as the hardcopy book actually which CAME WITH A CODE FOR ACCESS TO ALL THE AUDIO FILES! Do not pay the same price for audio only when you could get the hardcopy too for basically the same cost. Love the audio but don't pay for it when its free if you just buy the book.
4,Great product,"I had been searching for an audio pharmacy review to listen to while driving. I was so glad to find this product. I've only listened to the antimicrobial chapters so far, but have been very happy with the information presented."
1,The audio is difficult to access,"This book offers access to audio files which is why I purchased it originally. When I tried my access code, it gave me an error. The publisher's office was closed for the holidays, wasting 4 days of study time. When I got them on the phone today, they said this has been a known issue they just haven't bothered to correct. Also, if you want to download the audio to put on your iPod, you have to download 53 different chapters of files. There's no way to do it all at once. No time for that. Pharm FAIL."
2,The Singing Forest,"Terrible movie acting and story line was awful, and the music was terrible, i will be careful when ordering movies in future and maybe read reviews first very disappointing."
1,This forest is OUT OF TUNE,"One of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I kept my finger on ""forward"" button to reach the end of this ""masterpiece"".Everything sucks in this crap movie: acting (is there any?), direction (was there any?), filming, sound and so on.Jorge Ameer should be imprisoned for shooting such a lousy film."
2,hilariously amazingly mindwarpingly bad,"the levels of badness in this film are off the charts. it basically begs to be seen, in the sense that it is difficult to comprehend that it actually exists, even while watching it."
1,A most horrible viewing experiance,"After renting this film last night, I promoptly returned it today and demanded my money back.That is how discusted with this so called movie. It is just about the most terrible thing I ever have seen. There is nothing good about this movie. It is just lame. Non-artistic, poorly directed, with annoying background sounds that overwhelm the viewer so you cannot even understand what the actors are saying at times.I really hated this movie and will go out of my way to warn others not to waste their time on it."
1,REALLY bad!!!!!!,"I hate it when I pay good money for a movie only to realize I will never watch it again and would feel too guilty to sell it to another smuck here at amazon.I could not even get through it the first time. TOTALLY unbelievable, the daddy must have had the daughter when he was what? 14!!! And the fiance falling into bed with the daddy {NUDE} was so fast you would have thought they knew each other from an adult bookstore instead of another time! Bad sound, bad acting, in short..BAD! So when you hear Micheal Jackson sing ""who's bad"" you can reply..""The Singing Forest...that's who!"""
1,This is such a terrible film! A stinker!,"How do films like this even get made? The story, about a father who's daughter is marrying a man he believes to be his gay lover is a past life, is so lame. The acting is even worse. But the writing and directing is the worst I have ever witnessed. It really makes me puzzled how something so terribly made could be released to an unsuspecting public. I feel sorry for anybody that chooses to watch this thing. It will leave you screaming and running to the remote control to turn it off and demand your money back. If I was on an airplane and this was the in-flight movie, I would jump out of the plane without a parachute."
1,A terrible movie!,"And along comes yet another ""no budget"" gay themed film with terrible acting, horrific directing, choppy editing and a bad soundtrack with horrible sound quality. While gay cinema has had many wonderful films the past few years, it has also encouraged some wanna-be film makers into releasing complete trash. This film makes no sense. It's just a complete waste of time for the unsuspecting viewer.And it's billed as a gay version of ""ghost?"" Only in the eyes of the publicity machine. I turned this dvd off after 47 minutes.I finally realised I was better off as this film was agony in terms of trying to watch the entire thing."
2,Not well-written but well-researched,"If you're looking for relaxing weekend reading and a well-spun tale then avoid this book. I imagine that it is excellent source for academic historians of the period. There are scattered references to a few critical incidents all through the book so it is not easy to follow.I was also disappointed that the book is written only from a US-centric perspective with no coverage of the victims of filibustering: did nothing of note happen in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama, etc during the period? How were the coalitions built that finally disgorged Walker and other filibusters from their Central American footholds? The epilogue finally addresses some of the damage that these pirates did to US reputation in the rest of the Americas, but a lot more could be said."
3,It's ok...,"This is an average album too me...nothing spectacular but not the worst I have heard either. For his age he is a pretty decent singer. The song material is not beyond his years which gives you a better sense that he actually knows what he's siging about. There are a few songs that are not too appealing but for the most part my favorite songs are beautiful soul, take your sweet time, because you live, and come to me (eventhough it was taken from Plus One and redone). So the point is, if you like light-hearted pop/pop-rock type music with good beats and decent lyrics, then you'll enjoy this ablum. Good music to cruise too, or bump around the house with friends."
1,WORST CD EVER(DESERVES 0 STARS)!!,"For anyone who thinks this CD is good, i got news for u, ur either gay, or u have awful taste. How this no talent piece of s*** got famous and released a CD, idk. But he should look at himself in the mirror, realize that he is just a puppet for the recording company, break the glass, and kill himself with the broken glass. Any kind of music is better than this. Rap, hard rock, soft rock, R&B, reggae, even heavy metal. $10 said that as bad as the lyrics to this song are, he didn't write them, because he probably doesn't even know how to. He's probably just like Derek Zoolander from the hilarious Ben Stiller movie, 'cept he's like that in real life. Listen to some music with meaninful lyrics, and good instuments, and stuff made by people with TALENT!! [...]"
2,If you're for Pop,"OK, it's a little harsh, but I did not enjoy this CD. I'm sorry to those that like his music, but I really couldn't catch on. All the songs pretty much show through to his youth, and need of new style and maturity. He is definitely drawn towards N*Sync style. I think he just needs to slow down and leave behind his Disney/Sugar-pop effects.One song I will give credit to is ""Beautiful Soul"". That is a wonderful song, he gives his vocals an extra push, and he reveals the sweeter side. The rest is ultimately geared toward the ""Dirty Pop"" crowd."
1,......................................,"Forget Jesse McCartney. If you want to listen to a genuine artist, keep your ears open for Teddy Geiger. Once Teddy blows up into the music scene, JC will live in his shadow. Just wait."
1,How does trash like this appeal to anyone?,"Doesn't anyone who likes this two-face know that he doesn't give a rats a** who you are or if his lyrics touch you and make you feel great? He just wants your money so that he can get out of his parents suburban home and reach his goal at becoming a millionaire before his middle school buddies do.""music"" like this pollutes everything that is worth listening to. I don't understand how people can sit through anything like this because it is cheap, stale, and worth s*^^.By now some ""Die-hard"" lover of this 4-bit hack of an ""artist"" is probably bubbling with anger and is about to either deem this review inappropriate or unhelpful, like i care.Just want to let everyone who is brainwashed from this know that there is ""REAL"" music out there that most of us who stay away from this can listen to everyday of our lives.Forget about Je""thro"" and move on"
4,the albums cute but...,all i have to say is you can tell that his voice has been digitally remastered!!!!!!
3,JMac could have done better!,"I mean some songs on this album are great! Like Beatiful Soul and She's No you, but The Stuipid Things is horrible! THe lyrics go ""Just charge it on my acountI hope i haven't gone past my limitWith interest rates so swiftNo need to scream and shoutNo doubt is women are from Venus I'd get to them somehow""Lame! The song doesn't make sense at all!She's No You-9/10Beautiful Soul-10/10Get your Shine on-5/10Take your sweet time-8/10Without you 6/10Why don't You kiss her-4/10That was Then 8/10Come to Me 9/10Because You Live-10/10Why is Love So hard to Find-6/10The stupid Things-1/10Best are: She's No You, Beautiful Soul, Take your Sweet Time,That was then, Come to Me, And Because you live!An OK buy..."
2,Major Let Down,I purchased this disc as a 'amazon also recommended'. Usually that works with good result - but I found this disc to be disappointing. The performance wasn't poor - but the syle of music was - well - just too 'girlie' for my taste. I'd highly recommend listening to a few tracks before buying.
2,another example of a cute face but BAD vocals,"Jesse is cute. he's way better than the crack-headed Aaron Carter. Unfortunately, that's it. Jesse's voice is whiny and croaky. You can tell it has been digitally remastered and he may be lip-sinking.""Beautiful Soul"" was ok. ""Come to me"" was discusting. Who wrote these songs? i've heard frogs sound sweeter. ""That was then"" Was nice but his voice masked it. DON'T BUY THE ALBUM UNLESS YOU REALLY REALLY REALLY LOVE HIM!!!!!"
1,Belongs In The Trash,This music is horrible.This guy cannot sing.This garbage should be desroyed.I can't believe some people listen to this girly lookin' fool sing.He is the worst singer ever.He makes you just wanna start throwing things and his voice is so digusting.I can't stand him for the way he turned on his mom.Just read his magazines.He should just take his gay self out and get a hobby that doesn't involve sining.
1,just terrible,Jesse is another aaron carter clone he sucks and so does his album all of his songs are boring and the only song that will carry the album is beautiful soul i recommend you to not buy this album i'ts not worth losing your money
5,Jesse Rocks!!!!!!!,I love this Cd that Jesse Made. I listened to him back in the Dreamstreet days and wasn't really fond of him. But now I LOVE him. There's not one bad song on this CD.1. She's No You 10/10 Great Beat and Lyrics2. Beautiful Soul 10/10 One of the Best3. Get Your Shine On 9/10 Fun to Dance to4. Take Your Sweet Time 10/10 If Love could be like this5. Without U 10/10 Great6. Why Don't You Kiss Her? 10/10 Love This Song7. That Was Then 9/10 A Cool Song8. Come to Me 9/10 Jesse Sings it. Need I Say More!9. What's Your Name 10/10 The Ultimate Best!10. Because You Live 8/10 Not One of My Big Favorites11. Why is Love So Hard To Find 7/10 Not the Best12. The Stupid Things 9/10 Really Really Sweet13. Good Life 10/10 Reminds us to Enjoy Life
1,"sweet, but NO","I'll never understand all this hype about Jesse McCartney. Never found him attractive or liked his acting, and his music? Well...The sound of the songs on the album is okay. A good blend of smooth, uplifting pop/r&b; that radio is missing these days. But a song is more than just itself: a lot of it comes from what the artist delivers. Jesse McCartney has probably THE most WHINY voice I have EVER heard from ANY artist who has gained as much popularity as him. Consequently, the CD is very unpleasant to listen to. Vocally the artist has barely anything. Also, judging from the lyrics to some songs, it sounds like a 13 year old should be singing instead."
1,WOW!,"Worst cd I have ever heard. I heard it, and ti honestly made me wanna go puke. Whoever likes it must be gay, or mentally retarded! His voice is like somebody scratching nails on a chalkboard. It just makes u want to cover your ears. I was so mad! HE should go crawl into a sewer and die. HE is a horrible artist. A PERSON WITH LARYNGITIS COULD SING WAY BETTER THAN THAT!"
4,oh please!,jesse is absolutely fabulous!!! a breath of fresh air!!haters...well you bore me!good music is good music.
1,western civilization is in it's decline,"excuse me, but EW.how the HECK did this pathetic boy ever get famous. he can't sing. he can't act. the only thing going for him is his styled hair. which will probably be passe in a few months anyway. don't buy this cd. you are better off sticking your head in a garbage disposal. and before all you sick, sick groupies go ""don't judge jesse you hater!"" oh, yes i can. i had the unfortunate experience of seeing him live when he opened for simple plan. it was the worst hour of my life. the man can't sing to save his sad, sad life. get a real job jesse. or get singing lessons. or better yet become a hermit so NO ONE WILL HAVE TO SUFFER SEEING AND/OR HEARING YOU AGAIN!!!!!oh yeah... and all you fans... LISTEN TO SOME REAL MUSIC! THIS IS NOT MUSIC! THIS IS POP CRAP!!!"
5,Great Songs - Great Voice,"I was surprised that Jesse McCartney can sing so good, being that he is an actor and so cute:) But all the songs are really good and he sounds excellent. My favorite songs are ""Why Don't You Kiss Her"" and ""Beautiful Soul."" My friends agree and we listen to those over and over. If you like this kind of pop music you'll definitely like this album."
4,Showpiece: Beautiful soul,"Well well, I must say that JM has got very good ability for various subtle styles in a single album. He's even got a nice sentimental + soulful feel to [Why don't you kiss her]. [Come to me ] has a nice build-up heading into the catchy chorus.His showpiece of the entire album is undoubtedly [Beautiful Soul]. It clearly stands out compared to the rest of the pieces. The delivery was almost perfect......energetic, strong, and very clean. I must also say that the accompaniment was extremely well chosen as well.....it was good right from the start. There is no funny feeling of artificiallity with it.Well done, Jesse.I mantain my buy rating."
3,Alright,"I thought this was a good CD. I bought this album December 2004 after hearing ""Beautiful Soul."" There are several really good songs that are pleasant to the ears, but then there's several songs that just sound all the same and they make you beg, ""C'mon Jesse! How 'bout something different?!"" His ballads are probably the most appealing. The tracks I found the best are(ranked):1.Because You Live(It's as if he melted his heart out on this one)2.The Stupid Things(Not as effective as ""Because You Live,"" but still pleasant to the ears)3.Take Your Sweet Time(Sure, it can be a little cheesy, but it's also a nice song to just relax to)4.Good Life(This is the best upbeat song, just 'cause it's easy going and he sounds really comfortable singing this)"
1,maybe im the one with issues......,"but i dont find him that attractive.and i know that no one likes him for just his music, and that it is more for his looks that seems to appeal to his ten year old fanbase.but personally, i'd be less susprised if guys were attracted to him because of his extremely girly nature."
2,Just because you can 'act' doesn't mean you can sing,"As my title explains; if you are fortunate enough to be in a TV Show (which isn't even all that good), why should it mean you get to have songs on the chart if you aren't all that good? I think some of these songs aren't too bad (my niece has this), but he's not worth all of the hype. The songs are repetitive and his voice isn't great in range. Quite frankly, in my opinion this album would never have gotten released if it weren't for his acting job and the teeny boppers opinion that he is even somewhat remotely good looking."
2,catchy crap,"Obviously Jesse's managment has it all worked on - hes a singer turned actor...or is it the other way around? Either way, they've pulled the right strings and acquired Jesse a fanbase of screaming teenage girls. I admit I do like the song 'Beautiful Soul"", as well as a few other ballads amongst the mix... although many of the tracks seem to propose that Jesse is read to be the next Justin Timberlake. And I can't believe they made a ballad called 'The Stupid Things.' Just hearing the name of the song makes me run for the Eject button on my cd player."
1,"I would have given it 0, but there was none in the ratings.","This cd is complete trash. The truth is that he is never going to become famous. He is the epitomy of the end of male pop. Aaron carter was first, then this idiot. What is the world coming to? Is it the new craze for teenage boys to record cds? I cant see how anyone likes such music. He has a bad voice. I dont hate pop, but stuff like this makes me gag, and maybe vomit. Someone give this boy a slap around the face, and a reality check. He will never become famous. NEVER! NEVER I TELL YOU!!!"
2,Why Buy?,"Jesse McCartney is another version of Aaron Carter. Jessejust writes these cheesy songs thinking that he'll be Mr. Superstar. Though if you are a big fan of Aaron Carter I reccomend you to buy Jesse's CD. I made my mistake of buying Jesse's CD, don't let yourself make a mistake"
1,If I could I would give him 0 stars.,ALL GIRLS LIKE HIM FOR HIS LOOKS AND THAT IS IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!how can u think he is the best singer on the face of the earth. something is wrong with all u people who think that. He cannot sing. There are so many better singers than him. This is not anywhere near the best album either. Probably closer to the worst.
1,I HAVEN'T LISTENED TO THIS SO ONE STAR DOESNT COUNT,"This dude is graduating from my highschool(Ardsley, NY) next month and I find that cool. I graduated a few years back. It is interesting to see a famous person graduate from there. The timeS they are-a-changn."
1,Nice Music (Only if all of it was his),"songs are nice but the track come To me Is Almost an Exact copy of Plus One's ""Let Me be the One"" Nice way to be original but the song are great"
1,um.....ugh...,"Where do I start? First off, all the people I know that love Jesse McCartney only love him for his looks. But personally, I think he's not that cute.Second, his voice is sometimes girly, sounds whiney, just plain ugh. His single ""Beautiful Soul"" is overplayed way too much on the radio and I absolutely HATE that song. When I tell my friends when they're listening to ""Beautiful Soul"" that I hate the song, they say,""OMG! How can you not like this song?"" But they're the kind of people that don't listen to the radio and just rely on burning other people's CD's. But I listen to the radio, and this song is WAAAAAAAY overplayed.Jesse McCartney has no talent, and is just famous because of what he looks like. Overall, I HATE JESSE MCCARTNEY."
1,Here comes the witch...,"The witch is dead! Jesse is going to be murdered soon. Rejoice! Just kidding kiddos! He's still alive.He's kind of sleazy though with his moongoose always hanging out of his trousers. Just kidding baby dolls.But really I recommend this CD if you are gay, a high school girl who has no friends and a face FULL OF ACNE or just plain musically challenged!"
5,Jesse McCartney ( Canada),"I highly recommend people to buy Jesse McCartney's CD 'Beautiful Soul'. Canada needs some new acts in town, We have Hilary Duff exploding big, now why not give Jesse McCartney who's on the same label as Hilary a chance.McCartney, is well worth your listening time.x0x0-Kris"
3,A couple good songs,"There are a couple decent songs on the album - one in particular I really like. The album isn't worth full price to me, but I bought it because I got the entire album for about the same price as if I had downloaded just the ones I wanted electronically."
5,Work of a Total Hottie Singer,"I love this CD. It is so cool. Jesse, great work. If you love R&B and pop, then you will love this CD. Jesse said that he has been working on this CD for about 2 years and those 2 years paid off. Great piece of material. I recommend this CD to anyone!!!! So what are you waiing on???? GO GET IT!!!!!!!!"
5,Alterna-whiners go somewhere else,"White Stripes and those bands are cool and good at what they do but I just don't get why their fans need to come here to bash really good r&b influenced pop music. Jesse's for real (and unlike some of the people that post here, he's also sincere) and this album's really good. Check it out!"
1,This stuff sucks!,"I'm so sick and tired of hearing about this little whining girly boy with no talent named Jesse McCarntey, he's got to be the most overrated, overhyped singer ever. His singing sucks, his music sucks, it's so irriating to listen to. I don't care about Jesse McCartney. I don't care about pop music, it's all the same whiny, immature, girly bullcrap. And if you don't like my review, then I don't care about you either. I'm so glad that people are finally starting to come to their senses and write bad reviews on Jesse McCarntey, becasue he deserves it. He doesn't deserve any fame, he doesn't deserve any popularity, and he isn't orignal, because he's exactly like that other fruitcake Aaron Carter. For some awesome, talented, hardcore musicianship then buy some CD's from the bands System of a Down, Pantera, As I Lay Dying, Killswitch Engage, Lamb of God, and Unearth. But overral, I HATE Jesse McCarntey."

1,Absolutely Terrible!!!,Jesse Mccartney is really a good looking guy but he sings like a girl. I even prefer Lindsay Lohan's songs than his songs. Beautiful Soul and Because You Live were the only 2 tracks that I liked. I really regret buying his album. This is one of the worst albums ever!
1,Total fake,"OK, I'm sorry, but this guy totally sucks. He can't sing for his life, his voice is so whiney. The lyrics are so shallow. It's so obvious that he's only famous because he's Paul McCartney's son. And yet there are idiots who buy this. My advice: don't waste your money on this fake."
1,Hey its Aaron Carters clone!,Ok i advise anyone who matters not to buy any stupied Jesse McCartney crap because its just as bad as Aaron Carter and he is a pretty boy...why would u want to give a kid like that money for his lipsyncing! Yes Jesse we know your secet and are going to spread the word. Jesse is actully Aaron Carter in disguise because he is not very self confident about his looks...either way Jesse stinks and Aaron stink.....
1,Jesse..what have you done to all good people?,"Jesse..You MIGHT be able to act..but honestly,dude,don't sing.My radio started playing your song and said ""Heelpppp mee!!!""....Of all the teenage crossovers Lindsay Lohan,Mandy Moore,and Jennifer Lopez have spawned the most talent.Jesse,you are ugly,not talented,stupid,and did I meantion ugly.Ya look like a friggen girl!Kelly Osbourne is better than you!That's all I have to say."
1,Talent?,"Is this what is labeled talent now a days? If so, that is truly sad. Jesse McCartney has no vocal range what so ever, and his songs are not well thought out at all. This CD is definitely not what I expected it to be. This album is not worth the money at all.Personally, I perfer Stevie Brock over Jesse McCartney."
4,I love this Album!,"I think that Jesse McCartney really exceeded my expectations with this album. I was expecting his sound to be like Dreamstreet's sound, a sound which is getting old in my opinion. I think that Jesse really performed songs that any person of any age could enjoy, not just 9-13 year old girls (even though they still do enjoy this album. I should know, I'm one of them.) I think that in Beautiful Soul that he really is setting the good example for kids that looks don't really matter and what matters is that you have a Beautiful Soul. I also enjoyed Get Your Shine On.The reason that I gave this album a 4 is because the album has it's catchy songs, which we all know, such as Beautiful Soul. I think some of the songs on his cd kind of sound the same, but I still love them. It may get a bit old after a while for some people.I personally think that there are great things to come from Jesse."
2,The best CD ever?,"C'mon now. I saw in a few reviews that this cd is evidentally the best CD ever made. Obviously I had to give it a listen. I would probably put it at about #475,934 of cds that I have heard. Jesse is what Jesse is, a poster boy with nothing to say. Other people write most of his music and the Lizzie McGuire crowd eats it up because he is pretty. If a 284 pound kid with zits and Joe Paterno glasses named Chuck Zubcrotch put out this disc, no one would even pay attention to it. No one would go to his concert, no one would feed him hot dogs and no one would be wanting to give it a hug. Jesse is the system and you people are eating it up. To call this the best cd ever is the funniest thing I've ever seen. Go pick up a copy of ""Life's Rich Pageant"" by REM or ""Little Earthquakes"" by Tori Amos and listen to how intelligent artists put together an album. This is chucky cheese fluff."
4,Great CD for the Tweens!,My daughters (ages 7 and 9) love Jesse and they love this CD! Their favorite songs are the up tempo tunes and they know all the words to every song. I've even put a few of them on my ipod!
3,"cuh dear JESSE ,cuhdeaR","i HAVE NOT BOUGHT THE ALBUM, BUT JUST FROM THE SAMPLES, THE ALBUM SOUNDS SEMI IRITATING. hIS VOICE HAS LITTLE CHANGED SINCE HIS DAYS I9N DREAMSTREET AND AT SOME POINTS HE SOUNDS LIKE ALITTLE BITCH. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE BOY HAS SOME GOOD SONGS. BUT HIS VOICE STAYS AT THE SAME POINT THROUGH OUT ALL HIS SONGS IT WOULD BE NICE TO HEAR A LITTLE FALSETO OR A LITTLE BASS EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE THIS IS ONE OF HOSE CD'S THAT CAN NOT BE LISTED TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN DUE TO THESE COMPNENETS"
2,He is an ugly poop with blonde hair,I do not like his ugly voice.. i use poopola seed in burrito it good. Me go bed.
4,A Great album for Pop-lovers,"I am not a fan of Jesse McCartney and never will, but I like his music. These days, the music industry is dominated by hip-hop and R n'b. Everyone is doing it. There is just not enough musicians doing pop anymore. This album is great for those who loves pop music. Most of his songs are addictive. You just can't get enough of it. His voice is not that great, but it is not bad either. At first, I thought that he will sing like Aaron Carter, but he isn't. His voice is almost out-of-tune many times, and I was hoping to caught his sings out-of-tune, but I think the management has done something to his voice, so that it is not too terrible to listen to.Songs like ""She No You"" ""That was then"" ""Because You live"" ""What's your name"" are great, but I think ""the Stupid Mistake"" is just very bad lyrically. As overall, this album is a must have album for pop-lovers. Even though I am not a fan of Jesse, but I can't wait for his second album"
3,I recommend this CD strongly.,"He don't have good voice for singing and also he don't have any ability for his music. Because of his management, he can sing. His music is made by several composers. Anyway he is so handsome that many girls may buy this CD. I think that this cd don't have qulity for collecting. Later, you will regret if you buy this Cd. This music is just kid pop among many ordinary songs"
2,it okay.,"this cd is okay. nothing special. nothing new. nothing deep. its just ok. i have some favorites in this cd. but its nothing compared to other artists like DRAKE BELL, who actually put effort into their albums. but jesses ok though. well one jesse fan wrote a review saying that jesse sings good in this album but doesnt sound good live. well that tells you something.jeez some artist these days are getting so boring and stale.i really reccommend DRAKE BELL. hes a very refreshing and amazing artist. you should check him out."
1,"Ummm, yeah","Jesse McCartney sucks. Listen to one song and you will realize it...Once again, Jesse is just another good example of a preppy white boy who wishes he was black, whose jealous of Michael Jackson's singing and dancing talent, and wishes he could be Justin Timberlake and Aaron Carter, so do not fall for the hype."
4,Jesse's Beautiful Soul,"Four words say it all: Jesse McCartney is AMAZING! His soulful and smooth voice indicates the range that he can hit. There's also a lot of potential hits on here, including the sweet mid-tempo song, ""Because You Live"", the RnB-tinged ""Without You"", and the soothing ""Take Your Sweet Time"". Jesse also branches out into songwriting, having written 4 of the 12 songs. (13 total if you count the bonus track, ""Good Life""). ""Come to Me"" is actually a cover song originally sang by Christian group plusONE. However, Jesse's version contains changed lyrics and a new title (""Come to Me"" instead of ""Let Me Be the One"").The only bad thing is that a few annoying songs are on here (""What's Your Name"" and ""Get Your Shine On"".). Other than that, it's a great cd!"
4,Samantha Fox's forever fantastic romantic-album,"I like most ""True Devotion"" which used to be one of my childhood's favourites. This song is still one of the most romantic and touching songs I ever heard. All the other songs are also one of the best ones that the 80s ever offered. Really nice!!"
5,1987 best album I bought,"in 1987 when I were 19, I bought this album and fall in love with it immediatly.it's amaing when I first heard ""Naugjty Girls Need Love too"".the beats so uptempo in that time and Sam did a very great job.Get this album, if you were 80's kids."
4,"Her best album (and the best cover photo, too)","Samantha Fox's second album is (at least in my opinion) her best. In addition to ""Naughty Girls Need Love Too,"" the album also features ""I Surrender (To The Spirit Of The Night)"" and ""True Devotion""(arguably her best song ever)."
5,The Heritage - romance at its best,"This is one of my most favorite books. When I read it last a couple of weeks ago, it finally started to fall apart (paperback). But hardback copies are available used, so I was able to replace it easily. Here's the story. A young American in Ireland to visit relatives falls in love with a beautiful young woman on a train. They consumate their sudden love on a Ferry boat, a leg of his jouney. She had never revealed her name. In the morning he finds her gone with no way of tracing her. He finds her under incredible circumstances, but burdened by her guilt over their illicit interlude, she refuses to acknowledge or return his love. When she is found to be pregnant, he is unable to claim his child. The author felt duty bound to include historical politics which is irrelevant to the plot. Filter (skim over) the political letters, and you have a delightful romance. Awesome."
3,Mixed thoughts,"The animation in this is beautiful and the music is very good - it reminds me of a Broadway musical in style. What bothers me about it is how it deviates from the Bible account of God's deliverance of his people from Egypt. It also adds much to the Bible account that is not there. For example, Moses is a young man in this whereas he should haave been 80. Aaron did not go with him to Pharoah as the Bible tells us; instead they send zipporah with Moses. The boyhood friendship between Ramses and Moses is completely fabricated - it's not in the Bible at all. I think it would have been so wonderful if they had stuck to the facts. The truth of what really happened is so much more exciting. By the way, my 3-year old will not watch it - she is too upset by the babies being thrown in the river. May be more appropriate for older children!"
2,"SOngs, songs and more songs...","Even with the stellar cating providing voices for the characters (reaching almost perfection) this film fails, because probably Katzenberger wanted to beat Disney in their own terrain. So, what he did? Filled the movie with songs and forgot about the history. The result is a boring film (with high technical quality, of course)."
2,Prince of Egypt,"I recently watched this film with my daughter who is two. Ithought it was ok but there were too many songs. I thought the storywas not true to the real story in the bible and really, I don't think I would purchase this film. I collect Disney and I believe Disney would have done a better job at making this film."
2,Poor quality,"""~Found the movie very boring considering I was expecting it to be better than 'The Ten Commandments'. LionKing should get 100 stars."
1,Not for children,Am I the only one who thinks this movie is not appropriate for a child? I do not want my son to fear God and think it is ok to kill in his name. That some people are good because they believe in him and other are not and have to be eliminated because they do not? I have never cried more seeing a film than this one and find it to be exactly what I do not want my child to see.
3,What I expected,"Going into this movie I was hoping that it would not be preachy, and would be as impartial as a biblical movie can get. To this extent I was pleased, the movie was translated excellently, and I didn't leave the theater with the thought that God was being rammed down my throat. I happen to like God, but no preachiness) I enjoyed this movie, but I wasn't left with any lasting impression, I probably would never see it again. Not because it was bad, just because once was enough. I wasn't moved but i wasn't displeased. It was worth the price of admission, but not a repeat viewing. As far as animation, Dreamworks did a respectable job, but aside from the wonderful parting of the Red Sea scene, they still have a way to go to catch up with Disney's ability. (Check out Tarzan) Hopefully Dreamworks animations keeps improving, because they are off to a promising start. To wrap up, a Good film, but not one that will captivate you and cause you to watch over and over."
4,Love this movie,This was my second time seeing this movie. The biblical story of Moses has always been one of my favorites. The Prince of Egypt delivers in every area. I really think this was a great idea to bring the story to life in a way that young children would understand it and enjoy it.
5,Best movie of the year,"The Prince of Egypt was a trilling, great for all ages sort of movie. I'm thirteen and I loved it. A little bit was off but still, worth seeing. I hope that they'll do some more movies based on the Bible."
3,Good movie,"While this is a nice family movie, the producers could have done a better job of incorporating more accuracy (from the biblical perspective) into the movie. For example, Moses didn't run away from Egypt after he killed the guard. The fact that he was Hebrew came to light and he was thrown into slave labor with his own people, THEN the queen noticed him and requested that he come to her suite. When he decided not to come back to the Egyptian family, he was THEN forced to cross a desert. He THEN came back after his meeting with God. Too many inaccuracies, but overall solid family movie."
4,Great for kids,This film is great for kids and was a real step in the right direction for Dreamworks animation.
4,First class attempt at competing for Disney's crown,"A wonderful adaptation of the biblical story of the Ten Commandments, sans Heston. The music, animation and scenes are nothing less than spectacular. The cast of voices is like nothing ever put together. A must for the library. The DVD version has great-added features."
5,Excellent faith building portrayal of the Biblical account.,"Though not 100% accurate, brings new insight into the feelings that Moses must have felt. Excellent music as well."
5,Best Animated Movie in Ages,"When seeing ""The Prince of Egypt"" for the first time, I was brought to tears, a sensation I had not experienced for some time while watching one of Hollywood's latest blockbusters. The story of Moses and his exodus was brought to life through this tale of love and miracles, and I have never been so moved by an animated film. I was impressed by the subtle blending of both the Christian and Jewish faiths and touched by the portrayal of these biblical heros as real feeling people. The soundtrack is both moving and exciting to listen to, while reflecting actual Hebrew musical styles and textures. The animation was incredible and I was in awe of the gorgeous landscapes, plague interpretations and river scenes. This movie was a stunning masterpiece and I commend Dreamworks for their acheivement. My only complaint is that this movie didn't receive an Academy Award Nomiation for best picture."
5,Great movie,"This movie has always been a favorite of ours. Wonderful quality. I highly recommend this movie for others, especially those with kids"
3,Cecil B. DeMille Has Nothing to Worry About,"Maybe I am one of the few who found ""The Prince of Egypt"" to be insufferably long. True enough, it is only 90 minutes but it seems longer than DeMille's four-hour classic ""The Ten Commandments."" The pacing is tremendously slow with only spurts of ""life"" in the film. The animation is awesome, though, with a magnificent scene where fire rains down upon Egyptian buildings and monuments. Voicing is adequate with Val Kilmer making a decent Moses. The songs and the musical score are not memorable. Even the radio-friendly duet from Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey is rather bland. Perhaps, I have become accustomed to the Disney blend of pathos, humor, sympathetic heroes and sinister villians, and outstanding musical cues/songs, that I missed these in this film. Spielberg and company didn't really get the job done this time. Maybe, if they'd thrown in a dancing ""tablet""..."
3,Prince of Egypt,"The animation was beautiful, and the music was beautiful. I feel this movie is for an adult audience, and not children."
5,another view,"To all the reviews I've read on this movie, I would like add only one thing. I thought the idea that Moses & Ramesis were close brothers added a very personal & realistic touch to the story. In all my years of having heard the story & seem the different movie adaptations, this close relationship between the two rivals added a very fresh look on an otherwise much-told story. It gave the movie the classic element of personal conflict, and made the movie into more than just another Bible story. Who wouldn't be moved to see the heartbreak that Moses endured in the movie when he had to oppose the brother he loved, now the Pharoah of Egypt? Or to see the conflict Ramesis endured when his beloved brother chose to follow his God rather than return to Egypt? It is a story of people & relationships as well as a story of Biblical teaching."
4,Good Christian kid's movie,"I find the movie a great teaching tool and the story very touching. It helped me, and the grandchildren, to look at Moses from a different perspective and appreciate where he came from and all that he went through. I'd forgotten that the animation was so plain, but the story and sound effects more than made up for it."
2,"Pretty to look at, but...zzz",The story is pretty dry and the songs arn't that catchy-they just sound like a bad mix of disney and andrew lloyd webber. Try Yellow Submarine for yours kids instead-you can at least enjoy watching that with them!
2,Totally Disappointed!,"I was anticipating the release of this movie for a long time. When it finally was released on video I went right out and bought it, thinking it would be an excellent way to teach my children about Moses. Was I ever disappointed!!!! It was not accurate at all. Where was Aaron? He was with Moses throught the miracles and wonders and they never even showed him much. There was so much that was inaccurate that I wanted to return the movie back to the store and get my money!!! The ending was even more disappointing. Bible it was and didn't rent it before purchasing it. I had thought if the reviews are good then it would be excellent for my children. Even Christian programs were raving about it. The animation is awesome, but that is all that is any good."
2,Movie Great DVD Lousy,We like to have language options on our films. There are no language options other than English on the DVD. Even the subtitles only come in English.
3,God has found His mouth on earth,"God has found His mouth and from His mighty lips between the folds of his magnificent beard comes the voice of Moses through the many obviously religious and God fearing artists who conspired to bring His Word to the swinish hordes cowering in the shadow of Satan666 who probably didn't enjoy this film. Having said that, it's a bit slow."
2,Acuracy,"I watch this and thought that it was pretty good. If anyone wishes to buy this as a bible lesson to teach kids, don't buy it. It is absolutely not acurate. All it is entertaining. After I've watch it, it made me thought of ""that stupid Egyptians! They have no compassion at all. After the jews saved their life and they put them into slavery.""I belive that any filming industry who wishes to do a bilble story should do it exactly as the scriptual says and not try to edit the stories for the benifit of actracting people to see it. It is wrong to do this."
2,BRILLIANT TECHNICAL SIDE; BORING SONGS....,"The songs in this animated picture are the most exxagerated I've ever heard. IT is like if a character in a movie, for example, couldn't simple ask for a couple of coffee: he would have to do so singing ""please, give me a cup of coffee, because I love you and life is beautiful and coffee is good for health.."" Blergh. The technical aspect is brilliant, but the history is marginally told, the influence in children (if any) is questionable, because you have to have some age to get to understand this picture. Anyway, anything coming from Spielberg doesn't surprise me (although Katzenberge, obvioulsy, was the mastermind behind this project) because Steven only wants money."
4,New look at the classic Bible story,"Most of us are familiar with how stories can become ""Disney-ified"" to make endings happier and what not. The story of Moses receives similar treatment in this retelling of the tale, and covers much of Moses' life, from his birth to the parting of the sea to help the Jews escape. Lots of stuff in the movie is not mentioned in the book, and the plagues are not given much attention, so you may enjoy this movie, but do NOT expect this to be an accurate account of the Bible tale."
4,Great video,This film was well done and is children friendly. My family and I now enjoy this film regularly. Excellent choice.
5,I still get chills!,"When I first saw this movie in the theaters, I thought it was absolutely wonderful. The songs, the characters, the special effects, the cast, and especially the story were breathtaking. I've owned the movie since it came out to the public and everytime I watch it I still am in awe. The music is so powerful and moving that I get goosebumps everytime I hear it (no kidding!). I am also Jewish and to actually SEE the story, especially for younger viewers, makes it easier to understand. I thought Dreamworks did a fabulous job portraying one of the most popular stories of the Old Testament"
5,"Terrific animation, character development","I applaud Jeffrey Katzenberg & Dreamworks for making this movie. The insight into the characters was refreshing and the animation was spectacular. I am so grateful to see the amazing talents of the animators directed toward giving us a sense of the glory and awesomeness of God. I am so tired of seeing such talent wasted on glorifying the occult, the crude and the just plain evil."
5,Move Over Disney,"I took my little nephew to see ""Prince Of Egypt"" the day after Christmas, and we both totally enjoyed this movie. For those who give this movie only 1 star you better look at it again. This really reflects and is close to the story in the Bible. For those who haven't seen this, I suggest you put this on your must rental or must buy list. (Just in case you're wondering, this movie is #1 on my list of movies to own.)"
4,Dont have to be religious to love this movie!,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though I am not religious! The music in this movie is also excellent! I would recommend it!
5,Classic,This movie is great. It often leaves me wondering what life was like back in those days. I would have loved to see all the miracles performed front seat.
5,"THE PRINCE OF EGYPT, a true family film","This animated film is one of the last remainig family friendly films in America. I have personally seen this film at least ten times at theatres all over. This movie contains very little sexual innuindo, in fact the only thing that is sexual about the whole film is the way that one of the characters dresses (Zippora, Mosses' wife). Also this film is very close to the Biblical story, although it has some artistic licences taken on it. The music is FABULOUS, the opening number will keep you in comatose for so long that you will not even notice the time flying by. A definate 2 thumbs up!"
4,Very powerful movie. Amazing graphix,Totaly mind boggling. the artistry that is seen in The prince of Egypt is amazing. However the story line is kind of hard to follow. It could have been more fluid.
1,itunes,"I would not have bought this movie had I realised that I could not sync it to itunes. For this reason only, I will not be buying any more movies from amazon. I will only use itunes for this purpose."
1,What a waste!,"Time, money, and energy - all wasted on creating and watching 'Prince of E-was-gypt'. My church teaches that waste is a sin - how ironic."
5,You just don't get better than this!,"I am a very honest person, and I would be darned if you thought I was lying when I say that this is the best movie I have ever seen. It is absolutely impossible not to get caught up with this movie; in fact you'll probably watch it as a reminder of those things that you just need knocked into you every once in a while. Trust me, the score is great, the story comes from the best book on Earth (and doesn't sway too far either), and I can guarantee you'll love it."
5,"An ispirational, poignant movie experience","I've heard and read the Moses story since I was a child in Sunday School, but never before had I understood the strong family bond Moses would have had with his adopted Egyptian family. This movie gives insight into Moses' struggle with his own place and purpose in the world and with the conflict of choosing sides between his birth family and adopted family. I thought the movie was well done. The minor differences from the biblical text were negligible in comparison to the moving portrayal of the story. I think it's wonderful that our children are encouraged to have hope and to believe that our prayers are answered long before we see the results. I would love to know the English translation to the delightful Hebrew lyrics begun by the children and joined by the nation during the exodus. Does anyone know where I might find them?"
5,finally on DVD,"I got this DVD for my daughter who loves it and we could never find it in a DVD until just weeks before her birthday. We have the VHS from many years ago, needless to say she was thrilled. The packaging was good and so was the case. Got it rather quickly too. Price was good."
3,Good Guide for discussion,I enjoyed the DVD over all. The songs and graphics were great and do understand that some of the information was changed to adjust to the screen. I however did not get why some information was intentionally changed. For instance Moses did not go to see Pharaoh with his wife but rather his brother Aaron. Also Pharaoh and his army perished in the Red Sea. After the movie I recommend a discussion so that the biblical facts are confirmed. We don't want our children minds changed from what's in the Bible.
2,"Fairly Valiant Effort, but not Disney Par","Also, let me point out if I had the choice, it would be more of a 2.5...not just a 2. Bravo to Dreamworks for trying TOO HARD. Animation was inconsistent, although at sometimes fluid. The CGI was GREAT as a 3-D work, but it was AWFUL as a piece of traditional animation. The red sea didn't blend in at all with the normal animation and stuck out just as badly as the CGI in Anastasia did. The film was overall mostly enjoyable, there were 2 good songs, the rest I cringed all the way through. Worth a rent, but not worth the buy I'd say."
2,movie is scratch,the movie was the one i wanted and it was working fine but the end of the dvd is scratch at the end so we were not able to watch the end.
3,An OK DVD,"The DVD is ok. The animation is colorful but too dark at times. I am showing it to my Wednesday night children's Bible study class, we have learned about Moses up to the first Passover. The movie does a good job of covering the first Passover but it skips over details about the 2 - 8th plague. I wish they had shown some scenes of Pharoah first saying that the Israelites could go, and then changing his mind after the plagues were lifted by God. The 9th plague is portrayed fairly well also.I am not sure if the Pharoah was raised as Moses' brother, it doesn't make that too plain in the Bible. That could've been the case which makes the story more interesting. Although I do feel if that had been the case, then the Bible would've mentioned the irony of it. But it's still an excellent lesson of God's people and how God worked with them and through them.Thanks Amazon.com for getting the movie to me so quickly!"
4,"Sure, it was good.","It was good. I'm extremely sensitive to people dying, people being unhappy, confused, or just those lines (Good bye Brother-Moses), so I was on the verge of tears every 5 minutes. What I didn't like is this: The movie ends with Moses bringing down the 10 Commandments. If I'm not mistaken, the Hebrews were worshipping another god at that time. That's kinda stupid for a religion movie."
4,The Prince of Egypt,"Although some of the facts were lost in the making, I thought that is was a good film overall. If an individual wants to know the true facts of what happened, I would strongly encourage them to read the Bible(KJV)."
3,"A piece of art, but with weak points","The animation is pure art, the best I've ever seen, but there are weak points: .) The music: Film music is essential, but to couterfeit a strong story with high symbolic content with this kitsch muzak is beyond my grasp. If people can't take the old testament without disneyfication, they should stick to Bambi. .) The dialogs: Unbearable cliche rule: 'My life has been a lie !' 'They can take your freedom (!), but they cannot take your faith (?)' The last blather would have been nice, if they've shown a golden calf, but they did not.I cannot understand why Dreamworks had to dull down this story. The animation is pure art, the best"
4,Daughter loves it!,"When your child requests a gymnastics mat for Christmas you are elated that you no longer have to worry about her smashing her head through your living room floor but also a little perplexed about what to buy. This mat is very thick and easily stored. It is not heavy so she can, with a little effort, move it around the playroom by herself. There is velcro on one end for storage purposes, I believe, but I wish there were velcro on both ends so I could be sure it would not move around on top of the floor. That is the only drawback. Easily cleaned and well-made."
5,Chromium GTF for Diabetic,"While I am no doctor, since I started taking this, eating right, taking Iodarol (Iodine), and exercising my diabetes is under control."
3,Good Book,Interesting book. Not a very easy read but I wasn't expecting that. I'm interested in the topic so I enjoyed it.
3,amazing,It's amazing how some of the basic principles of nursing are still true today as they were in the 1800's and early 1900's
4,Good history,"I had heard mentioned in other things that Florence Nightingale was critical of others, but reading her own writing confirmed it. I did love that she and I agree that the ill can have their spirits greatly lifted by the visit of a baby. I call it baby therapy!"
1,Not what I thought,A bit dissapointed - Was hoping to read about some outrageous incidents and fascinating cures and treatments.I was a bit dissapointed.
4,Good Stuff,"I bought this Cd for ""Wishing"" and ""Space Age Love Song"". I wasn't really sure what to expect from the unfamiliar tracks on here. To my surprise they weren't that bad. In fact, I have shown a liking towards ""Telecommunication"" and ""Transfer Affection"" among some others. If you think AFOS have only one hit I recommend you pick up this Cd and discover that though called one-hit wonders they really deliver more than one hit."
4,CLASSIC 80'S SYNTH-BASED SPACEY DANCE POP MUSIC !!!,"This collection of hits displays the great and catchy sci-fi imagery this band captures in their songs with superb synth and guitar line hooks. Gems like ""I Ran"" and ""Space Age Love Song"" still sound fresh today!Absolutely fun, sci-fi dance-pop music at its best! I personally enjoy Paul Reynold's guitar line hooks. His guitar sound is so energizing. I just hope ""Listen"", the Flock's second album, comes out on CD soon. Though it has the greatest hits ""Wishing"", ""Nightmares"", ""Transfer Affection"" and ""(It's Not Me) Talking"", this great album also contains lost gems such as ""Traveller"", ""Over The Border"" and the fantastic ""Electrics"" where the absolutely catchy, talented guitar playing of Reynolds soars with such power in one of his best efforts."
4,Recommended Hits Collection,"I have a lot of respect for A Flock Of Seagulls. Duran Duran and them churned out some of the best music of the '80s. I've always thought that A.F.O.S. did a nice job of blending equals parts of synthesizer and guitar in their music without one instrument overkilling the other. This hits package is really good, and their best songs are on here. ""Space Age Lovesong"" is a classic song. ""D.N.A."" is one of my favorite instrumentals. A.F.O.S. definitely made their mark compared to a lot of synth bands of the '80s. Recommended."
4,This great band......,".....has made some classic 80's synthpop and are a sadly overlooked group. But don't kid yourself you're getting the best of A Flock Of Seagulls here, their albums, especially the one with The More You Live are excellent. You'll miss some of their best work by settling for this hit's comp. I can't help wondering where they are now......?"
4,Lawnmower Cover,"This is an excellent lawnmower cover - it is a bit tight on my mower, which is small. It is an excellent alternative to the plastic type. It also has a drawstring to tighten it up and prevent the rain from getting on the mower."
1,not worth buying at all,"the picture will show it fits over the lawn mower completely, well unless you have a small push type lawn mower for some reason, do not waste your money on this. It will only come 1/2 way up to the handle after wrapping it around the base part..so dissappointed."
4,Pretty Good,"It looks exactly as it does in the pictures. I was expecting a little thicker material, but it seems durable enough. Just be careful if its going to rub against anything sharp or get caught directly in a very strong wind storm (probably 40+ mph winds as it could cause damage) I leave my lawn motor on my back patio which has a cover that blocks quite a bit of wind and it seems to hold up just fine."
3,Thin,Thin material shredded after a storm. Not durable enough for outdoors. A heavier gauge material would be worth the money.
4,Very Nice Cover,"Fits pretty well. I have a Craftsman lawnmower and it does fit good. My mower has the large rear wheels so it it a bit snug, but works just the same. It even stayed on during our very high Santa Ana winds in in So. Cal. kept the fire ashes off it as well...."
4,Idea for the single ladies,I just luv my electric mulching mower.... it is a wonderful convenience and so easy to clean....no complaints what so ever....
4,works well,"I bought this for a Black & Decker electric mower. I dont have a garage or shed for it, but this cover keeps it dry and clean. Its pretty easy to get on or off with the elastic and can wrap all the way under all 4 wheels."
3,Lawn mower cover,Classic Accessories Black Lawn Mower CoverThe cover fits over my electric mower quite nicely. It is a little awkward to get on at first. The material cover is quite thin and appears as if it would tear easily. I wouldn't trust this cover to keep my lawn mower dry outside but it is fine for keeping it covered in the garage.
4,Lawn Mower Cover,It is nice to be able to cover my new mower. This one is a little hard for me to get on but I have arthritis so that could be part of the problem. Thanks Amazon.com
4,So far so good,"I bought this cover to shield my lawnmower from the elements. I keep it under my deck so it isn't really getting the full effects of what nature can do, but so far I am happy with it. For the price you are getting a pretty well built item. It acts just like advertised. It is a little tight trying to completely cover the wheels. I am happy with this product and really happy with the price."
4,good product,this product fits my sears craftsman mower pretty well. you have to make sure it is around everything otherwise major rain will fill the top and push the cover over. i keep mine under a deck. material seems to be strong but not sure about the winter months.update 05/06/2012 I still use this thing. Well worth the price.
4,Works!,It fits though a little snuggly over our craftsman lawn mower and keeps it dry so it doesn't have to take up tons of space in our garage.
3,Good Songs but not a full album to me.,Maybe i would appreciate this album more if i heard it when it actually was released in 1989. I also know this album has a lot of history in it but I cant give it a good review for the fact it isn't a full CD. Good songs are dope fiend beat. Those are the only good songs to me. Mack attack and little girls are good. I understand that this album went platinum but as a true too short fan I find this to be one of his weaker albums as a whole. It has 2 good classic hits which is why it gets 3/5. For every Too Short review check out my other reviews
5,Another Early Classic,"Classic album, many classic albums dropped around this time, Straight Outta Compton, No One Can Do It Better, Boomin Words From Hell, Great Adventures Of Slick Rick, Paid In Full, etc. Too $hort is very underrated rapper, and this is one of his finest works. His beats are just incredible. In songs such as Mack Attack, there are some nice instrumental parts to the song, which shows off how good the beat is. His storytelling is incredible, one of the greatest storytelling MC's ever. Bottom line is, get this album if u havent already, its a timeless classic, all tracks are the best but my favorite is Mack Attack."
5,good sh*t,this cd was good cuz every one was rappin about sellin drugs and gangbangin and $hort came out and talked about pimpin so it was cool.
1,Powdeer Magazine,"Magazine was ordered Dec 11, 2011 as a CHRISTMAS gift. My grandson has not received his first copy yet! The explanation given to us was the mail labels had already been printed and he will receive his first issue September 2012. NUTS! I can buy his magazine at Walmart!"
4,Great cable; way too long for a car.,"This is an excellent cable. Very flexible even in cold weather and a solid feel to the mini plugs. BUT, does it need to be over six feet long ?Maybe, ......if you're in the rear seat of a mini-van but a three foot cable would be more than enough for a car. Thus, four stars."
4,Monster,"I use this everyday to connect my ipod to my vehicles AUX jack. One side goes into the headphone jack and the other into the AUX jack on your vehicle, it's that easy. And Monster cables always give you a better sound."
3,"Good, NOT Great","This is typical Monster quality, but if , like me you want this to plug into a glove box or center console aux. port, just remember it is 6 feet long! Only thing i could do without. Sound quality is good, but truthfully, I bought a Skosche kit with several adaptors etc; in it, and it had a patch cord and it is only 1-2 ft long, and I really cant tell any difference in sound quality...and that kit was 5 bucks less than the monster cable."
1,Didn't Do What I Wanted,"I own a 2005 Toyota RAV4 and 2007 Sienna. The issue I have in these two cars is a high pitched line noise (which increases with higher engine RPMs) when plugging any MP3 or other sound device (GPS) into the AUX port and charging the device at the same time. Based on another review I was hoping this high quality and high priced cable would fix the issue, I am sad to say it did not."
1,Meh,"I have gone through 3 sets of these now.... They serve their purpose until they rip apart at the silver metal section/from the black cord section. I have taken great care of them, but eventually, they always separate. I will not be purchasing another set, and suggest you look elsewhere."
4,"Good Quality, slightly shorter / thinner jack","Use it with my 2.1 Harman Kardon, good quality, seems to have good shielding, jack a bit thin and can be loose in an old iphone, perfect otherwise."
3,Basic Aux cable,"The cable is a couple of feet too long to be used in a car comfortably, though it is high quality. The other negative is the 1/8"" mini is just a hair short if you cover your iPhone/iPod with a case. If it's a soft case, the plug can be pushed in but hard cases need to be removed."
1,Did not work for me,I bought this years ago and used it once or maybe twice. I had to keep twisting the jack so the sound would come in clearly. I don't know if it didn't fit into my radio or they gave me faulty one. Then I bought a $2 cable from a local radio store and that worked perfectly. My suggestion is save your money and get the cheaper one. It does the same thing!
5,Top Quality,It is an outstanding cable. is thick and flexible at the same time. The heads are rough and durable. The quality of sound is impecable with it
3,Fine players but.........,"While you might lick your chops at the line up of Clifford Jordan,Cedar Walton,Sam Jones,and Billy Higgins the problem is this and two more volumes were culled from a live tour and the results are bit loose and a mixed.To hear that rhythm section in all it's glory get ""Eastern Rebellion"" with George Coleman.I hold both Jordan and Coleman as among the best post Coltrane players so I wish these three LP's had been done in a studio.Check out Jordan's ""Two Tenor Winner"",""Royal Ballads"",""Live At Ethel's""""Four Play"" his two Strata East LP's etc and get these at the completist stage of your love affair with Clifford Jordan.CheersChazzboChazz"
3,Ok game,"To me Stronghold Legends is not as fun as stronghold crusader. I preferred the dessert look over this forest green. Plus I didn't really like the 3D effects when someone would get catapulted, they used to just splat now they get scattered and get right back up. I have to say that the first stronghold game was the best."
2,Dissappointing,"Its really bad. First off its super buggy - I have yet to have a game last longer then 30 minutes without a crash, had to reinstall it like 5 times and best of all it doesnt have LAN multiplayer (in this day and age which is a crime).Second, it adds new units but takes old ones away, they havent improved the graphics at all - so the ones that looked bad in Stronghold 2 now look really bad, the economic side of its been killed off, its all about combat now but they havent fixed the combat system up.So its become a bland generic RTS with bad graphic rather then a quicky, fun, differnt castle sim with bad graphics."
4,Pioneer west coast rap album,"This album is one of the first west coast rap albums to appeal nationwide, and give the country it's first taste of ""pimp"" style rap. When this album was released back in 1989, it was THE RAP album to have! Rappin 4-tay makes his now famous debut on ""don't fight the feeling"" which became his first album title 7 years later."
5,Life Is Too $hort,"This Is A GREAT Album. It Is A CLASSIC, AND Has Some Of Too $hort's Best Songs Of All Time. The Beats are perfect, so are the lyrics. GREAT ALBUM."
1,i lauphed...took a breath...then i lauphed some more,this CD has to be THEE funniest piece of garbage that i have ever listened to...this isnt rap...this is Bob Saggat gone musicGARBAGE!
2,Only the second track makes me want to dance,"Dance DJs and serious collectors should be advised that this ""orchestra"" sounds very much like it is synthesized. Percussion is supplied but what appears to be a reasonably good drum machine, and this gets rather monotonous. The non-piano keyboards sound cheesy.Tracks 1-6 and 11-15 are quickstep tempos. Tracks 8-10 are a bit slower, and so bronze or beginning foxtrot might be appropriate. I would dance samba to track 7. Tracks 4, 8 and 10 are more than four minutes long, and this gets tiresome in a quickstep or faster foxtrot. The only track that makes me want to dance is ""Nah neh nah."""
4,Cute film,"The animation is nice and the storyline is pretty amusing and fairly well-written. It's not the greatest, but this movie makes an overall good effort to entertain, with some genuinely funny lines and good scenes, and teaches a few lessons along the way."
3,Not so much for small kids...,"I suppose this was my fault for ignoring the PG rating. While this is a good movie...entertaining and all that...it's not so much for children. There are several ""Let's get the Hell back to Spain"" but what bothered me was the more sexual aspect regarding the girl.There's much sexual innuendo, if you ask me. I've let my little ones watch PG animated movies before, and while most of the time it's rated PG for fantasy action and mile peril or something, this one was rated PG for a different reason. Just wanted parents of little ones to be aware that there's more going on in El Dorado than hunting for gold.And believe me, if I was NOT a mother watching this with her children, it would have been 5 stars."
4,On The Road with the Children,"My kids love this movie, when we are in the car traveling all I have to do is pull out this DVD and there is instance silence."
3,"Good, but disappointing","This movie has great music and excellent animation. It has a lot of humor. However, I was shocked at the nudity and sex, which I have never seen in a cartoon before, and I hope never to see again in a cartoon. Without those scenes, it would have been much, much better. I think it should be rated PG-13, and done in live-action rather than animation so it doesn't appeal so much to children. This is by no means a children's movie.Especially after Dreamworks' exceptional treatment of the Moses story in ""The Prince of Egypt"", ""The Road to El Dorado"" was a big letdown."
3,Prince of Egypt was better,"Overall, it was ok. But my two main problems were: 1.) On a personal standpoint, I love Kevin Kline and especially Jeff Goldblum...I can't stand Rosie Perez. Errg. She annoys me to no end. It just ruined it for me, whenever she was in any scene. 2.) Katzenburg try to say he believed this was Tim Rice's and Elton John's best yet, music wise...I didn't find the music appealing at all. It sounded like ripped off Lion King. Lion King and Aida were so much better music wise. El Dorado's music just wasn't as entertaining or memorable. I will always remember Written In the Stars, Hakuna Matata, Can You Feel the Love Tonight?...But this movie's songs, no. That song the two sing when they are trying to get away from the guards, at the beginning of the movie, reminded me of Aladdin's One Jump Ahead. I just thought they could have done better. Animation, story, humor, and voice actors (besides Rosie), were all good. But those two facts just ruined the movie for me."
1,REGIONAL ERROR REGIONAL ERROR REGIONAL ERROR,"No where one the add did I have the option to select the REGION, Nor was I made aware the item I was about to purchase was out of region."
1,wrong region code,"I bought this movie and was excited to receive it and watch it, but when it finally arrived, it was from a whole different region code! AKA it was made in china or something and no American DVD player or Laptop will read it! I have no use for it now, seeing as its content is un-accessible. a total waste of money..."
3,Hope & Crosby meet Connery and Caine on the Road,"It is nice to see that Disney has some competition. This is a solid 3 star movie of average entertainment value. The strength of the movie is repartee between the two main characters. The script design reminded me a little of a combination of the Sean Conneryand Michael Caine movie THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING and the Road movies done by Hope and Crosby only here they are Spanish warriors, not british warriors or american dandys.This is a movie that had enough action for my little kids and enough comedy for the older ones, like me. If you are looking for non-disney family fun also check out SWAN PRINCESS, BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER and the LAND BEFORE TIME."
3,A Visual Delight...,"Dreamworks is known for beautifully animated films and this one is no exception. The colors are glorious and the animation is incredibly breathtaking. It is truly a visual feast for the eyes.I found the script to be less than satisfying, but nevertheless quite enjoyable. This is not a bad movie, it just is not a very strong one. There are a few clever interactions between the main characters, and more than a sprinkling of good laughs.All the blockbuster elements are in place, but they just don't come together as well as they do in more popular films such as Prince of Egypt or the Disney Classics.Overall I would recommend this film. Enjoy it for the visual masterpiece that it is and don't examine it critically.Cris"
5,The road to el dorado,I was very happy with my purchase. It arrived when I was told to expect it.It came in perfect condition.My son just loves the movie.I have been unable to find it anywhere.I was so glad the I could purchase these movie for my son and it be in perfect condition.Thank you so very much for making my 9 year old happy!!
4,Out of the Blue...,"I beg to differ but The song ""Out of the Blue"" is one of my favorite songs from an animated movie ever...and animated movies have produced some of the most meaningful songs in the last 20 years. That song at least deserves some kudos. As for Kline/Branagh - comedy at its best for kids and adults and i agree - the horse steals the show."
4,Road to Eldorado,This is an incredibly fun movie and has been a family favorite since its release. We were replacing our original copy.Like many good animated films - the humor is at many levels so that all ages can enjoy it.
3,"Entertaining?, yes. Great? No Way!","Dreamworks is trying again to compete with Disney on the animation department. This is not correct, they should do things different than Disney. This movie is funny, has great visuals and even has nice, but forgettable, songs. Elton John and Tim Rice did not reprissed their Lion King Success. Hans Zimmer didn't do it either. The story is not as good as The Liong King or Beauty and the Beast. I have to accept that the movie is better than Prince of Egypt but that doesn't make it a great movie. I hope Dreamworks makes better things from now on..."
4,El Dorado,The movie would only play on the computer. It did not work in several DVD players but the price was good.
5,Awesome,"I was expecting to get a crappy quality case because it's such an old movie, but nope! Good quality all around.Plus the movie is awesome. Keep in mind this is a DVD, not a BluRay disc. I personally can't tell much difference with movies like these, but just sayin'."
4,Extremely entertaining animated movie--and great DVD!,"This film was unjustly ignored in its theatrical run, but is worth owning on DVD for anyone who loves great animation. Dreamworks pulled out the stops for this one. It's a spectacular and fun-filled film that works not just for the kids (I have a 4 year old, and he loves it), but also for the adults. The banter between Miguel and Tulio, excellently voiced by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branaugh, is always fun, and the side characters are also a hoot. In particular the bad guy is a twisted and amusingly sick character. Also, the music by Hans Zimmer is great, and Elton John's songs grow on you (many consider it one of his best albums of recent years).As a DVD it's also a first class production. The picture and sound quality are outstanding, and it's packed with extras. There's a directors' commentary, a good making-of film, an Elton John music video, etc. If you like great animation, buy this one--you won't regret it."
4,"Possibly the road to El Disaster, but I thought it was OK","This movie was pretty good. The plot was okay, but it wasn't as funny as, say, Toy Story. It is basically the story of two men (Miguel and Tulio) who set off to find El Dorado, the city of gold. When they finally find El Dorado (through a series of amusing events) the people think they are gods. Tulio is wooed by the gold and the attractive Chel, and he wants to return to Spain. Miguel falls in love with the city and its people and wants to stay. How they resolve it has a nice ending. What I thought was nice was that the movie can totally have a sequel, according to the way it ended. I especially liked the scene where they play ball with a rolled-up armadillo. It's a cute movie, but not that funny, so don't expect a big laugh, although people have differing opinions. All in all it deserves the 4 stars I gave it."
1,This movie was awful,"I am not a professional movie critic by trade but I feel prompted to write a review on this movie after watching it.First, there were too many adult related things in this movie to make it a good movie for kids. The movie included some poor language, sexual references, cartoon nudity, criminals and violence.Second, the show was flat out boring. That was my biggest gripe, I just could hardly sit through it.Look for something better if you are going to buy a DVD for the kids. Disney lost it on this one."
3,D-Fuzzing,"It works well on pants and sturdy tops. I wouldn't use it on finer things for fear of snagging, but to pop it in my suitcase for travel, it's perfect. I'm giving one to a friend for the same purpose."
3,"Not perfect, but it works","Works better on sweaters with more ""texture."" Smoother sweaters leave slight snags. Overall, a good option. Not sure how it compares to a sweater stone, though."
3,ok,"Bracket works,but doesn't hold camera very well. Feels like it might strip the threads if I try to tighten it more."
1,Very Disappointed,!!!!!!!!!! The worst mount i have ever used !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!the mount will not stay in placespend the money for a good mount
1,"NONE of this rocks, roll the disc far away. . .","Many of the Ray Hamilton""Orchestra"" discs sound to me like a couple of guys with a keyboard trying to make a buck by passing themselves off as an ""orchestra."" Sadly, this disc is no exception. ""Orchestra"" is too bold a title for such a thin and poor sound. Hmmm.I would not want to hear a single track again. It does not make me want to dance."
2,Marc Anthony does not cut it,"Hector Lavoe is was a great star. His music is amazing and still lives today. The movie and the soundtrack does not do it justice. If you really want to hear the flavor, soul and emotion of Hector Lavoe, please buy Hector Lavoe's CD's. This movie and soundtrack is a terrible imitation. Unfortunately the movie portrays only the bad side and does not get the flavor of a great singer."
5,Excellent!,"In an environment of free speech it is expected that someone would say something negative about this album. I must disagree strongly, Marc Anthony shows and shares the wonderful gift that has been given to him.As they say ""imitaion is the sincerest form of flattery"". Somone else said it best when they said that Hector lavoe would be proud of Marc Athony.This album sounds great, and if you like Lavoe, you will not be let down if you get this cd."
4,A fantastic rehash of a Salsa Legend.,It goes without question that Marc's musical gifts do great justice to Hector Lavoe's songs. While it may be argued that one might as well buy the originals one cannot overlook the fact the both the movie and this CD will introduce many to the works and life of Hector Lavoe who would have otherwise not even know of his existence. Get this CD and the originals both on sale on Amazon!
2,"Music sound is great, but Marc, you are not Lavoe","I read the reviews and find myself asking, what did viewers really focus on when they saw El Cantante? I can tell you that Marc did nothing good to the image of Lavoe. Now, the non spanish viewers were presented with ""another spanish junkie"". Thanks, Marc. Hector was a human being with his demons and weaknesses. Thank you, Marc.I will say that the sound of the soundtrack is superb! The music itself deserves 5 stars. It does sound good and is refined per today's standards. But that is where it all ends. You want to experience Lavoe, then buy Hector's CD's and enjoy the legend.You liked the movie, then go ahead and buy this CD. But if you want to know who Hector ""Lavoe"" Perez really was all about, then look away from this page and type ""Hector Lavoe"" in your next search."
2,Agree with first review,"I was expecting a great re-make of LAVOE's songs, although been a fan of Marc, I believe he did a good effort as a actor to imitate one of the greatest Salsa singer in history.I don't recommend Salsaholics to buy this Cd, this production is just for Marc Antony fans to keep it in your a case as a part of your collection."
5,I Love It,I just saw the movie a few nights ago and I had not heard much of Hector's music before this. I love the CD! The production and playing is incredible. I think Marc does a great job and I am looking forward to exploring more of his stuff too.DJ-RJMusic4Life
1,Fake.,"I just don't see why people think this is such a great album. Marc Anthony doesn't sing as well as Hector Lavoe and it sounds like he is imitating him and at least I can tell, he just is not believable and if Marc Anthony is going to sing Hectors songs he should just interpret the music it in his own way. No one sings like Hector so if you like his music buy his albums you can't go wrong!"
5,great Cd,I love this Cd..The music is great!...I could do with out the last song on the cd but other then that Its great!..Hector Lavore Music makes me want to dance the beats the words make you want to get up and dance...
5,More Beautiful Bows,"I ordered 2 bows, because there was a deal offered. I'm glad I did, they are beautiful and fit perfectly. The shipping was fast and I would highly recommend this seller."
4,For Mature Audiences Only,"I usually don't read this genre of books; i mostly read love stories and action mangas but the the descripition of this book was very interesting to say the least. I am glad I bought this. This story line is great, the drawing is very nice and characters are very loveable. This book is very much for mature audiences and that was one of the things that made me get this. I was looking for something with a more grown up attitude and this book has it. I will be getting vol. 2."
2,"Great idea, just not suited for my set-up","I thought this would be the perfect product for protecting the wooden hoop on my bass drum. However, once you put the Hoop Guard on the bass drum hoop it becomes too thick to attach your bass drum pedal. I have a Tama Starclassic Maple drum kit (about 10 years old), and an older DW 5000 bass drum pedal (about 15 years old). I might be able to get a newer pedal that would fit my drum hoop with this guard attached, but that's not worth it unless I absolutely need a new pedal. Just a heads up if you're looking at this product."
1,Wouldn't stick to the hoop,"The hoop guards I received had virtually no adhesive on them, or else the adhesive had dried up in storage/transit. I'm returning them to get aPearl HPP2 Metal Hoop Protector for Wood BD Hoops."
5,One of the most talented artist of all time!!!!!!!,"I've been a fan of Glenn Jones for years, faithfully and he will always be the best in my opinion. His songs have such heart and you can actually feel as if you are a playing a part in the songs that he presents. This album is truly a hit.Buy it!!!!"
3,Decent,"I read through this book and found the explanations to be geared more to the theory of an artist who wants to create an object, render a scene, or animate an object. If you're looking for actual program code, this is not the book you want. If you're an artist looking for explanations of lathe, splines, bending object, and quality differences between flat rendering, Phong rendering etc., take a look into this. There's also a listing of businesses in the back with a brief description about their products and how to contact them. I couldn't get the demo version of Caligari's Truespace 2 to work -- one of the files (or was it a directory?) was burnt incorrectly onto the CD and the installer could not find what it needed."
4,colorful photos of all New England seasons,"Some beautiful photos of all New England seasons in beautiful colors, especially of beautiful gardens, romantic villages and landscapes. But not all photos show romantic views; photos like that of lobster traps are not quite up to the rest"
4,Mr. Midshipman Hornblower,"This is the first in the Hornblower series I have read. It is fun reading, but not as good as some of the more recent series on the English navy in the days of wooden ships. The Bolitho and Alan Lewrie series are probably better, but the Hornblwer series is entertaining if you like these kinds of books."
4,"For Midshipman, the editing and proofing is not bad","I almost was put off by some of the negative reviews, but I'm glad I bought the book. For this specific book (Mr. Midshipman Hornblower). the editing was fine, and better than some cases of ebooks for which I've paid more. There were perhaps a dozen typos. Although I remember the day when typos were more rare, this is not so unusual for any book I read in any format today. They did a good job on this one."
5,Lively adventure and pure fun,After seeing the A&E dipiction of this novel I had to give it a read. And much to my delight the excellent television miniseries was true to the book in the best sense. The books are easy to read and completely entertaining. If you enjoyed A&E's version you will love the books as well.
3,Fun but choppy,"This book introduces Horatio Hornblower to life at sea, where he must face down his own seasickness and the oppressions of an angrily underperforming senior midshipman. That accomplished, he embarks on a series of adventures and generally comes out on top. Each of the episodes is entertaining and well-written, but the book has a choppy feel and is easy to put down from time to time.If you are interested in reading the Hornblower series, I would recommend starting with Beat to Quarters, which Forester wrote first but is located in the middle of the series, and then reading Midshipman Hornblower."
5,YOU CAN FEEL THE SPRAY OF THE SEA ON YOUR FACE,"C.S.Forester has such an uncanny way of letting the reader get the true feel of the sea. One can hear the creaking and moaning of the rigging. I was truly transported. The character of Horatio Hornblower enters the heart easily and Forester makes it impossible to guess what situation our hero will be involved in next. Everything is here: history, adventure and a good rollicking tale."
4,great story,Enjoyed the book and just got the next one in the series. The story is entertaining and the historical content accurate.
3,Fine for what it is,"I instantly fell in love with the Hornblower saga through the wonderful series of A&E movies (available on DVD). I thought I'd give the first Hornblower book a try but was rather disappointed. You won't find the nuanced, charismatic versions of Hornblower, Pellew, Matthews, Stiles, and other characters in this book; it turns out that much of what makes the films great is actually the work of the screenwriters and actors, not Forester.Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is simply a well-paced but psychologically shallow series of adventure yarns best geared towards young-adult readers. Don't expect serious, insightful nautical literature a la Conrad or Melville (and perhaps O'Brian) nor the rich characters of the Hornblower films. The book is fun for a breezy read, but you'll likely enjoy the movies much more."
3,Not as good as I expected,"This book is a collection of stories about the first three years of Horatio Hornblower's career in the British Navy. Over the coarse of the book, we get to see him become involved in a number of adventures during the early 1800's. He takes over a captured ship and helps with fights on other ships and forts among other adventures.Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this book. I really didn't like Hornblower's actions in the first story, and it took most of the book for me to get over that. The sailing terms could have used better explanations as well.Still, there were some entertaining moments in the book. I especially enjoyed the story where he went for his first test for the rank of lieutenant.I've heard enough positive things about the series that I will probably read the next one. But this book wasn't the engaging start to the series I expected."
2,Poor proofreading,"I LOVE Forester's Hornblower novels, and have worn out a couple of paperback sets. It's great to have these stories in ebook form, but whoever transcribed them did a terrible job. There are incorrect words used in many places, and in some places find-and-replace has created errors. For example in Hornblower and the Atropos, the word ""triumph"" always appears as ""Triumph"", capitalized and in italics, because at one place in the book there is a ship named the Triumph.Such sloppy work would be acceptable in a $.99 edition, but not in a $6.00 one.This comment applies to ALL the Hornblower ebooks."
3,Midshipman Hornblower needs proofreading,"C.S. Forester's Hornblower series is unequalled, however, this eBook edition needs proofreading. For example, at one point ""jolly boat"" is mistyped as ""oily boat"". Surely for $6.00 readers should expect basic proofreading to be performed."
4,I agree... the whole series is a must-read!,"Others have written thorough reviews of this book, so I will only agree that it is an exciting, excellent series. I started reading them to check (as I often do) to see how well the (A&E) made-for-TV series and the old movie (starring Gregory Peck) held up against the books. I found myself pulled through the entire series by the personal struggles and strengths of Hornblower and others (does a man really think like that?), the thrilling descriptions of the handling of ships under sail (I needed a nautical glossary!), and the detailed historical settings (how much was non-fiction?). Four stars because parts could have been handled better, but on the whole it was a great reading experience."
3,Charming in its own right,"It's difficult not to compare this to Patrick O'Brian's stellar Aubrey/Maturin series (which certainly was influenced by this one), and it suffers in comparison. It lacks a strong linear plot, much less interesting subplots or meaningful character interaction. But for what it is, it's also charming in its own right. The historical tidbits and the marvelous Hornblower character are worth the read alone."
5,Stand lively there.,"Mr. Midshipman chronicles Hornblower's first years in the navy. The life of a Midshipman was hard indeed, although arguably better than an ordinary seaman. From his first use of ""for'rard"" to his first terrifying climb up the mast we begin to learn ""the ropes"" along with our hero. As time passes and he has various trials and adventures he begins to become the leader and expert sailor of later tales. One of the best part of the whole Hornblower series is the accuracy and detail with which the life aboard vessels is depicted. You can almost feel the deck pitch. Great beginning to a great adventure series."
5,Wonderful collection of short stories!,"This is a wonderful collection of short stories, as told by the moon to the author. You can read this one in a few hours, it is a pretty short read. Stories are heartwarming. :)"
1,Hallmark Channel Reject,"I disliked this book so much after reading the first two of the stories that the moon tells that I won't read the rest. The stories were no more touching than a bad made for televison movie. I found myself thinking, ""Where's the meat?"" and it wasn't that I was particularly invested in reading an intellectual or heavy piece. This book cannot be the same one that other readers/reviewers found touching and poignant... or compared to The Little Prince. Conversations With The Moon is a definite dust collector on my shelf."
5,Sub-Humans,"This is a great CD. The Subhumans are an extremely talented punk band. Their view-points are well expressed and they speak of real problems in the world. Their music isn't just about the problems with the system, but also how people are ignorant towards one another and to everything else. These guys are definetely worth listening to."
5,I want these guys to play at my birthday party,"This album is political like the rest of them, this one describes the kind of people working for state and not us."
2,Needs a major edit,"Words and the definitions run together. No separate listing for the different letters, the run together too. Different type settings as the pages go along. . .GO with the American Guide to Auld Scots Tongue, it is more expensive, but far better put together and no where near as confusing"
5,Fantastic writing! What a treat.,"I had been pining for a new book. What a great read. Obviously written by a fine writer, (as opposed to someone with a story first, writing second). Fun, great writing, vocabulary, use of metaphor, twisting timeline, historical references, interesting, varied settings, snappy dialogue, internal conflict, a-typical characters but a univeral theme, must have really kicked ass in Italian. I really enjoyed it. The part about the younger brother was a bit rough, and I could see it coming based on the Greek Mythology reference. Stretched out the pain that you knew was just around the corner."
2,not true to size,"I bought this last Christmas for my girlfriend and she always wears a2xl but the leeves were huge and long compared to the rest of the shirt. She doesn't wear itat all. I should have sent it back, but she insisted on keeping it probably to not hurt my feelings.Materials and zipper were fine..just poor precision on the sizing part."
4,Great Corn Bread,"My wife and I are Southerners and love cornbread. We have had lots of bad luck trying to find a mix that matches ""made from scratch."" This cornbread mix, a bit pricey, is superb. If you like ""real"" cornbread, you will love this. (Try it with a small can of diced peppers.)"
5,Good Searle reading,"If you've followed Searle to date you'll appreciate this new book of his. As you might be able to tell from the lengthier review above, it is not an introductory text of philosophy and is certainly not a pop self-help book for guiding lost souls through the ""painful reality of our world."""
4,Dualism deep-sixed,"I found the ""mind"" section of this book more interesting than the ""language"" or ""society"" parts, for the reason that it provides a compelling alternative to dualism - that the mind and body are separate. Searle's approach is that of course the mind is biological, but it's qualitatively different than any other biological system. Consious activity in the brain cannot be reduced to components as can digestion in the stomach. A delightful read."
4,"Direction of ""intentionality"" right on the money","Overall, I think Searle is right on the mark with his view on consciousness as a biological function and language/institutions as an artifact of consciousnesses interacting. The clarity and insight is excellent - and he's right: once someone says it (i.e., him), it all sound so simple and obvious.The only complaint that I have are the frequent use of the philosopher's ""It seems to me"" style of argument, which ""seems to me"" to leave him an easy ""out"" if counter arguments arise. I also disagree with some of his conclusions, such as the notion of ""status function"".But none of that stopped me from enjoying the book!"
4,Hangin' with Billy,The book is kind of like going to Billy's house and him showing you around... lots of fun! Smoke a doobie and hang out for a while... Great pics!
5,Rock & Roll Gearhead,"WOW. Awesome pictures and great stories. My husband is a ZZ Top enthusiast and I am so glad I bought this book for him. It also has some great pictures of cars Billy collected and since my family is a ""racing family"" this book was perfect! Well worth the money!"
5,GRAB THAT SLAB AND GRIND ME A POUND!,"DAt's what BFG say. The man is a GENIUS. This book is a fascinating read, and shines a whole new light on that little old band from Texas. I've always loved ZZ Top, but now I have a whole new respect for Billy Gibbons- the guy just oozes soul, is so understated yet so creative. This book shows how detail oriented, how creative, and how cool the man is. A great artist, a gearhead, and most importantly a genius on the gee-tar. Gotta love his life story. Buy it!"
2,a little disappointed,i'm a little disappointed from the book. i'm a ZZ fan but the biography part of the book is short and not so interesting. most of the book is photos and explanations about cars and guitars which i didn't find interesting. i'm looking for a book with more biographic information about the texas trio.
4,The Rev. Explains,"My man BFG. Nice tunes , nice beard, real nice cars, but MAN: those guitars are incredible!! Sharp dressed indeed...!"
2,a lightweight,pretty light on as far as bio goes. i suppose he wrote about what he wanted to but it doesnt reveal anthing about the rev you wouldnt already know. im a big fan but this memoir is not much.
4,"Holy Mud On A Stick, Batman!!","so cool! got it in less than a week, and in excellent condition! thanx amazon!!"
5,"1,2,3, The Crew is Called BDP.....","""My Philosophy"". ""I'm Still #1"". ""Jimmy"". ""Stop the Violence"". ""Ya Slippin'"". Five of the greatest rap songs ever made. Five of the most diverse styles ever represented on one album. KRS-One=One of the Top 3 rappers ever. Chuck D and Rakim round that out for me."
4,Great... yet also uneven,Not every song is a classic on this album... but My Philosophy is enough to make this album great.
5,GET THIS ALBUM! BY ALL MEANS NECESSARY!!!!!!!!,"FRESH! FOR 1988, you SUCKERS!!!How many people can forget that line? If you don't know it, you don't have the album! So what are you waiting for? Buy it!Best Tracks: ""My Philosophy"", ""I'm Still #1"", ""Illegal Business""; and the most HARD ROCKING track is:""YA SLIPPIN"", which hijacks Deep Purple's ""Smoke on the Water"" guitar riff and turns it into a hardcore hip-hop battle rampage.Krs does a nod to spoken word poetry at the end, a first for rap albums...""See how it sounds, a little un-rational, a lot of MC's like to use the word 'dramatical'"". CLASSIC MATERIAL, AN YA KNOW IT!!!!!!!!"
1,Fooled Again,"I purchased this book based on the editorial reviews.Well, I've been fooled again and again by glowing MOVIE reviews, but this is a first for me in literature. This is a badly written book. My one star recommendation is for you to purchase the book (it is inexpensive) to make your own judgment."
5,Works great!,My mother has really bad eczema and nothing has worked. I gave her this and she was shocked it stopped the itching right away.
5,the best for me,"Last winter I tried a sample of this cream. They were giving it away at my local health food store. I few pouches saved me from itching the whole season. Now, even though it is just October, I decided to get ready and buy it in advance because every other cream I tried failed. I did not try anything that is chemically based though so, I would not speak of those creams. But as far as all natural ingredients - this cream worked the best."
2,nice cream but no relief,"This cream did not provide relief for my excema, which is centered around my neck area. I have had excema (dermatitis) off and on for years, but it has become chronic since a particularly bad period for my hay fever allergies last October. I have no medical insurance, so have been hunting for an over the counter remedy."
1,"Derma-E stuff works, just not this particular product","I really like Derma-E products and have had great experiences using the various creams and serums. I have tried the Psorzema creme a few times in the hopes that maybe it would help at some point but, unfortunately, it hasn't. On it's own, it barely moisturizes my skin, much less help my eczema. Maybe I have to use more but it's pretty expensive for the size. It works better in combination with another lotion/creme but doesn't work any better with the body wash of the same name. I wouldn't judge other Derma-E products based solely on this one though."
5,Derma E Psorzema Cream,"I purchased this face cream for my wife. She has rosacea and this is one of the least expensive creams she can purchase for her face. She was buying this from one of the local stores, but since I got her the Psorzema Creme', she's been getting it from Amazon. Thank you Amazon for making our lives a little easier and saving us a few pennies."
1,"""why waste that talent""","The Brits just can't cut it for Alex. He needs to come back to the US with Jam & Lewis where they originated ""original"" songs for him. It ""makes no sense"" in his remaining in the UK -- wasting his time and talent (and depriving his many fans). Come on back home Alex and record some real music."
2,This is not it,"I purchased this cd because I miss Alexander O'Neal, and I'm annoyed that I can no longer get the All True Man cd. (Mine was stolen during a move) Anyway, I purchased this one but it does not make the grade. Alex, Jam and Lewis need to make amends or do whatever is necessary to bring this talent back. He was to make a severe mark on the industry when the NY Times wrote an outstanding write for his work on the All True Man cd. Jam and Lewis was onto something but whatever the situation was, they let him go. Hey Amazon, why don't you try and get this cd for us?"
4,dway,"This cab is great for keeping the snow from blowing back on to you when using your snow thrower. It is involved putting together and you have to take your time. In addition, it does add size (width and height) to your snow thrower frame. I am glad to have it now."
1,Does not fit ALL,"This ""cab"" doesn't in any way fit ALL 2 stage snowthrowers as claimed.It could be better helped in the assembly by color coding the parts instead of UF or LF, etc. It is by no means able to be assembled in 30 min."
5,you owe this cab to yourself,"Everybody that owns a snowblower will tell you the first rule.... the wind is always blowing in your face! This cab fits and functions great. One of the best features that no one has mentioned yet, is that the whole cab comes right off by simply removing 2 pins! This allows me to continue storing the blower in my shed during the summer. I just pop off the cab and store both pieces under my loft!This is an outstanding price. I had to wait for weeks to get mine because I waited till it started snowing to order. I'm sure you can avoid that by ordering in the off season. Allow yourself an afternoon to assemble and install this. If you take your time, and remember you only have to do it once if you do it right the first time, you'll find it's well worth the effort when the snow is blowing around at 20 mph and you have to clear the driveway!!!!"
1,Piece of Junk,This is a piece of junk. I bought one and it came with mismatched hardware. I was mailed the new hardware and it fit together. The next problem was that the outside cab does not fit the hardware. I just gave up.
2,Cover doesn't fit well over the frame,"It took all afternoon to put the frame together then the cover didn't fit right over the frame. The 4 pieces at the top that all join together was very sloppy. The cover was too small for the frame and one side didn't attach at all. It says to adjust if needed, but doesn't offer any suggestions on how to adjust it. We are able to use it for this storm but for the price of it it should have fit better."
2,Snow Thrower Cab,This thing is HUGE !!! I could not get it through the side door in my garage. Buy the smaller one unless you have a very large snowblower. It was a pain to assemble. It is not one of those items that is assembeled in 15 minutes out of the box.The smaller cheaper one is better for the average homeowner. Bigger is NOT better in this case.
3,Snow cab,"Found product to be easy to assemble, actual time was about 2 hours. Unable to determine how well it works, due to the lack of snow."
4,Great Product,"Took a few hours to connect properly to my Husqvarna Snow Blower, but all necessary fittings were there. Actual assembly of cab was straight forward. Only problem I had was stretching the canvas around certain parts of the frame (especially the top), but it eventually worked. After several uses, I am very pleased with its' performance, keeps all the wind and blowing snow off both me and the blower controls. There is plenty of room for my 5' 7"" frame to move within confines of cab. Overall, great product!"
3,Legal Thriller,"Cunning Treatment is a legal thriller set in a richly detailed Southern backdrop, reminiscent of the early efforts of John Grisham. A rigged election and blackmail storyline weave through this story of corrupt, power-hungry movers-and-shakers. I thought there was too much changing of POV, and the reader is left with no real sense of justice or triumph."
2,Not for Canvas or Cordura,"I bought this to label the equipment bags for our local Little League. Being that it is a fabric paint I assumed it would apply a nice thick coat of paint. Instead, it had the consistency of milk and was mostly absorbed by the canvas material that the bags were made of. I sprayed three coats on the bag hoping I would get a nice thick visible bag number to appear. That never happened so I conclude that this product must be meant for some other type of fabric that won't absorb it."
2,Turtles didnt like it,Turtles didnt like it...they'd only eat it if I fed them only it and they got hungry enough after several days. Not much more to be said. Could have just been my weird turtles but they didnt have problems with ANY other foods
4,Good stuff!,"My turtle likes these, though the uneaten parts can make the tank pretty messy, so I use these when I'm a week or two from cleaning the tank!"
4,Slidetime proves that she's THE female slide guitar player.,"It was really hard for me to imagine a respectable and serious female slide guitar player. I then happened to see Joanna Connor on stage a couple of years ago, just out of curiosity. This was the day I changed my mind. She was intense, dynamic, and powerfull, just to mention a few attributes of her playing. I liked Big Girl Blues, but Slidetime is my favorite. Just listen to ""You don't love me"" and ""Slide on in"" and you will appreciate her talent as guitarist. I also like the lyrics of ""It's not the Rock"". I was even more impressed when I knew that Joanna Connor was pregnant when she did the studio work for this album."
3,A Little Bit Tired,"This book has been around for quite some time now, and it shows. The content is very good, the photographs are adequate (over 100 colour photographs), and for a collector of cacti books this should be an essential buy. The author founded the famous Holly Gate Nursery in Sussex, England and has been quite a prolific author on the subject. His books are much sought after, but there are many more recent books on the subject and these will probably be more pleasing to the buyers eye. New printing techniques and improvements in photography have made the book look somewhat dated. Having said that the book is well written and provides lots of useful information. I have it in my collection, but then I would like every book ever published on the subject."
5,He's a good man...and thorough,"I'm gonna make this short...If you heard one track on here and really dug it your gonna like the whole record. They use mostly live instrumentation on this record and it stands out on this record more than others, that and the excellent production. The only time I've ever gotten negativism from this record are from the didjereedoo tracks which can easily be passed over if your not diggin' em."
4,Mostly solid with a fair bit of variety,"It's been said before, but if what you're looking for is Virtual Insanity, buy the single. With the exception of, to an extend, Cosmic Girl and Alright, it's really the only track on the album that has that feel or sound.There's a lot of ground covered on the album, and some of it is more successful than others. Virtual Insanity and Cosmic Girl are instantly likable, cheery numbers. Use the Force is a bit on the silly side for me, but things pick up for the next few tracks. Drifting Along pretty much runs right off the rail for me, and Didjerama is just plain boring (though Digjital Vibrations is alright).Things start to pick up again after that. Travelling Without Moving and You Are My Love move back in to the up-beat territory.The final two tracks are much more chill, but are also possibly my two favorite on the album.I'd easily recommend this, but be warned that you'll probably find yourself hitting skip on a few of the tracks in the middle."
3,A so-so record with some hits and some misses,"Virtual Insanity, complete with stunning video, is a great opening, funky and classy. Cosmic Girl is possibly even better, although the lyircs border on 'wacky' (""It's a distant solar system, tried to phone but they don't list them""). The title track, Alright and Everyday are also up there. But when the pace lets up on the album's second side, things get too sluggish with the ballads and didgeridoo music. Jay Kay just can't write that sort of song as well as he can write a funk or disco style tune. It may be quite 'pop', but to me that makes it easily digestible and refreshing. But this is no classic."
3,"Talk About a ""Cut-out""...","When the video for ""Virtual Insanity"" burst out of my television with its unique special effects and Jay Kay's signature vocal ""sound,"" I knew that I had found a band deserving of financial investment.Sadly, I rarely am able to ""sit"" through the disc in its entirety. It seems to be a work that is three fourths complete with eight of the thirteen cuts exceptional and five being substandard. I will refrain from listing them in their respective categories, leaving that to the individual listener.A disappointment after such an auspicious debut single makes this one a logical purchase from the ""discount"" shelves."
5,BUY THIS C.D. NOW,"I bought this C.D. a long time ago and hadn't listened to it for a while, then one day I picked it up and was blown away. I love this album, it's so funky, groovy and generally great. My favourite song HAS to be ""Travelling Withuout Moving"" the bass line is so fast and amazing. The whole album is full of great songs and I would advise anyone who likes a good groove to buy it now."
5,Just bought my second copy of this...,"Lemme see, how can I describe this CD... It's just amazing. I wore out my first copy, so I just recently bought a 2nd one. It's a great CD to listen to on a rainy day..or while driving in the car... shoot, let's just say it's a great CD to listen to *anytime*. It's definitely a pick-me-up! You've got all different kinds of music on it. raggae, rock, pop, jazz... etc. Whatever kind of music floats your boat, you can probably find on this CD. My faves would probably be ""Virtual Insanity"" (of COURSE...) ""Alright"" (just makes you want to dance) and ""Cosmic Girl"". Oh! and ""Traveling Without Moving"" and ""Drifting Along""...actually, I should just say I love every song on it. So...what're you waiting for? Get it, Get it NOW! Word of warning though, don't loan your copy to any of your friends...you might not get it back."
4,Play that funky music England!!!!,"Take it from someone who's been groovin' to funk music since I could walk, Jamiroquai's album, ""Travelling Wihtout Moving is the bomb. Listening to songs like Virtual Insanity, and Cosmic Girl you won't be able to sit still. The groove and the beat will lift you off your seat and make you want to dance the night away. Play that funky music England and I'll continue buyin' your albums!!!!"
4,THIS GROWS ON YOU,"I bought this album without having heard any song except for ""Virtual Insanity"". This is still one of my 5 favorite songs ever, but there are some other good songs on here that I didn't like at first. ""Alright"" and ""Cosmic Girl"" (the two singles released after ""Virtual Insanity"") are two songs that sort of sound like disco, but they also have a nice funk/r&b vibe going. ""High Times"" doesn't have that great of lyrics, but it has a really good chorus. The title track and ""Use the Force"" are also very good. In conclusion, this is one of the must-have albums of the past 10 years. I would like to say though that as good as this album is, you should really check out Jamiroquai's newest release A Funk Odyssey. In my opinion, it is Jamiroquai's best overall album."
1,Shipped instantly,"Thank you, seller, for this product. I have loved this cd for so long and it is no longer in print and you cannot find it in stores. I was psyched when I found it on Amazon (they have everything by the way). I received the cd in excellent condition and also before I could even forget that I ordered it."
2,Average at best,Virtual Insanity was the jam here.cosmic girl was cool but this disc is downhill after that.Jamiroquai has moments here&there with the Stevie Wonder Influences but it doesn't hold up.
5,Works so well for so many different types of people,"This album flows so well, its sometime difficult to tell where one song ends and another begins. The work on the ""Digi"" in the middle of the album is a fantastic taste of the instrament's vast and variable sound. Overall the album rivals that of Pink Floyd's Dark Side, in its sense of moving... actually traveling from song to song. This is the sort of record for listening to loud, with the lights off... or if you have the lights on... use lots of multicolored ones!"
5,This CD rocks!!!,"If you haven't got it yet, you should go get it right now!!!!! After I got it I liked them so I went and got the other two and can't wait 'til the next one comes out!"
1,Great production values -- but no originality,"Listening to this CD, which was ultraclean and ultracrisp was like listening to a tribute band to 70s soul -- good chops, but absolutely nothing new. Everything is copped from somewhere else. It doesn't even have wit... and I thought that was a British forte. If you're hooked on the bubble-gum qualities of ""Virtual Insanity"" try and find a single... because this CD just isn't worth it."
3,The turning point,"For us Jamiroquai fans who love the instrumental and creative side to the band, Travelling Without Moving is the album that begins a total descent into 'jazz-pop', that Jamiroquai, by the two latest albums have turned into. The album does deserve 3 stars due to its' obvious merits in terms of accessability. Virtual Insanity is the best song on the album, and one expects the album to develop depth and innovation wise, but it simply never occurs. One of the main reasons seems to be in the bands increased use of strings and guitars, rather than a greater range of horns and synths, which makes Jamiroquai's music less challenging and gives it an easy cuddly feel.Overall the album is a collection of catchy songs, but with little experimentation, sadly unlike Space Cowboy and Emergency."
2,Skip it..,"After seeing a Jamiroquai performance on tv I was convinced I would love this cd. That didn't turn out to be the case...the vast majority of this disc is jumbled nonsense and the only two songs that are at all redeemable are ""Cosmic Girl"" and ""Alright"". Don't waste your money..."
1,Ummmm.... Okay.... What now?....,"""Virtual Insanity"" is the only song I really like on this CD. The rest of the songs sound a whole lot alike... Disco. I never lived disco (I'm only 12), but I hope it's not coming back. I don't know; maybe I just need to listen to the CD once more. I just hope ""Canned Heat"" is better. Sorry, Jamiroquai. Your music just isn't my type."
4,This book is very informative,I purchased this book for a psychology course. I rarely opened it but it did have several graphic illustrations of children victims of child abuse. However the content of the book is very informative and it does help understand and know what are the signs of child abuse
4,Lovely Mahamudra,"I found this book (in English) in a bookstore in Kathmandu, Nepal. Synchronistic. I believe it was the very first Mahamudra book I've read. It was a delightful, though short, introduction. I recommend it highly for those who wish to get their feet wet. In a way, the title says it all. Enjoy!"
3,Cowboy Cooking,The book buyer should understand that this book is written for children and not for adults. The content of the book is very limited if you are looking for references and useful material on the range of diet of the American Cowboy...
5,A very fun show to watch,"Didn't want to spend too much on it, and I don't see it available much...so I was very glad to find a new copy so affordable.A dvd would be great, but they seem to cost over $20."
3,Gimmicky writing style gets old,"This book is well worth reading if you're interested in space probes. (About half is Voyager related, for any Voyagerphiles out there.) Unfortunately the author deploys a gimmicky writing style that slowed my progress and kind of wore me down. Apparently he's some big-time Time magazine writer, so I suppose he's accustomed to writing for the masses. Definitely some interesting stuff that I hadn't read before though, and I would buy it again. Not sure how to describe the writing issue other than it being overdone. Maybe uses too many fake conversations that he reenacts with implausible detail."
3,NOT ENOUGH,"yeterli düzeyde bilgi birikimine sahip olmayp , konular üstün körü ilenmi. Konular gereksiz detaylarla boulmu gerekli detaylar göz ard edilmitir. Adamlar üenmemi 630 sayfa yazm ama bo ben netekim daha iyisini yazarm kanatindeyim."
4,jVery well made puzzle.,"We have a couple of these puzzles in this searies and although they are a little trickier to put together than a square puzzle, the finished product is very nice and the peices of the puzzle are very sturdy. I have had mine for several years and they are holding up well in a day-care setting."
5,Soothing and delightful,"Just what the Spa therapist ordered. Do it at home, don't keep paying others to touch you when you can enjoy this one yourself!"
3,Educational Video,a good video to backup you kids in numbers.if they know how to count 1 to 10 then this video can help improved their counting to a hundred with easy to understand words used. my kid like it very much. she watch it every day.
5,Catholic Beliefs,This is an excellent book on the Biblical basis for Catholic beliefs. It is an easy read and an excellent reference book for later.
1,Unconvincing,"I read both Patrick Madrid's Where is That in the Bible? and Why is that in Tradition? While I have respect for Catholics and believe that many of them have true faith in Jesus, I do not agree with many of the Catholic beliefs and doctrines. I am a Christian but I am interested in what Catholics believe because I have many friends who are Catholics. Before reading this book I had, in my lifetime, read the entire Bible, the Vatican II documents, and studied the Catholic canons. That was enough to convince me that many of the Catholic teachings are not in the Bible, and even go against the teachings of the Bible. This book failed to convince me otherwise."
1,Poor!!,"I purchased this fogger and it was DOA. Took it back and got another one, it lasted about 30 min and quit working. Will look elsewhere for better quality."
5,I love Bratz. No matter what you people say.,"I am a bratz fan. There is no stopping me. My Scene fans just come on the bratz side and waste their time bashing bratz. Bashing bratz is not only making my scene look bad, but it is also making YOU , Mattel, and all of the other my scene fans look bad. So it is your problem if you want to cause all of this. STOP THE RIDICULOUS DOLL WAR!!!!!"
5,Theres no GOD DAM WAY your an avril fan.......,"OH YEAH, NOTE: AVRIL LIKES BRATZ. if youd look on [...] (a while back) there was a pic of her with flash back jade so yes it would be GREAT if they made an avril bratz doll if they made a my scene avril doll id throw up PS avril HATES MY SCENE AND BARBIE SO....yeah..."
5,I think this doll is fab!,"I must say this Cloe doll is unlike the rest. The Cloe dolls normally remind me of the Barbie collection, but this Cloe doll just COMPLETLEY doesn't! It's a perfect example of how people used to dress in the 1980's, which does have it's educational values! I can't tell you much about the CD as I lost it, but the rest of the accessories that came with it are awesome! She has loads of cool earrings, a pair of black tear-drop ones, some white hoop ones, plus, little pink and silver ones. She also has a pair of star earrings which match her necklace and the chains on her skirt. She has three black bangles and triangular white, pink and black ones! Her hat and head band are gorgeous and match her ""flirt"" belt. I love this doll, and always pick her to take to the make-believe clubs! I would recommend this doll to any collectors or anyone new to the business. P.S. She look like a mini Madonna as she has brown highlights and white fishnets!"
5,What a treat for ears of all ages!,Music that will never go out of style and enjoyed by all! Must be part of your collection and a great gift for others. Great musicians on this cd...
5,still the best,"It was 25 years ago that I first heard Gove playing at the Exit Inn in Nashville with Doc Watson and I knew that I needed his album, Shady Gove. I was not disappointed. It is probably the finest bit of bluegrass that I've ever heard. Backed by Doc, John Hartford, and other incredible musicians, one can only wonder how anyone could move fingers that quickly across a set of strings and make it sound so superb.When I found recently that Shady Gove had been combined with Cocoanut Gove, a later album, I bought the CD. Totally fabulous. This combination of the 2 is a classic. Anyone enjoying bluegrass will see this cd as a favorite. SOLID GOVE is a must !!"
4,FURTHUR,I suppose the style of writing Tom Wolfe chose to adopt for this book was an attempt to try and capture the turned on and tuned in mind state of it's characters. Whether said style has aged well is besides the point. THE ELECTRIC KOOL-AID ACID TEST is still a fascinating glimpse into the lives of a group of cultural renegades known as The Merry Pranksters. Their lysregic-fueled adventures are chronicled here in all their joyous and unpleasant detail. This was the beginning of the 60's drug culture and the cast of characters aboard the bus are fascinating. An entertaining read.
2,"I tried, I really really tried.","I got this book at a garage sale and I was really looking forward to reading it. I heard so much about it and was surprised when I also found it in the library, multiple copies, under classics.I really like historical counts of the sixties counter culture but this never kept my interest to keep picking it up again. If you finally got interested in something, to follow along like a story or a sensible account, it just dropped it. I never found myself really caring about the people involved. Everything was just there, but the people were acting like everything they did had some great meaning, and it just seemed tired.I got thru 150 pages. I had to quit. I skimmed the rest of it really really quickly to get the jist of it. I looked up a summary of the book on the net, and I didn't miss anything in the plot. I wanted to like this book. But, no go.Maybe you just had to be there...or be ""zonked""...."
2,"Drugs, obviously.",The only possible explaination for this atrocious book is that Tom Wolfe himself was partaking of the mind altering chemicals.Tom Wolfe must have been under the influence when he wrote this atrocious book. It's just not enjoyable on ANY level. He rambles on for pages in what I assume is his attempt to convey the psychedelic experience to his readers and it just doesn't work. Perhaps if you have never taken these drugs you might find this kind of drivel persuasive but for me it was just silly.Tom Wolfe really comes of age in Bonfire and Simmons.
1,simply unreadable,"If you are looking at this because it's linked to Hunter S. Thompson, I would steer clear. The book was wholly unreadable. I left it on a Boeing 777 over the atlantic after about 50 pages. If you like Hunter, dont expect much from this."
3,A Trip Down Memory Lane,An interesting review of the era of drugs and rock and roll that characterized the 1960s. However Tom Wolfe's writing style is not for me. Run on sentences that go on for half a page and restate the same point more than once. Ken Kesey's life and the antics of his followers is interesting but could have been told with 50% of the words used by Wolfe.
4,Great Book in Okay condition,"Was an item i wanted for a long time. Great read and real insight into the realm of psychedelic drugs. A little upset on the like new condition of the book. I usually don't care, because come on, its just a book. But the cover was creased and it had some bugling to the the pages. but all in all it was a good price for a book."
4,Excellent ride!,"Tom Wolfe, although most definitely a square himself, does an excellent job of capturing Kesey and the Prankster's quest to find spirituality though drugs. The ride is entertaining, and the writing style is creating and interesting.I assume the material is somewhat polarizing, but if you're interested in learning more about Kesey, this has to be the best collection of information about his life.The question is, are you on or off the bus?"
5,The Encapsulate of the Trippy Culture,"If you've ever experienced the alternative lifestyle, you'll revel in Tom Wolfe's account of the Merry Pranksters. Every page will make you see sounds and taste colors!"
5,Your ticket to,"Tom Wolfe is one of the most engaging and genuinely original storytellers I've ever read. The story is a hoot but they way he tells it... is breathtaking.Tom Wolfe is the real deal - he was there. I know, because I was there. I experienced that drugged soaked summer of '67 and no one captures it better than Wolfe.Although some consider Wolfe a ""journalist"" he actually writes like a storyteller - a superb storyteller.Richard A McCullough[...]"
4,Kesey tribute,"If you are interested in the 60s culture on the extreme end, read this ook. It is a well written book about Kesey and his bunch of crazy hippies tripping there way through society.After reading this read 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest'"
4,good book,the book was well written and quite interesting. It gave me a taste of what life was in the 1960s. Good Book!!
3,Boring.,"Maybe I cannot appreciate the book at a young age, but it was quite boring. It did have some funny parts, and was interesting. But I had to put it down after a few chapters. Maybe I will pick this up again in a few years (I still have my place bookmarked). I am going to try a few other Wolfes soon though.END"
1,I smell a rat.,"You can be sure growing up whenever a group of kids was upto no good Tommy would report to the parents or teachers,and be rewarded.If ever a hatchet job needs doing against any challenger to mainstream thinkingTom will be there with a book with no bibliography,but many assertions."
2,Maybe if I was there...,"Wolfe, in his author note, states that he attempted to ""re-create the mental atmosphere or subjective reality [of the Pranksters]."" While I laud his attempt to let us know what hanging with the Merry Pranksters was really like, I really just didn't get it. There is some fine journalistic writing in the book, but it is buried under all the ""mental atmosphere"" writing, which probably only makes sense to those people who have taken acid (which does not include this reviewer) or who were part of the late-1960s counterculture in San Francisco (which again does not include this reviewer, who was born in the late 1960s).Anyone who is expecting a ""straight"" account of the Pranksters are advised to steer clear, but those with a taste for the surreal will probably find this book quite enjoyable."
3,not sure i passed the test,"Maybe I was born too late to really follow the works, maybe my distance from the Merry Prankster mentality prohibits my appreciation for what has been written. Sadly, this was one of the slowest reads I have ever had. I had a great deal of difficulty connecting with the Pranksters or what they were trying to accomplish. They seemed to go so far off the end of the spectrum that their message was lost on me. I suppose I'm not ready to drop out yet.That being said, the fact that anyone was there to document what happened is a saving grace. I was happy to read about a time in American History that I did not live through or really ever hear about. The information was interesting as was the actual activities and motivations.I just wasn't able to connect."
3,"Good trip, bad trip","I liked the first half, which focussed on Ken Kesey's history and the scene in Palo Alto and La Honda; also delved into the movitation of Kesey from a psycho-social angle. But once Kesey took off for Mexico the book becomes like an action comedy, following his flight almost exclusively."
4,History of LSD and it's introduction to the public,"Wow. What a book! This book took me back to my teenaged years.A lot of history about LSD, it's origins, it's production, and the intellectuals who believed it was ""the"" drug..a drug that all should experience to have mind-altering and mind-expanding experiences. Quite a book! I would recommend it. Wolfe is a genius documenting the events of the time. A lot of history and background on Ken Kesey (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest), Timothy Leary, and other involved in the ""new"" drug, LSD."
2,Frustration,"This toy was cute. My 3 year old begged me for weeks to but it for him. Once I did, he became quickly frustrated. The on and off swith moves so easy...I was going through batteries almost every day. Woody does not stay on the back of the car, I had to super glue him, and he still managed to pop off. The car moves very slow, and the wire lead is too short. I recommend buying a better toy instead of this one."
4,From someone who saw this without the rose colored lens of nostalgia,"Hasukawa Kazuya is a high school freshman with a broken heart. His first love just got married - to his brother. To flee this ridicules home situation, Kazuya moves into Greenwood, the school's dorm. There he hopes for peace and quiet... but thats not what he finds. Greenwood is home to the weirdest students on campus.Here is Greenwood is a 6 episode OVA based on a 11 volume manga, so much of the story is left out. The first four episodes are self contained, while the last two are a two part arc about Kazuya's new crush. The funniest episode has the residents of Greenwood making a fantasy movie with characters that have ridicules names like ""Lemon Herb"" and ""Cool Mint"". I laughed every time the evil demon king was called ""Cool"".This was my first time seeing this show, so I don't have the bias of nostalgia, but I thought it was pretty fun. Go ahead and give it a try!"
4,Here is Green Wood,"Here is one of the classics from that golden era of Japanese Anime of the 1990s. It is a well constructed combination of a humorous and very human view into the life of youth, which is not restricted by any nationality. I have lived in Green Wood and I love the way this takes me back. A pity there were only six of these."
2,Not Much On Character Animation,"This book is an OK beginners guide to setting up OpenGL and DirectX render wrappers, but there's very little information on character programming. The author looks into very basic skeletal key-frame animation, but doesn't cover any other techniques such as vertex animation or kinematics. I was very disappointed to find numerous typos and blatantly wrong statements. Programmers looking to create better animation code would be better off looking elsewhere."
2,Not all good things come in small packages,"This book is too sparsely written to recommend buying at its price. Less than 200 text pages of 6"" x 9"", the author describes in Ansi C how he has chosen to very basically accomplish what he has done on the CD. I've less than a few years of programming experience, but in my opinion, you are better served by buying a few back issues of a game programming magazine than take a chance on this deceptively packaged book. Nice cover though!"
3,ok,they are ok look a lot bigger in the pic but all in all good for the cash i put out for the earrings
2,Not As They Appear,"What a disappointment. The stones are really pink and the clasp often comes undone. Also, note the size...they are tiny."
4,Garnet Hoop Earrings,"Although very pretty, the garnet stones are more orange thanred. I am keeping them, but would have preferred a more redstone color. I would have rated these 5 stars but for thecolor."
1,Loose Stones,"As you can see by many reviewers, the stones tend to fall out of these. Very disappointing! Amazon should not allow these to be sold anymore. Do not be tempted to buy as they are crap."
5,garnet earrings,These are beautiful garnet earrings...birth stone for January. I love the way they fasten and don't pinch your ears or have to worry about losing them. Not real large but show up very well.
1,stone fell out,"These are pretty earrings but the first time I went to put them on, one of the stones fell out and I had to return them. They are cheaply made and I do not recommend them."
1,VERY small,"I suppose I didn't read the description correctly, but I did think these were bigger than they were. I bought them as a gift for my grown daughter since her birthday is in Jan. and they're a garnet stone, but they'd probably be better as a gift for a small child. After reading the other reviews I just hope the stones - infitisimal as they are, don't fall out."
5,GREAT VALUE & BEAUTIFUL,Very elegant! Great value and quality. The stones are a beautiful vibrant green color. Very pleased.
3,not what expected,"i got these earrings for myself after i gotSterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Hoop Earringsfor my sister. i should have taken a closer look at the picture (so it is my own fault i'm dissatisfied with the product), my sister's earrings were so pretty, but i do not like the way the stones are set on these ones. i kept them, but i don't wear them often as i do not think they're very pretty."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I bought these earrings, and the first time I took them off, a stone fell out. I glued it back in, the second time I wore them it fell out again. Lost it, so these go in the trash! Don't waste your money."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed... I bought these as a Christmas present for myself..haha I received these yesterday just in time to wear them to my office Christmas dinner/party. Got them out of the box, left one went on fine, but while putting in the right one, one of the stones fell out. Of course, as small as the stones are, took me forever to find it. Needless to say, I had to put my other earrings back on and put these back in the box :( As far as looks, I thought they were very beautiful, unfortunately I won't be able to wear them, first without fixing the one, and second without the fear that the other stones will ultimately fall out and be lost...oh well."
1,stone fell out,"These earrings were pretty, however, one of the stones fell out the first time I wore them. I sent them back two weeks ago and am still waiting for a confirmation that the shipment has been received and a refund."
1,Stones fall out,"I received these as a Christmas gift. One of the stones fell out. Don't waste your money on these, instead buy earrings of better quality."
1,Wife was upset,"I purchased these as a gift for my wife. She loved them, they are very pretty and dainty. However, after 3-4 uses, several of the stones popped out and we were unable to fix it. It was too late to return them, so we just threw them out. Due to the design, the earring bends a little each time you put them on or off. It's really a shame, because they are quite nice, but, it's only a matter of time before the stone(s) will pop out."
2,faulty clasp,"The earings were nice enough when they arrived, however upon wearing them a couple of times I noticed that the earing did not 'catch' well on one of them. It opened several times when I was out. I was always checking them to make sure they were there. Last week while out on an errand, I came home and noticed that one of them was gone. It had opened up and fallen off while i was out. They need to make sure the clasps work better."
3,Loose connections,"The earrings are beautiful, but the clasp does not stay closed very well on its own on one of the earrings. Took it to a store and they tightened it right up."
2,Deep Red Color???,"The earrings are pretty. However, as an owner of numerous garnets of varying shades, I cannot stress enough that these will not be able to be worn with ANYTHING red. They are a very pale orange color. Maybe I got duds, but the description is completely inaccurate. They're a clear orange color. No red undertones or anything. I'm keeping them because they were $20 and it's not worth the hassle of returning them. I'm doubting whether they're actually garnets, but at this point I guess I just don't care."
3,Nice -- but odd color,"These were pretty, sparkly and packaged nicely, but they were far from the color that is shown. They are more of a pale orangey color. They are still nice for the price, but not what is shown."
5,Nice for cheap earrings,"These were exactly what I expected for the $20 I paid. The garnets aren't the darkest I've ever seen, but they are pretty and the earrings sparkle."
1,Poor Quality,"I got these as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. I thought they'd make a good stocking stuffer since peridot is her birthstone. However, when I recieved the pair I ordered, I immediately opened them up to make sure they were what I had ordered. One of the earrings had a missing peridot stone. I returned them as per Amazon.com's return policy (which I must say, is extremely easy to use, painless, and hassle-free). I recieved a replacement pair within a short period of time (still before Christmas) and checked them to see if they had all of the stones intact. Unfortunatly, the replacement pair also had a earring that was missing a peridot stone (in a different position than the last pair). After I sent the second pair back, Amazon.com refunded my money and apologized for the problem. Good service from the company, too bad the product had flaws."
3,Pale - Pale - Pale!,"Emeralds are a deep luscious green! Gorgeous but expensive.Peridot is much, much paler, and much much more affordable.But these were SOOOO pale they were practically yellow - and a pale yellow to boot.And they are indeed smallish.I would not buy them again and I donated them to a thrift shop to sell so they could raise some money for a good cause.I think the photo is way too flattering. Kind of dishonest, really."
3,OK,The earrings aren't so charming because of very pale stones. In reality they are nice but no more than that.
1,Never mind the reviews that praise the album,"As a long-time fan of Daniel Ash and his varied side-projects, I feel it best to sever his past genius from this failure of an album when crafting this review. Yes, Daniel Ash has an excellent and expansive oeuvre, yet this disc is without-a-doubt his weakest effort to date. There are a few strong tracks such as 'Walkin' On the Moon' and 'Spooky', but do yourself a favor and skip this one. If you are still curious, seek out the American Psycho soundtrack for an excellent, atmospheric version of 'Trouble' that is much more powerful than the clunky album version. Also, to hear the best tracks off this album, you would do well to seek out the excellent Come Alive album - a much more wise investment than this unfortunate mess."
4,Dan being All Daniel,"Mr. Ashes latest release shows us everything he's made of.Here we get Tones on Tale to the Electronica of LnR LIFT.It's all about the hypnotist and Ash is a master. It's refreshing to hear an artist make an album for himself and not the fans who want the same songs written over and over.He's never been afraid to evolve as an artist and I've had to relearn at every release. Look at each departure the LnR releases took from their previous. Viva Le Daniel.If you don't like the latest, you clearly don't get it."
3,Not as inspired this time,"It looks like good old master Ash made this record in his room with a computer, which is not bad. Grooves are fantastic and it's great for playing at a trendy bar. But it does not resist for long the passage of time, and soon you'll get tired of it. It's very, very far from his Love and Rocket masterpieces such as Express or Seventh Dream, and even from his classic solos like Coming Down. I'd say Ash is not at its best. However, I would encourage you to buy it only for one mega-marvelous song: ""Burning Man"". It's worth the price of the whole album."
4,A great album,"This album is great and while it is a turn from his other works (Of course! Give him some credit, Mr. Fanbase) it can be compared a little to Love & Rockets' ""Lift"". My favorite songs are ""Walking on the Moon,"" ""Ghost Writer,"" and ""Come Alive."" His cover of Spooky is kind of stupid though."
5,enlightening,"i bought this for a friend that broke her dvd, she was so pleased to have it again. she watches it often and said it helps her realize that we are here for a higher purpose and mother teresa exemplified that purpose. it makes a wonderful gift for spiritually enlightened (or curious) people. thanks."
5,Thank you Mother Theresa,"Probably, with ""The Legacy"" this video is one of the best documents on Mother Theresa and the Missionaries of Charity.Ten years have ellapsed and the Mother Theresa, through the Missionaries of Charity and their work, keeps teaching us so many things.The video is a small but precious reminder of that great woman and her holyness."
1,DVD would not play on either of my players. Twice.,"The DVD would not play on either of my 2 DVD players, but gave a message to the effect that the disc may not have playback capacity. Amazon sent me a replacement, and the same thing happened. I returned both DVDs and my payment was promptly refunded. I was disappointed, though, because the DVD got such great reviews I really wanted to see it."
5,So soft!,"These stars reside in our son's crib in his ""Under the Sea"" themed nursery. He loves them! They are so soft...he likes to nuzzle against them and fall asleep. They seem to be well-made. We've had them for over 6 months now...he pulls on them, goobers on them...and they are in excellent condition. Really pleased with the product overall."
4,Fantastic album featuring GREAT guest artists,"This is a full album of music with warm, rich tones and countless layers of interesting sounds. Features great guitar work by Charlie Sexton, Jon Dee Graham, Kurt Neumann (The Bodeans). The production (by Austin's Michael Ramos)is fantastic. Overall, I would suggest this album to anybody. It's well worth your time and money. Although this band has broken up, some members play in Dallas' Deadman...who's music i would also recommend. Also, check out Nashville's Milton Mapes."
4,Toddlers love pull toys,"I recently bought a pully toy for my 2 year old who just loved pulling it everywhere we went. Who would have thought that my 4 year old would still want one at his age, so we purchased clifford. Both love pulling them through the grocery store, mall, and on a walk.As for the Clifford pull toy, it's very cute how he wags his tail as he walks, and everyone we pass is always complimenting my son on his adorable dog.On the other hand he is a little bit taller than the average pull toy, thus falls over easier. His pull string is also removable and hasn't been seen in some time.A great toy for a child who loves clifford or wants a pet dog, but be prepared to stop and fix him as he ends up on his side quite a bit."
1,Frustrating and breaks easily,"We bought this toy for our 3-year-old to pull around. We thought he would enjoy taking Clifford on walks. Well, it works nicely if you go very slowly, have a steady hand, and don't turn any corners--tell me what kid does that! It tipped over all the time and was very frustrating to use. It even tipped over when I tried it! The rubber rings on the wheels came off constantly and could be a choking hazard. The paint chipped all over the place and the screws came loose (also choking hazards). This toy spent more time on our 'repair bench' than on the floor. Overall, I couldn't believe this toy was so highly priced. Save your money and buy something else!"
4,Jonathan Bulter,More Than friends by Jonathan Butler is a great jazz/pop CD to to added to anyones' collection.
4,Great memories,"I was talking to a friend of mine reminiscing about the good old days and JBs Sekona came up in our conversation. I remembered I once owned a tape of this album (which was stolen) and then I decided to purchase the CD.....its one for collection.....More than friends, naughty...good CD"
5,Excellent!,"Although recorded in 1978, this one was Grammy nominated in 1980 (along with another Omartian production, One More Song For You by The Imperials)Seasons of the Soul is one of the best Christian/Inspirational recordings of All Time. Michael and Stormie kick it Big Time here. Their very best effort among their three duet recordings. Worth every dime."
5,Wisconsin!,"A very nice golf gift set. The towel is of great quality and has an easy latch on it to put on or take off the golf bag. The golf balls are Nike and the ball markers are magnetic. The tees are cool. The top isn't bowl shaped like typical tees, but rather has little wood stands (I guess) that hold the golf ball. Hey, it works for me. Also, even though the gift set says there is a ball mark repair tool, there isn't. I already have a Wisconsin divot repair tool, so no big deal for me. In all, I'm happy with it. All Team Effort golf gift sets should be just as good regardless of collegiate affiliation."
4,Scroll above for true packaging,This was a Christmas gift for my grandfather. The packaging wasn't true to Amazon. See above for true plastic packaging. Once you open the item that's it. It had to be put in a cheap Christmas gift bag as the plastic packaging couldn't be wrapped nicely. Wish it had come in the box as advertised. The plastic cheapened the presentation.
2,Not the Best Episode,"Part 1 of this review is that this is cruddy offering of a cruddy piece of creative.One episode on the DVD with the ""filler"" of the ""live audience"" appearance is not the most bang for your buck, to start with. And for all the hooplah surrounding the ""banned"" episode:Part 2 is that this is not a great FG episode. It's not the raunchiest, it's not the best written and by far, it's not the funniest.I will say, at least, that it is probably one of the more thought-provoking: SPOILER ALERT ** SPOILER ALERT ** SPOILER ALERT **** SPOILER ALERT **There is much to converse about after, as the question lingers: what would you do if you were carrying a baby as surrogate for another couple, who then die? Lois' uterus pretty much becomes host to a ""citizen without a country"" and it gives you reason to pause.But it doesn't give you much reason to applaud, and zero reason to laugh."
3,Banned?,"I'm not sure why this episode was ""banned from TV"" but not only is it unoffensive but it is pretty silly as well, more so than the usual FG ep. We get it Seth, you're an atheist and liberal, stop beating us over the head with it! It's eps like this one that proves Simpsons and South Park are far superior to Family Guy, because they take the middle ground in most cases instead of polarize their fans. This ep has a good message but not good enough to warrant an individual purchase. Save your money and form your own opinions."
3,Funny episode,"Hilarious Family Guy episode, but I was really disapointed that the ""almost live comedy show"" was still censored like it was when they aired it! If I wanted it censored I wouldn't buy it and just have kept my recording on my DVR!!"
1,SADLY and SAD,"I love the Family Guy series, and agree with most folks here-this is ripping fans off, big time. Not even the Live Cast reading or the special Stage show warrant a pack-in feature for this single episode - and why was it banned? Simply because of the sensitive nature of implanting, so don't expect anything better that the un-rated collections you already have. Gave it a ""1"" not because it's bad, just mis-advertised a little and was a blatant price rip-off."
2,Not worth the money!,"Ok, look, I have loved Family Guy from day one (I have all the episodes released on DVD so far). I have noticed lately though that they seem to be carrying gags too long (IMHO to use up time) and the overall quality of the writing has diminished. That said, the regular show still gets a chuckle out of me once in a while. The ONLY redeeming feature of this particular product was it's brevity. Definitely not worth the money. I suggest you only get this if you can get it for FREE. The only reason I didn't give it one star was due to my fondness of the series in general. I am hoping the upcoming star wars parody will be better."
1,"1 show for 10 dollars, not worth it.","My complaint is that it's only one show, the show itself I liked. It's just not worth 10 dollars."
1,Typical Family Guy rip-off of its fans,"The epidsode is ok, nothing out of the ordinary for family guy, except for maybe the highly touchy subject of abortion. But this epidode should be sold for no more than 2 dollars. As usual without fail, the Family Guy franchise takes another opportunity to gouge its fans for some more cash."
2,No what I was expecting,It's only 1 23 minute episode despite what the description might say. Should have been included with a box set instead. Not worth it.
2,I'm going to get a lot of flack for this but I have to say it,"I'm a big Family Guy fan to the point where I have seen pretty much all the episodes. Its no secret that there has been a drop in quality in the later seasons and while I have wanted to drop the show at several points I lack the will power to give up on it completely. Family Guy is no stranger to making bold and offensive jokes before, but they were always quick jokes their were never suppose to be episodes pro or anti anything political or religiously. I have to say that this is probably the worst Family Guy episode that I have ever seen and that's not just because of its subject matter. Being a bored 16 year old, I don't pretend to know anything about politics. Aside from being boring, and unfunny it is incredibly preachy and cringe worthy. With a ending gag so predictably unfunny that it will make you want to never watch a Family Guy episode again."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this, and granted it was my mistake for not looking at the box, I was expecting a movie length release like Stewie Griffen: Untold Story, or even a 45 minute like the Star Wars one, but instead it's one 23 minute episode, and a bad one at that. Overly Politically biased, and strong handed about it. The writers should stick to senseless jokes and not attempt to enter a moral/political debate. I've been a fan since Day 1 and never felt offended or robbed by the show or dvds, until this DVD. AVOID BUYING!!!"
1,This was not a very good episode of Family Guy and I am a fan.,"With Family Guy, there are good episodes and episodes that are not very good. This falls into the latter. I was greatly disappointed. It deals with abortion so I guess that is why it was banned from TV. There are a few funny parts, but overall it is not worth buying to get only one episode. I am not sure why it did not just end up on the season dvd."
3,Nothing special,"I can understand the controversy, I suppose. The only thing I'll say is that I'm very - very - glad I didn't pay full price for a brand new dvd. It's not worth it. If you *really* have to have this, find a good used copy for less."
3,"Good episode, lame release","The episode itself is pretty entertaining, but the whole ""banned from TV for being too extreme"" thing is bogus. Family Guy has made abortion jokes before, so this is not new territory.The disc has the bonus ""Seth and Alex"" comedy show, but content wise, it's not really worth the price. I wouldn't buy it unless you want the complete Family Guy series."
3,if you're a fan,I didn't think it was too funny but I think it's just me. I do watch Family Guy - but this wasn't what I thought it was
3,A Little Disappointed,"I am a recent FG fan. Do enjoy most of the shows and certainly looked forward to seeing this one which was ""banned"" from TV. But it was very misleading about why. It's the subject matter and not the comedic content that got it banned. Plus for the price I expected more then one 23 minute episode. I have to admit I enjoyed the comedy routine in the ""extras"" with Seth McFarlane & Alex Borstein better then the episode itself."
2,"Decent episode, not worth the money",As far as FG episodes go this one was very run of the mill. It had some funny moments but over all not worth the asking price. Apparently BBC3 aired this at one point and there are plenty of websites where it can be viewed.
1,I WON'T DO THIS AGAIN,I agree with the rest of the people. Paying 10 bucks for a half hour cartoon is a rip-off.It should have been included in volume 8.
2,Failure to laugh out loud,"I am a fan of FG. I own all 7 volumes. But this stand alone episode release left me wondering if this title warranted a lone release, over simply being included in their usual 1/2 season release. I had very few laughs and mostly felt either bored or wanting. It seemed like a message piece, rather than the usual over top satire of a very serious topic:Abortion. I usually enjoy FG dvd's repeatedly, but this one will not be viewed more than perhaps twice. It simply is NOT worth the 10.00 to own. Wait for it to be on the clearance table or used, it simply is that bad. I wanted to laugh, but couldn't even force myself. Usually FG has me cracking up throughout, but this one took itself too seriously and it failed to launch comedically. The only saving grace is the almost live special, table read, etc. Very disappointed."
2,Its good but...,"Its a good episode but it aired in the UK and that is it. Just that 1 episode with a few extras. You may want to give this a miss because of its value but for die hard fans this would be needed for your collection. (The episode is not bad it is just about abortions and surrogacy, I believe it was an over reaction)"
3,very good but expensive,"the episode is very funny, it's one of my more favorite episodes, i dont want to say what its about because i dont want to spoil the episode for those of you that want it and havent seen it, but i can honestly say i dont think its worth more than $10, i lucked out and found this at walmart in the $5 movie bin, if you can, look there before you buy it here"
4,just family guy,I don't see the hypeIt was just another episode to meWished I rented instead of purchasing
5,I love family guy,I was expecting to laugh and I did. I have yet to be disappointed with family guy and look forward to some new episodes!
4,A great marketing maneuver,"The episode lives up to the rest of the series. There is no surprise that Seth came up with a episode that Fox could not in good conscious allow to air. A die-hard fan will want to have every episode in their collection, and there is bonus material included, but as a stand alone purchase is not really worth it."
2,Corporate Greed Meets Family Guy,"It was a kick in the butt when Family Guy was no longer released in seasons, but volumes thus creating more volumes to buy. But one episode for a DVD? Absolutely ridiculous no matter how much filler material you add to it.Granted this is a very funny episode. From beginning to end, I enjoyed it, but I was smart and rented it from Netflix. The fact that they are expecting a Family Guy fan to pay $10+ for ONE episode, is corporate greed at its worst. Shame."
2,Brand overextension,"""Saints, Saviors, and Sinners"" is another meek attempt by ESPN/Disney to use their brand name in an effort to coerce the buyer into purchasing something, simply because the ESPN name is on it. I found the book to be lacking in content, and uninteresting overall. I received the book as a Christmas gift in 2003, and have read about six pages in it. Certainly not worth the $40.00 cover price.If you want a decent book profiling sportsmen, pick up one of Sports Illustrated's year-end books."
1,Worthless piece of junk,We've tried using this multiple times (it was a gift from someone) but this thing couldn't find a stud if it's life depended on it. Don't waste your money.
1,not worth the money,"We bought this stud finder at a local hardware store, mainly because it was cheap and we figured all stud finders were the same. We were so wrong. We have put so many holes in our walls because this thing is so wrong. Do not waste your money on this product. I would give it 0 stars if it were an option."
4,Did it's job,"given, it is probably not the highest quality, but from my experience, it did its job just fine the 3 times i needed to use it."
1,Not Recommended,"We also live in an older house, where hanging pictures it not a problem, but I purchased this so that I could loacte wall studs to securely attach anti-tip furniture straps to protect our toddler.I tried several times over any given area of wall, and could not get a repeatable reading. It detected studs where there was none and missed some completely. I ended up placing the dresser between 2 windows so I knew there were studs there.Recently tried it again in a different room where we have doors that slide into the wall. I discovered that I could see into the wall in the 1/2"" gap by the door, and I could determine the actual location of studs (almost 3 "" wide) with a measuring tape. This stud finder was still just as clueless."
1,Inconsistent,"If this product doesn't make you believe ""you get what you pay for"" then I don't know what will. I followed the instructions, but even then sometimes it will sense something, other times it won't... even in the same exact spot! Do it over and over again until you get even a little consistency and then go for it. You may find a stud there... or you may not. How the heck did this get past quality control? Don't waste your money on this garbage."
1,"Useless, not worth the plastic it is made of","I got the SF100 ""FREE"" with a 18 volt drill I bought at Wal-Mart. The drill works great.The stud finder is not so great. I even took a sheet of sheet rock and had my brother hold it up in the middle of the floor. There was nothing behind it and it showed studs that were not there. I placed some studs behind the sheet rock next and it missed them half the time or placed them 4 to 6 inches from where they really where. No wonder they give them away."
2,Not even a suitable substitute.,Can'r say anything good for this thing except it has a really strong magnet. Danged if I have been able to find the first stud through dry wall and only once in awhile through paneling. Don't recommend it.
1,Cannot find anything....,"I received this stud finder free in a kit with a 14V drill, which by the way rocks. It cannot locate a stud at all, the results are not repeatable or even predictable, even if I use it above an electrical outlet, where I know there has to be a stud.Do not buy this item, it is useless."
1,Uselss,"Have several stud finders - A Stanley and a Zircon, occasionally they make a mistake, both mostly right on. This Black and Decker gets it right 1 out of 100. Yes, it was cheap, but so were the others. I need several - one in each truck, one home, one tool box-because of what I do. Don't need anything fancy, but this is a joke. I have figured out how to use it though-go to the left four times and mark the beep (each one will be different). Go to right 4 times, mark as above. Find center between two outermost marks and two inner most marks. Mark each on, and measure differnce between, add difference divide by 2. mark that spot. Drive in nail. if you don't find a stud, drive nail again 1/8 inch to left. Keep driving nail at 1/8 intervals until you find a stud. This is stud edge. Meassure 3/4 in to left. This is center. Mark center. Patch holes with drywall compound.It think they have discontinued this item. Good riddance."
1,Not satisfactory,Not accurate. I drilled holes to find that there was NO stud where it said there WAS. I could've guessed just as easily. It also left black marks on the walls from the felt pads on back of product. Don't waste your money!
1,Total Piece of Garbage,"Do not waste your money on this product. I have spent the last hour trying to find studs with this, only to be completely frustrated, and have two holes in the wall with no studs behind them.Thanks Black and Decker!"
2,"Works, but only sometimes","I have no idea how thick the walls have been when I've used this tool, so chalk up my complaints to naivety if you like.I can't begin to explain how frustrating it is to find a stud's edge in one direction, but in the other direction, nothing. It's like a paradox. This stud only exists if you move right to left?? This happens over and over and over with this tool. I'm completely a layman when it comes to home repairs and handymanly work. Using this tool, I found a stud, mounted a monitor, put a little weight on it, and it pulled right out. Turns out, I was almost an entire inch away from the stud, while the whole time I assumed I was dead center inside it. Probably my mistake, but this tool did not help at all.It's not all bad, as it has accurately helped me on more than one occasion. I just have to take it's readings with a grain of salt, and usually have to do drill tests with my smallest bit, just to be certain."
3,Weekend Home Repair,I use the tools that I buy to fix things around my house and my friends and family houses. I need more good tools like this one to keep on what I'm doing.
4,"Read the directions, people!","I bought this studfinder because it was cheap and works for my needs, which is basically hanging pictures. This tool should actually be called a nailfinder because after reading the directions, it indicates that the stud is found by magnetically locating the nails which attach the drywall to the stud. So that means there may not be a nail right where you want a hole, but with a little patience, you can find a nail either above or below and use a level to indicate where you should pound to hit the stud. Pretty simple actually, IF YOU READ THE DIRECTIONS!!!"
4,Good buy,"Although I have a little trouble cleaning it as it's stretchy, I do like that it doesn't scratch, and I don't have as many problems burning things on it."
4,Not what the title suggests,"This is a film about the Fryed Brothers Band. It's a good film and worth a watch, but it isn't about motorcycles. Although the Fryed Brothers Band is a biker band, so it follows the biker lifestyle."
4,GREAT TO HEAR THE OTHER SIDE,"Loved this book, I've been following this story since it first broke, but usually only hear the Mays side of it. I feel it was written well and was fair to the case. I hope one day the persons responsiable for the switch confess, as it is apperent it wasn't accidental."
1,Extremely poorly written and biased,"Loretta Schwartz-Nobel, who helped Mary Beth Whitehead write an anti-father book about the Baby M case, has done the same for the Twiggs against Robert Mays. According to her, Mr. Mays deliberately switched his sick baby with a healthy one, whom he then raised and abused.The Twiggs are the ones who initiated the whole custody battle (just like Mary Beth), who took it to the media (just like Mary Beth), and who sued for money (just likle Mary Beth). Obviously, Ms. Schwartz-Nobel supports these actions. It is the fathers who are to blame for everything."
4,Hypocrits,"All those who have negativity for the Twiggs need to quit. They are all hypocrits that know darn good and well, had their baby been kiddnapped at birth they would look for the child to see how it was living and they might even try to have personal contact. I feel the book was well written and told the story as best it could concidering Mr. Mays would not be interviewed. The only problem I had was I too think a fallow up should be started."
3,Excuse you.,You are absolutly wrong. The twiggs lost a child and that should have been there first priority. They have other children to console over the lose of arlena. That was the child they know and love and that is want they should morn. It's alright to want to meet and maybe visit thier biological child but after 10 years to threaten to take her away from her home and family is completly dispicable. It's a 10 year old child and she doens't understand the workings of our leagal system. Now look where she is. What a mess the twiggs caused. She had a terrbile life and the press always tracking her down and no support system to resort to. She stood no chance of a normal like once the Twiggs brought the court into her life and they should be forever sorry for the damage they have caused to that poor little girl and now to her poor son who doesn't get to see his mother.
4,New style,Color quality are great but the belt loops were smaller on these pants compared to the dickies I bought previously (same style and size). I had to go out and buy a thinner belt.
5,work pants,"these pants are suited well if you need them for work. however, they are kinda stiff when you receive them. so make sure to wash them before you wear them."
4,Great workpants,Great pants. Sizing and fit perfect and flexable for carpentry work. I use the right leg rear pocket for my cell phone. I do wish Dickies would consider deeper front pockets however.
5,shipment took 4 ever OMG,"shipment took 4 ever OMG. They need to provide better shipment as in, if states that the item is on stock why take so long to get the item"
3,Good Work Pants,"My husband has been looking for sturdy work pants. These came in his inseam (36"") so he decided to try them. He ordered these and they are acceptable, but almost seem like a cross between dockers and work pants. He ended up ordering carhartt work pants from a local store and LOVES them. If you're looking for very sturdy work pants, I would suggest carhartt instead."
4,Standard Dickies,"I am sure if you are buying these you know what you are getting. They are sturdy, well made, look nice and will last forever. The double knee pants are always wider, and i find they accommodate a larger individual very well. I am a big guy, and find this style of Dickies fits me better than the originals."
4,VERY GOOD WORK PANTS,IN A PLUMBER ON MY KNEES MOST OF THE DAY THE DOUBLE KNEE REALLY HELPSWILL BUY AGAIN FOR MYSELF AND RECOMMEND TO EMPLOYEES
5,perfect for custodian,"My husband was tired of going through jeans like crazy at work, and work not replacing them. They only issue shirts. So my father, who is a mechanic, recommended these. He loves them so much and they haven't even begun to show any ware. His co workers all want me to order some for them!"
5,better than I expected,"Before I purchased these pants, I had read some pretty mixed reviews and kept going back and forth on which pair to buy. I can tell you, I love these pants! I work in retail and I do a lot of bending, kneeling, climbing, so on and so forth. These pants look great as uniform pants and the double knees make kneeling at work when stocking so much more comfortable! I will be buying a second pair!"
5,Great Pantd,Product is perfect for my work environment. They wear well and last! The loose fit makes them even better for daily work activities.
5,Darryl's Review,The pants are prefect fit. I got them a little sooner than they stated so that combined with the fit it was a great purchase.
5,perfect choice for work pants,these pants are very comfortable to wear. the pockets are deep and the legs are much larger than the regular cut ones. you will be happy you chose this item. the cell pocket is a thumbs-up.
3,Made for work,"Don't buy this for going out for a walk. These are for hard and dirty work. These are made of a super thick nylon material with a stain resistant coating which gives it a plastic-like feel and sheen.They are not particularly comfortable. The front of the waist is not contour cut, so it feels very high. If you like the front of the waist low, beware the it's cut on the same level as the back and these will be hanging around your butt-crack level (and the pant legs will be dragging on the ground), else be prepared to wear them like Steve Urkel... might as well get suspenders for them to keep them that high.I wish work clothes would be made a little more comfortable. It only makes me want to rip it off and put on my normal casual clothes once I don't have to wear it.Also note that this comes with an odd (foul earth) smell from the factory that takes a few washes and a lot of airing out to get rid of."
5,Great Pants,My husband used to wear these when he had a hard on the knees job and now he wears them to his office job because they are so comfortable
4,Great for Construction work,My husband is in excavating/pipe laying and he loves these pants for work. Lighter and less cumbersome than denim and stronger too.
3,Good Work Pants.,"Very good work pants, in fact they are just about all I wear. My only complaint is that they tend to chafe on the inner thigh and wear out in that area. Quite often i am needing to replace them, not because, for the most part, that the pants are worn out, or torn, but because the inner thigh now have holes in them. So, that is a pain. But other then that, they are good work pants. I just wish i could get more then 4 months out of them for what they cost me."
5,Dickies Are Great,I love the Dickies work pants I ordered from Amazon. They fit great and are so very comfortable. The price cannot be beat either.
4,"Good, but","First off, the pants are REALLY stiff out of the package. They become more flexible with washing. Secondly, order a size larger than normal. They run small.PROS:They are tough! I am really tough on work pants. These will last.No ironing needed! I hate ironing and I don't think I will ever need to iron these. Never a sign of a crease. =)I love the extra pocket on the side near the knee. I tend to put my keys here.CONS:As previous stated, they run a size small.The red tag of the side of the knee and the stitching around the knee makes the pants look a bit odd. Where I am currently working they are fine, but I would not have been able to wear these pants to other places I have worked because they have a bit of a work in progress or unfinished look.Overall I like these pants. I wish they had a more finished look so they presented more professionally. I will stick with Dickies, but probably try a different style next time."
3,good work pants.,"I work retail, and go through pants faster than socks. I had a pair of these before. I liked them a lot, they were comfy and strong and had a useful side pocket. I agree with the guy that said the belt loop is too big, I wear my keys there all the time on every pair of pants a own. These I had to put a key ring through the loop I wanted my keys on, then hook to that.The thing I didn't like about these was a huge issue, enough to stop wearing them sometimes. I walk to work, and while I had these it took 30 minutes to get there. If it was raining (umbrella or not) these pants would soak up the water like I dunked them in a pool and quickly put them on. They held so much, I had to ring them out when I got to work. If I didn't they would take hours to dry.If you drive to work, and aren't even in the rain long get these pants. These were the best fitting pants I have found to this day, sadly though I still walk to work."
4,dickies loose fit,"Nice pants,convenient side pocket.heavy material & uncomfort to wear outside aircond area.maybe good for wearing at construction site when its spring or winter."
4,Great fit and lightweight,These pants fit great and are much lighter than jeans. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is I want to see how quickly/slowly they wear out. The double knees make me think they will last quite a while.
4,Over Packaging,"I've always liked this line of clothing strong and sturdy,i've worn Dickies shirts and pants for couple of years now and they are by far better than any thing else.But here's my problem it,s the packaging the box the pants came in was far bigger than necessary it could hold at least five more, who ever did the packaging could used a smaller box since it was just one work pant."
4,Runs small,"These run a bit small in the waste, maybe by one size. The length was perfect and they appear to be of high quality."
3,not the same old dickies,these pants do not feel like the old pairs of dickies i had previously owned. the material feels rougher and thinner. the overall quality of these pants just don't feel like your typical dickies.
4,Great Quality,"I bought these pants for motorcycle riding. They have the double knee when protects my legs from the stones on the highway. They are very durable and never wrinkle after washing. I have them in several colors. Very comfortable fit, and I am a woman!"
5,Work,"These work pants can be put to work right away and for a long time. I have these jeans for about a month now. I fix large engines and I have put these jeans through hell. Spilt oil, grease, lubrication etc all over these pants. After my wife washes the jeans, they still come out looking like new."
5,Dickies 85-283 Double Knee Work Pant Black 34W x 34L,"Great! Just what my 21 year old grandson needed for work! Although I mistakenly ordered 34L, as he wears 32L, he didn't want to return them.They are hard to find.He actually likes the extra length. Way to go Amazon!"
4,Geoff makes a great move without The Distance.,"After listening to this new CD I was taken back by the depth and searching that many of the tracks on this new CD. Gone is a lot of fluff seen in some his previous CD's and in place is a soul searching, Gospeling reflecting group of songs. In a much mellower GM than we have heard of lates, we can see the influence of his friend SCC. The lyrical and musical quality is seen here in this work. I was a little worried in buying this CD, but am so thankful that I did."
1,Extremely tedious,"Why would the women in this film keep falling for Matthew Perry? He walks around with a mental condition that leaves him emotionally numb. His expression throughout is blank. He offers nothing. So that made no sense. Also, there is no plot, only Perry trying to get himself cured through shrinks and drugs. This was really quite boring, and I had to pause it often over two days just to say I finished watching it."
2,Numb and Number,This was quite an unsatisfying movie. I bought it because of Matthew Perry and the description made it sound like a drama/comedy. Unfortunately there was nothing funny about it. Most of the acting was flat and at times the story line was so boring that I fast forwarded.
2,Treo Sync Cable,I had problems with my PC recognizing my Treo with the cable. After spending considerable time in configuration I finally got it to work.
1,Not a Treo accessory,"This cable is an accessory for another Palm product that happens to ""fit"" the Treo. But it doesn't have a hotsync button on it (you have to use the hotsync icon on the Treo). No big deal, but in my case it didn't work and I had to return it. I do not believe this should be marketed as a Treo accessory--it even comes tagged with the name of another Palm product."
2,Very poor design,"low price, poor design item.it does not mate securely with my treo making connecting it an ""art.""pay more for a real treo connector."
1,"Doesn't work, so far...","I received the product quickly and the price was great. However, I can't get it to work. It fails to connect my phone to my PC. I have a tech support ticket logged at SFPlanet. We'll see if they can help."
1,Palm Treo Cable,The cable I received is not the one pictures and would not work with the Plam Treo 650. I am unsure of what it was for.
1,hotsync cable,"does not connect handheld to the desktop most of the time. it does charge the handheld, but more than that, no."
3,"CD label misleading, but still a good listen!","Chris Ho has been playing back up for Smokey Robinson on his tours for many years. Now he's ventured on his own with this solo CD. He recorded this album back in 1998. It's a nice mix of different styles of Jazz, with influences from Spyro Gyra and The Yellowjackets. ""Dark Heroes"" and ""Bada Be Bim Bop"" are the highlight tracks on this CD. The only problem I had with the CD was the album cover. It says, ""featuring Smokey Robinson"" right on the cover. That had me thinking there would be plenty of vocals from the Motown legend. Unfortunately, he only appears on one track and that only featured background vocals. It's a let down that the listener should be aware of before getting their hopes up. Despite the shortcoming, the CD is a pleasant listen. Recommended!"
2,Prehistoric throwback in the modern gaming world,"If you're on a budget and are building a business machine this mobo is probably okay, but it's pretty crappy by today's standards. In short, look elsewhere, it's an old card.I have one in my Visionman system which I bought nearly 4 years ago. It's got a year or two left at most before it sees the recycling machine. Everything else in my rig is okay, the mobo is the only serious weak link, and I mean serious."
2,Dated and problematic,"If you just want to read the Hermetica, read Brian Copenhaver's translations, which are much better than Scott's. And of course, these aren't by Sir Walter Scott (of Ivanhoe fame) anyway, if you're interested in him for some reason, but by a quite different Walter Scott.Scott's translations are still valuable for the specialist. You should be able to find used copies of the trade paperback edition (Hermes House, at one point), though, which are rather better bound than these Kessinger xeroxes.If you have Copenhaver, you'll probably want these, although I'd recommend a different printing."
4,Nice volcano- immediate satisfaction.,"This volcano was a big hit. I read the enclosed booklet to my kids about the different types of volcanos. That was short enough but informative enough- just right. We separated the two parts of the volcano and talked about what each part of the labeled side does. Then we errupted it. That was the ONLY part that was a wee bit disappointing and I think that the reason for it was that we followed the recipe for lava in the booklet. That contained liquid dish soap. I think the dish soap slowed down the flow. It was probably more realistic that way, but not quite as exciting. Next time, we will leave the soap out. Overall, it was pretty good."
3,Amazing educational resource but...,"Because my 6 years old's son is a curious pre-scientific, I thought a real volcano (volcano model) could nourish his always thinking mind. However, the volcano was amazing just the first time he saw it. We make an eruption at the follow day and another one in the follow one. That's it! Now the box is standing in my room formally ""inactive"". As a teacher, I wondering if it could be a good experience for my students at school, but I don't know yet if for 3 years old could provide the same emotions than for a 5-6 years child. The information inside the model is more for older ones. For educational resource, it will help but for a regular present for your children (it doesn't matter how scientific they are) won't be a good-excited idea."
5,The Perfect Illustration for Jesus Blowing Away Our Sins,Sunday school and Vacation Bible School kids love the volcano. I label the baking soda as Sin and the red colored vinegar as the Blood of Jesus. They are able to see what the blood of Jesus does for our sins when we allow Him to be our Savior. They Get It. It is awesome when I find an illustration that sticks in the kids minds and explains Christ's love and salvation for us so well. I will use the volcano over and over again. Priceless!!!
3,Gergiev is Too Busy,"I bought this recording with great expectations. What could be a better combination that Gergiev and Shostakovitch performed by the finest Russian orchestra of today? Unfortunately the music-making is half-hearted. It is rhythmically slack and intensity varies greatly from blinding white heat to let's just get through this. As always Gergiev has some fascinating moments (check out the last oboe solo in the Mvmt. II of the fifth) but I think he is just simply too busy to put his whole heart in to any particular project. I remember reading that the ninth was recorded in the middle of the night as well. This is not the greatest of conditions for creating an exceptional performance. All in all, a disapointment."
4,Children can make a difference-and so can you!,"The realities pictured in this book can be scary, but they touch on the truth about our ever-growing environmental problems that need real solutions and real people to solve them!Children have the power to have a profound impact on the future of our environment and this book allows them to know that hope exists if every child lends a helping hand. Parental guidance should accompany initial reading of the book to help answer questions. This book would make an excellent addition to personal collection or classroom library!"
5,RENT THIS MOVIE! ITS WORTH THE SEE!,The movie just makes you look at the ridiculous lives of the film crew! Yet everything reaks of reality. Just the crazy way the world goes! It made me sit back and think of the people who were filming this movie and the chaos behind the scenes. It is a nice movie w\ colorful twists and superb directing! Again its a display of great acting!
5,Reality of film-making,"One phrase sums up this film -- ""Living in Oblivion"" is to film-making what ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is to the music industry. An honest, and humorous look at what really goes on behind the scenes in the business. Yup, it's soooo glamorous! A must-see for those who want to get into the biz, and pure entertainment for those already in it! An awesome gift idea for anyone who works in film production -- what a trip!"
5,Hostess twinky mother f**ker,"This is a great movie. A tribute to all independent filmmakers. It's a stereotypical satire about a stereotypical low budget film shoot. The clapperboard, the week old milk and the obviously high camera focus guy. The movie portrayed frustration prefectly, not just frustration in making movies but in relationships and life overall.As always Steve Buscemi is awesome. Buy this movie!!!!"
3,"Good individual scenes add up to a big ""who cares?""","This film concerns the professional, artistic, and personal struggles of the crew trying to make a small independent feature. It has an innovative structure and good performances, as well as many fine individual sequences. I particularly enjoyed the way writer / director Tom DiCillo dissects the interpersonal and mechanical foul-ups that lead to many flubbed scenes. I also felt that he provided us with an unglamorized look at the way films are really made. However, in the end it seemed like too much of an inside story. I didn't really care whether their film got made or not."
2,"Indie navelgazing, strictly for groupies","Some indie films are good, but who wants to watch a film about indie filmmaking? Living in Oblivion told me way more than I ever wanted to know about the world of indie film, and did it in a way that wasn't funny or evocative or convincing or any other quality that might make me watch something. This is kind of the George magazine of indie film, all gossip and no substance. Basically a waste of time."
3,Not what I hoped for. Much worse.,"I love the odd art film and had many people recommend this film. It just didn't work for me. I love most of the actors in it and tried really hard to see the funny but I just found it dull and below amateurish in execution. Thank God for Peter Dinklage; he gave me the few laughs I got from the entire production.Sometimes low budget is just low quality as well. Fortunately, most of the good actors here have moved on to far better fare."
1,Living in a brain-splattered bloody living room from the shotgun blast to my mouth..,"I firmly state that this touches the highest level of cinematic genius; right next to Too Wong Foo, Thanks for everything Julie Newmar...."
4,Hilarious film about making films,"This is the only film I have view about filmmaking. It is about a strugling director that tries to make a movie on a very low budget. Steve Buscemi is an exellent choice for a film director, and we become a part of his every day life. We follow him through all the problems you can imagine, and more. This film gives you an accurate picture of what it is like in the filmindustry. Unless your're a part of making blockbuster movies with unlimited budgets. Which this movie so clearly isn't. It is a very funny movie, that you must see if you are interessted in what filmmaking is all about."
4,A challenge to us,"This movie brings the reality of war right into one's living room. My initial reaction was how can we as humans resort to such savagery. The reality is that war seems to be a necessary evil where freedom is threatened. One asks if there couldn't be a better way - I don't know if there is an answer to this question.The last few lines of the film were deep - it calls us to ask of ourselves the same question - are/have our lives been worthy of the sacrifice made on our behalf - by men and woman who have gone before and fought for freedom and then by the sacrifice of Jesus trading His sinless life for our sinful one.We will need to give an account for our lives one day. Please spend your life building something that will last, that you may have an offering that has lasting (eternal) value.All in all a good movie - the violence is quite graphic but I guess this is how it was and therefore is not gratuitous."
5,The best DVD to date in audio and visual quality,"I was overly impressed with the quality of sound and audio in Saving Private Ryan. This is the new standard for audio and video on DVD. In fact, I enjoyed the DVD more than I did the movie! The colors and image quality are simply breathtaking and sound will knock you out of your seat. This is a must buy for any DVD owner. I only wish that Spielberg would have included a director's commentary along with the DVD. Maybe one day he will do this. Bring on more Spielberg DVDs!"
3,Great Effects... but what's with the camera???,"the movie in my honest opinion was great, effects-wise that is... as for the storyline, well.. there could have been a little more character development, but i guess with all that war going on, one can't think/react much....my only complaint, the first 30 minutes (and practically the rest of the movie) nearly made me throw up, and it wasn't because of the blood or gore... it was because of the damn WAVERING camera angle!!!! if you can't play doom or quake cos you get nauseous... beware of the ""lack of focus"""
5,DAMN!,"Damn! That is the word to describe this movie. This movie was moving, touching, violent, and deplicted the images of war, and that we should appreciate our elders who served back in World War II."
3,"Great Movie, Good Extras, Fair DVD Quality","While I believe that this is one of the greatest movies of the 1990's, I am somewhat disappointed by the picture quality. In early battlefield scenes, the picture is grainy (supposed to be like that for ""realism""? I don't remember the film that way), white specs in a scene toward the end, and the worst layer change I've ever encountered (slow and right in the middle of a scene). The special features are very good, and the movie superb, but I wish they did a better job on video transfer."
4,Resurrection of WWII Action Genre,"Excellent film about a team of Rangers during World War II who are ordered to find the sole survivor of four brothers after the Army learns that three have been killed in combat. Set in France, 1944, the movie opens with the a company of the 2d Ranger Battalion and soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division assaulting Dog Green Sector on Omaha Beach, and follows the Ranger team's dangerous search in enemy territory to locate Private Ryan who parachuted in with the 101st Airborne Division. This feature is famous for its D-Day sequence, which established a new standard for realism with detailed production values that propel viewers into WWII."
2,Problem with DTS version,I have Panasonic A310 and I have problem playing the DTS version. The sound and video drops out and forget about chapter 12. The sound and video drops out the picture freezes. It has problems going through the menu also. Amazon was really good about getting me a replacement but the second one does the same thing. I have DTS of Apollo 13 which plays fine. I'm taking both disk and trying it at the local hifi shop to see if it's my player.
5,An Outstanding Film!,"The most impressive aspect of this film was Mr. Spielberg's attention to detail and penchant for realism. The unabashed slaughter of both Allied and Axis troops throughout the film was horrendous, really showing everyone the evils of war and the price that Allied soldiers paid to rid Europe of Hitler's oppression. The sound quality on this DTS DVD is incredible. I had to turn down the gain on my subwoofer to keep the dishes from rattling! I would like to see Mr Spielberg use his filmmaking savvy to make a similar movie about the U.S. Marines in the WWII Pacific Theater, perhaps the battle for Iwo Jima."
4,OVERRATED,"The scenes of wartime violence are effective and realistic, but it isn't enough to make a movie great. There isn't enough to the movie besides the violence. That doesn't mean the movie is pointless, but the violence takes up too much running time. The scene at the beginning works but the scene of violence at the end is overlong. O.K. war is hell,we get the point. Problem 2: the characters and their journey for the most part aren't exactly memorable. Problem 3: the characters are too modern, THIS MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO! Problem 4: the movie offers little (if any) insight as to what led up to the D-day invasion. Speilberg didn't bother to set up the situation or the characters. In spite of it's problems, it is a very good one and worth seeing, but IT ISN'T GREAT."
3,huh?,"WHy do people love this movie so much? Besides the battle scenes, what was there? I admit i loved the fighting scenes. THe last battle i didn't understand. I mean why didn't they just blow up the bridge before the germans came if that was the plan anyway. I may have missed something, only seen the film once. But it all seemed pointless. Still a great fight though.Also a major throw back is that the movie glorifies the idea that it's good to kill people; even if you have a good reason.Those same americans that fought for our greater good were evil also. Taking orders to kill. If you want a good war movie see the other war movie that came out the same year. One less ""realistic"". Or any other war movie. Cuz this isn't close do being the best ever."
3,some great scenes but too many awful scenes,"The 2 battle scenes at the beginning and end of this movie are just incredible filmmaking feats by Spielberg and company and one should have this movie just to see them. And Tom Hanks is great, as he usually is.But there are serious problems in other places. Some examples: the opening in the cemetary is a cheat, Private Ryan's obviously ad-libbed ""ugly tree"" scene is a disgrace and having Miller even consider not accomplishing his mission at the end was a terrible plot judgment by Spielberg.I haven't seen too many movies that have left me divided between admiration and dislike as SPR, so the best advice I can give is that it's definitely worth owning and probably no one short of Spielberg's genius could have assembled it, but program a ""good parts"" version into your DVD player. Give him a huge amount of credit for making such a difficult and brutal movie when he could be taking it so much easier."
2,"technically accurate, but boring","This is one of the most boring movies from the most hyped and pretentious director of our time. If you sometimes like movies just for their technical achievements then this won't let you down, that is if you can stomach the dizzying first-person camera work. Someone needs to tell Mr. $pielberg that a person's head tends to compensate for movement quite a bit better than his ""realistic"" camera work is supposed to portray. Finally, the characters are more ""wooden"" than Al Gore, which is a serious disservice to our underappreciated vets."
3,"Good Action, Nice Concept, Major Story Line Flaw","The beach front scene is riveting and very realistic. It speaks well of the horror these brave men faced so many years ago.This concept of saving Private Ryan, a paratrooper who has lost his three brothers almost in an instant is a great motive for telling this type of story.Remember however, Private Ryan is a paratrooper who lands sveral miles behind enemy lines; no day in the park. However, he never was at nor experienced the landing on Normandy Beach. Therefore I ask, how can Private Ryan as a veteran visiting the Normandy grave sites have a flash back so compelling and realistic of that battle? He was never there. This is a major story line flaw I am sorry to say."
1,Horrible,"Dopey World War II movie with Friday the 13th style special effects, (...) and inaccurate weapons information.Try banging a 60mm mortar round's primer(base) on something, your hand will be blown off."
2,"Blu-ray 2 stars, Movie 5 stars ... video issues","This is the second copy I had to return, bad video transfer still exists on Blu-ray. For example at 2hr 35mins there is a ""halo"" or glow around the actors. Would like a replacement but w/ a good copy. Thank you Amazon for sending out recall notice, but problem still not fixed."
3,"Good, but not great","Okay, the first twenty minutes of this movie will have you glued in your chair in awe of the spectacle that is Saving Private Ryan, but lets face it, the rest is just empty filler. The cast goes somewhere, gets by a problem. Then they do it 10 more times. S.P.R. is better than most war movies our there but it's better a rental than anything. I mean, who has the time, or would just want to, see a 3 and a half hour movie a second time around."
2,Your Typical Hollywood War Film,"Even if one overlooks the glaring historical inaccuracies in this film, Saving Private Ryan is your basic Spielberg war epic, nothing more, nothing less: John Williams' crescendos every fifteen minutes, a few ridiculous utterly unbelievable circumstances (the roomful of Germans exposed by the collapsed wall), predictable bloodshed (the troops getting butchered immediately upon landfall), on and on and on. I don't doubt Spielberg's good intentions here. And to his credit, some of the shots are outstanding. The erratic frame-rate during the beachhead was particularly well executed. But the incredible, overwhelming patriotic slant of the film itself is ultimately bogus and unrewarding. This film plods along beside the antiquated Hollywood propaganda films of yesteryear (albeit with modern gore), it achieves nothing more than its predecessors."
2,Seen It Before! By Far Not the Best War Movie,"I have seen many great war movies from Full Metal Jacket to Glory and both have given the tremendous aspects of war. For Full Metal Jacket, it was the grittiness of the General(not 100% sure of his rank), for Glory it was strong about racism. But in Saving Private Ryan, I've seen it all and the open scene really set the tone for a dull movie with no special theme. Were soldiers really that stupid back then? Okay, fine, they're looking for Private Ryan just for American pride. I think you can get that American pride from many Hollywood movies. I'm not saying it's a totally horrible film but if you're going to make me sit for 3 hours, I better see something new. I think Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise are great actors; they just need a new script with a promising plot."
5,DVD Movie - Saving Private Ryan,"Hi,Thank you very much, i have received the DVD movie. Packing and shipping was in a excellent condition, Disc nor the box was damaged when received.I trust the Amazon products, very genuine and good at Customer Care!Regards,Keshava RajuBangalore, INDIA."
1,Cut versons,"LET THE BUYER BEWARE! I recently purchased a copy of Saving Private Ryan from an online store. I received a cut version and am very disappointed. There are no times listed in the descriptions so the buyer is unaware of whether this is a full or cut version of the movie. The current online store (Amazon) does not list the length of the movie. Therefore, how do I know which version I am getting? Do I buy another one and pay the shipping to return it? If I buy enough of them on line, the return shipping costs will more than equal my time to go to a video store and purchase the correct version."
1,DVD was scratched/damaged,"Fast shipping, but the DVD's scratches cause it to pause during the action scene in the beginning of the movie,which is why I bought it in the first place. It's not even worth the time and money sending it back...but I am sorely disappointed."
2,saving private ryan,I puchased Saving Private Ryan and the dvd does not play It states the dvd is not good i would like to return it and recieve another
1,Special Limited Edition Rip-off,"This is an awesome movie! However, this ""widescreen"" DVD is not as it would seem. Most widescreen DVDs display more information on screen than pan & scan DVDs as the widescreen aspect ratio is like the theater. On this DVD, the widescreen version actually CUTS information from the top and bottom of the pan & scan picture. I learned this watching the movie on cable, noting that while talking about his shaking hands in the church, CPT Miller's hands are on screen (and shaking) for more of the discussion--on the DVD, not so! Perhaps the ""five-star"" video production team should obtain James Cameron's essay on widescreen v. pan & scan and learn that the selection of aspect ratio and production should not detract from the finished product. Again, a great movie, but this edition left me quite disappointed and wondering how much else was disregarded."
2,Slow Moving - not one of Tom Hank's better movies,"Personally of you're looking for a good war movie I'd suggest Midway over this. Had a hard time staying awake, didn't think the film ever came close to all of the hype about it. Went away think what a waste of film, effort, time, and money."
2,One of the most overrated movies ever.,"So many cliches, where to begin? When I first saw this I heaped praise on this movie, calling it best war movie ever, etc. etc. Now I'm older and wiser, and more demanding of what a movie should offer, and I realize: this is a mediocre war movie sandwiched between two great fight scenes. And those were great fight scenes. The stuff in between was a either ok or a yawn fest."
2,Boring and pretentious,"Yes, the opening scene at Omaha Beach is riveting. The problem is, they put it at the beginning of the movie, and it's all downhill from there. The rest of the movie is mostly a mishmash of contrived dialogue, forced acting, and cornball speeches. I find its depiction of war quite inaccurate, with its apparent message that war ennobles its participants and brings out the best in soldiers (and includes lots of moving oratory by guys like Tom Hanks). Quite simply, that isn't true. I found ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" to be much more accurate portrayals of the psychological impact of war. And while the opening battle scene is good, if I want a ton of violence, I'll watch the far more entertaining ""Commando."""
2,"Scratched, skipped parts of movie...","The movie of course is... ...well amazing, but the disk is scratched up, and I have to fast forward past parts of the movie. Of course, that's what I get for buying used... Haha"
3,Over Rated,This movie is over rated. It is Ok but was not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar and not worth the 9.95 I paid for it.
5,As real as it gets,"Steven Spielburg did an outragous job with this DVD making it reach out to the people. It made those of us who were not in WWII realize how scary and bloody it got. Every War has its casualties, but if your not there to witness it first hand you never know how bad it got. This movie is as close as you get to the truth. Gettysburg and Saving Private Ryan are the only movies I've ever seen that could even compare to the real thing. I can only imagine what it must have been like. A must see for every American."
5,Excellent war movie,"I have seen some war movies and most focus on winners and losers. This movie focuses on the tragedy of the human loss, particular for the parents who loose all their sons to war. The movie initially takes you through the horror of D-Day but then moves the focus on the army's conscience for doing the right, respectful thing for a family that has lost 3 our of 4 sons all in one go. This brought me into a deep state of reflective emotion, I really felt for the mother of those young brothers, but equally for the 8 soldiers that risked everything they had to save one man, who was the forth and only remaining son. I can now say I better understand the tragic horror of war and the lengths that some of the soldiers went to to save others. It has been 4 days now since I have viewed the movie and I am still reflecting on it!"
3,he did it again,"Aside from the hypnotic battle scenes, I don't think this film broke any new ground. The dialouge is recycled and predictable, the characters way oversimplified and oozing with setiment. Under all the so-called heady realism of this movie is a plot from the Muppets. Spielburg should take a break from kissing the audiences' butts--telling it like it was involves more than just an intricate set--the characters need to be developed as well. In my opinion, this movie is all about humanity, but not human beings."
3,"""Realistic"" Scenes Don't Necessarily Make a Good Movie","Yes, the invasion sequence at the beginning is probably one of the most realistic depictions of combat ever put on film. So what? I don't believe that the realism of the film makes it great. The whole premise of the movie is incredibly contrived--the idea that a special team would be sent in to pull Pvt. Ryan out in the whirl and muddle of the Normandy invasion. Some of the dialog, too, was incredibly silly, i.e., a GI saying to his captain, ""So, by saving Ryan, we're saving ourselves."" And in a film that prided itself on ""realism,"" what's with the P-51 ""tankbusters""? (Leftovers from ""Empire of the Sun,"" perhaps?) While SPR has done much to commemorate the sacrifices of the WWII generation, and to create an awareness of that generation as it fades, the movie itself is only fair."
3,One overrated movie...,"It angered me that just because Spielberg puts his name on a movie, it is considered a great film. Sure the battle scene at the beginning of the movie is impressive, but it honestly has nothing to do with the plot. It seems as if the movie is actually a documentary tacked onto the beginning of the actual film. Oh well..."
2,The Greatest war movie I think NOT.,"ok let me get this straight how is Ryan with the remembering all this when he doesn't even show up untill the end of the film? Anyone?And what's with letter Honest Abe wrote. It was so sad, I almost cried.And after a great battle scene it gets worst. After finding Ryan they find he wants to stay. And then Tom and his group of complainers decide, hey why don't we stay too. If you want to watch a good war movie check out:Thin Red Line, Paths of Glory, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and many others I'm leaving out."
5,Best Movie Ever,"I personaly think that Saving Private Ryan is the best movie i have ever seen. Before i saw it I could not handle blood and gore but when my friend convinced me to see it i was not offended at all. It really gives you a feel for some of the feelings that i am sure soliders felt during the war. Excellently casted and directed, Saving Private Ryan is and forever will be the best movie I have ever seen."
2,It is one of the best war movies made...,But it still is a war movie and as such it is for people who like war movies. I personally do not so my opinion is very subjective. In my opinion the movie showed the war as it is with very high detail and would probably be recommended to people who have no problem with watching people loosing their arms and legs with a lot of blood everywhere. The idea of the movie was really good but there was too much blood for me.
5,This is a movie that everyone should see!,"I give this movie a 5 star rating and think that you will do the same. We take advantage of our daily freedoms and sometimes, we just need to be put right back into reality! It will make you take more time and give more love to yours and your community."
1,bad movie,"This is probably the worst war movie I have ever seen, yes, the first part of the movie was amazing but the movie went down hill from there. What was the worst was the scene with the German guy getting arrested and forced to dig a ditch singing ""I say can you see"" (a mockery of our anthem); then it's very ironic that Ryan - a private - ignored the ordered from Chief of Staff General Marshall to return home, and nobody did anything to punish Ryan for disobeying a direct order, this among other mistakes makes this movie, in my opinion, the worst WW2 movie ever. If you look for WW2 movies try: THE LONGEST SAY, A BRIDGE TO FAR, PATTON, MIDWAY, and other movies from the 70s and 80s"
1,"Boring, not realistic","First of all, any movie with Vin Diesel should tell you right off the bat that it's gonna be bad. And this movie is BAD. Spielberg was always a pretty overrated director. This movie isn't as bad as ""E.T.,"" but it's not realistic. The first 20 minutes look like a PlayStation movie. For a more accurate depiction of the horrors of war, check out the amazing ""Pearl Harbor"" with Ben Affleck."
1,Profitable Propaganda,"This video will be very popular among those who enjoy dressing their grown children in doughboy uniforms and listening to Connie Francis LP's which smell vaguely of mothballs. The play acting of a guilt ridden baby boomer, whose only beach he has stormed is the property in his front yard, when jogging with noted war criminal Bill Clinton, as one of the Nuremberg prosecutors described him."
2,Yawn...,"Got moved by the fact a mother lost three sons and the fourth and last is about to be saved. (Earns a star.)Sappy.Patriotic propaganda.Good battle scenes. (Earns another star.)To much of the good guys and the bad guys.Watch ""The thin red line"".Gives you a punch in the tummy and you'll feel it for a long time.Private Ryan you'll forget the minute you leave the theater or turn of your DVD player."
2,?ONE GOOD AMERICAN?,"Never mind the improbability of the movie's premise.--->Note the fact that only American troops are depicted committing war crimes and atrocities.<---The singular moral-compass of the film is shot dead. One good American?What was the message? The motivation other than money (mission accomplished) and entertainment (DOA, once off the beach)? Thus, the agenda?"
1,Hollywood at its usual worst,"How can a movie with so much violence, blood, and profanity be so well liked by a ""Christian"" society? I don't care how supposedly accurate this movie portrayed the soldiers emotions and conditions, they still shouldn't have been so immoral. This is America, the Christian nation, founded by God, and ruled by the lord Jesus Christ. Cursing and swearing are not good Christain activities, and I just don't agree with their glorification of these things. For a real movie about a battle you should all watch Left Behind, based on the books written by Tim and Jerry. They are great and they tell the story of the rapture which is sure to be coming soon with filth like this being shown in todays homes. Instead of Saving Private Ryan maybe you should all try saving yourself in the eyes of the almighty lord. Praise be to Jesus!! More Christians need to stand up and do the lords work and get rid of ideas other than ours!!"
5,powerful,What a powerful film. It is a reminder that good people gave their lives so that we could have what we have today. Freedom. It would be a different world had they not.
5,Saving Private Ryan,An excellent film...Tom Hanks at his best!! A moving touching story..not for children..
2,"Great combat scenes, but an idiotic story","Yeah, the combat scenes in this movie are second to none (or rather were second to none prior to the release of ""We Were Soldiers."") But the story is unbelievable and silly. I found it a real slap in the face to the U.S. Army's Rangers that this film potrays them as whiners who constanly question their CO, argue with him, and blatantly disobey orders."
4,GORY!,"This is a great movie. But parent beware. If you are letting children see this, don't let them see the first and last half-hour of the movie. It is a sad depressing exageration of the saying ""War is Hell."" But Spielberg is very artistic, and after seeing this The president might never want to declare war again."
3,I expected more... not to say this wasn't a great movie!,"don't get me wrong, this movie was a wonderful movie and very vivid as to the horrors of war, but after all the hype that it got i expected more. somehow it seemed drug out between the time Hanks takes on the mission of finding Damon's character and when he finally does find him. i found my mind wondering in this period, but my attention was once again grabbed when they finally found private ryan and they began planning what could possibly have been their final stand. overall i enjoyed the movie."
3,Impressive Special Effects,"Much better on the big screen, you'll get the feeling after the first minutes of this film that it's going to be long. And after three hours it certainly is. Yes it sends messages, but so did Platoon, Hamburger Hill and Casualties of War. Tom Hanks does his usual superb acting job; this time he's Captain of a young and energetic platoon with more guts than glory as we watch one after another suffer unspeakable mutilation on the battlefield. Matt Damon is Private Ryan, but displays none of the screen charm and eye catching talent of his Good Will Hunting role. The messages are clear that war is brutal and senseless and inhuman and horrid, but after seeing the film three times I'm thinking that Saving Private Ryan is more about showcasing spectacular special effects (Normandy Beach scenes) than about anything else. Watch and see if you don't agree."
5,Most realistic WWII film to come along in some time.,"Being a WWII history buff, I really liked the fact it showed how it really was and not just the ""John Wayne, we canwin anything and the enemy are all dumb"" like a lot of movies about that time did. I can't wait for it to be releasedon video. I hope other studioes will realize when you recreate something on screen you have to make it as realistic as possible."
4,"""Best opening half hour in Cinema History""","Saving Private Ryan suffers mainly from the fact that the film offers two great indivdual scenes the opening half an hour (the greatest opening in cinema history) and the closing fight against the German forces. The Tanks even hinting before the fight something out of a certain Dino movie.(The shaking of rubble, a glass of water see the connection). Still apart from all this Saving Private Ryan suffers from lack of interest in the middle section nothing really to get your teeth into for the rest of the hour, it's O.k but we are talking about a Speilberg film. Tom Hank's is O.k, but he is outcasted by his fellow actors on this film. Still the film as I said breaks down to a film with impressive opening and closing scenes and not much else. Still how can I pick at a director who can produce scenes of this quality. STILL SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE WAS BETTER!."
3,Nice pick up,good price. quality no so much. Prime is not as good as Netflix in terms of quality in my opinion.
3,Deserves 3 1/2 stars,"this movie wasnt bad at all. and to tell the truth that begening battle was one of the best I had ever seen. 3.5 stars to me isnt a bad movie.. I just dont feel its worth the own, I got this movie right when it came out and have only watched it once and did a partiel viewing of it another time. I think you will be satisfied with renting this movie.. buying it however, well maybe if its on sale."
5,Upclose look at D-Day,"This film is an honest portrayal of the D-Day landing and the extraordinary sacrifices made by by everyday men. Speilberg's filming technique on this movie, makes you feel like you were there (and glad you were not.) The depiction of the landing on Normandy Beach is one the most intense battle scenes I have ever seen.Spielberg has not only paid a deserving tribute to the veterans of World War II, he has also produced an excellent anti-war film that shows the true horror of warfare. There was nothing romantic about going to war. I feel he captured what it was like to invade the beaches on June 6th."
4,"riveting, intense, brutal reality seen through our own eyes","the movie was so intense that it made me physically sick knowing that so many good men died so courageously during a time when america was its peak in the world community and had the resourses and power to win a war without self-rightousness and greed for power, but alieve oppresion and tyranny by communists and fascism."
5,If I should die...,"It doesn't get any more real than this, unless you dig a hole and get shot at. I know, I've been there. Well done Spielberg."
5,Good War Flick,Not much else can be said from all the other reviews. It is a good WWII film. An excellent begining to the film with scenes depecting Omaha Beach and the tragic lose of life by the American troops for France (the ungrateful bastards). A good story of honor and commitment by WWII soldiers and the irony of war and the value of life. Good acting and excellent combat scenes. Enjoy and remember what our forefathers have sacrificed.
5,"Fantastic Movie, incredible sound! Issue on some scenes?","This is a must-buy for your blu-ray and home theatre systems, enough said. I have a question to anyone on here who may be able to answer. There are some scenes where the video doesn't look right.1. The Omaha beach scene, when they capture the beach, the fires that are burning seem to stretch or glow beyond where they actually are.2. Near the end when Upham finally captures those Germans and shoots the one they let go. That scene to where he is just standing there, there is this white haze that glows and streches all over.Anyone know what these could be from? Is this how it supposed to be?I'm using the PS3 for watching, every other part of the movie is flawless."
5,Sapphire Saves Private Ryan With High-Def!,"Right away on the opening action scene where the soldiers land on Omaha Beach, the audio stands out and is crisp, clear and amazingly active. Bullets whiz by with a sound that is sweet until you see and hear them hitting bodies, grenades and land-mines explode with a harsh reality that is only worsened by the screams of young soldiers dying and calling for their mothers and splashing fills the air as soldiers jump over the side of boats to escape the bullets. Saving Private Ryan is filled with non-stop audio that overwhelms your hearing. If any Blu-ray is to be a ""show-off"" for your sound system Saving Private Ryan is it!Read the rest here - [...]"
3,Great movie- DVD image quality no so great,We know about the movie itself but the product has a lot of flaws.There are many scenes where the video is grainy washed out or more annoyingly smeared. The same scenes (1st 30 min) that had this poor quality on DVD now show up in greater detail on Blu Ray in 1080p. The Disc was already recalled once and it needs to be again. I was VERY disappointed that these scenes were not fixed.On the plus side the new HD audio track is excellent.
5,To Normandy and back......,"If you like war movies, this movie is for YOU. It's one of the most realistic movie of war, that i've ever seen. The horrors and thrills of war are on your grasp, you can almost feel it. But beware, it's not for the faint of heart. The DVD version comes with superb picture quality as always, it shows that this dvd has really gotten some love in the making. The sound is mixed in DD 5.1 and DD 2.0. The DD 5.1 track makes you're neighbours very nervous, but that's the whole point. You can almost feel the bullets swinging by you, the grenades exploding behind you and so forth. If you don't have this movie yet, consider buying it. CONSIDER REALLY HARD, BECAUSE IT'S WORTH BUYING."
3,You have to see this simply for the amazing DTS soundtrack !,"This is not my favourite genre but if you want to hear a DTS movie soundtrack that simply rules then this is the movie to see. I had to remind myself every now and then that I was only watching a movie and not participating in the action. If you did not enjoy this movie from a story point of view, you must watch it if you want to hear DTS at its best ! Don't forget to turn up that subwoofer though !"
2,"Good action, Muddle point of View","The opening and last scene are great, Tom Hanks is good, but the films pacing is off center, the cinemtography is uneven( colors and visual tones change from scene to scene) The films point of view is never clear, What kind of film was Spielberg making ? A view of war that is strictly combat, a portrait of the soliders ? A political film ? He never onces decides on what he is trying to show so the films becomes increalby uneven by not trying to tell one story but tell many and all are uneven and trite"
2,Humpft,"I sat down and watched this, and honestly, I don't really know what the big deal about it all, was. Sure, it was full of action, the depiction of the atrocities of war was excellent...but...I don't know. It left me with a feeling of emptiness. Not one I would re-see, frankly. Pretty much nothing to the story, really. Just action, bullets, bodies flying about and blood. No big deal"
3,hello? history??,"Seems that Saving Private Ryan has triggered off the assumation by some people that America saved the world during WW2, well actually no it didnt, for gods sake go out and read a history book before you start assuming that america is the saviour of our entire planet. It was part of it but what about everyone else? All the other allies none of which are portrayed in this film, the British, the Canadians, the French not to mention the black and hispanic men all of which fought longer and just as bravely as the Americans but seem to have been forgoten about by Spielburg. Also I think Spielburg lost the plot really about the message he was trying to convey by getting too mixed up in patriotism, action scenes and overlong blatantly oscar begging speeches. Dont get me wrong the Omaha Beach scene was incredible and I think about as close as we will get to realising what those men did for us. This is the only part of the film that is truly horrifying and also the only part worth seeing."
3,"Good, but not Great","I found Saving Private Ryan to be a lot less enjoyable than I hoped it would be. It was, of course, extremely impressive in its scope, remarkable in terms of its humanity and most stunning in visual and audio effects.But the writing and much of the acting was rather poorly done. I really enjoy dialogue and the interaction of characters and while some of the key roles in the movie had interesting things to say, they always managed to say it in a way that made me less interested than I should have been. This prevented me from getting absorbed into the story.It could have been a great movie, but it fell short."
5,waaaaaaaaaaiting for blu-ray,The best war film ... but why ... there is no blu-ray yet ... I have been waiting for years!!!
5,"How can anyone compare this to ""Pearl Harbor""","If some ignorant person can write off any movie with Vin Diesel in it, I certainly get to write off any movie with Ben Affleck. To say that ""Pearl Harbor"" is a better movie is just and insult."
5,"This is a ""Have to see for all!""","This movie says what my grandfather never could. He went to the grave never telling me just what it was like other than ""cold"" or "" we walked a lot"" or some other pleasantry. It was after seeing this movie that it all clicked, what it was that he could never say. Yes, he did survive the D-DAY landing but it lived with him for the rest of his life. I now realize that he never told me about the way it was, I guess, so I would never see him as anything other than a loving grandfather.Spec4 Jack Randolph McClary, I hope rest in peace, you were a good man!"
1,Saving Private Ryan (D-Day 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition),It took very long time to receive the item and when it came it was defective. This item supposed to be new but it seems like the one i got was used and defective do to being used. When i asked for reclacement it was not available. Very dissapointed.
1,Too Sad and Violent,"This movie was to sad and too violent. The plot was OK. I won't reccomend it unless you love war movies. Buy Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me, Wayne's World, Wayne's World 2, or Animal House."
1,wot a load of c?:@:L,this film is slow and has a very thin story line and goes nowere very fast i should have kept the money
2,Big Disappointment,"Anyone who thought this movie was great does not know the historical facts of ""The Invasion"" which was so well done in the movie - ""The Longest Day"". Speilberg did an excellent job with the special effects but failed re how the Germans had prepared for the invasion, the mistakes made and how the Allies planned and carried out the greatest invasion of all. Speilberg, a great director wasted too much time on ""Saving Private Ryan"" at the expense of the actual events. What a lost opportunity for a great diector to re-do ""The Longest Day"" in a manner he is more than well able to do. You have to see The Longest Day to appreciate what I think."
5,Left me shaken and glad to be alive,"I wouldn't say this movie is absolutely perfect but after leaving the theater the first time I saw it, I truly felt fortunate to be among the living. The whole film filled me with an appreciation for the sacrifices those young men made--sacrifices that old black and white footage had never sufficiently brought home to me. The battle scenes are staggering but some of the smaller moments are equally devastating. When Giovanni Rabisi calls out for his mother as he is dying, I felt like I was dying with him. A scene that could have been a cliche instead wiped me out with its emotional power. Everyone should see this movie at least once to fully understand why war is never glorious but many of the people in it can prove themselves to be."
3,Authentic?,"Okay, the whole D-Day scene was great, but as a whole this movie has some knawing little flaws that I just can't get out of my head (and neither can you if you're a history buff like me). I mean, come on, did Spielberg even crack a history book for that final scene? Let's take a little look:i.) The 2nd SS ""Das Reich"" Division did not enter Normandy until June 10th (the movie's climax takes place on the 7th).ii.) ""Das Reich"" had no Tiger tanks, only Panthers and Panzer IV's. To the best of my knowledge, they didn't use Marder SPG's either.iii.) The SS don't use any light machine guns. In reality, each infantry squad had 2-3 MG-34's or MG-42's. The whole German infantry stratagy was based around the machine gun.iv.) Do you actually think the SS would just walk blindly into a town without checking for booby traps, enemy numbers etc, etc. Infantry goes in first (very cautiously), then armor. Did they learn nothing from 5 years of constant fighting?"
5,Simply Magnificent!,I was blown away by the opening seen of this moving. Never have I experienced such realism in a movie. Tom Hanks was superb as usual and shows his wide range of acting ability. Steven Spielberg has another classis that will go down as one of the greatest movies ever made. This is a must see for all generations!
5,An All-Time Great,"Truly one of the best movies of all time;certainly the best movie in the War Genre. The crime is that this was not the Academy Award Best Picture of the Year. Instead that year the award went to Shakespeare in Love; an easily forgotten movie that doesn't stand up to qaulity of Saving Private Ryan. Perhaps a too Liberal Hollywood couldn't bring itself to vote for a War movie. A true shame, since it is perhaps the most accurate depiction of the horror of war."
5,the best ever,this was by far the best ever war movie i ever seen i recomend if you have never seen it GET IT it will change how you feel about all war vets and it shows just how much there friends ment to them and the lenghts they went to save or protect them
4,Great Sound,"If you've seen/heard the movie in Dolby Digital 5.1, you should give DTS a try. Having copies of both, the DTS sound is much more crisp and lifelike. It is incredible."
4,True Fiction,"The story line is good, the action is realistic -- the D-Day scene will awe you with respect for those who actually faced those bloody beaches. What a generation, the greatest generation who really saved a great deal of the world from absolute tyrany. No doubt about it. We owe them our respect, movies like this resound with that truth."
5,Hail to the Chief!,"There is now doubt about it, this is not only one of Director Steven Speilberg's finest film epics, but it is also the best war film to date. The details of WWII aren't sugar-coated and Speilberg doesn't spend precious time trying to beat around the bush... THIS IS WAR! It smells like war, tastes like war, feels like war, and anyone who has particapated in a war can blatantly testify to this. War is hell, and this is probably the closest many viewers will get to either. Though this film went out of its way to present its chracters as real, normal folks like you and me (not the gold plated figures of John Wayne films), in the end the people of this film did come out of it as heroes. This is what they were, and a one man raid wasn't neeeded to tell us that. This film is as good as or equal to ""Schindler's List,"" WATCH IT!"
2,FULL METAL JACKET!,"Whoever said you need to rent Full Metal Jacket is right. Private Ryan was great technically, great cinematography, but the plot w/ tom hanks and matt damon was a joke! Don't get me wrong, they're great actors- but you just can't stick them in a movie like this! Please, just get Kubrick's Full metal Jacket- and while you're at it, get the Stanley Kubrick Collection! And if you want a great commentary- check out Brazil!"
4,GREAT SOUND EFFECTS,The opening sound effects at the beach when water splash was incredible! I wish moviemakers put more sound effects like this in movies. I've watched this one in DTS format and needless to say I'm thrilled! Landing on the beach scene is far too realistic and incredible! Overall story is not bad!
5,Most Realistic WWII Film Ever,"Spielberg has done it again. Sound familiar. Yes, but this film, Private Ryan is one of his best he has made. The film opens with the bloody DDAY battle that left me with my mind boggled and my mouth open. The sounds and visions of the battle are so realistic you think you are there fighting alongside the soldiers. It made feel glad to be an American after the scene. To finish things off, you must see this film if you haven't already. I can't believe Tom Hanks didn't win Best Actor for his role as Captain Miller."
5,Ture,This movie captures so many of the horrors of waar. I was in the Navy in World WarII and I waas one of the first people on Omaha(Sorry I can't spell very good) And it was like seeing it all over agian.
3,"A Well-done,okey war movie","It was an okey movie and it was kinda boring, But the war scenes just blew me away, It sooner or later became a little more intresting, but no awards for this movie."
5,One of my top favorite WW II movies,"Impressive. All 5/5 stars for the first 15-20 minutes of the movie and the whole story of course is magnificent. Awesome! This is my favorite WW II movie. Great job and a fitting tribute to those who died trying to liberate Europe from Nazism and Fascism. Extremely well-done and a great movie. Makes me tear eyed when the army car comes by to notify Ryan's family of their sons' death. The acting is great and the visual effects are very well-done. Moreover, the Robert Kapa's style of photography is amazing. Spielberg might be a typical liberal Hollywood star but his movies are fantastic. He's got better yr by yr. I think this is thus far the best WW 2 movie of the recent yrs. loved it!"
5,WW2 truth,"I'm a twelve year old girl, and I just loved this movie. I've always been facinated by WW2 and this movie tells and shows the truth. It's very realistic, and graphic. Children under ten should definetly not see it(because of the graphics). If you faint or get quesey at the sight of blood I advise you not to watch it."
3,Doesn't hold up on repeat viewings,"I saw this movie three times, twice on the big screen -- where it should be seen -- and once on video. After the first viewing, I could barely sit through it again. There were too many plot and dramatic holes. For example, Miller's hand-trembling problem seemed a cheap dramatic gimmick, and it was never resolved. Second, inexplicably, way too many guys dropped down and sobbed like babies. Third, can you imagine how much ham-fisted, pseudo-philosophical dialogue is given to guys debating the reasons for the special treatment accorded to Ryan? Spielberg's technical expertise is squandered on severely mediocre material. This is screenwriting at its most incompetent. And goodness, there's even a stereotype from Brooklyn, Noo Yawk."
4,"Good, but flawed movie","I thought this was a terrific movie about people caught up in a war until about 2/3 of the way through when it switched to just another Hollywood war movie. It was so good up to that point. I still give it 4 stars, but I feel that the movie was unduly cheapend by most of the scenes near the end.This movie has many very good, rich scenes... Probably the most highly vaunted is the initial scene of the beach landing... yet there were several scenes that I found more powerful and more substantive.However, ultimately this movie is reduced to the normal action flick formula wherein the enemy is personified in an individual and revenge is the ultimate vindicator. Too bad."
3,"Great Movie, Awful DVD Picture","The movie was great, but what is up with the quality! That was horrible, so many scenes were washed out and there was a skip at one point, also. I returned my original copy to Amazon and got a new one, but the new one is just as bad. What was Dreamworks doing when they released this. I was wondering have other people had this problem our is it my player."
2,Great work of historical fiction!,"I've seen this movie twice. hats of to the costumers and technical adviseors. The uniforms and equipment were wonderfully accurate. However I watched this the first time with a veteran that was part of the first wave (green sector, dog beach). First he stated that the beach landing wasn't as bloody as it showed. All the fortifications were blown away. The Army didn't get tanks on shore till the fourth wave. And there was no artillery present. The only Germans there were infantry, and machine gunners. Before it was over he was critiziing every action that was shown. The way prisoners were taken, and especially the guy who was going AWOL. Watch this film for the equipment and uniforms. Also the filthiness of the soldiers was great. All in all I'll take The Longest Day, or The Desert Fox over this film any time. There are many articles out on the true story of Private Ryan, read them. The articles are history, but would have made a very dull movie."
2,qgraphic violence on the premise to justify authenticity,most of us humans understand that war is and always has been terrible for lack of many more suitable words.I am not quite sure the motive behind this movie whether to succomb us to such graphic violence or to show us that war is a game with no holds bar at any stake. Ironically we are still missing some very real trajedies of which if this to be an accurate war picture it has missed. Not to my displeasure. I give this movie two stars
2,So/So at best.....,"My biggest problem is that you didn't know the charecters. The only one that I felt sad about was the medic. I went threw the movie thinking, ""SO?"" Steven made it so NOT emotional and very disconnected that I lost interest in the movie fast. By the 2 hour mark I was just BEGGING for the end to be what it was because Hanks was like a robot in the movie and I started to hate the character for that reason.Steven needs to put some more human emotion in his movies again. Like some people that I have talked to at the video company I work Steven needs to get of the pulplt for awhile because ,like Hanks before ""You've Got Mail"", he is losing his edge on why I loved his art."
2,SPIELBERG BETRAYS THE FANS!,"This movie won its awards almost entirely on the strength of its incredibly visualized battle scenes. Then what does Spielberg do? A VHS-only release.This movie's greatness comes from the award-winning sound and sights, but rather than put the enhanced audio and video capabilities of the DVD format to use, he'd rather stick it in 240 lines of resolution and analog sound.Unless you missed this in theaters and just can't wait to see what all the talk was about, don't even rent this tape. Wait for the DVD release."
2,Don't Bother,"That was too bad that this film didn't win the best picture (because that means the biggest embarrassment of the world, and now the biggest embarrassment went to Shakespeare in Love, that was brilliant for that one). If Mr. Spielberg (have some forgiveness if I spell his name wrong, but I don't really care) thought that shocked the audience with violent graphics was more important than focus on a character who was talking (he focused on nothing when someine was talking!?), then he may probably win an award if he produced a motion picture that shows how Japenese treated Chinese, Korean, and Southern Asian (I know that he'd not be interested). Anyway, for the bad directing and screenwriting, I refuse to make any good comment onthat film, excepting that cast."
2,War is horrible? Who woulda thunk it?,"I was so glad this didn't win best picture. The stunning open sequence is designed to distract you from a meandering plot, poor charcterizations, and unconvincing dialogue. This film is not a revelatory masterpiece: American Depravity in World War two has been discussed as far back to 1953 in the vastly superior ""From Here to Eternity."" As I am working on a world war two project, I resent the fact thatI will be accused of being inspired by this over-rated spectacle."
5,THIS MOVIE ROCKSSSSSSSS,"This movie is one of Spielberg's best WW2 movies. It's graphic and really shows you how the war was fought. I'm a HUGE fan of the WW's, and I have to say this movie is one of the best."
5,THANK YOU,"""Saving Private Ryan"" was gold, Steven Spielberg's best work ever. Anybody who walks away from this 1998 account of America saving the world on D-Day, without a glowing respect for what we sacrificed, is an idiot or a ""useful idiot.""STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF ""BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN""STWRITES@AOL.COM"
1,stupid movie,"the film realistic view of battle means very little with such an unrealistic view of soliders and a story that is lack in quailty and meaning. THe film is hardly compelling, th vilonce is empty, the charaters are card board, the acting by all except davis is espaclly weak and embarssing. Hanks show little talent as an actor he is atricous. The film is boring and emoty with little meaning and no power to it."
1,If you like cardboard cut-outs watch this.,"Take away the battle scene and what have you got? The second worst, most boring movie ever,other than A.I. Followed only then by the rest of the Spielberg catalogue. If you want to be patronized by a guy who has time and time again turned out simplistic non-sensical films about some of the most interesting subjects then join the other cows in the field."
1,pure american crap,"This is Steven Spielberg at his most childish. He doesn't know anything about what it was like to be an American in WWII.It was loud and stupid. I'm an American and proud that we fought in that war, but also greatly saddened by the loss of american lives in the war. But I'm not proud that Spielberg is an American. An American flag at the beginning and an American flag at the end is the dumbest form of patriotism I have ever seen."
5,Trancends all WW2 films ever made,"Saving Private Ryan shows us a new perspective of war but in fact it is an old perspective, and that's realism. Many of the shots may make people cringe no matter how desensitized they are towards violence. I think all Americans should see this film. Many of us have heard our grandpas stories of WW2, now we actually see the stories in reality."
3,'Saving Pvt. Ryan' Needs Saved,"If you avoid all the pr and hype about Spielberg and this movie, and simply watch the film it really boils down to a not-very-believable plot line with a film that doesn't make you care one iota about any single character. And, frankly, better war movies have been made, particularly 'The Big Red One.' Nothing new, nothing spectacular here, sorry Spielberg fans."
1,Very slow and one dimensional film,"This was a distinctly average, badly paced, drawn out film. The only redeeming feature is Kaminski's cinematography, but Speilberg even made that 1.78:1 instead of the 2.35:1 that a film like this needs.Check out 'The Thin Red Line' instead to see the same subject matter handled much better. This is nothing more than a few one dimensional characters wrapped around 2 set pieces at the beginning and end."
1,Saving nobody,"This movie is definitely a disappointment.The plot is rediculous from the start. Would any army waste the lives of 8 men to save a nobody?Even if they would, Private Ryan didn't get saved. He wasn't in great peril or a Prisoner of War. The whole movie doesn't make sense.The storyline is too linear. Good effects and realistic portrayal of war details should not compromise on a good storyline.All I can say after watching this is: DON'T BUY IT."
1,"Over-hyped, distorted flub.","This gory, pseudo patriotic movie is just not that good. Behind the emotionalism is the real danger of blind faith in anything. The acting is not that great(average at best) and the only real exceptional factor of the film is the special effects, which serve only to make it for a more unpleasant experience. For a group of of numbered green soldiers to take on a tank column without proper weaponery is not only stupid on their part, but very unrealitstic. Anybody would have run. The real attraction for people seems to be the ""greatest generation"" myth which has popped up recently. This view that the folks living during that time were somehow superior morally or otherwise(remember this is the same generation that tolerated segregation and Japanese internment) gives us a flawed view of history. These people just did the things they did because they had to. This is a concept that the new generation of white Hollywood billionaires who produced SPR could never fully understand."
1,Hooray for Hollywood!,Thank god for 'Saving Private Ryan' with authentic representation of WW2. At school I was told that the British had something to do with the War - our young minds were brainwashed! God bless America!
3,It has it's peaks...,"""Saving Private Ryan"" was a pretty good movie. It really stressed how horrible war is and how scared soldiers were, but between the disturbing action scenes, there seemed to be hours of endless and boring chitter-chatter. But I give it credit for the action scenes which were very well thought out. The best part is the beginning. But just so you know..this IS NOT a bad movie..but it may bore some people."
3,Overrated,Anyone who seriously believes Saving Private Ryan is the best war movie ever made needs to rent Full Metal Jacket.
5,This is the best movie I have ever seen.,Saving Private Ryan is the best movie that i have ever seen. It tells the story of the allied invasion of France in World War II. It depicts what the war was really like. It makes me very thankful for our armed forces who were willing to give up their lives for our safety and the safety of others.
1,GREAT FOR ALL YOU SUB-MORONS OUT THERE....,"As has been mentioned countless times, yes, the picture quality and color are wonderful in this movie. That is about it. Although Spielberg does an excellent job of replicating a wartime scenario, he does not utilize it as a vehicle to promote understanding an any way. By endeavoring to create a ""War"" move, whatever that means, it is the director's responsibility to treat it with care and maturity. With the inconsistent directing style and wooden performances of the actors, the only thing that seems to be spent on this movie is a lot of money (as upposed to time and thought.) If you wish for a better understanding of human nature and intellectualism in the Wartime setting, try Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red Line, or perhaps the first half of Full Metal Jacket, made by directors that know what they are doing."
3,torn,"Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I would like to give the item Five stars but cannot and this is why. It seems whenever they make a movie with older technology than what we have today, and they try to remake it in HD, it looks like crap. My regular DVD version of this movie looks way better. The movie in blu ray took a bit to LOAD. Yes, it had to load. I never had to wait on any other blu ray to LOAD. The movie was also, unfortunately grainy and in some scenes reminded me of those old,old movies where you can see the lines and spots from the petroleum made film negatives. I think that maybe the only thing that was improved was the sound quality."
1,Serious subject matter doesn't automatically make movie good,"I watched this movie some time ago. Thinking about it now, I realized that while a lot happened on screen, I don't remember most of it. Why? Because the film's action was mindless.There is nothing wrong with realism or grit. But there is something wrong with realism or grit if it isn't advancing the story's ideas further, if it isn't moving the characters or the viewers along. As it stands, what I had in my mind at the beginning of the movie was exactly what was there at the end. I came in, like most, with knowledge of the horror of WWII, and all the movie did was affirm this knowledge. I didn't learn anything from this movie; there was nothing in it that made me think and reach new conclusions. After watching it, I knew nothing more of men's motives, or soldiers' lives, or the impact of conflicts on psychology, or history, or contemporary politics, or ANYTHING. I can forget it entirely, and be none the worse off."
3,Oh my god!!!!!!,"dude its a good film an all the sounds amazin, blah blah blah but the thing that really bugged me was its just the Americans involved and all the americans just completely ignore the fact that there were other countries in world war 2 as well!! They are all like well it started in 1941 but it didnt!! the real war started in 1939 when Britain protected Poland. I hate it when all the americans try to act all heroic but in fact England played a much bigger part and so did Russia."
1,NOT A REALISTIC LOOK AT WW II...,"It seems to me that to many people forgot that a significant number of african-american men died defending this country in WW II also. Trying to give this movie the benefit of the doubt, I saw the movie twice. Coming to the sad realization that there wasn't one, not one african-american face in this movie. Not dead, alive or wounded. This cannot be an accident. Why is it so hard to give credit where credit is due. The year 2000 is here, and this kind of thing shouldn't still be happening....The only reason I didn't rate this movie a zero is because of Barry Pepper's portral of Pvt. Jackson. I've seen him in other film, and He's a very good and likable actor. I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work. E. McKee"
3,"A COMPARISON BETWEEN ""RYAN"" & ""THE THIN RED LINE""","The Thin Red Line(TTRL):The opening scene is a soldier living and playing peacefully with native pacific islanders.Saving Private Ryan(SPR): The opening scene is a huge American flag.TTRL:The Japanese are humans like everybody else.SPR: The Germans are ugly, filthy and evil.TTRL: Sean Penn, Nick Nolte and Woody Harrelson excel in their performances without needing to compete with each other.SPR: Tom Hanks' ""good kid"" face doesn't fade from the screen for the entire movie.TTRL: American soldiers can be cruel.SPR: American soldiers can be cruel, but deep down they're good fellas.TTRL: ""This war is about property"" (Sean Penn)SPR: ""Tell me I've led a good life"" (an old-timer who was Matt Damon)"
1,No DTS Track!!!!,"This is capitalism at it's finest. There is no DTS track on this version of the film, why not???!!! Because the studio is making you buy the entire 4-dvd World War II Collection, in order to get an ""exclusive DTS 5.1"" track. What a crock. I'm stickin with my older DTS version and I suggest fellow DTS version owners do the same."
1,Thanks for double-dipping...,"I'm so sick of studios releasing multiple dvds of the same film. I bought the first edition of SPR when it came out. Instead of taking the time to do it right back then, you wait until now to try to leach more money out of fans of the film. Guess what, I'm not buying it. I will rent it to check out the special features, but you won't get my money twice. It may be good business for you Dreamworks, but it isn't good public relations."
2,An ok action film,"This was a pretty fun action movie, but not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spielberg has done much better. Plus it was a bit too anti-German for my tastes. Some nice slam-bang action scenes, but overall not the roller coaster ride I was expecting."
2,Well made but thats about it,"This film is far far overrated. The opening 1/2 an hour is indeed shocking and the last 1/2 hour is action packed but the film is held together by a rediculous and self indulgent plot that only the Speilberg could put out as a serious film. This film is so patriotic its sickening, this film doesnt say anything even though it pretends to. If youwant to see a truely deep, meaningful and beautiful war movie, then check out The Thin Red Line that came out the same year. Avoid this sentimental speech filled insulting piece of crap."
2,Sorry Steve & Tom,"For realiality, I give it a 5 star, watchablility a two star. Had to fast forward through much of the beginning of the movie, for it was too stressful for me and I can imagine how it must have been for those who had gone through the experience in person. The beginning would have been accepted better later in the movie as a flash back. Couldn't finish the movie, for was just too ""REAL"". I can accept that but made me so stressed there were people who had to go through the experience in real life. My heart goes out to them and their families."
3,Grabs you by the neck. . .and then. . .lets go. . .,"The opening sequence in this film grips the viewer like a soldier grips a yet-to-be-thrown grenade. It takes your breath away and make non-veterans think, ""Is war REALLY like that?"" The performances are solid with Tom Sizemore--not Hanks--possibly turning in the best of all. (Don't think that Hanks wasn't good though. He was as always.) The only problem with this movie is its surprisingly thin plot. About halfway through the film, it slows to the point of allowing the viewer to finally realize that this movie is quite long. With a careful shaving of unneeded scenes, this could've been a much better film. The power that bolts off the screens at the bookends of the film is definitely worth the time though."
2,Half-baked,Once again Spielberg wastes great photography and special effects by stacking them on a film with an absolutely dismal script. The level of cheap sentimentality and jingoism in this film could gag a maggot.
5,Saving Private Ryan powerful winner,"Opening 20 minutes of harrowing combat so real it's upsetting. Very realistic, and entertaining"
4,Transfer was a disappointment.,"I am surprised that this DVD passed final quality control. There are 2 specific instances where the transfer was flawed, extended freeze frames. The DTS sound was excellent; but the interface was not fully functional. When you select DTS, it re-shows the leader w/o sound."
5,This was the greatest war movie of all time!,"Saving Private Ryan gives people like us the experiences faced by WWII veterns. Most of us have never even seen the fog of war, but this movie is great at bringing it home. Who cares what flaws are in this movie. It is realistic, stunning, and a good lesson to future wars. American World War II veterns are the real heroes who are often overlooked. Congress should be forced to watch this movie before they send us off to die in Yugoslavia."
3,Over-rated,"I will give Private Ryan great credit for its incredible action sequences. They alone justify most acclaim for the film, and justify owning it. However, the film is terribly uneven, and I am geniunely surprised that more people have not picked up on it. The dialogue ranges from adequate to horrible. Every character is stereotyped and one-dimensional. The domestic sequences are laughable. And, the bookend scenes with the elder Matt Damon are so hokey and contrived that they come thisclose to ruining the entire cinematic experience. With Schindler's List, Spielberg managed to capture the whole of human experience without seeming forced, as he often does here. Saving Private Ryan can be fascinating and horrifying, but it also one big boulder away from being the fourth Indiana Jones film."
2,Great battle sequences. Would have been great IMAX film.,"Great visuals, lame plot. Typical Speilbergian effort. As usual, the movie feels impersonal, as though Steve thought he was going to make a grand statement about war. What is it? War is hell? War is good if it saves a Private Ryan at the expense of a lot of others on a worthless mission? Gore looks cool? Who the heck knows? The opening sequence is great for displaying the chaos of battle, but a great technical effort doesn't exactly make for an emotionally involving scene. The ending is absolutely horrible and makes a mockery of those who died in WWII. Was Private Ryan worth it? Yes for battle scenes. As a movie, it was only average."
4,Saving Private Ryan,"I avoided this movie for quite awhile before I finally relented and watched it. I figured that it being a Hollywood blockbuster type movie starring Tom Hanks and all, that I would be in for another flag-waving, quasi-propagandistic American take on World War Two. Well, that's not quite the case. I actually found the combat depicted to be closer to what it must have been like than you find in most war movies. The story was also deeper than I expected, although at times it seemed a little contrived. So overall, yeah, I though that it wasn't all that bad."
4,Fitting Memorial for the Finest Generation,"I wanted this movie in my personal collection - after seeing it twice in the theaters several years ago. I'm not a great movie buff, but this was special. I'm also a military history buff, and have studied Normandy and D-Day extensively.My father is a WWII Vet/Infantry Officer. He didn't land at Normandy, but was in two amphibious landings in Europe - Anzio Italy and Southern France. He never talked about them much - even after he presented me with my commission many years ago. After reading eyewitness accounts and seeing the opening scenes, I can understand why he didn't want to talk.I think the other appeal of this movie is the way Speilberg crafts the interpersonal relationships among the men - especially the newby interpreter Allman who at heart is a coward and demonstrates it at the end of the movie by shooting the prisoner as compensation for his own inability to do his duty earlier, when it mattered."
3,Typical Spielberg,"An incredibly ambitious film that gets weighed down in syrup and shmaltz, which is typical Spielberg. He can't seem to let the audience think for themselves too much...instead he has to hammer home his point and ""make"" us feel a certain way. This over-the-top emotional manipulation almost ruins this film...but fortunately he and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski shot some of the most spectacular and memorable war footage ever seen on film. A good overall WWII film with some amazing images hampered by some heavy-handed story and dialogue."
5,The greatest movie ever made,When I first went to the theater to see this great movie. I was extremely touched by the experiences I had seen on screen. I definatly reccomend this to anyone who loves movies.
5,One of the best war movies i've ever seen,This movie is highly realistic!!!The film tells you how bad world war 2 was.People go to war because they think they could be heroes and make their country proud.Well people don't have to go to war and it is very dangerous!!!they think they could be heroes and make their country proud.Well people don't have to go to war and it is very dangerous!!!The film is remarkable and once your in D-Day preparing to land on Omaha Beach everything is going to get worse.You can see how much blood and gore is in this with one of the soldier's exposed guts and the enemy doesn't give you a chance to live.This film may not be right for queasiest and the film is one of the best.WW2 fans are going to like this and be relieved you didn't have to go to World War 2.Ignore the ones who gave it a negative review and said it was overrated.If you have something bad to say about it don't bother posting a one star review.
5,D-Day 1944,"A great war story on the invasion of Normandy in June of 1944. Although a fictional story, it is a composite of true stories."
3,Movie was excellent,"Offer full screen as well as widescreen, I refuse to purchase any widescreen DVD's. Give the public a choice."
2,Ho hum,"This isn't a movie about war. This is a special effects demo.It's too bad. Spielberg is a gifted technician, but not a great moviemaker. When watching a Spielberg movie, I never get the sense that Spielberg is laying his life on the line. His movies don't touch me. Ryan is no exception.I hope that one day Spielberg will start making movies that move me. Until then, I can only enjoy the magic of his technique."
3,bloated and saggy but with great battle scenes,"The troops were shipped to the shore by the british navy but in the film they are americans, spielberg again trying to somehow rewrite history, the war was won by america, nothing to do with the russians or english, right? In the only mention of the british involvement we get a wig wearing Sam from Cheers telling us how overrated Monty is. The scene where the captain is spouting abraham lincoln comes across as crass and artificial, thousands of soldiers have just died and the entire chief of staff takes a break to discuss the death of one soldier. Then we get a dewy eyed glimpse of farmland america complete with white picket fences and billowing corn fields. A pity as lot of this film is truly inspiring: the start and end battles, the death of the medic, the german soldiers pleas for mercy. Best war film? I still rate Platoon for that."
5,"If you don't cry, your made of stone. The best film ever.","I know that I made an ""a priori"" statement in the summary of my review, but I believe it. I was in the military years ago but never had to face a war, thank God. This film kicked me in the gut and let me experience (as much as a film can) the horror of what these brave men had to go through. The performances and the directing and producing are first rate. This movie should have won an Oscar for every catagory that it was nominated for. Please, seek out a veteran and give him (or her) a hearty ""Thank you"" for doing what many of our current polititians refused to do. They risked their lives and their liberty to preserve ours. I will make one caveat: if you have a tender heart, please don't see this movie."
4,WIDESCREEN RATIO,"I greatly admired this movieHowever, the widescreen version does not use the widescreen ratio used in theatres and is thereby somewhat lacking. This is true of the DVD too. I am subtracting a star for this."
5,Requires patience... which pays to its last ounce.,"The horror scenes of people being shot to death or severed of certain limbs are indeed cruel and even disgusting at times, but it's not the disgust that these scenes visualize, but the horrors of war. These scene are there to make you understand what the American WW2 soldiers went through to defend and protect nations outside the US. The horrors are indeed hard to take in, but as soon as these are over, new horrors lurk in the next scenes. Emotional horrors. The tension of getting yourself killed at any time.It's not about horror, it's far from it... it's about a family with no father that 3 out of 4 sons were killed in the war, and the youngest is to be saved by a group of unique and wonderful soldiers. It's a beautiful story, beautifully told. I loved that movie, seen it 5 times already and nuking some more popcorn to see it again. :) Highly recommended."
5,One Heck of a movie!,"This is definitely one of the most outstanding movies of our times. Besides the subject matter, actors, photography, direction and scope, this movie is well worth the watch and cost for the Blu-Ray copy. The clarity and the reality of was is right in your face! You really feel as if you are one of the guys carrying the pack next to your buddy. I bought it and had a group of friends over to watch it. Within two weeks each of them bought the movie for themselves as they felt it was a classic everyone should have on their shelves. Thanks Amazon for making it priced for us all in Blu-Ray!"
4,A stellar release of an arguable war movie masterpiece,"This review is of the Sapphire Series Blu-Ray release of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.I will refrain from reviewing the material here as either you would already have an opinion on this one, or if not you should see this before the rather expensive BD purchase to develope your own (unless you just have lots of money like that, of course.)I will say that the transfer is immaculate, do NOT expect a better release on this generation of technology.And for the record, Spielberg and Williams have my tear-ducts twitching with the opening Arlington sequence even before the first line of dialogue is ever spoken. To me this is a film classic."
1,dvd,In very bad shape would not play at all tryed both of my dvds and nothing but wont work in this area? Ever heard of that?
4,great quality,Great quality for a movie filmed in 1998 with standard def cameras in case your wondering the saphire sereis blurayis a Paramount thing they take there time taking older norm def movies making them up to bluray quality...as much as u can that is...but it takesalota work and time to do this that most dont take the time to do so this is def the best quality u will see thismovie in and of course we all know its a great movie one of the best for the price and quality u cant beat it pick it up today!
4,A Must See!,"The movie does an excellent job on showing the horrors of D-Day and other events within World War II. However, the plot of the movie which is the search for Private Ryan, is a bit cheesy but makes the movie less boring. Overall I give it 4 stars."
5,Wonderfully Touching,One of the most touching movies I've ever seen. It really brings home what others went through so we can enjoy freedom. I really love the added info on the DVD. I rented this then realized I had to own it.
5,A perfect impression,"Last summer I visited Omaha Beach / Normandie. Walking on the beaches and between 10.000 graves, you wonder how it realy was those days.Spielberg and his cast gave me a perfect impression. The movie is a great illustration for the museums I visited in Aromanges (Normandie).The people who visited Normandie know that europe will never forget the price of freedom. Thanks to the movie, the whole world knows the price of freedom.This is no entertainment, it's history, a lesson."
2,I can't watch chapter 12,I really like the movie but I can't watch my DTS version of the movie. Chapter 12 video and sound breaks up and the picture freezes. I just received my second DTS DVD from Amazon and same thing happens. Has this happened to anybody?
3,The sound effect on DVD is not as good as that on VHS.,I rented a VHS version of the movie from Rogers Video and I liked the movie. So I went to Future Shop and bought a DVD version of the movie. I was very disappointed because the sound effect on the DVD is much worse than that on the VHS I rented. From now on I will not believe that DVD is better than VHS. I think it all depends on who made the dvd/tape.
5,DTS ROCKS!,"I own hundreds of DVD movies and this is the one that every die hard ""DVD buff"" should own. The movie itself is awesome but I am talking about the incredible DTS soundtrack! The most realistic gunfire and explosion sound effects I have ever heard on a war film. No other movie that I have in my collection can reproduce that much sonic power. There is clearly a difference between Dolby Digital and DTS. I just hope that DTS releases the Matrix and Armageddon in this format. Kudos to Amazon.com for carrying a large selection of DTS DVDs for those who are serious about digital surround sound."
5,Saving Private Elmo,I agree with the viewer from Minnesota. The combat scenes involving Kermit and Miss Piggy were much too intense. That scene with Gonzo and the German officer engaged in hand-to-hand combat caused my 4 year-old to cry. Definitely not a movie for playtime.
2,Near perfect cinematography but not much else.,"Perhaps the best shot war film. Perfect use of colors, ie its emphasis in dark and red hues. The slow shutter speed used in this film also brings incredible realism to this movie. Also pretty accurate special effects. Other than than that the movie has a marginal, at best, script and plot. The acting is so-so and the chracters are completely forgetable. But in all fairness I really don't think the point of this movie was to involve the viewer in plot per se, but rather to let the viewer experience, quite accurately, one of the most historic and gruesome day in world history."
5,"Shocking, Staggering, Overwhelming, Realistic....","Obviously the best war film ever made, and more specifically the best film about the Normandy Invasion. The footage is as realistic as the war itself, and Steven Spielberg clearly shows us just HOW a human being would react if put under such heavy psychological and emotional pressure."
3,AGEAN STABLES ....,"Immensely powerful, melancholy and fit for one viewing [repeated viewings just dull the senses and remove the impact]. Tremendous tech credits - especially the sound design and the editing of the first 20 minutes ......Storyline? ""Bring Him Back Alive"" - standard fare for the adventurer, but just one of so many deeds - unspoken - during WW11.Better fare? Care Foreman's ""THE VICTORS"" [WW2 - from all sides] also Claude Le Louche ""Marriage"" [1974], ""The Bridge"", and even ""The Longest Day"" ~ but not forgetting the indelible ""The Young Lions""."
3,WWII is heroic theme itself...,"You don't have to invent absolutly unbelievable story to make a film about WWII. It was horrible and heroic time by itself. So, as one of previous reviewer said: ""1 star for the opening sequence, 1 star for the perfomance"". I'd like to notice that if IT IS a real story, then it's a story about a general who is able to WASTE some of his soldiers to look ""good soul""... Sorry guys, but it is my impression.I put the 3rd star, because only after this movie I understood something about Western front. You know, in the school (long ago) we were just told that Americans entered the war in the end of WWII. In my justification I can say that some Americans believe Germany and Russia were allies (apparently they think 27,000,000 Soviet people were killed by Americans)! Your schools were not much better..."
3,Why not DVD?,"I thought this movie was fine, it had nice battle scenes and all, but its bigest problens are: The middle was boring. Very boring. and why isnt it on DVD? the movie would be better on DVD, it's so long that the chapter selection feature would be helpfull."
5,'Earn this',"I will never forgive the academy for choosing 'Shakespeare in Love' over 'Saving Private Ryan' for best picture. As often happens, I loaned an older version of this movie to a friend, forgot, and bought another copy, because this film had to be in the collection. My disclaimer here is that I was never a combat soldier or a soldier in the US army. So please consider their opinion ahead of mine. This is no glamour war film, it's gritty, violent, uplifting, disgusting, heroic, and emotionally draining. This is a must see epic."
5,Spielberg's Most Ambitious Directing,"I have seen Saving Private Ryan 6 or 7 times and I never fail to be amazed at the technical wizardry that is the Normandy Beach scene. There has probably never been a great moment in history so closely realized for those of us fortunate enough not to be there. I see many people on here with one-star reviews, some taking Speilberg to task for exploiting D-Day, somehow, by showing what happened. Listen to the veterans, folks, before it's too late to hear their voices...they say this is exactly how it was.I don't believe there could ever be another event like the second World War, and I don't believe there has ever been a more faithful attempt to capture it. Yes, the surrounding story is sometimes hokey, but the four set pieces (D-Day, the Sniper and the French Villagers, the Machine-Gun Nest at the Radar Station, and the Last Stand at the Bridge) are magnificent. A truly historic film, in both senses of the word."
5,Its an Incredible and Vey well made Movie,"Saving Private Ryan is the movie that everyone have to see, its true that the movie has the more realistic violence see in a movie, but is true too that movie is Very well acted adn has the most intense Sound, The sound is incredible and the image is perfect, I loved this movie, and I think this movie dont want to show you that war is good, all the opossite want to show how bad it could be. Buy it You never can buy a treaure Like This."
5,Awesome and Horrifying,"This movie blew me away. I was one of those kids who liked to ""play war"" and fantasize about being a heroic soldier. When I saw this film, it made me realize that war is a horrible thing.A beautiful and stunning tribute to the heroes of WWII, ""Saving Private Ryan"" will affect you deeply. Its real strength is introducing characters that you really care about and identify with. So many other war movies, even good ones like ""Platoon"" have cliched characters and stereotyped solders. This film puts YOU in the shoes of the fighting men- and that is the most frightening and effective part of all. I remember leaving the theater after seeing it for the first time thinking ""how did they do it? "" I found it amazing that these men had the courage to do what they did.Tom Hanks is at his usual best as the main character, and Matt Damon shines as well. The sound and visual impact are unequaled. This is an experience you will never forget..."
5,The Best,The visuals alone are worth the time for this movie and the added features to the DVD are excellent. In sum: Buy this movie - you'll be glad.
5,Doesn't try to glorify War,"The acting and directing perfectly portrays the gruesomeness of war. There are many different struggles displayed throughout the film. I for one do not normally like war time movies because I feel Hollywood is just glorifying the hard fought sacrifices men and women had to make in the battles.Saving Private Ryan doesn't hide anything or make war look ""good"" in any light."
1,Faulty Disc,"The disc stops playing halfway through. We tried it numerous times to make sure, but it stopped in the same spot every time. The quality of the disc was listed as 'Very Good', but clearly does not live up to that quality."
3,Looks like a regular DVD!!,"In short, the movie is great (it always has been), and there are plenty of extras to keep one entertained for quite some time. But the quality of the ""Blu-Ray"" edition is underwhelming: it looked very much like a better-than average DVD, not Blu-Ray. I was expecting the sharp, crisp lines that I have come to expect from a Blu-Ray product. Alas, I was disappointed with this iteration of Saving Private Ryan for this reason alone. Since I am unaware of whether or not there will be future updates to this picture, I was forced to award it only 3 stars."
2,Not worthy of the praise heaped upon it....,"Honestly, the only reason to see this film is the cinematography; it is one gigantic plot hole as it's told through the ""memories"" of ""Private Ryan"" who wasn't present through most of the action of the film. The characters are thinly developed stock war characters that we never really get to know (with the exception of Tom Hanks' character since he is an uberstar). I can't express my disappointment with this film after the critical praise heaped upon it. I'd recommend ""Thin Red Line"" over this any day! Just my opinion..."
3,best fantasy film ever,"This was an impressing film, esp. the first 20 minutes. But when one sees the rest of it: it becomes more and more strange. Is this how americans love to re-invent history?! Thanks to the comment of Sven Oliver Roth below... Although I am afraid that a historical point of view is not very populair for the american majority reading these comments."
3,VHS lessens the experience!,"As a multiple viewer of Saving Private Ryan in the theater, I was disappointed with the loss of true digital sound and picture quality presented on the video tape. A great film like this becomes nothing more than a good film when these features are lessened. As everyone knows, this film was known for its special effects and realistic audio - VHS does not have the capability to bring them to us. If you haven't seen the film yet, wait for the DVD (if it ever comes out) and watch Saving Private Ryan the way it was meant to be watched!!"
3,The War Department couldn't have made a better film,"From a totally aesthetic perspective, the film's principle storyline is fatally flawed. The effect is a jumbled film, a mishmash of melodramatic images and mindless special effects. A 'Jaws' for war. There is no heart to Saving Private Ryan. It's a heartless, mind-numbing, flag-waving extravaganza. The final image is, in fact, a waving American flag. Here's to war, to the flag, and to this film."
1,Saving Major WasteOfTime,"Nice special effects, nice video and sound quality, and whole bunch of people I didn't care about by the end of the flick. After all the hype, a major disappointment."
2,Poor Remake,"This is a poor remake of ""Shaving Ryan's Privates."" Although they've clearly spent a lot of money on special effects and getting in big names, it's still not a patch on the original.And what happened to that wonderful scene in the barbershop?!! It's been completely cut out in this version!!! That's like remaking Casablanca without the 'Here's looking at you. kid' scene."
1,Dull,"Apart from the opening 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes, this was the worst war film I have ever seen.tedious, lame and uninspiring with an overemotional endingjust a story about a handful of GIs arguing with each other in the French countrysideOver rated and an insult to all veterans"
5,A moving portrayal of the horrors and triumphs of war,"This movie is amazing. It is so necessary for our generation to see and respect the sacrifices made by individuals in a war that is glorified by so many. This movie shows how horrible war is, and that in the end, compassion is our most important asset."
1,The great man-child goes to war,"Evryones favorite man-child brings us his bizarre take on World War 2 and its not pretty. OK let me get this straight it was a WORLD war right. Apparently through my schooling i have been terribly lied to. I had no idea Americans single handidly won the war. And boy those Germans are some real cut ups. Mickey Mouse, Betty Grable what gams! Are you not listening to the campy B-movie dialogue in this god awful film? Speilberg needs to stop milking serious events for his own profit. Speilberg the savior of human kind. He's so caring. The Color Purple, Schindlers list, and now this. We must immediatly begin building of a spielberg temple, statues must be erected in his honor for all that he's done for us. He deserves a real pat on the back."
2,"This film is fine, as long as you're American","For those reviewers who think this film is a masterpiece, I urge you to consider one thing:IF YOU WATCHED THIS FILM, HOW INSULTED WOULD YOU BE IF YOU WERE GERMAN?We perpetuate stereotypes. We embrace jingoism. Have we really learned anything from the terrible atrocity known as war?"
4,extremely well done but americanized...,"spielberg has done what other directors should have done: not to be cliche.at first, i was kinda perplexe: why would the army send an unit to retrieve a single guy? i found it very illogical with what was happening. if it was the case, they would have done a lot of those kind of missions, which would have been even more illogical.battle scenes do not have music score (which is what others should have done) and we see what we would have seen in real combat: horror of war. nothing clean or any platoon leader think he's the best like those '60s war movie.it is also very americanized with the american flag at the beginning and at the end. it is a tribute to the american effort of the war but it also makes a small felling that lowers the effort of all the other allies: british, canadian, french resistance, chinese, australians and so on, because the flag makes you focus on USA (especially the amount of time your looking at the flag)."
5,Spielberg offers harrowing look at front-line combat,"This film is exceptional in all areas: script, production design, performances, photography, and human impact. Spielberg gets into the hearts and souls of men at war who would rather be anywhere else, but who do the job despite overwhelming adversity. An emotionally wrenching film."
3,Don't watch the last 10 minutes,"I watched it at the theater, and I thought the beginning and the middle of the movie were absolutely excellent. Towards the end, the movie became like any other war movie, and last sequence once again showed the over-the-top, over-sentimantal scene which has become an all too familiar Spielberg signature."
