2,The title doesn't lie.,"Just finished this thing from cover to cover and I gotta tell ya, the things mentioned in the book ARE commonsense. Have a question about something related to online dating? Use Google instead (or whatever search engine you prefer). This book was published in like 2002 when Yahoo Personals was still available, which explains why his critique on current dating websites are obsolete. Online dating is A LOT more competitive now than it was 10 years ago and techniques like ""end your message with a joke"" are really commonsense. Katz should've gave more specific examples on creativity by using more sample letters, etc. Again, use a search engine--it'll save you time and money, which can be spent on a Double-Double at In-N-Out if you are reading from the West Coast."
2,Contradiction,I've picked up several books on dating and everything says to keep it simple. This book makes me feel like I should be striving for an English degree as a small novel should be my profile. While I agree you need to grab a suitors interest there is a lot to be said about mystery. If you put it all on your profile what will you have to talk about?
2,Disappointed!!,"I was very excited about getting this product because I had printed patterns from a fellow home-school mom's blog to use with it. I followed the directions carefully when applying the magnetic strips to each block. The very first time my children used it, they were falling off. I am not happy about having to glue each and every magnet onto each block :( They should have been preassembled or of better quality for the price I paid for this."
3,Great busy time project for preschooler during homeschooling time,"Both of my children really enjoy this set. The down side is - there's no pattern cards that my preschooler can use - thank goodness for friends who design pattern cards! One other problem my son noticed was that some of the enclosed designs require 12 blocks of a specific color, but the set only includes 10 blocks per color."
3,"Many uses, small size","I am confused by some reviews complaining of having to glue the magnetic backing on. For the record, all of my blocks came with the magnet on the back and have lasted very nicely.We do not use this for patterning art (we have another mosaic set for that) but I use them in our homeschool mostly for math such as sequencing, counting, addition, subtraction. They are about the same size as my Math U See blocks so I use them to illustrate problems on my white board and duplicate the workbook example.My main complaint is the size. They come in a box much larger than what is needed and the photo on the front makes them appear to be larger than they really are. Buy the time I got the, home, I couldn't use them for my original intention, but was able to find some use for them.I also like that they are a nice stained wood, not plastic."
3,Not quite what I expected,"There's nothing wrong with the product. For teaching, these would be great. Just be warned that they are much smaller in person than they appear on screen. It just didn't fit my needs, which was to use them as as ""mining"" blocks for a Minecraft birthday party. I ended up going to a school supply store where I found the blocks I needed."
2,"Alternate yes, but does the author really think it's beauty?","Being a big girl myself, I was actually looking forward to this book the first time I picked it up. Then I started reading..The story itself is basic and that isn't exactly disappointing. The wording is. It is clear from the way the book is written that the author certainly doesn't find fat even remotely beautiful. From themes on how fat women are, clearly, only fat because they're pressured so hard to be thin that they overeat..to the overused emphasis on ""rolls and bumps"" and how even the main character sees these things as horrid and negative. I was truly disgusted when I finished this book.If you are going to write a book and market it under the idea of an ""uplifting"" sort of story, then please make the attempt at making the book something other than a ""why am I fat?"" lesson."
1,Greatly disappointed,"When you look at the cover it gives you the impression that it is about a woman who is a creative and proud bbw. I dont think one time in this whole book was the main character proud of herself. I have never read a character who was as depressing as Ronnie. The author constantly uses derrogetory descriptions of the big characters in the book. The whold point of this is the character Ronnie enters an alternate reality, and everyone strives to be big, where as she is fighting it. The other character seem to be proud of how they look, but in Ronnies' eyes, they are disgusting obese creatures. Not once does she find anything attractive in any character unless they are thin.Don't waste your time with this book. There is no love no romance and definately isnt any positive role models in here!"
3,a review,"This book was nothing like I expected and everything that I expected. Strange huh?Well, I expected there to be romance, which there wasn't alot of. I expected that the main character will i the end find out that who she is as a person is what really matters. Not what she looks like. I was right. Just like so many other chick lit books targeting the 'bigger' girls, so it didn't amke it all that interesting. I've read so many books like this, that this book NEEDED something to make it stand out better than the others, and it didn't.If you want to read 'bigger' girl chick lit, pass this up and go for something better. A few WAY better suggestions are 'Good in Bed' by Jennifer Weiner, 'Jemima J' by Jane Green, 'Waking Beauty' by Elyse Friedman, 'Losing It' by Lindsay Faith Rech and 'The Next Big Thing' by Johanna Edwards. All those are 4 and 5 star wonderful books, in my opinion."
3,Let down .. . .,"When I read the blurb on this book, I thought - yay! I can finally imagine a world where it's ok to be who you are - fat or thin. But the story took the entire concept to another level that I couldn't really go along with. I gave it three stars because I do like the overall message that the author was trying to convey, but I just think she could have done a better job in the execution. Don't know if I'll read books by this author again. . ."
3,a blond review,"Alternate Beauty is basically a ""good enough"" read (good enough to not abandon the book). The writing is tolerable, the premise is interesting, and the characters move one to at least feel like or dislike. The author is successful in making the reader sympathetic to overweight people in a thin society. However, I found her very hypocritical at the end of Chapter 24 when she has a character describe a breach of good judgment as a ""blond moment"". Apparently, one should not judge a fat book by its cover but it is perfectly OK to judge a blond one that way. I guess all of us should love ourselves just the way we are and have high self esteem and self worth ... unless we happen to be blond. Then we are just stupid."
2,Not a good instruction book,"This is a great book for ideas, but it doesn't give you a step by step on how to create your own memory book or journal. For the most interesting ones, it tells you some of the items they used to make it. If you already know how to create your own book, this is for you. If you are like me, and wanted a step by step, look for something else."
3,I like it but not worth it,"It does its job, it helps the car stay cooler but:1) It doesn't look that good.2) It's a real hassle to put on and off, specially if there's someone seating the passenger seat.3) It's not cheap."
1,Poor Service,"While I found this magazine to be very beneficial for a music educator or professional musician, I found the circulations department to be lacking in accuracy and efficiency. I actually receive better service from my middle school newspaper which is run by children. I am ready to call it quits with this magazine because calling them every month to see where my issue could be is driving me completely crazy! Good luck if you entertain the idea of getting this subscription.PerryDenver, CO"
1,almost duped again,Peter Frampton is not performing; not singing or playing. Listen to the tracs first.
5,BOUGHT FOR MY WHEATIES BOX,Good quality. Perfect size for cereal boxes. I bought this to store my wheaties box with Cael Sanderson the wrestling legend in. BallQube makes quality products at reasonable prices.
3,just okay,"Just as the previous comment says. It does come with direction s but it is hard to pull apart and so difficult to put back together that I can't use it for what I needed it for because I am afraid that the receiver won't be able to open nor close it. But I too, will hold on to it."
2,Cereal Box Display,"I purchased this for a Wheaties Box sports figure - Seth Wescott. The two pieces of the cube are difficult to pull apart and more difficult to put back together. I broke an edge pulling the pieces apart and I can't get the two pieces to seal together tightly. The directions were extremely minimal and not helpful. I did keep the cube, however when I find a better one, I'll replace this one because it doesn't do the ""protection"" job I purchased it for."
4,"A well written, interesting book with a fresh viewpoint.",This is an excellent book providing an interesting alternative viewpoint of historical events that have been reviewed extensively. The author writes with an engaging style which maintains the readers interest throughout the text. The only fault in this excellent book is the number of typographical errors in the text in one case leading to a small factual error. The Dauphine Estates General met at the town of Vizille not Virille as shown in the text.But still a very enjoyable book!
5,Illuminating and down to earth,"One of the best introductory books I've seen. It is concise, and yet very illuminating and down to earth, leading very nicely into the beginnings of algebraic number theory."
5,I'm a recent convert to Inspector Banks mysteries.,"If you enjoy English detectives, offbeat plots, WW2 era setting, nice dose of romance, you will have a good time reading Peter Robinson."
5,Excellent,"This is my first Inspector Banks novel and it won't be my last. A wonderful story within a story with beautifully crafted language, human characters, wonderful history not only of life in rural Britain during WWII but glimpses of the 60s as well. It spanned such a time frame. And the murderer was clearly a reasonable suspect from a psychological standpoint. I enjoyed the different points of view regarding the character of the murder victim and the different narrations of the story,i.e., Gwen's narration of the murder's background, Vivian""s excerpts, the investigation of Inspector Banks within the context of his complicated life and that of DS Cabbot, i.e., Annie. Well done!"
4,cookie,I enjoyed this author alot. I will pick more of his books to read. I am always looking for good authors in this genre.
5,Didn`t know it`s part of a series of books,"This book was one of the last books I bought in Germany before I immigrated to the US and finally I read it on my honeymoon.I picked the book because I was always fascinated by flooded towns(I strongly recommend ""Under the Lake"" by Stuart Woods)in dams, so this one definitely fulfilled all my expectations.But I don`t think I`ll read his other books. Usually those series of books by Martha Grimes and Elizabeth George etcetera are very repititious, the first one or two books are usually quite promising and the third is just a variation of the same theme."
4,another wonderful Inspector Banks mystery.,"I put off reading the latest Peter Robinson mystery because it is such a treat when a new one is published that I wanted to savor the moment. Although I found the plot a little stale (I know I have read at least one other mystery where a body is found in a village which had been buried under water until the reservoir dried up), I still enjoyed the sharp character portrayals at which the author is so skilled. I'll be eagerly waiting the next one."
1,"Plodding, predictable plot; dull characters","Very disappointing. Weak plot, boring characters, particularly the main one, Inspector Banks (even his angst is tedious), and a story that should have been told in 150 pages combine for a very weak novel. Only the last 30 pages come alive (also, a few with Gloria). I am truly astonished by the reader reviews and professional critiques. For those interested in crime fiction and psychological suspense you will have to read Breakheart Hill for the psychological element and Void Moon for the crime fiction. Then find a copy of Andrew Taylor's Four Last Things, quite simply the finest suspense novel of all time."
3,3 1/2 Stars -- Well-Written But Not Very Exciting!,"In A Dry Season is a very written written book with well-developed, multi-dimensional characters, and a descriptive style that makes you feel that you are right there in the small English town in which the story takes place. What it is not, however, is a mystery that has a lot of excitement, suspense and surprises; which is what I was looking for when I decided to read this book. My 3 1/2 star rating is based on the fact that the book did not deliver well enough on my in-going expectations. Nonetheless, Peter Robinson is a very good writer and I will know better about what to expect from him the next time I decide to read one of his books. And there will be a next time. If you are in the mood for a mystery that is built more on character development versus one built more on plot development than In A Dry Season is a book I think you might enjoy very much."
5,Robinson's done it again!,"Human bones, wrapped in a World War II blackout curtain, are found in a reservoir, and it is soon determined that they are the bones of a young woman who was strangled and stabbed several times. Inspector Alan Banks joins Sergeant Annie Cabbott in looking into the matter. Their investigation takes them back in history, to a time when the reservoir was a village, and the war was being fought.This is the tenth novel in the series, and Robinson just gets better and better. The book was extremely well written. The story alternates between time periods and narrators, giving readers unique perspectives on the events. All the characters were interesting, and the plot was full of surprises and suspense. I love the Banks character, so I was happy to see elements of Alan's personal life, including his relationships with his son and co-worker, mixed in with the main plot. This is one book that shouldn't be missed."
4,Compelling,"""In A Dry Season"" is a finely crafted novel, a very compelling tale which weaves a stunning plot much in the style of recent gems like ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or ""Black Notice"", or even books of a more techno-thriller bent like ""The Devil's Teardrop."" Four stars from me, the only weakness was a lack of effort at effective characterization."
5,What a Great Book!,"Elizabeth George is my ""gold standard"" for psychological/social mysteries. ""In a Dry Season"" was right up there. I could hardly put it down. Peter Robinson did a great job of meshing the reminiscing with the present day's investigation of the murder. Character development was really well done, so I felt like I knew the characters. Although the vocabulary and the descriptions of Great Britain's classes were less complex than Ms. George's, the writing was excellent. A really great read."
3,Didn't fulfill its potential,"Too long, too long. This book needed thoughtful editing to tighten the pacing and plot. Too much repetition and rambling. I liked the setting, character development, history, and clever plot, but not as much as I would have with a sharper focus."
3,"long winded, please get thyself a good editor...","The mystery part of the book was good. I was not fully satisfied with certain parts of the resolution of the murder, as well as the two additional murders revealed at the very end. To say more would reveal spoilers, which I do not want to do.What really irritated me: the unnecessary descriptions of places and people who didn't matter, the whole love affair, the failing marriage and ruminations upon it, and the TWO women who were interested in Inspector Banks. If there was some prudent editing, it would be a good book. The way it is now, it drags in parts because of all the unnecessary baggage which has to be carried."
5,Robinson just gets better...,"I've enjoyed reading the entire Banks series and, for sheer storytelling, this is his best. Robinson does not write nail-biting mysteries. What he does write are thoughtful stories full of interesting characters. It is becoming more difficult to find good, character-based mysteries to hold your interest. If, like me, you like good characters and excellent writing and storytelling, also try Reginald Hill's Dalziel and Pascoe stories. In fact, his On Beulah Height is very similar to In A Dry Season (although he wrote his first)."
3,Less is More,"I enjoyed the first half of this book and thought that perhaps it was in a different category from the others in the series, as the reviews suggested. But I grew tired of the constant rapid cuts between past and present--Robinson would have done better to give fewer and more extended sections. And the war-time characters and period detail wore thin. I was skimming by the end."
2,Not quite as exciting as the jacket describes....,"I found the book to be slow moving and at times hard to follow. I didn't get caught up in the story until I got to about page 150, I had to continue to read in hopes that the book would eventually become exciting, as exciting as the jacket described it to be.The main thing about this book is that there is three main stories with many subplots. There was way too much information given about minor characters. However, the main character, Alan Banks, although a bit strange was a very strong character. Eventually you get halfway through the book and the story becomes interesting, but unfortunately, I figured out who the murderer was early on in the story. It seemed as though it was difficult for Peter Robinson to keep the story moving forward. It wasn't the worst book I've read, but it could have been better."
2,Too complicated for most hobbyists,"While the book itself is great, and shows how to build an ""industrial (almost)strength"" type machine, the required complexity and construction, are beyond the ability of many hobbyists (as well as being relatively expensive). In particular, it requires welding and fabrication skills not generally available to the home hobbyist. Having said that, there is much to be learned, and using some of instructions and resources in the book, many people could easily build (as I intend) to build a somewhat simpler version, than is shown in this book."
5,"Balance among scholarship, history and performance practice","This book takes a balance view among music analysis, history as well as performance practice. For those who need only one definite study on Bach's greatest work could consider this as first choice!"
4,Phyl,"If U R an avid fan of throwback black cinema as I am, then U would love this film. Even though times have changed, there is something in this film U can ID with. Max Julian plays the suave ""MACK DADDY"" so natually, U wonder if pimping was really his line of work. The late Richard Pryor supports him beautifully & comically, and Mosely is convincing as the brother who works hard to rid the streets of the character his brother portrays.A don't miss!"
4,Better the second go 'round,"This was a popular drinking movie while I was in college and we loved it then. However, 12 years later I decided to check it out again as a 30-something sober man and you know what The Mack is actually a decent movie. It was even better than what I remember from college. This is a classic blaxploitation film, a must see for this genre."
2,poor quality.,"Don't recommend this at least from the store ipurchased this from cause the clarity seemed asthough it's copied or fuzzy on certain parts andi gave this movie away cause of this. Thumbsdown, also to this store on DVD's."
3,P.I.M.P Mode,"I only seen the TV version on B.E.T, so i saw this dvd for cheap, so i decided to buy it. Its an okay movie, but Max Julien made a good pimp on this movie, he played his part well."
2,Like Movie But Dislike Quality,I purchase this movie for my collection and really enjoy the average quality picture since it was an old movie not recorded in HD and I got it for a cheap price. One thing I notice while viewing this movie was that it was a video copy from someone placing a camcorder in front of a TV recording this movie camera with the close-capture words at the bottom of the scream. At first I thought that my close-capture was on but further examination show that this was a second rate DVD. I’m going to keep this DVD with the close-capture but no further orders from this company.
3,Pimpin' Ain't Easy!,"Before ""Hustle & Flow"", before ""Snoop Dogg"", there was ""The Mack"". This film was made in 1973, and it shows. Watching this film is like going into a time warp with all the platform shoes, the polyester and the fancy cars. And the 'hoes! Don't forget the 'hoes! This film was actually made in Oakland and had real life pimps as technical advisors. The storyline doesn't bore you to death. And the legendary Richard Pryor gives a standout performance that entertains as well as gives you some laughs. If you remember the 70's or if you want to get a taste of what it was like back then, give this film a try."
1,"Trash Can Juice as ""cautionary tale""","This film is supposed to be a cautionary tale against the pimp lifestyle. However, all this bunch of TRASH CAN JUICE (as one of my college roomates put it) really does is glorify pimping with Max Julien's flashy clothes, fine women, sleek cars, and the infamous ""player's ball"" (along with the fact that he provides for his mama). What poor kid in the ghetto wouldn't want to live like this? This makes Julien's militant, anti-pimping brother look like a babbling fool (despite the violent ending). Naw, the last thing that people need in the ghettoes are more pimps, and films like this that have glorified pimping for 2 generations."
2,Too much Hype!,"I had heard so much about this. Rappers talked about it. Rappers acted like him, but this film is not at all what I expected. Keeping in mind that I saw it on VHS and the quality was very questionable for Blockbuster.Anyway, this Mack in my mind was to be a powerful pimp who took no s**t. Instead, he is a laughing all of the time, guy who seems to not be concerned with what's going on around him.I won't go into details as I don't want to waste much more time on a film like this, but it is hard to watch and one of the corniest of the 1970's black films, or films starring more black people than white people, so they are black. I did not want to see this again. Most of those films I keep in my mind with the idea of adding them to the collection, but not this one. This film has too much hype! Where is ""Three the Hard Way"" on DVD?"
1,The Mack,I never received the THE MACK DVD. I had to email the company that I purchased the movie from and i was reimbursed the amount charged to my credit card. I was very disappointed and will not purchase from that company again.
4,pimpin good,I saw this a long time ago.I remember is how cool and smooth goldie is. this movie influence hip hop so much. The lead character gold make many special apperaces in rap videos and movies.
5,very memorable,this film is tight not only the acting but also the soundtrack by willie hutch.this film is very real and a reality check all at once.you have to find yourself and you can't be foul all your life.cuz everybody's in the game.and the relationship between mother and son puts everything into perspective.
5,One Vicious A$$ Piece of Jelly,"One of my favorite movies of all time. Sad at times funny as well, but also some serious parts. Maybe not today but there are many stories like this from that time. This movie tells a story of truth that can really occur.This and Scarface are probably the most quoted movies of all time in music. I know I hear lines from this movie and others but a lot of lines from this movie in music I listen to. I guess you know I don't listen to country and western.Some of the highlights is the Player's Picnic, Player's Ball and maybe my favorite the planetarium. That is a classic part. Very funny. There are some cold blooded lines and scences but it all equals a classic. Due to the topic and being a black exploitation flick will never receive its just due. If you want the inspiration for Pimps Up and Hoes Down get into some books like From Pimpstick to Pulpit ""It's Magic"" The Life Story of Don ""Magic"" Juan, records by Rudy Ray Moore and this movie The Mack."
5,Classic,the Dvd Version of this Film takes it to a whole different level.I always dug the Film but after getting all of the bonus footage&commentary on Dvd it gave the film even more edge.Max Julien broke so many things down&it was Poetic the way things were broken down.this film dealt with so many things that still haven't been unresolved.it deals with very real life issues.Pimping comes in all walks of life.Presidents on down Pimp that is the way of the world.this film doesn't make it cool it shows how empty all partys involved in this life truly are at the end of the day.
2,Classic,"I din't expect to like this movie, but I did. I especially enjoyed the documentary of the movie with the actors and other historical film professionals."
1,Same ole Same ole,"Interesting that the book is the same as all other marketing books. Same ole, same ole. As I read, it seemed like I was reading a hodge podge of all the ideas that have been in print for years. Putting them all in one book, claiming ""different"", flys in the face of the subject matter. Not for me."
2,Ultimate V-Twin Chassis,"I have been contemplating building my dream bike and picked up this book to learn more on about the chassis of a bike. This book provides some good basic information, namely the different manufacturers. However, I think it could have went into more detail on things like the geometry of the frame or effects of swing arm length. In alot of instances, instead of going into detail the writer points you towards your local shop for info. There were plenty of pictures but overall not much text. It felt like a lot of the pictures where there just to make the book longer."
2,Could have been much better.....,"Pretty pictures, but in all a very shallow book about the basics of creating a bike by bolting together purchased componenents. Just one page devoted to discussing trail, and only a vague sentence or two on how it effects handling. Then, a complete chapter on how a pro shop fabricates a frame. Interesting, but anyone with the ability to actually make a frame won't be impressed by the knowledge presented, and anyone without the ability will be no closer to it by reading. The book seems thrown together; too much info here, not nearly enough there."
4,"If you know nothing, its a start","If you are like me, and have never built a chopper, only riden rice burners, it has good information. Perhaps, I could have gotten all of this knowledge from the internet, but I wanted a place to start. That's what this book is, a start. You could probably sum the book up in 20 pages and saved some trees, but the book in whole was worth the 13 or so dollars I spent on it."
1,A bad way to spend bucks,"I have read this book only once time, it tooks me about 1 hour, It is very basic, have not any important info, else that you can get from a free catalog"
1,save the trees,THEAIR were some good info like what rake and strech was and diffrent metals other then that it was a no-brainer with about as much excitment as picking the lint out of your belly button
2,So-So,"This book could use a lot more information, judging by its name, i couldnt even tell what its about. U.X.L?"
5,Great workout - great results :->,"Again Amazon is late releasing this - you can buy it online elsewhere. I got my copy the other day and have already done this a couple of times. I think Ellen is a great instructor. She's encouraging and motivating and easy to listen to and she cues well.This workout is Pilates/ballet/balance and the like. It's a relaxing workout and while it's not cardio, your heart can be elevated if you find the moves a bit challenging. I love the mermaid movements and the dancer plies. It may look easy but while doing it, it's a good challenge and you can feel it the next day for sure. It's not an intimidating workout if you aren't familiar with the moves - just watch the dvd through once or twice before trying it out.It's about 45 minutes all up and it works you out really well. I like this a lot and I'm going to try doing it 3 times a week along with plenty of cardio."
5,My new favorite workout,"What a great workout! Not the same old thing. After doing the video for the first time yesterday, I feel just the right amount of soreness that tells me I worked out arms and legs in a meaningful way-- and I enjoyed the workout tremendously. A wonderful complement to weight routines-- lots of nice lengthening moves. It's clear that a lot of thought and preparation went into the design of the routine. And Ellen has got to be the least irritating video trainer I have experienced in a long time. The cueing is excellent. I could not be more enthusiastic. I immediately bought several more of her videos and am eagerly awaiting delivery."
4,Love Ellen,"I really enjoyed this workout. It provides a lot of different variations for anyone, no matter the fitness level to be able to follow. I have to say there are a lot of piles and tone, ankle, pointing. So, if your not used to ballet this can cause your ankles and feet to get sore or cramp up. Other than that.. nice DVD. Ellen's cues are excellent, her smile and information about what you are doing and why you are doing it are amazing! This is a must have for any fitness collection."
5,She did it again!,"I have being using 3 other Ellen's DVDs and when this is available on Amazon I immediately purchased it. I got it 2 weeks ago, and have been using it 5 or 6 times- I definitely LOVE this one. Ellen is a great instructor like all other reviewers said, and I just love everything about this DVD. The music is enjoyable and you can follow the temple easily; the movement is natural while challenging enough you'll feel it after you're done. Also, the length of the workout fits my everyday schedule perfectly- I don't need to find anything else to do after this DVD because I'll get everything I needed within the 45 minutes workout. Again, I'd highly recommend to those who love Ellen's style, natural movement and just enjoyable workout."
3,Sssooooo Booorrring!,"I am a huge fan of Ellen Barrett. I fully expected to love this DVD. I did not. I have several of her other workouts-Crunch - Fat Burning Pilates,Crunch - Super SlimDown: Pilates Yoga Blend, andCrunch - Burn & Firm Pilates. While doing this workout, I kept thinking how much Fat Burning Fusion felt like Burn & Firm Pilates without the weights. BUT, Burn & Firm Pilates is a much more superior workout because there are some challenging parts to it and it moves a lot faster. Fat Burning Fusion moved way too slowly and the moves were uninteresting and repetitive. It barely got my heart rate up and I couldn't wait for it to be over."
3,"A little bored, a little achy","While there is no doubt that Ellen is a talented teacher, I found this particular video to be uninspiring and ache-inducing. I would not recommend this video for anyone who has knee problems due to the high repetition of plies. I would recommend Melissa Lowe's Ballet Workout for a ballet class workout. I found my knees didn't bother me while doing the Ballet Workout as long as I modified the grand plies to plies. For all-around fun DVDs that include jazz, ballet, modern dance yoga, Bollywood, burlesque and Latin dancing, I recommend the Yoga Booty Ballet series. The teachers can be a little over-the-top on the metaphysical comments sometimes, but I always have fun working out with them. Good music, fun moves, beautiful scenery, great results."
2,Mixed feelings...,"While this is gentle on the body if you have back/knee issues, it's BORING and repetitious. It drove me crazy.Just when you think, thank GOD this is almost done, you realize you still have the OTHER side of your body to work out. After a half an hour, frankly, I was done! Not physically, but mentally.I did feel the burn the next day and it honestly helped my torn rotator cuff, BUT the thought of doing it again left little to be desired. I like to either work both sides of my body one after the other or at the same time. I think it's just a mental thing, but it makes the time seem to go by faster.If you don't mind this, this is a great workout; if you DO mind it, keep looking for others out there that offer great benefits without the mental strain (i.e. Leslie Sansone, my fave)!"
3,Tough? No. Effortless? No way!,"I am a veteran of Cathe Freiderich and P90X workouts. This workout delivers a less intense, but certainly not effortless exercise. It was about two-thirds of the way through when the perspiration started to turn into real sweat, but unfortunately the intensity didn't last long. I liked the the gracefulness and elegance of the moves - something you don't get a lot of in Cathe workouts or P90X workouts.Ellen Barrett is an encouraging and positive instructor. Her voice is pleasant to listen to and her smile is mega-wattage!In the section entitled ""Welcome to the Studio"", I got the sense that there was not an outright 'anti-weights' vibe but instead a 'you don't need to lift heavy weights' vibe, which I thought was unfortunate. Women should be lifting weights - and heavy ones too, to optimize the benefits to not just their muscles but their bones, especially.A great workout for an 'easy day'. Very recommended!"
5,KICKS A$$,"Holy crap this is a good workout. If you want something that tones, stretches, sculpts AND raises your heartrate, without causing a lot of stress and impact to the body, this is the DVD for you. There are some days where I can't even get through the whole thing because it works you out so well. You really need to pace yourself and not overdo it, as it can poop you out quickly and impact completing the workout. Ellen is great, her cues are perfect, she is good about monitoring correct form amd posture, and she encourages you to go at your own pace and do what is best for you. If you want to feel the burn, for days, and feel like you accomplished a workout, this is the one for you."
4,"Good solid shoe, though some inconsistency is annoying.","I've purchased a few of these shoes over the past couple years and I'm generally very pleased with them. They fit my foot well and are one of the most comfortable shoes that I've been able to find with suede/leather toe and a thick tongue.My only real complaint is that there seems to be some inconsistency across the range of shoes that are classified as ""Court Graffik SE."" One of the things I like best about these shoes is the elastic straps that hold the tongue in place, but unfortunately my most recent pair appears to be missing these elastic straps. As far as I can tell, it seems that the straps are present in some colors/combinations but not all of them. For instance, my previous pair (""Black/Green/Monostar"") have the straps but the pair that I just purchased (""Army Brush Camo"") do not. :("
1,waste of money,This product isnt any good it doent charge the battery. i bought it as a backup charger cause it came with a car adapter which would have been gret if it the product actually worked!
3,Out Run with smashing,"Chase HQ made for a brilliant arcade game but was always rather disappointing on home consoles. Chase HQ II here on the Genesis is actually the home version of arcade spin-off S.C.I.: Special Criminal Investigation. The REAL Chase HQ from Taito came out in the year 2008.Basically this is just your average racing game with the usual countdown clock, hazards and boosts. The twist is that instead of reaching a checkpoint you have to ram into a crooks car until it breaks down. You can do this kind of thing to much more satisfying effect in any modern GTA game, so the early Chase HQ games seem kinda primitive by comparison.You get a choice between a sports car, a 4x4 or a big rig truck at the start of each mission, they all have their ups and downs but all feel clunky and stiff. There's no real sense of speed, not in the least bit helped by the basic graphic design.Graphics CSound CGameplay B-Lasting Appeal B-"
1,Prevention & 1st aid treatment if chidhood injuries,Don't bother. The information is out of date and some of the tips are dangerous. It's a poor quality tape and a waste of money
5,Some of the most classic songs all in one CD!!!!!,"The Wayne's World Soundtrack is great! My favorite songs are: Bohemian Rhapsody, Dream Weaver, Ballroom Blitz, Loving your lovin', Foxy Lady, Feed my Frankenstein, and the Wayne's World Theme. The only songs that are TOTALLY terrible are: Sikamakanico, and Rock Candy. Bohemian Rhapsody and Ballroom Blitz are two of my ultimate favorite songs. If you're a fan of great music,buy this CD!"
3,"""Schwiiiing"".","This soundtrack includes about what you would expect it to. Mostly hard and classic rock, with a good ""Chili Peppers"" song thrown in. It starts with the huge hit ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", which turned a new generation onto ""Queen"". There's also tracks for the movie, two from ""Tia Carrere"", and the movie's theme song as well. Plus random hair bands. This is a fun disc, but unless it's your favorite movie, I wouldn't call it a must-have. But if you like it, check out ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"", and ""Beavis And Butthead's"" cd too."
5,an awesome sountrack,"i bought this album really for one song, sikamikanico (which people have been saying bad stuff about the song and the chili peppers, and i have to disagree). but all i can say is its such a cool soundtrack. i dont think there is 1 song that i dont like on it. even the one with mike myers and dana carvey is ok. all in all if you liked waynes world (great movie) or just 1 song on the cd, get it because youll love it!"
4,A great soundtrack!,"the waynes world soundtrack is hella tight! the songs by tia carrere are really good and the song by queen is cool...if you like light metal, get this cd..i garantee you'll love it...yup...it's great!"
1,Waste of Time and Money,"With 3100 sq ft of ceramic tile and 5 long coated dogs in residence, a true upright vacuum to replace my trusty but short lived Eureka Boss stickbrooms seemed like a dream come true. However, that was possibly the worst use of $240 imaginable. I can run over the same little bit of dirt numerous times, then go get either the Eureka or the Shark electric broom to actually get it up. The concept is sound, and so many of us would more than welcome a true, efficient cordless vacuum, but folks, this ain't it. Last night my husband came home with a new Oreck, cord and all....after going through two battery packs vacuuming with The Beast (apt nickname considering size and weight), the Oreck pulled up twice what was in The Beast's canister and did it, even with moving the plug around in less than a third the amount of time.Sign me still waiting in Southern California....http://www.morganriver.com"
1,Just heaved it!,It took me a year to do this but finally I've had enough and I gave it a good heave out into the backyard making sure nobody would suffer the pain of using this despicable piece of junk.
4,Westinghouse - You can be sure,"I really love the convenience of not having to plug into a socket, of never not having enough cord and having to go unplug the unit and move it to a new location. I like the fact that I wont run over the cord with the brush and have to replace it because I frayed it with the brush. It has plenty of cleaning power, I have a dark brown carpet so I need to vacuum frequently. It is super easy to empty the canister, the batteries last a little longer than the 1/2 that they claim, you are never without power, they are also very easy to change, the only flaw I found was it didn't get close enough to the edge for my taste, with the dark carpet I can even see light dust. Of course that's what the attachments are for, but if it had edge cleaning capabilities I would consider it the perfect vacuum. It does a great cleaning job, it's easy to use, and easy to maintain."
1,"No, it doesn't work, and don't count on your warranty...","The unit's brushes become clogged with junk, mainly hair, and then shut off every 10 seconds to 1 minute. Yes, we've taken it apart; yes, the batteries are conditioned and charged fully; no, my carpet is not tall. After several calls to Salton (Westinghouse's distributor) they sent me a replacement that was dirtier and more dinged up than my own vacuum and had the same problem out of the box. They did apologize and send another; however, the money-back part of your warranty they say is only if the product is discontinued. This review is my vindication :)"
1,No Sales,"I work in a large retail store e.g. kmart/walmart and work in housewares. We have now carried this cordless vacuum for 3 months and have not sold a single one. We let all customers turn the vacuums on and check displays out before purchasing and even though it is the easiest for me to display, since I don't have to run to an outlet everytime someone wants to turn it on, it is a waste of my time as no one is interested once they get to really check it out. It's bulk and weight are a large turnoff followed by it's lack of power. Yes I conditioned the batteries. Westinghouse spent too much time making it look cool rather then making it work."
3,A love / hate relationship.,"First, there was a six month learning curve on ""locking"" the hose in place but it was so convient I persisted. We sent back one battery 3 times before it held a charge and 30 minutes was not near long enough to vacuum my house and furniture(necessary with a toddler).Now neither battery works and will probably do work necessary to replace at least one of them because of the investment and the convience.Cleans window sills well.Does not work on shag carpet. Gets stuck. Most of my floors are wood so it works fine. But, my oreck will pick up stuff this one leaves behind and it doesn't fit under counter edges as well as the oreck either. All in all I would still use both vacuums for different jobs if I had another battery."
1,Returned before even trying!!!,"I did not even try this vacuum! Once I read the maintenance schedule for the unit it went back!! It has 4 filters with 4 different cleaning frequencies and four different cleaning methods! Give me a break! The Editorial review on this site says ""life long HEPA filter"", very deceiving as it doesn't mention the other three! I would not recommend this vacuum."
2,Clogs Constantly -- Sooo Frustrating,"I purchased this vac at Target mainly because of its cordless feature. It worked great when I first got it; however, within a few months it was clogging constantly and not getting my carpets clean. I have to disassemble the bottom compartment and empty it every time I use this vac. even though I go around and pick up all the bits of leaves, crumbs, paper, etc. before vacuuming. After only 16 months or so I am about to replace it. I have kept the filters clean, and the batteries charged and conditioned as recommended - this doesn't seem to help. Also, the onboard tools (brushes, crevice tool) fall out of their holders constantly. Perhaps this vac would be ok for someone with no pets, kids or heavy foot traffic, but it is definitely not up to any type of heavy use."
1,"This vacuum doesn't suck &#65533; have suction, that is","Contrary to the main Amazon review posted with this product, I bought the Westinghouse WST1600 Unplugged Cord-Free Vacuum and I have just sent it back. I thought it was too good to be true, and it was. The power was pitiful; emitting a weak whirring sound more like a fast-food giveaway toy than an almost-$300 appliance, it dragged more dust and fuzz across the floor than it picked up, and the amber light started flashing that the battery charge was almost spent, WAY before the advertised half hour. (Yes, I had fully conditioned the batteries for 48 hours before starting). I really wanted to love this machine, because other than its lack of pick-up power, it is beautifully designed, and all of its parts would seem to fit together perfectly and fulfill their mission with ease -- if only it would suck."
1,Very Unsatisfied,"If you like recharging ever 10 minutes, cleaning HEPA and other filters often and pushing dirt around your house this vacuum is for you. Just another product with bells and whistles and no substance."
2,Hit or miss,"This is a solid unit at a great price, but be warned that these are often imperfectly milled and may come warped. I read other people complain about this after purchasing the various versions out there, I just purchased one, and sure enough it's just a tad warped where I cannot fully insert a towbar into it. The top bike-rack mount is fine, but the main receiver is just that much bent where the only possible way I could get the towbar inserted into it would be using a sledgehammer and I'm not going to ruin my towbar."
3,hitch,the hitch works as described/ the fit and finish leaves a little to be desired. Top and bottom reciever were not excactly parallel and the weld inside the reciever needed to be filed down a bit so the hitch would fit in to it.
4,good product,"Very sturdy, but it is rusting on me. Suits the application we were looking for. Holds the bike and the cargo carier."
3,Good but some flaws,First let me say I am always amazed at how easily people will give a 5 star rating to a product. I have hundreds of music/concert dvds & I can think of only a few that are worthy of 5 stars.Not a huge C.C. fan but do like their studio versions on cd. 2 flaws I noticed immediately on this dvd that un-surprisingly no one else has mentioned:1. For a blu-ray video I didn't notice anything really special about the video quality. Hard to tell the difference from standard def. Other concert blu-rays the colors & crispness really jump off the screen but not this one.2. The lead singers voice doesn't do justice to the studio versions of their songs. Some songs aren't even close to their original versions. Maybe it was the end of a long tour or something...but kind of disappointing.Still a slightly better than average dvd...& I disagree strongly with reviewers who give this 5 stars.
4,Very good!,"It is a good disk, high quality and very original.The bad apple:Expensive, more than 20 bucks."
4,Doesn't add too much,"It's a nice DVD, but after seeing the Capoeira Rodas, it doesn't add much. The mastres are indeed showing impressive ability, but you'd see similar thing in the rodas. Their stories are not that much inspiring. You'd also hear people telling how great is Capoeira for them. But people tend to glorify their hobbies, and if you love Capoiera, it won't matter to you what great things it did or didn't do to others."
5,Beautiful and functional,"Just received this lovely egg dishHIC Porcelain Deviled Egg Dish 13-inch, and am very pleased! Deviled eggs are something I make frequently, and this plate is a lovely vehicle for presenting the eggs. I love that it is just a basic bright white, will go with any background, from basic picnic to elegant dinner party."
5,Great Deviled Egg Presentation,My wife loves this! It holds plenty of eggs and has a little spot in the center to put stuff (condiments).
5,"Very nice, sturdy product","For the money, this is definitely the best egg dish you're gonna find. It's very nice solid white porcelain and it seems pretty sturdy. I bought two!"
4,Fun beat'n'bash..,"This game is fun and easily beatable first time around. So if you're looking for something to beat and take time doing so, I highly recomend this one. I personally like it very much."
5,Pediatric Surgery,"This is the new edition of the ""classic"" textbook of Pediatric Surgery. It is the most comprehensive text available on the subject, a must for all practicing pediatric surgeons and aspiring pediatric surgeons. Perhaps a bit too comprehensive for non-pediatric surgeons looking for a simple reference book to keep on their shelf. Nevertheless, even in its fifth edition, this remains the ""bible"" of Pediatric Surgery."
2,Poor Reliability,"Had this unit 1 month and the motor locked up, took Bostitch repair center 3 weeks to fix, told me it was a common problem they were seeing with this unit. I wish I bought the Makita instead.***6 month update---broke again, this time I am getting it fixed and selling it...and buying the Makita...I have 4 Bostitch nailers and like them..VERY dissapointed in Bostitch on this one, Bostitch customer service has been no help."
1,Motor freezes up,"The motor on my compressor consistently sticks, even when connected to a 20 amp wall circuit. I have taken the compressor in for service, but the problems persist. Generally, I like Bostitch tools, but they really missed the mark with this one."
3,Heavy Bear That Misses The Little Details,This compressor is very heavy and the handles aren't quite in the optimal location to carry it easily. The tank drains are nice ball valves but are in the wrong location to properly drain the tanks. You are forced to tilt and rock this heavy unit to get most of the water out. One of my hose connections has failed and now simply passes air. I need to replace it and will do so with better brass fittings.
1,..........AWFUL,"do not for one second think this is one of those campily entertaining movies. this is just bad. A goofy looking caveman kid goes on a killing spree on a bunch of campers. this guy is the worst ""slasher"" I've seen so far. No cool mask, no mysterious or supernaturality, just some young dude with a mullet, bad teeth and a caveman outfit. The actors in this movie are extremely unattractive, how did these people get into a movie? Right from the start, you know this is bad because the title slides in from the right and it seriosly looks like a power point presentation. terrible. avoid it like the plague."
4,In This Age of Technology,"Cyberjihad, by Robert Lanzone, is a thrilling novel linking computer communications, terrorists, and the security of our world. Lanzone uses terminology that is specific yet accessible to any reader, regardless of computer experience. At the opening of each chapter, he uses a timeline that creates a strong, compelling and suspenseful need to read on! I really enjoyed this book and recommend it highly!"
3,Baltimore Bullet,Not a great movie unless you are a pool fan.Anything with James Coburn can't be all bad.
3,It was OK...,"Being in the financial services I am always looking for new and exciting books in my field...sadly, this is not one of them. The book was dry and made for a long read.The upside is that the authors seem to know what they are talking about and are able to explain the ideas behind a variety of different asset protection strategies.The authors also explain the benefits and drawbacks of each asset protection strategy, though they do not go into very much detail on some of their ideas.One of the reasons is probably because at the end of the book, they provide their website as a reference. I don't have a problem with that, but it would have been nice if they had been able to make the information more interesting so that you didn't feel like you had to go to their website to ""get the good stuff""."
5,Above the Norm,"Asset protection is a good practical sense guide on the areas of trust, business entities and a dose of reality. If your at a point where the accumulated assets is worth protecting for yourself, spouse, kids and family then this is the book to read. Its not too technical but down to earth business sense. I find this book is geared to people that have some familarity with the business environment. If you know why you want to protect your assets then this book is the next step."
4,"Interesting book, but little outdated.","It covers a number of advanced strategies to help your client, some of which might be a little outdated in light of the recent development of law. However, I love the author's honest approach and have found some of the chapters quite informative. I would definitely love to see a 2nd edition soon."
5,Well spent,"The most exciting strategy advocated in this book might be the riskiest. Chapter 20 covers Series LLCs - a very attractive concept. I researched Series LLCs further and discovered that they're not appropriate for most types of businesses and that there isn't a lot of case law supporting them. In a legal battle, the owner of this type of entity is in my view likely to incur high legal expenses.One of the things I appreciated most about this book is the logical flow of coverage. The chapters seem to flow in naturally and in a way that timely grounds the reader in prerequisite knowledge. I think anybody interested in asset protection will benefit from reading this book."
5,New Hero needing advice,"As a human with newly acquired superpowers, I found this book invaluable in my quest to become a Superhero. I especially enjoyed the chapters on writing a secret origin bio, choosing the right costume combinations to enhance my physique and adding a secret headquarters to my existing domicile.You can't go wrong with this book in my opinion and I am sure the next time I am facing my arch enemy, Reduction-in-Force Man, I will be well prepared for battle.Two gauntlet covered thumbs up. Go get it and begin a rewarding career as a Superhero thwarting the Forces of Evil.So says Captain Cubicle."
3,a little disappointed,"I was hoping this would be a companion to the delightful How to be a Villain. I was sorely disappointed. It was clearly written with the tongue firmly in cheek as expected. What I did not expect was that it would be laced with a liberal dose of sexual commentary and advocating use of drugs to acquire super powers!?! My pre-teens and teens love the How to be a Villain, but How to be a SuperHero is clearly intended for older readers who are unlikely to be as devoted or hysterically amused."
2,Needs better illustrations!,"Book is kinda funny, but could have seriously benefitted from the attentions of a better illustrator. The gag just get's old without some more exciting visual support. *yawn*"
1,The not-really Celtic Tarot,"While the deck has the traditional Celtic interwoven knots and designs and mentions figures from Celtic mythology, I didn't get much of a Celtic feel from it. There are almost no animals in it and no trees, not even in the Hanged Man card. Pagan Celtic mythology is strongly overlaid--to the point of being muffled and erased--with Christianity, Greek zodiacs, and the Olympic pantheon. (A Valentine's cupid in the Lovers card, and Janus as the Celtic god of death?) Sexuality is not positively portrayed. The woman in the Lovers card crouches over, hiding her breasts, and Queen Margawse is characterized as ""fatally flawed"" because she is lustful. The Culdees are described as holding onto the remnants of Druidism and being a ""lower cultus of spiritual development."" There are no pictures for 1-10 of the minor arcana, only symbols, and I found that difficult to relate to. I gave this deck away a week after I bought it."
3,A little rough.,"This does the job and I like the small compartments, but it isn't finished so the wood looks cheap. Also, when it's closed, there are two layers of wood on the front and back. It's a little awkward expanding and retracting it because the wood isn't finished."
3,confussed by shipment,"I did receive my order, however I was confussed to find that two of the same item were sent in the same box to me. I ordered one item, yet I was charged for two which I did receive. It took over 2 weeks to receive my item(s). I thought they forgot my order and I sent a message to the company to remind them."
3,Very stiff and somewhat limited,"I found it VERY difficult to ""expand"" to make it as long as possible, and when I finally made it work, it turned out to be much smaller than I expected (I guess when I checked the compartment dimensions, I measured poorly). It's in our kitchen's ""junk"" drawer and is sort of useful for that purpose, but the individual compartments are mostly too small to hold what I wanted them to.Also, the ""natural"" wood finish means it's raw wood, not smoothly sanded, complete with splinters. Just FYI."
2,crappy game,"This game sucks.Its sells alot because he recently died,which is stupid.I would'nt pay 1.00 for the game.I remember the game back in the day."
3,Was he trying to tell the world something?,"This game is the weirdest computer game I have ever seen. It orignally was released when Michael Jackson WAS a bigshot, but it oddly foreshadows today.The whole objective of this game is to have Michael Jackson rescure adoring little boys (unfortunately, I am serious)who squeal ""Michael...Michael"" as if being with him IS the lottery. The graphics are okay considering it is the 1980's, but the connotations of the plot are unbelievable. We are SUPPOSED to pair Michael Jackson up with little boys.I am frightened to realize that there was a time when this plot was actually considered 'normal' and wonder why nobody at Sega headquarters had second thoughts about approviing this."
2,Fun game but i don't support child molesters,I used to love this game before he was caught brown handed in the 4 year old chocolate cookie jar. Typical of Michael to make sure he has a fun game for little boys! Looking at this game now it's so dirty. You have to run around saving little boys oh yeah girls to. Hmm. Michael didn't like girls but i bet he just didn't wanna look suspicious! Good by and good riddance!
2,Dont Buy It,This boat is probably the worst of the Nikko line. This boat goes as fast as a snail on a hot day. My brother got the sea hawk and it goes 10 times faster than this boat. I would recommend the sea racer to kids 8-10 who have had no experience whatsoever with R/C boats because of the lack of speed and stability.
2,don't buy it,"We bought this boat and the Nikko Falcon - father and son boats for my six year old - of course, I got the smaller slower one. The Falcon rocks! With the Sea Racer, you can't tell if the motor is moving it or if the wind is blowing it around. Buy the Falcon, pass on the Sea Racer!"
2,Broke the First Day,"I bought this for my 7 year old grandson. He could hardly wait until it came in the mail. We had chosen it not only because of what it is, but also because of all the high ratings from those using it with children.Well, after about 30 minutes or so of play, the boat apparently got too much water on it and would not go. We have dried it out for a day now and it still won't go. We will try again tomorrow.You can't imagine the disappointment not only of my grandson, but also, of course, of me."
2,Great Director But Not So Great Book,"Big fan of Sweet Smell Of Success and the Alec Guinness comedies but this book lacks the wit of those movies - dull, dry, didactic. If you're interested in directing and storytelling here's three much better books - John Ford by Peter Bogdanovich, Howard Hawks by Joseph McBride, and the classic Hitchcock by Truffaut."
1,Disappointment,This book starts with an outstanding idea: the influence of jazz on Kerouac and (perhaps) the influence of Kerouac on jazz. I was totally disappointed. Author is largely incoherent. The antithesis of Kerouac's clarity. Outstanding idea for another author/another attempt.
2,AHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had to do this show with everyone in 4th grade at my school and I hated doing this. I had the worst song, it was called the work song. If you ever have to do this for a show I feel very bad for you. Take my advice and don`t bore your students or children and make them hear or do this play. We Haz No Jazz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We Haz Rock And Pop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sincerely,Vicki"
2,Iggy&The Stooges-'Search&Destroy-The Detroit Studio Out-Takes' (Cleopatra) 2 1/2 stars,"Out of the fourteen tracks you get here,several of them do sound different from the versions that fans have heard on previous releases.My only complaint is that I wish the sound quality could've been a little better.Most of these cuts sound as if they were mastered off a bootleg recording.But,hey that's okay.Tunes I liked best were ""Raw Power"",""Death Trip"",the Yardbird's ""I'm A Man"",their white trash anthem(sort to speak)""Born In A Trailor"" and Cream's ""I'm So Glad"".For collectors and die hard fans ONLY."
4,Good Collection of Rare stuff,"If you are a Stooge freak, like me, this one collects mostly stuff you've heard before but there is some stuff that is a little different, like a different version of Open Up and Bleed and I believe the Till the End of the Night is a different recording than the one on Year of the Iguana. The guy who commented on the bad recording quality is correct but you haven't heard bad recording quality till you've heard some of the stuff us Stooge-o-philes will listen to for a taste of something else Stoogey. This one is practically pristine compared to some ot thestuff I've payed more for."
1,Terrible Choice...All Smoked Out,I have never made such a terrible choice in choosing a seller. This book smelled horrible. It obviously came from a smoker because it smells like a tobacco factory. I have not began to read this book because I cant stand the smell.
5,Musical Wordsworth!,"Having purchased a few of O'Neal's recordings through the AUM website, and finding this quartet's previous (O'Neals Porch) a high-water mark, I would nevertheless definitely put this one at the head of the class. I am not a jazzophile - Corbett and Giddins probably listen to more music on a lazy Sunday than I do in a month. Nevertheless, I know what I like and I think I could listen to Hamid Drake drum on the skull of my dying mother and still raise a smile. Highly recommended for the sound quality and the inventive playing that never loses the listener and rewards repeated plays."
5,Great Album!,"This is a great album, Dr. John is a legend. ""Indian red"" and ""Basin Street Blues"" are my favorites, but all tracks are excellent. Tracks downloaded quickly, quality seems good."
5,Good Buy,I received this tape in fine shape and in fast time.I would order again from this supplier.
1,Disappointing,"Completely missed the mark on many issues for those suffering from thyroid issues. If I had had the misfortune of being treated by the authors, my Hashimoto's thyroiditis diagnosis would never have been made. I was one of many whose TSH remained low yet I had very elevated TPO antibodies. Fortunately, my endocrinologist understood that not everyone with Hashi's presents with an elevated TSH unlike these authors."
2,"Nothing Really New, May Be Useful for Thyroid Cancer Patients","A decent overview, but nothing you won't find in other similar thyroid disease overview books, like Dr. Glenn Rothfeld's book or Thyroid for Dummies. Sticks to a very by-the-book, TSH-test-is-king, ""if your blood test is normal you must be fine,"" endocrinologist-driven perspective of thyroid disease. Ain is a thyroid cancer doctor, Rosenthal is a thyroid cancer survivor. While their discussions of thyroid cancer are detailed and may very well be helpful to thyroid cancer patients, it's evident that neither has much personal experience or new information to share on topics beyond thyroid cancer. Might be a good addition for a thyroid cancer patient, or someone who wants a basic conventional overview reference book on thyroid disease, but you're going to get pretty much standard American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist/American Thyroid Association official position info, albeit well-organized."
1,Not the Best Info Available for Thyroid patients,"It actually made me angry when I read that there is no reason to use combination t4/t3 therapy (long term). I know that your body is supposed to convert t4 into the active t3 hormone, but the thyroid normally produces about 20% of t3 directly. Why not try to get as close to the ratio of t4-t3 hormone a healthy normal thyroid produces? Some people also seem to have conversion issues. I DO NOT do well on t4 only medication. I tried it for a long time! I have to take Cytomel along with my Synthroid or I feel terrible and my free t3 levels fall way down, while my free t4 levels are at the top. My endocrinologist said that many of his patients seem to need t3. Relying on TSH after beginning treatment is ridiculous, especially if you do use t3, as it suppresses TSH. My doctor adjusts my meds based on symptoms and free t4/free t3 levels. Read Mary Shomon's book instead if you want more unbiased information."
2,Quick to dismiss symptoms....,"The book is well organized, and if I had thryoid cancer, I'm sure I would review it differently. However, it consistently harps that if your TSH is within normal range, you are not hypothyroid. I also states normal is different for each person, but does not tell people how to determine their personal normal. It goes on to say hypothyroidism has many symptoms of other disorders, but there is a huge void of what to do if your life is in fact non-stressful, or diet is already really good, and you don't drink or smoke, but still have symptoms. It feels like although the authors have a high degree of expertise, there is still a huge chunk of people left out of their scenario, people whom they ""poo poo"". There's more to this problem than they care to admit, and it is obvious by the holes that are left in the book itself."
2,Big Pharma [..],"This book is fairly comprehensive. For that I give it the two stars. But, it uses the conventional endocrinologist view that TSH is god and treatment with ""T4 Only"" is the ONLY way to go. WRONG. It does work for SOME people, but not all can convert T4 into T3. If your doctor is of the ""T4 Only"" school, and your free T3 and free T4 and TSH tests all come back ""within normal ranges"", find another doctor who will treat by symptoms. The authors feel that sub clinical hypothyroidism does not exist. They state to ""look for other reasons for your health problems"" if your tests come back normal. This is totally WRONG and the reason we have so many people out there with chronic illnesses. They also trash Armour in this book when it has helped millions of people. Net result: find a doctor who will treat symptoms, not test numbers!"
1,absent purchase,"I would love to be in a position to review this book - but, exactly one month after ordering, it still hasn't arrived. I hope it's worth the wait!"
2,Incomplete and Biased for Hypos,"I don't know what the value of this book would be for a hyperthyroid or thyroid cancer patient, as I am neither. I have autoimmune hypothyroidism. I found this book quite misinformed and biased regarding the treatment/testing of hypothyroidism. [...]"
1,Avoid Buying Any Type Of Drills From Black & Decker,"I have not used this drill that much and the cooling fan broke.You have to buy a new armature to get a new fan. The armature is back ordered and not available from the company. I guess this is a big problem with this model drill. The last 2 Black & Decker drills I owned were junk, this drill was a gift as was the second.I have only purchased 1 Black & Decker for myself and this is why! Avoid anything from Black & Decker unless you want something to throw away in a year."
2,you get what you pay for...,"this thing really smoked a lot when I was mixing thinset with it. I can't knock it for the price, but it won't last very long for what I need it for...you get what you pay for..."
2,Not useful for more than Hammer-Drill...,"I needed a 1/2"" drill for mixing paint and lightweight spackle.And drilling metal and concrete anchors.For the concrete work, it was a reliable and inexpensive choice. But for drilling steel (new bits) or mixing spackle, I wound up (no pun) burning it out.It is not like my father's old Black & Decker 1/2"". The torque alone would rip you a new one. ;)...But for anything else, I'd get something more durable..perhaps a Milwaukee."
5,Songs of the Trail,"Great CD. I bought this one for an Oklahoma Cowboys friend, since I love mine.Judy Loyd"
5,Most played with toy in our house,I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas last year and she loves it. My 4 year old also has a great time playing with it. They have another Ello set and they combine the 2 sets for even more people and animals. This toy keeps them entertained for a long time. I have recommended it to a lot of people.
1,Junk,My daughter likes polly pockets so i thought she would like this but it was just a bunch of junk with lots of pieces.
5,A real gem,"No doubt about it, this album is a real gem. The recording quality may be the best I've encountered for a live recording and the energy level is way up there, building to a real peak with the last two songs--All Along the Watchtower and Dear Mr. Fantasy--which, alone, make this album well worth the price of admission. If you are a Dave Mason fan, Traffic fan or just a fan of good tunes played by a tight band lead by a great guitarist, don't pass up this album."
4,A good introduction to Dark Goddesses,"Starck and Stern (isn't that a wonderful pair of names for this topic?)offer an interesting introduction to Dark Goddess mysteries, an element in women's psychology that is often unacceptable in traditional societies and religions. They provide a chapter by chapter summary of the most powerful of these goddesses--Kali, Lilith, Pele, Hecate--and suggest rituals in which to connect with their energies. The book's weak point is the too-frequent interjections of the authors' personal impressions, which gives the book somewhat of a ""vanity"" feel. But it is overall a very worthwhile reference and workbook for the Dark Goddess mysteries."
3,It's Ok...but VERY challenging,"Hook is an alright game,but it can get on your nerves.It can be very tough.Especially,since there is no options menu.So you can't adjust the difficulty.But,the game is not all that bad.It's pretty much based off the film.The game starts off with Captain Hook kidnapping adult Peter's kids,then Tink comes and tells him that he's Peter Pan,and its up to him to save them.The game is very hard though.If you die,you gotta start the whole level over again.Plus if you get hit only a few times,your dead.Only checkpoints are during boss battles.The music is very good.Also much like the film.The controls are decent too.A button is for attack and B is for flying.C button has no function at all in this game.Overall,Hook is fair.It's worth checking out if you loved the movie,I guess."
4,Small gift,"Items are as pictured. Spoon is well designed to retrieve sugar without bending wrist as one would with a regular spoon. Fingerprints only become an issue with sugar bowl, but with a slight buffing with a napkin they disappear."
5,Frieling Creamer and Sugar Bowl Set,"Please see my review of the Frieling Primo Teapot with Infuser, 34 ounce. Thank you very much for reading my review."
4,"""Tha Bluff"" or a bluff???","I watched the movie and felt uneasy seeing that this was on film because this lifestyle does relate to many ""real ni**as"" who do what they do for survival, and growth but I kept on watching. This is raw and interesting footage, and it does leaves viewers questioning its validity.The Bluff may be a project that is rough for folks from Atlanta but me being from Miami, this film felt real light. After watching it twice over, I did realize that a lot of it was fictional, but it was done extremely well. I hope that there is a superior motive for the release of this film and that Curtis may handle the forthcoming successes with a strategic plan to better himself and his community.I gave the film 5 stars because it relates to me, and my community. I wish the best for Curtis Snow.The Family Is Made (Part 1) (Thuggin In Miami)"
4,It's REAL in the field.,"This DVD is about an average street hustler who lives everyday ""getting it how he lives."" Curtis snow is a go getter. If he ain't got it, he about to go get it. Downsouth lifestyle, family, and customs play a big role in this movie."
5,loved it!,"This movie was gritty and very entertaining. An inside view of life for young black males in ""the hood""! Curtis Snow shows all the typical things that go on in his life and how he's trying to make in this world he lives in."
2,VF4000 RIGID Paper Filter,"I also tried to use this filter in a wet and dry situation. When I tried to vacuum drywall and plaster dust, the particles went right thru the filter and were blown all over the room making even more of a mess. When I used the vacuum to remove water from the basement floor, it worked fine, however, the filter quickly deteriorated and was no longer usable. As a replacement, I purchased an aftermarket filter from www.cleanstream.com which was more expensive, however, it is HEPA rated, and it has a coating to prevent clogging and breakdown. It's also washable so you can get many more uses."
3,good scans but with different software,"I had some difficulty obtaining quality scans with this scanner, and the software wasn't very efficient. Focusing was often inaccurate. However, I tried Viewscan software and the results became very acceptable and fast. 4 slides at 2800 dpi in about 10 minutes. Accurate colors and 8x10 prints are very sharp. I have scanned about 600 slides without a malfunction."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this scanner and while pleased with the some of the scans, the software always seems to be locking up and is quite a nuisance. It is currently in the shop being repaired. If the Nikon IV wasn't so much money, I would have dumped it and went with it."
5,A great Masterclass for beginning writers,"This book is as close to a Fiction Writing Masterclass as you're likely to find without setting foot on a campus. (All that's missing are writing exercises for ""homework"".) There's no fluff here -- just clear, straightforward, easy-to-understand advice for any fiction writer (not just suspense and mystery writers, although that is the primary focus).True, the author doesn't go into very much detail on each topic, but this is forgivable when one considers that if the author did so for each of the eight or so subgenres covered, the book's length would rival that of War and Peace (or at least the latest Harry Potter tome).Definitely worth your money."
1,not pleased,scratched! Not in the condition it said it was. Skipped many times on many songs! I always loved this cd. Someone stole it. But i am not happy!
3,Weakest B52s album,"As a ravenous, long-time fan I finally dug this one out and listened to it again. Its the Bs weakest album for sure, but there are still a few gems here. ""Is That You Modine?"" is a brilliant and whacky tune that reminds me of their earlier stuff. Actually, this is probably among my top 10 Bs songs of all time. ""Good Stuff"" is strong, as is ""Revolution Earth"". The rest are mediocre to okay. Still, this album can be picked up pretty cheaply anymore, so for the couple gems I'd recommend it. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars, but as you can't do halves I gave it 3."
5,Just Plain Fun,"I initally bought ""Good Stuff"" after seeing the video for the title track. A video, might I add, that was totally awesome. (the B-52's frolicking in a room full of soap suds). The first three tracks are worth the price of the CD alone. (Plus, the cover artwork is seriously one of the coolest I've ever seen!) I constantly find myself pulling this cd out of my collection and throwing it in the car for the summer. Everyone enjoys it. Special props go to the songs ""Revolution Earth"" (a beautiful surprise ballad) and ""The World's Greeen Laughter"" (an instrumental dance ditty that will stay in your head for weeks). If you can find them, pick up the maxi singles for ""good stuff"" and ""revolution earth"" which contain really great remixes."
4,One of the B's best albums,"Good stuff contains some of the b's best work to date. Kate's vocals are as vibrant as usual, she really shines on this record."
1,"Caution, ye B-52 fans","I have loved the B52s since 1980. I bought this CD when it came out and listened to it once. I just took it out and listened to it again, before throwing away so I could make good use of the case. There's a reason why Amazon currently lists 150 used starting at 40 cents.I wouldn't even waste my time writing this, but there are some really good reviews on here, and somebody has to tell the truth."
4,very good,Tastes decent and gives you a little bit of energy. My only complaint is that it takes so much to make a strong cup.
4,coca Tea,"Dear Sir's,This tea by the amount was very acceptable.The smaller amounts by weight not as good.Sincerely,David A.Colbertson"
4,amazingly good! amazingly fast!,"i would give 5 if there was ""no sugar added"" but the sweetness is good..."
2,Frank exhibits firm grasp of the obvious,"Dispassionate, thinly-disguised masters thesis filled with 2-dollar words (how many times do you need to use 'hegemony'?) and soft opinions. Like a first book from one of Chomsky's research assistants. Lacks the punch of Frank's work in the BAFFLER. I was disappointed and bored."
2,Well...I thought it was boring,"(I read this book for a class at Yale, ""The Formation of Modern American Culture: 1920 to the Present."") Frank's insights aren't that insightful and his prose is at times prosaic. Nevertheless, Frank makes the reader more aware of the culture of advertising that has enveloped us and gives us the history of how this has occurred, focusing on the 50's and 60's. He also uses the word ""psychedelic"" quite frequently, which may or may not amuse you. (It amused me!)"
1,The Essence Of Awful,"Thomas Frank has been endowed with a talent for writing tortured prose which is uniquely inelegant, the Washington Post should really recruit him, he could be much more effective at crippling the language there. Instead he makes do with whatever scraps of intellect he possess to write articles in obscure magazines one stumbles over occasionally in second hand bookstores, and this wretchedness. Thomas Frank is no more equipped to comment on the Sixties then Michael Crichton would be on Bertrand Russel."
4,good product,"got the idea from my wife's brother. this was a Christmas present and once open, was used by a number of people around the room. everyone thought it was wonderful and felt great after just a few minutes. almost feels like it shakes the soreness out of you. my wife is going to physical therapy for her back and thought this might help. she says it feels great afterwards. hope it cuts down on those visits."
5,Understanding the oligarchs,This is a comprehensive and compelling exAmination of a fascinating phenomenon in Russia in the 1990's. The author's access to sources and ability to piece together the labyrinth of Russian political and business life is amazing and also a darn good read. This was a unique period in Russia and this book is one of a kind. I very much appreciate the extent of investigative journalism that went into producing the profiles as well as the clear explanations about how these men once attained such political power under Yeltsin.
4,Read This First,"This book is the best starting point for a novice's study of modern Russia. While much of the information is now dated, it provides a thorough description of the new Russian state following the fall of communism in the 1990s. The schemes and intrigues are explained in detailed but understandable terms. As a warning to those seeking a comprehensive overview of Russia ""today,"" this book centers on the Yeltsin era, with Putin arriving only in the final pages. Following the book's 2002 publication, a whole new chapter begins in Russia. Read this book as the background for current works discussing what is unfolding there now."
4,A good thumbnail sketch of the oligarchic interregnum,"Daniel Hoffman of the Washington Post has written a good introduction to the interregnum between the reign of the Commununist Party of the USSR and the Presidency of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. When Communism and the Russian legal system collapsed, the boldest and brashest quickly amassed fortunes in rather unusual circumstances.Hoffmann's account is a good introduction to these times and to the ""oligarchs"" who shaped these times. His book is by no means a work of investigative reporting, being liberally littered with phrases along the lines of ""we'll never know the whole story"", ""there must have been more going on, but there are no authorative sources,"" ""we can only surmise that much of the episode is opaque."" Nor do I understand why Hoffman considers mayor Luzhkov of Moscow, Moscow's answer to Richard Joseph Daley of Chicago, an ""oligarch.""All the same, this is a well-written and entertaining book about an extraordinary time."
2,An almost good book for under 2's,"I first bought 'Max's Starry Night' for my then 24mos. old son. As an African American, I loved that the ""hero"" is a little brown boy. The story was meaningful (for a toddler) with great, simple adjectives just right for that age. We both love that book and read it frequently.I bought 'Max' with the same expectations. I was so bored with 'Max' and my son wasn't much more impressed. It is overly simplistic with pop-ups that are untinteresting and flimsy. I find that all of Mr. Wilson-Max's pop-up books tear very easily (we have four of his pop-ups). I therefore really can't recommend this book. Instead, try 'Max's Starry Night' or if you have child that likes trains or space (as my 2yo does) try ""Big Silver Space Shuttle"" or ""Big Blue Engine""."
3,"Perfect product, WRONG color in photo!","The plates are exactly what i was looking for, ALMOST! Needed to cover 2 new access holes drilled in my boat (inside a compartment). The plates certainly look white (off white) in the photo. When I received mine, they are actually BLACK. Dark solid black! The item # and product descriptions match, but the color is opposite. Since I have an all white boat, this doesn't work for me. I contacted the seller a couple of days ago, but have not heard back. Hopefully they will exchange or refund. Bought from a third party through Amazon."
1,Don't buy it.,"The only good song on the disc is Godstar 94.Skip it. If you're a Psychic TV fan, buy an album, don't waste your hard earned cash on this turkey."
4,A surefire benchmark,"The film looks real. Actors don't wear designer costumes, there are no exquisite locations but what it does have is ingenuity and a sense of realm. The movie does not focus on a couple of 'brand ambassadors' but does justice to characters and all the actors have done a commendable job in keeping it real. The characterization is superb. The dialogues are witty and have a subtle Indian flavour in them. It also has a hint of dark sense of humour. The opening scene is funny but is inconspicuously and heavily sarcastic which is excellent dark comedy material. You will see many of those in the movie.Brilliant piece of Cinema...Go watch it!!!!"
2,Too much. I have had enough.,"This is the third book by Carol Berg that I have read. The first was Transformation the second was Revelation and the third was Restoration. Enough !! The first two books were exellent but the theme gets repeatative. I couldn't get farther than the first hundred pages for book number three. The plot is convoluted but I could kind of guess what was coming next. More hard spots for the hero and then the ultimate sacrifice. I have seen that before in book number two and one. I do not recommend this book. You need to know about the first two books to get full value for the third book, but after the first two you get bored reading the same basic plot. I really do recommend book one and two since Carol Berg is an original writer who breaks new ground in the science fiction genre. The hero Seyonne is a new type. A broken down hero who finds the courage to rise again. However enough is enough !"
5,"Please, Carol, write more books!","From the first time I picked up Carol's first book I fell in love. This world she created was so unusual and unique, and her main character, Seyonne had so many trials he went through and faced that I couldn't help myself and found it impossible to put down. As soon as the next book came out, I grabbed it. Her intricate descriptions, and well described sideline characters helped to enrich the story. So often these days authors spend little time describing all the rest of the characters that help make the story. Her plot was well designed and thought out and in no way glossed over with a: it happened off camera type of scenario, where you're never quite sure how or why things came to a conclusion that they did -- which you so often see with unimaginative writings. She is a great writer and I cannot wait to see what else is forthcoming from her pen and paper!"
2,Very disappointing,I really enjoyed the 1st book in the series but the 2nd and this the 3rd seem overly wordy and go off in directions that I didn't find enjoyable to read. I don't know if the author is getting paid by the word but there were a lot of times that paragraphs seemed too long and didn't really provide any details to move the story along. I got frustrated and ended up skipping through quite a few sections and got to the point that the story and main characters had changed so much that I almost lost the will to finish the book - something that almost never happens to me. So all in all I was really disappointed in the conclusion of a series that had so much promise to start.
3,Enjoyed it,Frustrating to read at times. The story moved in too many directions often with many slow parts especially the beginning. Despite that it was a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy and did enjoy it.
5,The Complete Book of Canning,"This book is what I refer to as my ""bible"" for canning. Anything you ever wanted to know about canning is in this book, and it's written in easy to understand language. I highly recomend that anyone who has the urge to fill their jars with nature's bounty read this book first."
4,Skate-on!,"If you're one of those people who can't seem to keep balance on a skateboard no matter hard they try, this might be your chance to see what it's like. Of course, the only exercise you'll get will have more to do with carpal tunnel syntrome than scrapes on the sidewalk, but it's an appealing ride.Unless you learn the more advanced tricks, you'll most likely be stuck doing elementary manoeuvers, and that can lose interest after a while. It's best to put a bit more effort into your play.My main problem was that the software requires you drop in a disk every time you play. I've tried to install the software on my computer, with no success. It's a problem if you want to back up your data as you're playing - just when I have spare time.Still, the software is not buggy, and the action is smoth."
4,Lots of Fun,"I had played some of the older versions of Tony Hawk and this one is really great. Lots of fun to just tool around the very large and elaborate locations. A good way to kill some time and have some fun, or do something relaxing after a hard day."
1,Mad,I did not receive the product that I ordered. Instead I received a used Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 for Playstation.I am still trying to get in contact with the seller but no luck. Very disapponted.
5,Solid release from the south with some great cameos,"This is a solid album. Great, laid back, thuggin' beats and lyrics on point. Devin the Dude, Daz Dillinger, and the Outlawz all make guest appearances on the album making it even that much better. Cop this piece."
2,IMPOSSIBLE!!,"The Immortal is soooo hard.There are traps EVERYWHERE in this game.It could be flying arrows that will instantly kill you...holes that you fall into...giant worms eating you...or other crazy ways to end one of your two continues.Whenever you fight an enemy,it's very hard to control.You'll be very lucky if you survive.Plus as I just mentioned...you only have a couple continues.Thats it.Then it's game over.So why do I give it a two and not a one??? Because,this game is still pretty decent.It's got nice graphics.Especially for an old Genesis game,the storyline seems cool and it's got some gore...but oh my lord.The game is tough.On the upside,there is a password system though,but the hard difficulty is what really kills this game.So buy it....if your up to one HELL of a challenge."
3,"The Card is great, but what's up with Guillemot","This card is great. For the price you can't be it. Granted it isn't a Dolby 5.1 card, but for everyday multimedia you cannot get a better card for the money.Supports 4 speakers and all the usual inputs, i.e. Mic & Gameport.But, there is one catch. Burn a copy of the cd before you do anything. Because God forbid you do something stupid like step on it. After calling tech support and hitting pretty much every voicemail box in Canda, realizing aparently the people a Guillemot don't enjoy clearing out their messages, and then trying email...etc.etc.Seriously, tech support even during business hours leads to full voicemail boxes. Emails don't get returned and they don't post the drivers for this card on the site. Its been the accepted (well not really, but) 4-6 weeks and I don't see a replacement CD anywhere.So make sure you know little tricks like driverguide.com because that is the only place you will find Maxi Muse drivers."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I LIKE BLACK AND DECKER PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. LASTED ONLY A FEW MONTHS. CHARGE LASTS A SHORT TIME IF IT CHARGES AT ALL."
4,Great Handheld Elect Screwdriver,"Can't beat the price for this cordless screwdriver. Great for lite duty work around the house.Only con is I have had issues with the bit staying in. I lost 2 bits just walking around. So would like to see either a stronger magnetic hold or another method to keep the bit in place.Other than that, I'm loving this for lite duty work."
1,It broke on the first day of use,"I got this for my son who works as a lot attendant at a car dealership. He has to install license plates on new cars. He took it to work and as he was putting on his fifth plate it started making a grinding noise internally and stopped working. I had thrown out the receipt (my own fault), so we just wrote it off. We certainly won't be buying another one though."
4,great for small jobs,"This little cordless screwdriver comes in handy for many jobs around the house. It doesn't have the strength for large jobs, but on even the biggest jobs its ability to get into tight corners is useful. As for the length of charge: I misplaced mine while moving and left it in a cold storage unit unplugged for six months. It still had a useable charge after rescue from the bottom of a box."
5,great for the average do-it-yourselfer,"I got this for my spouse and he loved it. Its easy to use, runs as long as he needs for the minor projects and repairs he does. If you are a professional who'd use a tool like this, it won't last nearly as long as you'll need. The target audience should be the average John or Jane who really just wants to make the few times a screwdriver is needed a month less work so things get fixed in a timely fashion."
1,not acceptable,We had one of these screwdrivers for 5 years. It worked wonderfully while we were putting a house together. It worked hard every day. Last month a gear broke and because it had been so good we ordered an exact replacement. The new screwdriver broke in the same spot as the old one in the first powered use. The gears are plastic and just cannot hold up. The first tool might have been unusually good; but we don't want to experiment with a third.
2,not as pictured,I did not recieve the scredriver that was pictured. I already have one like the one sent to me....
2,Missing Piece,Seems like a fine tool--I just can't use it.I waited 2 weeks for it to arrive only to find the bit was missing from the package. Now I get to wait another 7-10 days for it to arrive.I would have been better off buying this at a hardware store.
2,Too weak and too big for small spaces,"This screwdriver is too weak for doing anything serious. It's good for a couple of screws here and there, but try to do anything like putting a piece of Ikea furniture together and it runs out of batteries before getting done and it's not powerful enough to drive some of the screws. I've had it in its charging cradle hung up on the wall and the battery degarded quite quickly as well.This would be forgivable if this tool was one of the kind that bends so it can get into small spaces, but it doesn't even do that.Was not very happy with this tool. The best feature was the overtorque protection."
4,Proper Power,"I purchaced this screw driver for small projects. Jobs that I didn't want to strip the screw or ""over-drive"" the screw. It is perfect for that use.The handle is comfortable and it holds a charge a good long time. The downside is the driver does not come with a case like the old Black and Decker drivers did and doesn't come with exchangeable batteries. You can ""replace"" the battery but you can't have a backup battery charged up and waiting.Overall a very good product for fair price."
3,"Useful, sort of.","I used to use a B&D cordless screwdriver, but gave it away when I found it often took as long, or longer to use this tool than using a manual screwdriver. Sure, it's faster when you have a LOT of screws or very long screws, but a cordless drill is faster still, and has the advantage of variable speed and more power. Using this screwdriver to drive long wood screws is an excercise in patience as you watch it sloooowly drive the screw in and then quit halfway as it runs out of power.Cordless screwdrivers are cheaper than drills, true, but overall I think the classic 7.2volt Makita cordless drill is just about as compact, much more versatile, much more powerful, lasts much longer and will drive a lot more screws on a charge."
1,Don't buy - you've been warned,"I've bought B&D electric screwdrivers for years, and they've been great. I got two of these - one did not work out of the package, the other lasted 5 months. B&D says I have to try and find a local service center to try and get warranted. This is a waste, especially when I bought these online, and what's with the terrible quality??!!!"
4,Black & Decker Electric Screwdriver,"This is a wonderful and reasonably priced tool for home and hobby projects. It is easy to use, has adequate power for light duty household tasks and should last for years as long as the user does not expect to use it for heavy duty jobs. The locking feature allows the user to put more torque on the tool for tightening beyond the capacity of the tool's batttery and motor. Care must be taken however, to avoid applying too much torque in manual locked mode, as the gears inside the head are plastic and might be stripped if the tool is used too aggressively. Otherwise, the tool is of good quality."
2,WEAK,I thought this unit was the replacement for my BK Power Driver. NOT ! ! ! Don't waste your money on this.
2,Does not keep tea any warmer than a regular ceramic teapot,"This tea maker is good looking and convenient, but I was disappointed that it doesn't keep tea warm despite the claim that it will do that."
3,Spout drips and metal screen is not uniform.,"Reviews that say the spout drips are accurate. Mine makes one drip after each pour. Also the metal screen that holds the tea leaves is stretched in some places making some of the holes in the screen larger than the rest. This results in more sediment getting through to your tea. Quality is not that great for such a high price. Also, keep in mind that the bottom gets very hot so it must not be double-walled on the bottom. I might have to live with it."
4,It was OK,It took me quite some time to finish this book. I normally get through one in a couple days but not this one. Charles Boynton has loved Marguerite all of his life. Because of his unrequited love he has turned to writing poetry with a pseudonym of B. C. Rose. He poses as the Midnight Bandit to attract his love by writing love poems to her. Her husband has died and she is labeled the Poison Widow incorrectly. It is quite a tale with the two of them keeping secrets from each other but love finally prevails. There are some dangerous twists and turns throughout the book to keep it interesting though. It was a good enough book but not one to keep me up late reading. I will be reading A Lover's Kiss next as it is the next one in the trilogy. The Midnight Bandit appears in this next book.
4,A charming tale of a passionate lover and his prey.,"Charles Boynton has loved Marguerite Lennox for years, and she has not given him a bit of encouragement. His unrequited passion has driven him to write poetry that has been received avidly by the ladies of the community. Marguerite has endured a repressive, loveless marriage for several years, and even her husband's death does not free her. People suspect that she did away with her husband herself, thus gaining her the nickname of the Poison Widow. The local women are titillated by the Midnight Bandit, a man who recites poetry as he steals. To win Marguerite over, Charles writes to her as the Midnight Bandit. But her dark past is connected with Montagu Renny who is blackmailing her. She feels that she must hide her dark past at all costs."
4,Nelson returns to his guitar roots.,"After almost two decades of making some of the most interesting electronic music of our time, Nelson here returns to his first love, the guitar. No words, just music, and what music it is. If you are impressed with Beck, Clapton and Eddie Van Halen, then take this disc for a spin. What Nelson does with his guitar isn't so much play it and take it on trips into his incredibly creative mind. Perhaps the single most overlooked rock artist of the 80s. END"
4,be bop deluxe is still his best work,"I loved bill nelson for many years . I had the opportunity to meet him years ago, a down to earth great guy! but after be bop"
3,Rhythm and funky,"The album is OK with rhythms alternating. If you're looking for a smooth jazz album, check out Urban Knights 4."
3,Some of the filters listed here are actually GENERIC filters,"One of the sellers of the Genuine Ridgid VF5000 filter (Total Vac) is actually selling both the GENUINE and the GENERIC versions of the filter. Unfortunately, both versions show up under the GENUINE part. To their credit they do mention in small print that it is generic but when Amazon sends you your confirmation of the sale they make no mention of it being generic so you think you are going to receive the real thing. The generic part should be removed from being sold under the genuine part and should receive its own listing."
4,Great Filter,I was most really impressed with this filter from Rigid. I purchased this filter to clean up drywall dust. It completed the task exceptionally well.
4,Another generic filter,"Based on another review here, I wasn't surprised to receive a generic filter. In my case, it was a Green Klean Brand[..]and looked very well made, with a 1 micron rating. If it truly is 1 micron and will last, then I won't mind that it's a generic except for the misleading descriptions here on Amazon. I would have given 5 stars if Amazon or the marketplace seller had disclosed it as a Green Klean filter."
1,Rigid Nonexistent Customer Support,"Called Rigid to get a simple answer concerning their Fine Dust Filter for a Rigid shop vac and waited on the line for a total of over 30 minutes and was transferred to 4 different departments. After having waited this long period, the last department came in with a recording saying the appropriate individual was on another line with a customer and that I should leave a voice message and they would get back to me -- when and on which day I'm not sure. I believe this to be a good product, however, they seem to have nearly nonexistent customer support. UPDATE: It's been hours later and still no return call from Rigid. I will now buy generic Fine Dust Filters which I have located from another source at close to only half the price of Rigid's filters and have been told that they may very well have been made by the same manufacturer that Rigid uses for theirs."
1,Terrible Pinball games!,"This set of pinball games is terrible. The flippers are sluggish, the graphics are dark and hard to see. The 3D effect of the tables is poor, and makes play confusing. The box claims 27 tables, but there are not 27 DIFFERENT tables - there seem to be about 15 different tables, and the rest are just duplicate tables on another CD. If you like the graphics and feel and play of the Space Cadet pinball table that comes with Windows, don't buy this. It's not even close."
1,Straight ripoff!! I'd rate this a -10 !!!,"I can only agree with the other negative reviews. This ""game"" is a complete waste of time and money. Most ""games"" in this collection either wouldn't install or would freeze my system (and I'm not running junk here). I finally got ""Pinball 10"" to run but it is very sluggish. The support is a joke. I've expressed my displeasure but Encore has not gotten back with me. Likewise (as Lafayette Gamer), Encore will not have a repeat customer here."
3,An interesting collection.,"This collection is recommended only for true pinball nuts and people experienced in tweaking their computers to get games running. This collection is from various different makers, and thus each set of games installs differently. Most run okay in Windows, but some seem to prefer DOS. My least favorites of the bunch are from 21st Century. They have 2D scrolling tables, which make for disorienting gameplay.However, there are som real gems here too. The ten or so tables from Redoubt Software are as good as anything I've seen lately, and are in full 3D. It's well worth the money just to be able to try the tables from Redoubt. Great sound effects and even video clips abound.Redoubt is also responsible for the excellent ""Williams Pinball Classics"", which was just recently released."
1,don't bother with win XP,"I am agreeing with the others. I am running Windows XP, and was only able to get The Tomb up and running. And even it was a little buggy and froze my machine. Also, the physics were a bit suspect. If you can still easily run DOS, then this package may be worthwhile. If you are running XP....forget about it."
1,a major disappointment,"The other 1-star reviews are right on the mark. I have a top-of-the-line computer (1.2 GHz cpu, 256 M ram, etc) and some of these games, each with its own installation program, had trouble installing and running. Some froze up my machine to the point I had to power cycle. The games seem to be a collection of several independently-developed pinball games from different companies, thrown together on a set of 3 or 4 CDs, each with different setup routines and user interfaces. Get one game figured out and you have no assurance that you'll know how to run the next one (assuming it will run!). Only one of the games, ""Creep Night"" by Sierra, was worth keeping on my machine, but even it isn't up to their usual standard of quality in terms of graphics and game play, and it also has locked up my machine once or twice. If you see this product in the store, don't be fooled by the fancy box! After 30 minutes I wished I had my money back."
1,Game [stinks]!,"The only reason a star appears with this is because I could not post my review without one! I am so happy I read the reviews below. I already bought the game package, but for a long time, I thought I had to get rid of my nice little Toshiba laptop!!! I thought my computer was to blame for the non-performance of this stupid game package. And yet, Creep Night, Thrillride and the Sims were running fine... I would feel a surge of excitement if the Tomb would work for me for five seconds. I finally realized it was better to NOT continue to force my computer to run these games. I mean, how many times do you have to crash before you know it's not worth it?..."
1,Only Able To Enjoy Two Games,"I was only able to install and run two games from this set. I really enjoy The Web, and Creep Night, although has ""cartoonish"" graphics is highly enjoyable...but I have no idea what the other games included in this set are like because they froze my computer up and wouldn't install. Instead of wasting your money, buy Creep Night and The Web individually...sometimes quality is better than quanity."
1,Stopped working,"This Fork Thermometer would have been great if it had lasted more than 3 usages. No way to notify the manufacturer to find out ""why"" the fork quit working. It's still useful as a meat fork, but not as a thermometer. Very disappointing and a bit expensive to be used only as a fork.!"
5,"Anne Briggs, THE VOICE OF THE QUEEN OF ELFIN",Essential in every way. If you don't like this or own it there is no hope for you at all! The finest singer ever!
5,Love this author,I am collecting all of Edward Hays books. I love the way he teaches me in lay-mens terms but with a deeper meaning the Christan walk.
3,Expensive Sandpaper,There are only 5 sheets of sandpaper in this package. I guess we pay for the convenience of having sandpaper cut to size so it fits the mouse sander
2,Less than satisfied,"I was so excited about my Black&Decker Mouse. I thought I'd be able to tackle my difficult sanding jobs. I thought it would do more than it does, and I'm dissapointed that there's only 3 grades of sandpaper. It was billed as a sander and it's more of a fine tuner or a polisher/scrubber. It doesn't sand very well. They need a wider range of grit for a lesser cost, such as 50 grit. I feel like I was ripped off. It's a glorified polisher that can get into the nooks."
4,My little buddy...........the mouse,"I use my B&D; mouse for lots of fairly rugged work on my boat. It is so ergonomically friendly - fits the hand comfortably. Teak trim, fiberglass prep, prepping paint projects all go well with my mouse. There's a rugged attachment that really lets you reach out further from the tip of the machine to get into narrow/hard to reach spots. Too, I've used it for the spindles and cap rail on my house deck. I have a larger orbital, but the mouse is the one I reach for unless the job is just too big. It is also reasonably quiet.You will enjoy using the mouse."
5,General Chaos,"Chaos wreaks havoc on the screen as the two armies battle it out. Gameplay is awesome as you're army blows the enemies heads off. You can command up to five men but two can also be selected if you are the commando type. This is a definite game to put on your ""get"" list. That is if you still have a sega."
4,The British John Fahey?,"Just as John Fahey begat the more widely-known Leo Kottke who proceeded to influence yet even more players, guitarist Davy Graham did the same for the British music scene of the mid to late 60's. Most American listeners were probably first exposed to Graham's music when Paul Simon covered his most well-known composition, ""Anji"" on the ""Sounds Of Silence"" album. Mixing jazz, folk, blues and Eastern-style open tunings,you could say Graham was a ""world music"" pioneer, setting the stage for future breakthroughs like the Beatles' ""Norwegian Wood"" and Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"". This compilation gives you a good overview of Davy Graham's unique talents; and the remastering is excellent. Recommended for guitar afficiandos."
2,"Low price, quality to match","I received this product for free as part of a camera promotion. I wouldn't dream of using it for my camera, but I use it to hold my off-camera flash, and it works fine for that, though the head is poorly-built and wearing out quickly. I expect before long I'll have to replace the head because it will no longer lock (I'll probably just get a new tripod like this).If you want to support a very light point and shoot camera occasionally, this might be okay. If you want to support any type of single-lens reflex (interchangeable-lens) camera, or even to use a heavier point and shoot, I'd get a better tripod. The Velbon Maxi tripods or the Bogen 3001 would be much more satisfactory (and cost more, of course)."
4,OK,"Its lightweight, cheap. You have to develop the habit of not turning the camera when mounted as it unscrews it from the tripod."
5,It's amazing,"It's much more than I expected. Strong but light, very helpful. I used this tripod with my Handycam and with my Casio Exlim with no problem at all."
4,Great Value for the Price,"Pleasantly surprised by the quality and functionality, particularly by the removable camera mount. Although a light-weight, the tripod is solid and easy to use."
4,"simple, economical, does the job",I think this is a great tripod for the money. Its very basic and easy to use and store. Not for the professional photographer but for the novice or photography as a hobby its great.
3,regular,"es bueno para uso familiar pero en uso extremo no tiene muy buen desempeño, es un poco delicado"
3,Functional but poor materials,"I was very disappointed to discover that, approximately 5 min after removing the tripod from the box, the adjustment screw for the 360 degree rotation broke off in my hand. All the screws are made of a weak plastic that cannot be over tightened lest they break off. If you don't know this ahead of time you would never know because it is extremely difficult to judge the delicate balance between being tight enough to keep the stage securely in place and yet not too tight that the plastic screws will fail. However, I do believe this to be a question of materials quality and if you're looking to avoid these problems you should consider a more expensive model. For the relatively cheap price, it's not bad value. It's just too bad since I bought it as a gift for my fiancee and it was broken before I even was able to present it."
3,"Cheap, yet stable tripod","If you are an avid photographer and make lot of outdoor trips for photography and need a tripod, this is NOT the right one for you. Buy an expensive one.However, if you are an amateur in photography or pursue photography as a hobby, and are looking for a reasonably priced tripod for occasional use, this will work just fine.Features, I liked:- Expandable length with multiple settings.- Stable, unless put on really uneven surfaces like rocks etc.- Lightweight to carry.- Small size fits in a backpack or small bag.- Three way movement is pretty smooth.- One click easy removal of camera with the screw-in base from the stand.- Price is unbeatable for this quality.In short, you get what you pay for...actually more than that. In case, if you but it, I recommend to buySlik Tripod Carrying Case - Medium- 25"" X 4.25"" with Adjustable Carry Strap, Outside Pocket & I.D. Pocket."
4,Very stable Tripod,"A very stable tripod for the dollar. Nice adjustable tripod to even some very unusal positions! A little on the bulky side for long day trips, like to the zoo. Would actually go for the monopod, lighter, more compact, you just need a little balance control. Overall great product for short walking tours. Tiring to lug around with other camera equipement. But great value for the price.update: after several outings using tripod must report that it is heavy and akward to lug around. A couple of trips to the zoo carring also a camera bag with slr camera. It is very stable and of good quality but for travel or for trips with alot of movement I suggest a small light weight monopod."
4,good tripod,it is a good tripod for my cameras except the vivicam 20 camera but other wise it does fine
4,Great inexpensive tripod,For the price you cant beat it. the quick release snaps on the legs are super easy and solid. its lightweight and the rotating head is super steady.
3,Looking for light weight?,"then go for it. This is not sturdy. In my opinion , this one is not good for SLR with big zoom lens"
5,Love it!,"So lightweight, I use it all the time and sometimes forget I'm carrying my cell phone around my waist. Stylish too."
2,jumbo - not so much,disappointed - not jumbo - but should have reaaly looked at the size dimensions - back it went
3,Historically Interesting,"My copy of the book had Billy Connelly on the front cover ... which is a shame , as a pic. of the bard himself would've been more appropriate . As to the poems ... well they are pretty awful ! Little wonder an inn-keeper threw peas at the man to rid him , lucky that turnips weren't on the menu . The poems do have an interesting look at life in the 1800's . This is real life , the everyday mishaps and disasters , the loves and losses , of the "" ordinary "" folk . And as such , some poems are deeply moving by their content . Worth reading ... but only once , in an average life-time !"
2,Dripping with drivel,"I bought this book thinking it would offer some smart guidelines for building a stylish wardrobe that also reflects one's personality, and that it might dish its advice in a tone that is fun to read. Wrong on both counts. It was more along the lines of ""You should so totally buy a beautiful, wonderful dress, maybe even a COLUMN dress, for that wedding you have to attend. But don't ruin it with icky shoes!"" As far as the ""fashion personalities"" they listed, I didn't find myself in any category. Rather, I know what category I'm in, and they didn't think to list it. The only thing I liked about the book were the letters written by people with fashion crises--first date ever, etc, included at the beginnings of the chapters. Otherwise, the annoyingly chirpy generalizations that filled this book were nothing I couldn't get in any fashion mag for much less money."
3,Not Again!,"I suppose it was unrealistic of me to expect any new insights or AHA! moments while reading this book...but the disappointment was especially bitter when I realized that 99 percent of everything I read I had read before. Learning to define my fashion style as ""classic"" or ""preppy"" really didn't do it for me, and my closets are already weeded, thank you very much. A waste...(waist?) of money."
1,Annoying and confusing,"This is just another in a long line of ""fashion"" books I've checked out from the library that disappoint. The advice is, from my experience, only good for skinny folks. I think this book would appeal to anyone who's very thin, very rich (I winced every time they recommended ""Hermes"" or ""Chanel."" And every time they recommended tossing those pointy-toed shoes if round-toes are in ""this year"" and never to be caught dead with ""last year's bag."" Seriously?), and pretty much already knows how to put together an outfit. But then again, does that person really need a book on fashion?"
2,look further,"There are some fun exercises in this manual, but by the main they are labored. There's plenty of books out there in this field; I suggest you look further."
3,"Not bad, but think before you buy","For most ordinary household uses, this is a fine drill. It has good power and torque. However, I did have a minor problem.I found the keyless chuck had difficulties grasping round drill bits. I had tremendous difficulties using a hole saw with this drill. Other round drill bits, such as one used to drill regular holes worked OK, but I still had problems getting the chuck tight enough (it seemed the bigger the bit, the more difficult I had). To be honest, I am not sure if the problem is with the product line or my drill only..."
3,Vivian Blaine,"I'm glad to see this album released on cd. Vivian Blaine is most known for her spunky performance as Miss Adelaide which she did on broadway and the film. After that Vivian recorded this good album of songs from the musicals Pal Joey and Annie with a Gun. Glenn Osser arranges Pal Joey and Hal Mooney does the Annie with a Gun side. I was already familiar with Glenn's past arrangements like his work on The Classic Della. I wasn't surprised by his work here but Hal Mooney's is just as good. The bouncy numbers here are the best like That Terrific Rainbow, There's No Business like Show Business, and Zip which is kind of weird for her to sing with its reference to Marlon Brando. There are string like ballads which show Vivian's smooth vocals as well. Vivian had the type of voice which you don't see too much on today's broadway brassy and wonderful."
1,Very disapointing quality,"The quality of this coffee maker does not match the price. The handle fell off of my first carafe. Fortunately that was under warranty. I received the replacement carafe and in less than 5 months later, the handle fell off of that carafe also. Because it is not under warranty, a replacement carafe is about $65.00.Although I have been very pleased with other Krups coffee makers and other Krups appliances, this one was a big disappointment."
5,Anyone who does not like this album is lame!,"I must admit that even though I rated this album at 5 stars, at first I was skeptical. However, once I gave it a chance I realized that most of the songs are extremely well written and played. In ""Attack!!"" Yngwie returns to his better known style of neo-classical metal, instead of the sell-out prog-rock album known as ""War to End All Wars"" and the lame attempt to create thrash metal songs in the album ""Alchemy"". In other words, those who are into Yngwie's old style of music will not be disappointed, a great album from beginning to end!"
2,A Bit Disappointing,"I'm a huge Malmsteen fan. He's the reason I got into guitar when I was 12 and why I play the way I do. I love his albums and I heard ""Baroque & Roll"" on the G3 tour so I got this album when it was released. My verdict? It's one the worst Malmsteen albums. Dougie White was a poor choice for a singer and Malmsteen sounds so sloppy on this record.. The album sounds like Malmsteen was uninspired and just wrote and recorded them in a day. There's no inspiration, no emotion, nothing. I mean, when it from this to ""Unleash the Fury"", I was like what happened? ""UtF"" was great and his new one, ""Perpetual Flame"", is his best in years. Sure, it has all the speed and neo-classical flavor of Malmsteen but it's too long of an album and where's the instrumentals? There's only 2 real instrumentals (not counting ""Air"")? Please. ""Attack!!"" is one of those albums I quickly forgot about and it's one of the only Malmsteen albums that is collecting dust, never to be heard again."
4,Great novel,"Great novel- the type you would read over and over again. Balzac is a fantastic writer, and he truly captured the feeling of the era. You really empathize with the characters."
4,Pere Goriot,"I read this for my book club. We like to read historical fiction and it is often hard to find. All in all we loved it. It really personalized the class struggles and highlighted the superficial clamoring of the bourgeoisie to maintain or better their station at all cost. It felt like it was time of lost community where everyone was trying to get ahead and the characters were all pretty insufferable, but in a way that made it a lovely piece of tragedy."
5,A Soft Spot in My Heart,"High Spirits was the first Broadway Show I ever saw (aged 13). I absolutely loved it (how can you not love Bea Lillie riding a bicycle throughout her opening number, or Tammy Grimes flying through the air accompanied by other flying, singing ghosts). Shortly afterwards I bought the cast album, which I enjoyed listening to for years (I loved ""Home Sweet Heaven,"" ""Talking to You,"" and ""Something Is Coming to Tea,"" among others). Unfortunately, I lost the record about 20 years ago. If only someone would release this gem of a cast recording again at a reasonable price, I would snap it up immediately!!!"
1,What'a in the bundle?,"I see the prices for the various items, but I don't see what the items are.What is in the bundle?"
3,Ok but knowledge is known to military firearms instructors,"I enjoyed the video but found most of the knowledge discussed to be information readily available in most military manuals. As a former Marine and Army firearms trainer and technician I found it a good review but not really relaying any ""new knowledge."" With that said I do recommend it.I purchased my copy from Paladin Press and was disappointed as it and all their other videos on this subject were recorded at super long play and the grainyness made it difficult to really see all that was presented. There really is no excuse to charge Standard Play rates for Super Long Play videos."
2,"Looks good, doesn't do the trick.",This little pitcher is far too short to actually work as a frothing pitcher. I have burned myself multiple times with it!
2,Frieling Pitcher Way Too Small,"I should have paid more attention to the description. For me, this is way to small for a medium latte. At only 10 oz you can only put in about 1/2 cup of milk (because once you start frothing, the cup fills up quickly. If that's all the milk you need, enjoy, it is a nice quality pitcher."
5,VERY IMPRESSED!!!,I gotta say that this is by far the best mixtape of southern crunk music I have ever heard. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes that bounce music.
4,Storytelling for Writers,"Storytellers who also strive to be writers will do well to read this book. It helps you to decide what stories you might want to write, and how to take your audience, the reader, into consideration in making the selection. From character creation to structure planning, this is a basic guide to presenting stories that will entertain. It is also a very suitable primer for beginning fiction writers of any genre."
3,"So, who ARE ya gonna call?","I don't know if I remember this game well enough to give an accurate review, but here goes:This is another basic side-scroller where ya go around and eliminate enemies. I think the game takes place entirely in Dana Barett's apartment complex, and you have to keep watching out for the Stay-Puffed Marshmellow Man (person, but he was called a man) who, uh. . . I think he either grabs you or shoots lasers from his eyes. . . either way, he attacks through windows from the outside. The ghostbusters have heads that are almost as big as their toony bodies, which looks pretty hilarious in my opinion."
3,"Not Good, Not Bad","It's sandpaper, it's extra fine. Just go to Lowe's or Home Depot, you'll find cheaper stuff there, that'll do the job just as good if not better..."
4,too bad it has one of the worst covers i've seen,"monastery wasn't a revolutionary book, but it was reasonably well written and had characters I could involve myself with even on a second or third read over time.The sequel doesn't move quite as nicely as the first one did for me, but overall it was a damn good read.Its a shame that the cover artwork makes it look like a campy kids book which it is not. It might have had a chance if they just continued with the same style artwork as monastery."
2,"This is a Great DVD , but the Shipping and Handling cost was too High !","This DVD is really GOOD , but the shipping and handling cost was too Damn HIGH !!! When I was ordering this DVD at the time , they wasn't letting me know the cost for shipping and handling . If I knew I was gonna be paying more than $ 30.00 for shipping and handling I would've never order this DVD in the first place !"
1,puppies,"I have 2 puppies who chew on everything. UPS delivered Ciara,unattended, but unfortunately they did not chew this bone up.WHO WHO WHO let the dogs out.Save your self some mental torment and throw this dvd away."
1,Going right in the trash . . .,There is no way to pour from this horribly designed gravy boat without having gravy cascading down the front and onto your tablecloth. What a waste of money . . . and gravy!
4,A World That Fell,"When I keep thinking about Peter Cetera, I always look back on his days with Chicago. After his departure from the group, his solo career has been a lackluster of a his former self.His 1992 album, World Falling Down, is a beautiful collection of songs that still spark a scream into any Cetera fan. The songs blend here elegantly from Restless Heart, Cetera's final Top 40 song, to his dynamic duet with Chaka Khan, on the song Feels Like Heaven, and even a short reunion with Chicago member, Bill Champlin on Wild Ways.Each song here still shows that same old soul that Cetera has been known for. Although many fans of Peter Cetera, still prefer his works with Chicago, this album still captures his once known signature sound. I truly enjoyed this album."
4,Good timeless CD,"This is a really good CD. It is similar to songs he wrote while with Chicago, only this CD has more heart to it. If you like good music that makes you feel, this is your CD."
5,power,"If you don't know about this subject, look into this powerful book. If you do know something about it, this book will add a human quality that is unforgetable"
1,"Not like ""Burn the Black Suit""","I was really dissapointed with this album from Juliet Turner, I was expecting something like ""Burn the Black Suit"", what a great album that was, ""Season of the Hurricane"" (do they have hurricanes in Belfast?) sounds like she has manufactured some pap for the masses of pap loving american market, none of her emotionally edgy and humourous song writing here."
1,not impressed,"to tell the truth,the robogrips made by craftman are just plain better. for the price of one made by rigid, you can buy two of the craftman(9&7inch combo) the craftman also come in a v-notch model, and they feel much nicer to use too. I own several products by rigid that I simply love to core,but I wasted my money on this one."
3,Similar to my Rothenberger Water Pump Pliers,"I like the auto adjustment feature on these, but it is a trade off when compared to the pipe gripping ability of my water pump pliers."
5,Best Film Yet,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire is the best film yet in the series. Film #'s 5,6,and 7 should be even better. The books can be read over and over again without getting old. So keep watching, reading, and loving this series."
2,Disapointing,"Perhaps I'm growing tired of Harry Potter. I've read all the books, seen all the movies. I liked this book OK but somehow it looked pretty stupid on the screen. It seemed to follow the book OK but it looks stupid.I don't know what else to tell you on this one. I felt ripped off."
2,too dark,I didn't care for this movie as much as the previous Harry Potter movies. It was way too dark visually and mood-wise. I found the ending abrupt and confusing even though I read the book. There was very little to make you laugh so the book was way more fun than the movie. Very disappointed. I hope a new director with a different approach is chosen for the next movie.
2,Going Downhill,"I was severely disappointed after watching this movie and so were all my friends who read (and even some who didn't read)this book. This movie leaves out everything in the book, things which we think are important to the story and to the books later on. The actors didn't fit the character descriptions (Mad-Eye Moody, Fleur, etc.) The third movie is probably the best so far. This book is my favorite of the six, but the movie is the worst so far. Sure, the movie is funny, but it just isn't the book. Two and a half hours isn't even to visually create this masterpiece."
4,Very dark,"This is the darkest one in all the series so far (no surprise if you know the book). It is not your good-feeling films. Despite the darkness of the film, there are some funny moments. It did cut out lots of stuff just to fit it into the time constraint.It would be nice if the quddish(sp) match in the beginning is a bit longer. Also would be nice if the dragon stuff also show what the other champion gone through.It is good that you see the struggle in Harry in making the right moral decisions in real time.Since there are so much stuff in the book, the film really do not have the time to develope the characters the way the book does.Overall a good film despite its darkness"
3,harry potter 4,"I thought that the beginning was very bad because my mum went to see it and did not know all of the characters e.g the caretaker. i think that the events should come in the write order because barty crouch jn was not in the dream in the book. i know that they couldnt fit in all the things but i have read goblet of fire many times and some bits of the film confused me. i enjoyed the movie but i expected more and it somehow was better for me to imagine it then watch a film like that. it left me frustrated as i expected more. But it was good film,with excellent camera shots and visual effects, so it deserves 3 stars at least. with all due respect, maya batcock xxx"
4,Too Choppy,"The movie was really good, considering it's a very long book, but I think it was a bit choppy. They cut out the Dursleys, the houselves, and Sirius. You did see a head in the fire, but not the way the book presents it. There was too little time between tasks. We didn't get to see the imperius curse. Or Bertha and Frank at the Priori Incantatem. It was good otherwise. I just didn't get to see a lot of my favorite parts from the books. It upset me a bit."
5,Wish it were two movies instead of one,"Any movie that keeps me from checking my watch deserves 5 stars, and there aren't that many that can keep my attention that long. Although this is the best Harry Potter movie yet (with the first Harry Potter a VERY close 2nd), I missed several of the subplots that the book provided. The analytical side of my brain did notice that some seemingly unrelated scenes were added merely to portent events in the fifth and sixth movies. I thought it unfortunate that several major characters got almost no screen time. Having said that, my spouse (who quit reading the series during the second book, but who has seen all the movies) also thought that Goblet was very entertaining.People who think this is a children's series of books don't understand that these are adult books about children. I'm really impressed that Rowling is maintaining her writing excellence. Many writers, once they achieve popularity, don't."
3,Harry Potter 4,It was interesting but most of it was depressing. They made the dragon part waaaaay too dramatic!! I mean ya know he's not gonna die if there's more books. The whole sliding down the tower thing was good but it was way over dramatic.
4,ARE THESE PEOPLE CRAZY!?,"Well, first of all I heard that they are cutting out the Dirsley's,Mrs. Weasley, and a lot of other characters! J.K. Rowling, if you are ever reading this you need to make sure this stops! I love the books and they are just tearing them up and turning them into a load of crap! I love the movies, they are wonderful, except they are different from the book ever since PoA started. SS and CoS were wonderful and they were very loyal. But when PoA was started the movies went down hill. I just think the cast and crew needs to sit down for a day at a meeting and consider and think of what they are doing to J.K.'s marvelous storys!If this keeps on hapening they mind as well not do OotP. I also noticed that the book POA was much longer then COS, but the movie POA was 24 minutes shorter than COS. That is proof that they are definitly not staying loyal to the books! Please consider this and make a change.! -Nickolas Post of Ohio :)"
3,I dont know what to Expect.,"well, chris columbus could of kept directing the thing, i mean i am a huge fan of harry potter and all but, ever sice c c stopped filming, the image of harry potter has totaly shanged in the movie. The location and the time turner wasnt really what i expected. Newel said he wouldnt cut anything, but u have 2 or else it could be 20 hrs long.But yet u might think its nessesary to cut. SPEW might be cut. but romantic comady, no mrs w and possibly shorter than azkaban. they should atleast make it longer than cos. I just dont no wat 2 expect...."
3,We don't know until we see it!,"I was totally disappointed with Harry Potter 3. (It's my favorite stand alone book). The books are definately getting more mature, we need a director who can keep up. We need Tim Burton! (At least for number 5). He would be brilliant!"
3,not what it could have been,"I supose the person who has never read the book would enjoy this move very much, because it has great special effects. however; if you have read the book you will find the move is not up to par, they not only left out many of the things that made the book great, but changed them as well. Of all the movies they have made so far I would rank this third on my list and the Prisoner Azkaban 4th. I personaly am glad some one else is writing the script for the next movie. Maybe he will do the books justice!!!"
5,How to review,"My question and comment about this book/Movie is how do you have a review of 41/2 stars when a movie hasnt even been released yet, nor the book?"
1,ENOUGH ALREADY!,First of all I am not really a kid reviewer but this is the only way to remain aynomonous.WAKE UP!... Why are we teaching our kids that this Harry Potter garbage is good entertainment? This is not REAL VALUE ENTERTAINMENT PEOPLE!!! Everyone treats this goofy Potter character as some kind of hero...What is wrong with today's society? They really need to stop making these ridiculous movies and publishing the HP books for that matter! Daniel Radcliffe will never be takin as a serious actor unless he makes other REAL motion pictures besides these HP movies. The world would be a better place without all this stupid Harry Potter hoopla!!!
2,ooooh please!,"this move stunk the first time i watched it. It left out way to many details and most of them were wanted. In this movie they show one quittende whatever match and they didnt show harry liking cho and that was so not the way the book went. fred and george didnt catch harry leaving the place like that in the invisibiltity cloak and then neville and snape cought harry before he went. And at romertas pub harry, ron and hermonie all were allowed to go in. and over heard the conversation together. Some say the movie would have been way too long with detail but at least you understand the whole movie, it wouldnt have even been that long anyway it wasnt even 3 hours long like the lord of the rings books. Then i watched it at home and relized they had to give harry the broom at the end because there was hardly any movie to put it in. IT WAS TOOOOOOO SHORT!!:{"
5,Harry Potter coolest film of the series,"When I saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , me and my mate thought it was the best one of the series , we thought it would be all about the special affects , however the both of us were pleasently suprised that it was not . I was not scared , as it wasn't a scary film but it does have a tendency to make you jump! Tense , shocking , funny and sad , its the best Harry Potter movie i've ever seen ! I do not recomend taking younger kids than 7 , even with an adult , to see it , lots of 4-5 year olds were there and they were terified ! the best film yet !!!!!"
5,One Word For This Movie!,THere is but one word for this movie! AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Why is everyone already reviewing this movie?,"Why is everyone already writing reviews for this movie? True, the Harry Potter movies that have been released so far are good, but if people liked the first three, they should go review those (or review the books). People cannot just base their reviews on assumptions, and comment on how good or bad a movie is without actually seeing it! I gave this a three star rating, because, well firstly I cannot post this message unless i give a star rating, and secondly, I don't know whether the movie will be good or bad, so I just put an average for it.If you would like information on the movie, go to IMDB or the main Harry Potter website, but please, stop criticizing the movie before you actually see it."
3,"Good movie, but not great for book fans","The Goblet of Fire was a good movie that had some great special effects, some funny moments, some scary moments, some hold your breath moments. But as a fan of the books, I was immensely disappointed. There was much deviation from the story. The movie felt choppy and artificially orchestrated. I don't know how folks who hadn't read the book even followed the story. Many people I've chatted with just hope the DVD adds back everything that was skipped over in the theater release."
4,"Definitely attention-grabbing, but something missing","As one who has never read any of the Harry Potter books, my opinions are based solely on what I have seen on the screen in these movies. I like them all, but the darker they get, the less I like them. Goblet of Fire is no doubt entertaining and interesting, but one of the things I liked in the first two movies was the character development and friendship of Ron, Hermione, and Harry - and Hagrid. There's not much of that in Goblet of Fire. I'll definitely buy this DVD when it comes out, as I have all of the others. My favorite Harry Potter movie so far, though, for what it's worth, is Chamber of Secrets."
3,I'm At A Lost For Words!!!,"The movie was not what I expected... It was okay, but... I just... The movie missed a lot of important parts that should have been included. Dobby, the houseelf wasn't even in the movie, but he was supposed to, and there was so much more that should have been included... It was an okay movie...not what I expected though... Cause to me it seemed like it jumped to parts to other parts of the movie and... Well it just wasn't what I expected..."
5,shut the hell up and accept this wonderful soundtrack for what it is,if you evil doyle hatters dont like it you should all jump off a brige and die
2,Predictable,"My family and I went and rated it 2 good, 1 OK, 2 bored. The movie was too predictable. There was a bit of a Soap Opera in this movie regarding who was going to take who to the ball. The movie was too choppy. It tried to wow us with fascinating special effects, so we didn't notice how poor of a movie this was. Harry Potter fans want suspense and thrills with a crescendo to the finish. Where were the Demontors? Had to have some hint of Quidditch - enough!"
4,Quite Ok.,"OK.. HPGOF comes out.. In my country India , the theatres are running house full.. Personally I did not think the movie was as good as i was thinkin it to be.. high expectations.. they have cut so much....... the whole winky part.. no house elves.. no ludo bagman.. they even cut the world cup match.. but thats ok.. cos it wud have taken a lotta time. n before the 3rd task harry practices spells with his frnds , thats cut.. then the rita skeeter beetle thing.. ppl will only understand all wat im sayin if theyve read the book... neways not a bad movie.. excellent special effects.. im still gonna get it when it releases on dvd for my collection.. 5th one due now.. n 7th book!!! YAY!!!"
4,The Best of the Four,"Just saw the lastest Harry Potter Movie today...Very good special effects. The story line ran too fast into each scene though. Feel that it would be very confusing for someone who has not read the books. Luckily we have, many times."
4,i watched the movie!!!,i went @ 12am to see the first release in my city! it was a great movie for the parts from the book that were used. alot of the story was jumped over and shortened due to the time frame the producers had to make the movie time. i honestly think they should have broken down this book into a 2 part movie. it was an awesome movie anyway! im still waiting for the next book... -faints- hurry J.K. Rowling!!!!
1,Sucked!!!!,This movie sucked and The Prisoner Of Azkaban is way better.Plus this movie has absouloutley nothing to do with the book and it's crap.So please don't buy this movie when it comes out please I'm begging you.You will hate it dearly and you'll definitely regret it a lot!
1,Terrible,"1. It's still shorter than the 1st 2 movies.2. They are wearing worse clothes than in movie 3.3. It seems like Mike Newell is making this movie into a romantic comedy.4. It's a Ron/Hermione relationship.5. It's not accurate or literal and a lot of scenes are cut off.6. There is more singing, and this will be a lot lighter too.7. The camera work and the costumes are horrible from what I saw.8. Many people are cut from the movie like the Dursleys, Percy Weasley, Bill or Charlie Weasley, and John Williams is being replace by Patrick Doyle.9. Change is not always good, PoA proved that.10. The sets and scenery still looks horrid from HP 3.11. Why can't WB find a director that can actually direct and not give us crap from BBC or Masterpiece Theatre?12. I can hope that HP 5 will improve from all the director's rubbish we've been getting."
3,The third movie,"I agree with a lot of the other people saying how disapointing the third Harry Potter movie was. They left too much out. Why cant they be like Lord of the Rings and actually put a good portion of the book in the movie? The I am hoping they dont leave too much out of the fourth one. I was disapointed they left out the part where Harry out races Malfoy, and all the cool Quiditch stuff. And why was Wood not in this movie? The movie just doesnt make sence when you leave almost all the important parts out. So, if any of the directors are reading this, PLEASEdont leave too much out of Goblit of Fire... I dont care how long you have to make the movie, trust me, sales will go higher the less stuff you leave out."
5,very nice!,"I like it because it don't show any panty line when I'm wearing pants. Quality wise...,it needs to be improved. There is some loose threads specially at the upper lace part of the waist, other than that...,it's pretty good."
5,"Cute, stylish, comfortable, and they fit like a dream","I love these boy shorts! They look kind of silky and are very flexible, comfortable, and flattering. They offer enough coverage that nothing is falling out or bulging over, and the overall look is sweet and sleek. A great underwear essential."
2,"Wonky sizing, climbs more than expected","I have trouble finding a brief that does not ride up so I chose these based on reviews stating that they would stay put. I had trouble choosing my size: I have a 12-inch difference between waist and hip and though the panties fit low the sizing chart is based upon waist size. I ordered half-way between my waist and hip. The panties are made of a nice soft cotton and the lace is good quality--no itching, no rolling up--but they climb like mad. I only wear them to sleep and even then I wake up uncomfortable with them creeping up. I wonder if the problem might be solved with a larger size (plug my hip measurement into the waist measure on the size chart) but I'm not interested in the investment required to find out."
3,more fabric = larger wedgie,"I actually bought these underpants for when I shave the bikini area, because regular underwear causes those razor burn bumps (TMI??). After wearing them all day, they gave me a wedgie, but they appear to prevent razor burn, which is why I bought them."
2,Not what a expected,I didn't like this item very much because it seems to have terrible quality. It already came with a loose thread. But it fits good.
2,Misleading,"I bought these ""boy shorts"" to have a comfortable option around the house. I am a 45 year old man. These are not made for men much less boys. My butt must have been hungry because it was eating these shorts the entire time I tried to break these in.Can you call them girl shorts instead. False advertising to say the least"
4,nice panties,i love boy shorts that don't bind at the legs or ride up into a wedgie. these are quite nice.
5,This little book is vital to parents who make use of a baby sitter!,I received this book and the Infant and Child Care Skills (Education) (Paperback) by Monica M. Bassett as part of my orientation training to be an Au Pair. This is a great book and an essential in every home with children. You might not make use of a babysitter but having all the critical information and telephone numbers etc in one little book is simply brilliant. I refer to this book quite often.
5,The BEST fairy tale teller!! C.S. Lewis' favorite!!!,"A MUST for Christians who love fairy tales that say something deep but also for non-believers, too!! Each tale makes you think. Some make you laugh and some make you cry.George MacDonald is a master and C.S. Lewis admitted he looked-up to this author. Don't let this volume pass you by!! A genuine feast for the mind, heart and soul."
5,Wonderful!,These are not like the Grimm Fairy Tales (which are grisly) - these are wonderful and uplifting. Great reading for ages 12 and up.
5,Grandpa George,Only MacDonald has visited Fairyland and has come back giggling. Ought to be on every bookshelf that contains what is beautiful.
2,Poor edition,A poor edition of this beautiful work. Binding and paper quality are not as expected considering the high price.
3,Death on the beach,"Peter Bartholemew and a young friend are taking a walk on the beach when they make a startling discovery, the dead body of a young local girl. The girl's twin and her mother are understandably distraught and Peter vows to help solve the mystery of her death. There are several suspects among the young people at the local high school, where Peter's ex-wife teaches, as well as others in the community. This book is not as well-written as many other ""cozies"", and involves some rather improbable scenarios, thus its average rating."
2,This is not a toy--it's a collector's item.,"We received this toy and immediately it was a problem. The helmet and cape don't stay on unless you superglue them and the lightsaber also comes apart. With all of the pieces falling off, this toy was not easy to play with and both my son and I were disappointed.I bought another one in the store where I could look at it and make sure of what was happening.This one goes better in someone's collection."
4,Very distinctive watch,"Very nice watch, very distinctive. Convenient to have 3 time zones in one place. The date is a bit small, but this watch is really about the time, and not the date. Feels weighty on the wrist. The polyurethane strap is surprisingly comfortable. I am currently wearing almost daily and it seems to be holding up well."
1,Not worth buying,"This drill seems cheap, but doesn't meet the basic functions of a drill. The fwd/reverse switch is terrible and doesn't always make contact. you have to try 2-3 times fiddling with it before the trigger works. The chuck is hard on your hands and impossible to tighten. Even tiny drill bits stick in what you are working on. Just useless even if it was free."
4,Easy to use,I was scared opening the box because only the boys in the family ever had their own drills but it was easy to use. It accepted the drill bits that I already had from my defunct hand tool and made drilling easy. I was done in seconds. It is a good addition to my art equipment.
5,hay bag,"This hay bag is great, I have 4 in my barn. They hold a lot of hay, 4-5 small flakes of 2-3 really large flakes. I highly recommend this bag. They hold up well, too."
1,Not if you value your mouthpieces!,"It looks nice, and it is convenient to hang the pouch on the nylon strap to my case. But I gave up on this pouch after the fourth time it dropped mouthpieces out of the gap between the closure flap and the top of the case. Two of them were damaged by landing on a concrete walk.After the first and second times the mouthpieces escaped, I closed the flap with great care each time. It didn't matter. The case needs a better fit at the top, a guard at the sides, or better yet a zipper closure."
4,Pseudoscopic Images (Pseudostereo),"Having been in stereo photography for nearly 50 years, I must point out that six of the images in this book were presented pseudoscopically, i.e., the left and right photos were reversed in printing. These prints were opposite pages numbered 6, 16, 20, 74, 76, and 84. When this left-to-right error occurs, the near objects appear to be distant and the distant objects seem close up, a very confusing situation for our eyes and brains to interpret. A technique known as cross-eyed viewing makes it possible to see these as they should be, but this requires a fair amount of practice.The pairs should have been proof read (examined) more carefully by the author before the material went to the printer. If you, the readers, think they look strange you are right.Stereo nut that I am, I still gave this book a rating of four, but it should perhaps have been downgraded to a three because of these glaring 3-D errors."
4,A Classic Adventure.,A great adventure from one of the first motorcycle adventurers. His tales are genuine and his connections with the people in the countries he visits are real. What I find refreshing is he is a sincere person with real anxieties and doubts. He doesn't hide his fears and lays it on the line.To comment on previous reviews. I did not find his observations that he was God or Jupiter bothersome. He was only commenting in the context of his long period on the road and did not detract from the book.
5,Light years ahead of his time!,"It still boggles the mind to think of the magnitude of what he accomplished, especially considering how far the technology of both bikes and accessories has come since Ted set out on his epic two-wheeled journey around the world. Nowadays you see folks riding big expensive dual-sport twins and triples from the likes of BMW and Triumph, sporting their exteme Kevlar/Gortex riding suits. But IMHO they dont seem to have the time or imagination to ride further than the nearest Mel's Drive-in. Seems to drive home the message that we, especially in the US have become so technology-obsessed that we are no longer capable of implementing a grand vision such as Ted did back in the 'stone-ages' of the '70s."
4,Nice account of travels,Nice account of travels abroad. What a difference the world is today. It would be an adventure today! But Africa would be diffucult
3,Different ....,"First half, especially transversing Africa, really good. Went downhill after that. Ted is a first and foremost a professional journalist. Just skip the dull and depressing parts."
3,"Jupiter's Travels interesting, but not always to the point","As someone who managed to put 36000 miles on his BMW motorcycle in two years I was interested in the story of a man who took it beyond the ""next level"". I enjoyed the book, but thought that Ted did not always get to the point and got sidetracked in his thinking process. Ultimately it boils down to his style of writing and a matter of personal taste... I recommend the book, but keep in mind that there will be pages one has to just chew through..."
5,amazing,"the author has real sense of adventure and has the ability to take you along. you see the sights,smell the smells with his style of writing you feel as though you are right there with him."
5,Jupiter's Travels one of the best adventure stories from the seat of a motorcycle,"This is a great personal adventure story about a man's search for himself. His around the world travels on the seat of a Triumph 500 is the vehicle for his adventure. Excellent book that I could not put down. I recommend that you then read Dreaming of Jupiter, Ted Simon's sequel to Jupiter's Travels."
4,A few issues,I loved this book and the way it was written but I did have a few issues with it. He seems to burn through countries the more you read. About half the book is about Africa and his first year on the road (of four) takes more than half the book so the other years seemed rushed. In one instance he goes through two countries and only describes it with a paragraph. But this book is still great and you should read it.
2,Nice Looking But Poor Quality,"We purchased this for our son and his wife. The top fell off one day and the nob on the top fell off because it was not properly welded to the sugar bowl lid. We tried everything to try and re attatch the nob, including Gorilla Glue but nothing worked so they now have a sugar bowl they can not take the lid off of without getting sugar all over the place. It is nice looking but I would not buy it again."
2,sugar bowl is to small,"I thought that the sugar bowl would be larger for every day use, it would of been excellant if it was. Thank you for asking for my opion."
4,Great sugar bowl,"This sugar bowl is perfect. It was smaller in size than I expected, but it holds lots of sugar, so it is perfect. Love the shiny finish and the little spoon is just right."
5,Sugar Bowl,"It's just the perfect size, the bowl (and lid) are unbreakable and it's very attractive next to the chrome coffee pot."
5,"One of my favorite small, shiny objects","I really do love this sguar bowl. It's very nice to look at--much better than one of those squat, ceramic bowls that are hand-painted with pictures of frolicking kittens (or whatever). The little spoon has a gently curving handle that allows it to rest just so in a side notch, and it holds about 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, the perfect size for a cup of tea (according to my husband)."
3,Sugar bowel,I thought it had more capacity then it had. The picture looked larger then when I received it. The product is well made just needs to be larger.
3,Two years old - not loving it any more.,this item works well and is pretty easy to assemble. Good deal for the money. The only problem is it calls for anti-freeze suitable for pools to fill the baffle. That is not easy to find in Atlanta. We tried two pool supply stores...Update... had it less than two years now. The bottom polyester baffle cover has fallen apart. It looks yucky.
2,I WANT MY PLANKEYE BACK!!!!,"I bought this CD because the lead singer, Scott Silleta, is the former lead singer of Plankeye, a group that has encouraged me immensely in my spiritual life. Well, so much for this album. Despite neat cover art and a good first track, there's nothing really to brag about in this CD. It's what you would call ""average"" music; it's okay listening, but nothing original. I mean, this is from a FORMER PLANKEYE ARTIST! There's nothing in here that measures up to that band. I suppose if you like punk you'll have fun with this, but I'd rather listen to Starflyer 59 or a classic Plankeye song."
3,Great design but expensive!,"The design of the Mouse sandpaper is fantastic. Each sheetcomes with 2 spare ""tips."" As the pointy tip of the sandpaper sheet on the mouse wears away much quicker than the body (because you use it to get into detailed areas), you can just replace the tip. This makes each sheet of sandpaper last much much longer.That's good news because the sheets are expensive! Talk about giving away the razor and selling the blades! The unti comes with 20 sheets of paper, which is nearly $[money] worth! Each sheet is over a $[money]!!!! Given that full sheets of sandpaper cost that much, it's pretty precious.Of course, you could become good at cutting out your own sheets. The mouse is great, but the company better get better at selling cheaper paper."
3,Mc Donald's as hidden sponsor,"This is a good game for kids. But as dinosaurs (GENESIS stopped making games in 1996) go, I am rating this as compared to games now. It IS really fun!!But DANGER!!! This has game has a hidden advert (just as C Cheetah for Cheetos and ZOOL for some kind of candy) Mc Donald's arches and Ronald show up. Look out for the devil CORPORATE aganda!!! PRAISE THE COMPANY!!!"
3,It's Okay just not great,Great improvement instruction wise on her last couple of videos. Very clear & detailed instruction.This video is for intermediate to advanced level.However the video is just nice variations on common moves.There is nothing new or really exciting in this video.It is a nice video just not great.
2,Josie can do better,"Josie is a great Salsa dancer and I love her style and agility, so it hurts me to score her video low.I think she could have done a lot better. My criticisms are:1. Salsa is sensual and fun, but they seemed stiff and somewhat mechanical.2. some of the combinations presented seemed forced. They didn't seem to have a natural flow.3. I also didn't find the combinations interesting.4. Taking out the section where all the moves taught are performed while dancing to almost a full song b/4 and/or prior to the moves being taught was a bad choice, in my opinion.I think her other advanced video was a much much better work."
2,Basic Presentation,"I bought this DVD after reading the first 2 reviews.Moves might be good, but quality and presentation of the DVD is very basic. Menu is poor, background music is the same.Furthermore, I was hoping to see the all the combinations put into practice instead of seeing the bloopers. Bloopers can be another ""extra"" feature on the DVD.In its place, I'd recommend Super Mario's salsa DVD which to me is far better presented both content and quality wise (if you are not too concerned about Super Mario's looks)"
2,Dissapointed with Bosch,"I work in the building industry, and have bought my share of tools. I purchased the Bosch 24V, thinking it would be a good replacement for my 6 year old cordless Dewalt drill. During two years of use, I have had numerous problems with this drill, and have gone back to my 8 year old Dewalt. The charger has been fixed twice. I have fixed this drill twice and it is currently in the shop getting a repair estimate. Bosch has a repution for depndable tools. I own several Bosch tools, but I am deeply dissapointed with this purchase."
1,The nose of this drill will break off!!,I am a Genral building contractor For 27 years and I started with a 9.6 makita back in early 80's then went to 12V milwaukee and then to this drill and niether fo this two drills are any good. Iam still using the old 80's Makita. I bought this drill basing it on other Bosch products and this has to be the worst. This drill fell off a SIX FOOT ladder and the whole nose of the BROKE COMPLETELY OFF. I will stay with Makita.
2,Excellent tool,"Really works well. For most of my remodeling, I leave my corded saw and drill in the shop."
1,Folk Songs of Okinawa,"There are two CDs with fifteen selections on each. Nearly all selections on this CD feature one shamisen and one singer. Consequently unless you are familiar with the words and tunes these selections sound alike. About four or five selections have a single flute or drum accompaniment. Most of the songs are slow ballads. If you expect a lively ""folk sound"" you will be very disappointed. If I was able to hear samples from this CD I would not have purchased it, but I took a chance and lost! I would not recommend this CD unless you know what you're getting!"
4,Human Genetics and Genomics Textbook,"I received the book only a week and a half after I ordered it, and if the weather had been better I would have probably received it sooner. The price was extremely fair, the quality was brand new, and it was the latest edition on the market. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
3,Human Genetics Text,This is the text my instructor uses for our class. It doesn't contain enough practice problems with solutions. I need to get another book that has more practice problems like we get tested on.
4,Ok for the price,"I bouught two, one for the boat and one to keep an extra battery fresh. Seems to work fine, but they are a bit noisy. Otherwise, a good value for the price paid."
3,Se-1-12S float charger,"I've used this unit for about a month with pretty good results. Does keep the battery up, although the cranking power is a little low in extreme cold. But it does start everytime. I use it on a compact utility tractor that is outside covered only by a tarp."
4,battery charger,"was as stated and could use a correct connector for ataching to battery for quick disconnect,there is a push together and pull apart plug that wouls make this product a 5 star item thanks for the great price."
5,Great Item,"Item does as described. I use to charge A small battery bank, running 35 amps X 4. It charges and stops when done and changes colors of lights. I use with A Seagate plug for A light when the power goes."
5,Great battery tender,"I can't be happier with this battery tender. My truck has a slow power drain that I just can't find, so this 1.5 amp charger keeps the battery charged up.The unit is a little BIG to mount in the engine compartment of most of todays vehicles so I had to be creative.The power cord could have been a little longer."
2,No 12 ft. power cord!,"The product description indicates that this product comes with a 12 ft. power cord which is why I opted for this model. Alas, I am now stuck with a 6 inch power cord."
1,Defective - noisy and never charged battery,"Product made a continuous loud noise when plugged into wall. After various checks and attempts including ""charging"" for over a week, car battery still dead. Since we did not give up on it until after 30 days, we tossed it in garbage rather than attempting to return product with restocking charge and shipping costs."
1,false advertixing,"The product shown is mounted with bent clamps that secure it with indentations located to the right on the ""face "" that is shown.The product received is mounted with two tabs that extend from the rear on the upper and lower sides of the charger."
1,Very bad implenentation,"I tried to use this on my automatic generator. When the generator starts, the charger quits charging and indicates a bad battery."
5,Keeps the battery charged,Works as advertised. Easy installation. May need to change terminal lugs to work correctly (depends on your battery terminals (screw in or clamp down). Keeps my truck charged. This is my second install of this product and I am ordering a third for another vehicle that doesn't get run very often. Saves time on having to jump the vehicle or get out a battery charger and let it sit overnight.Just remember to disconnect the power to the unit before starting the vehicle.
3,It Works,"As a Snowbirder, have battery charge problems with Golf Cart not used for several months during the summer. Trickle Charger should work"
4,"Defective, returned, promptly replaced, working fine","One of the 2 units originally ordered was defective: simply did not charge at all, even though green light was on while connected (also confirmed with use of electric multi-meter).Post office Return label was very conveniently and easily provided via Amazon website and email: a replacement unit was mailed to me while defective was on weight back to them. No additional shipping charges. Replacement unit worked.These 2 Schumacher onboard chargers are on an older JD tractor with two 12v batteries in series, to keep them loaded during winter. After 1/2 day, now have both lights red and green on, indicating full charge has been reached. Diesel engine cranks right up in 35deg outdoors, even though no glow plugs."
2,schumacher battery charger,"i purchased this charger for my boat motor,because my battery usually goes dead from not using it enough. my boat already has one on my trolling motor battery. i am not sure of the brand name, but it is compact,and very quiet. the schumacher charger is noisy,and i mounted it with the brackets recomended to use. the problem with this is the plastic on the charger has already cracked using there required brackets. i would deffinately recomend shopping for a more compact,and quiter charger."
3,Be aware - does not include quick connect plug,"Although the picture (from Electronic Gadgetphile, read his review) shows a quick disconnect plug, it's not part of the package. If you intend to use this charger with a late model motorcycle's built-in battery plug, get one of the Deltran chargers instead, which come with a quick disconnect plug as the default wiring method."
1,Schumacher battery charger,I purchased 3 of these units and two of them went bad within a year. I use them to maintain small tractor batteries.I have another unit offered by this company that is not sealed that one seems to work well.
4,happy,"When I had cable, it as a great product. to be honest, I had trouble setting it up, but thats me, I have alzhimers."
4,"Quality unit, reasonable price.","I installed this in one of my SUV's that is not driven for weeks at a time.The Schumacher unit keeps a perfect charge and does not overheat or dry out the battery. The clock, radio, and GPS settings are all preserved and the charger does not seem to draw much power when the battery is charged. I am very satisfied with the operation of the unit.The installation was a breeze with the included hardware and the instructions were clear and easy.I do have two small complaints, however:(1) The battery lugs were way too big for my vehicle and all other cars that I checked.(2) The AC plug is too short to run anywhere. I wanted the plug to reach to just outside the vehicle's grill, so that the unit could be plugged in without opening the hood. I had to install an extra extension cord for that purpose."
3,Review Shumacher SE-1-12S Car Battery Charger,"From page 12 of the instruction manual:""However, if you were to use this battery charger to charge a large battery, such as a marine deep cycle battery, that was not fully charged, you may lose some of the battery's capacity. This would cause the large battery to be unable to hold a charge and become useless. Therefore, we do not recommend charging a large battery with this unit.""The charger makes a loud buzz or hum caused by the transformer laminations vibrating.Have to use with an Astroflight Whattmeter used on charging the batteries on electric models to check the charging status, current and voltage.A timer was used to turn on the charger for four hours in the morning and four hours at night to conserve electricity."
4,Better discription,I bought this to charge and float charge the battery in my slide in camper but it is not made for deep cycle batteries. Insted of returning it I am going to wire it into my Dodge Piuckup for when it gets down to-20.
5,Works for me,"Use it for charging my bike battery. Works as advertised, didn't have any problems setting up or charging my battery"
4,jet ski battery saver,works perfect for items left over winter. makes the batteries last much longer from year to year. is ready when i get there
1,Bought 3 and all 3 failed within 3 years.,"Bought 3 units to sustain a car, truck, and a lawn tractor battery over winter storage months.All 3 units failed within 3 years.The quality of this product is poor.I cannot recommend this product."
5,Perfect.,"Used this for keeping the battery charged on my 2003 Hummer H2 (don't drive it much anymore). Mounted underhood to the ECM plastic cover and this allowed the AC cord to poke out into the drivers side wheelwell. Pull in the garage and just plug it in, don't even need to open the hood! Keeps the battery ready any time I need to drive it. Perfect!"
1,Published by Springer?,I only browsed the book but I perfectly agree with my friend from milano. Another one of those little useless trash marked with high price because they knew there would be few buyers. How can my favorite publisher Springer join this business? (John-Wiley seems to be the pioneer on this.)
3,Different opinion,"I haven't read this book yet (hence the intermediate 3 stars rating), but I think people should know that, [...] See e.g. http://www.techbookreport.com/tbr0031.html"
4,Old favorites,Wonderful music. Would be 5 stars but for the orchestration that seemed to overshadow the beautiful melody and lyrics on a couple of songs. Still happy I purchased!
1,Will Flummox The Future!,"They will have an much easier time explaining the appeal of the Beastie Boys and McDonald's Happy Meals than this in the future, believe me. And that it was supposed to be connected with great spiritual liturgical presences will be utterly incomprehensible, except to a very recondite sort of specialist.The number of spiritual lives ruined with this stuff is incalculable."
5,Very helpful reference,"Great quick reference, gives you just enough info to understand without providing too much and becoming overwhelming as a reference book"
2,Spend a little more for a better Jigsaw,"I don't typically have use for a jigsaw, so when a project I was working on required one, I purchased this product mainly because it was cheap. The first one I purchased I had to return because the ""Quick Clamp"" mechanism was broken. Once I got a working one in use I was disappointed with its performance. Instead of cutting smoothly through wood it has a tendency to jump around, particularly in plywood. It isn't well built either. Several of the high stress points, including the~ ""Quick Clamp"" are made of cheap plastic. If you are at all serious about your wood working, look elsewhere. If your primary objective is minimizing your costs, then this may be a fit for you. It does work, but leaves som"
4,Pretty darn good!,"Another solid effort by the Sons of the San Jaoquin! The CD is almost all songs from the singing-cowboy golden years of '30's-'40's Hollywood. The Sons' harmony singing is as close as ever -- truly wonderful.Maybe it's just me, but it seemed to me that they employed a few more instrumentalists on this CD, as well and it was a great choice.If you like cowboy music, this is YOUR CD."
5,Wonderful choice of instrumentation,"I highly recommend this recording to people that known about Bach's music. Alessandrini's choice of the instrumentation ( violin, viola cello, 2 oboe d'ámore and harpishord, is excellent since captures the deep of the sound of Bach's work."
5,Slammin',"this cd is Slammin,I just love all the songs.My favorite two are my life and confusion.Keep coming with those slammin hits JustRo."
4,Beautiful Furnishing,"Being a mariner, I've purchased Weems & Plath instruments for years.They are beautiful and well finished but I wouldn't consider them accurateweather instruments."
2,These pads are SUB PAR. Go with a different brand!,"Although these nursing pads get the job done as far as protecting you from leakage, they only do the bare minimum.Pros:-Thin-LargeCons:-Poor absorbency-Make your boobs itch-Tear apart easily-Purple material feels cheap; sticks to your boobsThe NUK and Tommee Tippee brands are far better than these. Those 2 brands are soft and comfortable with high levels of absorbency and they don't fall apart or stick to your boobs."
2,These do not absorb well at all!,"That is all I have to say. I wore these to sleep and woke up with a wet bra and a wet shirt, even though they do stay in place..."
2,Ouch!,"These are hard and scratchy! I purchased Lansinoh pads and they are SOO much softer. Spend the extra money and get the good stuff, these are painful on your nipples when they're already beat up from the baby sucking on them."
2,no adhesive,"these were for my wife...obviously. she complained that there was not adhesive on the pad to stick to her bra. however, that did mean there was no adhesive to stick to the trash can when she throws them away, which means i don't have to reach in and pull them out when i empty the trash. i guess you can't make everyone happy!"
2,no sawzall,"i am a contractor, i thought finally a cordless set with enough power to justify putting it in the truck and pulling it out on a job. it works great, plenty of power. one of my workers was pulling out a screw on a float over the water and the chuck backed off and fell in,(1 month old) a bosch mechanic said that bosch wouldn't replace it. the drill has to much power to use in reverse over the water, was what was told to me. after alot of anger they finally replaced it.the second thing is i bought it in june 2002 and was told the it was a higher price because you get a free sawzall. WRONG that ended april 2002 and BOSCH wont do anything about it. bottom line is no free sawzall"
1,Save Your money and time,I had purchased the Bosch 24 volt combo kit approximately a year ago in hopes of purchasing a great product. Bosch has not lived up to their name on this product. It ranks up there with the cheapest cordless tool you can find on the market. I do not recommend this tool to anyone. Within the first month of use the drill/driver motor had to be replaced. It took about 3 weeks to get it repaired. A month later the charger broke and I repaired it myself. I have replaced both batteries. Now I have to tape or strap the batteries to the tools in order to keep them from falling off. I have consulted with the manufactures and basically it comes down to the fact that they do not stand behing their product.
1,Irish Setter 2006 Calendar,"Although the calendar itself is very nice, the fact that you are selling 2006 calendars in 2007 is a bit upsetting. I ordered this calendar assuming that the 2006 year was a misprint since it was February 2007. Silly me! I am very disappointed that Amazon would do this, especially selling at full price."
2,Poor longevity,"I got this for Christmas a few years ago and it initially worked well but within a year, the battery life was very short."
1,"Dekcell Laptop Battery for Toshiba PA3307U-1BAS, PA3307U-1BRS","We could not get this battery to work with our Toshiba Laptop, but we don't know if it was the battery or the laptop not charging it right tobe fair, the seller was very professional and gave us our credit without any problems"
2,Do-it-yourselfers avoid costly sandpaper,"Although the Black and Decker Mouse can be a handy gadget for sanding, the cost of replcement sandpaper will take the finish off any project.Six dollars for five sheets is approx, 10 times the cost of replacement paper for orbital sanders.I had to adjust my B and D to accept less costly adhesive backed paper.......buyer beware of expensive accessories."
3,Probably Would Be Perfect If It Fit....,I have a B&D Mouse from 2009 and this does not fit. Apparently in the last 3 years they changed the sanding heads and they're a lot smaller! So this is way too small for my sander. Very disappointed since I can't seem to find the right size anywhere. That'll be the last time I purchase anything B&D! So frustrating!!
2,Coarse is really Medium,"Ordered the Coarse Sandpaper and received Medium. The shipping cost was almost as much as the paper so it was a real disappointment. However, I just went to Black&Decker; site. It said <<Sandpaper for the Mouse sander is available individually and in assortments in 120 coarse, 180 medium, and 240 fine grit.>> So what is universally accepted as Medium, and until recently was labeled as Medium for the Mouse paper, is now labeled Coarse, and the 180 which is only slightly less coarse is now labeled Medium.I love the sander... it's light and easy to use, just hard to find the accessories.[...]"
2,Very good detail sander,"Ordered 3 pack's of coarse grit and 5 pack's of medium grit paper. Got 3 of med and 5 fine paper. Seller did offer me to send them back, said the item was miss-labeled right, too much hassel. Will look else where for the coarse."
4,Sand paper for mouse sander,Ordered Coarse Grit Sandpaper. Received Medium Grit sandpaper. I called the seller. It turned out that the wrong information had been put into the Amazon ad -- they had no coarse sand paper. They sent me a pre-paid UPS return label and immediately refunded my payment as soon as I returned the item.
5,TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT SEASON TWO,I LOVE THIS SHOW WHEN IT WAS ON THE AIR BUT I LOVE THAT I CAN NOW WATCH IT AT HOME WITH MY FRIENDS WHO ARE YOUNGER THEN ME AND KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE GREAT SHOWS FROM THE 80'S
3,Devastating news.,"I just read about this show on Wikipedia. I remember seeing this show as a child, but don't remember much about it. The only thing the show haunted me with was it's opening theme song, sounding like something the band ""Steely Dan"" would've done. According to Wikipedia, they said it is believed that ""RHINO ENTERTAINMENT"" have lost the rights to the tv series. Therefore no more seasons will be available until further notice."
2,too close for comfort,This is a must for everyone and for all ages. Hilarious and very down to earth comedy. Just seeing Ted Knight will make you laugh and his actions will tickle every part of you. Great stuff and I highly recommend it. Unfortunately there are only 2 seasons and wish there were more. Too Close for comfort is the most satisfying comedy series you will ever find.
1,A series of tropes packaged with a poor emulation of Paul Auster,"Throughout the book I kept waiting for the book to redeem itself, and that redemption never came. It clearly was trying too hard to be ""deep"" and postmodern, exemplified by the introduction itself:""He came there in the off-season. So much was off. All bets were off. The last deal was off. His timing was off, or he woouldn't have come here, and also every second arc lamp along the peninsular highway was switched off.""The dialogue was stilted and awkward, the plot had no flow, and the ""lesbians"" in the book were clearly heterosexual male fantasies of what lesbians _should_ be. None of the characters ever came to life, least of all Lenny English himself. The ""plot"" was a series of tropes, one after another. It was as though a Freshman philosophy major read Auster's New York Trilogy and set out to emulate it."
3,Good game but it couldn't bear the gold!,"Golden axe one was a classic and this game just fell short. The enemies are repetitive, and I think the graphics are in some ways improved and in some ways worse!Its very similar to the first one, there is a new dark emperor in town, and you gotta do the dirty job. Run around, fight barbarians, evil ghost skeletons with swords, with lots of dragons, magic and sword slashing to keep you entertained for a while."
3,Golden Axe II,"Golden Axe II is a full action hack n' slash game for sega megadrive/genesis. It offers a wide variety of enemies, attacks and magics. The player can choose between three different characters.Although its made for the sega genesis console, wich has no savingfunction i felt the game was a bit too short. If you play effectively, the complete game can be done in about 1,5 hours. A good function is that the game has three diffrent difficulties, of wich the easiest does not offer play of the entire campaign."
3,zzzzzzzzz,"I saw the hype about Mr. Winchester's new CD, and, not being familiar with him, I thought I'd give it a try. Yawn. Then I read the Amazon reviews, and thought, well, maybe I missed something. Listened to it some more. Passable, but not great, I thought. There were a couple of good songs, but God knows, I couldn't remember the names of 'em. So, I loaned the CD to a friend who's musical tastes I trust. She gave it back a day later, with a neutral sort of shrug. I dunno, maybe there's some massive group think going on. But this CD will likely sit in my cabinet until my next garage sale. And even then, I'm not sure I'll be able to give it away."
4,In the Groove agaain,"This album is of course vintage jesse in the sense that it is like all of his other material.Of course that is a good thing since he writes and sings so well.Interesting that he plays very little if any guitar on this one,playing the 88s instead.Still sounds like some of the tunes were written on guitar though (Club Manhattan eg ).He could have been a gospel singer/writer as well...the religious beat of gospel runs through this cd as usual(remember I Cant Stand up on Learn to love it).Another cd in a great lineage.....but whats a guy his age doing at the club Manhattan"
2,Too good to be true,"I suckered because the price was attractive, but after very little use, the ink coverage was spotty or faint. And I waited too long to return it. My bad. Your warning."
1,Poor product,"I bought this product thinking it would perform as well as other TN570 I bought online. Unfortunately, after a couple of months, this thing started making loud noises and bad prints. I am unable to return. I will not buy from this company anymore."
5,Good as original.,"There is no surprise. Good package. It works at first try. Of course, I don't know how long it will last."
4,Its a 90's game what do you expect?,I loved this game as a kid. I found it on amazon and had to buy it. The first few times you play its fun. We are 2 spoiled now with being able to save games. In these oldies you gotta start back to square one as soon as you die which can be frustrating. After that you pretty much had enough of it! But its different in its own way. Im glad I bought it.
1,"Tinny sound, rip-off ""transfers""","Solomon was a master pianist, with a sensitive tone and a rich sonority. But, to appreciate him, and other great historic pianists, listen to the original transfers on the APR, Pearl, Testament, and other such historic labels, or in the Philips series, Great Pianists of the Twentieth Century, not to the tinny rip-offs in this Italian series, ""The Piano Library"". Every dollar taken away from those labels and transfer masters, like Bryan Crimp of APR, who actually do the creative work, makes it less likely that they will stay around to do more.)For Solomon, find the APR ""Signature"" disc, or the Philips Great Pianists 2 CD set, or the EMI Beethoven concertos (and late sonatas if they are your cup of tea)."
4,Really nice product for the price.,"I've been using this mini-grinder for a while now, and really like it. I have used it to grind a plastic bumper in preparation for plastic welding. Worked great. I've also deburred some metal I cut, shaped some wood I had laminated into a three-dimensional piece for use on a gaff-rigged sailboat, and various other little tasks. It has sufficient power for my needs. I have reasonably large air compressor which has no problems powering this little gem, so can't comment about how much air the grinder needs.The unit appears to be quite well built; I expect it to last for a long time. It's easy to change bits and easy to use."
2,I was teenage zombie,"When some teenagers accidentlly kills a drug dealer, they dump his corpse in a polluted river and toxic chemicals turns the corpse in to an murderous zombie. And the undead drug dealer starts to kill the ones that originally killed him while the surviving teenagers tries to find out how to make the living dead dead again. A bit crappy, but fans of The Return Of The Living Dead movies may like it. Should problably please any average zombie fan."
3,Funny spoof of zombie movies ruined by poor video quality,"I Was a Teenage Zombie is a really funny spoof of those 1950s monster films and zombie films. A drug dealer is accidentally killed by teens and then the teens throw him in the river where a nuclear liquid brings him back as a zombie and then he starts revenge. The video release is poor because the movie skips a lot even if you clean the VCR. Please release this one on a new DVD with special features(Commentaries,deleted scenes) because the VHS/DVD versions are horrendous. This one deserves a Special Edition DVD for fans of this spoof."
2,Campy take off on high school horror films of 50's and 60's.,"I was young reckless and in love, then I was dead, young reckless and in love-I was a teenage Zombie. The film has a killer new wave soundtrack but it wasn't filmed that well or recorded that well but actually is pretty funny if you let it. As hard as it is to believe the film was distributed by Janus Films who have the Criterion Collection. Unfortunately the soundtrack album is out of print."
4,I was a teenager impressed,"The minute this movie starts with a long shot of a lake and the hilariously bad rockabilly/swingin' song ""I Was a Teenage Zombie"" (by the Fleshtones), you know you're in for a treat. There is a Mexican pimp selling some bad weed, and he is just amazing. In one scene, he rips a guy's face off and says, ""Yeah, I'm the weedman! I got some WEED!"" I was rolling on the floor laughing. One of the characters changes into a baseball uniform JUST to hit another character in the head with a baseball bat and then changes back in the next shot. It's all very humorous. I'm guessing the people who gave this a bad rating were expecting a Fulci classic or something."
1,Look For Something Else,"Bought this item and within 10 minutes, toast. Returned and replaced the item thinking I had a lemon. Opened the new package, plugged in the unit and poof!We don't see the forest through the trees. You get what you pay for. There has to be a really good reason why this tool is more expensive than some but cheaper than others. Maybe we're paying for a brand name to be stuck on a non-brand name quality item. Shame on you B & D. I don't care what brand you sell or under what brand you hide, You won't see any more of my money."
1,B&D Heat Gun,Excellent product. I needed some customer service and it was excellent. The product does the job it was intended to do excellently. I am glad I purchased the B&D; Heat Gun.EH
4,GOOD BUY,This little guy works great but remember this tool is designed with the homeowner in mind and is not intended for heavy duty work all day long.See milwaukee for that.This tool can be used for so many things no shop should be without one. It is worth the price even if you only use it now and then. Just because this tool is inexpensive does not make it junk.This would suit any homeowner just fine.Remember right tool for the right job and black and decker has been doing this stuff for a long time.
2,Definitely a light-duty tool.,"I bought this heat gun to strip the paint of a doorway in my apartment. Initially it worked well, but after a few hours of intermitten usage it just stopped working. I thought that the tool had burned out, but after cooling down completely it started working again. I guess there must be some kind of temperature-activated relay which cuts the power to protect the gun from overheating. In the end this heat gun got the job done, but the power cut-off occured several times more, and it was annoying having to stop what I was doing and wait for the gun to cool off. If you're looking to do just light-duty heating work, this would be a good tool for you. Otherwise go for something more reliable and durable."
4,Worked like a charm,We used the heat gun to loosen epoxy holding undermount vanity sinks. We removed the sinks easily. It worked like a charm.
2,The Golden Tulip,"I love Rosland Laker, but I just could not get interested in the Golden Tulip. It just seemed that too much was happening in the family and unlike her other novels, did not follow a main Character. To Dance With Kings and Banners of Silk were just wonderful books, written in Ms. Lakers style."
5,A fast and wonderful read,"I loved this book. I learned a lot about the art of the period, the social mores and found the characters are enthralling."
2,The Golden Tulip,"I've picked this book up and tried to read a few pages 4 or 5 times recently. I simply can't get interested in either the characters or the storyline. It could be like Moby Dick, you really need to get into the heart of the book before it becomes interesting: but it's so boring that I finally gave up and put it in my stack of books for Goodwill."
4,A plethora of interesting subjects,"This novel was extremely interesting, as it covered a wide scope of areas: art and the Amsterstam artist's guild, tulip growing and tulip mania, and the context of the Dutch war with France.The characters are well-developed, and the female protagonist is one which was easy to relate to.However, there was not a strong beginning to this novel, and I would advice readers to stick with it through the first few chapters as it does get much better. The problem, in my opinion, with the beginning of this novel is that the author has tried to pack in too much background information in a short period of time. It gets tiresome, as each page skips to years ahead. A quick prologue may have been a better way of allowing the reader to acquire the necessary background information.Yet, once you are past these initial chapters, the story takes over and you will find yourself emerged in the fascinating world of 17th century Amsterdam."
4,The Golden Tulip,"I first found Rosalind Laker while wondering through the public library and from that moment on, I became an avid fan. I particularly loved this book because of how the scenery and atmosphere of Holland came to life. The characters had a life of their own. I often found my self shocked by their actions and thoughts, particularly those of Hedrick, Francesca's father. His selfishness seemed so unbeleivable to me, and yet he still had redeming qualities. Francesca seemed such a strong woman, who falls in love and yet never loses sight of her dream. As with other Rosalind Laker books, the ending seemes hurried and yet I closed the book very satisfied and comfortable. I would definelty reccomend this book to any one who loves historical fiction love stories, where you can find astonishing parrallels to your own life. Great book!"
5,Great Fan!,"We had our new Hunter Bayport 42"" fan installed by an electrician (since we are DIY-challenged) to replace a ceiling fan that was in the house when we bought it. The fan is in the breakfast nook and it cools the whole kitchen. We really like having the wall rheostat so we can adjust the fan speed without having to pull the chain. The only small drawback is the rosewood/oak blades don't match the kitchen, so I'm going to take the blades off and paint them to match the woodwork. We had searched several websites to find Hunter antique brass (to match 2 existing antique brass fans in the living area) and were very pleased to find what we wanted at a great price on Amazon."
1,No where near the best,I was expecting a better product from black and decker. It is light and tends to move quiet a bit while using it (leading to not so straight edges). The variable saw speed button is very sensitive and requires a lot of control (and setting it to a fixed speed is rather hard). Overall its not worth buying.
4,very pleased with this product!,"I would like to say how pleased I am with this saw. The feel and weight was perfect. I also liked the power and the ease of control it had. I also liked the feature of the sight line, which made it very easy to see where you are cutting. The added built in storage case for your blades was a plus! Only thing I wished it came with, is a carrying case."
1,"Blade falls out, very frustrating","This saw almost always loses the blade after just a few strokes. I have tried different blades including Black and Decker but they all come out while cutting.I have many B&D; tools, most of them very good ones including a compound miter saw, a table saw and reciprocating saw. All were very reasonably priced. But I have problems with B&D; drill chucks that won't hold a bit, and with this saw that won't hold the blade.If you are a mild-mannered person who never swears and you are thinking of learning to curse, buy this saw. It will have you cussing like a sailor in no time!"
3,Keep it simple,"You can't compare to expensive model like Bosch, but for the price, its a great saw. Cuts straight, blows dust very well.Needs flat head screw driver to change blade, but it will never come loose while using it.I have slide the sole plate aft to accmodate the T-shank blades that fits on Bosch. Using nice expensive blade compensates makes the cut easier, smoother and faster."
1,Junk - in TRUE Black & Decker style,"This company's products are garbage. Their jigsaws are no exception. I need a jigsaw about once a year. So, I bought a B&D; with the quick release blade system. The blade is locked in place when you start, but soon enough it will simply pop out. The blade will be lodged in whatever surface you are trying to cut. REALLY frustrating.I noticed that if you exert a bit of upward/forward pressure it helps, but it can't be trusted to cut a surface w/o the blade falling out.Do yourself a HUGE favor, don't buy B&D.; I will never buy this brand or SKIL ever, ever again. Both have life cycle designed only to exceed the return policy of the store. It's all trash.Costs more, but I've bought Dewalt a few times now and they're worth the money. Even bought them used with great success. I have Dewalts several years old, no issues. For decent performance at a good price try Ryobi. Isn't Dewalt, Bosch, or Milwaukee, but it ain't this CRAP."
1,Yuck,"I also own this jig saw, and the blade keeps falling out. If it can't hold a blade in place, it's worthless. If you have one of these, and the blade stays in, well, good for you."
5,Excellent disk,"i listen it and im transported back in time...back to the old good days... some songs could be added, but it would depend on personal taste, i think a 2 disk album would be nicer here since there are more songs from TRU that can be considered the best. overall any TRU fan would enjoy this piece of memories."
3,Alright,This CD is ok. I purchased it because there was only ONE song on here that I wanted and liked.
4,A lot of fun on cloudy nights,"Condos has brought the original sources of the myths surrounding the constellations of the Northern Hemisphere to a 21st century audience. The book is illustrated with Renaissance woodcuts, as opposed to modern photos or maps, which I think emphasizes the long chain of literature that bound the ancients & the Renaissance together. I feel, though, that it might've been interesting to see how the stars we see at night really did form those shapes that the ancients were convinced were there-some of the constellations, like Aquarius & Capricorn, always escape me."
4,recommendable book,"This is a very interesting and readable book. I hope to read HYGINUS' ""The MYTHS of Hyginus"" once translated by M. Grant in 1960. I think the latter is more interesting to read for the fans of Greco-Roman mythology."
2,Not a perfect fit,"Other reviewers indicated this battery was a replacement for the Dewalt 9.6 volt. It will fit, but only after trimming off part of the battery housing. Additionally, it is quite a bit lighter than the Dewalt, which translates to less capacity."
3,Dewalt 9.6v replacement battery,Seems to be equivalent to the OEM Dewalt battery.So I am happy with this replacement battery.Enough words now?
4,ALREADY IN USE.,"I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE, THEY WORK GREAT AND ARE LONG LASTING, I WILL DEFINITELY BUY MORE WHEN NEEDED. THANKS"
2,Only fair quality,"Not as much power as the original battery, and doesn't hold charge as long. I bought this as a second battery - and although it says Black & Decker - it doesn't work as well as the old original battery."
4,Good battery,"After 5 years of minor home fixing, my B&D battery said goodbye. I have no complain on this new replacement battery. It gives me enough juice to do minor stuff in and around my house. It's a good buy. Thanks Amazon."
5,Replacement battery for cordless drill,"I do not use my drill all that often, but when I do I want it to perform properly.Old battery would not hold a charge. Drill ran slow. This replacement has brought it back to life!"
3,Black & decker battery,Battery is ok but not as powerful as I would like but will get get the job done.
5,Top grade manufacturer product for a fraction of the retail cost,"My older cordless drill needed a new battery. After shopping the usual local (Houston) places (Lowes, Best Buy, Ace), I tried an Internet search. I was delighted to find the battery at Amazon at a greatly reduced price and with my order for some DVDs there was no shipping costs. Thank you Amazon."
5,works with DeWalt drill,"I ordered two of these for my 15-year-old DeWalt 9.6v drill - they are virtually identical to the original batteries that came with the DeWalt, with the exception that there is a ""key"" molded into the B&D version that prevents it from sliding into the handle of the DeWalt. I filed a keyway in the right spot in the handle of the drill, and the batteries now fit just fine. This is a simple modification that takes about 3-5 minutes total and does not hurt either the drill or the battery - well worth it for the $$ saved versus buying the ""OEM"" version. Also, the batteries work with the DeWalt charger without modification to either."
5,Replacement battery,"Bought this to replace the origional battery that no longer held a charge. Charged easily, works very well giving my drill new life"
1,Doesn't fit my drill,"B&D replacement parts site indicated this was the proper replacement battery for my drill but the battery has a plastic tab at the base of it that prevents the battery from fitting into my drill. Unless I can exchange it, this will be a total waste of money."
4,"Good product, but. . .","It was nice to know I could purchase new batteries for a screwdriver ten years old. They both charged well and the packaging included a telephone number to call to recycle the old batteries. My beef with the product, however, is the packaging. I keep my pocket knife almost razor sharp and it would not open the packages. We ended up using a saber saw to get the packages open. Is all this packaging necessary? I think not. Lew"
4,Juice for you,Good product. One charging session and it was ready to go. I've used it for about a week on one charge and it still works and the price was right. Thanks Amazon.
4,Good fit for small areas,"Nice, 4 outlets, very compact for small areas and modest usage. I bought it for my wife's computerized Bernina sewing machine and the laptop she attaches to it. Just right and great price."
3,"Bad design, good overall product","THE GOOD: Seems to work well. Nice because I only need it to prevent quick outages, not power a big system during a big power failure.THE BAD: Crappy device design. The base of the device required RIGHT AFTER I bought it to be propped close using a folded up piece of paper to behave like a spring. I didn't drop it or mishandle it but when the battery was ajar in its housing, it would start to beep loudly.THE LAME: The loud beeping. No way to turn it off when the power is down apart from disabling the battery. Come on now, this is a cheap battery but I expect more from APC.CONCLUSION: Price is right and it does a pretty good job, despite annoyances."
1,A tribute?,"I have bought every Iron Maiden Tribute album I can get my hands on and so far they are all good except for this one. Overall it was a very major dissappointment. The lyrics as well as the music are very watered down and it seems that most of the album is just Paul trying to cover some of his former band's music, and not very successfully"
3,It could be worse.,"Basically, some interesting IDEAS, but it comes off as sounding like watered down, whiney wussy 80's cheese wanna be metal. Pansy singers."
5,An excellent survey of the subject,"The 1992 first edition of this book contains 27 short chapters covering the history of British Pullman services, from the 1880s to 190s. It is well-illustrated in monochrome photographs. The author is a respected railway historian, and the book is well-written, informative, and extremely readable."
5,The best corner detail sander on the market.,"I'm a professional cabinet maker and I put a lot of hours on the Bosch sander trough out the week. It is a great sander for getting into corners and detail work. This is my second one. My first one lasted about ten years and then stopped. I immediately got a new one. The new one is more powerful , quieter and smoother running."
3,Not to bad but not the best either,"It was rather easy to use but the sand paper did not last very long.. Over all, I would rate this tool a 3 on your scale of 5."
1,No Supplies,"I have a unit similar to this, uses the same pads, you sell the detail sander, but not the H&L sanding pads! What's with that?"
3,Site for the narrow (32mm) sandpaper,"There are 3 grits of narrow extender paper that I have found:SDNR060, SDNR080 and SDNR120. Try www.toolsforless.com andsearch on any of these 3 SKU numbers.All the best."
1,Disappointed,"After a few days of intermittent use, with an ""electrical burning"" smell the entire time, my unit stopped running. When I returned it to my dealer, he had replaced another unit with the same problem, using his last Bosch in stock. After reading that others are also having similar problems, I switched to Fein."
4,Detail Corner Sander,"This tool does a nice job, but it is hard to find sand paper for for the narrow extender attachment. I have been looking for about six months. The standard triangle paper is very available."
2,Designed well but problems with electrical,"I love the Bosch line of tools, I need a very dependable detail sander and I am still hoping that Bosch will be the sander, I have bought three detail sanders from Bosch, two of which have failed after just a few hours of which each I smell electrical odor before they fail, I will take this last one back and get another one shipped, but there is deffinately a flaw with the electrical, probably the brushes, I was hoping others may have had the same problem??? Again I love the design but there is an electrical problem where they simply stop and just after a few hours of use, I believe in Bosch and will try again, Home Depot here we come!Respectfully Dwight"
4,Scrubbing Kit Does the Job,"I am pleased with this hard-to-find accessory for the Mouse. The scrubbing pads are great for heavy duty cleaning jobs - I even used them to remove the top coat of latex paint on some furniture without disturbing the bottom coat. Try that with sandpaper! My only complaint is as the other person stated - why would they adhere the loop backing with a water-soluble glue? And why would they apply a loop backing to everything but the white pad? Nevertheless, they performed well for the intended (and unintended) tasks and I give them four out of five stars."
1,BROKEN,"I received this the day I was going on vacation, got back today and opened it, and its freaking broken. Now Amazon says they arent going to exchange it. Tisk Tisk Tisk. (insert expletive here)"
4,Not Virgil or Homer but OK,"Quintus was no Homer and no Virgil, but a good read just the same. Alan James translation into early 21st century English is excellent and makes the story readable for enjoyment not just as a literary duty. If you are tired of reading your classics in 18th and 19th century style this will be refreshing."
3,"Great Saw, terrible battery!","I purchased this to remove cedar siding for trimming exterior windows and doors. It performed well, albeit the factory battery is virtually useless. DeWalt 14.4 batteries fit the B&D although not perfectly. The lock tabs on the Dewalt batteries are slightly shorter so you need to finagle them a bit. Once locked, you're good to go with power to spare. Bottom line, for the money this is an excellent little saw if you already own a DeWalt 14.4 tool which enables you to interchange the batteries. Otherwise, the money you thought you saved on the saw itself will certainly be spent buying aftermarket batteries and a one hour charger to make the tool usuable. BTW, it comes with a 14 tooth carbide blade which cuts well."
2,No Power,"I bought the firestorm circular saw because I already owned the 14.4 Volt drill (which is a great product). The design of the saw is good. It is easy to make straight cuts. The flaw it the saw is the lack of power. The battery runs down quickly. The battery dies after cutting about 12 feet of 3/4 inch partical board, then needs to charge for 3 hours. Luckly I have two batteries which came with my drill and the one which came with the saw. Even so, I am unable to complete a project without long delays charging batteries. The engineers who designed this saw were not thinking too well when they coupled it with a 14.4 volt battery. Were they intentionally trying to jip me or were they just stupid. The saw would be just fine for cutting a board or two, but running out of power every five minutes is a little lame. I will nowhave to go out and buy another saw just to complete my project. I'm very disapointed.."
3,Quiet Your Mind Book,This was recommended by a friend..... I can understand why she enjoyed it so much. Me - not so much.
3,"Read the great reviews, but","I was disappointed. The stereo effect in games is disconcerting, with noise directionality being 'off'. For example, when driving a tank in BF2 (straight forward) the engine noise is obviously slanted to the right. If I turned to the left slightly, the engine noise would come to 'center' then settle back to the right as I straightened out.I found these uncomfortable to wear for over 30 minutes as well. I do have a large head (go ahead, yuck it up, I always take the largest motorcycle helmet size) so that might have something to do with it...The microphone worked very well, with minimal background noise interference."
5,A Darn Good Headset.,"I've had this headset for about a year, and my review is that the sound quality, especially when playing music, is very good. I haven't had many sets of headsets, but these will whip any lower-priced headsets, obviously because you're getting what you paid for. Sounds are crisp, loud, and during games, people won't sneak up behind you if you're paying attention.The microphone quality is just as good as the speakers. The noise cancelling makes for a very crisp, clear conversation.The only problem I've seen develop is that the headset itself makes the inside of my right ear rather hyper-sensitive to touch (painful). Of course, this is after wearing them continuously for 5 hours or more due to the humidity that the headset holds while you game or listen to music. My reccomendation is to take a 20 minute break after a few hours of playing and you will be fine."
3,"Nice sound quality, but they hurt my ears.","I use these for Skype teleconferences and World of Warcraft. While the audio quality of the mic is great and the headphones is quite good, the pressure on my ears makes them unbearable to wear after an hour. I'm tempted to just wear them around my neck to use the mic and plug in $10 earphones for my longer meetings."
5,Danzig 3,This is a very good cd. It has a raw guitar sound that reminds me of Black sabbath. Every Track is good!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Buy for the Price,"I do really like the lamp. The only suggestion that I would have to the distributor would be to package the product a little better. I received the lamp mostly in good condition. The finial was broken on one part. I was, although, easily able to super glue the piece back on. I loathe having to repackage and return items. All in all, I really like the lamp. The size and color are a great compliment to my room."
3,Cute But Small,"These lamps are cute but kind of small. If I had to do it all over again, I would probably just purchase some (larger) lamps from a local store. It's so hard to know what you are getting when looking online."
3,Alright,"Wish my professor didn't make us use this book. It needs more examples, but it's pretty helpful other than that."
5,British Babes are randier than a sailor on shore leave,"This is a great playboy DVD featuring very shagable british page three girls. Hosted by Zoe doing her topless Austin Powers impersonation (hot girl, cheesy intros), this has about 8 or so british models first talking about sexual situations in a very candid way (not like a phone sex line)then posing for a few minutes. If you like British women talking dirty before they pose, then get this. If you only like the airbrushed silicon look, look elsewhere (that's not to say they're all totally natural here). I loved it! If you liked Millennium Calendar Girls, get this also. Faves are the hostess (pity she didn't pose a bit more), Jo Guest, Anouk,Donna Ewin (from the Fast Show) and Adele stephens in a cameo."
2,It could have been better ...,"I found this DVD to be average in comparison to some of Playboy's other DVDs. Somewhat different setup here, where each girl would be interviewed for 2 or 3 minutes, and then it would show her video segment. Unfortunately when you add up 2 or 3 minutes of talking for each girl, it was about 20-25 minutes of talking that really didn't need to be there.There were some pretty good looking girls. Joanna Guest was probably the most well-known model that I recognized, and there were some pretty good video segments, especially by Anouk near the swimming pool.But for me, there was just way more talking here than I've seen in any other Playboy DVD. I prefer the way that the Video Calendars are setup, where you hear a 30 second voiceover as each video segment begins. It's not the case here, so be forewarned.It's worth a rental, but I wouldn't buy it."
4,Innocent fun,"Like the Austin Powers movies that inspired them, this DVD has a brief collection of British (we are told) babes that are hot and sexy in an innocent way. This is good, relatively wholesome fun."
3,PLAYBOY BRITISH BABES,"THIS IS COLLECTION OF GIRLS FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM, I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND A BRITISH ACCENT VERY SEXY, THE GIRLS ARE PRETTY AND THERE IS FULL NUDITY BUT I THINK THEY SPENT TOO MUCH TIME WITH INTERVIEWSRANDY"
2,The worst DVD I ever had,No Playmates and the girls aren't too pretty. I expect them at least like Playmates but... I guess I'm wrong
4,The Best Deal on Refills for the Mouse Sander/Polisher,"This looks like the best deal in replacement accessories for the sander polisher. I find that I have to buy replacement sandpaper (especially the fine grit) more often (separate package). I tried putting together my own sandpaper, but after the cost of the velcro and the imperfect fit, I went back to the B&D accessories."
2,sandpaper,"If you own the sanders that require this paper...I have several...then you have to have it. My suggestion... Go to a Black and Decker Outlet Store... We have one in Seaside Oregon. Price? 3 packs for 5.00 - Fine, Medium, or an assortment available. 3 for $5 is the regular price. All I usually need is the paper although the scrubbing pad included in some packages has been useful, especially for scrubbing pool coping."
4,Budget Scope for BB or Plinker 22,"If your budget minded this is a good scope. It's construction is aluminum tube, aluminum mount, plastic bezels, plastic caps and a plastic adjustment for focusing.Initialy I looked through it and noticed I had to adjust the focus. As I adjusted the focus my view became more sharp and detailed as I could read letters clearly with it. As I adjusted there developed a ghost ring or a bubbling effect. The ghost ring makes it difficult to view through the scope.Appears I have to give up clarity for ease of use. I cannot say for sure what the cause is but my understanding lets me think that the lenses may not be aligned properly...the surfaces the lenses sit on may be not parallel to each other.Best maybe to be used on a bb or plinker 22. If you got a target 22 this is not the scope."
2,bought two of these and one broke first time out.,The lens inside broke free on one of them and the other still worked so I guess it's hit and miss.
2,Worked for a while,"If you intend to do any shooting whatsoever, this is not the scope for you. Upon installation, one of the mounting screws began to twist out. After twenty or so shots, the cheap plastic retainer on the front objective lens actually snapped in two. Without this retainer the sight became utterly useless. I am dead certain the scope never stuck anything, but rather it broke from simply firing my low powered target gun. If you look at how flimsy the parts are on this scope it will be obvious just how long it will last. Don't throw your money away. Spend five bucks more for something better."
4,Its ok,"This is a pretty good scope. I use it alot, most of the time. I had bought this scope from another sight and i recommened it. If it does not work for you dont blame me. This is just my thought."
1,Very very basic info,if you know anything about dogs you don't need this book. about ten pages on VERY basic training. Not worth buying set in 60' or 70s
3,It lives up to when it was published.,A good book..... for the 70's Doberman trainer. It wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped for. I'm not sorry I bought it though.
5,Amazing Purchase:,I read through reviews on all the bodums and other manufacturers. Purchased the Frieling for the dual-walled quality and the fact that I didn't have to worry about breaking a glass insert or removing one.Result:Easy to cleanNo StainsGood coffeeNo plunger problemsWarm for hoursCan't be happier. Buying their milk frother because I plan on having this piece for life.
4,Excellent Coffee,My husband loves coffee made with this French press. It does keep the coffee hot for a while. He says this makes about 2 1/2 mugs (most coffee cups hold more than 8oz.)
4,Excellent--just not 5-6 cups,"Keeps the coffee hot, I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about, but after 5 min of brewing you still must be careful to not burn yourself.Beautiful design, seems to look good anywhere.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is no where near 5 to 6 cups. It is 25oz including the area used by the plunger and coffee grounds. Even the directions refer to a cup being 6 oz which would make this a 4 cup press at best. If you and your partner drink a large mug each than this press isn't big enough."
5,A great cup of coffee,Love this French press. Had coffee at a restaurant in Napa and love it then and am enjoying a cup daily. Bought different sizes at CIA before learning of this larger 33 to 42 ounce . Christmas presents for the family who also enjoy a great cup of coffee.
3,Beautiful and disappointing,"I purchased one of these luxury Frieling french presses in 28oz size. Upon arrival I first noticed how beautiful it looks. It certainly feels quality and has a bit of weight giving it a hefty feel. I immediately made coffee and noticed that the top half of the carafe gives more friction than the bottom half allowing coffee grounds to escape the filter into the cup. I am certain this is a manufacturing defect, and much disappointed at the quality control of the process that gives the interior its brushed metal look.Something to note is that while the company website states Frieling products are manufactured in Germany, the one I received was made in China."
2,"Beautiful, but Does Not Keep Coffee Hot","I'm so disappointed with this french press. I preheat the press with hot water, and brew the coffee for 5 minutes. The Bodum stainless steel press I have then pours coffee that is piping hot. I bought the Frieling press for my office because I thought it was so great looking. I'm just baffled by the fact that the coffee is lukewarm after 5 minutes. It seems that a lot of air can escape from the spout. The Bodum lid is designed to block air from escaping through the spout. The Frieling lid is not. No one else has mentioned this problem in their review, so I'm confused. It seems like a huge design flaw."
1,frieling french press review,"I am rather disappointed in this pot. It does not keep the coffee any hotter and now that I have used it for a month, the fit of the plunger has loosened and I get coffee grounds in my coffee. Overall, I would not purchase another one. The only positive is that it is pretty to look at."
1,I am VERY unhappy,"I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend to replace his Nissan which was falling apart after many years of daily service. I wanted to get him something a little nicer looking - am I ever sad I did. Although it does make good coffee, after only 4 uses, we are unable to get the filter asembly back together. I have written to the manufacturer to have them replace it, but no luck.I would recomend the Nissan or the Bodum stainless steel, which I have used for years without any problems."
2,NOT 5-6 cups,"I think the design is beautiful, but this is NOT a 5-6 cup coffee press.5-6 espressos, maybe. 5-6 cups coffee, NO.It measures out to be 3 cups of liquid, if filled to the brim (no grinds).It makes 2 cups of coffee.PLEASE STOP LISTING IT AS 5-6 CUPS OF COFFEE!!!!!"
5,We kept breaking our glass ones,"We have broken four French press coffee makers in 6 years of marriage, and we are delighted to have found one that (should be) indestructible! It also keeps the coffee *very* warm."
4,Nice Design,"I got fed up with breaking the glass carafes of my Bodum french press. I bought this one so I would never worry again. And I haven't. So there. It's stylish and it works great. Buy it. The one small criticism I have is that the handle of mine is soldered on about 3mm crooked. Makes no functional difference, and nobody notices (except me of course)."
4,Keeps coffee hot,Have a glass French press and was always worried about breaking the glass. The key to good FP coffee is to pre heat the vessel with hot water before you make coffee. I gave 4 stars because unless the coffee is at the perfect consistency it either is too hard to press or you get grounds in the coffee.This will probably last forever.
1,Unacceptable due to metal taste,"Bought this item to replace a 5 year old glass bodum when it broke. Mine was also ""made in PRC"".Washed it well, made two pots of coffee and the coffee tasted of metal both times.I believe the very tight fit of the metal plunger screen against the metal interior wall of the press caused metal to be ""shaved"" off. The scratching sound it made when plunged was horrible, and plunging took much more force than my glass bodum. A final clean and wipe down of the inside walls with a white paper towel revealed heavy grey staining - I'm sure it was metal.Perhaps this would break in over time and stop tasting of metal but I don't want to drink metal until then. So I'm returning it."
3,Frieling 5-6 Cup French Press,"Bought this thinking it would be great for keeping coffee hot. It is good at keeping the coffee hot BUT it is not such a great press. First off, it holds only TWO mug size cups of coffee. When you press the coffee, you have to be very careful or the hot coffee will come shooting out the spout. There is no filter over the pour spout so the coffee can get pretty muddy. My other two glass presses have a filter and work great. Lastly I think the value for the money is very poor. Too much money for a press that doesn't hold very much, shoots coffee out the spout and makes muddy coffee."
2,"Lovely design, smaller than expected","I really thought this french press would be larger. Although it is rated at 25 ounces, we actually only get 1-1/2 normal sized coffee mugs of coffee from it! Our coffee mugs measure 9 ounces so I am not sure where the 25 ounce capacity came from! I recommend this press for a single person who wants just a cup and a half of coffee in the morning!It is insulated and does keep the coffee hot but given the small capacity there is no need to keep it hot! I can drink a cup and a half of coffee before it would get cold for goodness sake!"
5,This Rocks!,Great quality and looks. This is made very well and keeps coffee hot long enough for you to finish. It is attractive and very solid and heavy. I highly recommend
5,Excellent product!!!,"I bought this after trying French pressing with a cheap wal-mart glass one first cause I wasn't sure about the quality change in the flavor of my coffee. I was convinced after one try. I then gave away my glass one wanting a real nice press. I then researched for presses on amazon. I was torn between the Bodum and this one. I went this way mainly due to the fact that this one was not glass and would mbe much more durable over time. Construction is solid. No handles to break. My only complaint is that is does dribble one single drop down the front just like pouring wine. I'm not even sure that's avoidable though and very minor compared to the outstanding build quality. I highly recommend this press and I'm sure I'll enjoy if for years knowing it won't break in the sink, dishwasher or transporting it.EDIT: Still own this a year later and LOVING IT! :)"
3,Made in China.,"Would be a 5-star rating, but the unit I received has a pinhole in a weld so it is not vacuum sealed. Didn't bother returning it because I am not concerned with keeping the beverage hot for a longer period of time. Other than that, it's attractive, functional, durable and feels good in the hand. No more broken Bodum glass presses for me. 5-6 cups is a classic European cup, for me and my American supersized caffeine addiction, I get about two cups."
4,Best Value French Press,"I recently ordered an additional Frieling french press as a gift for a friend. The new press was highly polished and very similar to the old press. However, when you compare the old press (purchased in 2003) to the new press (purchased in 2012) you can see a definite difference in the quality of construction. The older press has a much higher quality mesh filter (3 parts) and plunger construction. The new press plunger parts seem to be thinner gauge stamped metal (like you find in many $25 bodum or similar presses). It seems that Frieling has followed every other manufacturer in the world and cheapened the product in order to keep the price the same. Even so, this is still the best press available for the price.** If you are looking to replace an older Frieling, I would suggest keeping the filter parts from your old press (since that seems to be where the quality has been sacrificed) and using just the plunger and carafe from the new press."
3,Elegant but it's a 3 cupper,"If you like an elegant looking press, this is it. Personally, I'm more into function. Particles of coffee grounds tend to escape from the press, and it's capacity is only about 3 cups. Where the manufacturer comes up with 5-6 cups, I don't know. Must be puny demitasse cups. I was used to our glass press which was a 4 cupper."
3,Frieling Stainless Steel 35oz coffee press,I bought my parents the Freiling 5-6 cup ss press and prefer it. This one - the 35oz press - doesn't keep the coffee as hot as the other and the lid slides off easily.
4,what a difference all stainless makes!!!!,"Wow I've had this press now for about a week, and I LOVE it! I was using a 32oz bodum stainless steel French press with a plastic plunger that I've had for years. The taste of the brew out of this Frieling is pure java now no bitterness. I didn't realize how the much better the coffee is with the all stainless steel construction. I would have given this thing a five star but i think the handle could be a little thicker for easier puring, and i wish it wasn't made in china. All in all it's great. Built well enough to last for a life time."
5,Outstanding thermal press,Excellent quality made coffee press... Keeps coffee warm and is durable...no fear of glass shattering...Quality materials...no plastic on the press filter like other cheaper products...all polished metalHighly recommended
4,Should avoid endless carafe breaking,"I like the coffee produced by ""french press"" coffee pots, but I don't like the fact that now and then the glass carafe breaks. The Frieling pot makes coffee that is comparable to any other french press pot that I have used, and I hope that it will prove much more durable than the glass carafe models. So far, so good"
5,Great Press,My husband has always tended to break our glass coffee presses. Now we have found one that will not break and keeps our coffee hotter than ever before. We love our new stainless press!
5,awesome french press,"I broke my glass Bodum French Press 4 weeks after buying it. So,I ordered this stainless steel Frieling French Press. WOW! Beautiful, feels nice to hold. GREAT tight press. delicious coffee. Durable.We are buying another one as a wedding gift and having it engraved.Can't go wrong! GREAT gift too."
5,"Works Great, No complain.","Works Great, No complain. No need to worry about the glass breaking issue. Should get this one in the first place."
5,Frieling Stainless French Press,"I really do like the Frieling Stainless French Press. It has a nice solid weight to the handle and press mechanism. It has a great balance so you don't feel like it will tip and pores the coffee without dribbling. I am confused however about the description stating a 33 to 42 oz. press. Perhaps in the manufacturing the pot comes out less than uniform each time, thus the variation. My press will hold 40 ounces if I fill it to the very top and don't add any coffee. But what's the point in that??? I've used cheaper stainless models, this is far superior and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends or foe. Thank-you for the great coffee : ]"
2,dirt water,"I am sorry I do not agree witht the other reviews I don't know what hey are smoking!!!. Maybe if I got a lemon but this makes THE WORST coffee I have EVER had in my whole entire life. I have two coffee grinders and It does not matter which one I use(both conical burr)the Breville of the Nuova Simonelli at the coarse max setting, the results are terrible. The filter is not tight enough, and the mesh holes are too big to catch the coffee grind. You will end up running through paper filter afterwards. I have just completelly wasted my money on this expensive (but good looking) dirt water maker."
2,"Nice, but doesn't hold the heat","I love the look of this pot, but I ordered it primarily because I thought it would keep the coffee hotter than my glass french press. It only stays warm for around 30 minutes. I still have to transfer the coffee into my thermal coated carafe to hold the heat for my late rising spouse, so it didn't save me any steps."
5,Excellent,"Have had the frieling 5-6(european)cup press for a few weeks now and so far it is excellent.Not a tinge of regret,not even over the price.I'm even thinking about buying the next size up for weekends and the next size down for late afternoons.It is well made and easy to use.I'm a little particular(ok nutty) about saving grounds for the garden/yard so I need to find a better spatula for scooping.Maybe silicon?"
5,Makes the best coffee ever,"This French press coffee maker makes the best coffee I've ever had, and my wife and I are crazy about good coffee. I have had mine for more than a year, and it is just like brand-new because it is built like a tank. We even carry it with us on trips, because coffee made any other way does not compare. I do not know if the glass French press coffee makers make the same quality of coffee, but it is obvious that they would not last as long.Update: Almost 5 years later with daily use it still works and makes the best coffee. UPDATE 6 years later: In 2013 it Still looks and works like brand new, I keep trying other coffee brewers, K cups etc but nothing compares. This is the best french press and a real investment as it lasts forever."
2,Grounds in the coffee every time,"We've had the Frieling French Press for 3 weeks now, and we get grounds in the coffee every single time. There appears to be some sort of engineering/manufacturing problem with the plunger/press mechanism that allows a stream of hot water to come shooting up as you press down. Over and above getting grounds in the coffee, my wife got scalded pretty badly.Yes, one can minimize the grounds in the coffee if you tilt the pot back and don't fill it very high, but for the amount we paid, I shouldn't have to do that. We never had this type of problem with our previous Bodum presses (they broke because they are glass, but that's a different issue).I will say that the thermos feature of this pot does seem to work well, but that's not enough to compensate for the press issue. I guess we'll try the Bodum now."
5,Really Nice French Press,"We bought this so that we could have an unbreakable French press. The bonus is that it is insulated. When it arrived, I was impressed by the quality and heft of the press. It is a great size for two people, and first try it pressed and pour beautifully. Not a drip from the spout! One note is to not overfill the press when brewing. You are better off under filling a bit and then adding some more water after the initial press. Also, try getting your coffee ground between the press grind and that for a cone filter, and then plunging the press right away. You'll end up with smooth and well extracted coffee!!"
4,"As advertised, nice style.","After cracking yet another Bodum glass French Press, I opted for the Frieling this time around. Great product - love the style, build quality, and the insulation. Really only one complaint, which is that I hate the sound/feel of metal on metal as I push the plunger down. But once that's over, it's all upside. I can envision using the pitcher portion to mix up cocktails this summer, too!"
3,size,"AFTER HOURS OF RESEARCH OVER DAYS. NOTE; there is a 25 oz and a 35 oz. I think the reviews are mixed here. I just bought the 25 oz, which i believe is actually 23 oz because YOU CANNOT FILL IT UP OR YOU GET GRINDS and spillage, for $48 from the amazon warehouse."
3,All Hype..!,"Few months back I decided to ditch my GE coffee maker and go for ""Aerobie 80R08 AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker."" It might look similar to a French Press coffe maker, but it is different. I was very satisfied with my purchase since the coffee tasted much better than the regular coffee maker. Everyone in the family liked the taste.However, with Aero press I could make only a single serving of coffee at a time. If I put more coffee powder it is very difficult to press.So last week, I bought this French Press type coffee press. This unit looks very good, well made, works smoothly, and I could make 3-serving of coffee at a time. However, I am disappointed with the coffee taste. It tastes only slightly better than a regular coffee maker. It is a far cry from the ""Aerobie 80R08 AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker."""
3,Pressing sounds like fingernails on chalkboard,"I just received this French press and it's very well crafted. It's replacing a Bodum that breaks too easily.One major drawback is for those who are sensitive to metal on metal scraping sounds. Pressing this thing sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard! The inside of the press does not have the same shiny finish as the outside, which I think would help dramatically."
2,not worth the money,"I have owned french presses for over 40 years, This is the only one I have owned that you have to fill it 3/4 full. If you don,t you will have hot coffee everywhere, plus grounds in your cup, and if your unlucky 3rd degree burns. Got it on sale for $55 dollars and change, looks great and thats it. wont keep coffee hot for second cup . So much for insulation !Buy a cheap one that works."
3,French Press,"THis product is nice looking but average quality, however, Amazon sells one called Nissan Thermos coffee press that is out of this world and very chic setting on your desk! Price wise cheaper than this one and on sale right now for $29.00! Check it out!!! I own two and all my friends that love coffee have one! Great way to have your own pot of coffee on your desK!"
5,Perfect,"I absolutely love this press. For starters, it is super sturdy. I'm always afraid of the glass ones breaking. I've heard plenty of stories about them shattering randomly when plunging the grounds. Not a problem with this one. You could chunk it the ground if you wanted to. It's double walled and they claim it'll keep your coffee hot longer. It's true. Just make sure to preheat it with some warm water before adding the coffee and the water you're brewing with."
4,It's OK...,"I bought this approx. 1 month ago.Coffee stays nice and hot.Only complaint is that there is not a strainer built into the spout, so I do get alot of coffee grounds in my cup! : XI have started straining it into a mesh strainer that I place over the cup before I pour the coffee.I previously owned a BODUM Glass French Press and did not have this problem with the Bodum.I wanted a Steel press as I did not want to have breakage and I wanted the insulating benefits.It works, but I wish I'd have known how much grounds end up in the cup prior to my purchase."
5,Frieling USA Ultimo Stainless-Steel French Press-35 ounce,"I bought this French press because I was tired of paying a lot of money to replace broken glass carafes. This press has the same three-layer ""press"" found in the Bodum French presses, cleans easily, works the same way as the Bodum and is insulated to keep coffee warm. It is heavy and a gorgeous piece!I did hesitate due to the price. But now I have no regrets. I would highly recommend this French Press to anyone who likes a basic French press, as an alternate to the Bodum -- particularly if you do not want to deal with the glass carafe, and the insulation is a bonus!The 35-ounce gives me two big mugs of coffee."
1,Plunger threads are stripped after 3 months,"Makes coffee great, stays hot, but the plunger threads are stripped after only 3 months!! The handle is noticeably attached crooked and has sloppy welding, but I decided to overlook that.. though most of the appeal is in the streamlined design so go figure. Fingerprints do show up a lot on the mirror finish (it is pretty to look at, but perhaps not so practical). Very disappointed about the plunger not working and now I have to see if its covered by warranty or can be returned. Very expensive for low quality item."
3,MADE IN CHINA AND IT FEELS LIKE IT,"The press is as nicely polished as described but it is not 18/8 Stainless, the inside is not polished and the plunger feels rough when you push it. Otherwise it is French press only by design and I expect problems from the very poor quality plunger grille; compare it with Alessi and you will see the difference in feel and finish.The taste: the taste is the same as any French Press but it does stay warm longer."
5,Top of the Line!,"I love this press! It is a very sophisticated French press that is ideal for elegant entertaining or everyday sipping. It really produces a rich, full-bodied brew and the press features an insulated stainless-steel carafe that keeps coffee hot for hours. A mesh filter keeps sediment out of your cup!Addendum:I've owned this press for over one year and have to say this thing is amazing. It's built like a tank. This is a fantastic buy for anyone who takes their coffee seriously."
5,"Daily, I am reminded of how satisfied I am with this purchase.","I find myself using this thing 2-3 times a day, for coffee, yerba mate, and various loose herbal teas. It is perfect for my partner and I to enjoy hot tea!After losing two glass french presses to eventual ""accidents"" and, mind you, we are careful people, we decided maybe we should look at alternatives. At first, I was a little regretful over spending 80-something dollars on one fancy item, but the use I get out of it is well worth it. I also no longer fear it randomly cracking and leaving me without good tea/coffee for a week or so.Overall, I would say if you are agonizing over whether or not to purchase this one, go for it. You can take it camping, and it is completely stainless steel, even the filter inside. I know this will last me a very long time, and I will try to give an update in a year or so on how this thing has held up."
2,"Heavy, Overpriced. Wish I had got another Bodum.","This sounded good and has decent reviews(???). I needed to replace a Bodum and figured it costs more it's gotta be at least as good if not better. Turns out I was wrong. First off, it's incredibly heavy. If you're weak or getting on in years you may have trouble lifting this even before you've poured the water in. It makes washing it tiring. Next the construction - The carafe itself is good, but the plunger has some issues. Its tight but not smooth. Compared to a Bodum its terrible. The metal piece that holds the filter on has sharp edges. Sharp enough to cut you, watch out when washing it. Operating the plunger feels rough and requires more force than the average Bodum. It causes coffee to squirt up frequently even when being careful.This is better than a cheap press but pales in comparison to even a $20 Bodum. Do yourself a favour and buy two Bodums instead."
5,classic straightforward reggae,Dennis Brown has (in my opinion) the perfect reggae voice. i've really enjoyed this set and definately recommend it to others
5,The Definitive Guide to Skiing and 'Boarding this Region,"The author sets out to offer a comprehensive guide to the highlights of skiing and snowboarding the Mid Atlantic. He succeeds thoroughly, presenting the right info in a highly readable, yet matter of fact style. Packed with tons of useful data and pointers, the book is hard to put down, yet easy enough to throw into a backpack or dufflebag before hitting the slopes. A must have for the Eastern winter sportsman."
4,Real Taoism,"The realm of Taoism has many facets and secular practices. In this select translation of various texts, Cleary attempts to make it very clear what the true goal of Taoism is. The texts distinguish between various practices and their goals. There are practices that specifically deal with health and energy. Others deal with obtaining ""powers."" The Texts make it clear that real toaism is the practice of ""observing mind."" In the end, the reader finds that what has been translated is very similar to Zen Buddhism. The only difference is the use of Taoist terms such as ""mysterious pass"", ""lead and mercury"", etc. A reader should be aware that this book is not a book that a reader can read and use the insights in his or her own life. It remains an educational presentation for the ""uneducated"" in the area of Taoism"
2,Not so special,"I've read so many other Photoshop books that actually help you become more creative by simply explaining everything to you in a more creative manner. Creative Thinking in Photoshop really didn't do much for me because it felt like I wasn't learning anything new. Also, as much as the authoer was trying to make it seem like she was narrating to you what she was doing step by step, I needed more screenshots to see what she was doing rather than have to visualize it myself.I finished this book in just a few days because it was easy reading but also a little too easy for my liking because a lot of the things she spoke about was something you'd find in almost any other photoshop book. The only difference here is that shes an artist talking about technical stuff rather than technical people talking about technical stuff."
2,whatever.,Nice enough little book - but very very thin on usable content. It's doubtful i will ever open this book again after the initial scan through it.
1,Wasted money,"Not at all what I thought I was getting, no how to's at all in the book and way to much reading, wanted more click by click instructions"
2,OVER PRICED,This book is decent for what it has BUT i felt a little ripped off spending 60 bucks for a used book that was half the size of books half the price. on the back of the book it even says 13.95$ US too and somehow this book is now 100+$?
5,the dirty dozen,"this new joint from low down is telling everybody whats up. All of their song are sicc their representing to the fullest Merced, CA. you got to buy this cd"
5,When Dad Hurts Mom,This book is great for Clinicians and Educators! I recommend that every domestic violence agency have one available for employees.
5,BOOK CAME AS STATED,"THIS CAME EARLY and in the CONDITION STATED. I've read one other book by him and it was excellent. He got to the bottom of the mens lies and garbage and wasn't buffaloed by their excuses, etc. Many women need to read his book ""Why Does He DO That? Inside the Minds of ANGRY and COntrolling Men"". My word processing is poor to fair because I have carpal tunel in both hands."
5,"For those new to the subject, it is great!","I work in a family violence prevention agency and hear women frequently say, ""He treats me horribly but he's a great dad."" This book uses research and 16 years experience to show how children raised in this environment are negatively affected by the abuse and that the abuser is not a ""great dad."" The author focuses less on the overt abuse and more on the atmosphere created by the dynamics of abuse with the effects on children. It is a wonderful guide for people debating whether or not to leave and how to mitigate the effects of the abuse for those who choose not to leave."
3,"Very difficult to assemble, but sturdy and looks nice","This item was nicely packaged, however took my husband a while to assemble it. It is definitely a two person job. Some of the ""wood"" was chipping off the inside of the door. Once together though it looks nice, especially when there is stuff in it. Three stars just for the difficult assembly, otherwise a decent piece."
5,Classic Rock and Roll With a Modern Twist,From the first time I listened to Tuesday and Thursdays I loved it. The harmony of brothers Paulie Z and David Z is unique. Two of my favorites songs are Radio and Fly On Your Wings. This is the kind of good time rock n roll I grew up with. And now ZO2 keeps the tradition alive with this CD. Rock on!
5,Izzy and Georg,These are the only frisbee that my dogs DO NOT chew up. The last one I had lasted 3 yrs. That's a long tome with a Labrador and MinPin.
1,Not Mac compatable,No printer driver exists to run this machine from a Mac. This should be stated clearly; there is no such statement in the specification. Amazon must now be responsible for return shipping of this very heavy item.
1,Piece Of Chinese Junk,I have used a Model#FS350 Type1 (made in the U.K.)(Blue case) for a number of years and the only problem experienced is a bad on/off switch. I installed a jumper on the switch & it is still working. I purchased a Model#7448 (Black case - Made in China) to have as a backup and it broke down on the third time I used it. The motor runs but the pad doesn't vibrate. Another quality? product from China!!! Both units appear identical (inside & out) except for color and point of manufacture.
2,Paper Falls Off 2005!,"I wonder if there's something wrong with the clamps on a batch of these. We bought this a couple years ago and never really used it much. Just started trying to use it in earnest this evening and I will add my ""paper falls off"" woes to the group.I tried about ten times with a number of different types of sandpaper - it seems that the clamps tighten down when you pull up on the lever, but in order to lock the levers into place they ""relax"" just a little bit and the paper doesn't hold in place well. Just a tiny bit of sideways motion and yep, paper starts to slide right off...Sounds like they've had this model forever - maybe it's time the old B&D; spent some money on R&D; and upgraded their product a little bit.Looks like it goes on the garage sale pile and it's time to try out another..."
2,Good sander but wastes sandpaper,"I like the feel of this sander and want to use it for finish work. It is advertised as a 1/3 sheet sander, meaning you should be cross-able to cut three pieces 9"" long from a 9 x 11 stock sheet of sandpaper.The sandpaper isn't long enough. I even have some sheets from Norton that are 9-1/8""+ long and they walk off the sander.So to use this thing I have to cut the paper from the length wise direction and so I only get 2 pieces of paper I can use.Effectively it wastes 1/3 of your sandpaper."
4,Works for me,"For someone who only uses a sander on an occasional basis and for very common tasks, this product is a very cost effective solution. I can understand why it would not be fit for everyone, but for the non-critical use I'm involved with this is a good solution. I've had no problem with the sandpaper staying put."
1,Do not waste your time or money on this sander,The paper will not stay on! I repeat. The paper will not stay on. Spend more and get a product that does what it was intended to do. This product does not!
5,"high durablity, ergonomic and practical.","Dear supllierThat have high durablity, ergonomic and practical. I am very happy with article. Its important.thanks friendsWilber Legonia"
3,"Works ok, but the paper slips.","The sander works fine, but the paper tends to slip out while sanding. You can fix this by putting an extra small sheet of paper behind the sanding sheet on each end. I should send it back, but I'm in the middle of a project so I probably won't."
2,Just me....I guess,"I have sanded thousands of square feet of wood over the years and have/had never used 1/3 sheet type and I really don't like it. I don't like the way the sandpaper is held in and I don't like all of the measuring to make sure you get the right size exactly. Also, I don't think that it's as efficient as palm sanders with much more waste."
3,on/off button issues,"Sander works great when I can get the ""on"" button to stay on. It takes some playing with to keep it going.Changing paper is easy."
4,My review,I think this CD/cassette is great but I loved Book of Secrets better but this is fine too. The instruments and her singing is the best.
4,nice music,"It is very nice , but unfortunately I could not find this song`s text. I think , it is a good idea to put it in reach every one easily. and help me to find your songs text.best for you ."
3,mixed emotions,"On one hand, there's the opening track, All Soul's Night, which, along with Courtyard Lullaby, and The Old Ways makes for a very, very good album.On the other hand, there's bland boring aweful songs like Bonny Portmore and The Lady of Shallott.... Both of those would be very good, if she would SING a SONG, rather than speaking in a musical tone of voice, like the priests of my church are prone to.All in all, I was disappointed. Maybe you won't be, I know people who have wept outright at the sound of The Lady of Shallott, but if you're anything like me you will. Still, the cd's worth buying, but I'd put it rather low on a list of must-haves"
3,Not Really Worth the Visit,"Loreena Mckennitt's the Visit is not as good or original as her next two albums the Mask and mirror and the Book of Secrets.The music is mediocre and lyrics wise some of the songs are a bit boring.The Lady of Shalott(all eleven minutes and five seconds)is just not as good as another song she based on a poem,the Highwayman from Book of Secrets.Courtyard Lullaby and Cymbeline are weak and should not have been made into songs in the first place.I liked the instermental Between the Shadows but Tango to Evora is nothing new.The song Greensleeves is her worst song and the way she sings it is awful.The best songs are All Souls Nights(one of her best songs)Bonny Portmore and The Old Ways.The Visit is not a terrible album,but after listening to her other albums (including her earlier recording)I feel this should be better."
2,Listening Once is Enough,"Alot of people gave such glowing reviews to this so I bought it and listened. My positive comments is that she has a nice singing voice. A number of the songs use a repeating verse/refrain format that I found to repetitive and boring. After listening to it I immedietely put it away and have no desire to listen to it again. A number of the songs have a lot of words, but if it weren't for the lyrics included I'd have no idea what she was saying. Some compare her to Enya, but Enya's latest album is worlds above this in variety and appeal. From reading her CD notes and listen and reading the lyrics, she seems to have a foundness for yearing for a pre-Christian world (pagan). Which tells me immedietly that she knows very little about the pre-Christian world and even less about Christianity."
1,Loreena McKennit,"I never recieved one of the 3 CD's I ordered for a Christmas Gift. I have tried to get in touch with your shipper to no avail.Thank you,David Riccoboni"
5,"Lovely mix of Celtic, New Age and Classical","Loreena McKinnet is a wonderful artist. She writes much of her own material as well as adapting traditional songs. In additional to her lovely soprano voice, she accompanies herself on a variety of instruments including harp and keyboard. If you nave not fallen under her spell, I strongly recommend this CD as a great place to start. I especially loved her retelling of ""The Lady of Shalott"" with lyrics from the Alfred Lord Tennyson poem, as well as the Celtic power piece called ""The Old Ways."" Truly an outstanding addition to the CD collection of anyone looking for something intelligent, beautiful, and a bit out of the ordinary."
5,a unique blend of celtic-inspired sons inspired by irelands history. a rich and pleasurable listening experience!,"excellent mix of celticinspired songs, bringing a rich mix of history and legend to the lyrics. highly recommended."
5,Loreena's masterpiece,"Loreena's explorations of the world and its past continue with The Visit. As one who has every CD she has released from Elemental to Live in Paris and Toronto, I can say that this album is definitely her masterpiece, and that Ms. McKennitt has been the greatest musical inspiration to me, my dreams, my meditations, and my writing. From the beautifully image-filled ""All Souls' Night"" to the other-worldly ""The Old Ways"", which calls to me as if from home... ""The Lady of Shalott"", Tennyson's classic poem, is put to music, makes me wonder if she wasn't a Celtic bard in a past life. From beginning to end, listening to this CD is an inspiring, breathtaking experience."
5,Too good to deny,"My love of more traditional Celtic music made me leery of another modern interpreter that I feared would produce syrupy knock-offs.Well hat-in-hand I have to say I was wrong. Yeah some of the songs are a little syrupy, but she's so dang good you like it anyway. She has a wonderful yet textured voice, and an incredible ear for instrumentation.Simply put people like Enya and Clannad may have pioneered this genre, but Loreena McKennitt owns it."
4,Lorena McKennett: The Visit,"First, I was pleased with the speed of delivery and the price. Even though there was a slight flaw on the CD to cause it to skip once for a second, the entire content of the CD as a whole more than made up for it. I am pleased with my purchase."
4,Lady of Shallott is wonderful...,"Just the Lady of Shalot song is well worth the price of the cd, great cd."
4,The Visit by Loreena McKennitt,One of the very best. If you like that kind of music. But I think that most people do so:-))
3,She's done better,"I bought this CD due to the rave reviews I saw on Amazon. After listening to it, I must disagree with the other reviewers. I found ""Book of Secrets"" and ""Mask and Mirror"" to be far better both musically and lyrically. Also, the songs on this album don't flow from one to another as well as the other albums."
4,Very good,"This was the first Loreena CD I bought, having heard ""All Souls Night"" in any number of clubs and having immediately latched onto Tennyson's ""Lady of Shalott"" put to music. Musically strong and precise, this album doesn't show the same variation in style seen in her later albums. Still, very recommended."
5,The hands down best album ever!,"Loreena Mckinnet is the best singer the world has ever boasted. I'm not kidding. The Visit is my favourite of her albums too so that says quite alot. Even without the breathtaking mystical music her lyrics are beautiful enough to qualify as the best poetry I've ever read. The Old Ways is my favourite with its theme of a lost lover. None of these songs would escape my top 50 of all time except Greensleeves. All Souls Night, Lady of Shallot... You almost can't choose a favourite. My advice: Buy this if its the only CD you ever get. Music like this and a Greatest Hits album isn't possible. You'd miss too many."
5,Love this cd,"But then again, I love Loreena Mckennitt. Her celtic hauntingly beautiful voice brings a soothing quality to all her songs. Definitely not elevator music. Beyond beautiful."
5,Gorgeous collection,"I love every song on this CD. I believe ""The Visit"" and ""Book of Secrets"" are her best albums. I bought this album mostly because I love ""All Souls Night"" so much. Now, however, ""The Old Ways"" has moved to the top of my list of all time favorite songs. I'd never even heard it before, so it was a great surprise."
5,A masterpiece,"I was drawn to Loreena McKennit by someone else who liked Enya and recommended her to me. I was not disappointed. This was the CD she recommended and after listening to her others, she was right. This is her best! The only song on it that I'm not too fanatic about is Bonny Portmore which seems to go on forever, but this is more than offset by Courtyard Lullaby which has to be the prettiest song I have ever heard in my life. I can only describe it as haunting. The CD is worth it for that one song. All Soul's Night is another classic and turned out to be so popular, an upbeat version was made to play on for the radio stations. I liked the original much better. If you love Enya, you'll love McKennitt.As an aside, I have only given 9 other albums/CD's 5 stars to set them apart from all others. Click on my name to see the other 9. Maybe your musical taste is similar to mine and could find another CD you like."
5,My Favorite,"Everything Mckennitt does is beautiful, but I have a special fondness for this album. It starts out spectacularly with ""All Souls Night "", one of my two favorite songs on the album. My second pick is "" The Old Ways "" which I could see and feel as she was singing like no song I have heard before. It's short, but incredibly eerie and beautiful. All the others are wonderful as well. I did not take to ""Lady Shalott"" the way ninety percent of the reviewers here did. It's lovely, but the theme just didn't resonate with me. I usually prefer her original work anyhow. However, it still is not something I skip over. I listen to this album all the time and is definitely equal in skill and quality to her other top recordings."
5,PERFECTION!!!,"McKennitt has one of the most piercingly beautiful soprano voices ever. Combined with her Celtic roots, a good mix of World Music and incredible musical talent and creativity, her CDs are hard to beat in nearly all respects. These songs are so beautiful, lively, entertaining, haunting, adventuresome and downright magical, that I cannot imagine anyone who could find fault with them. All her CDs are worth endless listenings, upon all occasions. But I find ""The Visit"" particularly well-rounded and satisfying. I absolutely guarantee that unless you happen to hate Celtic/World Music and sopranos, you will find this CD to be one of your favorites."
4,Good album,"Overall, a good CD. I do think you have to be in the mood for Loreena McKennitt to really get the most out of the music."
5,A Visit to Revisit Again & Again,"LOREENA MCKENNITT is a multi-faceted musician and recording artist is a gifted writer and performer who focuses on neo-classical folk based on early or pre-Christian themes. Her hauntingly beautiful rendition of Alfred Lord Tennyson's ""The Lady of Shallot"" (1843) from THE VISIT brings to life the plight of a daemonic lady doomed by her love for the mortal Lancelot; the eternal longing of Psyche for her beloved Eros, and its promise so seldom fulfilled. As with many of McKennitt's works, The Lady of Shallot is woven with strains of ethereal sadness, a mystic musing that succeeds in both charming and ennobling the listener.The Book of SecretsParallel DreamsThe Mask and Mirror"
5,Peggy's preferences,"I ordered this album after checking it out from the library, so you know I thought it was good."
4,Im happy with this,"nice fights and well selected, bad sound and sometimes a bad image too but it shows what you want to see!"
3,Fantasia,The only problem is that the stories doesn't make sense and the controling was very bad I think that they should keep this in the drawing board.
1,Didn't work at ALL!!!,"This thing was a piece of junk. It didn't transfer the files after my having run it for almost 6hrs.! Don't waste your money. Get a portable storage device and Microsoft Office for Mac for your Word files. Pics are easy enoug, just transfer with the flash drive and select Open with.. on the Mac and select iPhoto. Your Mac will do the rest. I should have listened to the other reviews!"
1,Collection of old stuff,"The bottomline is DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. It's a waste of money. This DVD is just a collection of some old stuff from previous videos. Worst of all, they put together the worst (rather than the best segments) in this DVD. When I ordered this DVD, I thought I was going to see those beautiful and young college girls from the Newstand series. No, I was very wrong. I was cheated."
3,Not as bad as the previous review states,"Keeping in mind that this a compilation of previous junk already released on College girl videos you might see repeats if you've seen the other videos. I had never seen any of the College Girl videos. And with the exception of an absolutely stupid Carmen Electra (what a boring person) music video and a few lame sequences this video has several hot ones. I personally enjoyed the 50's diner, wash & dry, and girlfriends. These seemed the best out of the bunch featuring women that looked pretty darn good. The others while not scary looking or anything were just okay, which means you tend to forget about them because they look like every other model in the film.Depending on the price it might be a worthy addition to a collection but if its to high forget it."
2,Not a turn-on,"I am a huge fan of Playboy. I have had Playboy videos before, the material of some of which was included in this video. This is compilation. Frankly, it did not turn me on. I threw it away."
1,"So bad it's good, but gone back to bad again","I saw this movie with my wife at the Bagdad Theater in Portland, Oregon recently for their Super Trash film festival (if that gives you a hint as to the quality of this film). Not to let the cat out of the bag, but this is an Allen Smithee film, if that tells you anything. It's unintentionally funny in a few places, mainly because it's so ludicrous. Watch only if imbibing alcohol."
1,How is a movie this bad POSSIBLE?!?,"Okay, this is literally the worst movie I have EVER seen, and I include Plan 9 From Outer Space (which was funny, at least) in that statement. Trust me; you do not want to see it. You know how when a director's too embarrassed to be associated with his film he uses the pseudonym ""Alan Smithee""? Well, this is a Smithee production, and for extremely good reason. I recommend you see if your local video rental place has a copy, check it out, erase the tape, and return it. You'll be doing future renters a favour."
3,The first review,"I would say that this book was good in its own way. It was very informative and I would recommend it for a person who likes Mark Twain or is doing a report where you would like to have a lot of information. It isn't very exiting, but not many biographies are in my opinion. It is helpful for those who would like to know about the life of Mark Twain, but not exactly a book that will keep you too interested. It did tell the history of his childhood, but seemed to be short on that part. I guess it does do a good job to do a biography report because it is not too long overall, and does cover a lot of his life story. So, if you have to read a book for a biography genre, this would be a fairly good one."
1,Lasted Less Than a Month,"Because my six-year-old tends to drop his PS2 controllers on the tile floor, I was pretty excited to see this controller. I was thinking, ""Hey, a soft controller that might stand up better to this sort of abuse."" Right? Hah! Wrong. So very, very wrong.After less than a month, this controller simply stopped working. At first, I thought dead batteries were the culprit. But no dice. The batteries were alive. The controller, on the other hand, was as dead as a doornail. And because I'd bought this thing locally and hadn't saved my receipt, my thirty bucks were also goners.A major bummer."
1,Sucky,"This Controller is really bad. The minute I opened it up and started to play with it, it would press buttons automatically that I didn't even touch. It ""glitches"" so to speak. It is a waste of money. Don't buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Its goos til the batteries get old,"Ok this controller is a good idea exept for these problems:1. If the batteries get old thenm it justs stops period. I used one of those battery testers so I know how much juice it has left and it was practicly full. So I guess you have to change the batteries more often.2. Like Someone said before. It has no rumble. You know it dont vibrate. Which kinda sucks.3. If it gets wet it starts to smell funky. You know from sweat.4. My cat chewed part of it up since its so soft.5. It doesnt work for all games. A couple are: Crazy Taxi, and Demo Discs.Thats all the bad things I have to say about it. It is a preatty comfortable controller. And a good idea.Oh one more thing. On the box and in the instructions it says you can throw it. Dont. Never throw it. I had to buy a new one.okPeace Out"
4,Good game...but very unique.,"Home Alone is a fun,addictive type of game.The object is,you gotta keep ""the wet bandits"" from looting and flooding all the houses.There are five of them I believe.You can set traps in the houses.You can also piece together cool weapons against the wet bandits,by combinding different items that you find around on your sled and in the houses.If all the houses are looted...the game is over.Overall,Home Alone is pretty good.The graphics are excellent.The music is alright,although not really based off the film...but still good none the less.This game can be pretty challenging and hard at times.Especially if it's your first time playing,trying to figure it out...but it won't take you long to get used to it.I recommend Home Alone,if you're a fan of the film,or just like a good Genesis game."
4,A Good Read,"This book was a good read. The first book I read written from Judith Henry Wall was ""The Surrogate"" which I thought was top of the line. This book was entertaining but not as good as The Surrogate. I'm definitely looking forward to reading more of Judith Henry Wall books."
2,Absolutely Shallow and amateurish,Please do not waste your time reading this book. The story line and characters are cliched and very poorly developed. Not even good enough for casual reading.
4,Overwhelmed,"I saw this film in a theatrical release and have never forgotten its power. This film is a story within a story, showing the effects of jealousy and rage taken to extremes. Melina Mecuri is an actress preparing a production of Medea and is working with a former lover who rejected her for another woman. As research for her role, she goes to visit in prison a woman (played marvelously by Ellen Bursten) who has actually killed her children in a revengeful, jealous rage against her unfaithful Greek husband. Her ordinariness, complete absence of regret and the power of her rage are a facinating combination. Melina, along with ourselves, becomes a horrified witness (in flashbacks) to the children's murder. The emotions evolked were so powerful that I and my companions were literally stunned speechless by this film."
5,Greatest Scooter Ever,"This scooter is just great, I am 16, and I use it to travel to work, and friends houses. I love it, it's tough fast and can handle anything. I have taken it through mud and all off road areas, I live in a small rural area, and just love, it is a smart buy."
1,It's Impossible,I purchased two of these scooters for my boys and within a week of purchase my 14 year old son and his best friend were both in casts with fractured right arms requiring surgery. This scooter only has front brakes and both boys went over the handlebars after gently squeezing the brakes. One of the boys was going uphill and seated at the time.(He weighs about 130 lbs.) The company says that this is impossible. Two in one week. Doesn't sound coincidental to me. There were witnesses in both cases that confirmed the boys descriptions of the accidents. If you purchase one of these scooters anyway do not let anyone ride it without a properly fitting helmet. I can only imagine where we would be if it had been their heads and not their wrists. It is possible to be injured. Consider yourself warned and be careful.
1,stupid scooter,I got this scooter for my birthday and in one week it slowed down soooo much its not even funny. I liked it on the first day but thats it.This stupid scooter SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!
3,Just one side of the picture,"I picked up a copy of this book after spending the night with real poor people in our Inter Faith Housing Project so I don't really need to read this book, especially because it is so easy to criticize others and not offer workable solutions. When people bring up welfare in America, they usually mean poor people. However, the US taxpayer pays far more on corporate welfare, a topic vitally as important and never discussed in this volume.Right next to this volume in our library was a book entitled Walmart. Reading it will tell you a lot about how economics function in the real world."
5,"An immensely moving, informative, entertaining book","I really loved this book. Its a very quick read and its also extremely informative. You will learn so much about what its like to live in poverty in the US. It also details the history of welfare in America, how it was changed, and where it stands now. The book is no liberal propaganda either. The NY Times reporter who wrote the book comes to some very surprising, often conservative-leaning conclusions. You will be amazed at what he found and often moved to tears by the stories of the three women. An absolutely essential read."
3,What kind of a god would make this DVD so expensive?,"Mr. Show had it's moments. Blowing up the moon and the introducton of Mr. Wiggles(a monkey who will play ball) had me on the floor as did the guys protesting to get the girls to sleep with them(hehey, hoho, the girls we slept with have got to go!)Moments like these were not par for the course, though. For every one of these there's a sketch about animal love or a codependent landlord. It's worth it nonetheless for the stream of conciousness links between skits."
4,"Great if you're already a fan, but with problems....","If you're a fan of Mr. Show, then you know the skinny. Irreverent sketch comedy with a biting satirical edge. Python on steroids. You either love it or you hate it.That said, Season 3 is as good as the Season 1 & 2 box set. But the PICTURE QUALITY is unforgivable. Anyone who knows MPEG-2 compression will recognize that this was poorly encoded, with wavering quality. Most of the scenes look fine, but when it goes bad, it's really bad. It doesn't make the content any less enjoyable, but it's certainly frustrating to know they did a half-assed job."
4,"Save money, get the whole collection!","The humor is of course worthy of five stars, but if you buy one season at a time you will more than likely pay more than if you get the whole collection. If you watch one season, you'll want to watch another. So check the cost before you buy. Is season three the best? Maybe. It seems to be a matter of opinion, but every season has had absolutely hilarious moments. So I highly recommend getting the whole collection if you haven't already."
1,What am I supposed to do?,"It seems like some sort of Lemmings rip-off but I can't for the life of me figure out how to work this game. The instructions do not tell you what you're supposed to do or how to play the game. It just said, 'Krusty's house is filled with rats'.The gameplay itself is pretty bad. The Krusty character sprite is far too small and the level (the only one I can reach seeing as how I can't get past it) has bland graphics and sound.Honestly, save your dough for something else. Something that tells you how to play the game."
2,"Looks Good ""But Don't Be Fooled"".","I looked for a camera such as this one for quite a while, don't be fooled by the rating for your digital zoom, it pixles out so bad after just one or two times magification. If, I had known how bad it was I wouldn't have bought two of them. Only buy IP Cameras with Optical Zoom's.Learning was expensive......."
1,very disappointed,"I have read other books by Neil Anderson and been encouraged, so this isnt a critique of his theology or ministry - but - this book was for me a waste of time. Walking in Freedom is mainly just information, God is your Father, you are already free, God is holy - stuff like that, which is ""true"" - but generally useless for anyone dealing with real struggles. Yes, the Truth with set us free, but information does not. Walking in Freedom is has been little-to-no help for me."
1,Terrible!,"What a dumb, unfunny waste of paper. Apparently written by 12 year-olds on their first ever sleepover, stoked on candy and soda pop."
4,I laughed out loud,"If you like this type of humor, as I do, this book will crack you up. I read it in the book store and could not manage to stifle my laughter. However, I would not buy this book. It only takes a few minutes to read and this kind of stuff gets old very quickly."
2,A great Laugh.,"This book will make you laugh, though the cover is the best picture of the lot. It will not take a long time to read, and you will probably only do it once. Read it and give it as a gift. I would have given it 3 stars; but as I said it is a fast read, and the humor diminishes as you re-read it. Elected officials in funny/normal situations usually kept from the public."
2,Just plain yucko,"This is a collection of mostly full-page photographs, culled from the political world since Calvin Coolidge. While neither compelling nor comprehensive, it is marginally entertaining. The quality of the pictures is fine.You are likely to have seen many, if not all of the photographs someplace else. The single line captions below the pictures are silly and juvenile. This is not a format for the electronic age, and the ""feel"" of the book's construction is just plain cheap.Read it and weap. ...."
4,Fun,"First and foremost, I will warn you: Relatively few of the photos are funny in themselves (okay, that priceless shot of Hillary on the cover is an exception). The little captions underneath ARE pretty funny. We have Nixon wiping some lady's windshield, George Bush Sr. holding a hysterical baby, Bill Clinton and his bare-legged ""advisors,"" various pitfalls of Gerald Ford, Nixon and Elvis, Hillary, Powell, Buddy and Socks. (Yeah, the cat and the dog appear too)Democrats may initially not want to buy this book, given the priceless Hillary pic on the cover. But this pic is there because it's the best one in the book, not because it's Hillary. Both parties receive equal hilarity, based on their unflattering moments rather than their politics (there is one repeat offender who is a running joke). Add that Buell inserts his dry comments throughout the book (he doesn't think politicians should hold babies, or as he puts it, ""get into cute contests"") which makes this a funny short read."
2,Easily forgotten,"You'll think it's funny for the first 30 seconds you page through it, but then you'll get bored, set it aside, and never think of it again. Go to a bookstore (a brick building, not online) and page through the book for a couple laughs. Set it back on the shelf and walk away. It is not worth acquiring for your home collection."
4,No Match!,"I ordered the giraffe print 'bed in a bag' from Amazon and this valance came up as recommended. Believing it matched the bed set, I ordered it. WRONG! While the bed set and valance are giraffe prints, they are not the same and not part of a matching set. My own fault - I didn't dig too deeply into details. The valance looks fine on the window, and I may order a second one to bunch up the appearance a bit more. The lack of a perfect match really isn't bad - it all comes together in the room and looks fine."
2,Puritanical Garbage,"While ""Keeping Kids"" offers good advice to parents with out of control children, the statistics on various drugs are grossly falsified. Speaking as a research doctor with over thirty years experience in psychoactive drugs, I must caution potential readers of this book that the ""government studies"" referred to in the book are loaded in favor of the US policy on illicit drugs. The ""studies"" are often self fulfilling prophecies -- aka: propaganda.The ONLY accurate study is one done by an independent laboratory without an agenda. Beware: The US government can hire independent labs.Because was written for the purpose of education, it is a sin that children will be misinformed about drug use in the US."
5,I'm glad that my pastor recommended this book.,The DARE parents guide is really helping my family cope with a difficult situation with one of my children.
5,Pro Druggies Will Hate this Book,"It is important to note that those with a pro-drug legalization agenda have been ""bashing"" DARE for years. The criticism of this excellent guide is no exception.This is an excellent guide for parents who wish to keep their children drug-free."
2,I fear that parents will follow the advice in this book!,"After borrowing this book from a member of my church congregation, I read it in one evening. The advice offered in this book may have worked 20 years ago. However, the quickest way to lose credibility in the eyes of your child, is to apply the idealistic strategies suggested in this book. I cannot help but wonder when the last time this author actually taught children in the classroom, or spent time interacting with todays teens on an intellectually intimate level. interacted"
4,A good book to have.,"If you are a beginer or an experienced golfer, this is a good book to have. It has the right fundimentals to get on track with a good solid golf game. If you want to improve your game, or just beginning, I definetley recamend this book."
2,Some Good Information,"This book has some good illustrations and a lot of information about the golf swing. However, like almost all golf instruction books, it falls far short in teaching the correct way to control the swing, and how to work with the centrifugal force and momentum. For the correct instructions for the classic golf swing, I recommend ""The Golf Swing And Its Master Key Explained"" by Noel Thomas."
4,Keeps it Simple,"I played a round recently with a fellow who joined our group as a single. He was obviously a natural athlete, and later we found he played quarterback in the CFL. He hit the ball with authority, and a long way as well. He mentioned this book as being useful to him. Being always ready for a new approach to the game (I'm a 20 handicapper), I order this book from Amazon.Now I am recommending this book to beginners that I meet. I won't let my friends see it, because I don't want them getting any better. I have to pay them money after most rounds already.Jacobs keeps it simple, and it really makes sense. He doesn't contradict anything I've learned or read before.I've been waiting a long time to understand the swing well enough so I can put effort into playing and practicing, and feel like the effort is being applied in the right place.I'll make it simple, as well.Buy this book. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I'm not a good enough golfer to make that meaningful."
3,Its huge.,"The watch is pretty cool and its really different, but its just massive! Its like an inch thick and looks strange if you have a small wrist like I do. Also, its not really an infinite reflection, but like 5 reflections if you look hard."
3,Tea: A nice solid flavor,"Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's another book I've reread more then once.Though this is an old book, I thought the story was really good. I don't know how historically accurate it is, as far as the Druids, and the history of the area. I honestly didn't care, because I was caught up in the characters.Set in Celtic times, it follows a young girl, who becomes captured and turned into a slave...and escapes only to be confronted to the man who raped her. And while it may seem odd or hard to believe, she ends up falling in love with him. The story is about their struggle to survive, and keep their lives, land, and their culture against the invading Romans.Great characters, good action and intrigue, albeit probably flawed historically.A nice enjoyable read for a weekend get away or a daily life book retreat."
5,THe Silve Land is Gold!,"I thought that ""The Silver Land"" was highly entertaing and very enjoyable. The author makes the charaters believable and easy to relate to. There isn't a dull moment in this book and the action is never too far fetched. Historically the book seems correct and in any event, this book really takes you to a different world that is both entertaing and hard-to-put-down."
1,No Silver Lining,"This is a Celtic soap opera of questionable historical accuracy. The unending adventures of the heroine remind one of the Prince Valiant comic strip--i.e. there are too many adventures for one life, and the impression is, the author could have continued adding to them for 40 years."
3,Saved me money,"Good product, has handy ""recipes"" for bug sprays and whatnot. Beats paying for over-the-counter chemicals."
2,Lots of noise....,"I bought this cable a while back and was impressed by the quality of the materials. However, when I plugged it into my new mic the signal-to-noise ratio was so bad that I thought the mic was bad. I got a different cable and it sounded great! Maybe I was unlucky..."
2,Not so great at all!,"People, the cable merely worked. It is well made and it did transmit the sound signal but the input signal was very low using a Shure SM-58 with a MacBook Pro 17"" mid 2010. If you need to record with a microphone, you'll need an external audio interface with a good mic preamp in order to plug the microphone to it. The preamp will increase the mic signal, and you'll be able to get a good sound signal in your recording application."
1,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!,"When I took it out of the box, I was very disappointed to find that it is light, flimsy, and cheaply made. There's a cheap piece of plastic cap on top which is painted in silver and it was broke when I opened the box. I don't think the seller knew that so I wouldn't hold that against the seller."
3,Took a while...,"Product arrived wedged in a box that was too small for it, so some damage to the container. Took several days longer to get here than I expected."
4,A holiday treat,"If you are a tobyMac fan buy this holiday treat today! Wgile I would have preffered a full album, I recommend this 2-song single.The first song, the title track, is a spectacular song. Featuring the stunning vocals of Nirva (And toby!) and his young son, Truett, who is absolutly adorable, it's a great song! I like the bits of ""Joy To The World"" in it as well.The second song is good too, but nto as good. ""O come all ye faithful"" has a different flavour.If you are a tobyMac collector, add this to your collection today! But advice for Toby: How about a full length Christmas album next time?! ROCK ON!"
4,Awesome mix of Artists... but loses focus later on.,"There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the BEST compilations I have ever heard. Track #3 (Electrotheque's 'every 1's a winner') is probably one of the most amayzing synth / voice dance tracks I have ever heard. The only issue I have with this CD is that it starts to lose face later on. What starts as a high energy mix dives to a slower 110 beat and lower mixture.... not that the songs are bad - just not my style All in all, get this disc. You will NOT be disappointed."
3,solid mix,Good first release from a great radio dj. i'm going to see him at ultra 6 so hopefully that will make me appreciate him more. Maybe after that I'll pick up his next disc.
3,did i miss it?,"I must be behind the times, or simply not ready to have old school samples become neo-old school. I give respect to LT for the continuous bump, but it sounds like he was just playing with the knobs not really going for his. The album cover mentions breakbeats, if I heard one on this cd it would have knocked me down,I heard straight hip hop bump and experimental bass.If you want hip hop bump, this is your disc...but not for me."
1,not enough sound samples,"I would have bought the cd. But i need to hear the rest of the songs. If i don't, it's like buying eggs withought checking for cracks."
2,Screwdriver not drill,"This drill has an outstanding price but as far as doing serious work, you'd better move to the next model up. After using this drill, I thought it was just too weak. Mostly because it doesn't have the torque/speed switch like the 14.4 and 18Volt models. If you need a drill/driver for light duty this will serve your purpose."
1,Unable to handle heavy work,"This drill broke on me fairly easily. Upon taking it apart, I found that the gear teeth had broken. Probably best for light use projects."
3,"Good balance, Low power","I ordered this from the Net so I didn't get a chance to use it mano a mano. The first thing about the Firestorm is the ergonomics - excellent balance and handling. The downside is the power, or sheer lack of it. This is suitable for light home use and nothing more, and even so it lends itself mainly to masonry, wood and gypsum. Anyone requiring concrete and steel performance could do better with a 14V model or a corded. Price is comparable, although I yearn for the days when I still had my corded Hitachi before it was stolen."
4,Goes toe to toe with Dewalt.,"I Have this 12 Volt model and I use it for drywalling and installing Satellite Dishes, where I have to sink 3 inch lag screws. I also have a Dewalt 14.4 Volt which I also use as a standby in case I forget to charge the batteries on my B&D drill. I have found that the B&D can go toe to toe with my Dewalt 14.4 and alot of times lasts longer than the Dewalt for battery life. Plus the batteries don't cost an arm and a leg like they do for a Dewalt 14.4. And can be obtained at most any retailer. I have mostly B&D tools and use then extensively with outstanding results. I have an old B&D 3/8 inch electric drill with the steel housing that my grandfather owned, which I still use to this day. Some of you people that knock down B&D need to realize that sometimes you get faulty equipment, its that way with anything. That is why they have warranties on them. I just have to say, keep up the good work."
5,"Sharp Aquos LC46D92U 46"" LCD","Such a sweet lcd. Has awesome picture and I think the sound is really good. Some reviews said the sound was bad, but not my experience. If I need another big tv, I would definetaly get this one."
1,Do Not Buy This TV,I recently purchased a Sharp LC46D92U after reading the reviews. My set locks up on 61.1 (OTA) and I can't change channels or turn it off without unplugging it. Sharp has decided that it is a signal problem and will do nothing to correct the issue. How can an OTA signal completely take over my TV? I've talked to others in my neighborhood with other makes of flat panels and they have no problems. Sharp's customer service is the worst!
4,Sturdy enough but easily portable,"After playing bluegrass and folk on a dreadnought for 40+ years, I got an OM guitar. A musician friend advised me about holding it correctly - resting it counter-intuitively on my elevated left thigh rather than, as I was in the habit of doing, on my right. This requires some elevatuion of the left foot and leg. This inexpensive foot-rest did the job. It allows for positioning that creates the desired three-point guitar contact - with the left hand on the frets/neck, the waist on the left thigh and the top bout against one's heart'solar plexus. A lovely experience and a really easily mobile and sturdy piece of equipment."
5,Fantastic,"This CD shows the real talent of Pat. I bought the CD directly from him at a show in OKC. Popped it in the player and kept it there for days!! If you appreciated his songs with the New Grass Revival you'll love what's here. The CD features two which were penned during the NGR days ""Lila"" and ""In the Middle fo the Night"". Buy it and love it!!"
5,"1st book I tried, all I really needed!","Without reiterating what the other reviewers have said, this book was just so helpful to me in understanding my cybersex addition and finding comfort in the love of God to heal my wounds and bring me peace. My sister sent me the book right after I was fired for watching porn on the internet at work (worst day of my life). I have always considered myself a Christian, though was always at war with myself because of my ""secret"" side (and I'm no ""bible thumper""). Besides seeing God's work in my being fired, this book brought me so much freedom and joy through knowing that there was a way out and God had/would forgive me if I continued to repent for my past. I've ""fallen off the wagon"" several times in the past year, and I'm about to read this book again to get me back on the right track. If you're addicted, or think you might be, and want to find a Christ-centered way out, don't even hesitate - BUY THIS BOOK and READ IT."
5,A great book!,"The book was ordered for someone else. I was told it was an excellent book, got to the heart of the matter, and offered help/advice. They are very satisfied."
3,Disappointed,"I was somewhat familiar with asp and Access and I wanted a book that would teach me the nuts and bolts of VI. Instead I got more info on asp and databases (which was OK) but not enough about VI. Lots of good and useful info here, but not enough detail. VI has its own terminology: working copy, work space, project, etc. He never expains what these are or what is going on, but rather ""how to"" accomplish something. I want definitions; I want to go through all the menus and know what all the options are, etc. I learned a lot but I am still in the dark about some of the basics of VI."
2,For a begineers overview only. Otherwise borderline useless,"I was very excited to get this book after reading the amazon reviews. But was very disappointed. A very simplistic look at Interdev, spends more time on very basic ASP, and fills 25% of the book with SQL server verbage. I read the whole book in less than 3 hours. Perhaps it should be titled a brief summary of ASP and interdev. I would not recommend this to someone who wants to learn about Interdev, nor someone that wants to learn about ASP. I'll pass on the reviews next time and go to the book store and browse first."
3,Not for older kids,"Safe toy and great for preschoolers. However,we had a bunch of 7 and 8-year-olds play with them and the handles broke off within minutes."
4,As enjoyable and even more satisfying than the first,"""Miracle Workers"" was as enjoyable as ""Have Tech, Will Travel"". The conclusion to the Interphase story was worth the wait. The Cold Fusion story is set between DS9's Avatar and Abyss and filled in some plot points. Overall well worth reading."
5,Awesome CD,"A great group of people. This is 1 of my fav. cd's I encourge you to buy this, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Just one in the series, but good none the less.","Not as good as the prior ones in the series, but still worth the read. You really should read the whole series."
3,"good seller, good product, but a lil misleading","very happy with the seller and the product. my only concern was that I thought it would come in a box set type, instead all 3 books just came seperate. second, it's the newer books, not the older copies. other than that i a pleased. thank you"
1,Don't bother - Very dim bulb,"Don't bother. I wanted a battery powered mirror for travel. The mirror is on the small side, but I thought that would be good for packing in the suitcase. There is only one small, dim light bulb, so between the small size and the dim light, this mirror is too hard to see in - it defeats the purpose of having a lighted mirror if you can't see yourself in it. I just bought a Conair battery-powered mirror at WalMart for less money than this, and it's a bit larger and is much brighter. So this Rucci mirror goes in to the garage sale."
5,Go USA Navy!,"It is a mini US Navy magnet, identical to the ones you see on people's cars but smaller. Goes well on the fridge, but is a little small for a car unless you like the smaller size."
1,screwed by seller,Amazon ad indicated two each batteries came with the purchase. The charger was received but no batteries. Contacted the seller and was told the batteries were not included. I will never purchase any item through third-party sellers again.
1,Black & Decker VersaPak charger and batteries,I received the used battery charger and 2 batteries and the batteries were dead upon arrival. I charged them in the charger provided and they stayed dead! The charger is defective as the left hand charger keeps shutting down. Nothing works on anything I purchased from this personOverall a VERY POOR representation of a good used product. I want my money back!!!
4,Good price good product,I needed new batteries for my versa-pak. these are fine at a good price and are performing very well.
1,Do not buy!,"I have now had my second charger fail, which also ruined the two gold batteries that were in it at the time. It must have discharged them down below the point of no return. Black and Decker, when I emailed them, refused to take any blame or do anything to appease me. I would rather throw the whole system including the cordless 'Dremel' tool out then spend another $36 on my third charger. It just doesn't work! Cheaply made with an obvious design flaw since they have since introduced a replacement system that, of course, doesn't work with my existing tools.DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
3,?????,"I received this product and it appears to charge my batteries, however, one of the lights on the front of the charger does not work, which makes me question whether or not the product is charging. I contacted the manufacturer and I was told that just because the light wasn't on didn't mean it wasn't charging. I am keeping a check on my batteries, if they don't charge, I will contact the manufacturer again."
2,Batteries Just Die...,"I'd have to agree with other reviewers that these batteries HAVE MEMORY and last nowhere near as long as Black and Decker would like you to believe. I have probably 20 of these batteries and always charge them correctly, rotate them, keep them in matched sets, and they just die after a couple of years. In many cases, it's cheaper to buy VersaPak tools (with batteries) and throw away the tools. Luckily, the tools don't last either ;) You really have to view the VersaPak line as disposables."
2,they just don't last,"Batteries seem smart, but they don't last long when new (except in the flashlight) and they gradually just die off completely (and are not cheap to replace). Be forewarned."
1,Bad batteries,"I have the entire works of BD cordless power tools including the flashlight, scum buster, vacuum, cordless drill, recip saw etc., but no batteries. I had the ones that came with the tools plus some extras I purchased seperately. After a year of use, none will take a charge. What a waste, it is a great idea, but I guess the technology is not there year. ..."
1,bad batteries,"great idea - lots of different tools all use same rechargeable batteries. BUT these batteries die in <1 year. I have a whole set of tools that use these, but now my choice is: spend $60/yr on batteries, or get a new set of tools that will last longer! Pretty easy decision at this point... considering I already have a great Craftsman drill and there are other tools that use the same batteries.BE WARNED - if you buy these you will be buying them forever."
1,battery life,I have the silver batteries. They are for the scum buster and their battery operated blender. The products are very good but the the batteries dont workvery well. They give good service at first but after about 8 months or so they just die. I would not use Black and Decker until they change the batteries to something that will actually give 300 charges. These batteries are not cheap and you have no where else to go but from B&D. Maybe the new gold ones will work better. Forget the silver ones.
2,Same problems with batteries and charger,"B&D;'s claims for the batteries are just not true. I have had the same problems with very short battery life and intermittent charger described in other reviews. I have gone through several sets of gold batteries (don't even try the cheaper ones!).And now, to make matters worse, you can't buy replacements locally anymore (they have been replaced by other tools with different batteries) and have to scour the internet trying to keep my tools working.I will be replacing my tools very soon, I'm sure. The only reason I give 2 stars instead of one is that the tools do work pretty well when you can get a new battery in them."
1,Batteries die!,"I've got about 8 of these batteries that have had little use over the last few years, but are unable to be charged or hold a charge. They never met the 300 charges claim by b and d. I'l never buy another versapak tool. The batteries get really expensive when you have to replace them."
5,If only all 19 year olds were so intelligent...,"This book explores glaring issues that led up to and followed the Iraq war not fully examined by the mainstream media. Mr. Mauro illustrates how the elusive weapons of mass destruction were very possibly transported to Syria. The book also delves into the Russian and European fingerprints in Iraq weapons programs that was completely forgotten by media and the general public. Read this book and keep your eye out for Ryan Mauro, America's young rising star!"
4,XXX,"This is decent HC although the lyrics aren't so good, and one or two songs seem like filler. But this is a good album overall and certainly demonstrates the band's potential. The fact they now have two (or three?) new vocalists only adds to said potential and I'm sure their next album will be a crusher.p.s.- Any moron who would buy this CD because they like the face tattoos as seen in recent photos of this band will be heart-broken to learn that said tattooed band member does not perform on this album."
2,pretty bad,it's bad but not bad enough to get 1 star. i've played it a few times but it gets very boring. save afew bucks don;t buy it.
1,No good,"I bought a B&D codeless screw driver, Hedge clipper and dual battery charger. What a waste of money? These VP 100 charge do not last more then few minutes. You have to have the battery on charger all the time when not in use if not charge drains in few minute on idle. I was unable recharge these batteries more than 20 times. Waste of money."
1,"Right Idea, Wrong material to make it out of","As a machinist for 20 years and a tool nut I liked the Idea of the VersaPak tools. The light weight Drill was nice to use at first then it started eating batteries. Now the Drill is just collecting dust on the shelf and I have a drawer full of worthless batteries that wont take a charge. They worked OK for the first 3 or 4 times after that, nothing.When a pair of the batteries cost almost as much as the Drill did it's just not worth it. For the same price as the Black & Decker VersaPak Drill and extra batteries I got a 17 v. Drill from Cummins Tools that has kept a charge for almost a year with occasional use."
4,Get a charge out of these,I was really worried that I would not be able to find replacement batteries for my tools and was happy to find them on the web. They are just what I needed.
1,Worst batteries ever,"I was given a Versa Pack system for Christmas a few years ago, and these batteries are by far the worst rechargesble batteries manufactured by anyone EVER. I love the idea of the versatility of the Versa Pack tools, but these batteries render the the entire set virtually useless. The batteries don't keep a charge, and don't last for more than 5 minutes of use. Trying to use them for any sort of project is a complete waste of time. NiCad batteries are just awful."
5,Great battery at a good price.,The VP100 battery was shipped on time and works very well. This battery was a very good purchase for the price.
5,Exactly what I needed!,"I have had a hard time finding these. Amazon came though again. Exactly what I needed, fast and at a good price. Thanks Amazon!"
1,Buy Versapak GOLD instead.,"The silver version of these batteries just dont last. You will get 60% MORE life from the Gold batteries for a few dollars more. I have many B&D tools that run these batteries, including the ""Snake Light""...the Silver will go dead with one days use, as compared to the Gold, which will last up to 5 full days of use. You can get these for the same price at Lowes and Home Cheapo. You'll pay tax of course, but it evens out after subtracting the cost of (not) shipping."
2,Have Memory; Don't Last,"Unlike what B&D cliams, these batteries do have memory and don't last. Plan on replacing them about every 2 or 3 years (assuming you use and charge them to the letter). The standard battery chargers take 3 to 6 hours to charge these which is too long considering their typical life of only 5 or 10 minutes in use. On the good side, there is a lot of VersaPak stuff out there. The batteries are more suited to the flashlights than the power tools. The Gold versions work much better in the power tools."
5,Should Have Bought This Years Ago!,"I was still using the same battery pack that I bought over 5 years ago and finding it getting weaker and weaker over the past couple of years. Finally there was not enought juice to power my weed whacker and it occurred to me that maybe I should buy replacement batteries! The new ones work like a dream -- all the power that I remember from my original purchase. Now the week whacker works great, as well as my battery-powered saw and drill. Yeah!"
3,Not quite as good as the first,"Just as sequels are hard to do in movies, so are musical scores. Now the Batman theme is here, and Danny Elfman manages to update it for this movie, while it's not totally different from the first movie, it's been tweaked for the sound of Batman Returns. The catwoman, and Penguin themes are hard to listen to with all the high pitched strings that Elfman put into them. Danny decided to go very operatic for this movie, and it feels like it, almost to a point where Catwoman's score overshadows Batman's theme. No fault of Elfman's, the movie itself has A very dark and almost depressing feel to it, it's still an awsome movie though. But the score reflects that, usually the only parts of the score I can handle, are the opening credits score, Batman vs. The circus, Rise and Fall from grace. Again, I know what Elfman was doing, it's just a hard score to sit through."
5,Disturbing and Action Filled,The score for Batman Returns is a weird and intriguing piece. The Batman theme is slower and not heard as much. The Penguin's sinister yet childlike theme is playful and dark while Catwoman's is a disturbing piece with violins and drums. Highly recommended.
4,really captures the atmosphere of the film,"If you liked the glam gloom of Batman Returns, this album captures it perfectly. There are sweeping orchestral themes, flamboyant circus-style fight music, and the cooly sexy Batman/Catwoman love/hate song by Souxsie and the Banshees. This album makes great music for Halloween if you're not into the goofy Monster Mash variety of spooks. It's a little more ""classical"" than some Elfman music, with lots of lush minor scoring and pipe organ riffs."
4,Elfman's Best,"I'd say this is Elfman's best score. It's probably his darkest, containing a diverse array of themes. The best tracks are the opening titles, and the final conflict. It's fitting that Burton's best movie contains Elfman's best score. You're getting your money's worth with this."
4,Digital Cameria Tripod,"This was a first time order. The tripod came quickly, well protected and was new as advertised. The tripod was more than I expected for tasking pictures. I am a novice Digital Camera person that needs all the help I can get. The Tripod was easy to operate, the camera was compatable with the two shoes that came with it."
1,Poor design!,I ordered this tripod only to have it arrive with two of the lower leg struts (plastic) broken so the legs couldn't be braced correctly. Sent it back and got a replacement - it also arrived with one broken strut. The plastic must be very weak so beware. Wouldn't recommend this for anyone backpacking etc.
3,Seems some whot promising,After just owning the QSX Pro 8500 i had to take it back within 3 weeks as the head broke. Made with diecast metel so when tightend the metel contracts. As as most know diecast metel does not do well under presure.Hopfuly thith one will last longer or not?. If it going break hope it does it within a month so i can get a refund as i am no longer going play this game were companys put your $300+ $550 + $250 in my case at risk.3 stars to it could be better and the only thing wrong with the other was that they used diecast metel. No alloy key screw fittings or a like so can easy be solved by your self.
2,Wrong Item Shipped... Be Aware,"I ordered the Sunpak 9001UT, but received a Quantaray (by Sunpak) QSX-9001. It does NOT come with the free second quick-release plate as the description claims. Ritz Camera's invoice for the 9001UT has an item number that matches the QSX-9001. This leads me to think the QSX-9001 is a replacement model for the 9001UT. IF so, Ritz needs to update their catalog and descriptions.I returned the tripod to Ritz online, and went to the local store. They did not have the 9001UT either. The closest model I could find with the free second release plate is the Quantaray QSX 7001 DX."
4,Tripod,"This item fit the description and was exactly what I wanted. I ended up finding a wonderful tripod from a friend that was unused and could not pass up a free tripod. If that had not come along, the tripod would have been perfect."
5,Perfect fit,"Perfect fit, great material. I love these pants they are by far one of my favorites. If they made these in different colors I'd certainly buy them"
1,Worthless,I ordered the black BDU pants and they faded after the second wash!! Not worth the money. I've had better quality pants for $15 online before. Never again!
3,ADHESIVE BACKED SANDING SHEETS,THE ADHESIVE DOES NOT STAND UP TO THE ENVIROMENT. I CARRY THEM IN A TOOLBOX ON MY TRUCK AND AFTER A SHORT TIME THE ADHESIVE FAILS. THIS ALSO MAKES IT USELESS BECAUSE THE SHEETS ARE TO SHORT TO USE THE HOLDING CLIPS THAT HOLD NONE ADHESIVE PADS.
3,works BUT,This generator works like it's advertised to.. BUT you must follow the directions and run it once a week because it does not charge the starter battery off the house power ...it only charges while the generator is running.......so if you leave it for too long ...no battery equals no back up protection. I'm going to rig up a trickle charger (it should come with one)6 months later... I have rigged a $30 battery charger/maintainer up and everthing is fine.. This is what the unit needs from the factory(Amazon $29.04 Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Slow Charge Battery Companion)
1,Corinthian Leather?,"Chrysler made up the term ""Corinthian Leather"" in the '70's. There's really no such thing. I heard it was actually all made in New Jersey."
3,BEST!,"I love this cover it is the best I got one for my brother, sister, mom, dad and grandparents they loved it they all said they where going to get some for all their friends if they could get some because these things sell out quickly"
3,This smells like the 80s,"I ordered this fragance without actually knowing how it smelled. Well... turns out that I knew the fragance, back when I was a child in the 80s. For me it meant that I smell like an old guy, but it seems that some people like that.The Frangance has been described by my family members as: baby powder, soap, after shower. Personally I think is not exactly that, it smells ""manly"" but there's certain motel soap hint in the blend. If you like that, if you like remebering the late 70's and early 80s, and you are over 30 years, probably you would like it, personally I quite didn't. But is not bad, it's just not my type; bought it thinking it would smell like (because a site said so) Joop NightFlight or La Perla Touch, but it's VERY far from that."
4,Different from the cologne,I love all the Tabac products. The EDT spray is a much more long lasting scent than the cologne and slightly different smelling. I actually prefer the cologne smell but it doesn't last very long.
3,had to use walkthrough,"I'm sure it must be a fun game for those deep thinkers, but I was looking for something a little more laid back. My brain gets enough of a workout at work, want to give it a rest during down time."
1,Laptop Users Don't Bother,"I got this game a bit ago hoping to play it on my shiny new laptop. Unfortunately it says...in incredibly TINY print that I could not read that it does not support my graphics card. I went online and, no help what-so-ever and 'don't bother they won't have any patches for laptops'. So, I wasted my money and can't take the game back...when are laptop users EVER going to be able to play any games?If I ever can play this game, I will rate it again..otherwise don't bother getting it. This Sucks."
1,One of the most god awful games ever,"I don't remember many of my Genesis games from way back, but this one sticks in my mind for being the worst of the bunch. It was so horrendous... The controls were so awful you wanted to stomp on your controller and throw it out the window. Animations and sound effects were as bad. The devs tried to make characters and enemies that were too large for the system to handle. Very poor game."
5,Great way to show your pride!,"I considered several options for displaying my son's TaeKwonDo belts and bought this one because of the little trophy guy and place for a photo. My son loves it and I am able to nicey and neatly display my pride in his accomplishments. the belt holders are a little difficult to assemble, but on e together hold very well."
4,Good book,Read this book after coming out a bad relationship. I wanted to see if it had any good advice and if I'd make the right choice to break up with my boyfriend. It's got some good tips and things to help you consider all aspects of your relationship.
4,Why Not,"I think this is worth a read. Much like it's counterpart He's Just Not That Into You this contains some common-sense advice but, it's advice that's probably worth reading since you're looking for books on this topic. I actually liked this one better than He's Not That Into You, and I attribute some of the things in this book to helping me go on to meet my husband after I read it."
4,Good.,"It's good, gives insight and stuff... it may not completely apply to you but it lets you know you are not alone."
5,"OMG, best break up book ever!","After a particularly hard break up, a friend let me borrow this book. I am currently reading through it again, that's how much I love it. It is so helpful and also friggin' hilarious! There are stories in there from real people who totally made me feel like I was sane. LOL! It offers real world advice and also lets you know that you are not alone and you will make it through stronger, better and happier. When I'm feeling down about my breakup, I just read a little of this book and I feel better. Did I mention it's funny?? :)"
5,Why didn't I find this book a year ago???,"I'm sure there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said, but thank GOD for this book!!! I feel like the book was written for me. Seriously, had I had it a year ago, I would have saved a lot of time and pain. But, since I didn't, its REALLY helping me now. I'm way ahead of the curve because of this book.I like their style of writing; it keeps your attention and they're very entertaining.While everything in the book could be considered ""common sense"", I know that I definitely lacked common sense in my relationship and the breakup. It was the kick in the pants that I needed at a really yucky time."
5,It's Called breakup Because It's Broken,"This book is hilarious, which helps distract your from what you are feeling. At the same time, the advice given in it gives you great ideas and hope. Both Greg and Amiira give straight forward answers to the questions people who have broken up have that they might be too afraid to verbalize. I highly suggest this book to both men and women who have recently gone through a break up."
4,Sooooooo true!,It helped me and I know it can help any woman. I have many friends that dont speak english and thanks to this book i am now the best helper/adviser they have for they breakups. I LOVED IT!! God bless the Begrebdt family.
5,"It works, perhaps too well","Listening to this audiobook will definitely help you snap out of your depression and will make you see the relationship you just left for all its flaws.Whenever I felt sad or nostalgic I listed to 15 mins or so and I could usually snap out of it. I feel strong and I do not look back.But I regret that I have lost all sweet feelings for any good memory I might of had of that guy, I see the whole relationship as a fraud and flawed and I do not feel good about that. Like Barbara sang, 'Memories, light the corners of my mind, misty water colored memories, of the way we were...' I'd rather say I was in love with a great guy but it didn't work out and I had my heart broken than I was a fool and I went out with an idiot and it was terrible the whole time, and the only time it wasn't terrible I was kidding myself.I listened to half the audiobook maybe a quarter would have been enough."
4,"Funny but not as good as ""he's just not that into you""","I thought this book was helpful but I still question how a guy can really give advice on this topic. It seems like you would be better equipped to advise someone if you went through it yourself. But that's just my opinion. I would recommend buying this book along with a bunch of others and read them all. Some are good for humor, others for real advice, etc."
4,Its great!,This is a great book that states the obvious to those of us who overlook it. Yea break ups hurt but we need to remember that there was something wrong anyway and that they is something better for us out there!
5,A lifesaver,"I'm not even through reading this book and it's already helped me immensely. It answers all of the questions going through my head and I feel better after reading just a few pages. Even if you are the one doing the breaking up, it's not easy to get through it and this book helps tremendously."
5,Tough Love,"Funny, witty and full of tough love. Their advice got me though a pretty tough break up and they tell you stuff you NEED to hear, not what you want to hear."
3,Powerful,It's a powerful book that made me overcome my recent break up in few pages although I didn't think I could.
2,Don't read if not going through breakup...,"I read this book for the first 200 pages then I literally threw the book against the wall. This book is so boring, repetitive, and completely depressing. Maybe this book is helpful for someone going through a break up, but seriously if your not in any real pain from a recent break up then skip this book (or you will be in serious pain from reading it)."
1,SuperFox = Stupid Book,"Did this guy see too many starsky and hutch reruns? or did he just watch the movie too many times. I felt stupid reading this book, it's not what i needed to help me thru a breakup, it made me think about how my boyfriend always talked down to me like i was stupid. I gave it to a friend of mine who downloaded an eBook called the break up workbook from the broken hearted girl website, she said it was very similar but written from a young girl's view like me."
1,Nothing special,I really didn't get much out of this book and I found it to be poorly written. Oh well.
1,Not for me!,I bought this for my girlfriend and she didn't like it. She said it didn't apply to her. That's the only reason I'm giving it one star.
5,A must-read for those who are undergoing a break-up!,"I've lent this book to more than five friends already--it's THAT good. Sure, it has the same nuggets of advice you get from any other break-up book (be careful of rebounding, break-up sex is never good, don't call or see him/her, it's normal to feel unloved, etc)...but it's presented in a witty, funny, and non-preachy way that actually helps you see the break-up in a whole new light. That said, I wasn't embarrassed to pass it on to friends who needed a post-break up pick-up (""No, it's not a self-help book. Just. Read. It."")It even has a section in the back for guys. Oh, did I mentioned I lent it to my OLDER brother, as well?"
3,Cute!,"If you have just broken up with someone, this is a good book to help boost you back in the right direction. Sometimes, we all need a little wake up call!"
4,So helpful!,"This book has been a real sanity saver! I have the book and the audiobook and I've spent a lot of time with both. Yes, the advice is common sense, but when you're in the midst of a breakup, it helps to have validation of what you're feeling."
4,"Start here, but move on","This book was an enormous help during those early dark days when I alternated between being sure he'd want me back and thinking I was the biggest loser in the world. Its gentle humor had me laughing even at very difficult truths (like if he's not calling, he doesn't want to talk to you), and I think the advice to wait 60 days is exactly right.Eventually, though, I think it's important to move past the ""I'm perfect, he's the loser"" salve and take stock. Sometimes two great people just don't make a great couple, but sometimes we doom ourselves to repeat history if we don't face our own failings."
4,Helped Me Out,"After breaking up with my boyfriend of 5 years, my friend recommended that I read this book. The book was good, however it was mainly aimed toward women who have been dumped by a*!hole boyfriends who cheated on them, didn't love them, treated them bad, ETC. My case was a little different as I was the dumper and our breakup was based on the fact that I was ready for marriage and he wasn't, so a lot of the content in this book didn't really apply to me. However, it was comforting to read the advice about picking yourself back up and moving on with life and also there are plenty of crazy breakup stories that made me feel relieved that I wasn't experiencing. I would recommend anyone going through a breakup to read this. The tone of the book is kind of comical and it will cheer you up to know that others have gone through the exact same thing you are experiencing and survived!"
4,"Helpful, very","Humor, during a break up, is a most welcome friend. This book did a great job at providing great advice while making me smile and laugh. The tips were sensible and practical, and the writing style light and funny! Great companion for anyone who is suffering from s post break up."
5,Healing For a Broken Heart,Get the blunt advice your friends would give you at the end of a relationship. You'll find healing in these pages.
4,"Not Helpful for the Dumper, but helpful for Dumpee.","It's very much focused on the girl who was dumped, so the book barely touches on the girl who had to make the difficult decision to be the one to break things off. I wish it would've touched base on this process a bit more as it would have been extremely helpful to read about, because it can be just as painful. It gets a bit reptitive at times, and sometimes all I want to do is just yell, ""but it's NOT just about being with the wrong person, he was just a plain jerk!!!!"" (I hope someone out there reading this understands what I mean). Overall, a good buy, no doubt. A super easy-read and a few giggles here and there. But if you're going for something a bit more touchy, detailed and just overall rounded a.k.a. pertaining to both the dumper and dumpee, look elsewhere."
2,"Still simplistic, but some good advice.","I read this when I thought I might be going through a break-up, and I ended up returning it in part because 95% of it is common sense and highly simplistic, but then the break-up didn't really happen. Some of the advice is awesome--don't call, 60 days without contact, look good all the time--but a lot of it is so obnoxious and sarcastic that I can't get behind it.For the money that you spent on it, take a good friend out for dinner who can tell you THE EXACT SAME THING."
1,A mean book...,I thought this book was mean and harsh... If you just got your heart REALLY BROKEN don't get it. You don't need to be depressed more than you already are. It was written by a happy couple. Who wants breakup advise from a happy couple?
5,Mandatory reading,"OH MAH GAWD. Laugh out loud funny, compassionate while simultaneously cruel, this book should be mandatory reading for all girls.Kudos to Team Behrendt!"
4,Brokenhearted,I bought this book because my best friend recommended it. She had gone through her own break up and now it was my turn. It was a great way to help me realize so many things about my lost relationship. It wasnt a bad breakup but it did leave me with a hole in my heart and many questions left unanswered. This book tells you how to not do those things that you oh so want to do like calling your ex just because you miss his voice or stalking him. My breakup isnt your typical breakup because I see my ex everyday and thats what hurts the most. I know it wasnt my fault and this book helped to realize so many things but at the same time I couldnt help but wonder why. It helped but at the same it hurt to hear the truth. Another thing that I liked about this book was that it included the male perspective of a break up. You hear what he is going through although it may not necessarily be the same it does help.
5,Common Sense Girls,"This is a great breakup book from funny guy Behrendt...I found it suprisingly open, honest, and helpful, also Gregg isn't afraid to shy away from the (sometimes ugly) breakup truth. Hope there are some additional books forthcoming."
4,some good advice,"It's Called A Breakup Because It's Broken is quite beneficial to those who are/have been recovering from being dumped. Very funny with practical tips on how to take back your life. I personally don't feel that everything applies to everyone (i.e. I didn't gorge myself with food or partake in risky behavior). It's nice to see stories similar to your own. When reading them you think ""Well, that's ridiculous..."" and then it hits you, ""Oh wait, I did that!""It takes repeated exposure to practical advice before it finally sinks in to stop torturing yourself.Anywho, definitely worth reading, even if only for a good laugh."
3,The Gospel According to Luke,I have used it for a small Bible Study group.The reflections have been good. Haven't usedthe questions as much. Maybe could be a littlesimpler. Nice and small.
3,"Great Points, Mediocre Writing",There is no doubt that the guy knows what he is talking about. I think it brings to light why Christians in particular have reason to care for the environment. The book often becomes pretty dull but it's still worth the read for certain.
5,A great camp story!,It was a very good book. I liked the part when Molly and her friend fournd the bank and played their sneaky trick. This is one of the best American Girl books
2,Review,"This is the first of Kathy Reichs books i have read (actually I never made it through the whole book). I will more than likely not read any more of her novels, too slow."
2,Not Her Best,"I am a Kathy Reichs fan but was very disappointed in Break No Bones. The story was improbable on many levels (frolicking with Ryan while Pete lies in the hospital, etc). The characters were flat, there was little tension in the story line, and the ending felt like the author was rushing to meet an editor's deadline. If you really need your Reichs fix, wait for the paperback or go to the library--not worth the money for the hardcover."
2,Tedious,"I realize this isn't a popular opinion...but I will never read another Kathy Reichs book because of this one. Temperance Brennan is an extremely self-centered and humorless heroine. I could'nt figure out how this women had any friends. Plus her working with the olice like she does is unreasonable. No way would she get to do the things she did. I know, I know...its fiction...but I really want the plot to make sense. Sorry fans!"
4,Kept me reading,"The only complaint I have is the main character always seems in pain! It is tiring! And confusing, the reader is to be drawn by her strength but she is always in a constant romantic quandry and nursing wounds. Otherwise the storyline was strong and interesting. Authors description of Charleston was vivid and I loved it."
4,Much Better Than Cross Bones,"Temperance Brennan, forensic anthropologist, is in South Carolina at a Native American burial ground when a skeleton, buried in the more recent past, is uncovered. This proves to be just the tip of the ice burg. In this, the ninth book in the Tempe Brennan series, Reichs leads the reader on a merry chase. This plot isn't original, but Reichs takes a fresh approach and the characters she develops keep it interesting. This was a fast and entertaining read...much better than her previous novel, Cross Bones."
4,Break No Bones Audio,"I have read or listened to all of the Temperance Brennan novels and I love them! I enjoyed the story in Break No Bones, but I didn't like the narrator. Dorothee Berryman's voice is not suited for Temperance Brennan. I felt it was too syrupy sweet and was distracting to the story. Katherine Borowitz or Michele Pawk who have narrated other Temperance novels are much better suited to the character of Tempe."
3,"""coroner procedural""","Kathy Reich's books fall into the ""coroner procedural"" genre pioneered, perhaps, by Patricia Cornwall. ""Police procedurals"" usually involved a hard-bitten, tough cop who doggedly continues through a series of setbacks, and succeeds in nabbing the perp.In the Reich/Cornwall genre, a formidable woman (with a hidden soft center) doggedly continues through....you get the picture. The ""value added"" ingredient: Lessons in anatomy and physiology, for those interested.Reich's tone is knowingly arch, with many references to pop culture and current ""news"" stories----like the ""runaway bride."" Her books have been the source of a popular Fox tv series.Here's my disclaimer/confession: I ""doggedly continued"" to try to finish the book, but I soon put it down to...yes, clean out closets(!). The style, story, and setting wasn't for me, but in all fairness, many readers will find ""Break No Bones"" fascinating."
2,Audio book review,"I did not make it past the first CD so I am not sure how the entire book is. I listen to books on CD constantly as I have a lengthy commute to work each day. I have never watched the TV show Bones so have no clue about that. All I know is that whoever reads this book is monotonous. Maybe it is the story itself. I will always give a book a chance by listening to the entire first CD, which is what I did with this. I am used to much better reading from the likes of Joe Mantegna (James Patterson novel reader)and Lorelei King (Janet Evanovich novel reader). I can't have a book putting me to sleep. Sorry"
5,Tempe Is Better Than Kay!,"I had just finished slogging through the last 4 Cornwell books and had decided that I was through with Kay Scarpetta unless there is some drastic change in Cornwell's writing when I read a review in which someone suggested Kathy Reichs' work as a better alternative. A big THANKS to that reviewer. He was right. This is the first Tempe book I have read, but I will go back and read the earlier ones now. I really enjoyed this one. The book was well written, had some pace, only bogged down a little in the middle,and got the story told with a minimum of fuss. I liked the characters and thought the sparring between the husband and boyfriend was a hoot. At this point in their respective chronologies, Tempe is definitely better than Kay!Renee S. NY.C."
3,Break No Bones: a Brittle Read,"In Break No Bones, Kathy Reichs removes her heroine Temperance Brennan from the familiar surroundings of Montreal to her childhood stomping grounds of South Carolina. Amidst the unexpected plethora of bodies and turmoil comes the unresolved turmoil of Tempe's own reactions to the men in her life. Given the lush and humid setting, however, Reichs fails to deliver the Temperance Brennan readers have come to expect. This Tempe hedges her bets:she has far more mixed feelings concerning her former husband Pete than the Tempe readers have come to know. As a plot device it just doesn't deliver.The reader does get the feeling this book would do well as a screen play. With one eye to a different medium, Reichs may have written a different characterization than the one she intended. Loyal readers and fans of the novelized Tempe Brennan may be disappointed. New fans of the character, brought to the story by the televised series may just be confused."
1,I didn't bother to finish this one!,"Humor is not Kathy Reichs's strong point. Try as hard as she might (and she REALLY tried!), Sue Grafton or Janet Evanovich, she is not. The sarcastic sniping she sprinkled into ""Break No Bones""--especially between Ryan and the snarky, incredibly un-likeable Pete--was just plain forced. If anything, Tempe's intense seriousness was what made her fun to read. I disliked the tone of this book so much, I didn't finish it. Who did it? I didn't really care."
3,Break no bones: the 9th Temperance Brennan novel,"This novel held my attention from beginning to end. I liked the character of Dr Brennan as depicted in the earlier books and don't much care for the frenetic overlay of all the personal relationship angst. I know that some readers will enjoy this, and those readers will probably accord the novel a higher rating.Still, the story had me interested from the beginning, and trying to work out who the links between the bodies and who the villain really was from the likely possibilities was absorbing. The story moves quickly, and the forensic detail is well presented. Kathy Reichs brings an eye for detail to her characterizations as well as to her science and there is plenty here to keep a reader interested.Recommended for mystery fans with an interest in forensic medicine.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
3,"Better than ""Cross Bones,"" but....","After the literary disaster that was ""Cross Bones"" I was very leery of picking up ""Break No Bones."" I was pleasantly surprised in that parts of the mystery were intriguing yet saw the motive for the murders from a mile away, as will almost anyone who has read much in the last ten years.Also, I was disappointed to see that Reichs relies extensively on one- to four-word sentences. C'mon, Dr. Reichs, we're grown up and can read -- and even understand! -- longer sentences!! The constant, staccato delivery of such fragments is really distracting and ""dumbs down"" the narrative.I had been under the wrong assumption that Tempe was divorced, yet was reminded in BNB that she and her husband Pete are merely estranged. This makes the whoopee with Ryan while Pete is also sharing the same house seem rather, um, odd. Anyway, if Reichs could just return to the mature writing style of her debut, ""Deja Dead,"" I'll be a fan again."
5,hooked on bones,I really am enjoying this book series. Kathy's research is so indepth. She makes me think while spinning a great story.
4,Another great book,"Yet another great book by Kathy Reichs! Each one of her books is better than the last, just can't put them down!"
4,Break no bones Temperance Brennan 09,"From the first book in the Temperance Brennan series I was hooked I like that they are different from the TV series but I do wish the book Temperance had a little more back bone, having said that I am about to start book 11 and will stick with it till I have read them all. Each has its own appeal and I love the running tension with Ryan ( the cop)"
3,Gives a good insite into forensics,"For someone who likes CSI & NCIS, I found it to be entertaining and informative. I did like it."
4,Another Temperance Book,The book is okay--nothing special but a good way to pass a few hours with nothing else to do.
3,"great story, cd has annoying delivery","as usual this is a great story, Kathy Reichs and Temperance Brennan do not disappoint. unfortunately the audio cd reader has a ""breathless"" delivery that is extremely annoying. buy the book an enjoy the mystery without the irritating voice."
3,Good but flawed.,"This entry in the Brennan series is much better than the disasterous Cross Bones. The plot is good and kept me guessing. BUT... as Kirkman correctly pointed out in a previous review coroners do not do autopsies. This isn't a trivial error. Also, one of the bodies in the book has been hung. But the head has falled off. OK - the human head isn't attached to the rest of the body by bone, but only by muscles and ligaments. But the rest of the body is still hanging from the noose. What's keeping it there??? In reality the rest of the body would have fallen when the head fell off. This is a stupid error for Reichs to make."
1,Don't know why I tried.,A Kathy Reichs novel.Will there be lots of one sentence paragraphs?Yes.Many of the same questions asked over and over by the narrator to herself?Yes.Will there be lots of one sentence paragraphs?Yes.
3,First and last Tempe,"This is my first Kathy Reichs novel. I have a problem with 1st person narratives. One has to love the narrator to put up with her for hundreds of pages. Tempe is fine but not for hundreds of pages, getting into all the petty details that drive me up a wall when reading a mystery. With 3rd person we can get a break from the internalizations! We can put the narrator on hold and enjoy the story. (I have the same problem with the ABC mystery writer, too.) In both cases, Reichs and ABC writer, the narrator is in my space, too much, her face right in front of me, nagging! I find myself skipping pages not related to the mystery, that just drag me along. Oh, well. Give me a good old fashioned 3rd person point-of-view where I can get some relief from the ego-maniacal narrator: ""I..."", ""I..."", ""I..."", IIIIIIII!"
2,decent story... terrible audiobook reader,"I listen to a lot of audio books in my daily commute, and as far as the story goes, this one is not bad. I enjoyed it, but I wasn't exactly captivated by it. But the reader of the book... yikes! She is really terrible. She mumbles at times, and just doesn't seem to put much into it. No question, this one is the worst read audiobook production I have listened to."
4,Break No Bones,"The story takes place when Tempe on the beach of North Carolina, so nice setting of sun and sand. Begins with the discovery of a skeletan in the sand by a class she is teaching. The story continues to how Tempe and estranged hubby, Pete, overlap in the investigation of who is the skeletan? One unsolved death leads into another and Tempe gets into the middle of it all when the hunk, Ryan appears on the scene a bit unannounced. Friction and rivalry takes place between the two men, trying to woo Tempe's affection. The plot thickens to a point where Tempe's and Pete's lives are placed in danger, One easy and suspenseful read, blended with a bit of romance."
1,Yuck,"This is a review of the audio book...I couldn't get past CD 2. The protagonist/narrator is so impressed with herself, her intellect, and her physical appearance I couldn't stand it. The book seems written for the most indiscriminate and easily impressed of readers. When Temperance (or somebody else) quoted Jerry McGuire ""show me the money"", (gee, that's original) I was through. The rambling plot is very typical of the genre and the characters with whom we should sympathize are obnoxious. The TV character is much more interesting...the brilliant Temperance on television is often socially inappropriate, which makes her interesting and kind of endearing, the Temperance in this book is just kind of snarky and self-satisfied."
2,Tedious,"My first Kathy Reichs. I'm disappointed. The plot is ok, but you have to have an intimate knowledge of anatomy as well as a detailed map of Charleston and environs to appreciate the progress of the plot. I have neither.I'm Danish and live in Denmark, but it's not that I'm unfamiliar with the English Language. I actually prefer English Language books, since many titles are badly translated, if at all."
1,Rambling and boring,"My lastest audio book in the car was Break No Bones by Kathy Reichs. The main character was the inspiration for the Fox tv show Bones. I love the show, so I was prepared to love the books.I hate the book. The only thing it has in common with the show is the character name and field of occupation.The book has a lot of extraneous, rambling information that contributes nothing to the story. It starts out very slow, and doesn't get into the story very quickly. I listened to several chapters while trying to decide if I was going to bother listening to the rest.I did listen to the whole story. It did have a bit of a twist at the end, but most of it was predictable and boring. It could have been cut in half, and the story would probably have improved.If you are a fan of the show, I would suggest you avoid the books completely. They are very disappointing and have nothing in common with the show."
4,Break No Bones,"Excellent in the vain of all Kathy Reichs books, not quite as good as ""Cross Bones"", but all together excellent. The reader was hard to get into, for me the reader on the Audio Books, is very important and this one was not as good as the person who has read all her other books."
1,REOs aren't a bargain,"Its the same ole same ole... besides, you find better deals working with a REALTOR(R) looking for motivated sellers in the MLS. First, when a notice of default is published every real estate agent and their brother in the area is hounding the owner to list and sell before foreclosure and REO (so many do), and second, if it does go REO, there are so many bottom feeding sharks looking for a ""good deal"" in an REO, it gets bid up and often goes over market in a feeding frenzy..."
3,Good Read if REO is your niche.,It has a great Buy Low and Sell Model and Buy and Rent Smart Model. It repeatedly states that you must buy low buy low buy low. But where are the REO agents that are willing to talk to you and sell you REO homes...because they're not returning MY phone calls!!??? Maybe that's in another book. There is however a great cover letter to use along with your offer. This just might be the edge you need to land your purchase.
1,"Buy Low, Rent Smart, Sell High","This product promises more than it delivers, like their book, the claims make big promises, but there are lots of disclaimers, and no real meat, just ideas which are supposed to be real good, but who knows. It seems to be another link towards buying more of their stuff."
4,overall pretty darn good,"Book was very simple to read, finished it in 2 days, probably could of done it in one except for a big accounting test got in the way. The book gives you another strategy on real estate, and it is very inspiring to get you off your butt and go do it."
4,Exceelent book on Sylvia's most interesting period,"This book concentrates on Sylvia Pankhurst most radical period, when she was involved in the anti war movement, international communism and the ultraleft. Good information on the London radical scene and the communist left. Draws out intersting contributions that Sylvia made, such as the Social Soviets, and also makes links to other radicals such as Amadeo Bordiga."
1,Zipper broke in the middle of an international flight,"Bought this product for an international move in which our cat was to travel in the airplane cabin with us. Unfortunately, the zipper of the top hatch broke durin the flight, so Roger had to be manually restrained throughout the flight and on the tarmac, where he could have run off. We had used the product twice before for quick vet visits, so the zipper failed after only a few uses. My overall impression is that the Sherpa product I purchased was made with poor-quality materials, and I would recommend a different brand, particularly if you don't desire the product to fail at a critical moment."
4,Yay Sherpa Bag!,"I have a chipoo (chihuahua/miniature poodle mix). I thought she would fit in an airplane approved carrier easily- I was wrong. Her legs are pretty long, as well as her body. I was trying to find a pet carrier for United, but she couldn't fit in any of the regulated carriers, so I went out on a limb and bought this carrier. She fit in it well and after reading another review about someone using this carrier and folding it down, I hoped I could do the same and it worked! The last flight I was on was an EMB 120 Brasilia turboprop (30 seater) and there was no way my dog was going to fit under the seat, but they didn't say anything and thankfully the plane wasn't full so she sat next to me. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it is bigger than airline approved and it was much more difficult to fold down than I had hoped. Great bag, I might use it again to travel with my big cat!"
1,Dog chewed through it!,I think this could be a great bag if you are not traveling far or have a very relaxed pet. Our 11 pound dog managed to chew threw the mesh siding about 20 minutes into our 5 hour flight. I think if the mesh was more durable it would be a great bag. I just feel I cannot give it better then a 1 star rating because we paid alot of money for this carrier to last 20 minutes. We had to purchase a different carrier to fly home with.
2,"Where is the 20"" length?","After researching this bag and many others for frequent airline flights with my 16# Sheba, I drove 4 hours to find one in stock. The store manager and I could only measure 18.5 inches in length, including the extrusion of the end handle. I seriously doubt I will be allowed to take my dog on the plane with me in this bag, and flying into cold weather - well below zero, I am worried about her safety under the plane.I am VERY disappointed with the advertising, AKC recommendation, and the ability to find a carrier for my pet. I cannot imagine a 20# dog fitting in this carrier."
5,Perfect for my 20lb dog,I was so worried that this carrier would be too small for my 20lb beagle/pug mix but it was PERFECT! I saw a lot of bags at Pet Smart that said they would only hold up to 18lb and looked a little small but this worked out great. It fit under the seat of my South West flight with a little manuvering. I have since used it thrice.
4,Cheap alternative,"Probably not as good as some of the other ones out there, (Under Armor, Nike) but they get the job done. Padding is comprised of an extra layer of fabric, and really doesn't offer much ""slide protection"". I use them in an adult mens baseball league, so they are good for me, but maybe not the more serious player."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"I bought this CD thinkin' for some awesome Solid State hardcore/metal. Yuck. When reality Sinks in sounds like their just screamin' the noah's ark story, although the beginning of that song is rad."
2,"Not completely faithful to the original LP, 35% of album was re-scored","Growing up with this music as a child, I've grown to know it word for word, along with the musical style that it was originally written in.That said, nine out of the 26 tracks on the CD/MP3 download have been re-scored (and have different instruments/vocals than the LP):1) Come Along With Me to Jesus3) Come, Lord Jesus11) Peace Is Flowing Like a River14) Sing a Simple Song15) Our God Is a God of Love - Not only re-scored, but also words have been replaced to make it more ""politically correct""16) Come and Go With Me18) This My Commandment22) New Hope24) God Is Building a HouseSo, if you're are thinking about purchasing this because it's what you listened to as a child, and you want the original recording, you are better off buying the LP and digitizing it into MP3 format yourself.I've met Carey Landry, and he's a great guy, but I do not agree with what he did with this CD/MP3 release by modifying the original recording."
4,A lot of fun!,"A game for the whole family! With a large selection of cards to choose from, this game is a lot of fun and educational as well. Although, if you play it a lot, you start running out of cards. But there is now an expansion pack you can buy."
3,It's Outburst with pants,"Game is very similar to outburst, except a little more subdued. It was fun, but as a family with grown children we've played better games. The best part was the smarty pants so you could do the smarty pants dance!"
2,Ink doesn't show up very well,I was disappointed in these pens. The ink didn't show up well so I had to buy others at the school supplies store.
3,A Collection of Vintage Newsreels and Documentaries,"This documentary was a little dull, but it wasstill interesting to watch. Features a lot ofnewsreel and archival footage about the US Navy.My grandpa loved the footage, he actually servedon the one of the aircraft carriers featured inthe video."
1,bad quality,Very disappointed of buying this DVD. The video contains very old film and quality was bad. Feel very unconformable watching it.
4,A good gift,Great fun for my grandchildren...and me! My grandson was thrilled with the game and it was great fun watching him play it
5,Sonic 3 Part 2,"If you liked Sonic 3, you're in luck. Sonic and Knuckles has about 65% of Sonic elements (-25% levels, -4% Tails, -6% Save Files)What's even better is that the cartridge contains lock-on technology!What is it exactly? You plop Sonic 2 on top to play as Knuckles in Sonic 2! Plop Sonic 3 on to combine the two games together! Sonic 1 on top unlocks Blue Sphere, a game made out of Sonic 3 Special Stages.So yeah. Sonic and Knuckles is the second part of Sonic 3, and it is just as good."
4,"Blue and Red, once political adversaries now are a team!","I wondered if there ever was a hidden reference to the American political system with these two (sonic being Blue, knuckles being Red) I also bet I am reading way into this lol.Anyways onto this review, this is one of the best Sonic games ever made, right up there with the legendary sequel to the first game and also the mind blowing Sonic 3-D blast! The worlds are very detailed and the music in some of the levels are really good like Lava Reef and Death Egg Zone to name 2 of my favorites. The game is designed very similar to Sonic 3 with a sub-boss in the middle followed by the mustache maniac Robotnick. The fact that you can lock it onto sonic 3 makes it that much more enjoyable and makes sonic 3 that much longer. You lock it onto Sonic 2 and now you can enjoy all those classic zones as Knuckles and discover new secrets about the game.One of the best in the Sonic Series, and highly recommended to anybody who likes adventure games."
1,Game Doesn't Work!,"Tried everything imaginable, Game does not work and will not work! All other games I bought of Sonic from others worked, This 1 did not!"
3,"nice throw, bad picture","The colors are off, and not warm like the picture. The weaving creates a blurry picture, and it's hard to tell what it is. The back is a mess of random colors. This is not a two-sided throw."
3,"63 ""accessories"" a misnomer","The Wizard rotary tool works fine, but as with many ""toys"", it doesn't live up to its hype as far as the 63 accessories is concerned! Each copy of sandpaper wheels, etc is counted as an accessory. Also, the power pack is awkward and not the best design for quick recharging."
3,Kind of wimpy,"I received this for Christmas last year. Although it's suitable for most of what I use it for, it doesn't have a lot of power, and I certainly haven't been able to do all the things they show it doing in the commercial. Even if I did, it would take forever, because the charge on the VersaPak doesn't last very long."
3,Portable but Whimpy,"This is a handy tool because you can grab it and go anywhere with it to use on weird/odd projects of very small scale. If you try to use it on anything more substantial, you'll find it is very underpowered and you'll go through a lot of batteries. A rotary tool is supposed to be a high-speed device. This VersaPak unit turns very slowly and bogs down easily. This causes you to use more force than you would use normally which drammatically shortens the bit life, especially the cut-off wheels. On one small project, I gave up and borrowed a friend's powered Dremel drill. Wow! What a difference. I now have two rotary tools: powered and this VersaPak."
5,"A beautiful, original doll","My daughter and I have a My Scene collection, and this one is my favorite. She has beautiful coffee skin and gorgeus wavy hair. Her face and makeup are so pretty. I really like this line because of the great hair and the modern stylish clothes that are a much higher quality than the usual Barbie fare. I especially like the shoes (and boots), which are much larger and stay on. I have all the extra outfits; since the dolls come with stands they can display their cool outfits when we're done playing. There is nothing I don't like about these dolls. I really tried not to like them when they first came out, but once I checked them out I was hooked."
1,are these dolls original???,I would like to point out how much my scene dolls trends resemble the bratz. They dont look alike but when bratz came out with winter wonderland two months later my scene did. These has happned before with other bratz and my scene dolls. I personally would rather buy the more original doll- Bratz
1,How ugly,this doll is sooo ugly. I like bratz better. barbie tried 2 copy Bratz and they didn't do a good job! all my friend agree Bratz are better than babish barbies.want my advice? Get a bratz!
3,Entertaining but Unfilling,"This book is a highly entertaining collection of brief, oversimplified and amusing (sometimes incorrect) facts about alcohol. A bathroom reader if I ever saw one. If that's what you're looking for then by all means buy this.But do take his advice seriously, drink while you read it so that you won't notice the typos (e.g. ""There are a number of theories explaining why we clink glasses with our companions before taking the first sip but there are a number of theories."" pg 11). Also, if you are looking for something that will actually inform you about the history of alcohol then look elsewhere. This book got a few facts wrong in the very first pages and continued to do so throughout. Finally, the ink was printed very thin on several pages making it difficult to read at times.In short: a fun, light book. Buy it on sale."
5,A must-read!,"Lendler has crafted a simple yet engaging book on the history and peculiarities of just about every alcohol type we know -- he peppers his succinct and interesting descriptions of the beverages' histories with a rapier wit in a conversation-like tone (e.g. he writes out the word ""Natch"" in place of ""Naturally""). It is a fun book to read.This is a must-read for anyone with a passing interest in any particular genre of alcohol, or for anyone who just enjoys good reading."
5,Good to the last drop,"Alright, sorry for the bad pun, but this is a very funny book. The bartender at my local pub was reading this and I joined it. I didn't know half this stuff. I especially loved the part about the brewery in england in the 1800's that built the biggest beer vat ever seen. Too bad it burst and sent a wall of beer down the street wiping out buildings and people too!i totally recomend this."
5,A Must Have For Any Drink Aficionado's Library,"This was a fun book to read and reread from cover to cover. Each chapter was entertaining and informative with interesting tid-bits, historical caveats, and famous quotes. If you want to impress (or bore) your friends with seldom-known facts or off-the-wall stories about their favorite drink, then buy this book. This book is the best accompiament to a good dram of single malt scotch.Cheers!"
5,Fun book about alcohol and consumption,"As one in the wine and spirits field, I found this book very fun.When I received it I read the first page, and then finished the entire book. The book is filled with tons of unimportant information that is fun and interesting.Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointing,"This book predominantly covers American stereotyped super hero comics. Although graphic novels, the best types, can be painted novels, or use mixed media or digital compositions, manga to realistic style - these aren't really covered in this book. The title is very misleading. The picture selection is extremely sparse and poor quality. The case study is silly. Overall ... uninspiring and dry."
2,Author doesn't seem qualified,"This had the usual ""chock fulla"" feel in the store but a closer reading indicates the author thinks too highly of his qualifications. The kind of people who latch onto this idea, then that, achieving nothing substantial, are the kind who like to tell others what to do and meddle in debates. I'd like to rate this book higher, but in the end it doesn't even reach the low level of the genre."
4,What I was looking for,After 20 years being out of touch with comics and now wanting to get back into it this book provided all I need to get started.
2,"Great at first, but finish didn't last",Has this for less than a year and all the silver finish came off... now it's just a black piece of plastic. Will have to get a nicer one next time.
3,Birthday gift for Boyfriend,"I think the package got hot on shipment because the sticky tape on the back of emblem stuck to the paper packaging, instead of the emblem. ended up having to go to AutoZone to get more sticky tape, and now it looks great.Purchasing was fine, shipping was on time, boyfriend is happy with gift."
1,good company bad product,"I dont know what metal they used on these, but these pliers started rusting within 2 weeks. I am a klein man; from lineman's to screwdriver's I swear by the company. Something tells me these were counterfeit."
5,Made in USA. Of course its a 5,Klien is the best in tools you can get. check any pro's bag at you will see a Klein. Best money you will ever spend. product is superior to all.
4,A Crisp and Clean Biography of Colour,"Oftentimes, biographers try to surmount an Everest of information by immersing their subjects in a garden of superfluous prose and praise; Montfiore does the opposite rather successfully however, by painting a truly colourful man, regardless of his supposed faults and triumphs, in the most prosaic way possible.As such, he wonderfully weaves a smooth story about two of Russia's grand despots for the reader to grasp and subsequently fathom."
4,Haven't received this yet,"Although I haven't received this yet, it should be very good as it is an update on the older book which I swear by."
5,Wow!,"I never knew how many over the counter medicines could be replaced by safer, herbal alternatives. This book is easy to read and has a great index where you can look up various ailments. The index takes you right to the page where it lists the herbs that can help you. The book also provides many different herbs that can be used for one ailment so you can have more options available to you. It also says how the herb is used and prepared. Excellent book for someone that wants to have well-rounded health-care. I can attest to some of those remedies in the book, they do work!"
4,Well-balanced and comprehensive,"This is one of the better books on natural medicine that I have come across. Too many of these types of book are page after page of overblown and unsubstantiated claims mixed in with dubious and eclectic philosophy. Dr Duke, however, backs up claims wherever he can, frequently with reference to proper research, and in many cases he will come out and say that he he is doubtful about certain claims made for this or that herb. His writing style is also quite enjoyable and occasionally funny (although I could do without some of the cutesy names he gives some of his own concoctions). A very good purchase all in all."
5,wonderful book!!!,"This book is a wealth of information on an extensive list of ailments. I would highly recomend this book to anyone who wants to supliment or replace ""western"" remedies. I have personally used this book to cure yes cure my families ailments for years now. I have most recently cured my sons hacking cough he would keep us all up with every night. For $3.50 I bought marchmallow and star anise and made a tea for him. after three doses he hasn't coughed since. that was 2 mo. ago. I Love This Book!!!"
1,This book is lame....................,"I bought this book based on other people's recommendation of this book. I was disappointed and the lesson I have learned was not to buy a book other the internet without having a chance to flip through it. The print is large so there isn't much ailments covered. If you want an herbal pharmacy guide, I would go with something else. This is basically an ""herbs for dummies"" book, not a book with real solutions. DON'T BUY. I want my money back.."
5,Cuts to the chase!,"If you're looking specifically for the medicinal and healing properties of herbs in detail, minus the maze of scientific verbage, this book is it. Provides the interactions, sensible dosages and precautions one needs to immediately begin using nature's pharmacy with confidence and peace of mind."
5,great book,"This book is full of both great information and Dr. Duke's personal stories. He hasn't just studied these things, he's also experienced the healing power of plants. I had checked this book out from the library and liked it so much that I decided it needed to be part of my home reference library. Getting a used copy was a good way to have such a helpful book without having to spend a lot of money."
5,James Duke Rocks!,I really enjoy this author and his no nonsense approach to herbalism.He is very real and thorough in his writings. He shares stories and things to help set the image in your mind on what helps or does not help certain situations.Excellent Information
4,Informative and appears knowledgeable,James Duke seems to know what he is talking about. Written in simple layman's language - no fancy medical terminology. Anecdotes are interesting. Worth buying if you are looking for a book that tells you about alternative herbal medicine.
2,WAY TO ROCKY!!!!!!,Since this had a 5 star rating I thought that I would buy it and that they would be wonderful CD's to add to my collection. Boy was I ever wrong. Out of a total of about 30 songs I only liked about three. If you don't like the EXTREME rock/rap beat then I would NOT recommend buying these CD's. Some of the songs were so loud with the beat you couldn't understand the words and sometimes you couldn't even hear the words. I don't believe that this is what God called music or praise.
5,value & quality,"no matter what i need, i ALWAYS look at amazon 1st. i couldn't find it cheaper. christian stores are a rip off!!"
5,Excellent,Watching the Winners....Learning Their Style is an excellent resource for anyone preparing to enter the pageant industry or someone wanting to improve their skills. Shana has wonderful tips and encouraging comments to guide you from A to Z. Highly recommended for any pageant contestant....from babies to adults.
2,Big but Bloated,"Let me put it this way - I don't like Shipman's tastes. He knocks just about every great film from the 60s and 70s in a way that definitely sounds like a generational difference in tastes. He knocks Hal Ashby, he knocks Godard, he knocks Truffaut, he knocks Coppola, he knocks Altman. Basically, he attacks any who differed from the traditions in classical studio cinema up till that time.Okay, it's subjective you say. It's opinion. Yes. But his reasons for dismissing these filmmakers feels like rationalization, not sound reasoning. Shipman comes off as someone resistant to change, to evolution, and it makes his book a somewhat annoying endeavor.That said, any book this big on cinema is not bad to have around the house, if only to flip through for fun now and then."
5,Fun twisty-turny ride!,"This is a great popcorn eating fun scary movie! 'Nightmare Man' is another classic horror-comedy from Dir. Rolfe Kanefsky starring scream queen Tiffany Shepis. This is essence of Kanefsky horror- great comic lines that come just before the gross kill, the tough sexy Shepis toting guns and crossbows and an awesome traumaqueen performance from the gorgeous Blythe Metz who was pretty darn believable. True to form Kanfesky takes us on a thrilling ride full of twists and turns. It made me jump in my seat and laugh out loud! If you want high art, go to the opera, if you want a fun night with friends eating popcorn in your living room, get Nightmare Man. If you haven't checked out Kanefsky's other movies- try 'The Hazing' and 'There's Nothing Out There', you won't regret it!"
3,I couldn't stop laughing!!,"I love B or even C horror movies, and I've enjoyed most of the after dark films I've see. I will actuaally buy this when it gets under 1.00 on amazon market place. The filming wasn't great, the actors were attractive but only the girl playing Mia did what I would call acting. The setting of the house in the woods is a fave of mine, but the chases through the woods were terrible. I think it had to do with the budget, maybe it would have turned out better if he stalked, not ran throught the trees. I would only reccommend this to people who like B or below horror, and have enjoyed most of the other films to die 4. Otherwise, I can tell you right know that'll you'll hate this!"
1,HORRIBLE,"I wasted my time watching this piece of crap on instant stream because it had 4 stars. Only realized later it was from 1 ridiculous review. Do not waste your time. Movie is BORING!!! No plot, no character development, no story, obvious bad guy. Cheesy but not even in a good B movie way. Just sucked. I'm only glad it was free."
1,Badly shot,"This looked like a student film shot on digital video and then edited with a blender. It's not so bad that the story is all over the place but it just looks AWFUL. I'm not one to usually get stuck on points like cinematography and stuff but it was so distracting. At one point I think they actually reversed the coloring in the background to look like a negative! And then to have Richard Moll (Bull, from Night Court) show up out of nowhere as a lawman was just so weird. I don't think I'll be watching this one again and I bought all 8 of the 2007 horrorfest titles. Of the 5 I've watched so far, this is the worst."
3,I wish I'd have bought something else . . .,"This was my first electric sander, so I can't compare performance, but I agree with the other reviewers who point out that it doesn't collect dust the way it's supposed to. Despite others' enthusiasm for the hook and loop feature, it didn't turn out to be all it was cracked up to be. If you're doing a bigger project (I was sanding down the wood trim on a window I had stripped) the paper wears out pretty quickly, and they're not exactly cheap. It's better than sanding by hand, but I wish I'd [pulled] it up and spent a little more to get a Bosch or something like that."
5,the best sander on the market,"I purchased the sandstorm for my husband, he was thrilled when I showed it to him. Since then he has used it several times and says that it is the nicest sander he has ever owned. The hoop and loop feature is great, it makes changing paper fast and easy. Also, it has very little vibration which makes it more comfortable to use. No more dips in the wood. And now the wood is left much more even. I would highly recommend to any wife buy this one for the husband they will be thrilled."
1,Pay a little more and spend less time.,"I bought this sander trying to save a little money. It started out working pretty well, but got to the point where it would take a long time to sand and the finish boot broke in half. Black and Decker did replace it, but by that time I was fed up with this sander and had bought another type. It never picked up any dust and performed poorly in a short while. My advise is that if you are doing any type of half-way serious woodworking, then spend a little extra money. You'll be glad you did (and it will cost less) in the long run."
4,One of the most versatile sanders out there,"This model combines the effectiveness of a random orbit sander with the detailing of sheet and detail sanders at a pretty good price. I found it easy to attach the orbit and detailing pads, and the velcro does a good job at keeping the sanding pads in place.The only negatives are the sound (it's noisy), the fine detail pad lost its effectiveness quickly due to wear (thankfully, B&D includes several extra detail pads), and most of the dust ends up all over the place instead of in the collection bag. I still recommend keeping some old-fashioned sandpaper or a sanding stick handy for detail areas and hard-to-reach places.For standard household work, this sander worked well for my most recent sanding project (sanding a window moulding). As I said before, the 3-in-1 features make this a good buy."
2,Fell apart within 18 months,"Mine fell apart within a yaar and a half, and I haven't bothered to try to get it fixed. Most of the time, it sanded pretty well, and I love the hook and loop. But, this isn't the model to get.Spend a little more and get a high quality tool. The dust was never collected at all, so it was worthless without a shop vacattached.I am finished with Black and Decker tools, I have never had one last more than a couple of years. Spend the money for the better tool, it will make for a better result, and there is nothing more aggravating than having the pad fall off in the middle of your project.If you are buying a gift for an aspiring woodworker that you love, get a Porter Cable, Makita or DeWalt. Mine was a gift that I was too sappy to return... Now, I am asking for a new Sander for Xmas, think it will be a Porter Cable."
1,Worked three hours,"I used this sander three times. About an hour each time. I tried to use it tonight and the switch would not turn it on. I shook it and tried again. It started smoking below the swith inside the housing. I'll take it apart tonight and see why it started smoking, but there is no way it should have a problem like this with so little use. I think I will go back to Dewalt or Makita. The Dewalts are under powered, in my opinion, so I may check out Makita first. I hope this helped. I have never had a sander quit after 3 hours of use before and thought folks should know the issue I had. The smoking wires inside are a safety issue as well."
2,Basic first time sander,"I bought this a number of years ago as my first ro sander. It was okay but I agree with reviewers on a number of points, ie, paper is a little expensive, dust collection is useless, fine sanding point wears out quickly, noisy, underpowered.I quickly moved on to better sander from Porter Cable and then on to a Festool. It would have saved time and money to have bought the Festool in the first place rather than have the BD languish in the bottom of my tool chest."
5,A Fun Platform/Action Game,"I was surprised by this game. I found the game to be fun and addicting. If you like Donkey Kong and Shinobi, it is like a mixture of both, you will like Pirates of Dark Water. What's great about this game is that a friend can jump in and help you out in co-op. An overall great game."
4,"Thank you, Marianne!","In these tapes, made during lectures, Marianne Williamson inspires us with words of comfort, peace, and wisdom. Many of us feel in need of guidance in our ""dot-com"" world, facing pressures from many external forces that tell us what we should be, feel, look like, how we should act, etc. Ms. Williamson helps us focus on what's important and helps us approach ourselves and each other with the love and respect that we all deserve. Her approach is wonderfully practical - thought provoking, but not requiring mind-numbing thought. After listening, I can put her approach into action. Each time I listen, I hear something new. Her words make for a better world. The response of the audience affirms this, too. All in all, these are wonderful additions to my library."
3,Good product but where will you get a replacement light bulb,"The flashlight itself has worked without fail for two years, except the lightbulb burned out recently. Good luck finding a new lightbulb! You can bet the store you bought the flashlight from does not carry the xenon bulb. Also, Black and Decker service centers are few and far between. Although their web site gave me a distant service center location it provided no way for me to order the part on line. Let the buyer beware..."
4,a great dependable product,"I've had 2 storm lights for about 3 years now, in this area, brown outs are common in the summertime, so my storm lights are depended on. A few reviewers mentioned having trouble finding the replacement bulbs..all I had to do was call a service store, order them and they came in under a week. I wouldn't trade my storm lights for any other product. As a flash light they are great, adjustable beam and the rubber on the handle prevents slippage. When I get a power failure my storm light in the hall turns on and we can find our way downstairs without a problem. I'd reccomend this product to anyone."
5,There when you need it,"Ever try finding a flashlight when the power goes out? You won't have that problem with this light. When in its mounting/charging bracket, it comes on automatically when the power fails. (I keep mine at the top of the basement stairs, and it gives enough light to make it out of the cellar during a storm.)You can pick up a spare battery at most home centers, so you'll have emergency lighting to last for several hours. Not like it will illuminate a whole room, but for whatever you'd do with a big flashlight.The only thing that I found a little odd is that when the battery is fully charged and the light is left in the bracket, the bulb glows faintly all the time. Consider it a bonus night light.I now have several VersaPak tools, and really appreciate the quick charge time and fast battery replacement."
3,Great Light unless you burn out a bulb,I had this for about 1 year when the bulb burnt out. I have been unable to find a replacement since. I went to the closest Black and Decker service center and they did not have one. I could order one and wait and come back. The hours of the store are only M-F 9-5 so stopping by after work is out of the question.
4,Can't Find a Bulb-Light worked good for 2 years,"Nice light, but I cannot find a replacement light bulb for this product.Worked good until the bulb blew out.Good luck, mine is still in the dark as I cannot find a bulb."
2,Darn Handy but Made-to-Break,"My Workmate ""was"" the handiest thing around. It folds flat, is quite stable, and is nicely adjustable. The problem is that the worm screw parts and table mounting brackets are made of cheap PLASTIC. It didn't take long, but one by one, they've all cracked and broken. The particle board surface also chips and splinters with use. I think B&D designed this product to die after a year or two. I would give it 5 stars if all the critical mounting parts were made out of metal. B&D needs to at least sell replacement parts which I haven't been able to find anywhere."
3,They don't make 'em like they used to....,"Don't get me wrong - the Workmate is a very useful ""tool"" to have around - it's just that I have the ""misfortune"" of perspective: I also have an older version of the workmate (actually the model 200) to compare to. The ""new"" version uses metal that's *half* the thickness of the old Workmate, and the jaws are made from 5/8"" bamboo vs. 7/8"" laminated industrial board. The new version does allow for more adjustment in the jaws, but the mechanism for this makes the jaws feel flimsy. Like I said, the Workmates are nice to have around and pretty much worth the money - but it's just sad to see that time and technology have produced a less robust product. I guess that's just one more sign of the times...."
4,Great bench for the price,"This is a great bench at its price. If you're looking for extremely high quality you're kidding yourself though - the plastic clamp pieces feel like they may break easily but the wood boards are much more sturdy than you'd expect. The other thing is, what other items are out there that can fold up and be put away in such a small space.I'm using this as a workspace in a small apartment with limited storage space so saving space is important. I've only used this a few times but it's been extremely useful and sturdy and I'm excited for its future uses."
3,Workmate WM225,"The workmate is OK but not great. This is our third workmate beginning with the first one purchased in the 1970s. Not unsurprisingly the workmates get lighter and flimsier as time goes along. The wooden jaws are very thin one the new one, there is no tool tray, and sure enough the plastic leg compoents (the ones that break in a few months) are still there. We got this to load on the truck and take to work sites, it will do the job, but I expect it will only last a few months."
3,Black & Decker Workmate 225,I was disappointed with the light weight construction of this product. I had owned one several years ago and it twice the quality of this one. This one will probably serve the purpose for light duty home projects but would not want to use it on a daily basis.
1,"Great Idea, Terrible Construction","I received this as a gift from work and was very much hoping that it would be useful for various jobs around the house. Putting it together wasn't too bad, a little bit of a struggle. Used it for a month, then threw it out. My opinion is that it is a very poorly made, dangerous piece of garbage. We considered giving it away rather than throwing it out, but we didn't want to be responsible for someone possibly hurting themselves while trying to use it."
1,PICTURE ONE ITEM AND SEND THEM ANOTHER,"Just got off the phone with Black and Decker. I'll make this short. The picture on the Amazon.com product page for the Black & Decker WM 225 Workmate is not of the product that Amazon is selling. The first picture is of the Workmate with a black tool pouch accessory that is attached to the bottom. Well, the one I received did not contain that item. B&D; has informed me that the first picture displayed on Amazon site is indeed that of a model #WM 225 TP (tool pouch). This product was last available in 2005.A supervisor said that Amazon has been informed previously of this error and that B&D; continues to receive calls such as mine. So! wanted you all to be aware that WHAT YOU AND I SEE IS NOT GOING TO BE WHAT WE GET."
2,Workmate Black & Decker,"Rating was because the top parts that clamp the piece in it. Does't work that good. To use it you have to move that moveable top, has three position to clamp different parts and if you want to move the Workmate using the removable top piece board it comes out the holder. If I would of known that I would never of purchase the product.Don't like it a allWould not refer the product to anyone.."
2,not quite sturdy,this bench is not as sturdy as I had hoped it would be plus the cranks are a little tricky.
2,"Handy, but poorly made.","Despite the fact that the locks on three of the ""swing out and lock"" legs are broken, I still manage to use the bench frequently. Now, I'm looking for a similar product that's made a little better."
4,Husband Likes,We got this for my husband for Christmas. He has set it up and really seem to like it. I hope that he will get plenty of use out of it.
3,badly packaged,"This is a gift and the box arrived with a gash on top and it had obviously been opened and taped up with one single piece of tape. I won't unpackage it until I give it to my husband as a gift, but I will be amazed if all the pieces are included and there is no damage. Disappointing."
5,bench,My husband and I have used this item many times it is sturdy and made our work much easier.Amazon got it to us in great time and I would order from Amazon in the future
2,Assembly was a joke,"Honestly this was the worst product I've bought here on Amazon.com the parts pictured on the assembly sheet was so small I could not tell with a magnifying glass, Visual was needed because the instructions were so poorly written, on a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 3, they should have put stickers on the parts if they had a brain that way a person would not be looking at the parts scratching their head, this is the first thing in my life I had to use the instructions ....."
4,susieq,The Black and Decker workmate was a gift for my son this Christmas. He was very please to receive it as a gift. He has not had the time to use it yet but I will let you know when he does. It is Black and Decker so it has a good reputation.He actually wanted this bench last year for Christmas but it was not affordable at that time. Amazon sent an email notifying me that it was on sale. It was purchased five minutes later. If you do not have a wish list on Amazon I highly recommend you use one for upcoming sales on items you wish to purchase.
2,Wow...what a disappointment!!,"I have always wanted one of these since they look so useful. When I got it, I was really disappointed. The metal edges are razor sharp...even the cheap plastic parts have sharp edges. Assembly instruction is poorly written with pictures so tiny that they are pretty much useless. Then when I tried to clamp a project (a 14"" X 12"" board), there is no way to get it clamped down securely. The adjustment options were either too big or too small to get all 4 clamps on it! I tried using only 2 clamps, but it was impossible to secure it, and I did not want to tighten it too much fearing the cheap plastic handle might break off. Do not look at this as hardware; it is not. The material of this product is very cheap...and it will not last if you treat it like a tool."
3,Black & Decker Workmate,"While still a handy tool to have around the house, it is not as heavy as the originals that had cast aluminum braces. Parts were missing in shipping due to the way B&D throws the parts into a flimsy box. But on a positive note, B&D support was great and they promptly sent the missing parts. This is worth having for the price, but I was sorry to see my old Workmate go."
4,only your imagination stops what it can do,"i dont have a ""real"" work bench and am in the process of rebuilding a home. This workmate holds my doors, windows, trim, siding etc. for cutting ,painting, shaping and fitting. Set up and tear down is very fast holding items stable which is essential for any type of percise cuts. An added plus it is safer when the material is held properly hands free. i can move the workmate all around the home site inside and out as needed with ease saving me time and hassles. The workmate is lightweight, sturdy for a reasonable price.I should have got one ages ago!Still getting more use out of my workmate and it has held up well to the abuse i have put it through. It is like having an extra set of hands that u dont have to worry about hitting with a hammer or sharpe edge :)Because i am far from an expert handyman sometimes."
2,Quality Is Going Down,"Purchased a Workmate 30 years ago. This is not your father's Workmate. The metal frame is thinner, the springs weaker and shorter, the rear jaw is not movable any more, and even the wood for the jaws is thinner. Perhaps the WM425 is better quality, but the picture looks like it has the same thickness of metal."
4,Easy to use,"It's set a little differently than an earlier model we'd had for nearly 20 years but still does what we need it to do. It's a great little workbench or extra pair of ""hands"" to hold a piece of wood that needs cutting. It does not hold well enough to use as a clamp when gluing something, however."
2,not well made,"this is a wanna be workmate. I own one I purchased 25 years ago, it is still functional and much better made than the new model. But of course the old model was made in this country, not china !!"
4,Solid performer,"Skeptical having read the reviews of this product, I am pleasantly surprised by its performance. The assembly is simple, although the instructions are inadequate in size and detail. I ended up looking at the large photo of the assembled product on the outside of the packing box and that made the process easy. I did not find the plastic handles on the turnscrews to be flimsy. I have handled 10 foot pieces of lumber without a problem. Storage is simple and it takes up little space. I recommend the B&D workbench."
5,Workmate,This product lives up to it's name. My workmate is like having an extra set of hands to steady my projects and help me get better results safely.
3,NOT THE SAME AS MY LAST ONE.,The metal frame is made very well. The instructions to put it together are difficult to read. The print is very small & not easy to follow. Too much plastic in the parts. Haven't used it yet - hope it stays together.
4,Awesome!,This little work-mate is just the right size for those little projects at home where I otherwise would have had to seek out a helper to hold the item being worked on. It's easy to store and light-weight.Perfect!
5,Great Product,"Actually this was a Christmas gift for my son, but I have one just like it. It's a great product and I would recommend to anyone who needs a extra hand while working around the house. It is a great help and supports just about anything you can throw at it."
1,Not worth your time or money,Save your money.Interesting general information but you can get the same information by talking to a few different dealers and or other RV'ers.
5,Culdee creek,What wonderful continuing story. I'm anxious to see it to it's end. But I'm sure I'll be sad to see Brides of Culdee conclusion.
4,Lady of Light (brides of Culdee Creek,"I had a very difficult time getting into the story from Book 2. The story was over in Scotland, quite different language and I guessI don't care for the Scotish slang. The story got quite a bit better after the move to America. I wondered how else the Scotishheritage could've been put in the story. I did read it all and enjoyed it after the first chapter or two."
5,FABULOUS,Just another really amazing book by my favorite author. A touching tale that can really suck you in. Bravo! Bravo!
4,Very Good,I enjoy this type of books and like the Christian message in this book. I am reading more ofKathleen's books
3,I'm not a big fan of historical fiction...,"... and this series is no different. I find it very hard to connect with characters - they are just ""too good"" to the point of being unreal. The plot is entirely predictable. I read the first three books in this series because my book club chose them. They were fine, but I wouldn't chose to read them on my own."
5,Lady of Light Brides of Culdee Creek,Lady of Light is the 3rd book of this series and set in Scottland. The old world charm and romance comes together when Evan McKay finds what he has been looking for all his life. Love and the Lord.
3,Not as good as the previous books.,"I was disappointed in this book. It did not measure up to the previous books. They were written better and the books seemed complete at the end (even though its a series). There were too many character questions that were left unanswered. Ian's problems, Conors reaction to Beth and Ian's relationship, etc. The writing seemed rushed."
5,Lady Of Light,This was a great example of superior writing. You can't help falling in love with the characters while your spiritual life gets a makeover and reevaluation. What a worthy read that will keep you turning pages well past your bedtime. Thank you Kathleen for this magnificent literary work of art.
4,liked the book,"Easy read. fast moving, no null moment i would recommend this book for christian young ladies to read. good story line"
5,Inspiring Christian romance!,I loved reading Evan's story after Hannah and Devlin's. I enjoyed seeing this young couple grow and how God worked in their lives to teach them how blessed a marriage can truly be when given to Him.
4,Still reading but Love it so far,"I'm still actually reading this book, but I just love the whole series so far! They are just so great, and allow me to slip back in time (kind of) to a more simpler time when all that really mattered was family and God."
3,Good book a bit predictable,Good story but I thought it was too similar to the second book. I would have liked to hear more about Ian. Still - it was nice seeing closure between characters from other stories.
4,"Lady of Light (Brides of Culdee Creek, Book 3)",Lady of Light is a wonderful story. I loved reading the Scottish dialect in this book and learning about the culture of this particular time period.
5,great book,This is a great story. Really enjoying getting to know all of the characters. Sure hope the books keep coming! Thank you!
3,I liked it,"I am not sorry for buying the series, but it did not grip me like some books do. It was very nice for relazed reading."
5,Third book,I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to start the next book. Almost sad that will be t he last one
4,"Lady of light (brides of culdee creek, book 3)",I enjoyed this book just as much as the first two. Good story's with insight into our honest struggles in this life spiritually and emotionally.
3,"Light on travel, heavy on self examination","Don't approach this book as a sequel to Jupiter's Travels. Ted spends much of the book in self examination and oftentimes, self doubts. The story of his journey is interesting, and I found Ted's self realizations and gypsy spirit refreshing and engaging. Overall, even with the heavy philosophy it was a little sad to finish the book, and Ted's journey."
3,Not nearly as good as Jupiter's Travels,"This book contains two things: 1) The South and Central American portion of his trip that he skipped in Jupiter's Travels, and the other half is about him trying to build a house and start a family in California while reflecting on his journey. Skip this one and pick up Jupiter's Travels."
1,Versa Pack,"I guess it would have worked, but the whole Dust Buster would not charge so the Versa Pack was usless. Would like to retuern if possible.dappleb8@yahoo.comBlack and Decker VP105 VersaPak 3.6-Volt 1.2 Amp Hour NiCad Stick Style Battery, 2 Pack (Purchased on 09/14/2008)by Black & Decker"
5,best battery buy,could not get these anywhere in the area that i live. this was a great price and fast delivery
5,"Black and Decker VP105 VersaPak 3.6-Volt 1.2 Amp Hour NiCad Stick Style Battery, 2 Pack","I got these to replace vp100 VersaPak, Amazon had the best price and deliverywas fast."
1,Low power for the replacement 3.6v I ordered,The new Versapak battery I recieved was weaker than the origional five year old battery I still had. One of the two origional batteries quit working and I ordered a new one. The new one delivered only about half the torque to my screw driver and did not last long even after overnight charge. Perhaps I could have just recieved a defective one. I like the B&D cordless driver and will try again to order another one.
3,Good for around the house jobs,"I've got a number of versapack tools--drill, flashlight, Wizard, and multipurpose saw. I've found them useful for little short jobs around the house--light and easy to use. The problem is that the batteries run dead almost immediately, so I've ended up having to have a lot of spares charged for those occasiona when I need a tool for more than a few minutes. It's still cheaper than buying a higher end cordless, and since the tools are so light, for small jobs they are a lot nicer to use."
5,Great Product,I've had to throw out dust busters in the past due to the batteries failing. This was a great idea by B&D and everything is running like new.
1,Meh.,"Having read this book I will say that, while I liked a bit of the artwork associated, I was rather underwhelmed by the authors writing, as his general penmanship came across as difficult on the eyes. Having said this, The content of the book itself, while well thought out, seemed to lack a real depth of knowledge. Some of the more well versed authors have information which covers a very, very deep body of knowledge; I just didn't get that from this, but perhaps that wasnt the point of this book. All in all I was im sorry to say, negatively impressed."
5,"Lively, joyful CD","I heard this CD at a friend's house once, years ago, and spent five years searching for it since. It showed up in Amazon this year, and I now, finally!, own it for myself.I LOVE this CD! It pays homage to the original, but brings a lively, joyful, unique sound to the musical ideas Handel started with. It modernizes it without degrading it in any way. I still love the original (Tafelmusik's is my favourite rendition, as true to the original ideas as possible), but I love this adaptation equally as much. Some top-name musicians perform here, too, and I love hearing them add their creative ideas to this project.5 stars, for sure!"
5,Groovin' With The Messiah!,"This is our tree trimming music now- and has been ever since I found it quite by accident a few years ago while trying to learn the Rejoice solo. I must admit that THIS Rejoice is the best, and I know it enhanced my, definitely more traditional, performance. Methinks perhaps that the reviewer for Amazon was a tad proud of him/herself the day the review was written. After a couple of egg nogs that reviewer will be groovin' with the rest of us!"
5,"How to make you holiday season ""Soulful Celebration""","I love this album and wore out a cassette tape listening to it several times a year. Handel's Messiah has always been one of my favorites, but this is an awesome transformation of the original, and you can't say that very often. You can hear the magic as the ""Hallelujah Chorus"" starts. My favorites are; ""But Who May Abide the Day of His Coming"" and ""I Know That My Redeemer Liveth"". This album will make your Christmas season truly ""soulful!"""
4,Soulful Celebration review,I particularly enjoy the Handel's Messiah. The choir that I sing with did this particular piece (not as well as the CD of course). I think we will do it again Christmas time. Other songs we good also. But my favorite if the Handel's Messiah.
3,The best cut is the Hallelujah Chorus,"I had heard the Hallelujah Chorus before (it was played in my spinning class at Christmas time) so I knew how great a song it is. I was hoping that the rest of the album was close to that level of inspiration and excitement - but I was disappointed. I liked the first cut (a short history of Black music in America) and a couple other cuts, but the Hallelujah Chorus is definitely the best. Most of the others are just so - so, in my opinion. Still the album is worth getting, just for the Hallelujah Chorus!"
3,Hits and misses,"This disc has some great tracks (""Comfort Ye My People"" is beautiful, and I dare you to stay still during the ""Hallelujah!"" Chorus), but there are also some skippers (""Every Valley Shall Be Exalted"" is too cheesy for my tastes--and you're right, Amazon reviewer, the rap IS embarrassing). I think the attempt to diversify as much as possible hurt the disc overall. But still recommended."
4,Excellent purchase,Excellent musical assemblage- new spin on iconic music. Dealer delivered promptly and in good condition
1,Lost,"This product was the first item I ordered for Christmas. It is now December 27th and the package was scheduled to be received on December 1st. I am not only disappointed in the quality of the service, but upset that I ordered a Christmas cd that I won't be able to enjoy until next year, because as of today I still do not have the item."
1,complete and utter crap,"This dubious mess has the distinction of being one of the most tasteless and atrocious pieces of exploitative junk the philistines of the world have ever foistered upon the music loving public.I like Black American music in general and I am a Baroque musician, myself. Yet this mix of the two is simply horrible and senseless.I am not sure what sort of person this miserable and jejune recording is aimed at? Handel lovers will hate it with a passion, Baroque music fans will be reaching for their sick bags, fans of Soul, Funk, Hip-Hop, Gospel and Jazz should know better!This recording is disgusting, tastless, exploitative, foolish, misguided, vile, disrespectful, stupid, ignorant and, above all, the work of a group of utter PHILISTINES!Oh! I forgot to say it before but this recording is crap. If it wasn't why hasn't it been copied by others?Handel was a great composer and to treat his music in this way is more than disrespectful, it is stupid."
2,Was disappointed,I bought this CD because of the great reviews and didn't like it at all. Too loud and abrasive for my ears... I gave it away to someone who might better like it.I expected it to be mellifluous and soulful but found it rather annoying... especially at the holidays.
1,Yawn,"Longing for a recording of ""Handel's"" Messiah stripped of all of its classical majesty and beauty? Your search is over! This disc sounds like the producers fed the score into one of those computer programs designed to spit out the kind of banal, inoffensive muzak that blares from department store speakers. This isn't ""authentic"" black music - it's a mangling of a masterpiece. If you're looking for African-American music of amazing beauty and power, purchase Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman's outstanding recording ""Spirituals in Concert"", or any of Marian Anderson's, Paul Robeson's, or Leontyne Price's splendid recordings."
5,"excellent, excellent cd","there is nothing more i could say about this cd that the other reviewers haven't already mentioned - it is a must have for anyone, even if you are not a fan of christian music. i had never even heard of this project - i bought it soon after it came out, simply because i liked the cover art and thought it would be a good cd to have around christmas. it's better than that - i listen to it year round. every song, no matter what style, is delivered with all heart and soul possible. excellent lift-you-up music, and great to listen to in the mornings to get you pumped up for the day. ""and he shall purify"" is simply electrifying. i am also a big fan of the final song, ""halleluja!"" and ""but who may abide the day of his coming"" will just set you free! year round, this is an outstanding example of gospel, jazz, hip-hop and absolute zeal for any music lover."
3,What is there is good,"I thought there would be more than the Christmas portion.Hallelujah chorus was the best partI bought the disk because we had recently sung Hallelujah in choir, so I was not disappointed by that aspect"
1,"pretty good, if you like dumd games",This game [stinks] so bad it blows. It is one of the very worst games i've ever played. I's so boring a person with ansomnia would fall asleep. [The price] is a hideously high price for such a dumb game. I hate it like a leech. If you like boring and overpriced games buy it. I bought it and threw it away. Dumb overpriced and boring pretty much describes virtual bart. Virtual Bart gets my vote for worst game of the century.
2,Worst Game,"Whats wrong with this game? Everything is the answer, and if you didn't think that by yourself just by reading the title you should read this reviewWhere to start? I know the beginning! The beginning really shows you just how much bad you are in store for. It shows a dumb movie then you have to spin a wheel that always lands on the worst level, (all of them). The game is so easy you could beat it with you eyes closed after 36 hours without sleep, i know because i did. This game is way over rated by the other reviews. You may be wondering why i gave it 2 stars it makes a great shoe horn, but you should buy the plastic ones, they are excellent, and revenge of shinobi rules!"
1,"bad, bad, bad ,game",I didn't like it at all.Completely boring right down to the last level. i bought it because i was bored but that game didn't help one bit. I gave it tomy brother i have no idea what he did with it. I think he liked it but he's 3.
2,zzz zzz zzz,(yawn) What!!! Oh yea. Virtual bart is boring.It's very good i use it when i can't fall asleep. But as in fun never use fun and virtual bart in the same sentance without have bad in the sentance. Geez it's so horrible howcould so much bad be in one game. And they are proffesionals. I disagree with that other guy barneys hide and seek is way better.
4,Good product,"This is a nice glaze, which is a syrupy, reduced balsamic vinegar. It tastes good and is useful in many recipes."
5,Great item for the kitchen!,A wonderful balsamic glaze that heightens the taste of many different items. Comes in a 6-pack so there is plenty around all the time! Fast shipping and very reasonable price.
1,LOL,"This is just totally ridiculously. Why would you want to kill your southern accent, or any other accent for that matter. Is there a book, ""Tame Your Wild Northern Accent""? Probably not. This book sterotypes Southerners based on their accent. Keep your accent. Life is too short to worry about such foolishness."
4,Ok,"It has information on both sides, so we can not hang it like a poster. Not sure what we are going to do with it right now."
5,A Book that must be read,"This is a book that must be read by anyone interested in the Holocaust and Jewish life. It is unlike any Holocaust autobiography in that it involves Jewish life in South America. Even after living through the tragedies of the Holocaust Salomon Encourages joy and happiness. As a College student, and as Salomon's grandson this book touched my life in a very special way."
5,Not to be missed excellent bakery cookbook.!,"As a pastry chef and cookbook collector, the best thing I can say is: ""Hurry up, get this book""!- My partner, also a professional baker, didn't wait 2 minutes to order it after she looked through mine. We can recognize a well written, entertaining and useful cookbook, this is one that you don't want to miss. The recipes are well written, with easy to follow instructions and easy to find ingredients-."
5,Best ever!,"This is my go to for pastries lately. The pie crust recipe is fantastic! I can't wait to experiment with some of the tougher pastries. She does a good job of telling what use to go wrong with her, and how she learned the right way. Disasters in the bakery, etc. Cute read along with amazing recipes."
5,Great guide,This is a very good baking book and guide for someone who wants to learn how to make baked goods they would normally not know how to make. Instructions are straight forward and easily understandable.
2,No baker's percentages,"I cannot understand why books like this are still published. It uses the cup-system, which is a way of measuring ingredients by volume. This yields inaccurate recipes, period. And it took me quite a while to figure out the corrrect percentages to get a recipe right. They are only usable for someone who is either very eperienced or happy to find out by trial and error (or someone who uses exactly the same flour at the same time of year in the same region as the author).Why, Gayle and Ortiz, why?2 stars for the effort and nice printing."
3,A fun stocking stuffer.,"""Here's looking at you, kid."" ""What a dump!"" ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" ""Make my day."" ""You talkin' to me?"" ""I've got a mind for business and a bod for sin."" This can go on forever! And this slim volume goes on forever with some humorous and/or memorable lines from THE TRILOGY. But the best and wisest quotes come from Yoda and Obi Wan. This is a nice stocking stuffer -- and it's priced right. A nickel more and I'd have a bad feeling about this."
3,"Mediocre, but still slightly fun","This game has it's good points and bad points.Yay:- The sexy ninja girls.- The cool weapons.- The unique puzzles.- The hilarious violence.Nay:- The horrible controls.- The headache-inducing gameplay.- The lack of AI.All in all, your enjoyment of this game relys on how long you're willing to put time into playing it. Not a bad game, but if you're craving hyper-violent ninja action, try Tenchu instead."
4,Red Ninja PS2,Red Ninja is an awesome game. much like tenchu but has afew of its own twists. for some reason the when the main charactor is running though once in awhile she trips over nothing not sure if its a glitch or what. One thing i liked abot this game is that the background story is true there realy was a kunoichi (female ninja) named Chiyome in the 1500s of Japan and some of the events in the game actually did happen. Some things of coarse are a little far fetched but hey its a video game is wouldnt be fun if they wern't
3,"Potential, but that's it.","In theory, running around in a skimpy outfit strangling people and cutting them in half seems to almost guarantee an enjoyable gaming experience. However, when this is combined with nearly impossible controls and direction-less gameplay, it will entertain you long enough to allow for some graphics appreciation and clothing admiration (if you can call it clothing), and that's about it. If the controls allowed for better accessibility, it could turn out to be a decent game, but as it is you will be lucky to finish it, let alone enjoy it."
1,Nice concept. Lousy execution.,"Clunky controls and lousy camera angles make this a truly frustrating experience. Boss fights are tedious and frustrating rather than challenging. The combat system could use some major improvements. Blocking, for instance, is nearly useless. The seduction ability only seems to succeed at random and is also next to useless. There aren't many games that I would throw in the trash, but I think I will make an exception for this one."
3,Meh...,This was an alright buy. . . The whole thing is made out of what feels like weak plastic and the tip bends and breaks easily. I wouldn't recommend. :/
5,Under-cover Brush,"Got three of these brushed. Great. Made one myself from a lint roller. But love this one better.Got one for my son and daughter, even though he shaves his head. Good to have just in case."
3,DON'T TAKE IT TO THE AIRPORT,"Airport security can see it easily. A concealed weapon such as this is, I believe, a felony.Nice brush, dagger might deter someone as a threat, or they might take it away & hurt you with it if you're not trained."
4,Tough and Sharp!,"OK I got pretty much what I was expecting. Very hard composite material. Very sharp. Extremely lightweight. Looks like you average hairbrush.The ""blade"" does not lock into place but does a rather nice job of staying put with pressure and friction. It looks like it would penetrate 4 inches of flesh as well as any blade with a good stabbing motion. It is a stabbing implement.Do not expect true hairbrush bristles but instead they are the same hard composite material. The bristles are more stiff than flexible but, lets be real.... This is a weapon disguised as a hairbrush. Weapon first, hairbrush second. My wife said, ""It's not the most comfortable brush to use."" I reminded her.. It's a weapon that just so happens to look like a hairbrush. Doesn't mean it doesn't work.I paid 8 dollars and change and feel it's money well spent. It's inconspicuous in my wife's purse and is a nice addition to pepper spray."
5,Oh so easy to use and store!,"I have to weigh nutritional items such as amino acids. This little scale makes it so easy! I place the container I want the measured substance to end up in on the scale, with the funnel in it if needed. Then I turn the scale on and push the oz/gram button so it will measure in grams. The scale is then zeroed with the container weight ignored. Then I can add the substance and measure the exact weight of it in 10ths of a gram. I LOVE that I don't have to measure on the scale and then transfer to my container- losing some of it in the process! Clean-up is effortless. It looks like a big compact (you know, like for pressed facial powder) and slips into most any small space in a drawer for storage. Notice though- this scale is small and will only weigh a maximum of 8 oz!"
3,It's no secret that this is a good sequel,Shadow Dancer is a sequel to the Revenge Of Shinobi so I guess Sega couldn't wait for an offical sequel to come along so they decided to port Shadow Dancer from the arcades to the Genesis Shadow Dancer arcade is a sequel to Shinobi arcade. Shadow Dancer plays more like Shinobi in the arcades & abandons the Revenge Of Shinobi gameplay. Story for the game is a few years after the defeat of the NEO ZEED a new & more dangerous group called Union Lizard has taken over The NYC the game is set in a post apocalyptic NYC in 1997 ok what was it with 1997 being the year of death in the day you know Escape from New York T2 this game I'm reviewing. Any way You & a Dog named Yamto set off to destroy the Union Lizard. Shadow Dancer is a good sequel but the music doesn't touch the Yuzo Kashiro's that he composed for Revenge of Shinobi because you got something special if Yuzo Kashiro composes for a video game.
2,ENOUGH ALREADY!,"THIS TIME, DAVID SLOAN [SASHA MITCHELL] IS FRAMED FOR MURDER. IN ORDER TO GAIN HIS FREEDOM, DAVE MUST ENTER A TOURNAMENT AND BRING TONG PO TO JUSTICE. WELL, ONE THING IS DEFINITELY TRUE; SASHA MITCHELL IS DEFINITELY NO JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME. THIS SEQUEL LOOKS LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN ''ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK'' AND ''ENTER THE DRAGON''. THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE LAST TWO MOVIES, BUT STILL, IT AIN'T NOWHERE NEAR AS ENTERTAINING AS THE FIRST. THOUGH THIS IS TOLERABLE, THEY REALLY NEED TO GIVE THIS SERIES A REST. YA GOTTA ADMIT, TONG PO'S THICK ACCENT IS VERY HILLARIOUS."
3,"Almost a romance novel, but a little better, a little deeper","Although Kavaler's style occasionally seems better suited to a romance novel than this pseudo-feminist adventure story, her accounts of the suffrage movement and polar exploration are gripping. I lost patience quickly with the protagonists' weaknesses for a ""certain kind of man"" (i.e., a macho jerk) but found the plot twists and period details mesmerizing."
5,Must Have,"This is a must have in any shop. With all the sawdust, even with vacuume system, that is in the shop as well as just the everyday dust. This keeps your wheels nice and clean."
4,Very nice general-purpose machine cover,"I just hate the dust that inevitably builds up on my benchtop machines. These small covers work great to keep dust off bench grinders, benchtop mortisers, scroll saws, sharpeners, and the like. I bought 8 of these using Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion, and am very pleased. There is a small velcro-closure opening in the top of the cover that allows use with handled tools, like a small drill press or mortiser.I would give it 5 stars if it didn't grab the stones on my grinders like velcro (as another reviewer mentioned). Still, I am satisfied."
3,"Looks nice, but hard to put on","The fabric sticks to the shapening stone like velcro, so it is hard to get on and off. I have taken to covering the stone with a shop cloth before putting the cover on to make it a little easier.It isn't really custom shaped for the Jet Wet Sharpener. It is just baggy enough that it works. It might work on several different tools."
2,Needless accessory,"I thought the cover looked pretty cool in the product listing and would be a usefull extra. However, the cover is much larger that the unit, so it looks pretty sloppy and since I have extensive dust collection in my shop, there is no issue with keeping the unit clean. NIce red...up to you."
2,From a Chess Teacher,"I teach chess in the public schools in California and purchased this and several other books to provide problems and lesson plans.The Chess Kid's Book of Tactics contains some good problems for students. It is lacking in quantity and contains numerous mistakes.It's weakest point is that it provides some sames without showing in many cases where the errors were made. For a strong player using the book as a teaching tool this isn't a serious problem. However, for a student reading the book his or herself this is a major flaw.Overall the book isn't so bad. However, there are several better books available on tactics for students and chess teachers out there."
2,Somewhat Useful Book,"After reading CHESS FOR JUNIOIRS (also a David McKay Book - I highly recommed it as a first book) I got THE KID'S BOOK OF TACTICS as my second book.It gives a nice sample of different positions using important tactical ideas in the most simple form. I found the problems to be to easy for me and wanted something that was more challenging.There are some comments on the sample games used, but in most cases the moves are without comments and knowing where the good and bad moves are made is not pointed out.Even with these weaknesses I would say the book is ok."
1,POOR COMMENTARY AND CONTAINS ERRORS,"I was rather disapointed after getting the CHESS KID'S BOOK OF TACTICS. The several errors I found in the book could have been forgiven if it wasn't for the lack of explanation, which is important when teaching kids.The games within the book have very little analysis or explanation of the ideas behind the moves. When an extremely strong or weak move is made the book handles it with NO COMMENT!It does indeed look like this book was tossed together quickly. For kids deep commentary isn't need, but basic commentary telling what the ideas are where the good and bad moves are (with suggested improvements) must be provided for the proper teaching of kids. This book is very lacking."
3,Acceptable book if you have some acumen for tactics,"I've seen the bad reviews and I can understand why they've been written. I am an amateur chess player and have coached chess in the public schools. I am in the process of teaching my son to play. As a result, I didn't find the book particularly difficult or hard to understand. Saw the mistakes, but most books have 'em nowadays, so I'm not particularly persuaded one way or the other on that point.On that note, I wouldn't give it to my wife, who is not a chess player, because it wouldn't be very helpful for her for many of the reasons already cited in previous reviews. I will probably use some of the examples with my son, but if you're not already well-versed in tactics and you want to help your chess playing child, there are better books out there."
2,"Certainly not a ""best buy""","When I got this book I was excecting more content. This book must have been put together in a few days. Just because it is a book written for kids doesn't mean it has to lack content and have so many oversized diagrams to take up space.The actual material, however, is ok, which is why I could justify not giving it one star. There are many good books with tactics out there that have a lot more problems to work on. My favorite is WINNING CHESS TACTICS FOR JUNIORS."
1,Lots of mistakes and lacks analysis,"I found this book to have a fair number of mistakes in it. However, even if you forgive the mistakes the sample games that tie in to the positions give many horrible moves without pointing them out."
4,"Lots of tactics, and not as bad as most reviewers say.","Most of the reviews that I saw about this book were incorrect. Yes, I know that MacEnulty did not explain perfectly about each tactical idea, but he did explain what each tactic was, and how to find it. But for a book that just gives you frames to work by yourself after some explained examples, there's just not enough.I suggest that advanced players should get Josh Waitzkin's Attacking Chess if they want to have each tactic and idea explained clearly to them.I give the book 4 stars, because I enjoyed reading it."
1,Wish I could give a 0 rating,"A big miss - two thumbs down. Got this book for my kid and he didn't like it, so I gave it a closer look.Here is what I found:Almost no comments to the games inside. Not a teaching book. The author often gives a ? to a move but doesn't tell why. Makes me and my kid scratch out heads! Confusing. So we aren't Bobby Fischer at chess, but this book should help us here!There are some obvious mistakes in the book that make it clear that either the author never got a chance to proof read his own book or that he doesn't know what he is doing."
2,Looking it over and using it,"I have spend over a week using this book. I think this is an honest review. I can understand why it has two stars by others. The author has probably tried his best but the problem is that there are better tactics books and I own a couple. One is the Reinfeld book, 1001 Winning sacrifics and combinations and the other is Seraswans book on tactics. They have more things and tell me better why they work.I do chess class after school in New York City and have heard good things about the author of this book. He is not my chess teacher but am sure he would do good as my teacher in person. So you might still want to buy this book because my ranking by stars is only due to other better books like it but the book is ok."
2,Chess kids book of tactics,Most of the games do not show where the mistakes were made and all of the games do not have notes to them to tell what is happening. If a move is bad it should have a question mark and tell you what was correct. I wanted a book that would explain things to me.
3,Only one shock per order. NOT a pair as shown in the photo,Note that this is only ONE shock. There are two in the picture so I assumed I was buying a pair of shocks. Buyer beware.
2,Not worth the price,"I have a Labrador who loves taking daily swims in our ponds, so keeping her dry is constantly an issue. I have found that my fluffy cotton towels (1/2 the price of this one) do a comparable job. The red color also seems to bleed profusely when washing."
3,beware of the pink!,"I agree that these are great towels, for dogs or for humans. I wouldn't buy this particular one again, though. Once it's at all damp, it bleeds red/pink dye on everything it touches. (Thank goodness I don't have a white dog!) I like this product, but wouldn't get another red one. I actually like the waffle weave (human)version the best."
5,best towel in the house!,"it goes to show how spoiled our dog is when his towel is the best in the house! it's big, it's really absorbent, and washes just fine. didn't have the problems with dye that others have mentioned. but anytime it's raining we keep this by the door and it works great!"
3,"Absorbent, but full of dye!","This is a very absorbent towel, as advertised. It's a good size, too. But the first time I washed it, it bled all over my jeans and stained the inside of my dryer. The good thing is I learned how to clean my dryer. But I'm not looking forward to washing this again."
5,A must if you wash your dog at home.,"I have a Boston Terrier who I wash at home once a week. It takes his fur forever to dry. With this towel, I can get him almost completely dry, it is amazing. There is something about the red color he likes too. He knows it is his blanket and likes to be wrapped in it. hmm. Not sure if they did that on purpose but it sure makes bath time a bit easier. This towel is a must if you wash your dog at home."
1,Poor packaging,"I purchased this dinnerware set for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived with broken plates. I returned the order and ordered a replacement set. It arrived with broken plates, so much so that I didn't even open the box, I could hear the broken pieces when I brought the package inside the house. I've ordered quite a few Pfaltzgraff items in the past, and have never had a problem with broken dishes. I would not recommend this item because of this problem. I'm not sure that I will order anymore dishes from Amazon if this is the way they will arrive."
1,VersaPak Battery/charger,"I have four of these chargers, only one works. The batteries that came with them lasted about 50-75 charges, not 300. They are all dead, leaving me with usless chuck drill, hedge trimmer, screwdriver, mini grinder, recip saw and a light. These tools cost at least $300 and for lack of a good set of batteries, all are usless! That is why I was looking at this charger/battery offer. I decided to pass......"
5,Versa Pak batteries,Not much to reate. They're batteries used in versa pak tools and they work fine.
1,AMAZON IS LYING,"I made an order of this product at Nov 25, 2004. Today is Dec 02, 2004 and the product is still not shipped. The order page says it's delayed but the product page still says ""Availability: Usually ships within 24 hours"" It's truely disapointing that Amazon lies like this. Now If I order it from other place it'll be too late. I'm so disapointed by Amazon now."
3,Too small,I bought this item for a friend whose bowl I had broken. His complaint was that the bowl was too small.
5,Awesome!,These chips are awesome! We moved from Southern California a few years ago and really missed our Have'a Chips...thanks to Amazon we don't miss them anymore!
2,Blech,"Even though the chips arrived at least a month before their expiration date, the aroma of rancid oil assaulted my nose on the first bag. The chips tasted stale and bland. Just to be thorough, I checked several more bags and found them all to be inedible. Thank goodness for curbside composting. It will take a while to work up the nerve to try these again."
3,Not enough goodies for the money,"I used to eat these chips like it was going out of style. However, of late, the bags in the store (in this case, Whole Foods) have been about one-fifth full of broken chips, chip fragments and chip dust. They aren't cheap, the bag doesn't contain that much in the first place and I can't afford to pay for this much ""breakage"" no matter how tasty they are."
5,BEST CHIP'S EVER,"I can't get enough of these chips!!! I had my family order them, then spend the extra $60 to ship them to Kuwait while i was deployed. Wish they would ship oversea's or at least to APO AE(hint hint). In Texas now, and I have to keep the chip's coming in.**WARNING** EXTREMELY DELICIOUS"
5,Made for children,"My 10 year old reads science fiction and no other stories. He took this book up feeling inquisitive and went on to finish the book, he really seems to have understood the need of organizational skill for him to continue to succeed in the latter parts of school year (by which time his desk is filled with papers)"
3,Cute - but they have to want it,"It was a cute book - my daughter thought it was ""interesting"". She flipped through it - but then more or less it got tossed in the heap of other books that she has. All in all - just because you want them to be organized - doesn't mean that a book is going to fix it. And that goes for all books on this subject.If you are looking for a miracle cure...there isn't one.If you are looking for maybe a hint or two - that may or may not stick with you child... Then go ahead and purchase the book - but to be honest - it would be cheaper to just borrow it - or something like it from the library.... After all it probably won't get looked at again after a week anyways."
3,organized smorganized,"This really didn't cover anything that doesn't come up all the time in our normal ""you need to be more organized"" conversations. It just repeated us. My son lost interest real fast. I asked him what he learned and he said ""I need to be organized"". Yep, kind of knew that already."
2,Not enough humor. Sounds like lecturing.,"I had higher expectations for this book because the other Laugh and Learn books were funny, especially the ""Do your Homework without Throwing Up"" one. I wish that it was more entertaining for kids so that they would want to read the book and enjoy reading it. I could barely get through this book myself because it was so dry and lecturing. The amount of stuff the author suggests you need to be organized is dizzying. I think this creates a barrier to entry for kids because they don't have all that stuff. My son would not read this book. However, he found the Homework one and Procrastinator ones worth reading. The kind of kid who would read this entire thing is already interested in being organized."
5,excellent,Great book to had to elementary kids. I would recommend having it in the library at school or giving the title to parents.
5,My daughter loves it!,"My middle-school daughter just absorbed this book, and even though it's her second year of middle school, she enjoys this book and is taking notes about the ideas in it. I'm recruiting her to write a blog post for me. Look for it in a few days![...]"
3,did not really like it,"There were a lot of cover songs and after awhile repetition of the chorus over and over again, gets boring. i would buy a greatest hits album but this was disappointing."
3,"Don't expect this to be like ""The Girl From Ipanema"" !","I didn't buy with that intention. This is actually a concept album. Jobim used ecology concerns as his subject. Though the title ""Urubu"" means turkey vulture in Portugese. How majestic is that? The first four titles feature Jobim and others on vocals. Then the last four instrumentals take on a impressionistDebussy/Ravel ambiance, featuring the lush orchestral arrangements of Claus Ogerman. There is not a bossa or samba to be found, so if your looking for that don't buy this. This album from 1976 is more a showcase for Ogerman than Jobim. The 7min.+ ""Saudade Do Brasil"" comes off best to me. The last selection "" O Homem""(Man) the shortest starts off promising then fizzles uneventfully to close the album. The whole project seems out of character for Jobim. Certainly this is not his finest hour! Add a star if you think his effort was worth it."
1,How do you say 'schmaltz' in Portugese?,"As a recent devotee of Brazilian Jazz, I was horrified by this album. Heavily orchestrated, only the few moments of Portugese being sung now and then made it sound at all Brazilian. And there was no trace of Jazz to it at all. It was more suitable for a soundtrack to a sappy soap opera than a quiet evening at home. If you like Brazilian Jazz, this ain't it."
3,Kenroy Home Foshan Chimes Tabletop Fountain,"This fountain is nice for decoration, however, if you're looking for a fountain that actually SOUNDS like one, I don't recommend this. It makes hardly any noise, which is why I was searching for a fountain to begin with."
5,Adorable pop-up book!,"Our Children's Librarian used this book for my daughter's ToddlerTime class the day that we planted sunflower seeds, and all the children LOVED ""Max Loves Sunflowers."" The bright colors, simple line-drawings and movement on every page captured the interest of all the two-year-olds in the class. I highly recommend this book for youngsters; kids can watch the sunflower ""grow"" from seed to seedling to a huge plant. Very entertaining, colorful, and fun!"
2,Not great,The velcro doesn't hold well. Better choice is the ACE WRIST BRACE NEOPRENE 7220. It is easy to put on and comfortable for sports (e.g. tennis) or work. Love this ACE brace and have told several friends who now use it.
2,Grip did not last,"This was fine for a month then the velcro started going bad and it would not stay in place properly. I do use it everyday at work and put it on and take it off quite often. It may be good if you plan on leaving it on your wrist for long periods but if you're like me and always taking them off, this is not for you. It did do it's job for the time it worked, it reduced my tendinitis while using it."
1,Weak Velcro,"I thought I'd gotten a great deal on this for the whole 3 days it took to wear out the velcro. Now the strap won't stay fastened for longer than a few minutes, to say nothing of the total lack of support. Don't waste your money!"
3,Not the best,Velcro rips wrap each time you use it. Should be fuzzy after a few uses. Otherwise does what it is made for.
3,NOT QUITE TIGHT ENOUGH,"BUT THEY CERTAINLY ARE BETTER THAN NOTHING. I PLAY ELECTRIC GUITAR AND MY WRISTS TEND TO NEED ""CRACKED"" NOT SURE HOW SAFE THAT IS SO I USE THESE TO HELP SUPPORT MY WRISTS"
2,It's OK,"This product is great in the beginning, but after it's worn a few times it starts to not be as effective and stick due to the velcro. The more you put it on and take it off it wears and won't stick. Basically good for a few wears and nothing beyond."
2,Quality is poor,"The quality of this product is very poor. After few weeks of using this Wrist Wrap, its trim already started peel off."
3,get what you pay for in this case,"Better than nothing ,after a few uses starts to lose grip, their is a much better one , amazon sells for $2.78-- the brand name starts with the letter S , see my other review."
1,Wrist band,I ordered this wrist band for my husband..... he is disatisfied with this wrist band..... no added support. A waste of time and energy finding a wrist band online... if I had known these two wrist bands weren't any good.. I would have never ordered them !!!!
3,AVERAGE REFERENCE,"I don't know why Don Holmes did so well in trail descriptions and then installed such poorly illustrated maps. Many look hand-drawn. He has cleverly added though interesting info including special conditions, historical and natural history notes to each area. I give this book a ""c""."
3,Dated but helpful,"Even though this book is somewhat dated (2000c), it has already helped us find a ""highpoint."" Since the Louisiana location is on private land, it was more difficult to find than most, many of which are in parks, etc. The book even had the telephone number of one of the land owners. We called her and got permission to hike. After hiking there and in Arkansas, we found that the trails are somewhat improved since the publication of the book. They were well maintained and well marked. Obviously, ""highpointing"" has continued to gain in popularity, so it seems that a new book or newer edition of this one would be in order. That said, this book is still helpful, and it seems to be one of the few out there. At the price, it's still worth the purchase."
5,A Fun Family Tree Book For All Ages,"This book earned every star in the rating scale shown above. I don't recall the last time I had such fun with an ""activity"" book. This little book consists of only 24 pages, however each page is filled with clear, easy to read text and plenty of space to fill in your family information. Every page is detailed with fun and colorful illustrations which hold the attention of even the youngest of readers.This book keeps it simple and easy for all ages to learn about who they are, where they came from and who they are related to.With ample room to include family photographs, this book is not only fun to fill out, but will also be a keepsake to share with those you love."
5,Sinatra at his most powerful and finest,"This album rates as on of my favourites. Sinatra's rendition of ""Night and Day"", ""Misty"" and others is stunning. By the early 1960s, recording technology had improved enough (stereo was standard, or at least common) and Sinatra's voice remained in fine form -- I prefer this to the boyish 1940s recordings, although these are treasurable on their own merits -- allowing the tonal splendor of the vocals to fill the room.""All or Nothing at All"" provides a marvelous contrast to the version with Harry James in 1939. Costa's arrangements are great.Highly recommended."
3,This is a cd that you will want to own,"This is a very delightful cd. This is the first of many Sinatra-Costa projects. This cd has a very good sound. The vocals and orchestra seem to blend together very well. Franks' ideas for this recording were super. He choose to record the old standards which is what really appeals to many people, including myself.The only complaint or concern i have for this record is the song selection. There were some songs on this cd that i didn't particularly like. Other than that i was completely satisfied with this cd.I Would Like To Recommend This Cd"
3,Sinatra and Strings,Much too lugubrious. Nice recording and it's Frank!....but too much of a good thing.
1,Cheap and chinsy,"Just got these in today for my dads Christmas present, they look nothing like the picture. They look like they were bent into shape with a pair of pliars. This is crap i should have just gone to the auto parts store, bought some tips and made them myself, they would of looked a heck of alot better. shipping was quick,(the reason for the one star) but thats besides the point when you get cheap crap like this."
2,"or less rating, for film variety & vid. quality.","the selections & film quality r mostly garbage; it was maybe only good for me to get what was only just barely ok-""beast of yellow night"", ""attack frm spce"" & ""teens frm outerspace""-the best of this film was the created skeletols & lobstershadows. any other good films here?-i just dont know nor believe so yet. i may not have the time to say. overpriced item."
3,Great value for b-movie fans.,"This collection would be more suitably named something other than ""Sci-Fi Classics"" None of the films here are classics in any sense of the word and many of them aren't even sci-fi, but the set does cover an awful lot of territory for a very reasonable price. There is everything here from an early silent movie to 1950's cold-war paranoia alien invasion films, and from Steve Reeves Hercules escapades all the way to Amazon warrior women and giant spiders. I've always been a fan of these kinds of movies and there are a few unexpected gems buried here. As someone mentioned, the transfer quality is iffy and sometimes truly horrible in that some of the films appear to have come from second or even third-generation VHS copies. Nevertheless I'm looking forward to spending the occasional Sunday afternoon with a bag full of popcorn happily viewing something from this rather eclectic collection."
3,Save yourself some money...,"Its a real good collection of cheese fest sci-fi films for the B movie fan, but this collection is simply the ""Sci-fi"" 50 pack combined with the ""Nightmare Worlds"" 50 pack. Together they'll run you about $25. So save yourself about $15 and just get the two 50 packs separately."
5,Great Product!,"All those corny SciFi movies you never thought you'd watch all in one convenient collection! Hahaha. Some are really good and some are painfully boring, but it's a great collection to have, especially for those that don't have cable or anything (like me). Keep me entertained while doing household chores and help me relax at night before bed :)"
4,"""Nightmare Worlds"" 50 movies included in collection","I purchased ""Sci Fi Classics 100 Movie Pack"" together with ""Nightmsre Worlds 50 Movie Pack Collection"". I was disappointed to find that ""nightmare Worlds"" was ENTIRELY included in the ""Sci Fi"" collection. In fact, half the disks have the ""Nightmare Worlds"" menu and half another menu. The combination of the 2 should have been mentioned in the product description. However, the price was cheap so it's no great loss. I'll give ""Nightmare Worlds as a gift. Quality and movie selection is poor, but I expected that having bought another collection from the company. Some of the movies elevate Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" to Oscar level acting. However, some are interesting like seeing Richard Hatch (from Battlestar Galctica-original and new series)in a movie earlier in his acting career."
4,Funky low budget movies,"This product consists of an eclectic collection of low budget fiction/fantasy/scifi movies, some that are so bad that they are good. Keep in mind that none of them appear to be restored or cleaned up in any perceptible fashion. It is fun seeing some well-known actors that likely started out (or ended up) in these less-than-stellar films. Regardless, they make great Saturday night beer & popcorn viewing. Best of all, you can't beat the price of 20 cents a movie even with some being bombs.November 2011 Update: I have finally managed to watch over half of the movies in this collection. Some look like they were student films (using friends and family for actors and done around their home), some were made for TV, some were serial compilations from the 30's and 40's and some were actual low-budget Hollywood productions. A few were so badly made (usually due to an abysmal script and/or acting) that I only watched them for 10-15 minutes."
1,classic sci-fiction lover,out of all the videos in this box. There are only three or four DVD's in this box. That are worth my time watching. I can pick much better old time science fiction movies. If I were allowed to pick them myself. Bottom line skip this box set
1,100 SCI-FI movie pack,"Really disappointed, all moview were poor quality, would not recommend this collection, granted the flicks were old but no digital enhancement whatsoever."
1,crap,"worst collection i have ever watched, they could have put better b-movies of the 40's and 50's instead of the italian and japanese crap they put in there! t.borders"
3,Sci Fi Classics 100 Movie Pack,"It got three stars because it is more fantasy than Science Fiction. There is nothing Sci-Fi about The Son of Hercules. Some of the movies are CLASSICS and some are not! Nuff said. Truthfully, I am only half way through the deck, and so far, I have not found any that rate being a frisbee. If any oldsters remember Elvira's movie show, most of these would and have been on her show."
2,Sci-Fi? Phooey!,"Yes, the headline is a little harsh, but honestly, I can't recommend this title.I wasn't expecting great quality. I wasn't expecting great movies. But I was expecting it to be mostly science fiction. That just isn't the case. This collection features far too many werewolves, ""Sons of Hercules"" and gorillas, and far too few laser beams, goofy aliens, and flying saucers.I would also complain that I was under the impression that it would be mostly B-movies from the 50s and 60s. You know, just what you'd expect from a title like ""Sci-Fi Classics"". (That's probably my fault for buying what I wanted it to be rather than researching it more carefully. Nice work Mill Creek!) Sadly, this collection features a large selection of what look like bad ""Movies of the Week"" and failed TV pilots from the 70s and 80s.There are definitely some quirky gems here, but as I go through the disks I find myself ""passing"" more than ""playing""."
3,100 ?Sci-Fi? Classics,"Bought this as a gift for hubby, he watched most of the movies almost without stopping ... BUT, most of them are more mystery than sci-fi, in that it's a complete MYSTERY as to how a lot of them could be classified SCI-FI!?! FUN though, some are of the variety where they are ""so bad that they're good!"", a lot of fun, and loads of familiar faces over the years."
2,Stock full of Sci-Fi movies but very few good ones,"Stock full of horror movies but very few good Sci-Fi ones. I was looking for old 1950 movies on Space Adventure. Although B-rated in most cases, I remember seeing some fairly good ones from time to time, over the years. I was hoping that this set would at least contain a couple of good movies, but to me, it appears to be mostly horror."
4,A bunch of half good half bad old movies that are fun to watch,These movies were fun to watch. Some are good and some are bad lol. But for the price it's definitely worth it.
1,For Older students,"If your looking for a workbook for students just starting cursive handwriting, this isn't it. It does come with heavy weight tearout flash cards but it has no tracing to start out early learners. It jumps right into practicing letters by yourself and coping poetry."
4,Good for 1st Quarter 3rd Graders,My daughter and I have begun using this book to teach her cursive writing. We were introduced to this style this summer and it has been very effective. Good book.
2,Bare Bones,"This debut album from Vancouver, Canada's Matthew Good Band has a very eccentric flavour. Not at all a rock band, more of a plugged-in folk band. Mr. Good should conside becoming a sad song swooner instead of an angry jaded rocker.The lyrical content combined with the emotional impact of the moody songs makes this collection a good back drop for stuffing your lonely face full of chocolate.She's Got A New Diguise and Fearless are heart wreching love ballads. Where as the blue Haven't Sleep in Years shows the deepest wounds this would be poet is trying to share. A very personal portrait. Not the best over all CD made, but it shows the potential that this unit has if they could only kick up the volume about a thousand times."
3,fav. band not fav. album,"I love the matthew good band, but this isn't quite them, i love symbolistic white walls and fearless, and alabama hotel room is pretty good but I'm not really enjoying the rest, it's a little dry."
2,What [junk].,"This is my favourite band in the whole world, so when I bought their debut album I thought it was going to be good. But it is terrible. Matthew Good hates this album, and with good reason. It is awful. The songs are mediocre; they put the album together fast, put very little money into it and it shows. Compared to their best album, ""Beautiful Midnight"", ""LotGA"" is awful. I give this album two stars, simply because it has one redeeming quality, ""Omissions of the Omen."" It is an excellent song, even though it isn`t mentioned in the track listing. It`s a hidden track that that comes after ""The War Is Over"" and it`s definitely worth waiting for."
4,First Of The Great Albums!,"mgb delivers a greatalbum in this one here. It has all the elements of what mgb is all about but they're differant too. Best songs are ""She's got a New Disguise"" ""Every Name Is My Name"" and the secret song ""Omissions of the Omin"". Although it's not they're best. mgb has a very good starts with they're debut album."
