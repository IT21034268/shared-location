2,poor quality amp kit,When i used this kit i had many problems. first of all the power wire was not long enough for my four door sedan. i had trouble getting the wire from my battery to my trunk. Also the RCA cable was not working which i was not aware of until i had spent days trying to figure out was wrong. i almost replaced the amp.-i would not recommend this kit since it is pain to use and inadequate for most needs.
2,not a true 8 gauge,"Its pretty cheap, but it would do the job for a low watt system.. I just used the RCA cables, and some fittings."
3,Ugh,"Bought this to acompany my dual bandpass 8"". All the cables were fine until I installed the last one which was the RCA cable. One point of the cables metal came off thus making it useless and the other point just simply didn't want to work again. Badd"
3,Good kit for the price.,This is a good complete kit for the price. After some trouble shooting I replaced the fuse since it was not soldered correctly and would loose its connection.
2,A little below average,"The cabling is strictly average for the power and ground, nothing exciting. They are NOT 8 gauge however, they closer to 10. I have plenty examples of 8 gauge wires and this isn't it.The rca cable that comes with the kit isn't bad. The remote turn on is a little thin with the copper for my taste. The speaker wire is AWFUL. It may have the jacket of a 16 gauge speaker wire, but it has the copper of a 20 gauge. It is WAY to thin on the copper. I had a spool of RCA 14 gauge I ended up using instead.The MO for this kit is use thick jackets to make it LOOK like the right size, then use less copper. I guess the extra jacket helps with shielding if nothing else."
4,Awesome kit for real cheap,"This is a real good installation kit. It provided me with enough supplies for the whole install and then some. Only complaint is that this is actually 10 gauge wire....But mine is pushing an 800 watt amp with no problems all day. Don't pass this deal up if your under 1000 watts just for the wire size. If your over 1000, I would look into 4 gauge."
1,cant give negative stars,this is some terrible wire. Thin and brittle and even twice as much plastic as good wire. this is the one to NOT buy
1,Not real 8 awg!,"This is not a true 8 awg wire its more like 12 gauge my Rockford Fosgate RFK10 kit is a 10 awg and there wire is much larger than the supposedly ""8 gauge"" wire in this kit. I have some scrap monster 8 gauge that is thicker without insulation than this wire with insulation. its a real bummer too because now i have to go buy a new kit locally. Other than the mislabeled power and ground wire the kit is pretty nice. the fuse holder, rca/interconnect, and remote wire look nice. the speaker wire is rather small however i did not buy the kit for the speaker wire.I will post a picture of what 10 gauge and 8 gauge looks like compared to this kit."
4,Good!,"very impressed with the shipping, it was a day faster then the first estimated date. The product wasnt quite what i expected, its more like 10 gage for a couple wires, but it is fine for what i need it for, not recomended for high amounts of power though."
1,At least the RCA cable isn't too bad,"The rest of cabling however is extremely sub par. The speaker wire might be 22 gauge at best, and the power wiring is 10 or 12 gauge nowhere near 8 gauge. This kit more or less convinced me not to deal with boss ever again as their products are extremely sub par.I used the RCA cable, but chucked the rest of it in the trash as the rest is complete garbage."
2,It's wiring,"This kit has much more needed to get a higher rating. The speaker wiring is really small and a single color so there is no way to tell which is the positive or negative wire, the fuse that came with it did not blow, but fell apart on the inside and wasn't working after two hours of use. It is a basic wiring kit and only OK for the price."
4,Kit was perfect for the price!!,"The speaker wire cord is about the only thing I tossed out of the kit. Everything else was decent considering the price. I purchased the kit knowing full well I wasn't going to get true gauge. I needed something around 10 so I picked up the 8 knowing it was going to be around 10ish. The speaker wire however was trash, I wouldn't use it on a kit for a sub, maybe for speakers on the doors or something else, but not for the sub. for the price of under 15 bucks 20 feet of ""8"" gauge for the amp, 3 feet of ""8"" gauge ground, 20 feet of rca, and a fuse housing kit. I used my own butt, end, and m/f connectors. The only thing I'd have to find now is some thicker gauge speaker wires."
3,GOOD WIRES BAD FUSE AND HOLDER,I PURCHASED THIS WIRING KIT TO INSTALL MY AMP AND SUB IN MY CAR: wiring was straight forward quick and easy: the only issue ive had with this kit was the fuse and the inline fuse holder: the holder is either loose or the fuse is just crap but for the wires and what the kit is worth it
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed with this kit a little. Everything looked like decent quality when I opened the package but it was a different story with the install. Why would they sell a kit that is supposed to have everything but it is not all compatible with each other? What I found was the power and ground cable is not 8awg. Maybe with the thick jacket it is but the copper is not. If you use a proper crimper like I did, the cable will just pull right out. It is 10awg for the power and ground and the remote turn on is maybe 20awg. The kit comes with lugs that should work with the cable but they are way to big. I work with DC power for a living so I was fortunate to have the correct size lugs.The price is good but if you buy this kit you will need #10 yellow lugs for the power and ground and red for the remote turn on wire. The accessory bag is about worthless, I guess I did use a rubber grommet and a few zip ties out of it."
2,Missing part,"It was missing the cable for remote control to turn the amp on/off as the head unit is on/off. Manufacture need to intensify their quality control or they will lose business. Depending on what you use this to connect to, the thickness is good enough for most use, unless those people who are into that kinds of stuff, which they should already know better to order a set the easy way, instead of go build your own set the hard way. Want quality, then be ready to pay the matching price including more hard work. It's target consumers are those of us who just wanted something to work with what we got at the cost we are comfortable paying, nothing fancy. I am not happy with this product because of the missing part, but, the truth is the truth and the truth is more important than any single one of us, including this unhappy customer."
3,it will work,"Not much to make this kit stand out.Has most connection parts you will need.Fuse holder feels good and solid.Wire loom: although only good for one (1) of the power wires, will not enclose both, so different option is needed for amp connection.If you need the speaker and interconnect, they are here for you.Interconnect states OFC, so bonus.I am only connecting a 150 W amp running 2 8"" speakers, so it's fine for my needsCons:- Power cables are thinner than my 10g speaker cables, but thicker than some 12g I had hanging around.- Interconnect seems to be made of thin gauge wire.- Speaker cable is printed at 16g, but looks more like 20g.It's cheaper than alternatives or buying loose parts, and will work for my use. When I add the second amp, parts will get replaced."
2,"Adequate, but only barely","Bought this kit for install into a Neon. 300/2 JL amp, 8w7sub. It did not seem to provide enough power. Wire seemed small for 8ga, though I didn't measure it. The RCA cables broke when installing. They are of the lowest quality. What started as a good deal ended up being getting what you paid for. I ended up using a high quality (they cost more than this kit) set of RCA cable to complete this install, effectively doubling my cost. bummer."
4,Not Bad,"I ordered these wires along with a capacitor and am satisfied. There was a little less copper inside the jacket than I had hoped, but for the price I can not complain one bit. I used this wire kit on an 800 watt amp pushing two tens and I think everything sounds and is working fine. I would order this kit again, though at some point I may upgrade the power wire to a 2 or 4 gauge wire, just for kicks and giggles."
2,Boss,Was not what I expected. The cable was too short and Not really large enough to work with the Precision Power 580 Si 4 channel Amp.
3,slow shipping and now what is said to be,i bought on monday and still didnt ship till the next monday it took way to long to ship and i am very dissipointed and is totally not 8 gauge i would just go to wallmart and but the cables its a lot easer
2,Shipping,This took way to long to get to me. I could have bought these wires at walmart for cheaper and could have gotten them faster. I am not pleased with order.
4,Cost Effective,Good for lower wattage systems. Comes with 50 Amp fuse but I wouldn't power more than 40 Amps with it.
3,"Nice power wires, not so much for the rest","Pros: The tubing and power wire are good quality and when combined with the cheap price of the whole kit, makes for a good purchase.Cons: However, the speaker wire is so thin i wouldn't trust running my ipod speaker wires with it. The RCA cables made a lot of noise and i ended up just using high quality speaker wire instead.Overall: Buy it for the good quality power wires and hook ups, toss out the speaker wire and the RCA cables!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this kit primary because it promised 8 gauge wiring. When I received the package I was very disappointed that the so called 8 gauge wire is really more of a 12 gauge and certainly not something I would trust to carry 40 to 50 amps of current. The amplifier turn on lead wire is paper thin, again nothing I would trust using and the included speaker wire is also of questionable quality. About the only thing I liked about this kit is the fuse holder which plan on keeping when I upgrade the power cable to a true 8 gauge or even a 6 gauge wire. If you have a small system with one or two amps under 300 watts TOTAL RMS then this kit may be adequate for you. If your amplifiers are capable of more wattage then look else were as you'll be very disappointed."
2,You'll need more then you think,Purchased this kit to go withmy boss amp. As others said the power cable is definitely not 8 gauge. I didn't think this would be a issue as I only needed 10 gauge for my amp. Turns out this is a issue because all the connectors that come with the kit are meant for a 8 gauge cable. Because the cable is thinner then 8 gauge the large rings will not crimp properly and even worst neither will the fuse holder. I had to go out and get a large ring for connection to a 10gauge wire and purchase a fuse holder also for the smaller gAuge. In other words what I initially saved buying this kit vs A more expensive one I ended up spending anyway to make this one work. I strongly advise to Spend the extra money to get a better kit initially. With the proper connectors the cables do work so for that I give it two stars.
2,False advertisement!,"This kit has al the WRONG sized cable guages. The rca cables dont stay in my amplifier, the speaker wire is not even recommended for door panel speakers, and the ground wire and power cables are missleading. Deffinately NOT a 8 guage kit at all. the only positives I have for this product is that the cables had plenty of reach and the shipping was fast. Do not buy this if you want 8 guage wire."
3,Not the Gauges Listed,"I needed a kit so I went with this one. The ""8 Gauge"" red power cable is 8 gauge if you count the outer insulation. It's more like a 10-12 gauge wire. The description also says that the kit included a 16ft long 8 gauge black ground wire, well it's more like a 12 guage, again with very thick insulation, and it was ONLY 2 FEET LONG NOT 16ft as the description says. It's Boss audio. I guess you can't hope to get lucky and possibly even expect them to put a near quality kit together. Don't get me wrong, it works for what's needed. But my amp if only a 400-watt Alpine. Any higher and you would probably starve your amp."
3,Description needs to be changed.,"Jackets are VERY think and seems to be used to disguise the fact that the wires are not in fact the gauges advertised. The fuse that was received was of very poor quality and fell apart upon very light force to remove the fuse holder from the battery in my car. Although, Amazon was excellent in customer service in that they gave me a partial refund so that I may purchase a new fuse."
5,satisfied...,"exellent, got it just in time gonna set ma thing up rite now great product great timing... ordered other stuff and i know they'll be here by tomorrow... awesome online stoor"
2,Cheap (for a reason),"The cable is more 12 or 16 gauge, not quite 8. I would not buy this again. Spend a few more $$ for peace of mind!"
4,Eactly A s described!,The Amp kit was exactly what I Expected it to be for the price. I wasn't adding a lot of equipment so this kit did the job. I installed it on Nov. 2009 and so far no problems at all to report. If your looking for basics this is it.
3,Average,This kit works but I agree with other reviewers that the actual wire sizes are questionable.
1,not actual 8 gauge wire,"Either I got a bad kit or the gauge was sized by the wire and insulation together because all my other 8 gauge cable I had was much bigger. The RCA cables are fine, the signal wire was very small gauge, didnt end up using the speaker wires. The connectors or terminals were junk as well. Got what I paid for this time."
2,Not very good,"the overall quality of this kit is pretty low. it will get the job done but the power cable, ground cable, and speaker wire are almost as cheap as they come. the terminals supplied with the kit are poorly sized for most of the functions they're meant for, much like the gromets and seals. the rca cable offers little more shielding than one you would use on a dvd player. on a positive note, the zip ties and wire cover were very handy for making my above carpet wiring less noticable."
1,Terrible!,These are running a 400 watt amp and my subs are cracking like crazy whenever they are turned on. I hooked my amp and subs up to a friend's truck and they sounded fine. Also have a fully charged battery in my car. These are junk.
1,Not so good,i got this cuz it looked good lol but i was wrong first it's not a 8ga wire more like 10ga the ground wire is very short and the wire itself is very frittle what i mean by that is you twist the wire itself it begins to fall apart it sucks i wouldn't buy this again SORRY JUST GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT IT SUCKSSSSS
4,kit completo de boss audio,Este producto trae posee un kit de cable perfecto para intalar sonidos con un rendimiento excelente y seguro.
1,Poor Quality and Sad,"These wires aren't even 8 gauge wide. They are so cheap because they are so poorly made. If you plan on getting these for subwoofers, don't. Go to your local stereo shop and look though the wire kits that they have."
4,Util y Preciso,"Kit muy util y preciso para la instalacion del Subwoofer.Practico y facil de usar e instalar, completo y buen precio."
4,"OK Quality, Good Value","I will agree with many of the previous reviews. The wire is not actually 8 AWG. I really only needed 10 AWG so it worked out fine. Overall the kit is pretty decent for it's low cost. It is pretty complete and has most of the connectors you would need for a standard install. The only problem I had with this kit was the included fuse. It failed after about 5 minutes of use. The element didn't blow, just disconneted from the endcap. I put in a better quality fuse and haven't had a problem since.4 Stars because I had to find a new fuse right away."
5,cheap and good amp kit,I bought it for my civic 93 hatch with the BOSS AR1500M amp working with sony xplod GTR100L and work good.....good deal
5,Complete kit,"A very complete,quality kit. It made my installation a breeze and saved me time running down unforeseen parts. Worked perfectly with the sub amp installation i intended it for."
2,decent wires,"just so u guys know these wires are very thin, i baught this package just cause i need some new aux cords so the rest of package is sitting in my trunk, i dont think id use these anyways since ive got over 1000 rms so i need thicker cords, just u have an idea i did place a regular #2 pencil up to the power cord and the ground cord, and the pencil was the same size as a cord, so if u got a simple walmart setup this should work for u but not if u have anything decent"
2,You get what you pay for.,Very cheap wiring kit. Speaker wire included is tiny. I only ended up using the RCA's & the fuse from this kit. Spend a little more & get good wiring.
3,It works,"It works but the guage is defiantly wrong, more like 12g with extra thick plastic sleeves, the cooper wires will literally fall apart as you touch them. But for the price you get more wire than you'll know what to do with. And also just a note my fuse holder was defected the day i got this kit, it just recently decided to not work so i am forces to straight wire my amp to my battery"
3,Good starter set,The wire quality is fair but the amount is good. Have enough to wire an amp in the trunk. I don't want to see my wires but these do look good. If you want to look like you spent some money to the kids in your class buy this.
4,The necessary!,it worked for me perfecly to install 1 amp n 4 speakers! not having any connection problem till moment so i recommend this product!
3,Got the job done..,"As the other reviews state, nothing of extra-ordinary quality in this package. However, with my needs being very small and my system weak, these cables were enough to get everything wired and working."
5,TODO VENIA COMPLETO Y DE MUY BUENA CALIDAD,DE LO MEJOR ME GUSTO MUCHO Y DE MUY BUENA CALIDAD TODO SALIO BIEN GRACIAS POR EL ENVIÓ Y POR EL PRODUCTO DE TAN GARN CALIDAD
3,Nice kit but not really 8 gauge,"Nice kit for install, everything you need.As others have said, the wire gauge is not really 8.I knew this when I bought it with other comments and really would have been goog with 10 or 12 gauge, so it's in the ball park."
2,More bad than good,"I bought this not expecting it to be amazing. I did however, expect it to work.I must say even though the wiring is more like 10 gauge rather than 8, the power and ground wire as well as fuse work very well. I have had no issues with those two wires.However the remote and speaker wires are junk. The remote wire is so small that it just stopped working within a month or less. I removed it and replaced it with 16ga copper wire I bought at walmart. The speaker wire finally went out on me another month after that and I have recently replaced it with GOOD 12 gauge copper speaker wire. The quality of sound is much better as well.The RCA cable works fine and seems to be good quality.So recap: good quality power and ground wire, horrible remote and speaker wire. RCA is fine.I would give it 4 stars if I didn't have problems with the other wiring. I at least expect it to work."
3,It's ok,The speaker wire could be better and the ground wire is really short but over all this is a great product and you cant beat the price.
1,"Horrible, dont waste your time or money",This kit claims to be a 8 gauge kit. The wiring inside isnt even ten gauge.Its unsafe to run anything with actual power.dont make the mistake i did by just purchasing it because it came recommended with the amp purchase.
3,Its just ok,"Not sure if its not 8AWG like others say, but it works for small amps, was too small for my simple CPT-2000Wire got too hot"
3,Still Waiting to Install It,Amazon wanted me to rate this product but I have not had the time to use it in the installation of the Boss subwoofer. The star rating is only because the computer system requires one. Hope to install the subwoofer with the wiring harness over the July 4th weekend.
2,Not 8 gauge wire,1st of all definatly not 8 gauge wire! More like 10 if you love music like I do this is definatly not gunna cut it I had to get 4 guage power wire and I used the tiny ground wire they gave me which barely pushes my subs this zip ties are to thin and small the best part of this kit is probably the input cables that's about it. If I culd go bak I'd spend the extra 20 bucks for a better kit it would be worth it less hassle and headaches
1,Expect Boss quality - total lack thereof.,"My friend ordered this kit when I helped him with an amp install. I am a KnuKonceptz guy and was worried when he told me he had bought a Boss kit. My worries were later validated.When I got my hands on the wire I was horrified at how little conductor there is. Radioshack's 10 gauge is thicker than this. The speaker wire is very meh and also very little conductor. The fuseholder is decent, that's the only way it could ever deserve a star. STAY AWAY fro this kit if you want an 8 gauge kit. [...] and their ebay store has quality wire and install stuff for reasonable prices. I've seen so much evidence of Boss's bad quality I don't think I would ever even consider touching a product of theirs. Hope this helps."
1,LOW QUALITY HATE IT PIECE OF TRASH,VERY LOW QUALITY I PAID $15.99 BUT THEY ARE REALLY NOT WORTHED EVEN FOR $1 HATE IT..................... I THREW THEM IN TRASH AFTER WHEN I GOT IT......
2,"Wires arent 8 gauge, more like 12 gauge, and terrible...","The RCA wires broke inside the inputs, the power wire is about a 12 gauge, nowhere close to 8 gauge, and the ground cable is only about a foot and a half,, wayyy to short for my job... highly dissapointed.."
5,Amp Installation Kit,Just what the sound doctor ordered!Impressive collection of parts with instructions for us dummies!Best looking fuse holder ever!
5,Complete Kit!,"Excellent and complete set of cables!. Everything in this kit, was all I needed . Very good cables and nice explanation about installation. Recommended!, greetings from Venezuela!"
1,Absolute Garbage,"DO NOT BUYI can tear the 8 gauge power wire apart with my bare hands.That shows you the quality of wires that are in this kit.The 16 gauge speaker wire breaks off from the amp without any force.You don't even want to try splicing and resoldering the RCA wires.The only thing that seemed ok was the fuse,and I'm sure that the wires will light on fire way before it breaks.I'm replacing this garbage as soon as I break my amp in.Take my adice and don't buy copper wire manufactured in China."
3,It gets the job done,"For the price Id say its worth it,The only issue I had with it was the fact that the Grounding Cable is very small and I needed to get a longer one. Other than that it's great, I'd still recommend spending the extra on a 4gauge kit."
4,All it needs to be,"It's fine for the value. The speaker wire and remote line are cheap, and stripping them requires delicate attention, but the kit works as it should. Nice power wire, fuse, and ground wire. Great extras (loom tubing, tie downs). Kit has worked for me for about a year on my 350W."
3,Not what it claims to be!,"There is no way I could give this PRODUCT a good review. Yes, it is very cheap, but that is because you get what you pay for. I read the reviews for this before I ordered it and figured it was cheap enough to just buy and make-do with this product...I was wrong! Very cheaply made and definitely not 8 ga. wire. However, I am rating this with a 3-stars because I am very happy with this seller. They have very quick delivery and are very easy to deal with."
2,Not really 8 gauge!,"I bought this wiring kit as it was recommended by amazon with my subwoofers. Its been about 2 weeks now, and the power cable that is supposedly 8 gauge has shorted out. I brought part of the wire into a shop and they told me that the wire wasn't even truly 8 gauge. They said that it was branded as 8 gauge because the plastic shielding was included into the gauge! If you are serious about setting up your system, don't buy your power wire from here! Buy gauges that are rated in AWG only! The only reason I gave it a 2 was because the remote wire and fuse work fine."
2,Sometimes you get what you pay for,"As other reviews stated wiring is far below 8 gauge size, connectors are sub quality, ground wire is closer to 14 gauge.all in all a garbage kit, better off getting a kit from Walmart. The rca cables were decent and plenty long enough for installation in an 06 mega cab dodge."
2,You get what you pay for! Not good!,"I bought this kit thinking I may as well for the price, but ended up using only the RCA's in the kit (and I may have to get new ones as I'm getting a buzzing noise).NONE of the wires in the kit are as large gauge as they say they are. The speaker wire especially is trash (it looked like a single strand of metal encased in a centimeter of insulation). The power and ground wires may be enough for you amp but I definitely wouldn't recommend them.The spades and ring terminals provided are not gold plated or even copper, so they don't conduct well at all.Best part of the kit was the fuse and holder, but I didn't end up using them from this kit."
5,Great for small amps,"This is a great amp for the price, but I would not run a large system off of it. I think 1 amp, around a 1000W or less is about it."
1,fell apart after a month and half,my fuse fell apart pretty quickly. the guy who installed it warned me this kit was cheap before he put it in and i guess i should have listened cuz now i have to replace it already
4,Great Buy!,I recommend this for anyone starting out new to wiring there car. it has more then enough length so you wont have to worry. the directions are simple and when done right it sounds great! buy this kit!
2,boss kit 2,Wire is 10 gauge at best fuseholder is the only good item this kit is only good for 250 watts.
1,Get what you pay for,"The cables at first glance appear to be a good quality, however, after a closer look, the metal parts of the RCA plugs are only a sleeve over a nylon pin. this sleeve brakes off really easy and leaves the cable without a metal pin. And worse, the sleeve ends up inside what ever you plugged the cable into.Very cheap and shabby. I would not recommend this product to my enemies."
1,just horrible,this is horrible not the right gauge but thats not the only problem all of the wires are garage and break off
1,Boss wiring kit,The wiring in this kit is not #8 it is #12 with thicker insulation. It is completely fraudulent unless #12 is good enough.
1,Don't recommend,These are not 8 guage wires. Best Buy wouldn't even install my system because of this kit. Spend a few extra bucks and get something better.
2,Not Quite 8 Gauge,"As a previous reviewer said, the power wire is NOT 8 gauge. If you want to run more than a 100 wRMS amplifier using this wire, it would be unsafe.The material used is copper-clad aluminum, which is less expensive, and less conductive than traditional copper. The catch is that you need almost twice the wire to make up for the conductivity difference.The actual wire diameter is roughly equivalent to normal 10 gauge, but since it does not use solid copper, so it should be rated at 12 gauge.Other components in the kit are of similar quality, just enough to function. RCAs are foil wrapped twisted pair, comparable to most low-end RCAs, but no complaints there. Turn-on lead and speaker wire are also undersized, but are less critical... since your amplifier won't be running more than 100 wRMS.If I had to do it over again, I'd buy Audiopipe or KnuKonceptz."
3,ok,I received my items in a timely fashion. Didn't like that I was missing a couple item from the kit I ordered. The smaller components of the kit. Have all the wires but do not have wire connections for terminal and such.
3,"Not great, but okay","The package contains everything you need to wire an amp up to your car stereo. This kit would have been awesome for the price if the wire was actually 8 gauge wire. The power wire was about the same size of a regular 8 gauge wire, except the shielding was about twice as big. This means that the actual copper wire that carries the current was much smaller than an 8 gauge wire. I still would have bought it if I had known that the wire was smaller because it handles my amp just fine, but it is a shame that false advertising is essentially used."
4,Great kit includes everything you need.,the item was exactly what i was wxpecting and for the price the item was perfect and it was recieved quick and in great condition. only problem wasw when i was installing the fuse i found out the fuse was broken on one end. but for the price i cant complain
3,Not for large amplifiers,"The kit is complete, which helps for any install. Be aware that the conductor cross-section is smaller than the cable outer diameter may suggest, and therefore this kit is only usable for smaller amps. Tie-wraps are extremely flimsy (I have never seen such thin tie-wraps), but otherwise parts in the kit are for the most part OK, especially considering the price."
2,"If you need 8 gauge, look elsewhere.","The other reviews that state that this is not 8 gauge are correct. It is actually 12 gauge! The quality seams acceptable, but stating that a wire is 8 gauge when it's really 12 gauge, is not. If all you need is 12 gauge, consider buying this kit. If you need 8 gauge, look elsewhere."
3,Cheap= Low Quality,"The kit comes with everything you need and does the job, but it's not an actual 8 gauge wiring kit. The rubber takes up most of the space shared by the wire and rubber. An 8 gauge kit has more wire inside. To me it looks more like a 10 gauge kit rather than the 8 gauge it says it is. If you're just trying to hook up a basic system and you know what your doing buy the kit, but if you want an actual GOOD kit, look elsewhere."
1,you get what you pay for!,claims its an 8 gauge but its more like a 16 gauge. 16 gauge is more like a 22 gauge. good as a starter kit. you get what you pay for. the outer coating is the gauge type thickness but the wires are half the size they are supposed to be.
1,Think twice,This is definately what you pay for. Its not even CLOSE to 8GA. I went and spent 50 bucks on a real 8GA wiring kit and just putting the wires next to eachother showed the difference. Please reconsider before buying this product. What a dissapointment.
4,Whats the problem?,"I read all kinds of the reviews on here about this kit. This kit for 12 bucks is a good deal. Yes the wire gauge is blown out of proportin a bit. the shielding is quite thick, and the wire inside is smaller than 8 gauge. But if u are looking at this kit, u are looking for a deal. If u are some expert car audio tech, u wudnt even be looking at this kit. if u are puttin in a small to mid size amp, this kit does the job. With that said, even I didnt use the speaker wire in the kit tho, it is way to small for a sub. wud be good for 6x9's. so in short, its a good deal that gets the job done.UPDATE:: it has been a few months now, and everything is still working great. again, u can go pay 70 dollars for the same thing elsewhere, but this kit does the job. if u need bigger wire, get the 4 gauge and use it instead of the 8."
3,Boss Amp Install Kit 2,"This amp kit is alright if you're wiring a small amp less than 500 watts and not wiring up a slammin system. It's good for maybe one sub or a couple of them, just not insane powered. I got this kit in the mail the other day and when I opened it, it looked great... When I went to install it into my car I had a few issues. First of all, the terminal rings are really cheap as well as the wire loom, and some of the wiring. The power wire is nowhere even close to 8 gauge, it has more insullation on the wire than there is copper, it actually seems more like a 10 gauge. The copper is really cheap used in this kit, it's so brittle it comes apart when touching it. Besides all that, the RCA's seem to be of decent quality, as well as the fuse holder. The speaker wire is a little small too, but for 12 bucks this kit does the job at the right price. Good luck"
3,Fuse holder melted,First of all the power wire is like 16 gauge wire its all insulation. now after a few weeks of use i notice that the fuse holder has melted due to cheap plastic used. every thing in this kit is the bare minimum for any amplifier install so dont expect any quality from this kit. Also the speaker wire included is so small it's not even usable again its all insulation with about 20 or so hair sized strands of copper
3,Boss KIT-2 Complete 8 Gauge Amplifier Installation Kit,For the price this kit is alright. Its most definitly not 8 gauge power wire tho more like 10 or higher. No complaints about the fuse so far. Everything else included in this kit is crap.
2,8 awg my a**,Power and ground are decent remote is decent RCAs are a little below decent speaker wire is horrid it literally turned to dust after i scraped away the jacket wires arent pure copper they are copper clad aluminum and are more like 10 ga then 8. Overall I wouldn't buy it again and would only recomend it if you plan on replacing it.
1,JUNK,This wiring kit is junk. Way to thin the rca cable ends break and the wires pull apart and rip because there so cheap. Wouldn't buy this again and wouldn't. Waste my time with a wiring kit from amazon again either...they are all like this.
3,YOU DEF GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~,Its not a bad kit for the price but what do you expect for less then 15 dollars? 3 stars worthy... Just wish they would have better pictures of what your actually getting.
1,Worst wire ever,This product is complete junk. Not true 8 gauge wire. I'm done with this crap. When I got this kit 2 days later me and my uncle was switching out amps and the effin RCA jack broke off in the amp but good thing it was the Chanel that was no good this product is complete junk and my fuse blew within a month and went and got a old one and worked just fine I wouldn't recommend this product for anything you'd be better off getting nothing with this effin wiring kit my surround sound wire was thicker than this crap and it was 22 gauge and it was thicker than this piece of garbage I mean this product sucks balls!!!! People read these reviews before purchasing such a product like this piece of ****
4,Good Enough for Who It's For...,"I used this in my truck for a small amp to power a small subwoofer to give a little depth of sound to the tinny stock speakers... the amp is having some issues, I don't know if it's due to these wires, the head unit, or the amp itself (maybe it simply can't handle 2 ohms). The kit came with a good length of wires and a weather resistant fuse, this kit was slightly more than the cost of a decent fuse holder, so I got it."
5,great kit for the price,"This kit is powering my 1200 watt amp and sub just fine.It had everything I needed,and couldn't argue with the price."
3,you get what you pay for,"I'm not a stereo geek, so had Sony 12"" subs(1200w) and amp(1100w/600 rmp) professionaly installed. I was told the some of the wires were not true 8 gauge wire and not strong enough to handle the watts that states. Basically, I had get a better amp kit. The only thing that was used was the speaker wire. I give it a three because of price and it is meant for smaller amps(under 1000).."
4,Get what you pay for,"I was kinda of upset. The RCA cables it comes with are junk. Good thing you cant mess up remote wire, ground and power. So which just happened to be what I needed, so I cant complain to much."
2,It does the job,"This kit does the job but, I wish I used heavy ganged wire. If you are running a lot of watts, this system shuts down my system too much and was needed to be replaced with a better kit. Don't waist your money, buy the better kit the first time you will be glade you did later."
1,NOT 8 Gauge WIRE,I should have know that you cannot get a decent kit for under $20 to wire your amp. The actual wire inside was closer to a 12 gauge than an 8 gauge wire. The jacket was 2/3 of the wire's total thickness. Spend your money elsewhere.
5,Great kit everything needed to install my amp,"Great kit, it included everything I needed to install my amp. The loom that it came with gave it a nice clean look. The speaker wire could have been a little thicker though. Overall worth the $ I paid for it. Got the job done."
2,cheap wiring kit,"This kit will do the job for a good price point but that is not without its flaws. The speaker input wires are not marked positive or negative making connections more time consuming then they should be especially if you running a longer wire for your amp to your speakers, there should at least be a stripe indicating positive to avoid wrong connections."
2,8 Gauge in their dreams...,"As this is an inexpensive kit, it might be worth it to get the few useful items, like the large fuse and holder. But if you're expecting 8 gauge wires, it would only be wishful thinking. Unless, of course, you coiunt the thick plastic jacketing in the wire.There was enough for wire for a decent installation, and in my case, I thought 12 gauge wire would be adequate, it was adequate.But if you're planning to do a top notch install and actually want the advertised size, you will want to look elsewhere, as this isn't it.Not totally satisfied with this purchase."
5,good product,"Everything about this was really good. wires and connections seemed good quality. everything I needed to hook up my new sub and amp in my truck. Main power wire seemed smaller than advertised ""8 gauge"" but was definitely large enough for my application. Happy with this product."
1,this product is a lie.,"when i recieved this i was expecting real wire, what they send is total junk. i got real 4g wire and compared the 2 wires. boss was HALF the size of the real wire. dont buy this wire kit. there are way more options out there."
1,"BOSS wiring kit ""FAIL""","I have used many wiring kits in my car audio past, but hands down BOSS was reasonably priced. The only setback is that the quality of wire and fittings are terrible. I had to go and purcahse STREETWIRES crimp connections because the BOSS connectors supplied were just made of budget quality junk. A big thumbs down to the very skimpy P-Con wire. I decided to purchase a heavier gauge because the outer wire protective coating was very low quality and weak. If you are going to use a capacitor, the power wire is a good length and extra to spare, but the ground wire was very short. Usually I purchase STREETWIRES amp wiring kits because the power wire is already fused 6 inches on the cord battery lead and it's preassembled. The BOSS wiring kit, you have to do it all yourself. I guess I have been spoiled by higher quality amp wiring kits. Next time I will pay the extra for quality and just plain ol' nice looking wires. BOSS is definitely not on my next amp wiring kit list. Sorry!"
2,Not 8 gauge,Just like many of the other reviews it is NOT 8 gauge wire. Go with a better kit to avoid problems.
4,Will get it done.,"Had some serious shortfalls in the quality of the connectors and the lead wire, but the ground, rca and power wires, along with nice fuse holder made up for it. Great price at under $20 and will get the job done. Audiophiles need not purchase, as anything under $100 will likely not suit your needs, for the rest of us this is more than needed."
1,Not really worth it,"I wasn't expecting much but these wires are complete junk. I had read some of the other reviews that said the wires were brittle but thought it was either an exaggeration or a fluke, so I never expected that after I had striped the excessive amount of insulation off that the copper would literally crumble in my hands. I barely got the terminals on, and while the wires work I'm afraid to move them to much. As others have stated the speaker wire is way to thin and the RCA cables are only average. The only good thing in the package was the fuse holder which seemed to be of decent quality."
3,Undersize wire/ CHEAP zipties,"As stated in the title ""undersize wire, CHEAP zipties"". But it has everything there for a low budget, low powered amp install. However it does NOT have provisions for hooking the main hot wire to a side terminal battery. Even so... still for a low power install it's fine."
3,8 GAUGE,"I just received my Boss KIT-2 Complete 8 Gauge Amplifier Installation Kit and have yet to install it, but wanted to point out a very critical detail regarding all these reviews about the wire being small.Printed on the box and the wire itself are the words ""8 GAUGE"". Notice that it does not say 8 AWG (American Wire Gauge). What is 8 gauge? Who knows? But they deliberately left off the ""AWG"" designation, which is a standardized wire size, so they could legally get by with selling wire that is smaller than you would expect.I'm not upset about this though, because I read enough of the reviews to know that the wire was going to be small. I'm hooking this up to a 150 W amplifier that could get by on 10 AWG wire. The rest of the kit seems decent and good enough for what I'm using it for. But to everyone complaining that the wire isn't really 8 AWG, it's because it's not labeled to be that. Very sneaky."
2,"Poor quality, not worth the low price.","The tips on the RCA cable that came with this kit broke during installation. The wire is very thin, doesn't meet the 8 gauge labels. Very fragile overall. Get a better quality kit, you'll thank yourself for it."
2,"Will work, But not good.","This item comes with all the wires you need to hook up an amp and subs but the wires are much smaller than described definantly not 8 gauge wire and cheap speaker wire too, save yourself some time and money and buy a better one from a better known/trusted brand because you will be disappointed with this unless you are hooking up a very small amp."
3,"You can't beat the price, but keep that in mind...","It's a pretty good deal on every thing you need to install an amp. The cable is nice, but it's pretty lightweight - that's really my only negative. For what I needed it worked perfect and the price could not be beat!"
2,Do not buy it if you...,"I bought this kit thinking in the good quality and the price. However, a cousin of mine recommended me to change the gauges #8 for #4, just in case. So I had to replace practically the whole kit. If you are thinking to buy this kit, my recommendation to you is to buy the kit #4. Only in this way you will be sure that whatever the amplifier, capacitor or subwoofer you are going to use will work properly."
1,Total Garage!!!,Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra money for a better wiring kit. The tip of one of the cable broke off in my amp and the wire thinkness is not true... Almost had to purchase another amp.. Very disappointed..
4,"Very happy with product, although I don't believe it is 8 guage, maybe 10?",Very happy with the product and it's contents. It came rather quickly and has everything needed to install a middle of the line amp install stereo system.
1,LOL!,"If I hadn't gotten this simply to get free shipping and hoping for a decent fuse holder I would've blown my stack. The wire is the biggest waste of plastic I have ever seen. The 8 gauge wire is as thick as a decent 10 gauge from the insulation circumfrence, the actual wire is seriously 16 gauge. PATHETIC ruse."
4,Does the Job!,"I will have to agree with previous posts, the actual copper wire itself is more along the lines of 10 gauge. Other than that, the kit seems really good. I'm using it to run a 300 watt amp. So far no problems."
2,boss wiring kit,i was a little suprised when i got tha kit everything was ok except they lie to you its not 8 guage wire its alot smaller and tha rca jacks suck the ground wire was to short to use i had to use my old power wire as a ground tha speaker wire was ok it wil work but for how lond idk tha only rele good thing was tha fuse holder it worked perfect but if your buying a wiring kit dont be cheap shell out an extre few bucks and get somthin good thats wat im about to go do!!!
5,"Plain and simple,get this kit!","For the lack of money you'll spend and the quality of the wiring, do yourself a favor and get this amp kit. You won't be sorry!"
2,get what you pay for,i guess this a descent kit but the inline fuse holder broke somehow and im always messing with these wires to get my stuff to work.
2,Junk,"I think it's safe to say this is just horrible wire. I hooked up everything just fine to my Pioneer headunit in my 02 Celica. Two days later, the power wire just stopped working. There was not damage to the exterior of the wire, just stopped working. I suggest you spend a few extra bucks to get a nicer package."
2,Dont listen to amazon,This was the first time instaling a amp for me. So i orderd this with a 1600 watt pyramid 2 chan. amp. about a mounth later of pulling way more than nessasary power i melted the fuse link and about cault my car on fire. So dont just listen to amazon do some reserch.Even as a noob in car audio I could tell the speeker wire was crap. Its about 90% insulation with like 2 strands of wire down the middle. The hot wire and ground look good but after awile started to oxidise in the fuse link. So then you lose good canection and have to clean your wire. the fuse link is about the only good looking ling in this kit and I managed to melt it too. So just FWI not great for 1600 watts max.
1,worst kit ever.,"save the money and get the DB audio kit, the rca's are filled with plastic and covered in VERY thin metal, i put them in and they broke off inside the amp. the coating around the outside of the wire, is bigger than the wire itself, very cheap, but you are buying boss, so what do you expect? save the money, and get something thats actually worth it."
1,Piece of junk started on fire!,"I had an 80 amp fuse in it and was listing to my music fairly loud when I started to smell burning plastic. I pulled over right away and opened my hood to see the fuse holder melted, and the wires touching and sparking. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"
3,Nope,"If this is 8 gauge then I drive a supercar. I use thicker wire for speaker wires for my fifteen. I bought this kit to hook up a sub in my sisters car. Very dissapointed in the quality of this kit. All things are included, but they are for true 8 gauge wire. But for the price, I should have known it was too good to be true."
2,Fuse Holder is of poor quality.,"I had two self powered subwoofers installed with two sets of this kit. The fuse holders were placed under the hood right next to the power distribution box. Both fuse holders have since melted and disconnected power to my subs. I have only had them installed for a little less than a month and they gave out on me today. Not so pleased. I gave this two stars because the quality when working is great. but the materails that the fuse holder is made of must not be too durable. Also, my car never overheats so I can't see what would cause the extreme heat to melt normal plastic. I mean, my fuse box isn't warped or anything."
3,Fast shipping,For one i ordered this for my friend. The package came and it was damaged badly along with the box the wires were in. Fast shipping. If your new to sound systems and your not going big on speakers yet i would recommend this kit. The highest i would go on speakers with this wire would probably be one 12'' speaker. After that 6-4 gauge depending on how many speakers you have.
3,Cables are good but not the fuse,This KIT is pretty well packed. It has all you need for wiring. HOW EVER THE FUSE BURN IN LESS THAN A MONTH. I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER ONE. Also The ground (Black Cable)was wayyy too short.
2,Disappointed,"Recieved the item slightly before expected which was nice. However I was extremely disapointed with the kit. The ""8 gauge"" wire that came with it was very thin. I ended up using a different wire for my 1000 watt kenwood amp. Honestly an extension cord would be a better choice than this ""8 gauge"" wire. If you want a quality kit, stay away from this one."
1,dont buy this,The kit is not 8 gauge wire and its probably not even 10 gauge...I know it was low price but i didn't think it would be complete junk quality. I would be scared to run this wire to my amp. not impressed!!
2,You get what you pay for,I wasn't expecting a premium kit for the price... but I am honestly a bit worried about using these wires and might end up purchasing a better quality kit and rewiring my setup. Like other reviewers have mentioned the wires may be covered in an 8 gauge insulator but the amount of copper is more like a 10 gauge or smaller even. On top of that the copper is very very brittle. I noticed this and was immediately worried. I went to put a ring terminal on the end of the power wire and couldn't believe how much copper broke off and it wasn't from poor stripping. You can break the internal conducting wire easily just by twisting it up a little. This shouldn't be the case with quality wire. The speaker wire and the amp remote wire are the same way. The fuse and the fuse holder are pretty good and may even be worth the entire price of this kit but the wire is junk. I would feel safer spending the extra cash on some quality wire and not have to worry about it.
3,Good price.,The price is good for the RCA and 8ga cables alone. The rest of the wires are kinda junk. The remote wire is useless but the included speaker wire works well for the remote. Get yourself some good 10-12ga speaker wire and this and you should be all set for a moderate system.
4,boss audio kit-2,the products of the Boss mark are very good and the sound equipment I cannot be complained.
2,Ok for small amp,The Wire in this kit is 10 gauge at best. I had some 8ga. left over from another install and this wire was smaller :( Then it. other then that everthing else was good.
3,does what it says,"I like the length of all the wires except the ground wire. I thought the ground could have been a little longer but thats just me, other than that this is a solid product.They give you a lot of connectors too. It's aaaiiight."
1,more like 16 guage,"The AWG standard for 8 gauge wire is 3mm diameter of SOLID copper, this wire is 3mm in diameter but contains about 100 strands,Stranded wire gauges are calculated by the equivalent cross sectional copper area (much less per unit size than solid wire) So this wire is,at best, 16 gauge, about right for a table lamp, not a car stereo amp. Just for comparison ,a competitor has a 8 gauge kit with wire 8.36 mm in diameter and 735 strands, that would meet AWG standards for 8 gauge."
2,Not good enough!,The wire does not seem thick enough to be 8 gauge. I went with Rockford Fosgate wiring kit. Better quality!
4,Does the job it is made to do.,"If you don't want to shop around for the items to connect your amp or amp/sub combination then go ahead and drop the extra $20. I do have to agree with the other reviewers about the wire size though. The conductor portion of the main wire is somewhere between a #12 and a #10 AWG. However, the supplied fuse is 30 amps which is about right for the wire size. The trigger wire to turn on your amp is smaller than the specs for the amp calls for but since it only has to turn on a relay I doubt it will ever cause any problems. As far as the lengths of the cables are concerned unless your putting your equipment into a stretch limo you will have plenty."
3,8 gauge casing with 12 guage copper,"this kit seems exceptional at first view. plenty of wiring, screws, terminals and whatever else. however, upon inspection you will find that the power and ground wires are poor. the casing is comparable to a normal 8 guage wire but the copper core is 12 gauge at best.i installed the kit in my car regardless of my concerns and so far so good. i've been successfully powering a 700watt amplifier, with the help of a capacitor, and the wires seem to be holding up. no smoking wires or blown fuses yet.i gave this product 3 stars because it is a good kit with lots of stuff and plenty of everything but i have obvious concern for the power wires. i would be hesistant to buy this product again."
3,Not bad but not blazing,"This is mostly one band backing several different singers for the various songs. The singers come from CHELSEA, The VIBRATORS, The ALARM, The BUSINESS, The BOYS, 999, PETER And The TEST TUBE BABIES and the UK SUBS. This must have come out about the late 90's or early 2000's based on pictures of the singers. The songs are functionally adequeate but not sparkling with the exception of the Guns of Brixton which has the instruments and vocals and production all done by RTZ GLOBAL. Holy smokes! that's a great cover. Makes me wanna turn it up and enjoy it as much as any original CLASH song. The rest of 'em aren't horrid, just, well, a bit lacking. Not bad really. It is punk rock, not hardcore. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
3,Good...not great!,"needs a little work. There are a couple good songs on this hard to find album by Grendel. IMO, not worth the price unless you are allready a huge fan of this band. I suggest starting off with 'Harsh Generation'...that's the best album by Grendel. %99 of Grendel fans agree."
3,Hail Social,"I found 'Hail Social' through Pandora and decided to buy their self entitled cd. It's pretty good, the bass and drums are great and the guitar riffs are cool but I can't get past the vocals; a little too high pitched. Apparently this Philadelphia band only made one more album ""Modern Love & Death,"" which I have heard most of and sounds a little more techno-ish, but it's still good alternative rock. Overall they're pretty good but this trio should have turned into a quartet with a grittier singer."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I liked this book because the story was engaging and plus I liked Mrs. Kilpatrick's other book, Near Death. I liked the fact that the plot got right to the point and did not waste time describing things that were not central to the story."
3,fast paced standard fare,"I read this book under recomendation from a freind. The tale is particularly unoriginal, but moves at a fair old lick which makes up for it. The characters are also from the old-skool similar to the italian and cuban style of hardnut gangsta. Being a Londoner i am more empathatic to the story but the style of writing is pretty poor. The other two books also follow in his gangsta antics with the typical shootout at the end! If you want to read a real yardie book then ""The Harder They Come"" is the one for you. END"
4,Sleeper Album..I Must for the Collection,This album has escaped so many people but it really a nice work. Hopefully they come back with something new soon.
4,I like their first CD better,"I really enjoyed their first CD, All the Way, better than this one. I don't regret buying this CD though. My favorite songs are Amazing, Too Close and Wrapped up. In All the Way, all of their songs are my favorite, except for the annoying interludes! lol Buy this album!"
5,Essential for every baby,"I bought this CD set on a whim because the price was so low for a 2 disc set. I LOVE these CDs and so does my daughter. Like another reviewer, I would play a CD as I was nursing my daughter before bed. She is 1 1/2 now and as soon as the music starts she just puts her head right down. We recently traveled and I brought a CD with us. I truly believe having her music made it easier for her to sleep in a strange place. Buy this set for yourself or as a gift. You won't be disappointed."
2,Will crack with some heat.,I primarily used it for monitoring manifold pressure under force induction engines ... it would work for a while but it soon developed heat cracks and require replacement. Avoid using this stuff in the future and go with something more heat tolerant.
3,Could have been better,If you take out all the sound effects and talking/speach crap put in this you would have a top rate album. I don't know why they add all the junk but the songs themselves are very good.
3,vocals?,great music. terrible vocals. generic screaming vocals by a no talent. how can they have this tool singing after having 2 great vocalist like guy and rhett. this guys screaming ruins nearly every song.
1,Refused,"I refused this product because you send me wrongly two times the same ""Privilege of power"" CD at the same date.You have to pay me back now.Philippe Guerra"
1,This a Demo - not a real product,"I only gave this product a 1 because 0 was not an option.This is not a real product. This is a demo. This CD only contains 2 out of 8 English lessons. The rest are part of the ""advanced"" product. (More money please)The learning time module consists of learning ""o'clock"" only. No ""quarter past three"" or ""three thirty"". Just 3 o'clock.For other languages (Portuguese, Chinese etc.) it only contains the first Exercise in the first lesson. Just enough to learn to say boy, girl, cat, dog. I'm not kidding.I don't know how they get away with saying that this has been selected by the State Department. Certainly the State Department didn't select this demo. I find it hard to imagine that they would even select the full product from what I saw..."
4,Very Pleased!,Very sofy and flows nicely. We didn't want our babies nursery to be dark so this beautiful sheer drape set was perfect for us. They let just enough light in for a soft welcoming glow throughout the room. Goes great with the rest of the KoKo line which we also have and love.
3,"Satin Hands works, but it's overpriced","I have used two of the three products that are in Mary Kay's Satin Hands pampering set: the hand lotion and the exfoliating scrub. Both work (though the lotion leaves hands a little greasy), but not noticeably better than many products that are far less expensive. I don't think Satin Hands is worth the money. But it's not a bad product."
4,Pickin' and Grinin',"What a humbling experience! I thought I was getting pretty good on the old banjo until I popped this disc into my CD player. Wow! On some tracks, it sounds as if the recording is sped up because they are picking so damn FAST! No wonder bluegrass tunes are typically short. Any longer and the banjo player's hands will catch fire. Not all of this collection's tracks are strictly bluegrass as some are novelty numbers. Still, even lightweight tunes, such as the ""Tequilla"" and Beatles covers, feature some fine pickin'."
5,Makes incredible bread dough!,"If you are looking for an all-purpose mixer to have for several years, this is the one for you! In my first try it made incredible dough and I can tell already I'm looking for excuses to use it. I purchased a refurbished mixer and it really was as good as new. Even though I tried, I couldn't find a thing wrong with it. The mixer is easy to use and comes with a detailed instruction manual and recipe book. KitchenAid has definitely lived up to its spectacular reputation. My only complaint is that it is heavy (27lbs) so it may be difficult for some to move."
1,DOA,"I ordered one for my mother's b-day, it arrived defective; the motor sounded as though a brush was loose. Be careful w/ the refurbs. Never had a problem w/ Amazon refurbs before, but I'll be cautious hereon out. Fortunately, Mom is both frugal and forgiving, and we're getting her a new one."
5,To KitchenAid or not to KitchenAid:,"A must-have for all serious (and mildly serious) bakers. Not as useful as I thought it would be for other things, but I use it for all my baking needs: from pizza dough & muffins to zuchini bread & pumpkin pie (of course I have the slicer/shredder attachment). The initial price is formidable, but it is endlessly useful."
4,Kitchen Aid Mixer,This product is a really great buy. I shopped around and found that this was the lowest price. The product came just as pictured. The bowl was a little scratched since it is refurbished but overall the condition was extremely good. The mixer works wonderfully and so far I am very happy with it. It is a great product there is none other on the market that could compare to it. It makes baking at home much easier and less time consuming. I would reccomend this to anyone who hassles with an ordinary hand mixer to spend the money on this item because it is totally worth it.
5,Reliable workhorse!,"Great product and the refurbished model is an incredible price. Mine is 22 years old and has never given a moment's trouble, even with *heavy* and frequent use. Excellent value."
1,problems with the transmission,I ordered one of these mixers when they were $125. I received the mixer and it looked great but it had a terrible noise in the transmission in the lower gears and when you went from a high speed to a lower speed the gears would slip. I returned this one and amazon send me a second that had been packaged poorly and was damaged in shipment. The second one also had the same problem with the gears as the first one did.
3,Nice mixer........weighs a ton!,"I purchased this mixer as a gift based on the product reviews. While this is a nice mixer at a good price, be aware that it weighs over 25 lbs! For some people, that is alot of weight to have to move around and may diminish the benefits of the mixer's capabilities."
5,A Good Investment for Your Kitchen,"This mixer is a wonderful addition to any kitchen. It is simple for beginners to use, yet sophisticated enough for any cooking zealot. A cook with a large family who needs to produce massive quantities might do better with the Kitchen Aid 6qt stand mixer, however.I've owned my refurbished KitchenAid mixer for over five years now with no problems. The plastic covers are very nice especially if you leave it on the counter -- no one likes rinsing dust or grease splatters out of their mixing bowl before cooking!I also recommend purchasing a food processor in addition to this mixer; it is tempting to use this for both but impractical, as you cannot easily dice onions while mixing a cake at the same time."
5,10 years of Heavy Duty Daily Use and Still Going!,"My mother has been baking numerous cakes, breads and pies on a DAILY basis for her charity work the past 10 years with this unit. I bought this refurbished unit for her from Amazon in 2002. We're upgrading her to the 6 quart, 600 series this Mother's Day but she hasn't had a single problem with her beloved ""Babe"" the whole time. Hoping she has another 10 years with the new one we've ordered for her."
5,Best purchase I ever made,"I just purchased this mixer for a gift to myself. As I have had permanent nerve damage leaving it difficult for me to use my arms, this mixer is a god send! It looks brand new all the way, no marks, scratches what so ever and it works like a charm! This has been my dream mixer for many years, I wish I could of gotten one sooner but now this is my most cherished applicance! I once again can get back into doing baking chores I love to do! This mixer has all the muscle to do it for me!"
5,"""Get-the -job-done"" mixer",I' d been wanting a Kitchenaid mixer for a while. Love it!! What's not to like....and at Amazon's great price. I'm very pleased.
5,Kitchen Aid Mixer,"We bought this Mixer as a Christmas present for our Daughter. My wife has been using this same model for years. She has given it a real workout. In addition to regular home cooking, my wife has been making most of the wedding cakes for the family and neighbors all those years. We have never had a problem with the mixer nor have had reason to be dissatisfied. An extra mixing bowl is a real plus, I suggest you get one. My daughter has used her mothers mixer on may occasions and has always wanted one. She says her Christmas present works great."
5,A Dream Come True!,"I have wanted one of these for almost 12 yrs but I found the cost to be hard to justify . I won a 25 dollar Gift Certificate to Amazon.com from a recipe program that I use for being the top recipe poster for the month , I took advantage of the additional 25$ discount that Amazon offered and I picked the super saver shipping . I was a little leery because it was reconditioned my fears were just that fears . The machine was perfect , it works like a dream . If you are like me and your sitting there wondering if you should or shouldn't take a chance on this purchase , do it you wont be sorry!"
5,All-Around Favorite!,"This is the cookbook you can count on for authentic, trustworthy recipes. Such a good variety of every ethnic favorite-this is the one cookbook I own that is worn to a frazzle!"
1,Hope you enjoy the cactus with the sombrero,Most of the children and teachers pronounce the colors and shapes correctly but then comes the animated cactus with a sombrero on to mess everything up. As if the stereo type image was not offensive enough he then butchers the pronunciation of every word! My child was so confused. I kept telling him to ignore the cactus! Would not recommend this video to anyone!!
5,FABULOUS BEST WORK IN YEARS! MAYBE EVER,"I have been waiting for this cd to come out since I 1st heard the single, THE BEST OF INTENTIONS. And that song barely scratches the surface. Travis is back folks! My early favorites are A GREAT DAY TO BE ALIVE, SOUTHBOUND TRAIN and especially I WISH I WAS WRONG, as powerful a ballad as I have heard in years. Every song is strong and the production plays into Travis' natural talents perfectly. I HIGHLY recommend this cd!"
1,Down the road and down the tubes,"There are probably a lot of physically repulsive singers who find fame but Tritt wins best of show in any dog contest. Stillhe has an entertaining value when he's working hard. This album is just the sound of an aged artist's creaking bones. On ""Just Too Tired to Fight It"" he sounds like he means every word of the title. Aren't there any nursing homes in Nashville -- preferably one with a front porch -- Tritt could retire to?"
2,The Beauty Milk is Better,"This glycerine has the consistency of K.Y jelly, which wouldn't be so bad, if it actually lightened. I have seen dramatic results using the caviar face cream and mediocre results using the beauty milk, but this did nothing for my skin but sit on it, creating this ""oil slick"" look that I didn't quite fancy. I developed hyper-pigmentation from a bad bout of hives which I unfortunately scratched to the point where I developed superficial scars. The beauty milk alleviated some of the scars, the caviar cream rid me of all my facial hyper-pigmentation, but the glycerine just appeared to be a very expensive moisturiser"
5,Great Learning Tool,"This CD-ROM is great for anyone trying to learn basic phrases in Polish. I am a native Polish speaker and I would recommend this CD-ROM to anyone trying to pick up on basic Polish pharase. As far as learning the whole language, you'll need a little more than a CD-Rom."
4,Larstan's The Black Book on Persona l Finance (Black Book Series),"Thoughtful and forceful. Many good thought pieces by various authors, lots to think about and act upon. Well done."
5,thanks,"i tip my hat to 5Fefrenzy for keeping touch with the weightier matters of music (fun, praise) and christianity (justice, love, mercy) while maintaining a degree of humility. The lack of condescention was very refreshing and may make the album easier for nonchristians to enjoy as well. Their refusal to subscribe to man's labels (e.g. Cool Enough..., Litmus on the 2nd album) is inspiring to the rest of us, as is their recognition that sometimes those to whom we entrust authority abuse that power (Riot Gear on Quality..., Fistful of Sand on Our Newest...); Christianity needs some radical people again--let us not forget the change inspired by John the Baptist, Francis of Assisi, MLK, and Jesus Himself, the most radical Man ever! Thanks FIF. Matt.25:34--end, Isaiah58, Psalm149, Heb6:10."
4,A lot of FUN,I always enjoy listening to this cd.It lifts my spirits and makes me feel joyful. Its great listening and the lyrics hit home.It has a lot of meaning behind the music
4,FIF is for me!,"I love this cd! FIF sounds like ""Reel Big Fish"" and ""Mighty Mighty Bosstones,"" only better. The Old West, Anthem, Shut Up, and Combat Chuck are the best songs.I love the sound of Reese's voice, and the brass is excellent!You must buy this cd!"
4,"A little inconsistent, but a lot of fun to listen to","This album contains a good portion of Five Iron Frenzy's best songs, including their consensus best song, ""A Flowery Song."" There are some tracks I find a bit annoying, boring, or repetitive in the middle of the album, but the beginning and the end make it worthwhile. A lot of the songs won't be the type to be your favorite song, but they're enjoyable to listen to. Not just that, but unlike a lot of ska, Five Iron Frenzy songs often make you want to sing along. The lyrics are actually a bit heavy with political and social commentary, but that's easy enough to ignore if you want to.If you're looking for some poppy ska, buy this album, and you won't regret it, if only because you'll hear ""A Flowery Song."""
4,Five Iron's Funness,"Five Iron Frenzy takes the cake when it comes to being fun. With their simple melodies and upbeat percussion, the music put's you in a good mood. But along with their fun they incorperate their message as well. A Flowery Song takes the Doxology and turns it into a fun ska song (with barnyard animals in the bridge). I guess their main message is you can love Jesus and still have fun."
3,distortion ridden guitar with the hamonic sounds of brass,There is only one song that I have heard from this album and you can check it out on the SELTZER 2 video. I thisnk it's caled flowers or it has ssomething to do with them. The lyrical patterns aretotally catchy. I don't normally like ska but I want this album just because of this one song. The voice of the singer is prettty cool also.
4,Dizzy and Moe Pop A Da,"Dizzy Gillespie lost a few steps by 1988,when this was recorded-on trumpet.But not in scatting;and his scatting on Oop Pop a Da is not to be missed.Moe Koffman-on flute and alto sax- sounds like he's on top of his game at 'George's Spaghetti House' in Toronto."
4,Good Bag,"I really like the bag as it can be used as a bag or a backpack. It is on the bigger side, but holds everything that baby needs. We have not had the need to expand the bag. There are plenty of pockets and places for all the gadgets baby needs. I recommend this bag as we received several others as gifts but we use the Bjorn bag exclusively. Best of all you know when you buy a Bjorn product you're getting a quality item."
1,To Pricey and Bulky,"This is not a good item. I purchased this to find the ultimate diaper bag, for easy use. It is very bulky and believe it or not...doesn't fit all that much. It does have the extension but let me tell you...that doesn't make that big of a deal. It is way to big to use on a dialy basis, and is not that easy to carry (I use the over the shoulder way), and doesn't have enough room for weekend trips. The side compartments are so narrow that it is hard to hold an extra outfit in there if you already have diapers in there. It will fit 10 diapers but after that and an extra outfit and a toy it already is over stuffed, even fully extended. And that is pretty much all we are using it for so far...my son is only 5 months and is breastfed so we haven't even attempted to put in bottles or baby food. For the quality of Baby Bjorn and the price that this is I really expected this to be a much better item. I am a big Baby Bjorn fan but this is really poorly designed."
2,Hardcore?,"After hearing good things about these guys and checking out a few live clips on youtube I decided to purchase this album. I have a few issues with this release.1. The first half of the album is pretty much nu-metal. I understand that they went that direction toward the end, but half the tunes on here have a lame sort of Linkin Park feel. If I want to hear psuedo-metal I'll turn on MTV.2. Where are the lyrics? One would think that a band with a message might include a lyrics sheet with their 'greatest hits' album. I grew up on a steady diet of straight edge hardcore and I was really curious to see how the message evolved.3. Things get better as the album progresses. I wish they put the songs in chronological order instead of the reverse.If you are looking for a good harcore album I would skip this one. Buy one of their older releases instead. The good songs at the end of this release do not make up for the crappy ones that lead off."
4,Johnny's still here!,"There's age in this great voice and some of these songs emphasize the age. But the essence is still here, loud and clear.His opening cut, ""I Won't Back Down"", is the immortal Johnny C., making a powerful statement, followed with another powerful statement, Neil Diamond's ""Solitary Man"". The emotion really gets to one in his rendition of Frankie Laine's ""Lucky Old Sun.""""I See A Darkness"" and ""Mercy Seat"" do rather send chills, and one wonders it these two are not reflections of Cash as an older man. But there's sure some brightness with Johnny & Merle together on ""I'm Leaving Now"".""Wayfaring Stranger"" is a somber windup to this album, but as a whole, this belongs right with his older recordings."
4,Powerful material,"If you want to see a strong man cry, play him this album. From a musician who has constantly refused to give in to conventional musical format comes another powerful piece of work. In light of recent news surrounding Mr. Cash's illness, this music carries quite an emotional wallop. He sings lyrics like ""I won't back down"" and ""I'm not afraid to die"" with conviction and strength that is downright inspiring. This music is not country, it's not pop, it's not folk...it's CASH. He has a way of making every song he covers his own. For those of you who have heard criticism of Cash's current vocal abilities, pay it no mind. His voice is as strong as it's ever been. Buy this one and cherish it."
5,Never Better,"Cash delivers perhaps the most soulful, moving set of his career complete with clean, simple acoustic backup. The rebellious ""I Won't Back Down"" will touch a familiar chord inside most listeners. The tragicomic ""Nobody"" summarizes, in a few concise stanzas, the existential loneliness most of us feel in a world where too much is changing too fast. ""Before My Time"" and ""Wayfaring Sranger"" are both breathtaking. Contrary to some early reviews I've read, Cash's voice has changed since his last solo outing. There is just a hint of frailty to the voice, and the occasional reaching for notes, but that only amplifies the material he has so ingeniously assembled here. I am neither a die-hard country listener nor a serious fan of Johnny Cash, yet I would include this album on my ""desert island"" list. It's a masterpiece, and a steal at any price."
4,Man in Black is Back!,"Though not as awe-inspiring as Cash's previous two releases on American (""American Recordings"" and ""Unchained""), this is another fine album from Cash, with a great supporting cast. I'm thrilled that Cash has recovered enough from his somewhat mysterious illness to be able to do one more record. The first couple of songs--""Tom Petty's I Won't Back Down and Neil Diamond's Solitary Man--don't quite fit Cash's voice, but buy the time he hits U2's ""One,""--the album's highlight--he's rolling. This one is closer in style--choosing to focus on ballads rather than rockers--to ""American Recordings"" than to the more recent ""Unchained."" This album will be an essentially for anyone who admires Cash and his music."
4,Another wonderful recording,"On the American III, Johnny Cash's voice, now a more fragile instrument, touches your heart, while it moves your soul. The continuation of this incredible document (The ""American"" series)suffers only from some song selections that do not work to Cash's strengths. Some tunes like Neil Diamond's ""Solitary Man"" are a bit too slight, and a few of the folk tunes like ""Mary of the Wild Moor"" seem a bit out of place.But the good stuff is stunning. Cash's version of ""I See a Darkness"" is amazing. (When he sings ""Ever notice the kind of thoughts I got,"" it sends a chill up your spine.)""The Mercy Seat"" with its brutal imagery of death by electric chair(""And I think my head is melting"")is an amazing combination of Cash's increasing intensity with Benmont Trench's haunting piano.This is a worthy addition to this series and a great part of the legacy of one of America's true orignals."
3,Decline of a true legend,"Not for lack of ambition, but this album falls flat to me. American Recordings is a fantastic record, but this one doesn't live up to it. On this album Johnny's voice always sounds very tired and he keeps to a very narrow range. The song choice is good, but I would have loved to have heard them done by him ten years ago. I would love to sing the praises of this album, but I can't. Only 'Country Trash' and 'Would You Lay With Me' really work for me. If you don't already have it, buy American Recordings first, then some of his classics, then come back for this one."
3,Better recordings have been made...,"Sorry to say, but Cash's voice is terminally flat in this album. The music is not really all it could be. On one hand, I'm glad he's still making music, on the other, maybe it's quittin' time --for a while.Better cd's in the last few years to spend your money on: ""American Recordings"" and ""Unchained""..."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I loved Unchanined because I felt it was a depature from Johnny's usual formula of singing about experiences he never had and was actually based on his own life. That album was amazing, but this album is choppy and disjointed. The songs are weak, and almost painful to listen to after hearing the power of Unchained, Love-God-Murder or even Storytellers with Willie Nelson. Don't waste your money on this one when there are much better J.Cash albums out there. To me, this was more slick marketing of the cool retro Johnny Cash persona than seriously powerful art. If you like Johnny Cash, listen to Merle Haggard - his work is generally based on experience not fiction."
1,Unemotional and Lackluster,"I'm a Johnny Cash fan, don't get me wrong. I've seen him in concert , I own a good many of his works. I bought this CD after seeing some stellar reviews of it in the local papers. Unfortunately, I found myself advancing from track to track trying to find some emotion in Johnny's vocal chords. His voice on this is rambling, bland and lackluster. He's TALKING more than singing and he's talking in a way that, if he were in front of me, I would probably be counting sheep.There's also something missing in that familiar voice that is hard to explain."
5,Just amazing...,His voice is incomparable and the arrangements are wonderful. Johnny Cash's version of Nick Cave's The Mercy Seat makes up for his inclusion of Tom Petty's I Won't Back Down.
5,The Master's Voice,"If you're expecting the younger bravado of hits like 'Ring of Fire' and 'I Walk the Line,' prepare to be treated to something better. The man has walked the long hard road and arrived at that point where his soul is showing. The bass voice is intact. The timbre is improved with age... and the meaning that is poured into the music is magnified by the fact that all of us are older now. The range in this recording strikes me as wider than usual. Not just a mixture of old and new country, but a blend of this and that. Listen to this one as background music first. Then sit down and really listen. All this one lacks is a reprise of 'One Piece at a Time' for its humor, but I won't complain. Thank you, Mr. Cash!"
4,a matter of life and death,"This is a truly moving album - full of wisdom and wonder, wit and weariness. it starts off in an almost poppy vein with the folky twang of tom petty, but all to soon the real mood of the album comes through with the spectacularly moving double whammy of i see a darkness and the mercy seat. these two troubled prayers to God and death are the highlight of the album. maybe the highlight of Cash's career. its an awesome album in every respect. Hell, it even makes a U2 song listenable."
4,Soul music of another kind,"The recent re-releases (Love, God, Murder, and the Folsom and San Quentin prison sets) seemed to suggest that Cash was now destined for relic status. Far from it. This album is a relevation. Cash's inspired versions of Will Oldham's ""I See a Darkness"" and Nick Cave's ""The Mercy Seat"" show that he is more than willing to push the ""alternative"" envelope. More than that, he's stamped his dignified moral authority all over them, as is the case, to a lesser extent, with David Coe's ""Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)"" and U2's ""One"". Of the Cash originals, ""I'm Leaving Now"", a duet with Merle Haggard, is probably the best. Another highlight is Sheryl Crow's appearance on ""Field of Diamonds"". Like ""Unchained"", the album features Tom Petty and various Heartbreakers providing sparse, acoustic support, with production by Rick Rubin. I've had a promotional copy for a few days now, and it hasn't left the player yet. And probably won't for some time."
5,The Perfect Team,"I've waited years to see this dream realized and it is as wonderful a blessing to mankind as I could have ever hoped!Johnny Cash and Nick Cave - The Mercy SeatAlthough the entire album is superb, I believe ""The Mercy Seat"" to be the most powerful song Johnny Cash has ever recorded. The vocal delivery of the two men are incredibly similar and Cave's lyrics are more Cash than Cash! A perfect pairing that I hope won't end with this album...Oooh... to hear/see Cash sing with The Bad Seeds!"
4,Respect Your Elders,"Another shining example of how the worldly-wise can provide re-interpretations of songs that outshine the originals. Johnny Cash astounds even further with a faade of austere, almost deadpan vocal delivery that still cannot mask how intimately he connects with the subject matter of the songs. This album bridges generations of musical interpretation and insight, as veteran Cash tackles material from both sides of the contemporary spectrum: that of marginalised and more extreme tunesmiths (Will Oldham, Nick Cave) as well as work by half-decent songwriters who have been more concerned with commercial success than breathing life into their own creations (Tom Petty, Neil Diamond, U2)."
1,"Well researched, but does not do the title justice","Paxman's analyses of the English is little more than a collection of well-known clichés. There are historical references (though not always accurate) and numerous quotations, which Paxman uses as a veneer to cover his own prejudices. If you want a book about Jeremy Paxman, this may be worth a read - but please ignore the title."
2,Read Watching the English Instead,"Oh, honestly, Jeremy. Moan, moan, moan. You can't soften us up by putting one sentence in at the end about us being 'modest, individualistic' and a couple of other 'ics' having spent 265 pages complaining. I know we like to complain but the key is to be funny while we complain, and this book doesn't do it. Readers, go and get Kate Fox's Watching the English instead. Much more entertaining and illuminating."
2,not worth reading,"If perchance you're thinking of using this book to get to know the English better but are not yourself English, you're going to have to go elsewhere. This book is written by an Englishman as a sort of sardonic take on the national character. As such, it contains many references to people, places, and events that probably only someone who grew up in England would get.And if you're thinking of using this as part of a cultural studies or intercultural communication course, you can forget it. It's far too literate. The whole level of the thing, it's like it was designed to elicit wry smiles from the crowd of people who read The New Yorker, the Atlantic, Best American Essays, etc.Another problem is the publication date (1999), which means that, even though it's only ten years old, it's out-of-date regarding Britian's problem with immigrants."
5,"Excellent, insightful","Honestly, as a Brit, this book is thoroughly entertaining and really, truly informative. All sorts of little gems whether historical, political, or simply hitherto unknowns. This is the sort of book that you can read straight through or just keep by the bed to dip into. Incredibly well researched. Yes, sure, it's older (1999) but just bear that in mind. It is quite possible that some of the childhood touchstones may be more pertinent to someone who grew up in the UK, but perhaps not much more than I experience reading a host of American non-fiction books? Dry, wry, witty, sardonic, entertaining, intelligent and... I'm here to buy a second copy having left my last one on a plane."
4,Very entertaining and enlightening,"As a US ex-pat who has lived in Britain for 11 years, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Yes, it is a highly personal and opinionated book, but who wants to read a list of statistics? Besides, it's what Mr Paxman does best. It shows another endearing characteristic of the English - the tendency to declaim on anything without worrying about whether they actually know much about it and often being very entertaining while doing it.The book is chiding without being churlish, funny without being farcical, and at times downright affectionate. It does get slightly repetitive and rambling, but I highly recommend it. It is a great conversation starter and at times made me laugh out loud.Oh - and also - the ""curiously English geek quiz show, University Challenge"" actually started in the US as College Bowl before coming to the UK. But it is indeed far more popular here than it was there. Does this say something else about the English perhaps?"
4,wonderful!,This is an amazing keyboard for the money. Tone is exceptionally beautiful and there are lots of bells and whistles. Only one drawback is the readability of the display box.
5,very pleased,"i am very pleased with this keyboard. it is better than expected, with good sound, many features, and low price.one comment about the A/C adapter. it was too cleverly hidden among the packing and we almost missed it, actually threw the box away and had to retrieve it. if the shipper would put a note or arrow on the piece of packing where it is hidden, that would probably help."
4,Yamaha YPT-200AD Electric Grand Piano,"For the money, this is a very good quality instrument. Good sound and reasonably intuitive functions and features."
4,Best book For beginners,"This book clearly explains about object oriented concepts & C++. The features of C++ have explained so well with greater detail. It creates interest to Learn C++. I read 4-5 books of C++ including The C++ Programming Language( Bjarne Stroustrup, Good for reference only)."
3,Good Book --lousy interactive component,My main complaint is that the waite group has not got their act together on their web site. It is suppossed to have email lists -- I have not recieved one mailing yet.. They do not tell you that the interaction is largely online grading of multiple choice questions. You recieve only a limited number of emailed assistance chances..All in all a very dissapointing site..
1,Use with Windows95 and IE 3 only,The CD won't install unless you have Windows 95 and internet explorer 3 installed on your system.
5,This is a must buy,I saw HipBootJoe when I was down in New orleans not too longago and decided to buy their cd. It ROCKS. I absolutley love it.
1,Not Helpful for Carpal Syndrome,"This is described as a ""wrist splint"" that ""holds the wrist in a neutral position"". In fact, it is not a splint and at best can only be described as providing a gentle guide to the correct neutral position. I've had carpal tunnel syndrome for a long time and the only reason I have avoided surgery is that I immobilize my wrist at night and when working on the computer. I don't see how this product could help anyone with carpal tunnel syndrome."
4,I disagree....,"I first saw this movie last fall on one of the pay movie channels and enjoyed it. While it certainly is not a work of artistic genius, it's a fun movie to watch late at night and I thought it had sufficient eroticism and suspense to keep me watching. It is the sort of movie that won't require much thinking but it fulfills its purpose of entertaining and I tend to be one that is very critical of the mindless material the movie industry now releases."
4,Modest but pleasing modern noir,"Henry Czerny plays a married Doctor ,asked by his vacationing neighbours to keep an eye on their nubile teenage daughter,who is being harrassed by a fellow student unable to accept the end of their affair.An affair develops betweem them and she films him getting dressed afterr a sex session,which is somewhat unfortunate as she is shortly afterwards murdered,placing him in an invidious position as he wrestles with both conscience and adesire to protect his freedom,marriage and social standing.The plot is well worked out although the murderer is easily spotted.Good acting and direction make for a pleasing time passer"
3,"OK, I Guess","Interesting story line, but acting is flat and characters not very well developed. The actor who plays the immoral doctor is good at being full of fear and guilt, but doesn't have a personality beyond that. Could have been done better."
4,loved it,"the first time i saw this i was looking for a movie with a good sex scene, wont deny it. the title screams sex movie to me for some reason. but its not a sex movie to watch if youre really horny or looking for something similar to porn, theres only one scene, and its nothing specialBUTthe movie itself was great. i liked the plot. i disagree with the review that says its predicatble. the only parts that are predictable are written about on the plot synopsis on the back of the DVD case. trust me, this movie has a great twist.polly shannon was amazing, i actually ended up quite attached to her character. the other actors were not too specialbut with this price you have nothing to lose."
5,what is like living as scholar,"Several others reviewed this book already. but I want to mention a point on this book. You could peep into what is the life of scholar throughout reading this book. this book is not merely writing guide. there are many other books on writing. but the place where this book should be put is not there, I think. the author, he himself has some name in Sociology, show you what is the life of scholar by the topic of writing. he persuasively illustrate the fear to write of not only graduate students but also professional scholars. I recommend to read Randall Collins¡ ¡The Sociology of Philosophies¡, if you want to peep into more details on the life of scholar. I think Collins¡s book is better, volumetric and systematic on that matter. But the merit of this book is that you can capture what is like living as scholar in more private sight."
4,"To the Point, Easy Language","The author provided a guide to assist the social scientist in writing clear, concise articles, books, etc. Tips for revising/editing were helpful, as were the suggestions for overcoming procrastination, and finding critical colleagues to assist in the process. The tips, I think, were helpful; however, as the author points out, many scientific journals are not interested in articles that are clear and concise."
3,"""ROLLERCOASTER"" REDUX","This is a reissue of Moira Johnston's 1990 book, ""Rollercoaster"" which covered the Bank of America's history from inception through the late 1980's. While this was a good book in its time, the reissue, unfortunately, has not been updated (except for the title). If you're looking for any insight into the Bank's merger with NationsBank, then you'll have to look elsewhere."
1,WHAT A LOAD OF GARBAGE!,"UGHH! These were the absolute worst books I've ever read in my life! These are my first books by Stephen King and will certainly be my last. What was wrong with SK? Could he not think of different character names? All the characters had the same names in both novels yet completely different people. The plot jumps around so much you begin to feel dizzy. One minute it seems to be getting interesting, the next your completely lost again! These books were sooo awful I almost threw them out the window halfway through, but forced myself to read it hoping they would get better. Boy was I wrong! COMPLETE GARBAGE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR BETTER YET YOUR TIME!"
2,King not at his best,"I am an avid King fan. I have read most of his books and am intrigued by his prose. But not this time. Character development is minimal and you never grow to care about the characters like you did in ""It"" or ""The Gunslinger"" and others. Shock value is used loose and wild in these. I don't mind a little gore, but I quit reading ""The Regulators"", because it was senseless and went on and on. ""Desperation"" is the better of the two. I think maybe King ought to slow down and develop his stories, they may be getting to perverse for even me."
2,Not much there,"These videos are pretty mind-numbing. When we first watched, my five year old started asking, ""When does it start?"" after about five minutes because he expected some kind of narrative rather than mere repetition of different phrases in fairly uncreative ways. These two women are well-intentioned, but I'm afraid the two videos of theirs we have are not very successful. Try Susy Dorn or even Professor Parrot instead."
5,"The best of the best, plus 2 great news ones","If you like the Indigo Girls already, you know what you're getting here. But the 2 new songs are very good. Amy's new one, ""Devotion,"" is a kind of stomping folk ditty with lots of acoustic guitars and harmonies. Emily's ""Leaving"" is a mid-tempo ballad about traveling and going...which seems to be the theme of lots of her songs lately.If you're just checking IG out for the first time, this is, say it with me, an excellent introduction. They rule. They rock. They make me cry and laugh and sing and dance. All at once."
4,The Power of Two.,"I normally don't listen to this kind of stuff, but I was won over by the sound and talent of these two. Great melodies and meaningful lyrics are just a couple of the things I like. The more popular songs are on here, like ""Closer to Fine"", ""Power of Two"", and ""Least Complicated"", but I really like ""Three Hits"", and ""Galileo"" just as much. I wish ""Back Together Again"" was on here, but otherwise this has everything I know by them. It's hard to compare them to anyone, but ""CSN"", ""Simon and Garfunkel"", and ""Cowboy Junkies"" come to mind, kind of. If you want just one ""Indigo Girls"" cd, this is the one."
3,could have been better!,"I have been a loyal fan for years. I was a little dissapointed in this collection for two main reasons. First, one of their best albums was largely overlooked: Nomads, Indians and Saints. Watershed is the only song chosen to represent this fine album. Second, true fans will agree that the 'hits' that were chosen were not true absolute favorites by longtime fans. As good as the songs are, gems such as ""pushing the needle too far"", ""southland in the springtime"" and ""Virginia Wolff"" were left off. That's just to name a few. I love the girls, and the new songs are great. However, if you want a true greatest hits, check out the live 1200 curfews or the import called 4.5."
4,all their greatest songs on one disc,If you like the Indigo Girls then you will love this disc. It has many of their best songs on it and for the price of $6.98 you cant beat it.
4,not a greatest hits,"judging by the people who are disappointed with the content of INDIGO GIRLS - RETROSPECTIVE, no where on the cd does it say greatest hits, it does say retrospective which simply means looking back, sure some of my favorites are missing, i think emily's LEEDS would have been on had i chosen, and CHICKENMAN, TOUCH ME FALL, & ROMEO AND JULIET, are 3 of amy's that i feel are essential, in fact not having at least one of amy's rave-ups deducted a star from my point of view. but that's not really the point they chose the tunes and if you are not an indigo girls fan, owning everything, this would be a great first purchase. you could go from here to the rest of the catalog with ease. my advice is if you have all the cds in their catalog this would have to be worth it from the inclusion of the 2 new songs and the liner notes. but if you are a casual listener and want to get exposed to indigo girls this would be a good first step as would 1200 CURFEWS."
2,Where's Canaan,"Fatally flawed for not containing ""Land of Canaan."" Plus, with them collected together like this, it becomes painfully obvious that the songs contain too much earnestness and too little humor. The lyrics sound cribbed from the battered spiral notebook of some too-sensitive collegiate English major. Boooring, with only ""Closer to Fine"" showing any spark."
4,Ford at Fox Collection,Ford At Fox - The CollectionThe Box is quite a bargain. Even though some of the films are a bit datedthey are still fun to watch. The picture quality of the older films is surpraisingly good. John Ford wasn't just a director of western. Recomanded not only to John Ford-Fans.
3,A Good Oldie: Up the River,"This video was colorized by Ted Turner, apparently as the colors are subdued and bland. The music was like that in ""Guys and Dolls"" with a prison band and at the ballgame. Clare Luce was a gangster's moll, with hair like mine. The entertainment in prison (Up the River) was black face, one played a bozoo like those two crazies. A long horn was used in vaudeville.Tempers flare backstage. In the prison, the majority of inmates was white, and mean like those we know as internet bullies. ""My Buddy"" was on the old time victrola. M O T H E R was sung by a tenor. ""Be Kind to your Feathered Friends"" was funny. On the hayride with four horses, there was singing and meriment. Those men in white pants and dark tops are on old fashioned radio."
1,BE AWARE !,"This material you receive when you order this course is not the one that is advertised. You only receive an introductionary package, and instead of 8,000 real-life color pictures, as advertised here, you only receive lessons covering 900 real-life color pictures.You're basically only getting 1/10 of what you think you will get !The complete course however is a great tool to work with - and together with this introductions from Amazon - I received a special offer giving me a 50 % discount if I ordered the complete set (8,000 real-life color pictures)from Rosetta Stone. This course however prised at $ 195.00 each (2 parts)Be aware !"
2,Limited Application.,"The learner is under the complete control of the learning method. There is no easy way to learn what YOU want to learn. After umpteen lessons, I found that I still did not know how to say, ""How are you?"" or ""I am fine, thank you."" In fact the pronoun 'I' is never taught at all. However, if you want to learn to say, ""The children are dancing in the street"" or ""He is jumping into the pool"", and many other useless phrases, this is the program for you."
4,"Good product, but has a severe flaw","I found this product does teach you basic words and thoughts better than other CD's I've tried for language learning. However, the flaw is that the CD must be loaded, and the further you get into the lessons, the slower it gets. Further, when you go back and forth between the lessons, it doesn't cache anything, so it's like accessing it for the first time. (i.e. slow as molasses)Consider this product as an introductory product, because it doesn't teach you sentence structure, only random events that could occur in your life. But, those events do surface clearly when that occurs. That is, it seems a lot easier to remember because of the combination of phrases attached to pictures."
3,Not bad at all,I travel to Europe often but have never been to France so I am using this software in hopes that I will learn enough French to at least carry on a conversation. I borrowed both the Spansih and French versions of this software from a neighbor and I am really enjoying this software. The method is so different from what I am used to and it has broken the monotony. I have learnt several phrases already. But I am getting a feeling that something is missing. I don't feel that I am learning any grammar with this course. My Spanish isn't bad so that has helped since I am already somehwat familiar with the grammar of romance languages. But if I didn't know any romance language grammar at all I think the lack of grammar in this course would have been an insurmountable learning obstacle.
1,Doesn't teach sentence structure or grammar,"This product is great if you want to learn a few phrases and words but it won't even come close to teaching you the language. It doesn't provide any way in which to learn sentence structure or grammar. I have heard the bigger and more complete personal editions by Rosetta Stone are better than this but still fail to teach grammar. If you want a well rounded product, that also will teach you grammar, take a look at Transparent Language's French NOW."
1,Don't buy it,"If I had known I could take all my shaky, amateurish home vacation videos and sell them, I'd be rich! My wife and I couldn't believe we paid money for a homemade vacation video you'd never agree to watch except at the insistence of an old friend and then only after a few glasses of wine. Unbelievable. A monkey comes into the scene; caption: ""Monkey"". Hilarious! Note to videographer: ""hostal"" is correctly spelled HOSTEL."
5,"Terrific for Writers, Students, Anyone",Great for settling arguments or making sure you're using the correct terminology. I actually bought two - one for my daughter. An awesome resource!
2,A bit of a letdown,"This album lacks the adventurous nature of his previous work. It's still good music but not nearly so engaging or interesting as before. If dancing to the music is your only interest than I guess this will do it for you though... I keep listening in hopes of hearing something that I've missed, but the tunes ARE more simple."
3,pretty good,"Not so bad, this one. Some of it and this is an acquired taste - but I think it's worth it. Good, deep, bass-y beats."
2,"Not a bad dictionary, but...","The dictionary in the back was helpful, but the organization of the book is not very good and it is awful in explaining pronunciation. After studying it faithfully and trying it out, my Nepali friends, finally, asked in English, ""What are you trying to say?"" I also learned that some of the information was inaccurate. I hate to speak badly of it, since it is about the only Nepali language travel book on the market, but, hopefully Lonely Planet will consider an overhaul."
2,Just buy the book in Nepal,"And you find better ones. Lonley planet again fails to deliver with yet another product. The organization is poor, bad choice of phrases, etc..Heres a tip: skip the book, goto Nepal, meet some Nepali's talk with them, learn a little, then go to the millions of bookstores in Khatmandhu and find a book that fits your needs.It may be this one, but I doubt it."
2,VERY Disappointing,"I got this for my Spanish-speaking wife for her to learn English, and had based my purchase on previous Instant Immersion Spanish software for myself, of which I've had favorable experiences.However, this software, perhaps because it is PC-based, rather than Mac like my previous Instant Immersion software, was horrible -- very poorly organized, random, incoherent lessons with a terrible interface. The user is on their own for most of the lessons; they don't explain words in context (i.e., root word, verb, subject, etc.) I paid about $80 for this but would have been disappointed if it were $29."
4,"I like them, just make sure to size up.","These are very nice boots at a fraction of the price of Uggs. I am normally a 7 or 7 1/2 in regular shoes. I bought these in a 9 and the length of the foot is perfect. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they don't fit as snug as I would like around the ankle, so they bulge a little under pants/jeans unless I wear large flares and also slide around a little when I walk. I guess they'd probably be okay to tuck skinny jeans into, but I haven't tried this yet. Still, they are a great purchase for the price. I got the lavendar color, which is pretty."
3,"Nice boot, but runs small.","Excellent price and well constructed, however, they run small. Buy a size larger, especially if you want to wear sox."
4,See For Yourself...,"I've applied calcium to my diet and I'm looking forward to living a long, cancer-free life. As with anything, read for yourself and make your judgement.I do recommend picking up this book not only to understand the benefits of taking ""proper"" calcium suppliments, but to become aware of the pharmacudical companies who may not have YOUR best interests in mind. If something like natural vitamins and minerals cannot be pattened, you can't monopolize the produt and make huge money doing it. I strongly believe that the way the harsh reviews below are written, they sound like ""Pharmecudical Big-Brother"" politics driving you away from natural vitamins and into chemical dependancies. Don't be too influenced by reviews...even this one, decide for yourself...."
4,calcium and the New Biology,"Very interesting read. It brings to mind that quality products are worth the price. Investing in trustworthy products such as ""Standard Process"" willrelieve one's anxiety about tainted calcium. No, I have no financial stakein SP. I simply purchase them from my health care provider.Also, ""The New Biology"" presented by Dr. Robert Young explains why calcifications in organs and tissues are present. They are not the causeof disease, tumors, etc. Calcium is simply present to try to protect and preserve the body by buffering acids with the alkalinity of calcium - oftenpulled from bones if not readily available in our diet.Dr. Young's work is coming to the front and books such as this onlyreconfirm my convictions."
1,Do Your Homework,"This book, along with the Bob Barefoot Infomercials that promote Coral Calcium, make some very interesting points. Please, before you start relying on the claims made in this book and the attendant Infomercials, do your own research - in this case, go to the Federal Trade Commission web site (www.ftc.gov) and search case file 0323064."
2,Mislabeled,Shipping weight = 12 poundsGiven the dimensions of the mattress topper that means the density is less than 2.5 pounds per cubic foot. How can they get away with calling this a 4lb density topper?
1,Deception in the Title,"The Title description for this product includes ""4 pound"" memory foam. That refers to density per cubic foot. This pad is almost exactly 5 cubic feet of foam, which would thus weigh 20 pounds. So, how can the shipping weight be only 12 pounds?"
2,"Can't see them, so what's the point?","Seemed like a good idea. I loaded up my clear clip, held the clip against a 4-foot flourescent bulb for 2 minutes, immediatly turned off the lights and shot rounds on a moonless night. You can't see them. Even the BB's that land on the ground close by are not really visible. I give it 2 stars because the quality of the BB's seems really good, they are smooth. Maybe if the BB's had more glowing additive, it might work. But I doubt it."
5,MUST HAVE GLOW IN DARK GUN: if you do they are great!,"Worth its price in the dispenser alone, with the tilted nozzle and screw-on cap.You must have a gun that is designed for GlowInDark ammo (it will place light on the ammo as it is fired), otherwise you will not be pleased. You will find the bottle easy to dispense into your airsoft gun of choice. Lots of fun at night or indoors with the lights out!Highly recommend indoor use, they are not so great the next day if fired and then left outside in the dew."
2,bad bbs dont buy,"I bought this thinking glow in the dark, cool!!!!!! but they are very crappy. They dont glow at all and they curve all over. Overall crappy bbs. spend more money on GOOD bbs.You need a tracer unit for them to glow."
2,"based only on simple memorization, not learning the language","this program shows you a picture of a boy, and all they give you is the word and how it's spelled; but they would give you a picture of boys, and how that's spelled, but there is no alphabet at all, no tenses, no prounouns, the adjectives are terrible in their descriptions, it does include a voice recognition in it, but it is lower than the low grade. This program is only for children. It is a great vocabulary builder however. that's why it only received 2 stars instead of 1."
3,Fun and Easy,"This program is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of the Arabic script (I would recommend ""My first 100 words in Arabic""). There is nothing in English which leaves the learner to figure many things out independantly, but I learn better this way. The only problem I had with this program is that the content is not very practical. I can say that ""the car is white"", but I still can't say ""How are You?"" I do have a very basic understanding of the grammar, but mostly just a wider vocabulary and a better understanding of the script. A lot of self-motivation is required to learn to speak with this program because there is no recording studio or anything to require speaking. I am glad that I bought it, though, and I think it will be very helpful to me while I continue to learn Arabic."
4,Short but entertaining.,"I wished this was longer and went into greater depth of the little things in life that changed during war time. There were some very interesting items, that unlesss you lived during those times you just wouldn't think about (driving without headlights at night, why street signs had to be taken down). It provides details of life at the time that only someone alive to live it could provide."
5,replacement Li-Ion battery,"Service was great,fast delivery for this hard to find battery for an aging cell phone. Will use this location again if the need arises.Thank you so much."
2,"Gorgeous photos, but not really quited for real life","Eve Pearl writes in her introduction that her roots are in theatrical makeup. That theme reoccurs in almost every makeover she does. While her tips are interesting, some of them are just not really doable in real-life working situations. For example, of you cover your entire mouth in foundation and redraw your lips, it looks like you re-drew your lips. It's not any special effect. But in a photo studio, with nice lights and special lenses, it can look like you had lip surgery. The basic principles behind her suggestions are based on contouring and illusion. It was an interesting read, but not worth to buy it. The before-and-after photos are quite remarkable, but if you can tell in the photo that the subjects have 3 inches of makeup on, how awful would they look upclose and personal?"
3,still nothing that new,"I bought this book for the purpose of gaining new and insightful makeup tricks and tips. I didn't find them in this book. I own many makeup books and have learned many techniques over the years. Unfortunately this book didn't really impress me. Every make-up book explains what foundation is and why you need to pluck your brows, but I need something new! I wouldn't recommend it if you own at least one of the popular makeup books"
3,Too much work,"This is a very informative book and the techniques and photos are very good. But unless you're willing to spend a lot of time sculpting your face with a lot of product, including a lot of heavy coverage product, you will be disappointed. If you, like me, just have some undereye darkness, freckles and age spots you want to blend, this is overkill.Recommend you first read Carmindy's ""Get Positively Beautiful,"" available here at Amazon for only $8.80.Get Positively Beautiful: The Ultimate Guide to Looking and Feeling GorgeousYou'll learn to be less critical of your ""flaws."" Carmindy's makeovers of real women alone are worth the price of the book.Also, try Facial Magic facial exercise to tighten up the face instead of botox or the knife. It works for me and is a lot cheaper than having work done.Facial Magic Basic Kit [VHS]"
2,plastic surgery without surgery,"The seller sent this book to me in extra quick time. I am pleased with how smooth the purchase went. This book isn't quite what I was expecting. It is morning show tips and tricks. I didn't need to buy a book to learn this stuff. I am sort of bummed that I bought it since most is common sense, and the rest is the trend of the day, and you hear about it on the talk shows and morning shows and such. Oh well, you can't win em all. But the seller was great."
3,"this is great, I only paid 10.00 for it",this is a great cd. we listen to it everyday and night. you should by this its so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so hilarious
4,Wonderful Listen !,"This is the best B.A.D. record. Wonderfully melodic and focused. Songs seguesweetly in a sensible manner with great production touches. Rewind kicks things off with a rush and the warmth of Everybody Needs a Holiday and London Bridge at the end, awesome. A great flow, excellent road album. This is easily the most cohesive record the group made."
3,"Good, Inconsistent","There was a time when I spun this over and over. But after giving it a rest for a good 12 years I put it on the other day. There a definitely some great tracks - Rewind, Contact, Union Jack, Stalag 123. But the production doesn't wear well. In this day, the sounds and style are watered-down house. The song-writing, on the better tracks, is pretty good and while I wouldn't call the other songs filler, they aren't as strong. It's all pretty catchy, but I find I like humming the melodies with the CD off better than listening to the cheese.The other BAD CDs sound a bit more timeless for some reason, perhaps that they didn't push the production aspect so hard and sound more like a band. Overall, a good album to have but maybe not a first. 'This is BAD' is a great place to start and I don't like 'Tighten Up' at all so this pretty much falls in the middle."
3,The weakest B.A.D. studio album,"I am that rare individual who owns more Big Audio Dynamite albums than Clash albums. B.A.D.'s style was more appealing to me, I guess. Nevertheless, I have to say that ""Megatop Phoenix"" is the weakest of the band's original studio albums. There are some good songs, particularly ""Contact,"" ""Around the Girl in 80 Ways,"" and ""James Brown."" But overall, the album contains a lot of fairly bland filler material. Bandleader Mick Jones seemed to sense this, firing the other members and bringing in a whole new crew before the next album. In retrospect, the move was a wise one."
3,Fascinating but Flawed,"This book offers a insider's view of the intelligence community which in themselves is fascinating, but there is no way to check on its authenticity. Might this be another form of 'misinformation' by itself? Such is the paranoia that pervades the book and its historical case studies that slowly but surely indoctrinates its readers. In this respect, the book succeeds very well in representing the subject that it dwells on.However, it remains a very Western account on the world of espionage. Laffin doesn't really explain why he thinks the Chinese intelligence is one of the best and most dangerous (and to whom?). Accordingly, East Asia and Southeast Asia are effectively ignored. I would like to have seen at least one case history about intelligence and espionage work in these regions..."
2,SO MUCH TROUBLE IN THE ...SOUND,IT'S THE THIRD JAPANESE IMPORT THAT I BOUGHT AND I NEVER THOUGHT THE SOUND QUALITY COULD BE SO BAD FOR A PRICE LIKE THAT.IF YOU THINK ABOUT BUYING JAPANESE'S IMPORT CHECK THE SOUND BEFORE YOU BUY IT .IN MY CASE I AM A HUGE FAN OF MARLEY SO I BOUGHT IT TO LISTEN TO SONGS THAT I NEVER HEARD LIVE BEFORE .IF YOU ATTEMPT TO COLLECT ITEMS OF BOB IT WORTH IT .PEACE AND LOVE ALL OVER THE WORLD JAH SAID .MIKE FROM ISRAEL .
2,Halo 2 Collectors Edition Feedback,Disk was scratched so game play was freezing and some game content could NOT be loaded. Cover was in a very poor condition. I'm a disappointed with the product.
1,What state ???,This is not a review. I have NOT read the book.If this area is in California why is the title of the book Colorado ???
5,On Mermaid Avenue,"This book is amazing. Though quite flamboyant and seemingly ""carefree"" it gives SUCH careful consideration to relationships of all sorts...and especially relationships between women. Though it made me a little sad, it painted a perfect picture of a friendship progressing through all high and low points. I don't want to give anything away, so I will simply say, ""IT MUST BE READ!"", by men and women alike. Everyone has something to gain from this book. Binnie Kirshenbaum is a genius."
5,i live on mermaid avenue,if you have a friend and you read this book and you still have a freind and she reads this book and you are still friends and it is five years later read the book again and remember why you are friends.
4,A Reference For Test Methodology,"Mr. Gladstone has put together an excellent little reference for anyone tasked with testing a system. Whether testing computer telephony systems, networks, or almost any other kind of system the steps outlined are worth following.A bonus is the detail in PBX and IVR technology the reader will find.Skip chapters 13 and 14 if you don't want the sales pitch for Hammer Systems. Just don't skip the summary and appendix."
4,Gotta love those Killer Dwarfs,"I don't have much to say, but the Killer Dwarfs have definitely put out some good songs including ""It doest matter at all"" and ""Last Laugh"". Dave (a respected hard-rocker in the underworld) agrees with me on this point. If you want to listen to some exceptional music by the Killer Dwarfs, then check out ""Keep the spirit alive"". Probably their best song of all time."
5,Green Angel,"One of my students,Fernand Thibault recently read this short novel and wrote the following commentary/review.""Green Angel is about sorrow and grief. The main character Green loses her family in a community tragedy. This leaves her to fend for herself and to deal in her own unique way with the impact of these major losses. Alone with the family terrier, Onion, this shy 15 year old struggles with how to establish new relationships with other survivors. This beautifully written prose examines sorrow, strength, forgiveness and the courage of a 15 year old determined to rebuild her life in her hometown."""
4,Beautifully Written!,"Green Angel is not a very long book, and is an easy, delightful read. It is a story of hope and strength and survival. The imagary is beautiful. Green is a strong character, and following her on her journey back to herself was a positive experience for me. It reminded me that even in our darkest hour, there can be light and hope. I recommend for teenagers and adults alike!"
5,A poetic jewel,"Green Angel is a very lovley book. It brings you into the mind of a 15, soon to be 16, year old girl.Green, who is very shy, and quiet, loves to plant,and is very beautiful, loses her family. Green loses, her mother, who taught her everything about planting, her father, to whome she loved, and most of all, her younger sister,aurora, who never forgot about Green, and always thought of her older sister. Green goes mad, she slowly rips her old self apart. She sews thorns on her jacket, and nails on her shoes,tatoos herself with ink, and chops her beautiful hair off. she slowly transforms into another person, but doesn't regognize her own self. You'll have to read the book to see the the ending. This is a must read, you wont be able to take your eyes of the pages!"
2,"yeah, yeah...","Yeah, yeah, Alice Hoffman writes a young adult book, blah blah blah. I found this to be overly prosy and immaturely crafted. It tried to have a dark goth sense about it and perhaps that's just not my genre. I finished it in about an hour (it's only 116 pages long) so I can't rightly say it's ""one I've put back down"", but I wouldn't read it again or give it to a friend. I think I would have enjoyed this book when I was an early teenager and going through my ""nobody understands me and my deep poetry"" phase. So there's that going for it."
4,A green triumph over tragedy,"This was a fast read, but not necessarily an easy one! After an undisclosed tragedy (my mind kept flipping between Hiroshima and Sept. 11), Green's family is all killed. She explores the ""why not me?"" question beautifully. It is interesting to see the responses of a 15 year old girl left only to her own inner direction. I enjoyed the story, but I felt I was always looking through a scope that limited my vision, cutting off most of the scene and only showing me Green. As usual, Hoffman is able to truly capture the human spirit in her story!"
4,Pure Imagination Reviews,"This book may be only 116 pages but it is filled to the brim with story. Green has a very close relationship with her family. Her mother collects Blue Jay feathers, her father can whistle any tune, flawlessly, and her little sister is made from moonlight. They are all so interlinked that it may be impossible for Green to get over their lose.This is my first experience with Hoffman, and it was exactly what I was expecting. Magical. It has a fairy tale feel, but almost better. It's...more. It's not your everyday fairy tale. This is magical realism at it's best. I urge you to take an hour and read it! You won't be disappointed."
4,Another Hoffman Winner,"This is one of the shortest books I've read in the past few years. I was able to finish it in under two hours.A young girl (of unknown nationality) goes about her complacent routine until one day a tragedy befalls a nearby city and she loses her entire family. Told by the girl herself, it tells of her hope that her family will return, her denial that they won't return after time passes, her fears at being alone, her grief at losing those dear to her. We learn how she copes with being alone in a time of turmoil; her acceptance that there are others worse off than she; and of how she learns that life goes on regardless of what happens around us.A compelling, gripping story; packs a lot of punch into a few pages."
3,quick. interesting read,"it was deffinately different. i loved the third angel, so i thought i'd give this little book a try. i enjoyed it, but it was pretty childish, which is ok..that's what it was supposed to be. i guess it just wasnt what i was expecting. still good, just not as great as i'd hoped for."
4,Short & sweet,"Hoffman's bitter-sweet tale of grief and rebirth carries the reader gently along. A journey full of lost, found and growth."
3,green angel,"A girl named Green was known for her skills in the garden.Her sister Aurora was the youngest and the silliest.One day her parents and sister went to the city,and a fire started.It killed her family.Now Green has no love for anything.Green has put tattoos on her body,cut her hair,and put nails in her boots.Over time Green began to love again.As her garden grew her tattoos began to brighten.I recamend this book,this girl who has went through her family's death,and still has love in her heart."
4,Interesting Analogy of 9/11,"Alice Hoffman has created a world that mirrors our own after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The main character, Green, loses her parents and sister in a disaster and over the course of the book, comes to terms with her losses. This is a poignant tale of mourning and rebirth over time. At times some of the incidents seem a little strained but Green's descent into ""Ash"" and eventual coming to terms with herself are excellent. There are a few unresolved issues in the story but overall this is an excellent parable. Recommended."
4,i collect anything by tasha tudor so indeed i like this book,product packed nicely arrived in due time enjoy tasha tudor books this is first copy of this particular book and i would recommend it for anyone who likes tasha would consider sending to great grandchildren thank you
5,"Beautiful, Quality Book and wonderful Keepsake","This is a beautiful book with lovely illustrations and cherished memories from beloved Tasha.This is the type of book to keep forever and pass down to the children in the family as a treasured keepsake. I thought the quality overall was very, very good: the illustrations were clear and sharp and the colors were soft yet strong; the paper was substantial; the print was clear and hardback cover was very sturdy.I proudly gave it as a gift and the receiver absolutely loved it!"
2,Not thrilled about this book.,I was a bit disappointed with the content and quality of illustrations. I am a big fan of Tasha Tudor and had seen bits and pieces of her work on a public television documentary and wanted to see more. It did not fulfill my expectations. The drawings were coarse and rudimentary.
1,around the year,i could not find any magic in this book. the style is the same but the pictures and colors are just not magical. i hope it is the printers fault. i was also not happy with the amount of information in book. prehaps you should describe these books better. this is the 5th. tasha tudor that i have bought from you and the first i have not liked.
4,Su Mejor Propuesta Musical,"El disco empieza con el hit ""Dame Dame Dame"" que pego fuerte en la isla y tuvo una buena clasificacion en las lista de Hot Latin Tracks de billboard, asi que tanto como en PR y las emisoras tropicales en los Estados la cancion fue buen recibida for los fanaticos. Las canciones 2,3,5 y nueve son buenas canciones tambien. La cancion 6 es una buena bachata. Espere algo nuevo de ella, posiblemente entre los primeros tres meses del 2002; como este disco."
5,classic indigo girls,"this is an essential introduction to the indigo girls for the novice listener. the music, lyrics and beautiful harmonies are classic IG and foretell greater things to come (which, of course, did.) ""love's recovery"" has become one of my all-time favorite tunes over the years and it is as fresh today as it was when i saw this pair in concert many, many moons ago. ""prince of darkness"" is likewise timeless. these ladies each have their own distinct musical styles and the beauty of their music is how the styles ""mesh"" into harmonious musical delight."
5,"A MUST HAVE. . .for anyone, not just IG fans!","This is one of the Indigo Girls' most defining works. The album will literally lift you up, and put you in a new frame of mind. It has something for any kind of mood you could be in--from the raw and haunting pain in Amy's vocals on ""Blood and Fire"" to the optimistic message in Emily's ""Closer to Fine"". The album also features ""Kid Fears"" which includes vocals from R.E.M's Michael Stipe. This is not just female folk rock, it's the kind of music that REQUIRES you to sing along and to think while you're doing it. Emily and Amy have boundless talent and this is a shining example of it."
3,Not Remastered,"Just a note of warning... this CD was issued in 2000, but has NOT been remastered. I don't know where Amazon got the idea that this 2000 reissue was remastered, but it was not. The sound quality is exactly the same as the same cd that was issued back in 1989. The only difference is that this 2000 reissue adds two more songs and increases the volume a little bit. Don't fool yourself into thinking that this 2000 version might sound a little better... cause it doesn't."
5,I've grown up with them....,"There's some music that I listen to because I like the tune. Some I'm drawn to for the words. Very, very seldomly does a band pull me in with both aspects. The Indigo Girls, my friends, did. For life. I first heard this album when I was eight years old. I had a babysitter (named Amy, amazingly) that loved to play the guitar for me. After a few weeks I had the words to ""Closer to Fine"" down pat. It remains, years later, my favorite song. This album has gone with me everywhere. The songs have become parts of me, and marked the minutes of my life. When I have something to look forward to , ""Closer to Fine"" begins my day. In those pensive times, ""Secure Yourself"" is my anthem. After my first big breakup with a guy, I played ""Love's Recovery"" 15 times in a row. This music has molded me into who I am today. For every emotion, every dimema, every tear or smile that goes accross your countenance, the Indigo Girls have a song. Buy this album- it will change your life."
5,The best Indigo Girls CD. I love it.,"The best CD from a great duo. The sound is pure, the focus is needle sharp on whatever they are singing about. One of ten CDs I couldn't live without."
1,Rosetta Stone Italian,"This software is very misleading. I purchased Rosetta because it was described as being easy and very effective. The box advertises that this program is used by NASA, well I hope they don't use this version it only gives you 1/4 of the full program. The box makes you think your getting a complete program but your not. After you going through all the exercises just once to get a feel for it you find out you have to go online and buy the rest of the program. I've also purchased Smart Start Italian, Quick Study Italian and Transparency 51 Languages and all are 95 % better then this program."
4,This is the way to learn a foreign language,"I bought the Explorer AFTER I signed up for the free lessons that Rosetta Stone has on their website. I tried the French and the Portuguese lessons and was amazed at how quickly I learned the words. This is the way I learned English--symbol association, and it's the way a child learns its first language. How many times have you seen a parent point to a picture or a toy and say ""Lion"", or ""Dog"" to the child. The idea is bootstrap your knowledge by associating the word with the image in your head. The Explorer only offers the first 22 lessons of the Level I's 92 lessons. So, don't expect to be speaking in full sentences after going through the 22 lessons!"
4,can't ever get enough,"I love house music but this was pretty groovy with its gospel types vocals and lyrics. I enjoyed this album especially disc 1 tracks 2,3, 6, and 8. This is a laid back album you would listen to when you need some inspiration (6,8) or really in love (2,3 cd 1). Although I have bought other house of om cds, i just can't get enough of the variety of the djs.I hope you enjoy it!!!!"
1,someone must like it,"I didn't like a single song. Although I could tell there was a continuity to the style and tempo, so if you like one track you will probably like them all.I love groovy, funky, chill, dub, unclassifiable, yet couldn't find value in this collection. I'll give it one star for having a cool cover."
3,Misleading title,"From the title, one would expect <cite>Workshop Math</cite> to be about measurements and such in, you know, the workshop. Instead, it is almost entirely about houseframing. It is all right in that respect, but it offers little that you don't likely already know or could not figure out easily on your own. Explanations are overly wordy and could have been made more straightforward by a decent editor. It has enough value that I will not be disposing of my copy, but I suspect for the most part it will sit on my bookshelf unused."
3,Bad quality,There is this weird ringing going on in almost every song. It really takes away from the music. You might have better luck buying this on CD.
1,Not up to Snuff!,"I was not aware that this DVD was aimed at elementary/middle school students. The history was almost non-existent and the photography, although lovely, did not delve into some of the more interesting facts about the Alhambra. The Alhambra deserves better."
2,The CD is worth more,"I viewed the product as a hardcopy magazine for viewers who do not like to read.The Moors were ingenious and they need to come back home their garden is in need of fresh ideas. I am confident they will return if you really want a view of the garden ""The Alhambra on CD will help you visualize it the conquers of the Moorish Garden did some redecorating. I am sure they would agree a Moorish touch is still needed."
1,Not Powerful - Cumbersome to use,"This product is much larger and heavier that other products in the same category. It takes far too long to heat up and once it does, does not produce enough steam to effectively press the clothes. The water tank is fixed and difficult to fill, much less clean at a later date. We bought this for our second home and went back to a model that was more portable, stronger and had a removable water receptacle for ease of filling and cleaning."
2,not for light stethoscopes,"I have a Littman cardio stethoscope, very light, and it won't stay placed in the holder... it takes me forever to get it situated, so I end up throwing it around my neck again. Haven't used the holder since. My colleagues say for their heavy stethoscopes it works."
1,No it doesn't work,"Get a new copy of his first one and don't be fooled by this guest list because the beats are nothing like the Afros-meet-Check-Your-Head sound of ""The Hurra."" In fact nearly every moment here is complete trash, and I love all these people. Get N.A.S.A. if your into a sweet guest list that is actually palatable on the ears."
3,"nice, but very thin","I ordered the orange/white sarong, and it's really pretty, but it's very thin. If you plan on wearing without anything under it, like a dress, you won't be able to. And the it's a little see-through... That's why I'm giving it only 3 stars."
4,My favorite,"I purchased five sarongs from 1 world and this one is my fave. I love the size. I use them as neck scarves. Some patterns work better than others and this one is the best. It does have thick black fringe that isn't visible in the product photo. The fabric quality is pretty good but they smell bad. I washed them in my machine on ""handwash mode"" then dried them on the delicate cycle. They came out well. My only gripe is this material shows lint pretty badly in the darker colors."
5,Beautiful!,I cannot wait to wear this! It is stunning! Will go perfectly with my black swimsuit! Thank you!!!
1,SUCKS WORSE THAN HIS BASKETBALL TEAM,"it sucks, because the lyrics of the song, and the music arent good, and now his music is depressing like his life because hayley riebling is leaving for college"
4,Roy Orbison was magnificent,"Roy Orbison was one of the greatest singers of the 20th century. This video features all of his classics, including:1. Oh, Pretty Woman (intro)2. Only The Lonely3. In Dreams4. Mean Woman Blues5. Blue Bayou6. Candy Man7. Crying8. It's Over9. Oh, Pretty Woman10. Running Scared11. Leah12. Dream Baby13. Ooby DoobyNote - the title is a little confustion. This isn't the type of tribute that is being released these days where other people are doing covers of a legendary singer. This is video that was released in the mid-1980s featuring Roy Orbison and his band live - a fabulous concert!"
1,This show is no Battlestar Galactica,"After the incredible trip that was Battlestar Galactica, I was really looking forward to seeing what could be done with Caprica. The show started out fairly strong, but by the middle of the season it was very apparent that the plot and characters were going no where. By the end of season I could have cared less about the characters, what they felt, what they thought, where they were going, etc. The story line became very bogged down with minutiae. Even for a Battlestar plot line, the characters acted in contradictory manners. The ""character physics"" of the Caprica universe seemed to be ill defined and just not very interesting. I would really like to learn more about how the Cylons started, what was their relationship to their creators, etc. But I am just not willing to wade through all this crap to get there. I deleted Caprica from my Tivo line up, and I will not be adding it back for Season 2, should it ever see the light of day."
2,Confused,"How can Episode 11 be part of Season 1 if the description starts with ""After the devastating events of the season 1.0 finale,.....""Amazon, you dun goofed."
1,"Initially entertaining, then offensive and appalling.","Initially I found this TV show to be entertaining.Then, as the story moved forward I found this show to be offensive and appalling.It is as if the creators of this show intentionally attacked Yeshua Jesus Christ (who is Jehovah Yahweh, the one true Almighty God).Because of this I hate this show.This show is completely antichristian to its very core, so I rate this show with one star."
3,An unusual series but not an instant classic,"I never got to see it all during the original broadcast, so this was my chance to see the rest. The picture quality of the Amazon Prime presentation was wonderful and the episodes I watched were interesting though I cannot recommend the series overall for purchase, as it was a wandering mess with the overall story line. Cancelled for a reason...."
3,3.0/3.5 Rating because it takes place in the BSG Universe,"I love Science Fiction and the re-imagined series is hands down my favorite. Though Caprica lacked the grittiness and darkness of Battlestar Galactica, I enjoyed seeing more of the Colonies culture. I would say that the series as a whole is okay but the second half (1.5) is much better because the story telling becomes faster in pace and it starts getting darker."
3,"7 episodes in, I will give it an ""OK"" rating. Not good, but not bad.","I am a big BSG fan, so I was excited to hear a ""prequel"" of BSG was coming out. I definitely thought it would be interesting to see how the Cylons came into being. So we are 7 episodes in, watching weekly on SyFy channel, and I give it an ""OK,"" but reserve judgment to increase or decrease that rating later. To me, the characters aren't as compelling as in BSG. We do get to see Bill Adama as a young boy, and his father in his prime, but other than that, no other characters that will tie you back to BSG.I'm definitely going to keep watching, because I am hoping it will improve, but it definitely didn't draw me in the way BSG did. I couldn't wait for the next episode of BSG to air. However, this one I TiVo and forget about. I don't even watch it live because I can wait to skip the commercials."
3,Fine - what in the h3ll is goin' on/cliff-hanger writing - but,"I don't know if I can swallow the philosophic premise for the show ~ thoughIs religion really the culprit for man's ills or is it simply manattempting 2""scapegoat"" the issue by blaming religionIt seems that the religion in question harkens heavily toJudeo/ChristianityStrange that Zoe's religious revelation wouldn't have had a much more varied ~ paganistic flare ~ since the construct is supposed 2bthe product of life in Caprica ~&Does man have a soul or just a wild imaginationThe show doesn't really deal w/ origins for life ~ just the sentient origins for lifeAs for machines & man ~ what's the difference:I suppose man will always be the un-predictable & volitional organisms that machines may never b - as Richard Hatch was fond of saying :)Finely written cliff-hanger- intellectually ~ it's either pedestrain w/ it's thinking - propagandistor still a wrk in progressSeason 2 ~ pls :)"
4,Stands Alone,"You don't have to be a big fan of BSG to enjoy this series. I myself am not and I was pulled into the storyline. The drama is literally set off with a terrorist bombing and in the aftermath the characters confront the role that technology, religion and culture play in their lives. As with some characters on the show you will find yourself swept into the ""life"" in V-World. The best part of the show evolves around that. The only downside to Caprica is the character of Sister Clarice. The upside is that you can fast forward the dvd through her scenes."
4,A decent prequel to Battlestar Galactica,I was unable to watch most of this series when it originally was on air. Since it was free to Amazon Prime members it was worth watching. I enjoyed the series. If you liked Battlestar Galactica you'll probably like this series because it shows how the Cylons came into being and how they became monotheists.
2,Only ten episodes on the four disks,"Deceptive, as Amazon has designed this web page, it lists nineteen episodes. However, on four disks, they stuffed only nine episodes into what shipped in this set.The episode listing Amazon put on this page is really an Ad for their Instant Video service. Deceptive. And for someone that didn't follow the show on SyFy, lead me to wrong buying decision.What I've watched so far isn't very compelling either."
4,takes a while to get into but worth it,"this show never had a chance, it was a drama with interesting characters and a slow moving storyline. People wanted a slam bang action but this drama about the birth of the cylons was in spite of being well done not good enough for the twits out there to take the time to get into. Oh well. the only complaint I have is that this isn't the whole series but you can get that now. The picture looks great though and as good as you are going to get this on other than on blu ray. It has deleted scenes and such too. This like stargae universe got cancelled far too early."
2,This show started with such promise only to lie down and die at the end,"This show started with a good idea. However, the plot lines took forever to unfold. This coupled with Sci-Fi's (now SyFy's) choice to break the season up into 2 halves with a 10 month break led to a complete breakdown with the audience. Frankly no one cared anymore how it turned out. Had the writers known that it was going to be canceled after 18 episodes they would have most certainly picked up the plot pacing. At the very least they would have stopped persuing the dead-end known as New Cap City. Most episodes were interesting. However, this final episode was a badly mangled mess: Completely implausible plot lines convoluted by a rushed pacing and really cheesy CG graphics and modeling."
2,Disappointed,The first episode looked kind of interesting but then became like a soap opera with very little Sci-Fi and action. I have it a try for 4 more episodes and got bored. It is sad since Battlestar Gallactica was such a good show.
2,"too weird, couldn't get into it","Just too weird, I couldn't get into it, and had a hard time seeing the connection to Battlestar Galactica. Maybe I have to watch another episode?"
3,was gift,my friend seemed delighted upon recieving this gift i it came in the mail on time for there birthday :)
3,"7 episodes in, still watching, but just ""OK"" BSG followup.","I am a big BSG fan, so I was excited to hear a ""prequel"" of BSG was coming out. I definitely thought it would be interesting to see how the Cylons came into being. So we are 7 episodes in, watching weekly on SyFy channel, and I give it an ""OK,"" but reserve judgment to increase or decrease that rating later. To me, the characters aren't as compelling as in BSG. We do get to see Bill Adama as a young boy, and his father in his prime, but other than that, no other characters that will tie you back to BSG at this point.I'm definitely going to keep watching, because I am hoping it will improve, but it definitely didn't draw me in the way BSG did. I couldn't wait for the next episode of BSG to air. However, this one I TiVo and forget about. I don't even watch it live because I can wait to skip the commercials."
4,Atlas Shrugged Taken to the Extreme,"Caprica is more than just a prequel to Battlestar Galactica; it's a look at us as we slowly morally, spiritually, and politically disintegrate as a society. It dares to draw parallels to what is going on in our world today and what led up to Caprica's destruction. I was extremely disappointed that the series was cancelled and would have loved to see it play out for one more season. As it turns out, the final episode in season 1.5 was a look at what the producers had planned for the next season provided that there was to be a next season. I think it would be wise that producers stick to telling the entire story in one season and let it come to a natural end. Having shown us what was planned and then cancelling was truly a disservice to those of us who watched the series. Newvertheless, I bought both the first season andSeason 1.5 at an extremely good price. There is no Blu Ray format, but the regular DVD is superb quality."
3,"7 episodes in, it's OK. Not bad, but not great either.","I am a big BSG fan, so I was excited to hear a ""prequel"" of BSG was coming out.

5,Caprica,Great series too short and I enjoyed it so much and the arrival of the DVD was so good too. It is so good that Amazon is filled with so many good companies and people to find movies and series to watch. Great job!!
5,This isn't the whole season,"Customers buying this DVD need to be aware that this is not the entire season. It ends midway through season 1. There's more on Season 1.5. To avoid frustration, I would wait until the entire season is available on DVD."
5,NBC must pay for cancelling this show!,"For anyone and everyone who wants to know where Cylons came from, this is it. A lot of people were undoubtedly made uncomfortable by the polytheist/monotheist conflict. As a long-time student of archaeology and ancient history, I have no sympathy for them. The writers did an absolutely outstanding job of exploring the canonically-correct division existing in the Battlestar Galactica storyline and doing so in a way that supported rather than interfered with telling a very involving, often brilliantly-acted, and very moving plot."
4,good looking watch,"it is a good looking watch, however, the battery die two weeks after I bought it."
4,Southwestern Rock,"If there is an 'Arizona' sound the Sandrubies (Sidewinders) are it. Along with the Gin Blossoms, Deadhot Workshop and the Refreshments, the Sandrubies are an enjoyable live band and to see Rich Hopkins play his guitar by his ankle is truly something. This album is a great 'hits' album. The old songs really have gotten better with age."
4,Grab this while you can...,"The Sidewinders (Sand Rubies) make populist music, and I mean that in the best possible sense. They rock without insulting your intelligence, and they blast live. Fans of the Silos and early Wilco will know what I mean. The one thing many of the Tucson Bands of the 80's-90's have in common is a trace of Neil Young in their sound, including these guys. This independently released set will likely go away soon, so grab this while you can."
3,Nice Early Album,"Debutalbum from Indigo Girls. The album was re-released after the success of their selftitled second album and the single ""Closer to Fine"".It's a fine album featuring the well-known beautiful vocals of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray. Simple arrangemets dominated by their two fine acoustic guitars.There are a couple of stand-out songs like Saliers' ""Left Me a Fool"" and the cover of Chet Powers' ""Get Together"".The songwriting may not be as consistent as on their later albums, but still a nice album."
3,Early Indigo Girls!,"This was the first Indigo Girls album; recorded before the first Epic album ""Indigo Girls"". There is a very naked live-feel to most of these recordings, most of which very well may be ""undubbed first takes"" featuring only acoustic guitars and vocals. A few tracks contains additional instruments such as cello, flute and harmonica. Their song-writing at this point is not quite up to the ( very high ) level of their later albums, and the songs are generally not quite as melodic.For me two tracks stand out; Emily's great ballad ""Left Me a Fool"" and their cover of ""Get Together"", the only track to feature electric guitar."
4,Excellent reference book for newer Alexanders,"This is a terrific book with nice photos and is accurate. If you are a newer collector or a seasoned collector, this book is a great one to own!"
1,Needs a rewrite,"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book. I wanted to master purses/totes with zippers. The instructions in the book are confusing, poorly written, and incomplete. If I wasn't moderately experienced making purses and totes, I would have been completely lost.The purple tote. When you are going to attach the zipper assembly to the top of the tote, right sides together, you have to turn the bag inside out. Simple enough to do, but this instruction is left out.The princess bag...just how far from the edge of the fabric should you sew the piping?Why is the terminology not consistent? Sometimes it's backing. Sometimes it's lining.I have her other book on totes and it's excellent. I am terribly disappointed in this one!"
4,A very fun book!,"This is a very fun book for all. When I was younger I could remember my aunt teaching my sister and I the song, and I was glad when I went to the library and seen that it was a book. I think that if you get this book you will have lots of fun."
1,Down by the Bay,"Book was not in the right order. The first page was not in the book at all, instead there was a duplicated page."
2,Doesn't show the feet!,"I've got a fair bit of dance experience (although not hip-hop), but I found this video extremely hard to follow. The moves seem great, but she teaches them very quickly, and the camera often does not show her feet. Hard to follow steps just from the torso. After sticking to the lifeline a few times through and watching some bits on slow on the DVD, I'm slowly picking it up, but I'm not convinced this will ever be in frequent rotation for me."
3,barely work up a sweat,"this is ok. but don't buy it if you want to learn some dance moves for the dance floor or if you're hoping to work up a sweat. i went through the ENTIRE video (all sections) and had to modify everything to make it a workout (and even so, not that sweaty). the ""dance"" moves are more like fancied-up workout moves than real dance moves. if you're looking for a little something to get you moving, this will do it. and it's interesting. i was hoping for something more intense and more dance-like."
2,not feelin' this,"maybe i havent given it much of a chance but I dont really like this workout. The instructor is super corny. Lets just say her version of ""the salt shaker"" is like nothing you would see in a yin yang twins video. I prefer crunch workouts."
1,Not a good video,"I've taken hip-hop classes before and loved them so I bought this video to do at home. It's not good. In fact, it may be one of the worst videos I have for more than one reason. The music is bad, the moves are bad, it doesn't get my heart rate up, they don't go over the moves. I bought it because of all the positive reviews I read but now I'm starting to think the producers are writing those reveiws.I wouldn't recommend buying this video."
1,DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO,"This is my first video purchased from this instructor. I am not sure about her other videos but this one is terrible. Very hard to follow. Not for a beginner. If you are a hip hop dancer, you may catch the moves but the music is really uncool. So 90s. Don't waste your money. Really disappointing. Trying to figure out who I can give it to..."
3,"It's fun...but, not sure how effective","I found this workout to be fun, but didn't really break much of a sweat. I thought the instructor did a good job, but just didn't get the workout I had expected. I ended up selling this one on Craig's List."
5,It's fun and easy to follow,"This is my favorite exercise tape. The steps are easy to learn, and can work in smaller spaces. The music is upbeat and the instructor is not irritating....I lost 5 lbs. using this tape 3x a week in combination with other exercises..."
3,Quickfix Review,"This was an overall good DVD. Its quick, easy, and fun, but most importantly it makes you sweat!"
1,Not for the average uncoordinated person,Don't buy this DVD if you are uncoordinated since the instructor seems to expect you to know the moves before you try them out. It would be nice if they went slower through the learning phases and broke the moves down more. I tried this once and got frustrated and quit. The moves are neat but not for me.
5,Better than the Grind,"I always love dance style workouts, but have been disappointed in the past. I've pretty much given up until I happened upon the QuickFix Hip Hop on cable TV (Comcast on-demand fitness section). The workout is broken up into 3 segments... and you can do one or all of them depending on how much sweat (or time) you can afford. It's so great that I am buying the DVD after swearing off fitness videos."
1,forget it,"I was looking forward to a fun hip hop workout and to learn a new routine. The music sucks..it is more like musak and that just killed ot for me right there. The instructer does not break the moves down , there is no counting no right/ left , no real instruction at all...just ok now do this. I wanted to break this cd into pieces , but I will probably just learn the routine with my own music playing over the soundtrack."
1,Frustrating as hell.,"Unless you already are a hiphop dancer it is hopeless to follow her intructions. She has NO idea how to teach ... NONE whatsoever. She shows you a move maybe twice, full speed, not telling you which leg or arm to start on, not showing it from the back so you could mimic and then you are expected to HAVE it and she moves on.Ridiculous.A waste of money."
1,I ' m not planing on buying this dvd anytime soon.....,"I happened to see one of the segments from this dvd on Exersice TV on digtial cable. From what i saw i didn't like this workout at all !. 1st off you called this ""hip-hop"". The moves look like nothing ive seen today. Her moves are stuck in the 1980's. The music is out there too. I expected Rap music ,not techo. it didn't make sense. She also teaches way too fast. If you want people to learn you have to show us at least 3or 4 times. She shows you once and then adds more to it. I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone who's 20 like myself or older. The only people who like this dvd are people who are stuck in the 80's or maybe pre-teens. OVER ALL .... NOT A GOOD DVD. get QUICK FIX -CARDIO KICK ( KICKBOXING). THAT DVD IS MUCH BETTER."
1,No Hip Hop Music in this video,"I was disappointed in the music - it is ordinary exercise music and is definitely not of the hip hop genre. Moreover, the instructor shows you in detail real small simple steps and then quickly advances to more difficult steps with little or no chance to even watch her do it slowly let alone teach you to do them. Very disappointing."
3,Fun but Corny,I like the way the DVD is set up in 10 minute segments.The moves are not necessarily easy - I've been dancing my whole life and its taken me 3 or 4 runs to catch on to all the choreagraphy - but they are a bit cheesey...not something I would show off at the club!Its fun and a nice changeup between my other DVDs. Just don't expect to learn any super hip moves from it! But it gets my heart rate up and is a little different than my other dance DVDs.
4,hip hop easy,Her cueing is very good. A lot of repetition and pretty easy to follow. The music is also good. I like the moves.
2,"Cheesy instructor, cheesy moves, barely a workout","This is not the dvd to get if you have any dance experience at all. The moves are not cool and I found the instructor's bubbly talk annoying. The back up dancers are not anything to aspire to either. I found one of them to be such a bad dancer that it was distracting. That said, I do like the format of the dvd with each dance being 10 minutes so you can mix and match. There is also a bonus dance which I found a little more challenging. But if you are looking for a workout, I think going for a walk would be more exercise."
2,It might very well be that I'm not that coordinated,"I wouldn't exactly call it a ""quick fix"". I wanted something for a quick workout, and I liked the fact that it comes in 4 segments of 10 minutes so you can have a sort of custom workout. It's a great idea, I wish it was easier to follow. I just don't have the time that it's going to require to learn the moves. I wanted something easier so I can get going and really be able to use it to it's full potential sooner. Also, no hip-hop music in it. It has this cheese beat, that don't get me wrong, it helps me move, but it's not hip-hop."
2,Not enough break down,"She only does two repetitions of every move, so I got lost after the first two and just ended up doing the 'go-to' move for the rest of the workout.The dancers look great, but I just couldn't keep up."
2,What's a Hip Hop Video Without the Music,"I used to take hip hop classes and I was a decent if average dancer. When my instructor moved away I bought this video.1. This is a workout video. If you watch it over and over you will get the moves down but2. You may not want to watch it over and over because the music is too out of date and electronic. The instructors voice is friendly but much too sqeaky.3. The general design of the videeo is weak. The costumes are ugly, the sounds uninspiring, and the setting just generally dull. I think the quickfix idea works really well in the other videos especially kickboxing, but it does not work well for hip hop.4. Buy a workout video or take a dance class but don't waste your time and money on a boring workout video masquerading as a dance class."
3,Not so easy...,"If you're like me and you've never, EVER danced, this video is VERY difficult. I bought it based on everyone else reviews that it was easy to pick up the dance steps, but it ain't so easy. I rewatched the very first routine alone probably ten times and I still don't have it. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who wants an easy to learn, good cardio work out. You might get too frustrated to continue which is what happened to me."
2,workout tape,Not a fan of this DVD. It just was too confusing for me. The Biggest Loser tape was much better for me.
4,best one i've tried so far,"im not thrilled about working out, but i do enjoy dancing. so, i've tried different dance (with real life dance moves that can be seen in clubs, music videos, etc) work out videos. all have come up short. i felt like the routines were more aerobic and not really something i can show-off when i'm out with friends and basically never tried it again afterwards. however, i must admit i like this work out video. steps are easy enough to catch on after a few tries, but complicated enough to give you a challenge. instructor was clear with her directions and each routine is broken down into 10 minutes which gives someone like me time to catch my breath. the only reason why i didn't give it five stars is because it's only 4 routines including bonus. i wish there were more."
2,Not for me,When I make time to workout I want to feel like I worked out and I just did not feel this way with this DVD. I would not recommend this DVD.
3,Not bad for a White Girl,"This video was fun to do. The instructor definitely had some decent moves, although the outfits in this video are crazy. I like that it tells you the amount of time left in your workout. That's always an incentive for me. She breaks things down well so in the end you can pretend to be a b-girl (even though you totally aren't) and look one-third of the part. I always question when people who aren't of color try to teach dances of other ethnic communities, but if you just want to get your heart pumping and not die of boredom, this is a decent workout."
4,dance fun,"I had fun following the dance moves, and I like how it's divided into 3 ten minute segments. The instructor is very cute and easy to watch. Lots of fun for those times that you want to get a little aerobic, but not work too hard."
1,not what was expected.,i wanted more for excersise. go with jillian michaels for a better work out. goes way too fast to learn the moves.
4,Great Workout. I Couldn't Stop !!!,"I just got this DVD last week and although I agree that the steps aren't broken down very much, I decided to just focus on the first 10 minute workout the first day instead of overwhelming myself learning all 3. Believe me, it makes it a whole lot easier.I had so much fun learning the steps that 2 hours went by without me even realizing it! My advice: just keep at one section til you get it. It does look hard at first, but I've done the first section of this DVD 3 times now and I've got it pretty much mastered. It's really one of the rare instances where I actually look forward to working out. :o)"
1,hated it,The dances in this video are so corny that I lost all interest in the exercise and had to turn the tape off.
4,Not for beginners,"These are good and complex routines. It is good for experienced dancers but not for uncoordinated people. I am a good dancer and I learn routines quickly and this tape was a challenge for me but I eventually learned the routines. My only negative comment is that the instructor says the dances are from music videos; she is right. They are from music videos but from videos from the 80's. I was doing most of those dances when I was 12 ( I'm 30). So, if you are going to an 80's party and you need to learn some dances from the 80's, get this DVD!"
4,"Fun, Lightweight Dance Workout","Okay, so the moves aren't the freshest around, and you won't work up the heaviest sweat ever, but who cares? Save the hard cardio for another day, and if you want the latest moves, visit the hip club in your town. This workout (either all the routines together, or the 10-minute segments done separately) is for those times when you want to loosen up and enjoy yourself and don't really want to feel like you're working out. You do need to be quick on your feet - ten minutes is not really enough time to teach the choreography to beginners. But it's fun, sorta funky, and you can be thankful YOU'RE not the one wearing those outfits!"
4,Love the Hip-Hop workout,"I really love the Cardio Hip-Hop workout. I use it almost every day. As each section is only 10 minutes long, I can use it to warm up for my other exercises or play all three sections (actually 4 if you count the bonus workout) for a 30-40 minute cardio workout. It took me a little time to learn the dance steps, but I felt like I got a workout even while learning. I also like that you can do the dances in a smaller room (contrary to Paula Abdul's workout)."
3,Fun Little Workouts,"I wouldn't say they're very intense, but they are good warm-ups for more intense workouts. I didn't find the moves all that difficult, but I've done a lot of dance videos!"
3,Potential,"The DVD has potential, I just need the patience. She definitely doesn't break it down enough, even for people who are relatively coordinated and have a little bit of rhythm (or so I thought, until I tried this!) These are moves I would use if I landed the part of Janet Jackson's back up dancer (which will never happen) and I doubt I will ever master them enough to even provide entertainment at a reunion or wedding. If you are sick of kickboxing or lifting and don't want to sit on the couch, this is a good one to put in... just be prepared to break out a lot of your own moves! She is a fun instructor, just way too talented to teach a basic dancer like me!"
3,"All Dance, Little Workout","I enjoyed the video for the dance elements. It was fun to workout to a little hip hop and I find myself doing some of the moves around the house spontaneously. However the workout wasn't much of a workout. It's not very high-energy and I didn't sweat much.If you don't have two left-feet and just want something fun to do a low energy work-out to, this is for you. For those with left-feet, it might take you awhile to catch on but if you enjoy dance, this gives you an opportunity to learn some easy moves at your own rate."
3,More Difficult than I Expected,"I find it difficult to learn the steps. I have to watch and re-watch until I have a move down. By the time I learn the whole routine, I am bored with it and don't have the patience to learn the next routine. I also find the instructor to be obnoxious, but I think most of them are. I still give the video three stars because I kept with it longer than with any other video I have had."
4,Good workout with FUN and FUNK,"This is the only hip hop DVD I am giving a decent rating. The istructor has great energy, cute outfits, great moves. The background dancers are great. It does move fast though. But, if you are rhythmically challenged you can do it if you watch it several times. I am a dancer and I had to watch it 3 times to feel like I was moving along with the DVD. This is professional, motivating, and fun."
4,Excellent Product!,"Although it is a bit slower that my other Delorme products, TopoUSA is very fun and satisfying to use. DVD is a must since it comes on 1 disk. I have spent hours visiting places via map that I have been and places I want to go. I have check the accuracy twice with my Garmin GPS 12 and have found X, Y and Z coordinates to be at least as accurate as the GPS Device. This program is a must for anyone who loves maps, hiking or Geology/Geography. Additionally, It should be a requirement for any SAR team. This is the best [money] I have spent in quite a while. Buy one now!"
2,Not very accurate.,"I was disappointed with this software. Comparing several areas to the corresponding parts of USGS topographical maps, I found numerous errors."
3,"Very cute 3D views, but sluggish","The product is hard to use and sluggish in rendering 3D views, but the views are delightful. Despite the problems I bought one as a gift and one for myself."
2,Eh,"ill admit, im a bit of a starwars fan. I thought this game was going to be great, i had always dreamed of a star wars game that was like age of empires. And this one even uses the same game engine!!!but after playing it for about a week, it starts to get bad. The replayibility is horrible, and if you own age of empires (age of kings) you will notice that the art in star wars galactic batlegrounds apears hurried and low quality compared to age of empires age of kings. Also, it apears that the game wasent adapted for a futuristic game, it seem exsiting the first time you set a bomber on a building, just as its about to make its expected run though, it stops in mid air and procedes to drop uninspired balls of greenstuff on the target.all in all this game seems slaped together and poor use has been made of the tried and true AoE game engine, i dont recomend this game to anyone but the most avid star wars fans."
5,amazing,"best expansion in the world more civelizations more battlegrounds buy it!!!!!! if you ,don't have enough money save and ten by it!!!! (hahahaha)watever just by it trust me but make sure you have the original first"
4,Keeping the fun going.,"I thought that this was a pretty cool expansion pack for an already cool game. You get 2 more campaigns covering 14 total missions. With more units, buildings, and upgrades available, this game is getting better and better. A few of the campaigns are pretty tough, especially getting started which makes for some pretty long battles. The only real bad thing about this game and the expansion is how weak the air units are. If you have a couple of anit air turretts built, you can take out 8 or 10 air units pretty easy without losing a turrett. And for the expense of building air units, it just isn't worth it. Other than that, this is a very solid game with good graphics and some pretty awesome battles. I recommend this all RTS fans. To me, this is the best computer game based on Star Wars."
3,Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds,"While Galactic Battlegrounds gets on the right RTS road, it doesn't go the distance. In a nutshell, it feels like an AoE mod more than a stand-alone game. A few improvements to the unit AI and some tweaking of structural hit points and we just might have a solid Star Wars RTS on our hands."
4,Slash,"Great graphics, easy to use directions and setup, lots of episodes. You can create your own storyboard and set levels of difficulity."
5,This Game is........,This Game is so addicting youll love it its a master piece you can create your own scnarios and everything its one of the best games I own.
4,Review by someone who actually played the game,"I've played a few of these hunting games, including the Cabela's. Why? Because there are just so-many fighting, racing, resident evil type games, and other done to death genres you can play. It's fun and interesting. If you like stalking and sniping people in quake, then you will appreciate this. For the idiots who don't approve of killing animals, pretend the animals are humans, like in all other video games. Idiots. As far as cooperative play, it's kind of fun. It's split screen view, like Mario Kart. There's not enough games out there you can play cooperative with your friends. Graphics, I don't think I've seen a better outdoor enviorment on another PS2 game. The AI is pretty good, without the sticking points of the Cabella's games, for those who have played the games, you'll know. As far as the PC version, it's done by a different developer so comparing it is apples and oranges."
5,Best hunting game ever!,"I would not say that this game could not be better,but it is the best so far.The animals act pretty close to real life(at least deer bear and moose.)I can not say for the rest because where I live that is all we have for big game."
4,Fun Deer Hunting game,"I got this back during Christmas 2006. The game is very easy to play and lots of fun. You can choose different weapons, hunters, gear, time of day, weather, choice of vehicles or a horse, and location. Very fun game."
4,This is going to be awesome !,"This is the hunting game I have been waiting for. It will have 2 player split screen hunting so me and my dad can hunt at the same time, and I can set up hunting parties online and play with my buddies, or anyone else. Deer Hunter has always been the best series of hunting games and this one just looks amazing from the screenshots I have seen. There are actual forests in this. Most of the other games make you hunt in parks with very few trees. You can even ride a horse, and there are muzzle-loaders for old school hunters like my grandpa. I can't wait for this game !"
3,hunter,this game is good and the people who say hunting is mean and you should not kill animals is stupid and wrong if you don't kill animals how are you suppose to get food and don't say become a veggitarin.
1,you have got to be kidding...,"This game looks terrible... The sereenshots are some of the worst I have seen. Where are the animals? The deer hunter series has continuously gotten worse over the years, and this looks like it should top them off. The launch titles for the Sony Playstation games, such as SSX, or fantavision have more realistic looking environments than this ""hunting"" title does. Online play? Why would I want to play a hunting game Online with 8 other people? Are you going to race each other to bag the biggest deer? what kind of hunting sim is this? and if you're in Co-Op what does the person do who doesn't have the gun? Do you line up and choreograph your shots to hit the animal from different sides at the same time? This just seems silly.If this title were in the 9.99 bargin bin, I might consider it for a coaster. ...an Experienced and disappointed Outdoorsman"
4,I Forgot How Good She Is!,Rita Coolidge is so smooth and sexy. It's a beautiful album. Soft and intelligent. More please
3,"Lovely voice, but somewhat boring album","Rita Coolidge sounds as good as she always has. In fact, her voice has aged nicely with occasional husky tones -- aged like a fine wine. But, I was sorely disappointed in this album. I knew that Rita had interpretive skills, but it seems they weren't allowed freedom within the arrangements here, which had a tendency to sound too much the same -- almost to a droning point.Not to say that this album falls short of high points, though. Her re-working of ""We're All Alone"" is a turnabout from her hit version, making this version tantamount and one that overshadows her hit, as well as Boz Scaggs' original. Another excellent track is ""I Don't Know Enough About You,"" which shows that Rita can swing in a sultry way.I'm glad that I purchased this album, even though it didn't live up to my expectations. I still have high hopes that Rita will record another in this genre, but hopefully her arranger(s) have more variety and creativity in future arrangements."
4,And So Is Love,"On December 18th I saw Rita Coolidge at the Rams Head Tavern in Annapolis, Maryland. She did a great job and I enjoyed her in the 70's when I purchased several of her LP's. I thought her voice was better than ever. Decided to get the Christmas CD as well."
2,It Just Doesn't Gel!,"Both the sonic quality and jazz musicianship of this disc were of high caliber. As established before, Rita could sing just about any genre that is American: country, pop, hollywood soundtrack, ballad, soul... But why it didn't work with this record? One thing, Rita's voice was constantly on the flat side, even on her signature tune ""We're All Alone"". Another reason might be that most of the accompaniments were recorded earlier, and Rita's voice was added later. As such, there was little or no interaction between Rita and the studio musicians, thus dampened the overall performance of this album <----- my logical guess."
5,Rita Reigns Supreme,"Rita has done it again ... simply stunning from start to finish ! Rita's voice is the great centerpiece of this new collection of songs. Rita is truly doing things with her voice now, that she has only hinted at in the past. She sounds warm, passionate, and exhilirated by the material.Favorites are ""Cry Me A River"", Peggy Lee's "" I Don't Know Enough About You"", ""More Than You Know"". A triumph for the great, underrated Rita Coolidge. I hope Concord Records gets behind this recording, I see another Grammy award in Rita's future ! Cd packaging is beautiful, really first rate. Wow !! what a beautiful picture on the cover. The last song, ""Don't Go to Strangers "" will become a new Rita classic !! This cd is wonderful, ""And So Is Rita ""!"
5,Intriging...Suspensful,I read this book by recommendation of a friend. Best recommendation I've had in a long time. The author worked several lives with twists and turns to create a can't put down book. A murder-mystery like no other with an ending I've never read. All characters have little in common except...
3,A better personal diary than portrait of a nation,"While the author of this book did travel extensively during a pivotal time in Georgia's history (the late '80s-early /90s, just as the country was preparing to declare independence), and her observations are sometimes astute, she asserts herself very much as part of the narrative. It started to get annoyingly intrusive, especially her thoughts about feminist issues. Although I would be the first to admit that Georgia has significant problems regarding gender (even more so at the time this was published), I think Russell is unnecessarily harsh in her judgment of a developing post-soviet society by contemporary Western standards of morality. This is a good basic overview, but should definitely be taken with a grain of salt as far as datedness and the author's perspective are concerned."
2,"a good start, maybe.","this book is amaterurishly written and edited and poorly final-proofed. organization is helter skelter. biggest complaint is way too much fluff. in fact, the book is mostly fluff. very little on scoring and strategy other than the obvious qualitative stuff. hotels. how the riders get on the bus. did you really want to know the secrets of the podium girls? well there aren't any. but the writers seem to think you want to know that. maybe you do.a MUCH better source for everything technical about the Tour is in Wikipedia. save your money and shelf space and look it up."
2,Another waste,"Phil let me down, and the Tour was a lot more fun to watch than read about. A few little nuggets of info were nice, but not memorable. SHould have kept my $$."
3,Great information but with american tendency,"Just like any ""for dummies"" book, this one has a lot of value information about Tour de France, it guides the reader to understand the event and it's transcendence into sports.But there is a huge defect, it enhances Lance Armstrong career at the smallest opportunity, most of examples are related to his achievements and records. This evident tendency turns to be award now that Armstrong has been ripped of all his titles and records for his proven doping cheating.Reading it nowadays and going to a ""All mighty Armstrong"" paragraph turns to be ridiculous."
3,Unfulfilled Potential,"I have been an EWF fan from way back & remember thinking as a teenager ""I AM"" was the best album I had ever heard (at least up until then!). I have re-visited this album as I taped it from a friend back in the 90s & have been listening to it in the car. The songs are an improvement from post ""I AM"" albums setting up a great grove in your head to sing along to. What spoils it is the production with over emphasis on drum machines, keyboards & was that MC Hammer! It would be great for EWF to re-record the album in 'true' EWF style, real percussion, real horns, 'proper' vocals etc. If you are an EWF fan its probably worth a purchase second hand - at least to have in the car!"
2,Yawn City!!,"""Heritage"" contains three excellent songs-the ultra-funky""Takin' Chances"",""King Of Groove"" and ""Motor"".But unless ultra-processed,cereal aisle-like drum machines and silly rap guestscluttering the album is your idea of soul STEER CLEAR.The bands1987 release ""Touch The World"" and..oh well even 1983's commercialy disastorous ""Electric Universe"" are far more artistically successful then this.Highly dissappointing."
4,Better than average...,"I agree that this album could have done without the antics of Hammer (and Maurice was not down with that, Sony WAS), however I still LOVED IT!! The title cut an innovative effort with The boys that played well. All of the interludes were fantastic (I especially liked Soweto and Faith). But the songs that play over and over in my spirit are ""Anything you Want,"" where Maurice made love to my eardrums ever so sweetly. ""Daydreamin'"" featured the friendly duelling vocals of White and Philip Bailey, nice strings supporting along with the legendary EWF Horns... and ""Welcome,"" where Verdine does his thing on that BASS that sends chills down my spine.I own every EWF album and not a one disappoints... until they're over. This may not be one of EWF's greatest efforts, but it's one you will find yourself playing over and over if your not careful."
3,"I enjoyed the CD, and I think any loyal EWF fan will also.","Although I will admit there was a constant artificial quality to the whole album, a sort of ""old band tries something new one more time"" the more I listened to it the more I enjoyed it. There is a funky and farreaching quality to the music of EWF that tracends time, even with this album. I will admit though that rap is often easily dated because of the change in rythm styles as this type of music develops more and more, so listening to Hammer's renditions out loud where others could here these somewhat stale sounds and simplistic rythms dated me also. Sorry to be embarrased."
2,A Bad CD With Interesting Highlights!,"HERITAGE is really a bad CD with a few interesting highlights! Maurice White tried to incorporate musical styles & performers that were 'hot' at this time (M.C.Hammer, The Boys-W.T.F ??), and the group suffered with this project!! Talk about SERIOUS regrets huh?? Also, having Sly Stone as a guest (oh my!!).All in all, 'Heritage' does have it's bright moments such as 'I'm In Love', 'Anything You Want', and 'Daydreamin', but overall it had to grow on me!! The musical interludes are great (as usual), but they can't rescue the entire CD. Being a serious EWF fan, I decided to remaster 'Heritage' and include 2 BONUS TRACKS - 'Gotta Find Out' (B-Side of the single 'Heritage') & 'One World', a rare track from the 'Music Speaks Louder Than Words' benefit CD (1990, Epic). Note to EWF fans out there - If you'd like to remaster 'Heritage', consider adding these 2 Bonus Tracks. I doubt that Sony / Legacy will!Peace, SD(of 'Chakas World')"
4,Nice fun book,"This is a nice book with some fun information about saints and their days. After buying it, our family started to celebrate name days (any excuse to have a celebration). I wish it had more ideas for meals and more saint days, but the ones already in there are well done."
4,Good History and Food,As a cookbook it is pretty good but as a historical and religious book it is fantastic. I love reading through some of the recipes and learning something about my Catholic heritage as well. We have already begun incorporating some of the recipes into our religious lives.
2,incomplete at best,"There are too many gaps in this book and I find myself looking for something else to replace or complement it. For example,today is the feast day of Saint Therese the Little Flower and there is no mention of her, which is dissappointing,especially for my homeschooled daughter for whom this book was purchased. She does however very much enjoy the information in this book and would appreciate any recomendations to fill in the gaps."
4,No CD included,"well the book is great, but there just aren't the CDs for the listening. you've got to purchase them alone. could have them included like the other ones."
5,The best TV series that is not on DVD !,"The fact that this excellent series has not been produced on a DVD Set is an absolute travesty. Especially given the lack of quality and substance of some of the other TV shows that have been released in DVD Box Sets.For some reason most people missed it, which is too bad. I am willing to bet that ABC could actually re-run this series now and, if promoted decently, would have a huge hit on their hands.It would hold up extremely well and be fresh, funny and romantic, even though it is ten years old.Now we all know that scenario is not going to occur...so PLEASE whomever is in the Driver's seat here, a Relativity DVD Set would sell remarkably well if promoted correctly."
1,Low low low power,"During the three years I've owned this, I've been in an exercise and strength program. I'm in great shape now, you'll be happy to hear, but these loppers haven't improved one bit. Live saplings up to an inch were all it was capable of then, and alas, the same now. To really cripple it, try a poplar sapling, This tool can j u s t make it through a 1"" trunk, but cannot handle the bark and thin layer of wood clinging to it at the end. You have to finish the job with hand shears or a beaver.If a power lopper is what you need, there's got to be a better one, either from this maker or someone else."
4,clippity clop,These loppers definitely do the job and are easy to use. The grip on the handle is comfortable and practical and the lopping action is smooth.The blade is sharp and the colors are cool. The only possible downside is that they are a bit difficult to get into tightly packed places if your cutting something over an inch thick. Overall I am very pleased with them. The price was right and the quality is too.
3,worked well till it broke,Sharp with lots of power until the handle broke off. It was the plastic piece that ties the metal handle to the cutter. Says it has a lifetime warrentee. My next project is to see if anyone will honor it.
4,Cute,"Its pretty cute for a kid who loves a platypus. He just kinda hangs there, but it seemed to make the child happy."
5,A Valuable Study Tool for Organic Chemistry,"If you are looking to purchase this book, you have probably already heard how difficult it is to learn Organic Chemistry. However, this study guide offers lots of practice problems and explainations not found in the text book, helping you to get a better understanding of the subject."
5,correction and additions to existing review,"One small correction: Puka-Puka is *not* in French Polynesia, but in the northern group of Cook Islands (NZ).And an expansion: The author's daughter, Florence Frisbie, a.k.a. Whiskey Johnnie, a.k.a. Tiani, herself wrote two books of enduring interest on this and allied subjects: *Miss Ulysses of Puka-Puka* and *The Frisbies of the South Seas.* The former was described by her father, accurately enough for its time, as the first book ever published by a native Polynesian.Whether she is still alive I do not know. (She would be about 67.) If so, she still owes us a third book, on the historical and navigational chants of the old-timers."
4,Poetic Tragedy,"The book of Puka Puka is a great glimse of polenesain life. At the time the book was written(1929) the pacific was still viewed as a mysterious paridise. I find the life of Robert dean Frisbie much more interesting. As an American living in the cook islands,he did what many people wished the could do-leave the rat race and life on an exotic island."
4,Beautiful watch,This is a great watch. Keeps time accurately and more attractive than other watches which are pricier. I received several compliments from coworkers on this Pulsar watch. It is not very bright when trying to look up time in the dark.
4,Outside Better Than Inside,Cute pocket size padfolio.Outside leather like cover is gorgeous.Inside pocket quality not so satisfying.Still love it though!
4,Elizabethan Scarlett O'Hara,"Fascinating bio, well written,about a woman who came from obscure beginnings and turned into one of England's wealthiest women. Fans of Elizabethan history will enjoy reading about this smart, calculating woman who must have been very extraordinary for her time. A fictionalized account of her life in the romance genre is currently in paperback by Henley: A Woman of Passion...caution:explicit sex."
3,Travel like James Bond,"Ian Fleming knows what he writes about. The author of so many James Bond thrillers has filled this book with his own real-life travels. Each chapter is devoted to a different city, including such ports-of-call as Macao, Las Vegas, Hong Kong and Geneva. Exotic women, foreign locales, gambling, drinking, danger, and still more women. All can be found in Thrilling Cities. It's a shame this book is out of print. If you can find a copy, do yourself a favor and pick it up."
3,Fun but drawn out,The game itself in any mode poses a challenge for most players and groups. Although in classic mode it does seem to be slow and drawn out. I would rather have the questions in a text form on the screen vs the celeb readers. It would be especially easier to read the question than try to hear over several kids. Expect to have several hours available to play more than two people and win the game.
1,A STRUGGLE TO RATIONALIZE,Nothing more than the typical struggle to make excuses rather than following the Lamb whither so-ever He goest.
5,keepsake,"I spoiled myself with this purchase. Green Bay is my favorite team, I am proud to pull it out of my pocket when I go to pay for a purchase."
4,Great shots!!,"I'd love to see more color shots, but there's some great rare black and white pics that still make the book worth a look."
4,Creative Suite 3 is not all that sweet.,"I bought this Adobe suite to primarily learn computer graphics and page layout software. The learning curve is so steep I lost time, money, sleep and interest. Couldn't Adobe come up with a Creative Suite Light for those of us who don't or can't spend years learning how to use these software packages?"
2,"It has potential, but that's all","This could have been a good game, but there are lots of games like that. Don't waste your money, it won't work, unless you have a cray II supercomputer in your basement. It crases constantly, even if you hit Configure to try to change the specs it crashes, I gave it 2 stars for what works and for the idea. maybe the next one will work, but I wouldn't put money on it. If you have the best computer on the market and the patients and determination of a saint(not to mention a thourough knowledge of programing) go ahead and get the game, but you've been warned."
2,Idealistic book but could of went into more detail.,I found it more idealistic. Reminding you what you should teach if you are teaching an Internet class or tutoring. I was looking for more of a book to be a reminder book and going more in depth. I of course didn't find anything in this book being to useful.
1,ANOTHER JOE TUZI RIP OFF,"ONCE AGAIN,SEEN IT ALL BEFORE,THE ONLY THING NEW IS THE BEAUTIFUL 1970 HOUSTON PRESS CONFRENCE FOOTAGE, RUINED BY THE JAT PRODUCTIONS LOGO RIGHT ACROSS THE KINGS FACE!THE PRICE OF THIS DVD IS INSULTING,BUY ELVIS THRU THE YEARS,FOR ONE FORTH THE PRICE OF THIS,IT IS MUCH BETTER.TRUST ME ON THIS. TCB"
2,Nothing like the picture or what I expected,I must admit I was disappointed with the ring. Much darker than the picture. The edge of the ring was not smooth at all. Extremely light. Almost the feel and look of a ring you might get out of a bubble gum machine. Not what I expected titanium to be like.GP
5,Looks better than the picture,"I am very pleased with my purchase. Sabrina Silver offers great customer service policies. On their website, they suggest getting your ring size from a jewler as the ""ring sizer"" is not accurate. It's good advice and will save you postage when you exchange your ring for the correct size."
5,Surprised!,"I was so surprised to have the item so quickly. And when I opened it, it was just so beautiful. I gave it to my fiance, who had lost 2 rings in the past 2 months. He says he really likes the way it fits. I will keep an eye on this seller, and will buy again!"
3,It's an ok ring,"I love the design on the ring. I live in NV and everything tarnishes and fades really bad here in the desert so I was looking for a wedding band that would handle the elements. I was disappointed to see that it scratches very easily. The sides have scratches all over but the top portion is mostly clear of scratches. I agree with others that the edges are a bit sharpe but otherwise the ring is comfortable. I am keeping the ring as it's the one I was married with and I love the celtic design, but I do want to warn others that the ring scratches very easily. One of the reasons for choosing titanium was that it was suppose to be resistant to scratches...it was cover on the sides within days. I've had the ring on since 11/13. It was affordable and it will do until we can afford to upgrade. =)"
4,big maw,LOVED this ring but...did not know that for comfort fit to go 1/2 size down. I ordered a 7 which is the smallest this ring came in and had to send it back. Really wished that it came in a smaller size.
3,"Nice Ring, But Not My Favorite",Its a good ring. However it is extremely light. I like heavy rings so i didn't really care for it. It also has an edge to it that is a bit uncomfortable.
3,nicks and scratches easily,"I only wore the ring for a week and it looks like I've had it for quite a while. It has a lot of nicks and scratches and I run a daycare so it's not like it's from factory work or anything. The shipping was super fast, I love the ring, I love the fact that it doesn't turn my finger green!!! I gave it 3 stars because it nicked and scratched I think too easily, but overall I love the style of the ring and the weight of it great and again it didn't turn my finger green!! I went through 3 rings from other places and every one turned my finger green, even when it said sterling silver!"
3,Should have smoothed out the edges,"The edges of this ring like to dig into your neighboring fingers, not very comfortable. It's light and looks just like the picture otherwise."
4,Weigh it in the balance - it comes up a winner,"Some of the songs on this album are a little light-weight and unsophisticated. Others sound a bit too similar. The gems, however, make up for these drawbacks. ""The Man in the Long Black Coat"" stands out for it's guitar work, seedy atmosphere and Dylan's lurching lyrical phrasing. Some people (like me) really like ""Where Teardrops Fall"" while ""What Was It You Wanted"" is a good song although far from unique. ""Everything is Broken"" is a great romp. ""Most of the Time"" has to be the best song of the set (even though it appeared on the High Fidelity soundtrack - the same movie that showed disdain for any song used for such purposes). It's the kind of song that will crush your insides if you have someone you broke up with that hasn't been completely expunged from your heart. Overall, there's not a bad song in the bunch. Not his most ingenious work, but very enjoyable none-the-less."
5,Essential Dylan,"If you love Dylan, ""Oh Mercy"" is must have, and having Danial Lanois as producer...well, how can it get better than that? There is no weakness on this album. From ""Political World"" through to ""Shooting Star"", Dylan demonstates again why he is regarded as one of the world's great song writers and tune smiths. This albums ranks in with ""Bringing It All Back Home"" and ""Modern Times"". This is essential Dylan."
5,Great Dylan album,"Great album from Bob Dylan. Good combination of modern rock with some of his old school sensibilities. Certainly it was refreshing not to hear some of the old political stances from his previous work, now sounding old and tired. Not to mention the music is melodic and accessible. Welcome back Bob Dylan."
4,A merciful album,"In 1988,Bob Dylan joined forces with Tom Petty,Jeff Lynne,the late Roy Orbison and the late George Harrison under the name The Traveling Wilburys. Dylan powerfully delivered his vocals to TWEETER AND THE MONKEY MAN,CONGRATULATIONS,MARGARITA and DIRTY WORLD. The following year,Dylan as himself(he and his 4 fellow TW's had aliases),put out this album which is precisely 39 minutes long. The tunes I like best are RING THEM BELLS,POLITICAL WORLD and MAN IN THE LONG BLACK COAT. This album was produced by Daniel Lanois,who produced albums for U2 also. U2 recorded Dylan's composition ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER. Also Dylan sang background and played harmonica on another U2 recording,LOVE RESCUE ME. Dylan has recorded countless albums on the Columbia label since 1962."
5,Give it a chance...,"Recently got ""Oh Mercy"", listened to it 8-10 times, love it. Low-keyed, murky underwater, funked-up bluesy-sounding all-American music of love, longing, second thoughts, memories re-remembered, grim realities, loneliness, failed love, with a veneer of plain-spokenness verging on attempted good cheer.Don't let that description turn you off. You'll know what you're getting into, you'll give it five listens to hear what it's about, and you won't regret it."
5,The Maestro Does It Again,"Oh Mercy probably should be considered as Bob Dylan's best album from the 1980's. Producer Daniel Lanois gets a great sound that perfectly suits Dylan's new batch of songs, and the results are stunning. Every song on the album hits home, the band sounds awesome, and Bob's shadowy, smoky vocals create an unforgettable atmosphere. For me, the highlights are ""Everything Is Broken,"" ""Ring Them Bells,"" ""Most Of The Time,"" and ""Shooting Star."" Any Dylan fan, new or old, will find lots to like about Oh Mercy."
4,Could Have Been A Great One,"If Dylan had replaced ""When Teardrops Fall"" with ""Series of Dreams"" and ""Disease of Conceit"" with ""Dignity"", this would have been one of his best albums. Of course, if Dylan wasn't perverse and willful he wouldn't be Dylan. As it is the album's still very fine, with a few standout songs (particularly ""Man in the Long Coat""), great growly vocals and moody arrangements by Lanois."
5,OH MERCY INDEED!,"HOW DID I MISS THIS ONE? I LOVE EVERY SONG ON THIS CD. KILLER LYRICS, BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND BOB DYLAN...WHAT A COMBINATION."
2,Not so good,"I'm sorry to say it but this album just isn't up to Dylan par. With the exception of Ring Them Bells, there isn't a truly good song on the CD. Its very forced sounding and the writing is really gimmicky, as if Dylan doesn't actually have much to say so he tries to go back in time with ""Political World"" and ""Disease of Conceit"", but they just come off sounding phony. If you're a true Dylan fan, buy this album just to have it, but otherwise, you could do better with something from the 60's or 70's."
3,"When you're that prolific, *something* has to...","When I caught a whiff of this album, soon after its release, I was certain it wasnt Dylan. Yes, he'd been accused of shifts of biblical proportion before. And yes, he'd even written a couple of poor songs. But this change didnt seem to be about some kind of artistic growth or exploration. It's a paradox, magnanimous antipomp from a charismatic sinner, a strange blend of ""ye shalt not"" and ""i wished i hadnt"".Ten years later, eh... T'aint so bad. If you have a great interest in Dylan, and want to know much about his evolution, you won't want to skip this turn. But if you're happy hearing what's fully enjoyable and don't need to dip into the eccentricities of some missteps and meanders, this one's skippable."
4,How?... Why?...,Who would have expected Star Trek and X-Men to merge? The idea is so strange and just plain unexpected that I really don't know what to think!
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,This is a stupid idea No way those Star Trek guys would ever Talk to those little mutant freaks they would just set phasers to kill and blow them away. Terrible idea terrible book 2 thumbs down I can't stress this enough DO NOT READ THIS BOOK
1,Are you kidding me?,This manuscript...this *concept*...should have never left the Internet fan-fiction chat room in which it was spawned.And I say this as both a SF *and* comic book fan.
1,A Poor attempt to bring these two worlds together at best!,"I am a fan of both the X-men and Star Trek, but I must admit I am very disappointed in this book. About half way through I contemplated about not finishing it, but it was a short book and I kept telling myself it would get better. Sadly however, it did not. I found the X-men characters poorly portrayed, and did not care at all for the romance between Storm and Picard. In addition, I believe several of the characters actions, both X-men and Starfleet, to be out of character and inaccurate according to their respective story lines. Finally, I must say I was expecting a little more depth to the story line as I found it very predictable and free of any twists. About the only good things I could say about the book would have to be the camaraderie between Worf and Wolverine, and the fact that the nook was in fact short!"
4,Enjoyed the book....but wanted more background information,"I enjoyed the story line, liked the ending but I felt like I miss something. Where and when this Captain Picard and his crew meet the X-Men before this book???????"
3,The X-Men added the cowboy touch thats been missing,"If your a real sci-fi fan then you will like the way that the author has conbined comic sci-fi and sci-fi in general. The X-Men would not seen so out of place in the 24th century and there powers would not be feared. But at the same time you could not have a team like the X-Men doing battle agaisnt evil doers because the cause that brought them together is the first place (fear of their kind,) would not be as noticable in the 24th centruy."
2,"A fun ride, but too predictable.","As a supposed continuation from a Marvel Comics one-shot, the premise seemed solid. However, the story was very predictable. Though the characters of Star Trek were portrayed well, I thought that the X-men were out of character (being that I am a huge X-Men buff).The other problem I had was the choice of X-Men. Though Wolverine, Archangel and Storm are among the popular X-men, Shadowcat and Colossus are second or even third stringers making an unusual combination for Marvel's mutants. I would have rather have seen Cyclops or even Iceman.If Mr. Friedman understood the individual powers of each of the X-men, I think better situations/scenario's could have been written for them and how they would have interacted with crew of the Enterprise."
1,Not worth the Ink,"Sadly a good Idea, stolen from the Next Gen series, which was originally stolen from Dr. Who, is subjected to a unsucessful attempt to join two groups that have nothing to do with each other. While the characterizations weren't at all bad, the interactions were. Storm and Picard was forced, and Picard and Archangel was just not a good idea in the first place. But, a disapointing book was made just plain silly with Crusher's offer at the end, and it's reception by the group.Don't bother."
4,A great read,"I admit that I have not seen a lot of Star Trek TNG episodes, so I am not too familiar with all of the alien beings described in the story. And yet, that does not matter to me.What DOES matter, is that I was able to enjoy some of my favourite X-men working with the Star Trek characters that I AM familiar with.What was my most favourite part? I could picture Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Whoopi Goldberg (Guinan the bartender) when it came to discovering that Worf's favourite drink is prune juice. Truly, a priceless moment.Other reviews state that the ending is different from the comic book version. But since my chances of getting my hands on a copy of that is pretty much out of the question, I must say that also does not matter to me.It's a story worth reading. That is what matters..."
3,What were you expecting?,"I knew before reading it that this book was going to be terrible, but you know what? It's actually not. No one could ever call it a great work of fiction, but it's honestly not terrible.Of course, it probably requires that you be a fan of both TNG and X-Men, but not a crazy obsessive fan. If you used to watch Next Gen and have seen at least one of the X-Men movies or cartoons, and you liked them, you're probably not going to hate this book.The key question, really, is this: Compared with other things I could be reading, is this book worth it? Well, no, probably not. But on the other hand, it's light, easy reading... and it's not terrible."
3,"It's a pretty good story, a fun read...","I am a fan of X-Men, Star Trek, and the author, Michael Jan Friedman, so I knew I couldn't go wrong with this book. The plot is good, and the writing style is excellent, Friedman writes a lot of Star Trek and Sci-Fi/fantasy material, and he's one of the best for sure. This is one of the few books where you can experience characters from the Marvel world and the Star Trek world in the same story. It's pretty cool to read about Wolverine and Worf fighting side-by-side, and seeing the interactions of the other main characters. The only drawback is that with so many interesting characters, some of them have to take a real ""backseat"" in the book, for example, La Forge, and Data are not a major part of the story, that's the problem when there are so many characters, not all of them can contribute. I think this is a good book if you're seasoned in the genre, but if you're going to read only a couple Star Trek books, try the higher rated ones."
4,Super Reader,"A planet is having problems with people suddenly displaying superhuman abilities. Captain Picard and the rest of his motley crew on the Enterprise are sent to look into it.Luckily for the Federation people, the X-Men are doing a bit of reality hopping, and offer to lend a hand. Xhaldia is suffering a situation they are distressingly familiar with."
5,"Had this CD for years, still LOVE it","I bought this CD on a whim at the time, and it is one that I still go back to after more than 10 years now. The energy in this music lifts my mood every time that I listen to it. It is calming and soothing and yet energizing at the same time. The sound is rich and the arrangements are one of a kind."
4,Worth the money!,"The Star Trek movies were on a winning streak in the 1980's, but that winning streak ended in 1989 with Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. The film was a critical and commercial failure. An old Mad Magazine joked around that the credit 'Directed by Bill Shatner' didn't leave the 80's!The Star Trek movies started picking up the slack with 1991's Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country and 1994's Star Trek Generations. Still, the late Jerry Goldsmith wrote some stellar music for Star Trek V. The only track that hasn't aged well is a cheesy 80's pop version of 'A Moon's A Window to Heaven'. The alternate version of the song in the movie is more subtle. For a mere $7, one can own this CD."
3,ok item,"ordered this product to take to the beach to drag my big-boy 10 mos old grandson around :) did not realize it might be 'used', which was ok, only way i knew was because the original label had been removed, and sticky residu was still apparent...no biggy, its for the BEACH after all and it will WORK, and the price was great :)"
3,Great for a year and under,"This item is nicely made, sturdy and will definitely last. My daughter is 20 months old, but still in size 12-18 months so I thought this would be perfect. However, she barely fits in it, so it probably won't get too much use. Too bad since we just got over 15 inches of snow on top of 12 inches from a few days ago."
3,An OK sled for shallow snow or for pulling on ice,"The product came in great condition, the rope is long enough for me and my husband to pull (5'7"" & 5'10"" respectively), and the seat is raised and has foam to shield our 13 month son from cold. He just barely fits in it (he's 28"" and 27lbs), but it will work for this winter. The sled pulls great on little snow and ice, but becomes heavy and snow packed in deeper snow, which is why I gave it 3 stars. We live in the upper Midwest and can get quite a bit of snow in the winter, so if I could spend the money over again, I'd buy something else."
4,Great! Wish I had it sooner,I wish I got this for my daughter last year. She is now 2 and LOVES it! She totally could have used it last year at 11 months. We even let her go down a small hill in it and she was fine. Buy this sled!
4,Even second-rate TAR is better than anything else,"The Amazing Race is not just the only reality show worth watching, it is the only TV show I watch -- period. The reason? It's irresistible premise. It has everything -- nail-biting competition, dazzling worldwide travel destinations, fascinating team dynamics, villains to hiss and heroes to cheer for.All that said, the 7th season does not present TAR at its best. All the great elements are there, but they are marred somewhat by the stunt casting of Rob and Amber who, although good competitors, are clearly there only because of their dubious celebrity. How much better it would be to have season 3 with the insufferable Flo or season 6 with the heavenly Kris and Jon.Still, I'll take all the TAR I can get! Long may it race!"
4,"if you cannot afford to travel, just watch this video.",this video is a good substitute for people who cannot afford to travel. the exploits are thrilling andthe travel spots fantastic. another travel video that is worth watching is from the travel videosof samantha brown especially the one of asia travel.
3,Not one of their better seasons!,Although Amazing Race contestants are pretty diverse and that's what makes a good show. Seeing Rob and Amber had their frame from Survivor other people from other countries were more willing to help them coz of their exposure on Survivor. To me it was a big advantage and Rob and Amber didn't care!! As long as they got to the finish line. They didn't care who they stepped on.
5,"The ""Amazing"" Amazing Race","The seventh season of the Amazing Race is by far the best season of the entire show. With a likeable blend of teams, viewers will without a doubt find themselves at the edge of their seats throughout the entire race. The bonus footage and interviews also add to the incredible collection, in which you can enjoy over and over again."
5,Nobody Paints a Picture Like James McMurtry,"This is an album for people who really like depth and storytelling at its finest. While the average pop, country, or rock listener would probably be confused as to what exactly this is, it floats in that wonderful category that Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, Todd Snider, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and more recently Ryan Bingham have inhabited over the years. It's equal parts folk, rock, and country, and it is a truly unbelievable album. McMurtry's dry, simple vocal delivery perfectly matches the tales of Southwestern despair that he tells. ""Crazy Wind"" is my favorite track and one of my favorite songs of all time, but there really isn't a track you can go wrong with. He nails the quiet, folky songs and upbeat heartland blues rockers like the title track, ""Poor Lost Soul,"" and ""Painting With Numbers."" A great album for fans of anyone from Bob Dylan and Creedence Clearwater Revival to Drive-By Truckers and Hayes Carll."
5,Great,James makes great music and this is one of his best.If you like great American music you won't go wrong with this.
3,"Great album, but not my favorite McMurtry album","If you're looking for music with a little more depth, social significance, and important messages, you can't go wrong with James McMurtry. While I really like this album, this album is a little more subdued and less emotionally significant than his other work. I find that he is at his best when he has more angst, passion, or sadness about a subject, than you tend to hear in this album.If you're a fan of James McMurtry, you're going to like this album a lot. If you're just getting introduced to him and are interested, I would recommend starting with the 'Americana Master Series' album. If you're a fan of roots rock/pre-twang country, and storyteller's, you'll like this album. Just know that you shouldn't stop exploring McMurtry's discography if you're not hooked with this album - he has a ton of really great work, across his catalog."
4,"Great Plot, Good Acting",I loved Robert Wagner as Al Mundy. I liked the action and the plot. Great adventure movie
2,to much for what?,"One of the best but its $139.on [...]I bought this a few years back for $79.00 and it looked like it was transferred from vhs. There were some that were really bad and some that had the commercials on them. Copied from A&E; and some from TV land. This cover looks like another generic version, I'm sure it's not a remastered copy but if it's much better than the one I purchased then I will probably get it.If it was coming out in half seasons and dragged out for years (like Perry Mason) then we would be paying more but the worst is the wait for the next disc. Can't win"
3,I AM NOT HAPPY!,"I have been waiting for this release for years. I had already purchased bootlegs of the series and to be honest the ""digitally remastered"" set is not much better in quality than the bootlegs that I have. Having said that, the episodes are still watchable. At $99 dollars I still think that this set is over-priced."
5,Great Action Adventure,"Despite other reviews on quality, I purchased this because of the memories I had watching this as a youth. I've not watched all the DVDs yet, but those I have are great quality. If you're expecting High Definition/Blu Ray, then you'll be disappointed. The show is 45 years old and they didn't have the technology back then. To me, though, the quality has survived the decades and I don't need to see every detail on someone's face. If you loved the program then, you'll love it now. If you've never seen it before but enjoy action adventure with a liberal sprinkling of humor and good fun, then check it out. If this show were to be made today, it would be ""White Collar."""
5,it takes a thief DVD complete series,"only watched the first two dvd, The quality of the video is better then expected from reading other reviews. I missed wathing this show ,so even a fair quality whould have been ok with me . The package needed more work then the cheap presentation it was in. But all things considered i am still very happy to have it and enjoy watching the series again. this was my favorite growing up and now it can be again."
4,Al Mundy still rocks 30 years later,This pilot set the stage for the series. Excellent escapism(is that a word). I would love to own this movie on DVD not to mention the entire series. I have every episode on tape but I'm sure that the station edited them. Buy this video sight unseen. You'll love it because you'll watch it over and over. And no I don't work for Amazon.
5,Great series,"That was a great series, they have released other series on DVD that were not as popular at the time but so far not this one.I wonder what they are waiting for."
4,Awesome!!!;),"I would have rated it a 5 Star, but Season 3 Disk 4 was missing.The company did, immediately, replace the missing disk with no extra charge."
5,A superb blast from the past,I looked forward to this arriving and was not dissapointed. This series is outstanding and tv was a lot better back in the 1960's as far as originality went.
5,THIS IS GREAT.,I NEVER SAW THIS SERIES. LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE IT.I WII SHARE WITH OUR KIDS AND THEIR KIDS.THANK YOU SO MUCH..
4,great set but 1 small fault,"got this set for christmas. a great series. has a bonus disk but only an interview with robert wagner, no other surviving cast members interviewed. also an uncu pilot episode which is ok. the only fault with this series is no subtitles. and no episode commentaries or the usual dvd extra features. the coasters and film cell that comes with it is ok but it doesn't make the price worth it. if i had to buy it i probably wouldn't due to not enough in the boxed set to make it worth the price. so in short.love the show but not the xtra disk and the extra stuff that comes with it."
4,Almost Perfect,"I've been waiting for years for this TV Series to go on DVD. The DVD quality is terrific, but the packaging of the complete series is lame. Cardboard sleeves for each season and a flimsy cardboard box to hold everything. This makes it difficult to place them in my video collection like my other TV Series Collections. For the price of the set, they could have done far better than this."
1,Wait Until Another Studio Releases This Series!,E1 did such a horrible job on this series that I'll just record it off of Antenna TV and wait until another distributorreleases the series in the quality that it deserves! Shame on you E!!
1,How to Contact Eone to complain,"Too bad about the lack of quality of this set. Agree with other reviews -- ""love show"" ""bad quality DVDs.""Here is the email for Eone if you want to complain:videomarketing@e1ent.com"
2,Disappointing,"I too have waited many years to see this show on dvd. The cost was very pricey but was listed as remastered. All I can say is that if these remastered dvds, particularly season 3, actual show how the tv show looked on tv it's no wonder the show was cancelled. I had high expectations for the visual aspects of season 3 but found the quality so poor that I could hardly bring myself to watch those episodes. Since I was especially wanted to watch the season 3 episodes with Fred Astaire the fact that the quality of season 3 is so poor makes this set extremely disappointing."
2,These are poor quality but German dvd's excellent?,"Yes, the picture quality is poor. If you were able to catch some episodes on RTV, then you know what to expect. Considering the quality, a $60 list price would be more appropriate. You have to wonder what e-one had to work with, and if this is the best quality they could come up with. Interestingly enough, a review of the dvd's previously released in Germany was very good, citing ""excellent picture and sound quality"". It really makes you wonder...."
5,"A childhood, now adult, Favorite","Thank you Robert Wagner for authorizing this professional re-production. The extra stuff is fun also. Was ripped off in the past purchasing TV show recordings. I believe Mr. Wagner started his stealing on ""The Mountain"". Even though his older brother ""Spencer Tracy"" was against the idea of taking from plane crash victims. Then later on, his uncle ""David Niven"" must have taught him more in the classic ""The Pink Panther"". Finally, stealing for the U.S. government (legally?) had to be his crowning achievement.Perfect complement to my ""Mission Impossible"", ""Airwolf"", ""Knight Rider"" and ""Hogan's Heroes"" collections."
3,"NOT digital transfers, but pretty good, though disappointing.","I have been waiting more than ten years for this series to come out on DVD, but I really didn't think it would. I had bought a set of this show on DVD's from someone who duped it from Nostlagia nd some Canadian netowrk and the quality was between a 6 and 7 in quality for the most part.Now, it finally comes out on DVD two weeks ago and I have to agree with the other reviewers and say the quality is a little off. It is not what I expected, although it is watchable and not that bad. It is about an 8.5. We all thought it was going to be about a ten.Maybe there aren't available prints that are close to pristine quality, who knows.A bit of a letdown, but at least we have it out on disc now."
1,"Beware DVDMEDIASTAR ILLEGAL, POOR QUALITY, RIPPED OFF COPY O THIS","I really liked this series and thought I could get high quality dvds from the DVDMEDIASTAR link here on Amazon. Instead I got very cheap dvd-r copies with lousy sound, picture, and a very poor product overall. There are all sorts of pops, clicks, picture dropouts, and incomplete episodes. THIS COMPANY IS NOTHING BUT A PACK OF THIEVES. A junior high school student with good quality tapes could have burned superior copies of the series.BE AWARE THAT DVDMEDIASTAR IS NOTHING BUT AN INTELLECTUAL THEFT COMPANY LOCATED IN CANADA AND THAT THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF JUST AS THEY DID ME,"
2,Remaster my ...,"Have waited a long time for this to be released but Eone did such a horrible job on this series that I'll just record it off of Antenna TV. Color is washed out and obvious that it came from film. Remastered is a joke, may be digital but all the junk from film came with it including degradation. The b roll shots are fuzzy beyond belief."
1,It Takes a Thief to sell this crap.....,"Okay so I caught a bunch of It Takes a Thief on a basic cable channel and it reminded me how much I didn't like it them. They're nowhere near golden age of TV quality and are a poor man's Mission Impossible. Don't spend your money on this crap-tape it off your cable tv. It probably is just as lame in HDTV. Definitely don't spend your reverse mortgage money to buy this!!!!! Usa Network's WHITE COLLAR is a flashier depiction of this genre--semi reformed crook helps cops catch crooks....Count the toupees while watchung this clunker,,,,,,"
2,Some valid info presented,"There was some great information in the last two chapters of this book. I wish it started there! There was some valid information throughout the book, but it was presented without empathy and with a feminist twist. Mind you this review is coming from a ""feminist""... Too many specific anecdotes... No solutions are presented. No advice for the ""right"" things to look for are presented - who ISN'T a Drama King? No real answers are given - just negativity about certain types. I certainly agree with most of the opinions, but the book should have been more thorough and deeper... It had potential, with very aware and awakening ideas, but they were never opened up. I was disappointed considering I bought it after reading a great quote from it about society in O Magazine."
1,Smelly,"Although this product does result in relaxation, it smells beyond horrible (fecal matter). So if you have no sense of smell at all go for it!!!"
3,pretty good,Rosie Gaines is a talented artist.She brought her vocal style unto Prince&created a spark.this album has some solid moments but it doesn't hold up all the way through.when She hits the groove she is tight.better material overall would have highlighted Her better.She deserved to be heard in her full essence.
4,Yeah Mon!,"I bought this cd when it came out in 1996, and someone 'relieved' me of it, so I got it again through Amazon. I love,love,love this cd all over again!"
1,Motherhood!,"I just spent $15 downloading one chapter of ""Business Plans"" from the ABA website. I wanted to get some detailed information on setting up a business plan, maybe an outline & specifics. Instead, the chapter consists of 13 pages that essentially says it is a good idea to have a business plan! Duh!This review is based on only the one chapter. So maybe the rest of the book is much better. (It better be for the amount of money they are charging!)My recommendation - don't waste your money like I did!"
1,not as great as I'd hoped,"This is meant for cutting glass. I was cutting single layers, very slowly and cuts were not precise. Also, I was good about keeping the blade and reservoir filled with water and still the motor gave out with barely any use. Another glassworker I know switched to a tile saw. This saw is promoted as being useful for glass artists, but sadly it is not ""heavy duty.""at all."
1,Wrong author- not Hugo Pratt,"This book is not by Hugo Pratt. I would not have purchased it, otherwise."
2,JUNK!!!!,"I just wanted to extend my utter frustration with the RV0041 router. I spent more than $250 for this router, thinking it would be all I ever needed. Only a few months after owning it, the already LOUD internal fan started sounding like a jet engine. I contacted Linksys support and was sent a replacement through the RMA process. The unit I received worked for about a month or so now without a problem until now. It has started sounding like the other one. What piece of junk fans did they put in these things? I am getting rid of this and going with another brand. Now I am out $254, and I have to go spend money on a router."
4,Confusing but good,"It's great that the main character is a cute girly-girl (who can also fight) -it's about time! I like how you can wander around, but my problem is how the map isn't that easy to follow. It's kind of a pain and easy to get lost.However, I am going to buy this game and finish it. =)My favorites are Spyro, Ty, Dark Cloud 2, and Whiplash."
3,OK,"This game is ok. Its kind of fun to play but at the most crucial times the camera angles are awful. The controls could have been a bit tighter too. Kya's combat moves would be great if she actually did what the controls were telling her to do. The music is below average, the voice acting is pretty bad and the story line is nothing new.. The weapons aren't that good either. Considering the enemies that you come up against they could have given you a better choice of weapons but you can accomplish what you need to by using the given weapons but it takes too long and it gets tedious. Most of the time it is hard to tell where you are in the game. The map that they provide is confusing. At times the game play can be more annoying then challenging. My biggest problem with this game is the BAD camera angles. On the plus side the graphics are prety good and it's always nice to see a female as the lead character.The game is priced right at less then 20 bucks but I'd recommend renting it first."
4,"Good Video, Technical Issues","Interesting, comprehensive, and includes a good introduction to principles involved. Unfortunately there were technical problems with the video, and I was traveling and looking after my Dad, so I can't say what their follow-up would have been on replacing the video if I had found time to contact them. I tried a DVD cleaner that did not resolve the problem, which was that in one section the video sped up so much I couldn't follow along. But every part of the video I could follow provided what seemed to be a solid, understandable, logical and flowing sequence of moves. I'm familiar with other forms of Tai Chi, and this seemed to provide both a strong overview and good details. The picture quality and sound quality were good in spite of the issue mentioned."
3,Not for my bunny,I tried this food because my rabbit was refusing to eat his normal pellets. Figuring this was the more expensive better brand he'd like it. But he doesn't. He hates it. He wont really eat it unless hes starving and has nothing else. He went back to eating his cheap walmart food. lol o wells.
4,a little expensive..but good quality.,"For some reason, I thought this would just be a bag of alfalfa pellets. Perhaps I read it wrong, or maybe I just mixed up a review. Anyways, there's also some loose alfalfa hay in there too, for anyone wo's wondering. Even so, it's a good product and I think they fortified it with vitamins as well."
1,I don't hate but can't really rate it,Our rabbit died a few days after giving this to him. Not sure if the food caused it. We just found him dead one afternoon. I have always fed Houdini fresh vegestables and kaytee timothy hay before giving him this product.
2,"She's no lady, she's a Goddess!","I bought this movie because it has Rosalba Neri (aka Sara Bay). Remember, it's an early seventies spaghetti horror flick. With that in mind, enjoy for what it's worth. However, do not get the DVD produced by ""DVD Movie"". It has no features and is the 83 minute cut version, thus my 2 stars rating. I recommend that you purchase the remastered 99 minute version produced by ""A2Zcds"". You'll get to see more of Rosalba!"
3,Ok - better CDs out there,"This CD is ok. I was looking for something a bit more soothing. I prefer the Mozart Effect CDs out there instead. Not bad, just not the best."
4,Great buy...-,A great way to introduce a little one to the classics. Great for bedtime or daytime play. I enjoy it as well.
2,"You could do worse, but....","This CD was a sweet, daffy idea from the office of our former governor of Georgia, Zell Miller. And copies are still being handed out to every new parent in Georgia (including me), courtesy of Zell's successor. As a freebie, it's great, but if you're going to spend money, may I suggest that there are better choices? Anything by Elgar, Vaughan-Williams, or Mozart seems to entertain and soothe my two-month-old. Incidentally, he also enjoys Scottish folk music (although I have yet to expose him to bagpipes...). Basically, the jury's still out on whether classical music will make him more intelligent. But any exposure to music will certainly enrich his life, and any classical music will serve to introduce you and your baby to its beauty.Alas, however, this is one of the worst compilations I think I have ever heard, so if you would prefer a compilation, why not spend a few minutes checking around on Amazon for another?"
2,Not for People Already Have Lots of Classical Collections,"I thought the classical pieces in ""Build Your Baby's Brain"" was going to be played in a different way specially designed to ""build"" my baby's brain. The result is quite disappointing. The music is only slightly rearranged from its original classical version and I have almost all those pieces in my Classical CD collections. It is definitely not recommanded for those who already have lots of classical music collections."
1,A CD is just a CD...,"...But intelligence is hereditary.Doesn't bode well for the people who flocked to buy this disc to ""raise baby's IQ.""P.S.: You don't get muscles like Popeye's from eating spinach either, and there is no Tooth Fairy."
2,"It'd be nice, but it's difficult to unplug...","The case fits the iPod nicely, but I'm not sure the designers tried it out before manufacturing it. The hinges interfere with the little buttons on the side of the plug that allow it to be unplugged. Other than that MAJOR oversight, I like it..."
2,Flawed design,"I used this product for almost a year for my 60GB video iPod. Looking at it on Amazon, it looked like exactly what I wanted. However, when I got it, I found some major flaws:1. The dock connector plug is almost unusable. The dock plug fits in, but is almost impossible to get out. (The trick here is to use the lanyard to push the release buttons.)2. The earphone cutout is too small to use any third-party headphones or even Apple's own multimedia out cable. Used a Dremel to fix this.3. The latches that hold the case shut failed in less than a year, which is why I finally replaced it.That said, if you can live with flaws 1 and 2, this case does a very good job of protecting an iPod."
1,Really?,"It seems to good to be true. This product has super ratings. Is it that good? Well, Eating real food is the only safe bet. I am not sure how safe many vitamin tablets are. Is this better than a vitamin tablet. It sounds like it has natural ingredients. It is not the same as eating real food. Is there more risk of spoiling? I am not sure how safe this is but it is different than a vitamin tablet. Is it better or worse? I can only say that I lasted longer on a vitamin tablet than this. It is expensive also. But even if it is on sale at 50 percent off I would not recommend this. As for other reviewer that claim they have taken this for years and love it. I to not believe them."
3,"Not bad, but NOT the original version of the song","This album is not bad, but this is NOT the original version of the song. Look for Elmo & Patsy and you'll find the version we all know and love. This is a remade version."
5,JT PROFLEX red,"One of the most comfortable mask systems on the market. It is very easy to breathe in, and sound does not resonate for those who play on a competative level (Tournament not scenario). I personally love the thermal lenses because I live in a low humidity climate. The soft ear pieces do not fully cover my, nor many other players ears completely. So if one is new to the sport or afraid of being hit in a sensative area (just below the ears) I would not recommend this mask. They are also the only mask I have played with that I am not in a frenzy to remove after the game."
4,Great Mask.,I am going to keep this short. JT is the best. This is their top of the line model. Therefore it is the best. Any questions? [...]
5,Great single! The best release from S Club 7 so far...,"This is S Club 7's 3rd US single release. It is a great tune, sort of a bit of R&B, with the lead vocals done by Rachel. This single also contains snippets off the upcoming album ""7,"" released in the US on November 14, like ""Reach,"" ""Cross My Heart,"" ""Bring The House Down,"" and ""Best Friend."" It's really a great song and I urge everyone to go buy it!"
2,Too little!,"I was shocked when I received this ice cube maker! It is so tiny! I expected a normal sized one when I saw the picture of it. The cubes are difficult to get out of it, also. The bottom is very hard to push up. I am disappointed in this item because of the size of it and the inconvenience of trying to get each cube out!"
2,it's tiny,I was expecting something the size of a regular ice cube tray. This thing is very little. Fine for chocolate but I bought it for ice.
5,Great Venuti,"Of a significantly different style than many of his 20's and 30's recordings, this recording highlights both Venuti's technical ability and his wonderful tone and style. Though he certainly displays his ability in all of his recordings, in this one he seems to take more time with melodies and enjoy them more. ""Summertime"" for example, is excellent; slow at times, fast at times, never dull, and always beautiful. It is clear that Venuti is enjoying himself. Indeed most of the tracks are composed similarly. Tony Romano is an excellent part of these recordings-not simply accompanying Venuti. His talent and beautiful playing is highlighted, and he is an integral part of the recordings. The vocals in ""Angelina"" are wonderful, and the interview with Mr. Romano provides the listener with amusing anecdotes of the two(Venuti and Romano) It's a mixture of different styles that can be listened to over and over, without losing much of its freshness."
3,"easy to run through, then it is done","My daughter ran through this one in about 2 hours. While there are some nice facts in it to learn and a few games, once you run through it, it's essentially done. She occasionally goes back to it, but knows that there is rather little to see on the excursion part. As such, it adds to the pile of played out software. And she is only 5.Also, as with many fact-based science CD-Roms, there is hardly anything conceptual. With the exception of a few disjointed facts, evolution, pollution, and ecology - or even that life exists in a balance! - are neither introduced as concepts nor much mentioned. At five, my daughter is too young for this at a sophisticated level, but why not introduce these notions now? As it stands, she just gets disjointed facts from this rather than a taste of things to come or an enticement to dig further.That is very disappointing. Nonetheless, the images are nice, as are some of the special effects. You just can't dig very far into it."
3,Beret Comparisons,I have 7 berets in my possession so I'm comfortable with my opinion about this purchase. This model fails 2 collapse 2 the side holding its position appropriately as berets must 2 carry their fashion. My sense is the material is 2 stiff 4 its intended purpose. The style is quite contemporary but function is lacking if one wishes 2 appear in the manner berets R meant 2 B worn. C'est la vie.
5,WHY IS THIS OUT OF PRINT???,"I actually didn't buy this here, I got the exact same album on iTunes. I don't know why this, Heat Wave, Dance Party, or other Martha/Vandella albums on CD are out of print! Here, Martha has excellent remakes of Can't get used to losing you, and many other greats. If you are a rare motown collector like me, THIS IS FOR YOU!!! Buy this, even if it is used. It is a great album by a great group!!!"
4,come and get these memories,"This was Martha's first lp and to me her best.Come and get these memories was always my fav single byMartha and the Vandellas next to My baby loves me.The out standing tracks are ' To think You'd hurt me',a track in the same vain as Love makes me do foolish things.Jealous lover, a love like yours don't come knocking,also the original version of Smokey's Give him up.I can't leave out her version of Little Anthony'sTears on my pillow. A must have for Fans of this group."
5,A Must Have,"I have reviewed this album and glad to do it again.This is an excellent album."" Come and Get These Memories """" Moments to Remember """" This Why I Need You the Most ""These are gems. I turned the volume up on these numbers.Matter of fact, all of the tracks on this album are worth listening to over and over and over.You will not be disappointed !!"
5,PHYLLIS,EXCELLENT REPORT ON ART OF CAROUSEL HISTORY. THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE BEAUTIFUL. A MUST FOR THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED IN CAROUSELS AND THE SCENES BEHIND THE ACTUAL RIDE.
2,poor performance,"installed in my '97 ram sport. i expected better performance. it is possible that i got the reflex designed for the dakota p/u. tip for customers dealing with parts people. make sure they get the right part for your ride. provide them with your vehicle vin# if possible. more than once ive watched them punch in numbers in their computer and they type so fast, they can look up and pick the wrong product # and you wind up buying a part not designed for your application. the more info they have on your ride, the more accurate the product # will be for the part you need."
1,BUYER BEWARE!! Lifetime Warranty Rip-OFF,"Monroe makes these shocks and they are SUPPOSED to have the best Lifetime warranty but they don't. To me, ""Lifetime"" means that I never have to buy them again if they wear out. Most places use this definition but NOT MONROE!Most of the time you will never know that they don't honor the warranty because you don't keep your car long enough. I am one of those few people that kept the car for a long time and now my shocks are worn out again. Sorry NO WARRANTY FOR THAT! Only if they break or leak. Wearing out is not covered!!I bought my shocks at SEARS and they won't help me. I will never buy Monroe shocks again and I will never buy from Sears Auto again. I recommend that you google ""sears auto scandle"" for many hours of interresting reading!"
1,bad disc,"The disc played once, then I got the message ""dirty disc"". I tried everything to clean it and the DVD player and tried it on several different players, all with the same results. Don't have the receipt. To send back is more trouble than it's worth.Very Disappointing!"
5,and excellent film,"the film is a bit daft, but over all it is funny aswell sometimes you need to watch somthing daft to take your mind the bad things in the world i would reckomend this to a friend.it is a good film and the acting is very good also it doesn't go on for too long. it's very similar to haunted honeymoon, and high spirits."
5,Great new classic,I remember this movie from when I was a kid and wanted to share it with my own children but couldn't find it anywhere but here.It was delivered quickly and in perfect condition.Thank you
2,Disappointed,"Sometimes you remember a movie better than it was. Maybe it was my age when first viewed, or maybe my tastes have improved, but this was a little disappointing. TV movie quality."
3,"Great movie, but product has disadvantages","I've been collecting various versions of The Canterville Ghost. I even got the original story on Kindle. I really enjoy the basic story. I also have the 1996 Patrick Stewart version and the 1943 version with Robert Young.However, when I tried to watch this movie on my DVD player/recorder, I got sound, but a black screen.So, I tested it on our other DVD player (which doesn't record) and it played just fine. I hadn't noticed the blurb on the original listing that says ""This product is expected to play back in DVD Video ""play only"" devices, and may not play in other: DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives.""The other disappointing thing I found with this product is there are no subtitles or closed captioning.Other than that, this is a great story; great acting and nice filming. Just play on DVD players that play only and don't expect subtitles."
4,What a great movie!,"I also remember watching this movie as a child. Every once in a while our local TV station would play it (always on Sunday afternoon).Charles Laughton does a wonderful job as the Ghost. Robert Young and the very young Natalie Wood delight the viewers as well, thus contributing to the production of a movie that you can play for the entire family...even today!I recommend it highly!"
3,"This movie was really cute! Mystery, Humor, Ghosts & Family!","I don't remember this movie ever hitting the Theaters, but it is GREAT! There are three popular actors in it: John Gielgud as the ""Canterville Ghost""; Ted Wass as the decendent who inherits the haunted castle and his daughter, played by a very young Alyssa Milano.The American family headed by Ted Wass' character, inherits the castle and moves in. Shortly thereafter, they encounter ""The Ghost"". Alyssa Milano's character befriends the cranky old ""Ghost"" and they plot to run off Alyssa's new step mom. The story line contains several humourous scenes and also involves a mystery for Alyssa to solve. She must solve a riddle in order to help the ""Ghost"" to escape from this world and go to his eternal rest.This movie would be a great movie for children 10 and above, as well as adults looking for some lighthearted entertainment."
1,Worst Ever,"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! I don't know who these people are that are soo satified but I think they are planted reviews. This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 999.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!"
3,Nice short,"I give kudos to the filmmakers here to keeping it brief. There's nothing worse than a one-minute idea made into a five-minute drag of a film (think of the worst SNL bits you've seen). Those that have complained that this is too short aren't thinking clearly. Sure, it could have been longer, but would that make it better? The filmmakers didn't think so. With all that said, I can't rate it higher than three stars simply because it didn't do as much for me as some of the other entries.Some may say, ""Rate it by itself. Don't compare it to the others in the competition."" Folks, we rate everything compared to other things we've seen and since we're looking for a winner here, I have to compare them. I'd love to see another piece from these folks to see what they do with more content."
3,"Funny, but lame","I liked this movie, I thought it was funny, but lame. And what's with the music? There's no reason for that kind of music in this kind of movie. Kind of funny, could have been funnier."
3,a nice little comedy,"...but come on, a ten dollar budget? Maybe if you already have the camera gear AND the lighting AND the dolly AND the jib/crane for the opening shot. For most indie filmmakers these costs add up tremendously. Just be realistic in the information given so you don't sound so much the ""Blair Witch/Open Water"" no-budget darlings and have people think this short was made by just picking up a camcorder and taping something on the fly."
2,A COMERCIAL U KNOW LIEK ON TV,I THOUGHT IT WAS A SHORT FILM COMPETITION BUT THIS IS MORA LIEK A COMERCIAL U KNOW LIEK ON TV WHAN TH3Y SHOW TEH COMERCIAL DURNG SMALVIL3 LOLOL!!!!
2,Old and dull,"This concept is very old and dull , The guy somehow goes to the wrong house ? sees his neighbours in bed ,,, ending ,,,, what creative mind thought this up ?"
1,Special Ed,Are you kidding me? When this guy is driving down the street every house on the block looks different. Is he some sort of special education graduate? This movie a sad story about a some poor soul with a terrible memory problem or a man with 'special' needs not a comedy - unless it's audience is 'special' as well.
4,Laugh out loud funny,"I caught this in the original phase of the competition, and it was the only short (besides a quirky little number called ""Murder"") that made me laugh out loud. This is a terrific idea, executed perfectly, with dead-on facial expressions by the lead actor. Congratulations, Greg!Jerry WhiteWriter, ""Duel at Red Table"""
2,Nice Skit,"I can only rate this is as ""fair"" because it feels like I was robbed of a bigger payoff. This works great as a skit or a joke --- maybe I could see it as a quick segment on a show like Mad TV. But I don't feel like shorter is better for a short ""film"" unless the filmmaker can still somehow explain why this character makes this mistake. Did he have a bad day? Doesn't appear that way. Is this a cookie-cutter neighborhood? According to the establishing shot, obviously not. Is he mentally handicapped? If so, it wouldn't be funny. It was a good start (or ending), but it needs more to become a story instead of a joke. Sorry!"
2,CUTE BUT NOT FILLING,"I'M TYPING THIS VERY SLOW BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T READ VERY FAST ANYWAY. IF I SAY MORE MY REVIEW WILL BE LONGER THAN THE FILM, SOOO I WILL SIGN OFF NOW. BUT SERIOUSLY, GOOD JOB FOR THE PART THAT IS THERE."
2,Why was this made?,"Yes, it's funny. We know. But the whole premise is something that you should find WITHIN another movie. It works as a punchline on paper, but not warranting of an award-winning short film."
3,Ok,"This film is funny, but it feels to much like a comercial to me. At the end of it I was waiting for the annoucner to come on and say ""drink bud light and this won't happen to you!"" or some cheesey line like that.Sure, this is a short film competition, but this film is just too short. It would have been better if you had a longer film about a guy and one of his bad days, and ended it with the whole wrong house thing (which, just for the record, was pretty funny and clever)."
2,As seen on TV!!,Was this a commerical? Seemed to me it was an ad for maybe the USPS or maybe a mattress company about getting a good night's rest.
2,How about a beer... Bitch!,"This was a funny little short, short being the key word... I would have given it a much better rating if it had a longer plot and story, maybe like seeing more of the main guys day. Like this guy is always forgetting things and laughter ensues, Hahaha!... But instead it's a one note joke that feels like a beer or car commercial... but still enjoyable."
4,"Everyone's Nightmare, no surprise here","While it's funny and brings a smile to my face, it's not original. It does have the element of good acting and the suspense is well generated by the main character. However, it's not an original idea and also too short. They could have built it up for another minute or so, I can think of so many ways to lead up to that final scene..."
1,Original?,This was not a unique experience for me. I've heard this joke before and even though this is a short film contest I think less than two minutes is a cheap way out.
3,Nice...,"This reminded me of English humor. I liked the set up and punchline. I think the film maker really took the Short Film genre to heart. I didn't think the overall joke was funny in an original way, but amusing none the less."
2,Simple just like you wanted,Simple was what you were going for and you get it. Looks like you achieved your goal.
3,A Funny One Note,"Coming Home is a funny one note sort of film that is traditionally reserved for television commericials. In fact, one could almost hear a Geiko Announcer or Toyota or some kind of car or real estate announcement at the end even though there isn't one. The director has stated that he looks for simplicity and he got it, but it would have been very interesting if he could have pursued this idea further... The film invites itself to expansion. There is something interesting about this man, so oblivious to his -generic- surroundings that one house looks like the next house. One Bedroom is reminescent of his own bedroom. He seems just out of touch with modern reality like Tati's Mr. Hulot. He looks for simpicity in today's supposedly complex world and finds everyone else confused. But alas, all we have is Coming Home in three minutes... I laughed, but not as long as I wanted to."
2,Funny,"I think this is a very funny film, it had me cracking up. I have a hard time giving it a higher rating based on the use of only a minute and a half. The film quality and acting in this movie were great and I have no doubt that this crew will put together excellent movies in the future."
1,Heard it before,"The creator said that he dreamed this up one night, and had to make a film out of it. I've seen the exact same joke before, word for word, in a single-frame comic strip. I wish I could remember who wrote it or what it was called so that I could prove it. All I remember is that it appeared in The Big Book of New American Humor, by William Novak and Moshe Waldoks. I thought it was funny, but it would be a very big coincidence if he dreamed up the exact same joke. I apologize if I'm wrong."
3,Very Funny,"It was funny when he said,""I'm in the wrong house"". It was hilarious when he said,""Here's your mail"". Would have liked to see it extended a little perhaps. Adam Scott Boyer"
3,Short Short Short Film,"This film -I shouldn't even call it that.- .....This One Laugh clip was funny because you don't see what really happens in the end but come on 1:33, c'mon man. This deserves to be on somewhere else like albino blacksheep or atomfilms not amazon.com. Good but Short, and only one laugh = 3 Stars"
1,To Short...,"I know short and sweet sometimes seems the best way to go but this was to short. It played like one of them saturday night live bits. Not alot of style or technique went into this film, but I have to admit it did make me laugh. The film was cute, I'd like to see more from these guys. Congrats on making it this far. Next time go for broke."
2,"It made me laugh, out loud,",but wouldn't the guy realize that he was at the wrong house when he saw his name wasn't on any pieces of the mail.
5,The best from a great duo,"My music taste is varied...that being said, I do love the Indigo girls sound -- have been listening to them for too many years, from back before a CD in Athens, GA...have all of their CDS, however this particular CD is my favorite so far..."
5,A dream forever lost.....,"This film depicts the horror the people in Belgrade are living through as a result of the sensless war in the Balkans. As a result there are no winners, but everyone is a looser. Sad, but true. Watching this film, one almost feels as though they have traveled back in time, during WWII. Hatred and greed has permeated their souls and those with little values and morals left are considered crazy. Where are the Yugoslav's of yester-year? Who are these demons living there today? Watching this film, one almost feels transported to Belgrade."
3,These make my life somewhat easier.,"As caregiver for my elderly mother, dealing with her incontinence issues has been a challenge, especially at night. Having one of these liners in addition to her usual in-panty pad makes things a lot easier for both of us. I wish they were somewhat larger, but they do. Buying them in bulk is nearly always cheaper than getting them one package at a time. The Walgreen's equivalent pad is a smidge larger but is not nearly as cost-effective as getting these via subscribe and save. Also, there's the added benefit of having them delivered to your door at no extra cost."
3,Mediocre... you will get some smiles but no out-loud laughs,"As a mom of three boys and after seeing the reviews I was really excited to read this book. But I was disappointed. It's not that the book was flat out bad, but the writing style was VERY simple and elementary. While reading the book I got a few smiles, but no out loud laughs. The sense of humor through out the book was very clean and lacked good wit and humor. The humorous comments seemed forced and the author tried too hard to sound funny. Not to sound harsh -- but comments that were meant to be humors basically sounded like lame jokes. If you like clean, elementary humor, that could be sold in a church book store then you may very well like this book. However if you are looking for a great laugh out loud book with hilarious wit and humor try one of the following books:1.What's the Matter With Mommy?: Rantings of a Reluctant Stay-at-home Mom2.The Perfect Stranger: The Truth About Mothers and Nannies"
5,Awesome DVD,I think this is one of the best DVD's I have ever purchased!! I absolutely love Dimmu Borgir! They are now my new favorite band since I have watched this DVD! If you are a die hard metal fan! I recomend you to get this movie!!!
4,Endearing story of a family,"It is very common for Jews who escaped persecution in Europe and Russia to not ever want to talk about it. Ely said himself in his book it was hard to get his grandparents to enlighten him on what they went through in detail, or even to teach him Russian. So, it is any wonder his stories are short and are not explored in more detail? It's just how he grew up.Anyway, I am only halfway through the book. I borrowed it from the library. I do not want to give it back, so I just ordered a copy for me. I am enjoying it very much. Maybe it reminds me of my conversations with my grandmother, but I find Ely's recollections of his family entertaining."
3,"loud, but if you have a pilot and use the 3rd row...","It is a loud fan--I guess most are--but it works to move a air around in the rear part of our Honda Pilot which has no AC for the 3rd row. The dogs and the kids are happy to have it until we can get the temp regulated. It is open in the back, so it's not really safe for the kids to handle--I got a good clip on my finger. It also has a bolt thing that you could use to fix it in the car somewhere, but it is not applicable for our use."
1,Really!!,Advertised with a clamp base to secure with... Didn't have one. 8 foot power cord is more like 3.5 ft. Unhappy with this product. Not going to get another from BR tools.
3,Waste of time,"Yes, it was suspenseful for a while, but we've seen it all before. Just a rehash of the blond hottie gets stalked and the ending was stupid. I'd be interested in seeing what you can do if you got a bit more creative..."
4,good acting. decent film.,The acting was good; it is always tough to do a scene alone. I thought that the actress was successful in creating the tension necessary for this scene. The cinematography on the other hand was somewhat lacking in the sense of creating tension. The story line I think has a lot of potential.
2,I know what you did this fall.,"This film lured me into a genre I never watch. I get creeped out easily and therefore avoid these types of movies. With that being said, thank you for letting me off the hook with the ending. I could've walked away from that completely spooked and computer phobic but instead, you went for an ending that wouldn't scare a paranoid schizophrenic. For shame, this film has now given me the false security of a thriller that doesn't thrill. Maybe I can watch these types of movies from now on. Just as long as they continue to deviate from the psychological torture they initially tease you with, I know I'll have nothing to fear."
3,Tough to review,"I love horror movies, so I think this is awesome it's even here in the first place. But I think because I've seen so many horror movies I feel like I've seen this movie too. So...3 stars for being a horror movie, and for building up some good suspense. But for me the ending killed it...I wanted something different to happen. Nice try!"
3,Good plot and idea,"The plot and idea were very good, but the images were all so dark that you can't see much. There were large parts of the film that were so dark, it might as well have been on the radio because you couldn't see a thing. This would have rated much higher, a 4 or maybe a 5 if I could just see what was going on."
2,Too Many Holes in Story,"I give this 2 stars instead of 1 simply because of the performance of the actess. The subject matter is too dark and so is the cinematography.We have no idea who ""Richter"" is. Why does he have an agenda? How does ""Richter"" turn the computer back on after it's been unplugged? Why does the main character stay inside the house? Why no frantic searching over her shoulder and fear after the window breaks?I really feel robbed here. Seems like an exercise that was assigned to the filmmakers, and not an original idea."
3,Just a practical thought,"If this is made to be seen on a computer screen, it was too dark much of the film, dark in the ""I cant see anything"" sense. Well done, great sound."
5,Rchter's Agenda Rules!!!,"Very Clever use of new media approach to classic filmaking. Love the Actress, concept, camera angles.. and concept. Very nice delivery good luck!!! keep up the good work (...)"
2,Mediocre and Cliched,"Just another cliche, IMHO. The production was okay, but it was boring and predictable from the start. Plus, I agree that the man jumping out at the end just doesn't work."
2,And...?,"Okay, the movie was started off well. The hair down part really put me on the edge of my seat. But the protagonist! She does nothing but scream and cry! She calls her boyfriend, but not the police?! I'm all for sad ending as long as they are satisfying. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the movie needed more more character development and character resourcefulness--even if she does die or get raped or whatever in the end."
3,"Well made, but cliched","The director did an excellent job of keeping things tight and suspenseful, and though the Internet was an interesting gimmick the movie, overall, is just too reminiscent of the opening scene from ""Scream"" for me to totally recommend it. The line in which Richter tells the girl he likes her hair better down is practically identical to the one in ""Scream,"" when the killer tells Drew Barrymore he wants to see what she's wearing, or something like that. Perhaps the talented director should get a better writer. On the plus side, the lead actress was excellent, by far the best acting I've seen in the entire Amazon competition (1st and second round). She should be a professional, if she's not already."
3,A Dark & Disturbing Thriller,"Richter's Agenda is a dark and disturbing suspense thriller marred by a certain emptiness at its core. The film itself is in Black & White and underlit. This is quite effective, visually. But the thin characterization of the victim (perhaps a consequence of the short format) ruins the sequence where she is supposed to be terrified. It really has something to do with the story of her ""kinda"" boyfriend that she doesn't go into enough to make us feel for her as a person. Yet there is enough creepiness in this work to recall the dark work of David Lynch (Lost Highway) and even Mulholland Drive, I just wish there could have been more attention to the characterization of the victim- before her untimely demise."
4,Held my attention,"Really liked this ond. Its very unclear why the computer turns back on by itself, but overallI this kept me glued to the screen both times I watched it. Very suspenseful. The filmaker shows promise. Next time I would re-think showing the intruder. I don't know if I would reveal him earlyer or not at all. But this was really good for a short movie."
1,No End Game,"This short film was riveting right up until the last scene, which made no sense. So big deal, a student gets attacked. File it under 'dog bites man'. The ending leaves you flat. Change the ending to a scene in either a shrink's office or a metal hospital where the incident is all in the woman's head, she's suffering from a computer generated illness. She has been addicted to the machine and it has taken over her mind."
1,Ouch! That was bad!,"The girl was great, so she gets the award for best actress. However, this thing went wrong in the middle. It should have had the ""unknown bad guy turns out to be harmless"" theme, or some humurous twist like her roommate being in the drawer or something. Instead, she gets beat to hell in the end by some thug; too dark and worn out to be sure. Now it could serve as a great public service announcement for careful AIM useage, but this is no fun. I really was hoping for a cute twist in the end, or at least her boyfriend or someone comes in and saves the day.Bottom line, if you're going to keep making the computer turn on supernaturally, then you need to explain it with some pseudo-supernatural villian in the end. Or at least have Barney the Dinosaur burst in and sing her happy birthday!On the good side: It's definately a departure from the normal whimsical indy."
2,Intristing film,I hope the film i better than that short clip. I might want to see the whole movie to get the jist of the film.
2,"Scared, then angry.","This made me mad. I've seen so many movies with the premise of someone alone, then all of a sudden is being harassed. Scream? Halloween? Swimfan? Point is, unless there's a cool payoff or smart twist that actually explains what is happening, then it's bad and annoying. I was certainly in suspence, the feel of the movie was good. But the guy just came out of nowhere with no explanation of how he got there or why he wanted to harm her. It was a copout, and therefore, I disliked it."
1,Poor graphics,"I'm sure this would have been much better if I could see anything. The film was too dark to see anything at all, even in the few glimpses where it is obvious the director wanted you to see.The thirty seconds of darkness about 4 minutes into the room as she waited for Alex to get there clearly had something to show, but I could not see it.I am all for creative lighting but your audience should really be able to see more than a white spaghetti strap top."
1,A Winner,"Well done, great suspense, good acting,not overdone. good camera work, audio was excellent, sufficent lighting, the story had three important parts, a opening establishing shot to get audience attention, good story line, and a good conclusion.this was well thought out.Mal. StevensLos angeles, CA"
4,Agenda in the Dark,"I liked this film - the concept and follow-through was excellent as far as the story and the talent of the actress, but it was so darned dark throughout I could barely see the action. More attention should have been paid to appropriate lighting and this would have been rated 5 stars."
3,Richter's Agenda,I thought the film was very good up until the very end. The suspense was great...but it ended too predict. I thought.
2,"Been done before, numerous times.","Richter's Agenda is about a college girl who gets hit on by some Internet chat nerd and then finds out that he's been watching her all along.I've seen it all before, from the sexy female character to the ""I can see what you're doing"" element, and overall the film just comes off unbelievable, even more so than the modern day slasher horrors we are used to."
2,One Word....,"....ClicheI knew pretty much exactly what was gonna happen. Also the subject that you used has been way overdone, it's almost like you copied a film and changed little things in it. Nice try."
2,IN COLOR OR NOT,K WAS THIS MOVEI IN COLOR OR NOT B/C I R IT WAS IN COLOR AT FIRST BUT THEN IT WAS NOT AND IMM LIEK O NO WHER3 IS DA COLOR AND I JUST DO NOT G3T Y U CANOT AFORD COLOR IN UR MOVEI!11!11111!1!!!111!1 OMG WTF LOL LOL!11!!111!1! OMG LOL I WIL DONAET COLORS 2 U11111! WTF LOL YEAH MAN!1!!
1,Richter's Agenda,"The girl was too self-conscious, and the film too predictable. The tension was built up of clichéd images often seen in films noir. It needed a more subtle treatment of the girl's paranoid fears. It would have been better had she imagined she was being spied on, as in Polankski's Repulsion, so that the harsh ending would have come as a surprise, and not have been so obvious."
2,Scream re-make?,I think they must of just watched Scream 1. The beginning with Drew Barrymore. This time the killer was on the net instead of on the phone.Awesome they shot it under $100. Must have a lot of friends. Great production value.
3,Hard to see,Kept my interest but the filming was so dark that for extended periods of time I couldn't see anything.
3,Richter's Film,"I thought that the woman in this film was very good, very believable. I also thought that the director(s) did a great job of creating suspense, the only problem that I had was that the story was a slight variation on the opening of scream - been there, done that - but still very well done."
4,Terrific suspense,"As part of the competition, I've been hearing reactions about the other films as well as our own, and the comment I receive most about ""Richter's Agenda"" is that ""I'm never going to IM again."" The director does a spectacular job creating a claustrophic atmosphere, and the lead actress is without a doubt the best in all the shorts I've seen on Amazon in both competitions. You guys should be really proud of what you've accomplished here; your place in the final five is well-deserved.Jerry WhiteWriter, ""Duel at Red Table"""
4,well done,Good idea and execution (no pun intended). Nice to see a suspense film with a running time of only 7 minutes that holds your interest. Didn't really care for the ending. Maybe something a bit more Twilight Zone-ish would've been more satisfying...
2,richter's agenda,"unimaginative, dull and bland. builds no tension nor holds my attention. looks good but its a bit much to expect me read half the film."
1,Scream - Only not as good.,"When a film maker has no budget and is trying to make a name for him/herself... why oh why would you take a idea that has already been done before? sigh... I've seen this movie before - several times by different directors, in different ways, and I'm tired of it. And if she was so scared why was she sitting in a house with obviously no lights. ORIGINALITY PLEASE!"
1,"Sorry, but ick.","Ok, I feel bad writing ""ick"" but c'mon. It's a bad student film, made worse for the fact that it's 2 seconds under the maximum limit--which tells me they wanted to make it even longer!You shouldn't be able to make a film ""plodding"" in under 7 minutes, but this one managed.Sorry, I should stop--it's just not nice. But seriously. Bad plotting, sophomoric concept, no surprises at all."

The pseudo-suede wrapping makes the book appear even more special and serves as a nice Valentine's Day present for a loved one, friend, or someone who needs a mental boost.

4,"Great Price, Works, Still Skeptical","Opalescence PF 15% Teeth Whitening 8pk of Mint flavor syringes (GUARANTEED FRESH)My dentist told me about buying this product on-line otherwise I would be too skeptical. Still it bothered me because I was worried about shelf life. My product had the shelf life scratched off - which is not good. 3 Starts for that.Nonetheless, it really worked and my teeth clearly whitened up. 5 Stars for that.Would only use this occasionally - hope it really is from the company branded on it and not some China knockoff with cow urine, toxic lye or some other awful chemical in it! 1 Star for that.This would be a 5 Star rating if not for the scratched off shelf life which ratcheted up my concerns about origin or quality."
3,Teeth Whitening,"Opalescence PF 15% teeth whitening product works well. You need to have fitted trays which a dentist can do, but once you have your trays you can buy this product online at about a 50% savings over the dentist price. Make sure you follow directions. This is very easy to use. Some irritation can occur if you leave this in the mouth to long. I saw a noticeable improvement in the whiteness of my teeth."
4,i'd be ok except for all the overdubs,the reason why HAMMERFALL is nothing like the DVD live is because the DVD contains a million over-dubs. everything except for Magnus' bass is overdubbed.it's a great dvd none the less..davethemetalguy
3,Great DVD......................,"I actually loved this DVD, yes at first the doubing was a little obvious and kinda stupid, but after the second or third song I didnt even notice half the time. It was an entertaining DVD to say the least. Great songs, great live band and yes, the Bass solo was cool......(if u like the bass guitar)Overall, a good DVD, at a cheap price pick it up if you into Hammerfall, if not dont get it."
2,New Meaning to Overdubbing,"This DVD is pretty cool, and Hamerfall does have a nice stage presence with a lot of theatrical stuff.However, this DVD is 100% overdubbed. All concerts have some overdubbing here and there, but this is pretty pathetic. One dude from Iced Earth once said Hammerfall was a studio band. Needless to say, I thought he was full of it, but it turns out to be true.My brother saw them live and said it's NOTHING like the DVD.Overall, it's an OK concert, but entirely overdubbed. Be warned, if you hate overdubbing. I got it cheap and the bass solo was worth it!!"
4,"satisfied in Laurel, MD",This was the right product. I ordered it for my daughter because this is what she needed. I got rid of her mirror unattached to her dresser that kept falling down behind the dresser. So I figured she should have her own mirror and stay out of my mirror (smile). Now this works for us. It's worth buying if you are in need of one.Bevelled Oval Cheval Mirror In Oak FinishBevelled Oval Cheval Mirror In Oak Finish

4,Not recommended for older kids!,"These videos have great potential, but are geared for the very young. Toddlers will enjoy the songs, but older kids will find them too slow and lacking creativity. Unfortunately, they did not use native Spanish speakers and this is a disappointment for those who want to truly have a grasp of this beautiful language."
1,These videos would be overpriced if they were free!,"Fortunately I checked two of these videos out of the library rather than buying them, because they are absolutely the worst I've seen. Not only did they not use native Spanish speakers, so the audience does not hear correct pronunication, but some of the attempts by young children were truly painful. My five year old, who loves most learning videos and games including other Spanish language resources, was bored stiff within minutes. The $1.58 I spent to rent them at the library was completely wasted; they are definitely not worth the price to buy them!"
2,Great graphics but...,"why on earth didn't they use exclusively native speakers? Why would you model terrible pronunciation to children, who can learn to speak with no accent *if* given the opportunity? This could truly be a great product line. I strongly encourage the Brock sisters to re-make these with native Spanish speakers for all audio. But I don't want my child hearing these non-native accents."
1,Very awful accents,"The idea of the classes are great and i really like the energy of the two teaches, but they have the worst Spanish accents you could imagine. Your child will not learn Spanish fluently he or she will learn to speak it with a really bad accent. And they use as much English in the lessons as they do Spanish."
1,terrible video,We have been using various methods to introduce our twins to spanish. This video is awful. Each video is 30 min. almost 10 min are taken up by the two ladies singing a song at begin and end. My 3 1/2 year olds got nothing out of it. I thought it was a waste of money.
1,Unsound approach to learning language,"I suspect that the creators of this series of DVDs saw the commercial success of Baby Einstein and myriad other childrens' educational DVDs and decided to create their own version in Spanish, with little or no knowledge of effective second-language teaching approaches. It is clear that the creators have a poor understanding of how children absorb and learn a new language, so the way in which they present the material is ineffective. Further, there are no native speakers in the video, and even someone who does not speak Spanish can tell the accents are not correct. Very disappointing."
2,Too Repetitive,"My LO is 28 months. She loved the song in the beginning and the end, but the middle was boring. They say the same word 10 times in a row, then move to the next. I think it would have been better to say the words 3 times, then come back to it later in the video. And perhaps sing itsy bitsy spider in Spansih, so older kids recognize the familiar tune and begin to learn spanish. It might be better for a 5 or 6 month old."
1,Very disappointing,"My son loves The Magic School Bus books and videos and is very interested in the human body, so we were very excited to stumble upon this product. Unfortunately, precious little information is actually given about the way the body works. It is mostly about navigating from one place to the other and even in that regard once you get out of the digestive tract, the travel patterns don't really makes sense/provide information. Save your money!"
4,"not the best Magic School Bus, but still good","My 10 year old bought this for himself. It's not the highest quality Magic School bus CD out there, but still good. It can be a little hard to navigate for younger kids, but they still learn something. It's more like the TV show than the original books."
1,very disappointing,My fault for not noticing that the product only works on Mac OS9 and BELOW!!! So hardly useful for anyone whose bought a Mac in the last 2-3 years!
3,"Okay, but...","The information presented in this book is valuable and interesting, so far as I can tell. I have no problem with it. However, this tome is poorly edited at best. It's an English major's nightmare. If you can get past the typographical errors and obvious grammar and mechanical errors, then this might be a good buy for you. Otherwise, you might want to turn to more professionally edited literature. Also, throughout the text the author arbitrarily chooses when to cite other sources and what information should be cited. There is no index; nor is there a list of references. From where does this information come?"
1,Ye Gods,"Turgid, over written, and a mish mash of ""interesting Ideas""The author seriously needs to review what niche market there is ""traditional Witchcraft"" as the material herein is already covered elsewhere in a more ethical, efficient, and straight forward manner. Whilst I can see the need for some people to be as dark an mysterious as they can, puleeeze, this is way OTT. Surely the market for dark-childe-ov-kaos is pretty limited.For anyone interested even in the darker currents of Trad-Craft, I would not recommend this book. I consider it wasted money."
1,YOU ARE FEEDING YOUR PIGGY TOXENS!!!!!!!,"You know, this contains a poisin that could kill your poor guinea pig. It is ethoxyquin. Use oxbow cavy cuisene, my piggy loves it. I made the mistake of getting this kaytee food when i bought my guinea pig (the store cleark tricked my mom into buying it) Also, they tricked us into buying a miniature cage witch is too little."
3,Substandard Design,"Unfortunate to take a solid wood bookshelf and to design the assembly such that the unit will wobble at the slightest touch. The fiberboard backing came folded in-half. When this was unfolded, it ripped down the length. The faux wood molding on the glass door also was broken when the unit was unpacked. Definitely not worth the money."
4,A Bit Outdated but Good Reading,"This book will probably be considered outdated because it uses the Wade-Giles system instead of the Pin Yin system. Netherless, it's great reading.Tsao Yin is the great-grandfater of Chao Sue Qin, the author of one of Chinese classic literature, ""Hong Lou Mong"" (Dream of Red Chambers). This book is not just a chronicle of Tsao's life as a servant, spy and stewart of Kang Xi but it also reflectsthe society around him during that time.Professor Spence also provides some refreshing and interesting insight into the premises surrounding ""Hung Lou Meng"" and its characters.Definitely a must for enthuasists of Hong Lou Mong."
4,Everything you need to know about being & becoming a lawyer!,"Great book. Very concise and answers any questions you could possibly have about the road to, through and away from law school. Highly recommend to anyone thinking about the law. Covers every step of the way, thoguht getting a job and passing the bar. Also includes a great guide to US and Canadian law schools."
4,pre-law book,"this book is good for those who want to know about the legal field and the process of the LSATS, and financial Aid"
1,British scientists talk about their heroes,"This book is a collection of write-ups of BBC radio show programs about the heroes of British scientists. Each chapter considers a prominent scientist of the past, such as Archimedes, and then presents a synopsis of interviews and discussions with modern-day British academic scientists about the featured scientist of the past. Through the interviews, we gain an understanding of the opinions of the modern-day scientists concerning their academic heroes, mixed in with some of the facts concerning their lives and discoveries. The book is thick with opinions and philosophy compared to the amount of factual information it contains about the featured scientists. If you are interested in what modern British scientists have to say about some famous scientists of the past, then this book is for you. But if you're looking for a book where you can learn something about the famous scientists themselves or a summary of their discoveries, you should look elsewhere."
3,OOP but now re-released,"Just wanted to let everyone know that although this edition is now out of print, the exact same concert has been re-released on DVD under the title ""Classic Rock Legends: Spandau Ballet"" by Wave Imports."
5,Great Spanish book!,This is a fabulous book for reviewing all you have learned (or missed) in 3-4 years of Spanish. The book clearly explains grammar and has ample practice activities. The listening activities are a little easy but VERY worthwhile! It is important to note that ALL of the versions 1984 up until now are the same. The publisher only changed the cover. I currently use a variety of publishing years together. The inside of the book is exactly the same. The same goes for the workbook.Many pre-AP classes use this book to prepare. It used to be a university staple. You can easily find practice activities on the web since so many teachers use this book. Check Quia for some or just google it. This book is timeless because the pictures are cartoons and never go out of date. They were always kind of goofy looking but that makes it kind of funny. Buena suerte en español.
2,Not reliable,"I bought it for my laptop. However, it is not reliable. After a couple of months of usage, the wheel is broken."
3,Pretty funny. Could have been better.,"A traditional loser becomes winner tale set in the world of meter maids. I liked the musical montage in the middle, depicting how meter maids trained and worked. The music choice was fitting and I liked the visual humor; reminiscent of classic silent films.The coin toss alone is worth watching this short film. Well done.My only problem was that the musical montage went on a bit too long. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to put enough scenes in to fit the song. Some of scenes were funny, but some were just odd and out of place. The actor definitely looked the part, but he never came across as enough of a loser. I think he needed more of a struggle to make the ending that much more fulfilling. Especially with the dramatics of the coin toss, the ending almost came too easy.Still a very worthy short film."
4,Hooray!,"I really enjoyed this film. The opening sequence left alot to be desired in regard to cinematography. Small suggestion, but I think you should have chosen a different location for the opening. Too much white! It was hard to watch even on this small screen.But, that said, I think these guys did a really good job creating a fluffy little comedy with heart. I was pleasantly surprised by the special FX of the coin going into the meter. That almost makes up for the shaky beginning!This team had alot on their hands, considering the huge cast, multiple locations and set-ups. Could have done with less of the song (it's okay, but if felt like a cop-out regarding audio and storyline).Though it's not the best in the competition, these filmmakers might have a long career."
3,Felt incomplete,"This film bugged me for a little bit and I know why. At first I was into the comedy until the long music video segment bored me and the 'get the hot girl ending' wasn't smart enough to win me back. I think they should've shortened the MV segment to buy some time to develop him being a single, geek, and show him getting rejected by the same girl who he accidentally wins over at the end. That would've completed both the story and the comedy. But still, the film was fair."
5,Wonderful!!,I thought that this film was very well made & entertaining! I enjoyed it from start to finish & I know that it will make it to the festival:)
2,Creative but meatless,The ending is unexpected but the plot lacks more creativity and fun. Great effort!Jorge
2,Nice casting some execution problems!,"This little diddy of a flick is wonderfully casted yet has more akward moments than smooth. The effect is a funny premise that is wholly predictable and dissapointing. One flashback scence is almost painful. Yet, some decent camera work involving a quarter leads to some redemption."
2,Cute sums it up.,"Rather pointless. Film starts with statements about how many people receive parking tickets and also the number alledgedly unpaid and proceeds to follow the day of one usless meter ""maid"" who would rather save the world by putting quarters in expired meters. O.K. Did he save me? Again, cute but no prize."
3,Cute,I liked the acting. Cute storyline. Film quality and editing left some to be desired but overall I found it entertaining.
4,struck by a SMOOTH CRIMINAL!!!,"The movie started off weak and then really picked up, the part where everyone is sitting around the table was so unfunny it was painful. But after that I was cracking up the whole time... And is it just me or did that part at the end with the coin flying into the meter seem inspired by one of the best films of all time ""Michael Jackson, MOONWALKER!"""
2,Napolean Dud,"A ""Dynamite"" film? Nope, it was a firecracker dud. Too reminiscent of Napolean Dynamite with the geek, the hair, the absence of real speech... just not a funny as the hollywood original. Super Troopers meets Napolean Dynamite gone bad."
2,got start then starting lacking,"The film was off to a good start, but then I felt like I needed to fast forward to the end. Didn't keep my attention."
4,Check your parking meter!,"It's hilarious and although it doesn't look as well made as the other films it sure made me crack up! I guess I can relate with the Parking Enforcement Department, being that I used to be a Parking Enforcer at my local university. We did train our rear ends off! And believe it or not we were all on a quest to give out the most parking tickets that we could. We were awarded plaques of honor if we gave out the most tickets possible. This movie is silly in a home-video kind of way. It looks more like a music or recruitment video instead of a film but, it shows you life through the point-of-view or perspective of the hated ""meter maid."""
5,We can all relate,This film represents how most of us view rent-a-cops. We all have getting tickets and know how those few tough cops can be. I know I've been ticketed while sitting inside my car. I love this video.
2,"good premise, poor execution","Perhaps it was my computer, but the screen appeared as this tiny, little letter box around this massive sea of black. Made viewing the film very difficult, and as a result points were deducted."
2,Meter Maids,While this is suppose to be like a comedy. I don't find it very commical. It just missing something.
2,"Tries hard, and good production, but not actually funny","I appreciated how hard this one tried: I especially liked the effects shot with the coin and the meter.The lead acting was good (and the lead had a great face for the role), but the pacing was off and the film just wasn't particularly funny. I suspect that if the filmmaker had a a really tight script from someone else s/he would be able to come up with something really great, because the visuals were pretty good and most of the shots were well done. But overall, I thought this was overly long and didn't quite do much for me. Editing it down a few minutes might have brought the pacing up to a level that would have made this a winner."
2,STU-PID!,"I was more concerned with watching the clock and finding out how many more minutes are left to the end of this very trite, predictable and boring short. There's nothing wow, clever, intriguing or earth shattering about this, and no laughs or chuckles for me. So what's the point?"
1,Sorry,"I just found this really, really boring. I usually like stupid comedies, but this didn't work for me. I didn't like Napoleon Dynamite which this seemed like. Sorry."
2,Interesting premise,"Why did it end so abruptly w/o resolve? Did he run out of time or could he not think of an ending? Did the flunky get the one ticket written credited or did the gal that tore it up negate it? That isn't plausible in real life. Anyway, I felt cheated out of a plausible ending or was 6'58"" not the whole movie. The premise, storyline, lighting, camera angles and shots were interesting that I saw."
1,Pathetic,"I really don't know how to describe my detest for this film. How could this be in the top 5 finalists? It's absolutely stupid and pointless. There are much better films out there who deserve the position of top finalists, yet this doesn't even come close to the 2 star category.Cheap editing, acting, directing. The only part that is worth mentioning is the good use of special effects (in the coin scene). That is the highlight of the film, yet it fails to save this piece of rubbish from mediocrisy."
4,Good luck!,"You've done a great job creating a likeable character, and a cheerful, light atmosphere. The opening shot is a real attention grabber, too. I can't wait to meet you guys at the screening so I can ask how you did the whole coin special effect thing (I'm sadly ignorant when it comes to these matters). Well done!Jerry WhiteWriter, ""Duel at Red Table"""
3,Nice shot,Loved the quarter saving the day. That was a heck of a shot. This was shot very well and very nice attraction between the leads. Would've liked to see the story built a little more rather than such a long peice of music. Adam Scott Boyer
3,"Sad, Sad Day",I was quick-bored while watching Meter Maids. I clicked it off after 41/2 minutes. I have no idea how long the actual film was. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who had to pay to see it.
3,Brave review,If I was to rate you on aesthetics it would of been outstanding. I think the pacing on the edit could of been a bit tighter. Great conflict and resolution.
5,To know her is to love her! She's the best!,"Living in Branson we see her frequently and she gets better and better. Her personality and loving attitude come through on every song, including her smash hit The Teddy Bear song. You should hear her gospel music including He's Alive!"
1,due south 4th season,"this is really a duplicate of season 3.I feel like I wasted money. the big problem with amazon is the monumental lack of description. it has caused me now, not to order. another example is the Hot Pot, I ordered a Rival but got a Sunbeam, even thought it works, its not fair. How would you feel"
5,The 4th Season does not Disappoint,"The dialogue, humor and interplay between the characters has not lost anything over time. This will provide hours of enertainment."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Based on others' reviews, & the whole build up of the program?- I was expecting something more. Maybe the problem was that- expectations. Very sweet, perhaps just felt a bit too contrived? Maybe your little one will enjoy, the messages are positive, just didn't click for us & my expectations."
1,I Regret the Purchase,"LISTEN WELL:It is difficult enough to motivate children to speak properly; I will NEVER show my child a video that includes such poor grammar as ""Do you listen GOOD, like Sweet Pea?"""
5,Great speakers,In stalled them in a dodge pickup running them on a pioneer deck and they sound great. One of the best sets of 6x9 I ever installed. My sub distorts before they do.
2,Wheres the BASS?,Sorry to say it but the bass is nowhere to be found. Highs and mids are great and can handle almost any volume. But to be honest my stock speakers on my 2009 challenger are way above these. Ill be returning these and purchasing the polk audio line up heard nothing but great things about them.
4,A barely good indie rock album which doesn't seem to try hard enough - still a satisfying album - good background music,"Holopaw's ""Quit +/or Fight"" doesn't seem like it's trying all that hard. You can tell the band has potential and that if they put in a little more energy that the album would've been pretty good. Like John Orth perfectly depicts, however, the band seems ""timid"" (Orth sings in a timid voice). Lyrically you can't really tell what he's saying, and musically it's pretty standard stuff. Thankfully all of the songs are decent, which helps things. The reason I'm giving this ""4"" stars instead of ""3"" is that it makes some pretty good background or relaxing music. None of the songs ""wow"" you, though. Indie rock fans might like this I suppose. Slightly recommended.Highlights include:the entire album is pretty decent"
1,Quit,"Apparently when in the face of danger, Holopaw choose to quit rather than fight. What inspires this stuff? There is no emotion, heart or soul here. Why bother?"
5,Far Beyond Excellent,"I have a CD set from a date in England from this same tour. I have been buying and collecting music as a huge music fanatic since The Police's Syncronicity was new. Saying this, after listening to these live Dead Can Dance CD's from the 2005 tour, almost all of the rest of my record collection almost seems trivial. That's how beyond amazing these CD's are.The live recording here seems like it is on the leading edge of techincial capacity.Even if you hate Dead Can Dance, this will blow your mind. Just imagine how a fan would feel."
5,Feed your curiousity,"The recording is a historic treasure that gives the listener a glimpse into an era of artists who roamed amongst Liszt, Chopin, Brahms, and other greats of the time. They bring with them a history & style only spoken of as legends in books. Vladimir De Pachmann was a great pianist and there are numerous stories about his eccentric tendancies such as talking to the audience during performances, starting songs over when mistakes were made, etc. However don't be fooled, his musicianship reflects one of the greatest pianists. The liner notes are comprehensive."
4,Ok,"I just got this CD 2 years ago and it is pretty good the reason why I got this cd because of the then club banger Oh Yeah, good song the album is pretty good a lot of samples in this one."
2,Fun for Mary-Kate and Ashley!,"Mary-Kate and Ashley stuff is very boring. This book, however, was one of more fun books, that's why I gave it 2 stars. I wouldn't give much Mary-Kate and Ashley stuff 5 stars, it any of the products 5 stars! In this book, the Olsen Twin's friend, Patty's grandmother's beloved cat disappears. Can the Olsen twins find the cat? This book has a twist to it that you'll never believe!"
3,If you like REO you'll like it,"This album seems to get trashed more than any other REO album ... but it's not that bad. I really do not think they strayed too much from the formula that made them successful in the late 70's and early 80's. I would bet if this album was released in 82,83 it would have been some semblace of a hit. Basically what happened to REO was MTV and top 40 radio stopped playing anything but the ""old stuff"" (mtv stopped altogether in 85) which turned them into a dinosaur band."
5,Outstanding: REO at their best!,"This is the finest REO Speedwagon album ever produced. There are rocking tunes like ""Live It Up,"" ""Love to Hate,"" and ""Go For Broke,"" and wonderful ballads like ""The Heart Survives,"" ""Half Way,"" and ""Can't Lie To My Heart."" Dave Amato, Bryan Hitt, and Jesse Harms add an incredible spectrum of musical tallent to the existing quality delivered by Kevin Cronin, Neal Doughty, and Bruce Hall.Note: ""Go For Broke"" was to be in the movie ""Days of Thunder"" but was wrongfully dropped by the movie producers. Listen to this song and think of how great it would have fit into that movie."
1,REO lost direction,"REO seemed to lose direction with the release of the ""chicken' album as some call it. There were a few good songs, but nothing like the past. The line up change did effect REO creatively at this point, but the new line up did get better. While the album was very disappointing, I saw REO on this tour and they ROCKED THE HOUSE down! They played ""Live It Up"" and ""Like A Rock"", other than that they stayed with the classics. This CD was a transitional CD for REO and it is evident with the poor quality of the songs, except the two listed above."
2,Main ingrediant missing!,"Without Gary Richrath, REO Speedwagon's engine is dead in spirit. Even though the songs on this album are great to listen to on a nice, sunny day; without Gary Richrath's unique style of hammering on the guitar, and giving one a sense of power, the group's spirit has been squashed. I would buy this album, but would come away only half full."
2,"Nice looking, arrived with dead battery","Nice looking watch, albeit a little bit more chunky than the pictures implied. More seriously, it arrived nonfunctional. It turned out that it was just a dead battery, but that forced me to pay another 25% to the price of this admittedly inexpensive watch just to get it to work as advertised."
3,"Great, if you get one that works!","Like another reviewer, I much prefer the HP memorabilia that is based on the books rather than the movies, so I loved this watch on sight. However, I'm on my second one from Amazon, and both times I received a watch that would not keep time straight from the box, even after replacing the battery. This time Amazon refused to replace it, stating that there were ""widespread problems"" with this item. So, be aware that while this is a great looking watch, you may be paying for a bracelet rather than a time-keeping instrument."
5,Anyone know where to buy this watch still?,"I saw this watch on a lady's wrist about 6 months ago and decided that I wanted one, but it seems to be completely discontinued! Does anyone know where it's possible to still buy the Weasley grandfather clock wristwatch?"
4,"At first I didn't like it, but now I love it!","I got the watch soooo cheap that it was hard to pass up. But then I got it, and it was to big for my danty wrist. I just started to wear it, now I love it! It is so cool that I have a watch that was Harry Potter made! (I know it's not Harry Potter made, but I can imagine it is!)"
5,Great stuff for my dog's alpo farts,"I got tired of taking my dogs in my car during the summer, only to have to roll down the windows and allow the a/c cooled air escape because one or more of my three dogs had such bad smelling flatus, I couldn't stand it. Add to that, they would even stink up our large master bedroom at night! I have used the Gold Seal Sea Meal additive for one of the dogs with allergies, and had such a positive experience, I figured that I should give D-Zyne by Gold Seal a chance. I found that the review on July 31, 2011 by Melissa (Gainesville, GA), the most helpful. Only giving it to them once per day (mixed in their food) works perfectly, as the container is only 8 ounces, a tad bit expensive, but well worth having to drive down the road with a car smelling like fart in the middle of the summer!"
1,my cats wouldn't eat it,My cats didn't like the taste and refused to eat it. I even tried putting it in a gel cap but it didn't seem to help my IBD cat with her soft stool.
3,This is the one,"I originally gave a mixed review of the Capitol Years (import) boxset out of frustration at the conflicting information and opinions about this and other boxsets from the Capitol catalog. I've since done a lot of reading at the forum for Sinatra fans, [...], and I've heard the set for myself. This is indeed the holy grail of Sinatra's Capitol recordings.The sound on this set is terrific. More alive than the early CD's from Capitol, yet not the over-processed, artificially fattened sound of the late 90's CDs, including the 2nd Concepts boxset.Your ears may vary, but most Sinatra fans select this import as the best treatment available of Sinatra's Capitol recordings."
2,Not Enough,"I don't have much history with Indigo Girls, just hearing and loving a few songs here and there over the years. I write songs and appreciated some of their especially well-crafted songs. This CD did almost nothing for me. I lived with it and listened to it for a couple of weeks and then gave it away."
5,best harmony ever.,"Great upbeat song: ""Hammer and a Nail"". Sweet, melodic song: ""Southland in the Springtime."" Overall, this is an *amazing* album. By this point in their career, the Indigo Girls have perfected their characteristic harmonies. They are writing expressive, musically interesting songs. The album also has several guest artists singing backup, including Mary Chapin Carpenter and Michelle Malone."
2,same old thing: run through and it's done,"I was very disappointed by this software. My daughter, at 5 on the young end of the age scale for this package, did virtually everything in it in just a few hours (three sessions). We now add it to the pile CD-Rom ""run throughs"": she may occasionally pick it up, but its originality is essentially exhausted. While there are some nice features in it - graphics, sounds, info - they are very very light. For what there is of it, the content is not bad.Also, iMac users beware: every time we put it on, it screws up our screen - blanks out other applications, eventually freezing it in strange colors - and we have to reboot to play anything else. It also refuses to ""eject"" from normal commands and so we have to manually pull it out."
5,Good pop music,"Good pop music with a well educated singing voice. Pia is a strong singer, which some want to ignore because of all the gossip. Here she sings pop tunes by high class producers/writers such as Narrada Michael Walden. Very nice is ""Kady"", dedicated to her daughter."
3,She's Better Than Given Credit,"I can't say I am a huge Pia fan, but I can't dismiss her either. I think she has a good voice when given the standards on Pia & Phil or I Am What I Am. However, she doesn't have the voice for all pop songs which is her downfall. Producers have tried to make her a rocker (Rock It Out), a pop star (The Clapping Song), and a high enery dance performer (Dance Out Of My Head). I think she is best suited for adult contemporary style music. Had great producers of that style of music such as Barry Manilow (who resurrected Dionne Warwick's career) or David Foster to name a few had worked with her, she would have had the success she deserved."
5,A SUSPENSE NOVEL THAT WILL KEEP YOU RIVETED,"This is Robert Aiello's second Grant Montgomery thriller and his best. The story is compelling with an old flame reentering Grant's life. He becomes ensnared in the murder of his old friend and must face a sadistic criminal with an old score to settle. Forbidden romance, bloodshed, poison and a body that shouldn't stay buried confront Grant as he races against time to unlock a dark secret, only to face a deadly double threat. This is one suspense novel that will keep you reading into the wee hours of the morning. Don't pass this one up."
4,Good GTA Game,"I thought this game was pretty cool.I thought the missions were really fun,and I loved the storyline too.I would say this is better than GTA 3,but Vice City will always be my favorite.If you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto and you've never played this one before,it's worth checking out."
3,better than vice city stories,Okay this is a much better GTA game than Vice Stories. In this game your more of the iTALIAN gangsta. Hopefully this game is better to others too.
5,Great Game,This a great game and a must have for fans of the gta series. taking a trip back to liberty city with updated gameplay is allot of fun. This is definitely a good game to hold you over until GTA4 if you have not played it yet. Well worth $20.
2,As soon as the fun starts its over,This is like making a Ring 2 just because the last one is a hit doesn't mean make more this is pretty much driving a dead horse in the ground
1,Would NOT recommend,I recently rented this game because i thought it looked fun. i am 14 years old. when i started playing it i was very disapointed. i was hoping for it to be as good as/better than san andreas but it is terrible. it is pretty much a remake of GTA 3. i hope this helped you.
2,Just wait till GTA 4,"This game is a step backwards. I bought it because it was only $20, and I didn't want to pay for shipping on my Gnarls Barkley CD. I got it, turned it on, got 3 stars, ran my car off a bridge, jumped...and drowned. Ugh, back to the bad old days. Bear in mind this is a game designed for PSP, not PS2. The graphics are worse than the trilogy, marginally.The main problem for me is that this game didn't have The Magic. I've already seen this map, and I know these characters. I'm waiting for GTA 4.One filan caveat, my rating of this game is based only on the GTA series. If you wish to compare it to other games, add one point."
3,The same game as GTA 3,"Your back in liberty City (just like GTA 3) you cant fly, swim, clime (just like GTA 3) No graphics upgrade. No airplanes. Glitches like crazy. Same as PSP.But if your looking for a game to just play and have fun and enjoy the intresting/funny/good story line than get this.20 bucks cant go wrong."
4,Only for the hardcore,This game is good for its price but only for hardcore fans! - Its sad to see that you cant swim in this game (and you can in the others) the game is great graphically and musically but if you are new to the GTA series then i suggest you get San Andreas first!
4,pretty good game,"this grand theft auto is very fun like all the others i have played.i have beaten this game and i have 100% game completion on on it.if your a grand theft auto fanatic i recomend you get this.the graphics look identical to san andreas witch i have and beaten 100%.you get to the same thing as you would get to do in any grand theft auto except there is different stunts,missions,and people.i am a grasnd theft auto fan and have loved these type of games if you love grand theft auto games get this you won,t regret it."
4,GTA 3 On Steroids,"Its a great game for GTA fans. Its fun to play in an old city, like the one in GTA3, except with new missions, cars, motorcycles, weapons, secrets, and missions. The map has only minor changes, and its very cool. The only issue is i have to turn the brightness up all the way when i play this game, its pretty dark."
3,A little disapointed,"I played GTA SanAndreas before I got Liberty city . SanAndreas has better graphics , sound effects , & etc . I thought Liberty City would be better since it came out later than SanAndreas . What happened ?"
2,"PSP Version to PS2 platform, beware...","Two star game, five star fun? How does that work? Now, to begin, the ONLY reason I'm giving this game two stars is because it is warning to people who have NO clue (like I didn't) what this game is. I was at the store looking to buy San Andreas, but they didn't have it, so I opted for this one title, now, don't get me wrong, this is still GTA material, but, this (and Vice City Stories) is a remake of the PSP version into the PS2 version, which, to me, it doesn't quite work. The fun is still there but the graphics aren't as good and the movement aren't as crip, which, after playing Vice City I had raised the bar high for GTA. Like I said, this game isn't bad IF you know what you're buying, but if you don't have a clue, I'd suggest you rent it first to see what you're getting."
3,Grand Theft Auto Recycled,"I was under the impression this game was made strictly for the PSP system, so I was caught off guard when I saw it for the PS2 at the local Blockbuster. The gameplay reflects GTA III; no climbing, swimming, eating, working out, etc. The city itself is the same one from GTA III. The graphics also feel dated, but the gameplay is still enjoyable. This is more of a filler game until the next all-new Grand Theft title hits the shelves sometime this Christmas I presume. At 20 bucks though, you can't go wrong."
3,"good, but not worth it","I've played this game but it's not as good as the other GTA games, I gotta admit. No airplanes, helicopters, swimming or climbing. The graphics aren't the best, but the intro music is nice. Since these days you could get San Andreas or Vice City for about 20 bucks, I would say that's a better choice because San Andreas is pretty good game. Airplanes, swimming, climbing, and much much more than liberty city stories. But that's just my opinion."
3,i think its liberty city i hate.,This is a tie for the worst gta game. the other being gta 3. i think its just liberty city i hate
3,A Small Let Down,I was atually going to buy a PSP so i could play this game. I got to save myself $250 now. I Know that this game is based in Liberty City. But I was hopeing for better graphics. The Graphics are after VC (becuase the car engines have more detail in them) but before SA (becuase the car engines don't have as much detail in them. I still think that the GTA series is the best game series out there. I just wish it had better graphics.
2,"Sorry guys, couldn't get into it.","Man, I thought Messhuggah was complex, sheesh!! Here is the question: is it possible to be too progressive and technical? I wanted to like this album, I tried very hard to like it even, but in the end just couldn't. This is obviously not for everyone. If you like prog metal that is a bit more palatable check out Symphony X, no disrespect to those who enjoyed this album at all, it was just far too challenging for me."
5,I Love This Book!,This is one of the best books I've read about steroids. And I have read a lot of them. Jeff Summers has a way of writting that makes it so fun and easy to read and understand. Plus there are a ton of personal stories that really separate it from the other books on the subject. It is truly a wealth of honest and truthful information from one of the most stand up guys in the industry. I learned a lot more than I ever expected!
1,overpriced junk,How could anyone charge $60 for this? It's filled with a bunch of outdated info culled from the Internet. You can get all this info and much more for free from the Net. Don't waste your money on this book.
2,Very average for the price,"Comparedto other literature on Anabolic steroids i thought this book was over-priced,and the writing style targetted towards the lowest common denominator of reader. For the money, a much better buy would be Anabolics 2002 by Bill Llewellyn."
5,Steroids 101 has raised the bar!,"I have just about every steroid book ever published including Anabolics 2000, WAR, PHE, and the Steroid Bible. This book is by far the best one yet! All the past books seem to have the same information just regurgitated, but Steroids 101 is a totally different book with new and accurate information. I don't know if anyone can beat this one."
1,Good For Newbies,"I hate to say it but the book is not as good as it looks. 400 pages with not much information in it. For [the money] i'd rather go to forum and learn about steroid, it is much better that way. This book is definitely for newbies but not at this price."
5,Huge Book!,"Good book overall with a lot of pages and a bunch of pictures. Good diagrams and well explained information. I have learned a lot by reading this book, especially how to avoid side effects and stay away from fake steroids, a big problem nowadays. Thanks for the great book!"
5,Good Book!,I cant imagine how anyone could read this book and walk away without learning some valuable lessons. It is a very exciting book that covers many topics. I am happy I got it. Its a great tool if you are thinking baout using steroids and even better if you really are using them. Not to say that i think using steroids is ok. but if you are going to use them you should be as educated as you can about them. This is a good book for that.
5,#1 Steroids Book For 2003!,I read this Monster of all steroid books Steroids 101. Jeff Summers pulls no punches and leaves no question unanswered (even questions you would not think to ask). Steroids 101 is written in hardcore language that speaks directly to all levels of Bodybuilders! There's No Comparison! Steroids 101 is by far the #1 Steroids Book For 2003!
2,Health,For my tast this item was to large for me and there were no size of the item when I bought this.
5,"Awesome album, awesome seller",This was a favorite album of mine years ago when I owned it on a...cassette. I am thrilled to have Darden Smith's voice singing to me once again from CD. Quick shipping from seller. Thank you.
4,Very helpful!,"I've never seen a book like this. I mean, this contains a ver specific info about herbs and helps to know some others plants that it's impossible to get in the US.I use some of this herbs to improve my daily life and beleive me, this is very helpful.I recommend this book to all people who have some health problems or those who want to know how the herbs works on your life.Good luck to all!"
1,No me gusto este libro,"No creo que es una buena compra este libro. El escritor no tomo en cuenta que las plantas tienen diferentes nombre segun cada pais. Ademas no provee fotos; solamente dibujos a blanco y negro de las plantas. No es convincente su contenido. La verdad, no lo recomiendo."
2,Delftware Tiles by Hans van Lemmen PAPERBACK,"The paper back is done completely in black and white. How sad and frustrating not to be able to see the tiles in their original colour. I am really sorry I tried to save money by buying this cheap ""booklet"" (32 small 6""x8"" pages) instead of splurging on the hardback, which is in colour. Content was fine and informative. Order placed May 31st with BoookZine not received 'til June 28th ."
5,Great little machine,"I've had this machine for about two and a half years now, and I've sewed many garments on this machine. I got it for $75, refurbished from Ken's Sewing & Vacuum Center. It's the 2600i teal version.Pros:* Many stitches* Easy to thread upper and lower threads* Can go pretty fast with a lead foot. :)* The standard feet it comes with has been all I've needed for these last two years. I bought a gathering foot, about a week ago, to make my life easier.Cons:* Bobbin doesn't always wind nicely. I sometimes would have to rewind bobbin to bobbin to get it smooth. Not sure if this was a machine or user error."
1,One Word (HERESY),"You can call your church whatever you want it dosen't make you the one true church, even if your church was the one true Church none of you would be saved anyway because Campbell was baptized by a baptist. I am a member of the Church of Christ also the Church of God and the Way or whatever name the church was called in the new testament. You need a genuine encounter with the Lord not a baptismal pool. I would also like to say to Lt. Harry Morant to his comment on Matthew 5:20 let me ask you seriously can you pass the righteousness of the pharisees I know I can't it's a good thing I have Christ's righteousness because I have none of my own, I pray the holy spirit will open your eyes and don't get me wrong I ain't promoting sin there is a fine line between legalism and libertinism."
2,Tedious,"While I'm grateful anyone wrote a book on the topic, this is a numbing look at the ""facts."" It's hard to believe such a slim book on such a rich topic is this dry and uninteresting. Half the problem is that the three or four antecendents of Sondheim's Sweeney Todd are awash in weak indistinguishable characters and developments that do not benefit from close study. The details of melodramas like ""The String of Pearls"" et. al. just do not engage me.Haining himself is tight-lipped and emotionally indecipherable. Just try to figure out what his tone is. It's not a good late-night tale of murder, it's not a crime dossier, it's not thrilling or even disturbing. There is no dramatic arc to his writing. You get the sense that he would have preferred the whole story composed as a giant chart of figures, or that his actual task was to trick readers into belief by sinking them in made-up citations.It was an enormous effort to pick this book up after each pause, and continue."
3,Not as advertised,"This book was a disappointment, not what I was expecting it to be. From the annotation on the back cover I expected it to be a scholarly historical work, with footnotes and such, making the case for Sweeney Todd's existence and chronicling what little is known of his life. Instead, the book provided a few chapters for Todd's life and crimes and his trial, then the second half focused on the impact Todd had on history and all the plays, musicals, etc., done about him. Which is fine if you like that sort of thing, but I had wanted something different. How does the author KNOW all that stuff he wrote about in the biography section actually happened? What are his sources? How do his sources ""prove"" Sweeney Todd existed? I'm not saying I don't think he existed, but I would like to have seen a lot more evidence and argument provided than what I got."
2,Work of Fiction,"The author tries desperately to convince the reader that the mythical tale that inspired the Stephen Sondhiem musical in based in reality. He relies on fictional accounts of the Demon Barber to support his hypothesis. Still, it makes for quick reading, if only to hear the various accounts of the story of Sweeney Todd."
1,worthless,This mask is a piece of crap. Do not buy unless you plan to use it for a costume. It is not for air soft. Looks like the dollar store toys. Should not even be advertised as an airsoft mask
1,BULL CRAP (PULL FROM SHELVES),ok guys and girls just to lett every one know the truths on this mask its crapi got one to test out the reviews i got it for 2.81 with out the shipping just to test it out and see how it would hold up i started the test with a hk co2 360fps the wire mesh held great but on the first 3 shots the right side under the eye got shot off it cracked and left a big hole the piece that covers the mouth the whole strip was blowen away this mask is going to get some kid hurt the only up side to this thing is the goggles they do there job and held up to a revolver that hits 450fps at about 8 foot i say pass on this one there are far better out there
2,sorry,"its all right but breaks after being shot, and then again it is a cheap product so more or less i would buy it again if necessary"
1,Not even worth the five dollars I paid,Ordered this for my nephews birthday. He put it on three times to show it off and the third time it broke. Very cheap!
3,"For the price, decent","Don't expect this mask to stay together, The two pieces fall apart easily. The mesh pops out, but can be fixed with some glue/tape.its pretty decent"
4,Decent Debut,"I think keisha jackson has some good material on this underrated album that came out in the late 80's. The Tracks ""Hot Little Love Affair"", ""U Needa Lover"", ""He's So Jealous"", & ""Lookin Out For #1, are all good tracks. What this album lacks is a hit and memorable material. I think keisha should have had more ""Above Average"" material. Her voice is good although like one reviewer said she souds a bit like her mom but that is fine. However, I don't think that keisha should have given up so quick. If she would have stayed in the music business she might have embarked on a hit w/ some good producers."
4,A good wallop of a space opera,"What you see is what you get: this is an enormously entertaining, but ultimately shallow, space opera. If you feel the need (as I occasionally do), to dip your feet into the kiddy pool you swam in when you first started reading science fiction, then this is the series for you! I enjoyed myself immensely, as I watched Green take his overstuffed universe and wring it through its changes as he escalated the conflict. It's not deep, it's not important, but it's a great deal of fun!"
2,A Slog,"Perhaps because I read the first and moved to the second in the series so quickly it became an effort to continue through the storyline to the end. I found myself skimming more frequently as the end of the book neared. I will likely look for the remaining books in the series at the library or simply read the ""Cliff Notes"" version in Wikipedia to satisfy my curiosity."
1,"As of 15 Nov, I have not recieved the book.","I have no idea what is going on,but as of today I have not recieved the book. Maybe I would have better luk with another bookseller."
5,go buy it now!,"this book is a must for anyone you will ever call themselves a sci-fi fan, I recommend all of the books in the deathstalker series., why are you still here? I told you to go buy the book."
1,unmitigated tripe,"Simon R. Green takes all the pieces of any space opera you have ever read, stirs in more cliches than you would have thought possible, bakes, and writes it all down badly. Whenever he doesn't know what to do next, he adds more aliens, each one alledgedly new and different and yet described so badly that they blend into one another. Descriptions of people are not only reused between books but sometimes reused word for word in the same book! Finally, the characterizations are flat and virtually identical - if it weren't clearly indicated, you'd never know who is talking.This is pretty much science fiction at its worst. Space opera can be good, even great, but this isn't it."
5,fantastic!,"Connie Sheerin's book provides us with clear, concise instructions to create imaginative projects! Her bathroom backsplashes are really so special and she has a wonderful sense of color and pattern. For anyone interested in the art of mosaic, this book is the one to buy."
4,Off & Running,Just received this book & have already started on my first project. Great book for the beginner like myself as it providesd me with a detailed list of supplies to to have on hand before I started on a project. Easy to follow instructions & pictures.
3,Excelent Book with a poor material,"The book is excelent! it contains everything that we need to know about Filterbanks, Multirate systems ans even a little about wavelets. But the material used to build the book (the cover, the paper, etc) Is too fragile and is not of good quality. It is a pitty that they build such a nice book with such poor material."
4,A Forgotten Piece Of Metal Heaven,"These guys came out a minute too late. This disc is crammed full of heavy hook laden, melodic rock and roll. One of the best tracks is the live song Is that All You Want From Me. The other is Bad Reputation. If you are a serious glam metal fan you must grab a hold of this rare item. Every song is strong."
3,Worth the money?,"The Heritage of Shannara combines the Scions, Druid, Elfqueen and talismans of Shannara into one large voulme with some pretty nifty new cover art to boot.And that's all folks!As much as I loved these books, there is no compelling reason to drop the money to buy this edition as there is no extra material or the like to justify a seperate purchase (unless of course you do not own the originals.)While it may be true that this is an attempt to provide a cheap(er) alternative to those who do not already own the books and would like them in hardcover, the long time fans who bought the books in hardcover are left out here. Some insights from the author, some art work or something of the like would have gone a long way toward making buying this worthwhile for those who own the original.I give the stories within this book 5 stars.The book itself gets 1 star."
4,Shanara fans rejoice - 4 in 1- Great book,"I was introduced to the world of Shanara rather late, age of 29. I read the first three books and enjoyed thema greta so, so much so that I went right out and bought the Heritage of Shanara as well. After all, four books for the price of one you really can't go wrong.As with the Sword of Shanara trilogy I was not disappointed t ll with these books. They tell an epic tale, with believable characters and a unique setting that makes you just want to keep reading. I have heard from others that the Heritage series is the pinicale of writing for Brooks so I have yet to purchase anything beyond this series. But, even if you only read up to these books as I have done you will not be disappointed. Fantastic reads and a great epic journey."
2,Wish I could give separate scores for story and book quality,"You don't actually need my review of the story; there are plenty of others. It's a good story. However, the formatting of the Kindle edition is terrible.First, the table of contents simply consists of the book titles of the four novels in this edition. No chapters, just the start of each book. Inconvenient, but not uncommon.Second, and much worse: there are no breaks in between paragraphs (i.e., double space) when there is a change of scene or change of character point-of-view. It's a very difficult read without this simple formatting necessity, because it's seldom immediately obvious from the narrative that there has been a scene change. The result is confusion until you realize that something doesn't add up, then you have to go back and re-read from where the break should have been."
5,Heritage Of Shannara,I actually read this trilogy many years ago when it came out. I re-purchased it for my Kindle recently as I have been reading some of Terry Brooks earlier works after just finishing his most recent novel. The second time around was even better and this remains one of the most engaging series I have ever read. I was surprised at the details I had forgotten and I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the novels again. I hope Mr. Brooks continues to write and publish his stories for many years to come!
2,Annoying,"The main characters in this book second guess everything to a fault, they just whine and whine about who they are, and what has been ""done"" to them... it is really tiring. They eventually step up but it is like pulling teeth... and even when doing what they are destined to do they complain the entire time and second guess themselves."
5,Dave Gives Great Advice!,"This book is a great read! I really enjoyed all of the tips and hints that Dave gives throughout. As a Team In Training member I thought I had learned a lot, but after reading Dave's book I really added a lot to my bag of tricks. If you are serious about doing a marathon this book is a definite must!"
5,The Complete Guide to Marathon Walking,"This book is very helpful for someone who has never done a marathon and now that I have one behind me, I'm using this to review and prepare for a second marathon. It covers everything from what to wear, eat, stretches, training schedule, injuries, recovery, etc. A great read!"
5,great salsa songs with vibrant images to go with it.,the salsa songs here are great and vibrant which qualifies for good salsa dancing. the visuals are also creative and exhibits those sexy salsa dancers which add to the hotness of this video. highly recommended.
4,good light,"This is the 4th one is these I'be bought. I keep them in my bitch-bag, in my bob and in my desk.Decent light, superlong battery life, and compact size makes for a great package."
1,Only bought this for the CCE exam through AACEI,"AACEI does not use this as a reference for the test anymore since it is out of print. I got it cheap, and it is much harder to digest than the AACEI reference books we need for the test. I will still keep it as a reference just in case it shows up as a reference in a technical paper from a few years ago."
5,"Malcom McLaren, tu manques!","Everyone should be Deep in Vogue at least once. Electro funk=Electro Fun. Waltz with me Darling. On a legendary night at the Paradise garage all the Houses of New York met to dance. dance. dance. Throw some shade,dish the dirt, and get down with their bad selves. La Beija,DuPree,Xtravaganza,(name of your house here). Love this cd. It has historical importance eventhough it was a rather short spurt culturally.It was a fun and elegant moment. With Bootsy Collins and the Bootzilla Orchestra! Pretty cover art! Also recommeded the film ""Paris Is Burning"", the cd ""Fans"". Madge knows."
5,Fun throwback,A fun throwback to my youth; glad that they re-released this as I only had it on cassette! A must have for New Kids fans.
1,These guys your mixed up with don't know right from wrong.,"If y'all want some crackheads, listen to Marilyn Manson (who bites, but, oh well) and if you want wuss rock listen to the Yucky Boys, I mean Backstreet Boys. There is no such thing as the best of both loser worlds."
5,just trying to have my collection back :),anything about NKOTB will have a 5 stars rate. Already knew the product & was just trying to get my collection back :))
5,"Values courage, honor, respect","Captivating and enchanting story for children and families to share. Beautifully produced. It accurately portrays medieval England's culture and social structure. Shows great role models that exhibit courage, honor, equality and respect (with a touch of humor thrown in). Our kid reviewers were riveted. They commented: ""I would love to travel back in time."" ""I noticed that the Nobles were unkind to the Serfs, but that's how it really was."" ""I want to read the Mark Twain book that the story is based on."" ""The castle was awesome."" We found that 8 to 12-year-olds liked this best."
4,Good movie,"One of Whoopi's first TV(?) movie, remember watching it when my kids were younger, purchased it for my daughter.Wasn't as great as I remembered. Still it was enjoyable! Its always good to watch Whoopi!"
4,Pleased,I haven't opened the package yet because its a gift but this dish set looks like it was very nice quality and worth the $ I paid.
5,Couldnt put it down.,I love this book. Great projects. If you love to make little bags and things this book is for you. I don't seem to have any problems following the direction. And I an just a person that does not sew much.
1,Manure smell is unbearable!,"I always buy huge bags of Miracle Gro potting soil each year for my container plants, especially my tomatoes or new flowers. The Micromax Miracle Gro looks like a bag of bark mulch - lots of big chips and chunks, and smells like straight manure!! It has been three weeks since I planted my containers - adding last years soil and peat moss, and they still smell so strongly of manure that I hate to water them or even walk by them. First Miracle Gro product that I hate. Too soon for any growth apparently, so who knows!"
5,shopping a joy,"thanks for your quick response in filling this order. I would definitely consider using, this vendor again, it's transactions such as these that making shopping on-line enjoyable."
1,not worth it,"I can't figure out what is wrong with these blades, except they are inferior to any other gillette blade that I have ever encountered. They are rough and have actually left cuts on my lip area with a new blade. I thought maybe it was just one of the packets with duller blades. But both packages are the same inferior product. Should have just spent the extra $5 and gotten them at Walgreens. Avoid these."
2,not the same!,"I'm tired of this game where you think you're buying the same product you buy in the stores but it is anything but the same! This was like shaving with a dull twin blade! Took me twice as long to shave! I assumed ""mach 3"" was mach 3! I'm going back to buying them at costco!"
1,Not Good!!!!,"I purchased this fixture along with other Monticello products for our bathroom remodel. This lighting fixture has screw on rings that are suppose to tighten and keep the globes in place, however no matter how many times I've tighten them they constantly come down. This leaves the globes to dangle and if it weren't for the bulb the globes would fall off. Also it's not easy to fit your hand inside the globe to tighten and re-tighten the rings. I would not recommend this product and will be replacing it."
5,Moen Monticello Light fixture,"I purchased this light to match my Moen Monticello faucet and I it looks very nice! The other reviews I read said that the glass was not seated properly to the metal fixture, causing an improper fit. I solved that problem by turning the metal piece (used to screw on the glass shadeto the fixture) around and it worked perfectly. The glass shade held on tightly to the fixture. Problem solved."
1,Not manufactured well,"One arm broke off the light while my electrician was installing it. The arms were not positioned symmetrically when first removed from the box, but were too stiff to adjust. Because I had purchased several of them...I ended up having to purchase a replacement of the same light for one bathroom, and it was delivered the same as the first 3. I would not recommend this item."
2,Moen name WITHOUT the Quality,"I already read the reviews so I knew it wouldn't be Moen quality and of course it isn't. It isn't made by Moen, just licensed. I wanted it to match my Moen Monticello hardware so I decided to deal with it. It's not an exact match but matches nicely, wife is happy. The finish looks nice now but up close you can see it's a low quality Chinese finish, I don't expect it to last(I give it 4 years and finish will be failing). The nuts that hold the globes really don't fit well but I had no issue with them. The globes are thin and fragile. None of the materials are anything like the quality of the Moen hardware. Basically it's a cheap Chinese light that matches Moen pretty well, I find the price high for Chinese quality.I had to get a second one because the cheap finish on the first one was missing on some parts. Amazon took care of it quickly and one day shipped me another."
2,Boys In Cold,"What is this? When I first saw the video for ""Standing in the Shadows"", I thought that this was heavier than their debut. When I listened to In Motion back in 89, I was totally disappointed that was the first song on the album. I gave the whole thing a listen and only found three songs worth listening to. ""Standing in the shadows"" what a great song, they were standing in the shadows of their peers and they didn't make it out of their peers limelight. They hung on till they couldn't hang on anymore and then they just fell out of the light. A very ill-fated attempt to cover Hair Of The Dog, I don't know why they tried to, but it didn't do anything for the song and it sure didn't sound any different. Dizzy left the band after this cd. Well I would have left to after this. I am not embarrased to say that I own this album, I am embarrased to say that I bought it brand new when it first came out. Lesson learn. Oh yeah, the best songs on this are: Standing in the shadows, Shine on, Long road."
4,Not bad for their sophmore effort,"A good solid product. I would say that their debut along with 'Bite Down Hard' are a notch or two above this one, however."
2,Terrible,"Confusing diagrams, odd formula derivations with insufficient explanation as to what's important and what is not. There are many minor typographical errors, though those do little more than annoy. I have struggled for hours trying to glean some meaning from this book and am bewildered at the authors' methods and content organization. This book is almost incomprehensible, and is only useful (sometimes) for its exhaustive breakdowns of concepts. This book throws every bit of everything at you with no regard to helping you understand aircraft performance or design."
2,"brilliant concept, but ultimately disappointing","I wanted to like this CD, I really did, as I feel the concept is pure genius. Somehow, Robbie Robertson is able to ""modernize"" traditional native american music in a way that works (for me), and Deep Forest seemed to ""modernize"" African traditional music in a way that worked. But I could only tolerate a few tracks of this well-intentioned CD. Jazz and percussion just don't seem to mesh with the ""lullabye"" gist. I would love to hear this re-released without the Western influences and vocal translations."
2,Tries a little too hard,"There are a couple of great tracks on this album and some wonderful singing.But!!! There is little unity between the western and middle eastern singers and the musical accompaniment and is often intrusive. It sounds like it was recorded in the studio later and added in, as it often has little to with the song, the singer or the singers style. I wish they had just recorded the singers acapela. That would have been a great album."
2,Disappointed lullabies,"I was slightly disappointed with this CD. I had thought that I would get to enjoy the songs in the foreign language only, but that is not true. Most of the songs have a verse of the original language followed by that verse sung in english. The music that accompanies each song doesn't make any sense. It doesn't sound like lullabies.Still some of the sounds can still be enjoyed. The singers from the various countries are all great with one exception. The english-speaking woman on the first track has a voice so deep i can't listen to that song."
2,Lullabies? Not really. World music fans? Possibly,"Really not lullabies per se. Kind of odd mix of songs that aren't particularly soothing. If you really want lullabies, try the Putamayo line for multi-culti music."
4,This Grimm is no fairy-tale,"Very nice book! The edition I own is the 1983 printing, so I am unfamiliar with recent changes. Book has good drawings of leaves (often several), fruits, twigs, buds and leaf scars. Excellent info on summer and winter identification included in text and step-by-step outlines. The step-by-step outline starts at the front of the book and helps you identify the family in which the tree in question belongs. Then turn to the section on that tree family for help isolating which species you have on your hands. There are good text descriptions throughout to aid identification as well as information on history, growth, and commercial uses of the trees. Not a field guide for the size and weight conscious though. Keep it in your living room or SUV."
5,Best Guide on the East Coast,"This is by far the best field guide I have ever used for identifying woody plants on the East Coast. I've been using it for an state park internship, and have identified almost ever species in the park. The dichotomous key is easy to use, very complete, and certainly beats flipping through page after page comparing photographs to the tree in front of you. The line drawings are more user-friendly than photographs, as there are no background plants to distract the reader from the tree in question, and the major details of leaves, bark, and scars can be more easily pointed out. While larger than most field guides, it fits well in a backpack; comes with me everywhere. A must for anyone dealing in an outdoors setting."
3,Not for the Untrained,"I was a Pre-forestry major in college some 40+ years ago, so I had some training in how plants are classified by scientists and some experience in using such a technical manual as this to identify the trees and shrubs I was unfamiliar with. Nonetheless, this is not easily done and perhaps it had been too long past since I engaged in such an endeavor. I do know that if it wasn't for that training I could not have used this manual at all as it is not for the untrained who want to find simple directions on how to identify the tree or shrub they are interested in. To be fair, with all the diversity of God's creation and the close similarity of many species, a simpler manual might not give the most absolute accuracy but at least you would probably be able to get in close proximity. This manual would leave you frustrated and confused unless you have some professional experience."
3,good but without color,"I used it sometimes for my study, then I realized there are more books out there with colored photos/pictures. I don't judge this book it's not good, but should be better with color."
3,Latin Cello,"Well, I didn't get what I thought I was getting. It was the wrong item. The music is fine--just not what I wanted."
3,quite okay,The book is supposed to serve as a guide to users of the LISREL program. I did not quite like the book because I am a fresh user to the program and the book does not take you step by step to what is required in doing structural equation modeling. this book assume that the reader has an understanding of statistical techniques involved. the book is good for the examples they give which are found in the program itself and the detail they provide on the syntax of using the LISREL program.
3,Just Okay,"These bars are reasonably priced, but the packaging of the bars was inadequate and one of the bars arrived dented. Amazon was great with the return, but the second shipment also arrived dented, but in an inconspicuous location. Therefore I decided not to return the second package and just take it ""as is"".The bars were easy to install, but that's because I watched a youtube video of how to install another manufacture's bars on a sierra. DeeZee's instructions were okay, but could be more clear. The whole install took about 2 hours. I would recommend the use of a breaker-bar or torque wrench to remove and retighten the body bolts.The bars look sharp after having been installed; well see how long they'll last that way given how easily they dented during shipping."
4,practical and pretty,"were easy to install and they are fully functional, not just for looks.the brackets could have been built better and the tubing should have been alittle heavier.all in all a good product.and as always amazon gets it done quick."
5,Great bra at a reasonable price,"This is a great fitting bra and comfortable too. After several washings, still looks and feels like brand new."
5,Great product!,I used these sheets for save the date magnets for my wedding. The magnets turned out great and were so easy to do. I have a HP deskjet 882c and all I did was put the paper in one at a time & had no problems at all. I highly recommend trying these sheets.
5,Where's The DVD??????,"This is a spectacular ""Living Room"" show from Carole King. One of the finest singer-songwriters of our time. It goes without saying that this is a concert I would really have loved to see.I guess my point here is really a question? Why didn't they film this? If they did.........please release it on DVD."
4,Living Room Album,It's lots of fun. Carole King tries to make you feel like you're right there and part of her music live.
3,Love Carole But....,"I love Carole King. Who doesn't? She's a brilliant songwriter, and I have great admiration for her.The problem on this recording is her voice. I keep wanting to tell her to clear her throat. She also doesn't hit some of the notes. I wanted to love this, but it's just not a good recording, and I believe that if this were anyone but Carole King all of the reviews would be bad.I'm giving this 3 stars for purely nostalgic reasons."
5,Awesome CD!,This is the best CD I've heard in a long time. Carole King is one of the best song writers around and I always enjoy listening to her music. I love the Living Room Tour. Thank You.
4,The Living Room Tour CD by Carol King,"I first heard the Living Room Tour CD on the Sunday Morning TV show where they devoted a spot to Carol King and her music. It brought back so many memories that I began dancing around the living room. My daughter was a teenager when we both first fell in love with Carol King's music. She is now a busy mother of two teenagers and lives in another state. I ordered her a copy too and surprised her with it by mail. When she received it and called me to thank me, I could hear the same upbeat note in her voice that Carol had inspired in me. Carol King has gotten older too, but her music and performance are still great!"
4,Sad loss of the crystalline voice...,"but the spirit still shines...Who doesn't remember the exquisite quality of Carol's voice in her (and our) youth? That's how I think of her still--her voice encased in amber in my mind--so it was a real shock to detect the raspy and almost hard quality of her voice in much of this album. At first listen, that damage was all I could hear, and it made for some seriously tough going. Glad I white-knuckled it, however, because what's missing from the voice is remedied to quite an extent by the heart of the music and of the singer. They can't do nips and tucks with aging stars' voices the way they can erase signs of age from the rest of the body---and maybe that's not a bad thing. Carol is one 62 year old with a lot of great music to share with us still."
4,she sing a simple tune,Brilliant experience for Lady Carole. She re-sing her story with great simplicity. True stories out of time.
4,Relaxed and Comfortable,"Carol King sounded relaxed and comfortable in her live performance.Her talent is enormous, but she could have used a few more band members...maybe a rhythm section, but I'm just nipicking."
2,AHHHH Carole,"I read some of these reviews & I wasn't sure if I had the same CD. When I see a CD for half price, a month after it is released, I wonder why(?). But I purchased this CD anyway, because I'm a Carole King fan. After the first 2 songs, I realized why it was half price. I now own 2 very expensive coasters. Where is Been to Canaan, or Corazon or Brother Brother or the drums or the sax in Jazzman. I'm sorry, but I had to remove it from my car's player. I almost thru them out the window, but decided not to. Not to be cruel, but this CD stinks. I own her live album from a few years ago & it's far better than this one. DON'T waste your money. I gave it 2 stars because I like her music."
1,The Living Room Tour,"I have always been a fan of Carole King, but I am sorry to say that this album really disappointed me. I wish I could return it, I will not listen to it a second time."
2,THIS IS PRETTY DARN CRAPPY,"Wow! Before buying this CD I read the glowing reviews and thought I have to buy these CD's. I am very disappointed, Carole sounds simply awful, I can't believe she put this product on the market. The vocals are awful plain and simple. The sound quality of the CD is no better, BUYER BEWARE THE REVIEWS OF THIS CD ARE WAY OFF. You would find better use for your money by going out into the street and just throwing it into the air, hoping that who ever picked it up would have more sense than to spend it on this poor endeavor. I swear there are songs where Carole sounds like she is dying a slow death."
1,It was so bad I returned it.,Bad vocals and boring. Was a chore to listen to it. Once was enough and I returned it
1,Awful recording,"I don't know if it was the recording engineers fault, the engineer that set up the show, or just her awful raspy voice, but I was sick in the stomach listening to all the distortion in her voice. Killing me."
1,Its To Late...to get my money back,"I found this two disc set at a flea market for ""only"" $5.00, and thought I had stumbled onto a steal. After listening to just the first disc I was the one who got fleased. Carol's vocals at 62 are so bad you wonder what they were thinking when they put this live disc out. A very disapointing selection from one of the 70's best singer/songwriters."
4,The Living Room Tour,"A great collecxtion of great songs by a great artist, brillantly done in a laid back atmosphere...Loved it!! Jim Russell"
5,A Fantastic Album,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable and listenable tour-de-force by a lady who sounds better today than she did when she started recording 30+ years ago. The music is still fresh and delightful. Limiting her back-up to her own piano, two guitars, and background vocals allows the melodies and words come through for the ultimate effect. I only wish I could have been at the concert!"
5,Great Show!,I loved it! I was very entertained and was able to follow the show and be entranced by it at the same time. Good work!
4,Great Piano Songs,"I like all the songs and most of all the unique arrangement by Jim Brickman himself. It's just like bringing and listening Jim Brickman to our home. Though it needs a lot of practice to master each songs, I love every bit of it and enjoy playing it in the comforts of my home. For those who are fond of piano songs and instrumental, this is a must have. Also, I would like to appreciate my shopping with amazon.com which has been great and easy for me especially the free shipping. Sure enough, I would be shopping with them again in the future. Thank you.Roen DiazAthens,AL"
2,"Brickman-like, but not Brickman transcriptions","These arrangements have the standard syncopated Brickman stylings and harmonies. Nevertheless, I was disappointed to find that they are not necessarily note-for-note transcriptions of his recorded versions. While Joy to the World is probably an accurate transcription, Oh Holy Night is nowhere close. In fact, its not even a good arrangement in my opinion. Silent nite is close but missing some harmonic notes that intermediate pianists can probably fill in, especially if you know how to play from a fake book. Fortunately, a more faithful version of Oh Holy Night (albeit simpler) is available for digital downloaded on its own through a separate website.So if you just want to have Jim Brickman type of arrangements of Christmas Carols, you will be happy with the book. If you wanted to actually replicate some of his stylings and capture his sound, this album is hit or miss."
5,Great Arrangements for Christmas,"I have multiple compilations of Christmas music arranged by various composers, Jim Brickman and Dan Coates are by far my favorite. I purchased my copy via a local music store, not through Amazon. Christmas Themes (New Age) is my favorite book although there are only 10 arrangements. Most of the melodies everyone knows by heart, so it's not too difficult to improvise by either adding more notes (ie small run of notes going up or down the scale, arpeggiating, or adding thirds) or leaving out some notes altogether as the mood strikes you. Thanks Jim Brickman and could you please publish a follow-up Volume 2 ?"
3,Difficult rhythm,"I thought the music was a bit more challenging than I expected, especially the rhythm aspect. It seems like he adds syncopation to every single measure and that gets quite annoying (for me anyway) to play. I've learned the piece ""The Gift"" before and thought his other pieces would be similar, but I think the rest in the book are a bit more complicated and I'm just not feeling like making the effort to learn all of his complicated rhythmns. Maybe I should have listened to more of his music before ordering one of his books."
5,the best of ClareM yet,I love Ms. Mcnally's book but this is the best. I read it when it first came out. Then reread it two years later and then two years after that. I never read a book twice but this was so good it was worth reading THREE times. When is her next book coming out?
5,Kept me on the edge of my seat.,This was my first experience with Ms. McNally.I loved the story and her characters.I couldn't put it down.I look forward to discovering her other works.
3,Quickfix Total Cardio Kick,"Not too bad, but I did not feel like I was getting a good cardio workout. Also, I did not feel like my abs got much out of it. Other than that, good for legs and arms."
5,A workout for anyone,"This is the first time I purchased a workout DVD. I have some arthritis in my knees and have lower back issues so traditional situps and bike riding don't work for me. I purchased this DVD with Quick Fix Hip Hop Abs and I prefer this one. I don't have issues with my knees or back when I do these workouts and I love the chance to do just one of the 3 workouts if I'm pressed for time. I recommend this to anyone with knee or back issues and quite honestly to anyone else also. I found it a bit tough to keep up with in the beginning but it didn't take long to follow along, I am amazed I actually look forward to the workouts."
4,Get ready for a fast-paced workout!,"I am not a work-out-kind-of-person at all... I wanted to learn a little kickboxing, and lose some weight. This dvd sports pretty good music while introducing you to some kickboxing moves, and cardio exercises. I would even go so far as to say it's fun! If you are new to working out, be prepared for some serious sweating, and if you are new to kickboxing, no worries, Janis goes slow enough to introduce each new move... you'll get it! The only problem I have with her routines are the warm-ups: they're too fast to provide any real muscle warming-up. I highly recommend stretching on your own (yoga stretching works best for me), before the workouts begin; that way, soreness will be decreased, and you'll less likely pull muscles, etc. Aside from the silly ""warm-up"" and cool-down moves, the rest is a ""blast"". I guarantee you'll sweat, especially during the ""bonus blast"" workout."
4,Quick Solution,"Most of the Janis Saffel videos I have done are quite difficult. This one is not on the same level. I am still giving 4 stars because its a great video to do in a hurry. it has 3 10 min sessions, like the 10 min solutions, only they have 5. What is great about it, is it has a count down clock in the corner. The other issue I have with this video is the replacement of one of her back-up crew. Her videos have always featured very real people and in this one she has one of her old companions but the other girl is a prettier more toned girl then I have seen in her own videos. When will these production companies learn that we like real people! I would defiantly recommend this video to any beginning kickboxer."
4,Fast Paced Workout,"This DVD follows the usual Quick Fix DVD formats of splitting the workout into three 10 min sessions. The DVD is primarily cardio though does incorporate some crunches. It is fast paced with not much in the way of introduction or stretching as you seem to go straight into the workout. It makes you sweat and I am sure I have lost a few calories but the instructor does not stop talking the whole way through, not even pausing for breath which is going to get irritating if you watch the DVD regularly. Overall I'm happy with it and would recommend it."
3,Not for beginners!,I was not too happy with this DVD. It definetly is not for beginners. I thought that she went to fast also. Was dissappointed.
2,Too dancy,If you are a dancer you'll probably like this routine. If you are not a dancer you won't have a clue as to what's going on until you watch the DVD many times. I chose NOT to watch it many times and do not recommend it for someone looking for a kick-type cardio work out.
4,Great Variety!,"This is a good quick kickboxing workout, espcially if you add wrist and ankle weights. It's good for beginners but probably not challenging enough for advanced people. It's still a good work out and the best workout is the 10-minute bonus total body workout-it really gets your heart pumping. Although the host looks like Barbie, her back-up girls are muscular and ripped (keeps you motivate to look like them!!)"
4,Easy cardio for easy workout days,"I bought this DVD for days I don't want to sit down on my desk all day, thinking I did nothing for my body, but either don't have the time or energy for a die hard workout session. I like the fact that time flies with it, the instruction is pretty good, the music is pleasant and I get a bit of an increase in my heart rate.This video is for my ""easy cardio days"" as I call it. I try to work out 6 times a week: I do 2 times Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30, 2 times SWAT Weight Loss workout, which are pretty tough bootcamp type workouts. So I want to take a break in between with Quick Fix in the other 2 days.Don't get me wrong, it is a great workout for beginners; it is just not THE full cardio workout for the intermediate or advanced. Hence, the four stars."
5,Great Video and Great Instructor,"I think that this is a great video. It gets you working with simple, easy-to-execute moves. I would consider myself in the 'intermediate' workout range, and I thought that it was a really fun way to get the heart rate up. The cueing is excellent by Janis. It's not the most challenging workout, but that's fine -- this is perfect for days that warrant lighter intensity."
2,Average,This was average. It had you do the same move too many times and I found it a bit boring. It would have been better if it had different combinations similar to what you find at a gym kickboxing class.
4,Hmmm....,"If you have never done kickboxing then this may go too fast. There is not a lot of demonstration time, and not enough warning on some of the ""up next"" moves. Great intensity. Gets your heart rate up - less than a minute warm up, less than a minute cool down. The core section is not that great (for you core). There are 3 10 minute workouts - legs, arms, and core."
5,Great DVD!,"I really enjoy this DVD and it made me want to buy more Janis Saffel DVDs (which I recently did!). She is a great instructor...not annoying, very good cueing, basic but effective moves. I never get sick of putting on this DVD because I can always rotate between the 4 workouts (I usually do 2-3 workouts at a time). There isn't a real warm-up or cool-down, which is probably the only small negative, but I just do it on my own. This is a great DVD if you're short on time and want to get a good cardio/toning session in during your day."
3,"Like instructor, good for beginners","I am probably an intermediate level of fitness. Really like this instructor. This video is good, but I didn't really break much of a sweat. Her other Strike Zone kickboxing DVD is a much better workout for me."
4,Simple to follow,I purchased this DVD as an addition to a self defense unit that our school teaches. The students seemed to enjoy the workout.
3,Quick fix cardio DVD,"This quick fix: Total Cardio Kick DVD is okay, nothing to write home about but helpful for a quick work out."
3,more aerobic vs KB,i bought this for a few new combinations but find it is more aerobic KB versus KB if i new it was that i would not have bought it.
1,Too easy,This is a beginner's workout. I found it boring. I used it just theone time. Thank goodness it was cheap.
5,Simple and quick,"I would not say this is her ""Best"" video but it is a good workout for beginners and a quick one for intermediate. It kept my attention and went by fast. I use it as a cardio video for an extra 30 minutes after my hard workout."
4,I love this DVD,"I'm not an advanced exerciser and can barely keep up and I certainly feel it the next day, but Janis does a good job of keeping me motivated and I enjoy it despite the difficulty."
5,Fun kickboxing video...,"I really like this video, it is divided into 4 parts, you can do any or all of them depending on how much time you have. The first is upper body with assorted punches, jabs, crosses, hooks and upper cuts. The lower body section has some squats, front and side kicks, knees, etc. The core section has a different variety of moves to work your abs, crunches, knees raises, etc. There is a 10 minute bonus blast that is a shorter version of the 3 other sections. I would rate this video as intermediate, though beginners could use it too. Advanced people most likely would not find it challenging.This workout is led by Janis Saffell who has led other kickboxing videos, she does a great job in this one. She is joined by 2 other exercisers, one who shows beginner modifications. They have very inspiring figures and execute great form. Good music in this workout also, for those who like kickboxing this is a good video for your collection."
1,Disappointed; Cottrell much better,"I had high hopes for this book but was ultimately disappointed. Forline's sometimes explains things brilliantly, but much of the time he writes in an inconsistent manner, provides unsatisfactory explanations, and isn't entirely clear. Try Cottrell's ""The Faith Once For All: Bible Doctrine For Today"" if you want a one volume systematic theology written from a non-Calvinist perspective. It is biblical, logical, thorough, precise, clear, and comprehensive. IMO, it's the best."
2,Mishap in shipping.,"I would really like to review this product, but being as to it was not the product that I recieved, I cannot. I did however recieve a cd by a group calling themselves ""The Front"" that was released in 2006, which in turn was not a alltogether bad cd. However I have tried to contact the seller from this transaction thru the review site email link about 4-5 days ago and have still yet to hear from them on this mishap. I will say that their response time in shipping the pkg. was good, but since they shipped the wrong pkg. I would have to give them a D- (The only reason it's not a F is that the cd they sent ended up being ok)"
2,"Good travel cable, but NOT compatible with Tungsten C","Although this cable lists compatibility with Tungsten W and T, and it will charge a Tungsten C model, it will not sync with C models. This information is buried on the support pages instead of the compatiblity page of the manufacturer's web site. I would have given this 4 stars if they had disclosed this.If it had worked with my palm, I would say that it is very compact and light weight. It is similar in size to a white board marker when reeled in. The cable isn't long at 30 inches, but usually that is enough. Highly recommended as a compact alternative to a cradle.The plug where the usb connector is attached to the cable looks like it might not last forever cause the cable is so thin and you usually accidentally push on the connection when plugging in the cable. But if you want compact for travel or as a backup to IR this is the choice."
2,Not as advertised.,"The low price on this was great for a traveling charger for my Palm, but it is advertised as a syncer, but it doesn't sync at all. A little disappointing, but for the low price, I couldn't complain too much."
4,Decent sync cable,I like the idea that it's retractable but it didn't fix my problem with the hot sync issue I thought I had. I think it's something in my palm but this item is compatable with the Zire 71 and would power it. It's a little bit of a tight squeeze to connect the cable to the palm but it works.
3,BEWARE RErecordings!,"These ""hit"" songs by the Kendalls are not the original 70's Ovation or 80's Mercury hit versions! They are a late 1980's (1989) session of RErecorded versions for Epic Records..."
3,Many Celtic Goddesses,"This book is filled with Celtic Goddesses and beliefs of their origin and relation to each other. Well laid out and written, but very academic. Almost overly academic as if the authors feel like they really have to prove their research and background. Many historical sources are sited."
3,Not a story - more of an encyclopedia!,"I bought this book not realizing it wasn't a novel. It's basically a compilation of what seemed like spells and explanations of who characters are supposed to be. I'm a big fan of Marion Zimmer Bradley's books, but I'm a fan of her ability to spin her tales. Her stories bind you to them and keep you so interested you don't want to put them down (even when they're over). Unfortunatly I was dissapointed with this book. If you want some great books try Bradley's Mist's of Avalon, The Forest House, Or Lady of the Lake. I'm going to give this book another try, but think twice about this book because it's unlike Bradley's books as it doesn't pull you into it. You have to give it some real effort."
2,Not the best book on the subject,"Overly complex in exposition. Insufficiently illustrated. Represents an NIH viewpoint, not the best in science. Does not relate the molecular details to the cellular interactions sufficiently."
3,"Well Made, But Hard to Install","I bought this shelf to replace a worn out one under the the sink in the bathroom vanity. The shelf is very well constructed but has too many mounting points, located on multiple tabs at 90 degrees to the mounting direction; each tab has two holes, one outside and one inside of the roller frame. The outer holes are impossible to reach if the shelf is close to a cabinet divider and the inner holes are partially blocked by the rolling shelf itself, making it very difficult to start the mounting screws. It took far to long and too much effort to install this shelf. Also, switching sides for the upper shelf requires partial disassembly so you had better do it before installing the whole unit."
2,Beware of sizing,"Beware that this unit is actually larger than advertised. The width is posted at 12"". However that is just the bottom wire basket. If you include the upright supports for the upper basket, the width is 12 3/8"". So unless you have at least a 12 1/2"" opening, I would not order this product."
3,sturdy,"The product is well made but more difficult to install in a cramped space under the sink than you might imagine. It works well, we bought a second one."
3,Decent seat covers,"These seat covers were some of the only ones that I found that fit the large seats of a GMC Crew Cab pick-up. They fit the seats OK and the fit was tight except for being somewhat billowy near the headrest area. They puckered slightly in the small of the back, which may be due to the fact that the tightening straps weren't long enough to be used. Once the covers on the seating areas were on, the lengths of the straps that connect around behind the seats were too short to reach. They stretch some, but not enough. Trying to stretch them causes the strap to start to rip out of the material where its sewed in. You could probably come up with some kind of extender piece to add to the existing straps to lengthen them enough to clip to the reinforcing flap that slips between the seat and the seatback, but that may not get them tight enough.Overall, they work and its hard to get a one-size fits all product to be perfect, so these will likely meet your needs."
2,Not what I expected,Not what I expected - very different -- definitely not my kind of music -- will not purchase their music again!
5,Hilarious!,"When it comes to reviewing Dilbert stuff, I have a simple acronym that seems to say it all (and would fit well within the world Dilbert and his friends inhabit): K.I.S.S. -- for Keep It Simple Stupid. This calendar is chock-full of sarcastic and witty cartoons about Dilbert and his never-ending life as an employee at the office from Hell. If he's not battling the Pointy-Haired Boss, he's trying to one-up his so called best friend Dogbert in whatever scheme the more-human-than-canine is cooking up. I received the 1999 calendar as a gift from a friend and recently received the 2000 from the same person, and I'm delighted. Dilbert's misadventures are a lot closer to reality than anyone is willing to admit -- and this calendar will remind you of that daily! This is an excellent calendar to have!"
3,An interesting twist.,"I enjoyed this book overall, but I must say that there were quite a few times when I found things hard to keep track of. The writing style leaves something to be desired. It almost rambles and leaves you guessing who's who and what's going on. But if you like Templar history I think you'll be glad you read it. He gives some good insights into the psychology of the time."
5,Get up on it,I think that is the first artist with creative & strange aspect of hip hop like freestyle fellowship or kool keith etc.. if you buy this album you have a lot of chance he's very hard to fine even me I have only a copy of him one day i'll found it on a small cd store at the final I say only one word hip hop
2,Music Maker...Not for the uninitiated,"I bought Music Maker after shopping Sony Acid and the Cakewalk product. It appeared that neither of the latter two allowed you to import actual performed music (not just loops or midi files) and work with them, so I went with Music Maker. Big Mistake. This is the most complicated, non-intuitive piece of software I have ever seen. It is an English remake of an original German product, which might explain why it is so complex. Further it is in its twelfth revision, and over the years, its core audience has gotten so used to using it that the programmers have left out all the ""small steps"" that a newbie needs to be able to figure it out.There is no manual, and no ""Dummies-type guide"" for this stuff. Unless you are an accomplished musician, or audio engineer, don't even go near this one. That said, I'm sure that it is a very powerful program for what it does."
1,Bad Business,I returned this product after paying for it myself and was notified on the 28th of Decemeber that I was being refunded within 5 - 10 business days and still have not received my refund. I amy not ever deal with Amazon again and I will inform all of my contacts as well.
4,A benchmark for Marine Modelling,"This is a completely new approach to the rigging of ships for the wooden ship modeller. The author has done this by pictures alone. Page by page, step by step, rope by rope, a revolution in this type of instruction. Every page depicts a new, full page diagram on the rigging of ships.As far as this type of genre goes, I am yet to see a publication that can match this, and as such the new bench mark, instead of the usual tome of exhaustive text for people who have lived on boats their entire life.I have given it four stars as it is based on only one British ship. I can understand and appreciate the author's brilliance in his ability to filter down such a complex subject, but for the price, I would have liked to see a greater variance of ships and an inclusion of small boats, but this does not lessen nor detract from this books quality."
5,rigging period ship models,I ordered this book for my husband because he was working on one of those expensive wooden ship models and before he could get to the rigging part of the model (the hardest part) our dog (who loves to eat paper products) ate most of the instructions pertaining to the rigging. I believe this book will be what the doctor ordered.
2,Very confusing software,"I've worked with both video and music editing software, and this program is by far the most confusing and unintuitive I've ever used. It does not come with paper directions (just a pdf file) so finding help is difficult. I'm sure its great software for those that have a year or two to figure it out, but I will keep looking for better designed software."
3,Music Studio,I received this item in a timely matter. Having trobule figuring out how to use the Music Studio. Still working towards figuring it out.
1,Freezes,"This product froze even after uninstalling and reinstalling twice. The tech help could not be reached by phone or email. The manual is sparse, as are the official website. NOT RECOMENDED!"
5,Standard Cranium too easy? Here's the solution.,"The Cranium booster box is what the original game should have been: challenging and thoughtful. The designers clearly put their heads together for the new questions and it shows. We have all but stopped playing with the original cards because now we're actually getting stumped on the trivia cards and having more fun with the charades cards. NOTE: with the added difficulty the game becomes more challenging for kids. They may not find the booster pack as fun. Other items of interest: they've made the all-play (""club cranium"") easier to see on the cards and important words in the description are now in a bolded font. Small touches, big improvement. Highly recommended."
1,Needs an upper age limit attached!,"A group of twelve of us, between 40-50 years old, got together with great anticipation to play this new game. We quickly learned that it was not for our generation. The music was from our younger siblings' generation; The creative-drawing sculpting part was simplistic. The biggest problem though, was that the type on the cards is so small and so faint. Those of us that didn't have our ""drugstore"" reading glasses with us were out of luck! We are willing this game to the 30-somethings in our family."
3,Cranium overrated?,"While we were quite excited about the concept and the approach of Cranium, our experience was disappointing. It was challenging to draw picture without looking, but other than that, our group of four rarely missed a question and rarely needed more than twenty seconds to complete a challenge. The timer became extraneous, and the winning team was determined mainly by lucky roles of the die."
5,More Cranium To Love,"My friends and I love Cranium, so this gives us a good variety of cards. I'm going to need the second booster soon though."
5,Outstanding book for the many who ARE alone with their horse,"Mary Jean Vasiloff mentored me in my fledgling, developing breeding program as she wrote this book. It is a unique book in that the deeper aspects of ones relationship with the horse is addressed in a profound, sensitive and knowledgeable way. The instruction is very clear and useable and within reach of anyone of any level of horsemanship. Practical suggestions that go way beyond the ""classic"" pinky up horse advice make seemingly unsurmountable problems immediately solveable. The information is tried and true and no way comprises the integrity of the ""correct"" way of doing horse things. I think this book makes a great contribution to ""how-to"" horse literature. I received first hand guidance and support from MJV with my horses that was original, vastly knowledgeble, applicable and creatively thoughtful,and this book is like that.I wish the publishers would reissue this book because it is a timeless, invaluable resource, a classic."
5,A Common Sense Book for Those Who Want to Learn Correctly,"This author has been walking the walk, and quite successfully, for many years. She is worth listening to. I have been a horse owner for 50 years and I learned new ideas! Its a good book to learn from."
2,Not their best..,"this album is for fanatics only. However, I would recommend ""The Sidewinder Sessions"" to anyone. It contains some of their best work, and is a personal favorite. Fans should also seek out guitarist Rich Hopkins other projects (i.e. Los Luminarios)."
3,"Helpful, but confusing","This book has lots of useful information in it, but there are many places where the author uses unfamiliar terms and does not explain them."
4,"Wiley, wake up","Let me ignore what the text says, and focus instead on how Wiley chose to present it: using non-black ink. Brown. Lighter than it should be for good reading... every word of it. THAT is what greets the (aging) eye when you open the book. Is it supposed to remind us of brown bread, or what? Dumb.Wiley must have a checklist for book production, and I assume something near a papal dispensation must be required when choosing to forsake highly-legible black on white. This pope failed."
3,ok,It was what I expected. Came on time and in the condition descried. I needed this for school . It was kind of pointless to me though.
3,hmmmmm...,"Sixties pop music from local Minnesota dance bands. Will appeal to lovers of garage bands and those who ""grooved"" to this music on WDGY when it came out. There are a handful of fine performances (the Underbeats especially) and a couple of national hits (Surfin' Bird, Liar-Liar) but alot of it is amateurish and just plain dull. However, Little Latin Lupe Lu is KILLER, the best garage-band tune I've ever heard, and blows the doors off of Louie-Louie."
4,Great garage band examples,"Though some midwest garages can be ""cold"", especially in the winter, this complilation serves up some ""warming"" fare. The classic ""Surfin Bird"", by the Trashmen is here and a bouncy ""Run Run Run"" by the Gestures. The ""sleeper"" here is ""Ride On"" by the Torres...classic SOMA echo coupled with jangling ""Byrdsesque"" 12-String, solid bass line and driving drums...interesting stuff!"
4,A Beginner book,"I have the book for years. I bought it as it has the highest rating from reader review. As review it today, I would say it just good for someone want to start close up. It provide a lot of practical information for a starter. For a advance macro photographer, the information will becoem little and not details enought."
1,"Worthless, Outdated and Amateurish","This book should be taken out of print. It is unbelievably outdated and the creative viewpoint of the author is stale at best. I have an art degree and Shaw comes up lacking in composition, depth of field, backgrounds and subject positioning. His ""home-made"" equipment was a laugh and does not translate well to what is inexpensively available for modern cameras. Most of the photographs were average at best. I would not even recommend this to a beginner. In the same purchase, I received two of Tom Ang's books. Both of these are excellent, have strong creative suggestions and current information for the digital camera age. Look elsewhere for a photography book."
4,Stunning Photography,"If you have read John Shaw before, you will get a lot of the same information on apeture, shutterspeed, film speed, lenses, tripods, etc. However, the photographs in this book are amazing. Shaw's captions tell how he achieved them. It is a beautiful book, and very informative if this is your first read by John Shaw."
5,Closeups in Nature,"Despite not covering digital cameras this book covers all you need to know on closeup photography, it has many tips on achieving this, stacking lens, using long lenses, multipliers, bellow and movie lens. The sections on using flash are excellent and well written.In other words this book is for all to read from beginners in the closeup world to experienced photographers."
3,Nature photography,I loved the book except it is based on film photography and I now use digital exclusively. Many wonderful suggestions that still can be used.
5,An Outdated Classic. Not For Modern Photography.,"The book in it's day was a classic. John Shaw in all of his books has a special gift for writing concisely and the book has many great photographs. Besides the pictures and a few words of general photographic wisdom the book is completely out of date. The author has long ago moved on from manual flash, manual gear and film.Nice book for historical reading but don't buy into any of the gear as the author and the world has since moved on."
4,A Classic,"It is a must have if you take macro outdoor photographies. Basic things to specific acessories.The author doesn't talk about digital, but almost everything you know about film you can use in digital.A classic book!"
5,Woven Storage Baskets,"These baskets were much better in person but they were great in the pictures too. They are very rich looking. You wouldn't have to hide them in the pantry. They are much better for storage because of the straight sides. This also allows them to hold more. They are much bigger than I thought they would be, but not too big. I like the 3 different sizes and the nesting ability. The wood handles not only make them look good but make for easy handling. The baskets hold heavy items securely too. If you need storage baskets you will not be unhappy. I thought the price was really great especially for what I got."
2,Expensive Disappointment,"I'm disappointed because these headbands seemed to be just the thing I was wanting. They fit nicely, and don't bunch up. The problem is that I've had them for only a few weeks, and already the seams are falling apart. I thought vidal Sassoon would offer a higher quality product, since they're supposed to be the hair experts, but, not this time. I will not purchase Vidal Sassoon products again. The price is simply too high for a name brand, especially since the product is flimsy and poorly crafted. Too expensive for what it is. don't buy these."
2,Standard size,"Not as wide as they appear online. Same width as ones found in Target/Walgreens. Needed something wider for REALLY bad hair days. Already had these. If standard size is what you seek, these are perfect."
3,Engineers didn't think it thru...,"All in all, a good radio. We lost power during a bad storm and tried using. Unfortunately, when I cranked up the power and turned on the light, it shined directly into my face, rendering my light soaked pupils usless when navigating the radio dial."
1,No TV band,We had to return it because there was no TV audio band on the FR300. The one we received had AM/FM/Weather only. That was unfortunate because the radio was of excellent quality and sounded great for a small portable.
4,radio,"Sound quality is not great, and the knobs do seem flimsy. However, the reception is fine, and product works as described. I am overall happy with the purchase."
4,almost as nice as the FR200,it's not with out it's quarks but the key selling point is the wx feature. the tv bands are now useless. this is a very dated radio I still use it from time to time but for radio I use my FR200 more and use this for weather alerts. both are dated but they have lasted years when treated right.
3,Mostly Good: One Problem,FR300 Eton Radio - I use it daily for the morning news and weather. I had occasion three nights ago to use the Weather Alert function; that worked very well.One disappointment - I find I must rely primarily upon batteries for power. The hand-crank feature does not perform nearly as well as advertised. It takes a close to a full minute of cranking to get 4-5 minutes of operation. This clearly is not sufficient to use the hand-crank power feature to depend upon weather alert broadcasts throughout a stormy night.
5,Another Great Eton Product,"i bought the eton fr 300 to keep on standby in case of power outages. i have used this model quite a bit since i received it to test the reliability. it has a nice large speaker with excellent sound. the radio and weather stations all work well, the tuner is on the money. the light works good but would be better if it had a couple more led bulbs. the brightness is good but could be a little brighter. the crank feels sturdy. overall, this is a great radio that i would trust in case of an emergency."
1,Antenna,"I'm unable to say how this radio performs as the antenna broke at the base the first time that my husband attempted to use it. This same thing happened to the Grundig, earlier model that I bought for him the year before. This replacement proved to be equally disappointing. I have to add that he enjoyed the earlier model before the antenna broke."
4,Good for contingencies,"I received this radio as a gift, and I keep it handy in case there is an extended power outage, or severe weather coming through. We have a local radio station that tends to bleed out most other stations on the FM dial, but this is true with most analog tuning radios I have. The features seem like a perfect combination of what you would want for communications in an emergency.For those whose cell phones do not fit any of the included adapters, it is relatively easy to find a cheap used cell phone that does fit. In that case you could keep it with the radio for 911 calls, as that would not require activation with a cell carrier."
3,Works well,Everything works as advertised except for the cell phone charger. None of the adapters fit any of my phones. Being able to charge my cell phone during a power outage was the main reason I purchased this model. I should have bought the less expensive one. At least I can still listen to the news and weather.
3,THE CELL PHONE CORD AND TIPS DO NOT!!! COME IN BOX!,"I purchased this for the potential of being hit by Hurricane Dean and the major purchase consideration behind it being the ability to power my cell phone(s.) Come to find out they ONLY mail the tips now after registering the product. Their customer service was good - they're sending the cord and tip out expedited mail. Would I have purchased this again - yes. BUT if you're expecting to use it immediately after opening the box, be forewarned."
4,Nice little emergency radio,"I got this radio as a gift. I haven't had to use it in an emergency, but I have tried it out to make sure it works. Cranking the handle around about twenty times gives you approximately 10 minutes of listening to the radio at a moderate volume. The weather band is pretty neat to listen to. I tried the TV bands but didn't get much because of my rural location. Overall this is a nice radio to have tucked away in case we are without electricity for an extended period of time. Oh, by the way, the radio comes with several adaptors to fit various cell phones so that they can be recharged by cranking the handle around. Unfortunately, none of them fit my particular phone. I looked on the internet to see if I could buy one but haven't had any luck yet."
2,Not much for $50,I looked around at what was on the market. This unit looked good. I went with it over the Oregon Scientific products because I wanted to have a regular radio as well. First the unit is much poorer quality they you would expect by the brand name and pictures. It works OK but the design of the front panel controls is poor. I am always bumping on the light or some other function or bumping off some function. The front selection knobs stick out and move easily. I can not recommend another unit that has both weather and regular so I bought this one. Think carefully before you buy this unit.
3,Mistake in manual,"My biggest complaint with the radio is that the manual mistakenly promises over an hour of listening time for 60-90 seconds of cranking. You only get 10 minutes of listening time which would be fine for emergencies but you'll definitely need to run this on batteries for regular listenting. I called customer service three times to ask about this and never recieved a call back. Otherwise, a nice radio with very good reception."
5,Decent quality radio for the money. Definitely for emergency use and not much else.,"This is no hi-fi quality stereo system. It's an emergency radio, which is fairly durable, has nifty features like a flash light and siren, and can work both on batteries and from cranking. The sound is not going to dazzle anybody - once again, this is an emergency radio. Worth the money and certainly good to have."
3,"Seems OK, but....","Seems to work well as described in the instructions, but after a month I am still waiting for the free connection for charging my cell phone. Will have to recontact them which is annoying."
5,works great,"Cranking for 90 seconds gives you loads of power and the radio is compact so it packs well too.the only thing about this product that i'd change is the carry case, which is a little clumsy in design."
3,No weather band,Everything about this radio exceeded expectations except that the weather bands don't work.
3,WORKS FINE BUT....,"Eton FR300 Emergency Crank Radio Metallic RedWe lost power the other day and realized that we had no way to hear news. We have phones and could call someone but wanted to hear news about what was going on. We ordered this multi-function radio. All features work fine. However, in 2009, TV is going digital and the TV audio reception feature will no longer work. There are also plans to digitalize FM radio broadcasting at a later date. The digitilization of AM radio has also been proposed for an even later date. At that point, this radio will be a battery/hand cranked siren/flashlight/weather radio. But then again, are they planning to digitilize the weather broadcasts too? I spent the $50 anyway. It will at least hold us for a few years."
3,Did Not Work,"The first time we received this product, it worked fine. Great to use when power fails. So, we gave it as a gift for Christmas. It did not work. We paid postage AGAIN to send it back and have to wait 6 weeks to see whether the replacement will work. Not happy at the moment."
4,Bought 3 for Christmas gifts last year,"We live in Florida and I bought these for my family members in case we were out of power. We know the value of getting information immediately and these radio's give us that. Fortunately, we haven't had to use the emergency features on them this year, but that's a good thing."
1,Crank doesn't work for very long,"I purchased this, and used the crank steadily for 5 days, about 8 hours a day up at my cabin. On the 5th day, I had to crank for 2.5 minutes to get 45 minutes of playing. It's been getting less and less as I go along. I am really not happy w/ this product, since I bought it exclusively for the crank. If you're buying it for that reason, don't buy it."
2,What is left unsaid,Neither Amazon nor Eton mention that the TV1 and TV2 channels will go silent after February 2009.
2,Non-durable,Yes I like the AM reception-- But after using the Eton Fr-300 for thre months. The hand crank generator failed. With an inspection internally I found it was due to a Plastic reduction gear. Untill that point and time I was happy with it.I was disappointed to find the Cell phone adapters fit only a very few phones. So I did not get a chance to try that feature.with my kyocera phone.I would suggest if you want to be emergency ready with this radio. To looking for the Solar adaptor from c.crane radio.com.But myself I have not been very happy with how long the hand crank lasted before it failed.But when it was working. I was able to get over 24 hours of playing. After I cranked the radio for 30 minutes. If I cranked it for 15 minutes. The radio would play for 8 hours.
3,Lasted a couple of weeks,It arrived on time i set it up which wasnt hard and began listening to a nice sounding tone. A few weeks later it would not turn on and havent heard anything from it since. Right now it is back where i bought it and i still have no radio.
1,Eton -- Certainly eatin' the batteries,"I have a little red Eton (not sure about the model; it's not on the machine), and it is inadequate: 1. aaa batteries don't last long at all. 2. the solar charger, after being in the sun all day, powered the radio for about 15 minutes. 3. hand-cranking the thing powers it for only a few minutes. My previous Eton, which suffered some of the same flaws, played on aa batteries for weeks; I rue the day I gave it away."
5,Great Purchase,Everything was as presented. Excellent product as described and shipping was great.. Would recommend this merchant to anyone that has need of their products.
3,So-so quality but good for emergency use,"The first one I received was defective, but thanks to Amazon's awesome return procedures, I got a replacement in only a few days. The radio sound is tinny, not a product I would use except for emergencies, but that's why I got it. The hand crank works well to power the radio, so batteries are not required. I'm glad I bought it."
1,Stopped working within 18 months,Everything about this radio is solid for the price but it has relatively lousy reception. I live in FL so I will keep it for the next hurricane. (handcrank feature) If I needed it daily i would have had to return it. Adddendum: It stopped working 18 months later.
4,Pretty Good,I expected to have the TV channels but I guess they may have changed to product due to the conversion to digital broadcasting. I really wanted the cell phone charger which you send for after designating your cell make and model.
2,eton radio,switches are sloppy and difficult to set where you want them. Quality is not what I expected. There are better radios out there !
2,One feature broken,"The radio worked, but the built-in flashlight did not. Called Elton and the only fix was to mail back to them for repair, which I did not do. Disappointed that it was defective when received."
1,JUNK - DO NOT BUY,"THIS RADIO IS SO CHEAPLY MADE IT IS NOT WORTH HALF THE PRICE. THE KNOBS ARE SO CHEAP I ALMOST BROKE ONE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT . THE TV STATIONS DO NOT COME IN WELL. WORSE THEN THAT THE NOAA WEATHER STATIONS CAME IN ONCE AND NEVER AGAIN. YOU ALSO CANT TELL IF THE CRANK UP ELECTRICITY IS WORKING UNLESS YOU PUT DEAD BATTERIES IN IT( I THINK AS I HAVE NOT DONE THIS ). IF YOU WANT A QUALITY WEATHER RADIO BUY ONE FROM MIDLAND , THEY ALSO COME WITH EMERGENCY ALERT FEATURE ON SOME MODELS"
4,Eton FR300 Emergency Crank Radio,"I purchased the Eton FR300 for my mother who lives in Puerto Rico. I happen to be with her when Hurricane Irene hit the Island. If it weren't for this radio, we would not be able to obtain any information about electricity and water. We were without power for 5 days and the Eton held up. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't possible to charge my cell phone with the adapters provided. The adaptors provided are already obsolete with the current technology associated with the cell phones now on the market. Other that the Eton Emergency Radio performed excellently throughout the storm."
2,Defeats itself,"The main reason I got this radio was because it was a Windup Radio. One minute of winding got me about 10 minutes of Radio time. Now, the battery won't even hold five minutes of Radio time. For $50's I would have expected a whole lot more. Everything else works fine, except for the fact that you can't rely on it in an emergency unless you get someone to constantly wind it for you - but that's not very realistic.Pro: Radio receptionRadio fine tune dialPreset Weather ChannelsCon: No battery lifeLED light is too weak to do anything realistic withYou must 'send in' for your cell phone charger - which I haven't gotten still one month later."
3,No Charger?,"Radio works fine...a little weak on signal, but it'll do in the city. I can't believe it's offered without a charger and really can't believe how much the charger was to buy separate (plus another shipping charge). Yea, yea, I read that it didn't come with a charger, I just thought I'd crank it and that would be enough. BUY THE CHARGER. I'll need the adrenaline of an oncoming Oklahoma tornado to crank that thing enough."
2,LESS THAN GREAT,"The second time I ever used this radio the Weather Band had evidently stopped working. Not sure if the switch malfunctioned or if the radio itself malfunctioned, but either way it ended up being a waste of money since the weather band function was what I bought it for in the first place. The thing's buttons feel really cheap in your hands. At least the AM/FM portion of the radio still works alright, for now.. Anybody want to buy a broken Eton radio for cheaper than they sell them broken from right out of the box?? <crickets>"
5,"Perfect for emergencies, or the beach","It's water-resistant and doesn't need batteries, runs on a hand crank, weighs nothing, and is much smaller than I expected - perfect for our in-case-of-evacuation bag (we live in fire and earthquake zones), but probably also great for the beach.The lack of AC adapter makes sense. You'll want to use something else if you're near a working AC outlet, anyway. It does charge my cell phone, so it'd be good for camping, too. And the NOAA-fired alert light makes it a good find for emergencies or being lost."
1,JUNK !!!,"I bought this radio on 12/13/07. I tried it when I received it & it worked OK. I took it camping (pop-up) & when I needed to get a weather report (9/2/08), the weather band was completely non-functional !!!! Of course, we had heavy rain & thunderstorms that night !What good is a so-called emergency radio that doesn't work the 1st time you need it ?I'm glad I bought the AC adapter because 15 minutes of cranking gave about 1 minute of radio use !I wasted $50 on a piece of electronic junk ! I hope I can buy something else that is dependable & actually works when you need it !I also never received the cell phone adapters from Eton after sending them the request card !Don't buy this item !"
3,Great for Emergencies-not good for everyday usage,"This radio is a very valuable item when an emergency arises.It has a built in flashlight. It has a built in RED flasher for road emergencies . It has a cell phone charger which works on many cell phones not all. The radio section is surprisingly good especially the AM. This is NOT however a good radio for everyday usage . The control knobs are not made very well and will break if you use it everyday ....its made for an emergency, only! The additon of TV and Weather ( minus SW) was a clever move since in an emergency you most likely want to hear those stations.It comes with nice carrying case for protection but the radio itself is not a very sturdy item . In an emergency you might give this radio 10 stars. For everyday , not so good. I would buy it and store it away for a rainy day."
4,No problems after a years worth of use.,"I should say that the unit did have a bad pressure switch on arrival but CH got that rectified quickly. Since, the initial problem there haven't been any and it has worked as expected. I have it in my hobby shop and it easily keeps with anything and everything I do. I have heavy air consumption tools and it has no problem keeping up, it could handle 2-3 times what I do and still keep up LOL.This unit makes single stage, 60 gallon compressors sold at the BORG look and perform like toys. ;-)"
2,No control,"I have a TC Under Bust and love it so wanted to give this camisole a try. While it is made of quality soft material, it did not have same kind of firm compression and shaping the under bust camisole does. Basically made no difference. I bought 34. I am 34 c, wear size 10 top and 4 or 6 pants."
1,Didn't hold in anything,"I ordered this after reading the reviews - I have a poouch from having a baby 23months ago and I thought it might pull it is a bit but it didn't at all! NOTHING. It was just as if I was wearing an overpriced tank top. I ended up finding one at target for 1/4 of the price that works AH-MAZING!I do have to say though that the company Bare Necessities that this product was sent from, was great! The product came quickly and the return was a cinch. I would order from the company again as it was easy, quick and painless."
3,okay,"This is okay, nothing great. I had twins and wanted something to hold in more of my tummy but this really didn't do that great of a job. I certainly couldn't wear this alone without a sweater or sweatshirt over it. It's not very comfortable either. There's this hardish elastic in the bra part that's less than comfortable.If you need a tank top anyway, then maybe get this since it possibly provides a little tiny insy bit of help but don't get it if you're looking for a control top."
3,"Impressive, but not great","I had heard about this novel months ago, and waited with great excitement for publication in a trade paperback format. Having read this novel, I'd like to make some comments.Plot? Loosely plotted and in places, endlessly discursive. The 'fragments' of the story add up, but by the time you have ended this novel, you frankly don't care. Let me also say that each fragment is very interesting and by themselves, they make interesting little stories. As a novel...?Influences? I read big undigested hunks of Sheri Tepper (the religious obsessions of the societies and the treatment of women), Jack Vance (the complexity of the societies and the genial cynicism of the story itself), and perhaps some of the influences of 'golden age scifi authors' such as Jack Williamson.Does it work? Maybe. Would most scifi readers enjoy it? If they pay attention to the plotlines.I'm curious to see his other two novels, not yet published in English."
5,I envy anyone who hasn't yet read this great book!,"i kept hearing how awesome this book was and it left no disappointments whatsoever. I never saw where it was going, and neither will anyone who hasn't had it spoiled ahead for them. Whatever you do DON'T let anyone tell you the ending ahead of time. I loved this book, a rare and fantastic find."
3,Straightforward,"I got this book because my grandfather served with the 41st, and I wanted a glimpse into the life he must have led while a supply sergeant in WWII. The book is simple memoir with no bells and whistles, but you have to love the author's sincerity (and sweetness of spirit) in the way he tells his unvarnished tale. I can't say I gained any great insights, but I was excited to find reference to an incident that my grandfather talked about many times: taking friendly fire from a B-25."
2,"Boring, boring, boring","Well intentioned, but nothing of interest. Written for his grandchildren, the story is sanitized. Even worse, the author had the fortune, or misfortune, to participate in some of the lowest cost assaults of the war. Joining after Buna as an infantry replacement, the author lands at Hollandia. Biak was ugly but nothing seems to happen. The division misses Leyte and Luzon, landing instead to clean out the southern Philippines. As far as the wave of personal war memoirs goes this isn't the worst, but compared to With The Old Breed, it is for your Fifth Grader."
2,kc,VERY CHEAPLY MADE . Contents taped on inside caused damage to window inside limo . Doors very flimsy
2,WHAT THE...?!?!,"that doll doesnt look like her at all! she isnt a redhead shes blond. well, now she has black hair... but it just doesnt look like her. if they wanted that doll to look like her, shed need other styled heads and a new wardrobe. she doesnt wear skirts like that."
5,Excellent storytelling by a Native American Seneca Author,"This book is written by a Native American Seneca Indian and is compiled of stories passed on by Grandmothers and Grandfathers. His style is exciting and leaves the reader shuddering at times. One can almost imagine being right there and listening to the old ""Storyteller"" spin his tales of the supernatural. There is a uniqueness in the way they are presented especially in the colloquial form in which they were originally presented to the Author. So if you enjoy the supernatural and like tales that have been passed on for generations, you will enjoy this book and you may just have to read and re-read it."
3,Be prepared! Get a Frame with brackets on top/bottom! Good Buy!,"We bought this and had to get a bedframe that allowed us to connect the canopy to the bottom and top, so don't get an ajustable frame unless it has the rails. Otherwise it was pretty easy to put together and my 10 yr old loved it!"
2,Not worth it,"Put the bed together properly, but screws would not stay tight. The support in the middle snapped in half after about a month of use. Canopy rail fell down on my head one night after the screw fell out."
2,not the best purchase,"First of all, all of the screws were not even in a bag and they were scattered all throughout the box. The box had a hole in it and many of the screws were missing. The directions for assembly suck! It was just a labeled picture that had been torn in the box and was missing a chunk of the page. I don't suggest that you buy this bed unless you have a lot of patience and can figure out assembly from just a picture. Plus be ready to take a trip to the hardware store to buy any screws you may be missing"
4,I like it,"I like it, order it here and arrived pretty fast. The assembly was fairly easy, was kind of shaking, but once attached to my bottom bed frame, was perfect. Some screws needs to work it out in order to fit in, but over all, it was good. I love the look after I put the curtains around, very romantic."
3,Good product BUT!!!!!,Product shipped to me was suppose to be a queen however was full size when I opened month later.... unhappy!!!
3,Nice but....,I am late writing this review as it was purchased in 2008. The bed looks like but it's as sturdy as you would expect and also the rounded design of the posts scratched up my walls. The metal bent as we were putting it to gether but wasn't too noticible after construction. My main complaint is that it ruined the paint job on my walls. Maybe if you didn't put it directly on the wall it would help but that wasnt an option for me. I did use this frame for about 2 years though before i got tired of it. Also I will add this was AFTER I took the canopy rails down and used it as a regular bed. I had no scratching issues with the canopy design.** I also paid 200 dollars for it so for the price now I'd say it's definitely worth it.
3,Very difficult to assemble! Pretty but not sturdy.,"So I saw this and thought it would go great with the canopy I had bought already on Amazon. After paying 50$ for shipping I was very disappointed to open the package and just have metal rods and vague instructions. With the help of two strong male friends and some metal pounding and bending, the poorly constructed pieces finally fit together. It looks nice with the canopy but it is still a little shaky so I have to be careful when touching it and I can't put any weight on it. Other than being poorly made it is nice to look at. I wouldn't say it is a waste of money but it definitely isn't for people who don't like assembling things."
4,great looking bed,"you must get a frame that connects both the bottom and top it was my fault that i didn't read the reviews first,otherwise this is a great bed I love it and I'm 50 yrs old."
2,Pretty but flimsy,"It looks really nice but the balls on top wont screw in straight, the whole thing shakes pretty bad and bends easily. Also, it makes a LOT of noise when your...you know..."
1,Horrible,"Let's get one thing straight. This product looks like it came from a pawn shop. The tops of the bed post are bent, parts are missing, and the product is also scratched. When I called the company phone number provided, it was someone's cell phone and he said he was to busy, so asked me to call him back. I called back later and the guy told me tough luck... DO NOT BUY!!!!!!"
4,Great Bed,"I hesitated about purchasing this bed because I was afraid it would be cheap looking and unstable. Decided to get it and just use it temporarily. Got it set up...little challenging, but only because I'm not use to assembling anything :), but was pleasantly surprised when it was finished. Very sturdy, looks awesome, and I am keeping it. If anyone is considering this....get it. You will not be dissapointed...the price alone. Definitely get the frame that is suggested with this...think its from another company."
5,"Do Not Fear ""Some Assembly Required""","I love my bed. When I first opened the box to put it together, and began pulling out all sorts of poles and bars, I got nervous. However, as long as you remember that the Sunburst pattern with the bent bottom GOES AT THE FOOT of the bed and is SHORTER than the headboard (the standing poles have 3 holes into which you push the bars from the headboard/footboard - one set of poles has holes higher than the other set) you're fine.It was pretty simple to put together, and it looks great, particularly with the bedframe that was suggested by amazon and the netting I put over the top.I am still unsure if/how it can attach to the bedframe itself(i don't think it does), but it seems to be unnecessary. I am so pleased with this purchase and the outstanding price that I just ordered the matching bookshelf, and my friend in an apartment down the way who saw it post-assembly will be ordering one of these herself this weekend.Siante, and Happy St. Paddy's Day!!"
5,A Classic,"Great relaxing, loungy, beaty tunes. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Pizzicato Five, and any artist on the Sushi 3003 CD which is also great. Tomoyuki Tanaka is too cool!"
4,Pizzicato 5 fans: read this,"If you can't wait for the next Pizzicato 5 album, check out this CD. It is every bit as fun, dizzily melodic, and post-modern savvy as the best that P-5 has to offer. Most of it is pretty beat-heavy, but the hooks are never lost in the mix. The sound is drawn mainly from synthesizers and samples, so the grooves can be sterile. Still, it's all in the spirit of a groovy good time. Try it; i don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,"Good, but I expected better","This Fantastic Plastic Machine CD is a good one, I think it's much better than the ""Luxury"" CD. If you're new to the whole ""loungy"" music thing.... Welcome! It's a good world out there. Usually with these types of songs, either they are good or they're bad. Either one. Nice to say that most of the songs on the disc are good. However, the Fantastic Plastic Machine isn't nearly as good when compared to the great Pizzicato Five. It's in the area, but for some reason... I don't think I'm going to be listening to this CD as much as Pizzicato Five's releases. Maybe it's just me... My favorites are L'aventure Fantastique, Dear Mr.Salesman and Steppin out. This CD is definitely something the fans of this type of music can get into. I think mainstream music listeners may struggle to like."
4,Fun,"I really enjoyed this album. Despite the cutesy beats, and at times over done vocals, it is definetly a solid album."
1,Talk about false advertising...,"This band is neither plastic, nor fantastic. I could make better music with a couple rubber bands, an empty coffee can, and a stick. I advise anyone thinking of buying this CD to think again."
4,You're in for a treat.. this is good stuff,"I've been trying to learn more about the founding fathers of our great nation and most books are quite negative about John Adams. This book is not only fair and balanced about Mr. Adams, it also opened my eyes to John Adams' book that most people have never studied or heard about. I have put that book, ""A defence of the Constitutions of Government of the USA"", on my amazon wishlist and I am looking forward to diving into it next. I think that is the true sign of a great book and author, one who makes you want to study deeper into the subject matter. In summary, a great book, not easy to read, but an entertaining look into a misunderstood president."
4,Serves its purpose,"I knit and blog about my creations, so I needed something to display my knitted hats.I found this very inexpensive manequin foam head for a great price on Amazon. The head serves its purpose. However, there are a few minor flaws to consider. First, the head seems smaller than your average dome. It is also very, very light, so putting anything elaborate or unbalanced on top of it will make it topple over. Something heavy attached to the base would help."
3,"Decent quality, came damaged","I needed a mannequin head for taking pictures. This head looks good enough, and was reasonably priced. However, 3rd power shipped it in a box with zero bubble wrap or anything to hold it in place. It's made of just Styrofoam so when it arrived there were noticeable blotches and dents where it had probably rattled against the box during shipping.Note: there's also a noticeable line running vertically down the middle of the mannequin. They show it in the picture so I can't complain too much, but I hadn't spotted it. It's very visible if you use the mannequin for picture taking.I got most of the blotches, and the line out with sandpaper. I've gotten my use out of the mannequin, just frustrated I had to deal with the dents."
5,head,Using it for business purposes and it works great!!!All kinds of things can fit on it~~~I use it for hats others use it for scarves~~what would you use it for?
3,Smaller then expected,This is quite a bit smaller then an actual human head. I'm pretty sure I have a big head but this is really tiny. Just keep in mind if you order one of these you may have to bulk it up if you're going to use it for designing anything for your head.
4,Not the 'feel good movie of the year',"Not only does Fallen Angels tell a story, giving each character a developmental turn in the spotlight, but it sets the mood to be carried throughout the film. This movie is real and intimate. I was left feeling cold most of the time. It seems that, even though there are strong emotional scenes, most of the characters also recognize the coolness of the world surrounding their niche in society. Sometimes there are smiles, but no happiness. A well-developed, produced, acted, edited and written piece of art."
1,Wong Kar-wai: He So Crazy.,"Like an overzealous gourmand of the French New Wave Wong Kar-wai has greedily shoved down his cinematic gullet the worst examples of Godardian excess and has been forcedly regurgitating it in movie after movie ever since. Now, I've never been to Hong Kong but I have more than a vague feeling that Hong Kong T.V. ads probably look a lot like Wong Kar-wai movies: brooding Orientals wallowing in overbearingly dated French-chic.If all there is to making movies is conjuring up a couple of wacky characters doing wacky things for no rhyme or reason then I guess anyone could do it. Strike that. Only Wong Kar-wai is this contrived. Let's just hope his own worthlessness finally dawns on him before he vomits up more bad ideas."
1,The end of the road for this type of filmmaking,Style over substance sums it up . . . color instead of drama. . . kinetic shooting scenes instead of characters. . . silent and devoid of humans. peopled with one dimensional robots. You can safely skip this movie.
2,This is not a 4 or 5 star movie,"I rented this movie on the basis of the rating, you don't get the read the reviews on the blu-ray, what a mistake that was. I actually watched the entire movie, if you can call it that. From the at-a-glance I had thought it was about a hit-man and choices he had to make, but as far as I can tell it is about a few mentally/emotionally challenged people. This entire film is disjointed and jumps from character to character, it has no sense of time, or sense of direction, there is more narration than dialog. You will continually ask yourself what is this movie about, it is not a work of cinematic art. There are so many out of focus scenes you might think you need glasses, it's seems like a bunch of unrelated scenes were spliced together in no particular order. As someone else said the only thing mildly interesting in this movie were the two, fully clothed, female masturbation scenes. Really not a movie to be praised, there is nothing to see here, please move along."
5,Auflösung des Lebens in Farbe und Form,"Wong Kar-Wais Stadtvision. Der Mensch der Zukunft. Die Reduktion des Lebens, das Aufbegehren des Lebens. In diesem Film geht Wong Kar-Wai zurück zu den Grundfragen. Mag er manchmal auch zu programmatisch erscheinen, der Film entsetzt durch die unmittelbare Nähe von Kälte, Liebe, Entfremdung, Tod, durch die bis ins kleinste Detail stimmige Umsetzung von Prinzipien in Typen, die dann doch sehr individuell erscheinen. Der FIlm wimmelt von Augenwürmern, Lieblingsgestalten, Traumbildern. Immer wieder beeindruckend die Kombination der treffenden Wiedergabe HKs, der Schaffung einer Bildsprache für diese Stadt, mit ganz klassischen Formen des Aufbaus, der Figurenkonzeption, die europäischen Ursprungs sind. Ich liebe diesen Film, wie alle anderen von WKW. Fallen Angels scheint mir am perfektesten, und das ist wahrscheinlich das Einzige, was an ihm stört."
5,"15 years later, still a masterpiece!","I first watched this in 1997 and thought it was pretty good but it wasn't until the second viewing some 4 or 5 years later did it skyrocket to the list of my all time favorite movies. I can't rave enough about the cinematography. It is so stylish, so raw, so realistic, so cool. While time and repeated viewings have greatly lessened its effects on me, I still appreciate the supremely memorable and interesting characters you'll meet in this movie. The music too, oozes style. Edgy, moody, temporal. Add a good dose of ingenious fashion/costume design and the entire thing feels like one of those very rare finds you end up treasuring for life."
5,The best use of celluloid in the 1990's,"Wong Kar-Wai's ""Fallen Angels"" is visually grabbing and emotionally powerful. If you have been brain-washed to accept the garbage Hollywood puts out every week, then you will be mesmerized and blown away by what a real director can do. WKW is unmatched by any Western director for his ability to photograph the human soul. See this film. Don't miss it."
5,English DUB?,first off this movie is excellent. wong kar-wai is a genious. and puts art back into the filmaking process. and second off THIS IS NOT AN ENLISH LANGUAGE DVD. according to Nicholas Mulligan of Kino International Corp.
3,A lot of deph to it,You will be impressed with this movie if you enjoy being taken off into a new fantasy. The acting is very authentic and the plot is not predictable.
2,I loved Chung King Express but...,"Wow, I almost turned this one off several times. Very boring. It's basically Chung King Express done poorly. There are a few interesting camera angles, but they don't make up for the material (or lack thereof). If someone compressed this movie into 40 minutes you wouldn't be missing anything - and you might enjoy it more. I was looking forward to seeing this since Chung King Express is one of my favorite movies - but after seeing it I am very disappointed."
3,Stunning cinema,"Absolutely beautiful piece of film-making, full of some of the best cinematography you will ever see, along with thought-provoking moody introspection on the alienation of the modern world. Such a shame that the DVD, currently the only DVD release of the movie in the world, is absolutely horrible. The picture is washed out and pixellated, killing the cinematography, and the sound is a dull mono. My UK PAL VHS looks and sounds better :("
5,One of the most sexy films I've ever seen from Asia.,"Was Wong kar wai inspired by Freud's theory of infant's oral stage? It seems like there are a lot of oral activities going on through out the whole film- smoking, drinking, eating,etc. Good selection of music for soundtrack. If I would have to categorize this film, I would say it is an experimental romantic comedy with a splash of Hong Kong style action. I also recomend you to see Chunking Express, if you haven't. The story lines from both films are related,if not, the dialogues are."
2,oster reflecting id tag,"Item is too small to write any info in. Not worth the price. Also, seller was a rip off."
1,Disappointed,I thought the first review was just a fluke with the fact that two mermaids were delivered. I too received two sets of mermaids. I'm sure it will not make a difference to my daughter but it is not what was advertised or expected.
2,Not as advertised,"I also recieved two sets of mermaids. The clothes don't fit mermaids as well so really the whole gift is compromised. But because it is so close to Christmas and I doubt you can return just half of the item, I guess I am stuck."
3,Just Got 2 Sets & They're ALL Mermaids!,"While they're cute & all, I was planning on giving each of my girls a set of fairies & a set of mermaids, but I got ALL mermaids. Not even one set of fairies in either of my orders. Given that I got them at such a great price, I'll use the extras for birthday gifts, but they REALLY need to change the description of this item."
2,half of my order was wrong,well it was suppose to be 2 mermaids and 2 fairies but I received2 sets of mermaids instead.I cant return them because it is too close to Christmas and my daughters have their hearts set on them
5,Sifl and Olly FOR THE WIN.,"I just recently found out about Sifl and Olly. (When the show originally aired, I didn't have cable.[Not to mention, I was younger then, and probably wouldn't have gotten the humour quite well.])Well, anyways, after I saw a video of it on YouTube...I fell in love?No, maybe that's not the right phrase...How about...I really liked it?That doesn't do it justice.Well, yeah.It's really super-special-awesome.Yeah."
5,Best show ever,"This is by far the best show MTV ever made and my favorite show period. it was consistently the highest rated show in its time slot when it originally aired, but the suits at MTV didn't promote it and for some unknown reason kept moving it around and eventually made them include music videos in the episodes. we neeeeeeed this on dvd. or vhs, or betamax, i don't care. i just need a clean copy."
3,What happened to this group,"I vaguely remember when they came out but they do have to classic songs on this CD, which caused me to purchase it a few weeks ago. Changes and So high are worth the price, everything else is garbage."
3,I only had to go through about 7669 CDs to find this,"Competent if not amazing R&B/hip-hop girl group. Nothing really special here, but nothing bad either, and the slow jam ""Changes"" is pretty cool."
3,7669 similar in style to Total,"yes this album has adult material on it as stated by the warning stick on the label...however it is not a Lil'kim or Foxy brown cd. They were on motown, hence no promotion. The is cd has r&b;, rap, and rock. if you like Total you'll like this cd.best songs.king size bedso highchangescloud 69joy"
4,Nice bag,"I bought this bag for my niece a couple of years ago. She liked Baby Phat back then and it was a nice size bag for her gym clothes and any books or anything she needed to through over her shoulder. It was cute and not to ""kidd-ish"" A good buy for a teen."
2,Prosaic,"This very slim volume has even slimmer content that has little to do with the 'flaneur' proposition as it is commonly understood.The author writes a kind of autopilot 'prose' which dutifully recites history, names dates and places, and adds currency through incorporating dinner party gossip.For arguably the world's most aesthetic city, he has not a single poetic metaphor or observation to spare on Paris as built monument to culture or urban nexus.Not surprisingly, the truly great book on the flaneur in Paris is not even cited in his brief bibliography: Julian Green's ""Paris"". A random page of Green will provide the shivers of recognition and insight that this feeble effort sadly lacks.Thud. 2 stars because it can be bought for a penny used, is portable and, after a page or two of boredom, tossable.Les francais diraient que l'auteur est deja epuise."
4,This is the book to bring to Paris,"Before leaving home one should read ""Paris, The Biography of a City"" by Colin Jones and when the trip is over, digest your visit with ""Paris"" by Julian Green.""The Flaneur,"" however, is the best of the three and the one you will want with you as you wander the streets. At first blush the book appears to be intellectual flaneurie, but in fact the sections are broken down into fairly regimented units. They are roughly: Americans in Paris, the African American expereince, Jewish Paris, Gay Paris, Royalist Paris, all seen through a historical lens with lots of breezy, anecdotal filler. Plenty of history to round out the edges too. Ironically, it will leave readers a full agenda of places to visit as opposed to just ""aimlessly wandering"" which the actual flaneurs are want to do. Worth if for the descriptions of the less popular museums alone."
3,"""That aimless stroller who loses himself in the crowd""","""And no wonder Paris, land of novelty and distraction, is the great city of the flneur - that aimless stroller who loses himself in the crowd, who has no destination and goes wherever caprice or curiosity dictates his or her steps.""What is there to say about Paris that has not already been said? Ask any person on the street and he will tell you Paris is the best. And the worst. Alive. And dying. But when one is asked to write about Paris, one must. And thus this book. White uses the pages of this slim book to do this, to tell once again how Paris is the best and the worst and alive and dying."
3,a missed opportunity,"White is an excellent, insightful writer. A book by him talking about the Parisian tradition of the flaneur, first explored by Walter Benjamin in his essay ""Paris, the capital of the 19th century"" would have been welcome: it would have updated Benjamin's work (now about 70 years old) and it would have brought a fresh American perspective to it. This isn't quite it. There are some relevant passages in this short book, but White is far mosre interested in the other visitors to Paris than in the city as an entity. Mention of the city's singular places rarely rises above guide-book standard. A shame."
3,Reader as outsider?,"White gives some elegantly written historical insights into the monuments of Paris. The compact format of this book makes it a handy companion on a trip to the City of Light. I must admit with some consternation, however, that my attention began to flag as White seemed to focus more and more narrowly on the gay perspective. I couldn't escape the feeling that as we meandered along the Paris streets, there was a conversation taking place in which I was an unwelcome hanger-on. My problem, I guess. This would be a completely delightful book for those more interested in the gay point of view."
2,Not completely what it seems,"This is not your charming, harmless, Hemingway-like account of a flaneur in Paris as you imagine by the cover and title. While it will satisfy some of your cravings of the Paris athmosphere as you read it, its buildings and neighborhoods, it shows so much of the subjectibility or the writer that I didn't feel like continuing to read it. I don't mind what he is but, he too much focuses on that (also showing the reader some of the writer's own prejudices), it comes as a surprise while you read the book and out of context. At least he should have titled the book ""The flaneur"" promenades on Paris. I only would like to know better what I buy before I buy it. It deceived me. It ruined what could have been a splendid book."
5,satisfied,My kids and I love scooby.I grew up watching scooby. So yeah we'll really enjoy it. Eventually we'll get more.Thank you.
3,Scooby Doo and the Goblin King,"The condition of the movie is poor, has many scratches and freezes up. Wish it was as good of quality as stated when I purchased it."
2,Sadly diappointing,"SO many have already said that this movie is disappointing because the rest of the gang is not really in it, just at the beginning and end. It is TOTALLY halloween, so it's very seasonal. It is another of the ""real"" movies like Witch's Ghost and Zombie Island. Not my favorites, as that alone missed the whole POINT of Scooby Doo! It's too scary for the littlest ones and the older kids were bored with it. The thread of the story gets lost as they try to incorporate everything ever connected with halloween. It jumps around so much that you are never sure what exactly it was that you are supposed to be hoping happens! We watched it once, but I doubt we will ever watch it again. My vote, as an adult, is pass on this one. It's not clever at all, which is surprising given the cast (the reason I took a chance on it), no fun dialogue, no characters to cheer for, just plain BORING and flat. Sorry!"
1,"Sounds like ""Scooby meets Bettlejuice"".","Our family has stayed away from the new Scooby movies that are to fantastic. In ""Zombie Island""- The zombies are portrayed as real. In ""Alien Ivaiders""- There are ""good"" aliens that help the gang, that are portrayed to be real. In ""The Witch's Ghost""- There are real witches and wiccan practices are discussed.Judging by Amazon's discription we will pass on this new offering. I'm not to cool with my five year old going on a trip thru the afterlife with a magic broom, real fairys, and real gobblin kings.We have always stuck with the episodes and movies that feature the entire gang and are ture to the original story lines."
5,Scooby-doo and The Goblin King,"I was so tickeled to find this movie, since it is one of the few I didn't know about...I have been collecting Scooby-doo movies for quite some time. The cost was low and the product arrived in perfect condition, as all I have ordered thus far. Thanks Amazon !"
4,scooby-doo the goblin king,IT'S A NEW SCOOBY-DOO MOVIEIT'S A TREAT FOR THE FANS.byrd_elaine@yahoo.com
4,Good Viewing,"Great for family viewing, if only todaya cartoons weren't so ""preachy"", with all of their ""moral"" overtones. I love Scooby, for the fun, and adventure."
4,Scooby Doo is the best!,Who can pass up Scooby Doo? Have been a fan for years and enjoy watching Scooby Doo with our grandchildren!
1,Worst Scooby movie,"This movie is worse than the music of vampire. Why is this in the top 15 scooby movies today? This is hardely a mystery. Avoid this movie, it is horrible. This is no scooby movie"
3,More questy less mystery,"If you are an original hard core Scooby fan you might not like this movie. I tend to appreciate the mystery in Scooby Doo. There was no mystery it was a quest movie. The plot was a tad jumpy, it did have some good humor. I didn't really care for this one too much because throughout the movie I became bored. It seemed to drag in some parts and others it seemed like you were waiting for something to happen that just never did. On the other hand my 3 year old loved it. It didn't scare her, she was amused throughout the movie, and in three days wanted to go for her third viewing today. In short this movie is kid but not adult friendly, with a storyline which is not as true to form as the originals."
1,I don't think they really have it.,"I ordered one a while ago, they sent a pepper mill. Ordered another one recently - another pepper mill. Sent it back for exchange - pepper again. Besides having a ""P"" on top and being filled with pepper, this also has a different mechanism than the salt mill. I notice that the model number for salt is SP5515SS while the pepper is SS5515SS so maybe they have them swapped."
4,Good blades,As usual these are good blades for fine fret work. They leave a cleaner edge and consequently less clean-up is required. I've used them for many years and would recommend them for intermediate to advanced scrollers.
1,weak blades,"I admit that I use my scroll saw a lot, and can go through these tiny spiral blades like crazy. However, I usually break a saw blade no more than once a day...these blades I ordered are so weak, I break one about every 30 minutes!!!I will be searching for a better brand when I run out of these, (which at this rate, won't be long!)."
5,Great remix single!,"This is a great CD single. This is a very nice remix of ""Request Line"" by Zhane featuring rapper Queen Latifah. The single also includes the LP Version. Zhane's vocals are so smooth and blend very nicely. The song has soothing R&B mixed with hip hop and rap vocals from Queen Latifah, who does a nice job and adds some flavor to the song, spicing up the remix. This special remix is only available on this here single. If you like remixes, then I'd recommend you get this!"
2,Interesting idea but no cigar,"This ""shotgun-like"" super soak works well at close range. But it won't win a spitting contest! The launching range of this soaker would make Evil Knievel die of laughter. Added to that, I've been reading other reviews about some of these ""Flash Floods"" breaking down or leaking after a few days of use and it is true. Mine began to leak and the trigger broke afterwards. All in all, this is a great gun in originality, but compared to other models, it's obsolete. Buy at your own risk!"
4,"It is a great soaker, same as last years though","I have the normal flash flood, and it is great! This is the exact same water gun, though. The only difference is the coloring. I am not sure if it works with the new back pack though. The normal nozzle is great, but the flash flood nozzle is very good. It holds a very impressive 40 oz. of water. If you have enough money, I would buy it! Also, you should look at the Aquapack Devastator."
4,Handy for the random in-dorm water fight or as a highlighter gun,"I got this gun for ""self defense"" after an indoor water fight broke out at my summer program. It's compact, fillable from a sink tap, and accurate enough to get more water on your target then on the walls. Using the alt-fire is a good way to piss someone off, or get people who don't want to get wet to back down. It's unobtrusive and can easily be stashed.For fun at black lit dances, take the core out of a highlighter and tape it to the intake nozzle in the main tank. The resulting fluid fluoresces under the black light, producing a bright stream that makes whatever you hit glow. I drew some smilies on the walls and ceiling."
2,Good Gun bad durablity,"This is the best Gun I had in a long time, But I had it for 4 days and took it outside 3 times and on the third time I had a water war w/5 friends and the stupid trigger broke.That really mad me mad because I had this great gun that shot far and straight with a very cool flash flood system and then the main trigger breaks. And theres more reports about the trigger breaking not just me. so if you just want 4 days of fun buy this gun,but otherwise DON'T BUY THIS GUN IT SUCKS"
2,sigh dissapointment,now i like super soaker but this doesnt seem to have a cps you still have to pump it just as much as any other soaker also the range isnt quite as far as id like like 25 stright angle bout 32 my brothers artic shock can shoot a little over 40 ft and the stream last for quite a while the max infusion are an improvement over last year in range water ect but not much made by hasbro will ever stand up to anything made by larami exept maebe the artic shock in some instances
4,Nice water gun,"We have had this gun for about a month with no problems. Squirts a lot of water, perfect for hot days!"
4,very good soaker,"This is a very good super soaker. I have the regular version of the flash flood, and it is very powerful. The regular stream is powerful and shoots very far. The flash flood can also soak an apponent quickly. The one thing I hate about it is the durability. Mine broke after a couple of weeks; the regular stream wouldn't fire. So be careful with it. It's awesome!!"
3,Water gun,"The blaster is short lived and the overall construction of the product could be a little better. However, this was my firt super soaker and I am very impressed."
4,Lots of fun,"Honest opinion here. the quality of super soakers has gone down. I have some that are 10 years old, sat for 5 years and still work. I don't think this one will last that long. I do like the fill cap. you just turn on the water and press it onto the faucet. it has a spring loaded valve so when you push it on the faucet it opens and allows the water to flow in, when you remove it from the faucet, it springs back and wont let the water out. very nice. its easy to pump, reasonable pressure, and as you might imagin, wet."
3,A Decent Super Soaker :),Best Super Soaker I have been able to find... But that doesn't say much... Since I have not been able to find a decent Water Gun since I was a kid
5,Fun,"This is a fun water gun. A huge amount of water comes out of the top after you pump as an enormously powerful blast of water (you get about 2 blasts before having to pump again). The bottom portion of of the gun sends a steady stream quite a distance away. Overall, it's fun. We got it at the end of the season, so we'll see how durable it is. This really is a lot of fun (it's definitely not intended for small children)."
2,Did Not Last Long...,"This water gun is very fun to play with. You will have some trouble pumping it, and an attachable bag with extra water is very helpful. However, while using it lately, I filled it up, pulled the Flash Flood trigger, and water just spurted out, even though I had pumped the water gun at least 10-20 times. The nozzle appeared jammed. All attempts to unclog the nozzle were unsuccessful (short of tearing the gun apart), and I have not used it since. If you have a very well-filtered water source, buy it, if not, don't."
