2,Noisy and Works Sporadically,"I had my cooling stand about a week when it began making noise. After 2 weeks, it began working off and on and did very little in the way of cooling my laptop. I have had it about 6 months now and it still works off and on and I still use it to keep my laptop raised from setting directly in my lap. That is really all it is good for."
2,"Does not lay flat, not for big laptops!","I bought this at a store and nowhere on the package does it mention that it is only for laptops 15.4"" and under like it says in the description above. So of course I came home and set my 17"" laptop on it only to watch it wobble awkwardly on my desk. Then I realized you HAVE to use the tilting feature of the stand to use it. There's no way for the thing to lay flat otherwise. Though it looks nice, it is too lightweight and cheaply built. Sure, other reviewers may score it high on its cooling methods, but several have also scored it low on its poorly thought-out design. Shouldn't something as simple as a laptop stand have nearly unanimous positive reviews for you to be convinced you should purchase it? Skip this one."
2,Shop Around Before You Buy This One,"The fan works fine and the size is o.k. However the two rubberized grips (pads) that are supposed to hold the laptop in place don't work very well. My laptop tends to slide down off the pad. Then there is a stand that folds out on the bottom to keep the laptop at a good working angle. However the stand is not designed to lock in place. So if you try to slide the cooling pad (with laptop on it) back on your table or desk, the stand collapses down to your work surface. Not good. I judge this to be a poor design. At least if the grips (pads) held the laptop in place, I would try to permanently affix the stand so that it does not fold down. But I think I will just return this one."
1,Worked for a week,It's not as good as it looks in the picture.One I got broke in a week or two.It's stand it very cheap quality plastic and so it the product.
2,CHEAP!,I have bought 2 of these coolers. WHen they work they really do work. They will keep a laptop cool. I use this for a gaming laptop with a dedicated Video/graphics card. These get really hot when playing a demanding game. Heat will harm any computer. I bought this cooler and it worked for a while and then stopeed. SO I bought another as they are not too expensive. This on still works after a couple years but the fan now rubs and it is very noisy. When I buy another Im going with a different brand.
2,Rattle. Rattle. Rattle.,"This cooling pad did a good job at first. It is cheap, low-powered, and requires only a usb plugin. After a while, the fan would start rattling and the noise is just annoying.I've tried cleaning it, lubricating it, and stretching apart the fan guards but it just keeps rattling."
1,did not last 3 months,This is a junk. The fan started to make a terrible noise. Do not buy this !!! The rubber on the front also wore out after only 3 months.
1,Complete waste of money,"I bought this because it claimed to have the highest air flow current. I have a pretty big HP dv6 quad-edition laptop that gets very hot very quickly, and I was hoping this would solve the problem. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I bought this cooling pad around the end of August, and it started to stop working at times about a week ago. I usually could just unplug and replug it back into my laptop and it would start working again, but today it has just completely stopped working.The pad is entirely made of a sturdier plastic, with a slightly elevated bump on the bottom and a slightly concave top. It blows air onto the laptop instead of sucking heat off, but because the fan is placed right in the middle of the (very small) pad, it isn't effective at more than one small spot.The one good thing is that it isn't very loud. Not completely quiet, but not loud."
1,poorly made,"I only had the cooling pad 2 days and one of the blades broke off. Now, two weeks later, it is short four blades. I would say to be cautious of this product. It is inexpensive for a reason."
3,"Useful, but short-lived!","I've had this product for less than a month, and it already broke! I can't even figure out HOW it broke - the fan just stopped spinning! It was also not terrible comfortable for use on my lap, which sort of defeats the purpose of a LAPTOP cooling unit. I am really disappointed with this product!"
2,Not very sturdy,"I bought one about 3 months ago, and several of the blades inside the fan housing have broken off reducing the amount of airflow. Still works, but the parts aren't very sturdy.Why I would need one in the first place,as in why the manufacturer didn't design a better way to keep it cool seems odd to me.I has kept me out of the unwelcome shut downs due to heat build up... so yeah, it works."
1,"Bought 2 within a month, both broke. *very cheaply made*","I purchased this exact laptop cooling pad at Best Buy. It worked great...for 3 weeks. As soon as I moved my laptop slightly, the legs that the cooling pad were standing on collapsed, and jammed up the fan, and even broke off half the fan blades. I returned it to Best Buy, they gave me a brand new one, no problem. Came home, 2 weeks later, exact same thing happened. Jammed up the fan again, and one fan blade broke off. Will not be buying this cooling fan again!!!"
1,Very fragile!,"Product worked alright. However, if the computer is at a weird angle (anything other than flat, when the computer is on your laptop, for example) the fan stops and makes a weird grinding noise. I put up with it for a month, until the fan simply stopped working. Do not buy this product."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!,"Absolute RUBBISH!!!!!! I purchased this product on a Saturday--by Sunday, one of the fan blades had fallen off. The fan continued to work, but by Monday, two more blades had fallen off. By Wednesday, the thing stopped working altogether. GARBAGE!!!!"
1,Wrong in too many ways,"Wish I had bought something else. This fan started making a lot of noise about the 2nd month, and has gone downhill ever since. The fan is loose in it's housing, so vibrates very loudly for a few minutes when first start it up, but then it gets quiet. Cools pretty well when going, but loud then too. Pathetically weak stand broke off yesterday, and never was trustworthy. Bump the laptop just a bit & it falls. The ""grip"" on top only holds my laptop so-so...it slides down sometimes. They just need to tweak the design: make the stand thicker plastic, have it lock into usable place, tighten up the fan housing (made in China no doubt), and make the grip a little gripier. It is lightweight, which is good, but too bulky to travel with imo. It's just been a pain in the rear almost every day since I've bought it."
1,"Great cooling pad, but highly unreliable.","I purchased this cooling pad a few ago when my laptop began overheating.I loved it immediately. Not only did it save my laptop, but it was cost efficient, looked sleek, raised the back of the laptop about 2"", and the single fan cooled well and quietly; those without could almost envy my owning it.Yes, I loved it for approximately three months... then it broke. About four days ago I noticed it wasn't working. The fan smelt like a burnt match. The store I purchased it from kindly replaced it. However, it broke again two days later, again smelling of a burnt match. I imagine I could exchange the replacement for an identical pad, but why chance a third cooling pad breaking?I do not typically write product reviews, but am taking the time to persuade you to not purchase this cooling pad. Please, if only out of respect of my two lost cooling pads: don't risk it and take your money elsewhere."
4,Great little device,"I just got this item today and I wonder how I ever did without it. I use my laptop for 8-10 hrs each day and by mid-day, it would usually turn into a nice little space heater. I'd leave to get a cup of coffee, and my cat would be asleep on top of it! But now, even after a full day of use, it feels as cool as when I first turned it on. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the somewhat flimsy construction. It leaves me to wonder how it would hold up under constant travel, opening and closing the compartment door, etc. I don't travel with it, so I'm not too worried about that part."
3,Quality does not match the price.,"Whereas I am satisfied with the shipping, I am not satisfied with the product. This is a very lightweight plastic that seems easily breakable. If tipped on its side, the fan doesn't run correctly. The prop stand on the bottom does not lock in the open position and if it isn't used, the fan will not get enough air. I think $26 should bring a better quality laptop cooler. It does cool, its just cheap."
2,Cooling Fan,My laptop was constantly overheating and continued to shut down. i thought I would try this cooling fan and solve the problem. It did not help. I returned it for a refund.
3,"Serves the purpose, but...","This laptop cooling stand worked great upon arrival and immediately upon use. But... we disconnected it (for the first time) to take our laptop somewhere and when we got back home, upon reconnection, the port/jack where the cord plugs in got pushed inside of the housing. Had to disassemble the stand, re-position port/jack, and re-assemble unit. Once inside the unit, the jack is only ""hot-glued"" in position. Not very stable. In addition, while the angle in which you can tilt the laptop is appealing, the back leg (that tilts the laptop) does not lock into position providing a little instability. However, minimal noise from fan and laptop is no longer hot to the touch!! Is there a mediocre review instead of ""good"" or ""bad"" review?!?! I guess it is one of those instances where ""You get what you pay for."" If this is the only thing that is within your budget, be prepared to either; not disconnect it, or perform maintenance on it."
1,Do not buy this product!,"OK, my toshiba gets HOT so I got this laptop cooling pad. Was great until the AC plug broke. I had only had it maybe 45 days max! And I'm careful with my things.Not buying another one!"
2,Not Reccomended,The cooling pad is very loud.The supporting lever is not doing the job. The little hole for the cord retracted and disappeared.I do not recommend this product at all.
2,Laptop Avalanche,"I've used a lot of laptop coolers, but this one I have to give mixed reviews.PROS: It has the most airflow of any cooler I've used before and it looks nice.CONS: This is NOT a universal laptop cooler. You really need to make certain your laptop fits this cooling pad before you buy it.My Asus K50AB is too wide for it, there is no ""catch-lip"" on the cooler, and the ""gripper"" pads on the cooler are slick causing my laptop to CONSTANTLY slide off the cooler. It's pretty hard to type anything when your chasing the keyboard.The fan is louder than any cooler I've used before but not objectionably so. For the airflow, this is a good compromise.The curved design mandates that you use the kick stand on the back or the cooler sits flat on it's fan, causing almost no airflow at all.The slightest bump will cause the kick-stand to fold up.I wouldn't buy this product again."
1,Stopped abruptly in less than 3 weeks.,"I purchased this based on a recommendation after a Targus fan failed in less than a month. This Belkin fan is stylish and very quiet. But after less than 3 weeks it suddenly made a loud noise, as if the blade hit something, and died. I tried shaking the tray to hear if there was a loose part that may have hit the blade, but found nothing. After trying Targus and Belkin I guess I'll move up the price ladder till I find one that lasts a few months...."
1,Noisy and doesn't last long,"I bought this at walmart about a week ago, and the silly thing's already making noise to beat the band! At first, I thought it was just being stubborn so i turned unplugged it and just left it. Didn't help. This product is cheaply made. I will not be wasting anymore money on this"
1,Belkin F5L001-BLK,I bought two of these. The first one lasted a month. the second never worked. look at other options. Do not waste your money.
1,Terrible Belkin Cool Pad,It worked great for maybe 2-3 weeks then it made a loud grinding noise. I opened it up and it is really cheaply made. I am going to buy a different cooling pad.
1,Nice while it works... but it doesn't work for long,"I have a 17"" ""desktop replacement"" laptop, which gets quite hot on my lap... actually the top gets hot too. I decided I needed a laptop cooling device, so I went to the local wally world and looked at their choices. I have had good luck with Belkin products in the past, so I bought this product. Boy am I disappointed... it worked well for about 2-3 months, then the fan started getting **Really** loud. After about another month it just stopped altogether. I no longer have the receipt and I never registered the product with Belkin, so I am out of luck. This is a horrible product! Save yourself the trouble and buy a better product, I was browsing Amazon looking for a new cooler to replace this one when I saw the link for this product, so I had to give a review of this product."
1,wow - what a piece of crap,"To be fair, it worked great while it worked at all. Unfortunately, I received it Feb. 14. Today is Feb 22 and it no longer works. Unreal."
1,Worthless piece of junk,"I got this for my son for Christmas because he had wanted it. He tried it out the same day and within minutes two blades of the fan broke of. And with continued use more broke off. It did cool but not continuously and ran very quietly as opposed to the ones some other reviewers got. It was in fact so quiet that my son kept checking if it was indeed running and cooling. After about a couple of weeks most of the fan blades had broken off and the stand collapsed for good. For the $12 purchae price we thought it was too much trouble to return it and my son bought himself a different cooling pad, the Cooler Master Notepal U2 Notebook Cooler with Two Fans R9-NBC-8PBK-GP, which is so far working fine."
1,Nope,"I've had this for about two months.Pros:-Inexpensive-Easy to connectCons:-Fan rests against your legs (even using the stand), blocking the vent and negating the purpose of the tray.-The fan keeps getting stuck on the case, causing it to stop.-Two fan blades have broken off due to getting caught on the case.-The kick stand doesn't lock into place and collapses easily.-The non-slip strips are too slick, and my computer repeatedly slides around.Bottom line, it's too cheaply made and a poor design. I recommend looking elsewhere."
1,I think I'll look into Targus.,"I purchased this product from Best Buy. A week later, a piece of the fan broke. Mind you, I was using it on a flat desk and it never moved. I returned it, and they convinced me to exchange it for the same one. About a month and a half later, after I had lost the receipt, the same thing happened again. I tried taking it apart and supergluing it, but still, it would not work. On another note, it was the noisiest chill mat I ever had. Sure, it cooled the laptop down a bit, but not as well as the Targus model a friend of mine has.Do not buy this product. The one fan does not evenly distribute cool air unless your CPU and battery are in the middle of the laptop. Get a 2 fan model, and don't buy Belkin. I have had so many problems with their products, and I am the type of person who takes good care of his electronics."
2,Cools but horrible quality,I bought mine and it only lasted 2 months before the fan simply died. I sent it back and recieved another only to have the port for the power pull out with the plug somehow. Again I sent it back and tried one last time to have it work 2 weeks and then the fan die out. Save yourself the trouble and buy something worth quality.
1,Piece of Junk,Plain and Simple: Don't waste your money. Seriously. This cooling fan lasted about 4 months and died. My Toshiba Satellite laptop (another product to avoid) gets way over-heated very quickly so I need some thing that works.
2,its small.. but..,"I don't like it. I've had this for all of...4 months, and already three of the plastic fan-pieces have broken off. I'm a little klutzy when it comes with electronics, but this wasn't my fault. the pieces had broken, so I had to break them off to get it to work again.Every now and then, I will have to use a small pencil or pen to get it working again. also on occasion I'll have to stretch the cord out and plug it into one of my further-away USB ports in order for it to work properly. My laptop, before I bought it, was overheating horribly, and this seemed very userfriendly and cheap. I'm using it now, and my laptop is still averaging 80 degrees Celsius. I'm hoping to get a new one in February.All in all, I don't recommend this for anyone. Go get the slightly more expensive one; it'll be worth it in the long run."
1,1 awful product.,"This product is absolutely awful. You get so little for so much (up to $35 USD at the time of purchase). There is one puny little fan (60-80mm) that's supposed to keep your computer cool! The little stand is flimsy (it can't be used with the stand folded up because of the ""superior wave-form"" design) as is the entire body of the cooler. After about a week, the fan either didn't reach it's full possible speed, wouldn't start, or made some fairly load noise. After 2 weeks, the flimsy stand broke off. Then, after just 3 weeks, the cooler did something really special: The fan would start up, reach the speed it ""felt"" like going, then a grinding/grating noise emanated from the cooling pad as the fan stuttered and jerked about, producing no airflow at all (it was minimal to begin with, though). You know how they say ""You get what you pay for""? Well, in this case, you pay for a decent electronic, and you get a piece of cheap junk."
1,Save your money,"If I'd written this review in the first month I owned the pad, I would have given it 5 stars. But, I should have believed the other reviews that said it quickly stops working. Within a month, the motor started making noises. I learned to start it upside down - that worked - and slowly turn it over. Then, I had to shake it to stop the noise. Then tap it. After almost 9 months of babying this thing, I give up. It has been more trouble than it is worth. It still works once I get through the warm-up exercise with it, but the routine is getting longer and more difficult every day!"
1,Belkin Laptop Cooling pad,"The design looks like cheap plastic, but does it matter?This cooling pad seems to get the job done as far as cooling is concerned. However, after 3 months using it, I cannot use it any longer. It is now making enough noise that it is bothering me and the coworkers co-located with me.I am going to buy another cooler using another technology."
1,very bad product,it is a very bad product. I just bought it three months ago and now it is broken :(
2,Doesn't last long...,"It only lasted about 7 months for me, then it broke. Never try, never know. I would suggest anyone who is thinking about getting this pad to look for a better one. Perhaps invest into one that may be a little more high end, and just a little more expensive, but will last."
1,Not recommended,"I purchased this Belkin-laptop cooler a few days ago; I used it for approx. 6 hours. When I turned on my laptop today, I didn't think the cooler was on. It was securely plugged into my laptop and in the cooler its self. I lifted up my laptop and saw that the fan was not running. I grabbed it and touched the fan with my nail where it started running. Only now, it was very, very, very noisy. I unplugged the connection from the cooler and plugged it back in, it didn't start up automatically like it should've. I once again had to touch the blade with my nail to get it to start going where it still made a very loud noise."
1,Cheap quality plastic and noisy fan!,"First of all there were not so many pictures on the website to give you a clear picture of what this product will be like. Last but not the least the product came defective and as soon as I plugged in into the USB port of my laptop, the laptop cooling fan started with lot of noise. I returned this product. Very cheap quality plastic and very procey..certainly not worth the money !! Thank you."
1,Cheap plastic + Curve = lots of noise,I just bought this item today and the fan seems pretty powerful but it is making a loud whiring noise. It looks like a design flaw because of the curved shape
1,Noisy and poorly designed,I bought this to replace an Antec cooler I've had for a couple of years. I quickly discovered that this single fan cooler is actually much noisier than my older 2-fan Antec.It also has an odd concave shape that makes your laptop wiggle if it is not sized just right. Or you'll have to push your laptop up to center it and have the cooler base stick out of the bottom. Which makes it uncomfortable if you're used to placing your hands on the palmrest.
2,Belkin cooling stand,I'm a little bit irritating with this product because after 2 weeks this cooling stand started making a noise when I tun on my laptop. I must always remember to connect the cooler to the laptop after approximately five minutes. Besides that noise it works well.
5,Belkin F5L001 Laptop Cooling stand,"I am very pleased with the Belkin Laptop cooling stand..I bought one for myself and one for my grandson in college.Both work fine and we are both pleased with the product.I was told that the cooling stands could be noisy, butthe Belkin is very quiet and efficient."
2,GREAT CONCEPT POOR QUALITY,"Belkin clearly provided the specs for this unit to an Asian manufacturer which produced the cheapest quality product possible...I would venture to say that this item is worth no more than maybe $10 with the packaging reflecting at least $1.50 of that cost. Make no mistake, it is probably the best available currently but it will soon be replaced by better quality from another manufacturer. I purchased two thus far and had to return one because of a very noisy fan...Better you should wait for a superior product if you can."
2,Been using two a few weeks now and one is very noisy,"This notebook cooler seems a little on the flimsy/cheap end. I've been using two of them for a few weeks. One of them has already started being very noisy. Not pleasant! The other one is in a more noisy environment but it is quieter (but definitely no where near silent - it's still noisier than I'd like). I am concerned about how long these units will last. I also think there should be at least two fan speed settings, like low and high."
5,Best price and value,I think it is worth spending 15-20 bucks on Laptop cooler. Not only it is good for the laptop; it also makes it makes it easiler and confortable for me to use the laptop (with cooler) on my laps.
3,Not very re-positionable,"Product works as advertised; My iBook G4 would get smoking hot, but after putting it on top of the Belkin cooling stand and plugging in the fan, it got significantly cooler. It also cooled down my new Macbook Pro satisfactorily. The fan is LOUD though; It makes my old Dell 8400 tower sound silent.My major gripe with this unit is the fact that the stand that holds the stand up at that viewing angle is very flimsy. If you try repositioning the laptop and cooler (ie push it back) the stand collapses on itself and your laptop goes crashing down too. Not a very good design in my opinion; They would have been better off putting on some position locks or something on this thing."
3,laptop cooling stand,The Belkin cooling was a great price and it works great. I checked other sources and found them to be $10. to #15. higher. My laptop stays cool on my lap and easily plugs into the USB port. This stand is great to work on a table or while sitting in a chair or in bed. Iam very pleased with my purchase and you will be as well.
4,That'll do nicely,"Does a decent job , my Toshiba laptop didnt overheat anyway even though i use it non stop 12 hour day.This belkin fan should cure any heating problems i was unaware of , fairly quiet fan.Im pretty pleased in fact i bought 2 more as Christmas gifts.The only down side ive experienced is getting the [...] on line rebate.Per usual you get messed around , so ill print it out and await my [...]."
1,Good while it lasts,"I bought it thinking it wouldn't break on me like everyone else's did. 1 month after getting it, it broke. The fan just stopped working for no reason.Pretty crappy considering my new cooling station was cheaper and has lasted WAAAAAY longer than this one."
4,Works Great,"It works great . I live in the caribean, the room is warm where I live during the day. So I bought this product. It has being working great for the past month. It manages to keep my laptop alot cooler than I am in the room. Great buy, great product.I am glad it comes with a standing portion for all those ebooks I read at night it makes it comfortable to look at the screen."
1,rubbish!,"Initially i was pleased with this item even considering how loud the darn thing it. However, I've had it less than a month and it no longer works...I realize this was a lower cost item but even at 20 dollars i expect something last longer than 30 days!!"
2,not that great,"it did a decent job of cooling my laptop when it WAS working. It was noisy -- would make a really annoying RRRR noise every once in a while and I would have to hit it to make it stop. Didn't like that it took up USB space. And, it randomly stopped working after about a year. I am not going to get another."
3,Works but too noisy.,"Belkin says they were rated high in the cooling category and only use one fan. Using one fan means they have to run it at high RPM's. One fan cools the laptop but high RPM's mean excessive noise. Also, it runs from a USB port so you lose the use of that port. The cooling unit should have an auxilliary USB port."
5,Cool My Dell,My Dell laptop was a real hot performer both litterally and temp wise. I've tried three other cooling mats and none have been able to keep it cool and running at optimal levels. This one however not only is extremely quiet but does the job and then some. Great product.
2,ehh,Ive had this fan for only a month and the fan stopped dead today. I dont like the noise the fan makes either. Its cheap yes but is it worth it? not really.
1,Belkin Laptop Cooling Pad is COMPLETE JUNK,"Owned it for roughly two months and it suddenly began making this loud noise (impossible to ignore while using it and worried me that the fan was probably going to seize-up soon). Tried to contact Belkin and they ignored my email (imagine that). DO NOT BUY BELKIN LAPTOP COOLING PADS ... THEY ARE JUNK ... in fact, considering the fact they blew me off when I tried to contact them, it would probably be wise to avoid their products altogether."
2,DOESN'T LIVE UP TO BELKIN BRAND,"This is not a product made to be used for any length of time. This pad is made to sit on a hard surface, it will work on your lap but it is very uncomfortable. I've had my product for about a year and it worked ok for the occasional use with my old macbook. it didn't heat up the way my macbook pro does With my new mbp, the computer stays hot after an hour of use. The pad did an awesome job of keeping the laptop cool until it quit working! I paid too much for this junky laptop pad for it to quit working this quickly.Pro's:non-slip gripscurved design to allow air flowprice (on amazon)short usb cord, perfect for my macbook or mbpsmall size works great for 13"" laptopfits inside computer bagCon's:uncomfortablefan will make crazy noise if pad is jarred or sat on a soft surfacenot made for lapnot built to lastAs a fan of belkin products, I can say, this pad doesn't deserve the brand belkin at all!!"
3,Good product,Works as described. We use this to keep our laptop off the bed and cool while watching hulu and netflix in bed. Does a great job for that. Only use the USB fan occasionally.
2,"Nice design, effective cooling but NOISY","This is a nice-looking pad that cools very well. Unfortunately the fan is EXTREMELY NOISY. I can usually last half an hour before I have to unplug the pad for my head to take a rest from the noise. I am using my laptop on a desk with external monitor & keyboard so it is not that I am blocking the fan or pushing on it with my thighs/arms etc. It is simply very poor quality. So the result is a nice-looking effective pad that I can hardly use! If you spend hours on your computer (like I do) you may want to consider another pad.Update Mar 15 2009: The noise on the Belkin became so unbearable that I tossed it (so it only lasted 4-5 months). I have now bought a ZALMAN ZM-NC1000 Ultra Quiet Notebook Cooler. It costs $50 but it is worth every single penny and then some. High quality sturdy construction, superior cooling and completely quiet. I highly recommend it. http://www.amazon.com/ZALMAN-Ultra-Notebook-Cooler-ZM-NC1000/dp/B000JSFT0Y"
1,WORKED FOR LESS THAN 3 MONTHS!,"I bought this Belkin fan on November 25, 2008, received it about a week later, and started using it immediately. It did a good job of cooling at first. By the end of January 2009 (after only 2 months) it started frequently starting and stopping. I believe it is the poor design of its attached USB cord. Always being on the go, it is very frustrating to have to move the cord just right to get the fan blowing. Unfortunately, I am not the only one having this problem. I also didn't like the design of the opening on the bottom for air flow. Seriously? This is for a a ""LAPTOP"" not a ""DESKTOP"" computer. People take these on the go and need to have them on their lap. Unless you always keep your laptop on a desk, the elevation lift flap on the bottom is useless.*****BOTTOM LINE~~Shop around and AVOID this model*****"
2,Another cheap chillpad.,"The good: It did what it was supposed to very well... for the time that it did it.I got this to replace a targus dual fan laptop pad... this, like the targus pad, feels very cheep.The fan worked very well and kept the laptop cool. Much more powerful than my pervious targus (which I'm waiting for a replacement).The bad: while it worked well, it did so for about a week. Now its dead. I'm thinking this will be the norm for most laptop coolers as all I've seen thusfar seem like they cost the manufacturer 0.05 cents to make.The good: Lifetime warranty, so it will be replaced, at my shipping expence >:( .I might give up and try a fanless cooler."
2,pretty poor design,"The pop-out stand to tilt the laptop isn't very good. It doesn't lock, so when I lift it, the stand half closes, so I have to hold it open whenever I place it down.When I place the cooler on my lap, the 2 ridges on the bottom aren't very comfortable to me.After 3 months of use, the fan sounds like it's dying. I wouldn't be surprised if this is because the fan scraped up some stuff off of cloth surfaces(like pants, bed covers, or anything I put the cooler on top of) because there's not much clearance on the bottom beneath the fan.Now, it's only being used on my desk as a stand to tilt my laptop(not using the fan because of the noise). At least the Belkin cooler provides space under my laptop for some natural cooling."
2,Works but made cheap,"I bought this cooler a month ago. It works. It keeps my laptop 20 degrees cooler. However, at times the fan just stops working. One of the little black pieces of the fan broke off, and the door just snapped off when I closed it. It is very cheaply made."
2,works when it works,"I have owned my belkin laptop cooling stand for over a year now. It does a good job of cooling the computer but I have had many problems with it. First the power connection port became loose and was pushed inside the unit where it could not be accessed. I took apart the stand (remove 9-10 screws) and glued it in place and have had no other problems with that.The biggest problem is the cheap, noisy, fan in the unit. The standard 80mm fan 5v fan frequently (like 9 times a day) requires attention. At this point I am taking the unit apart every couple days to clean and service the fan so that it (1) works and (2) will run more quietly. Usually I can blow dirt or dust off the fan or jar it and it will function properly again for a short while.I have looked into replacing the fan but the shipping for a replacement fan costs 2-3 times as much as the fan and I refuse to pay that sort of shipping. I am currently looking for a cooling pad that has better quality parts."
3,Better wear some finger guards!,"I have given my fingers a nice ""chopping"" in the fan a couple of times while trying to get the stand to flip up. Not that I didn't have it up to begin with, but at many random times while using my laptop the stand collapses. So I reach and CHOP, CHOP, CHOP!!!There's got to be something better."
4,"For the price, a very effective solution!","I've had the Belkin laptop stand for about two weeks now, and I've been pleasantly surprised at how effective it has been at channeling the heat away from my laptop. When I opened the box and examined the stand, I thought it looked too flimsy to do any good. Now, I find that I use it all the time. True, the flip-out part does little good and I don't use that, but even when I forget to plug in the fan, this stand still keeps my laptop cooler than before.My laptop's temperature sensor also tells me that the stand is effective. Prior to getting the stand, the sensor ranged from 44 to 51 degrees (Celsius), depending on what I was doing. With the stand, and with the fan running, the temperature usually stays in the high 30s.I wish Belkin had recessed the plug and provided a channel for the wire, because I occasionally get it tangled with the laptop power cord. But for the price, it's a good investment."
1,Didn't last,"I've had this notebook cooler for about 4 months now.Month 1- it cooled well.Month 2- became noisy, but continued to cool well.Month 3- noisy, sputtering, sometimes it would stop.Month 4- completely dead.Seeing as I paid close to list price for this product, I did not get my money's worth. At least it looked nice while it lasted."
1,BAD DESIGN,"This product has got to be the absolute most poorly designed product I've ever seen from this company. The product is intended for use with a laptop, but if you're actually using the laptop ON your lap, your legs or clothing block the fans ability to intake air and it is no longer effective at cooling. The little ""leg"" on the bottom is useless, it doesn't stay in place. The ""non-slip"" strips, yeah...they slip...all the time. Worthless. This product should be pulled off the shelves and redesigned completely."
1,Not so good Al,I got this item as a christmas gift. It is now less than 2 months old (Feb 14)and makes so much noise I can't use it. Motor sounds like a 727 coming in for a landing. Piece of junk. Sorry.
2,Dumbest design ever.,"This cooling tray is not something you want to use when you're on the go, or if you ever plan to move it.One, the vent is on the BOTTOM dead center, which if its on your lap you've got a fan whirring at your knees, or it's blocked (though the concave design does allow air to flow through the top vent if it's not obstructed.)Now, the real dumb design flaw here is a combination effect....the little ""foot"" that puts it on an angle collapses rather easily, which is a pain in the butt. What makes it WORSE is the vent-fan's opening has NO PROTECTIVE GRATE around it. meaning you go to pick it up with it plugged in and your finger WILL go through. I just took a lovely little chunk out of my finger.This is quite possibly one of the dumbest designs for one of these things. Invest in something else, it's worth it.And to make it even worse, the tray doesn't cool my main vent that well anyhow."
3,Yea!! I got it back to working,"I really need this laptop cooler, because the battery gets very hot (it's a Dell what can I say?). It's been 3 months and the Belkin cooler works fine, but my laptop does overlap it, and the pull down flap, well, you have to work with the flap. Today the fan did not work and I noticed the blades would move a little and then just stop. I unscrewed the back and checked the wires and didn't noticed any disconnected wires. After I plugged the cooler back into the laptop, I watched the fan to see if a blade was getting caught. Because the casing is so close to the actual fan there was a blade getting caught; the cooler is now working, minus one blade, but I can live with that (I am prepared to sacrifice more blades, if necessary). For the price it's not so bad, but Belkin does needs to work on the casing protecting the fan and a stronger pull out flap to stand the fan on."
1,"Belkin short-lived solution, quality low","I have an HP Pavilion Entertainment PC that I use for a lot of stock-trading graphics so it tends to run warm. I purchased the Belkin cool pad after some research on the web. It cooled the laptop very well, although the fan on the cool pad was a bit loud from the start. After a relatively short use, maybe 3 months, the fan became progressively louder and I often had to unplug and resart the Belkin to get the fan to run quietly. It just totally died after frequently sounding like it was grinding coffee instead of cooling my laptop. I looked on Amazon and replaced it with a Logitech cool pad and just received it. The fan is incredibly quiet and, so far, the laptop is running cool again. We'll see if this one is better than the Belkin and lasts longer.I would not buy the Belkin again due to its short life and noisy fan."
2,works great at first...,"Worked great at first, cooled well and quiet, but that lasted about 5 weeks. Now everyone knows when I plug it in, the noise is awful sounds like an engine revving up. I have taken canned air and sprayed it, doesn't make a difference and yes I use it with the stand, which is another issue. Using the stand is not very stable. It is slippery and my computer shifts on it. I have also had the stand collapse on it twice. Would not recommend this product."
2,Initially quiet and good cooler but didn't last,"I bought it at the end of November after my Targus dual fan, USB hub unit gave up at about 10 months. This simple single fan unit worked well for just under 2 months before the fan started making noise. I babied it for a couple of days but now the bearings are going out in the fan and it is just barely turning. Not worth the money."
1,Broke After 3 Months and HORRIBLE Exchange Policy,"I have used this product for 3 months and it's already broken. To make matters worse, Belkin does not have an agreement with Best Buy, where I bought it, so instead of getting an instant replacement (as it is still under warranty), I now have to PAY to ship them the broken product and wait until it arrives at their factory before they will ship me a new one. In the meantime, I can't use my laptop as much as I used to, because it will quickly heat. I have no other recourse, as Belkin will not offer refunds. Please do not buy this product."
2,Not the best option for the money,"I've owned this product for about a year. After about two month's use, it started making lots of vibration noise. I opened up the case and adjusted the fan; this worked for a while, but the noise came back. After several adjustments, one of the four the plastic connections for the fan fatigued and broke off. It is still useable, but it still occasionally makes noise. Had bought a second cooling pad about the same time and found it reliable, worry-free, and silent (LapCool 4)."
3,Mixed Feelings,"A bit noisy then I would have expected. Also, it does not fit my laptop too well. Check well with the dimentions before getting it."
2,Not wide enough,"This product has a pretty good quality. The fan noise is acceptable compare to the competitors.The only problem is that this cooler is just not wide enough. As a result, The laptop cannot stand on its rubber which usually made to keep the distance between laptop and surface so the ventilation will not get clog.The hottest part of my laptop (Lenovo Ideapad Y510 15.4 inch) is on the left side of the touch pad; there's an ventilation on the bottom of the hottest part. Anyhow, because the cooler is not wide enough, It cause the ventilation blocked by the cooler rubber pad.Advertisement says that It's designed for 15.4 inch laptop, but it is not. It is for the smaller laptop.See the picture I posted for detail."
2,Good looking design but big flaws,Smart curved design with anti slip pads is great.Then- Fan is quite noisy- Could use a Hi-low switch- USB plug increase wear on computer power supply (couldn't find the wattage for that fan...)- The back Support(riser) that flips open is very flimsy! and uncomfortable when in my lap.- Added openings in the curved bottom of the cooler would have alleviated constant use of the fan and save its apparently unreliable motor (see other people's review) by improving static cooling.
5,Best of it's kind!,"I love this product! Other laptop cooling stands can be bulky, uncomfortable in your lap, not easily situated, etc. but this one is great. It's super quiet, the design is awesome, it's so comfortable in your lap or on a desk and it does it's job really well. I give it 5 stars!"
2,Nice concept poor design.,"Great concept for keeping laptops cool, but poorly designed.1)Great because it plugs into a usb port2)Fairly slim3)Looks GreatPoor1) The tilt stand do not lock into place.2) Fan sits at bottom of bend so everytime it touches something the fan stops.3) Must be used on a FLAT surface, not your lap like most people would use it for.4) Fan started to die after 2 weeks of use5) Rubber holding pads for laptop not built for ultra portable laptops orlaptops larger than 15"". Most laptop bottom are not made for the design of this cooler. Maybe a 14"" would be fine.Over all Belkin needs to redesign. Possibly go out and look at different laptops and figure out, what really will work instead of tring to make it look pretty!"
4,no problems!,"$20 bucks and not any louder than my laptop's fan. The fan on the computer turns on less and my legs aren't getting cooked. I do like the way the fan blows up into the bottom of the computer, I think it encourages airtflow through the computer (my computer has small openings on the bottom and the fan vents out one of the back corners). The little prop stand and wire storage door are fairly cheap and flimsy, but I think that they will work just fine. I have already been bit by the fan once when trying to stand up the little back leg, but no harm done. I have never used another laptop stand so I don't have much basis for comparison, but I am perfectly happy with this one and would recommend it."
2,Not impressed,"First I will say that yes, this item does keep my laptop cool. But I've had it for 6 months now and I just don't think it's that great of a product. Here are my gripes:* It is cheaply made. I have little confidence that it is going to last very long.* It is generally noisy, and every once in a while it makes a terrible groaning sound (probably the belt or something).* It is unsafe to adjust the legs while the fan is on. There have been several occasions where my fingers found their way into the fan.* The USB cord doesn't have a pass-through connector, so it uses up a port.That said, I think there are better products out there. My roommate uses the fan by Antec and it seems to be a better deal."
1,Belkin F5L001 laptop cooler is it disposable?,Arrived smelling like it was on fireOil stain on inside card board packaging?Is very loud with fan onFoot that supports on desk collapses with any movement of laptop.Fan vent on bottom design sucks in clothingUSB wire and connector looks like it cost 1 penny to make.Reminds me of the disposable 3d glasses they give at 3d movies.Returning this item for something else.
2,Don't Buy This Laptop Fan,"This laptop fan was completely fine at first. Unfortunately, only 2 weeks after I bought it, one of the fan blades broke off. This makes the fan horribly loud. And then 3 weeks later, ANOTHER fan blade broke off. Now it sounds like a helicopter taking off whenever I use it. I should have just bit the bullet and bought the nicer, slightly more expensive one; at least it would last longer. The fan is cheap and there's a reason for that. Like they always say, you get what you paid for. Don't buy this laptop fan, seriously."
2,Broken,"This cooled down my 17"" laptop fairly well, but it only worked for maybe 2 months then gave out. Also, before breaking it became REALLY loud. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
1,Avoid this fan!,"I've had this model of cooling fan for two months. At first, it did an OK job at cooling...it prevented my HP from overheating (but it was still very hot!). About a month into owning it, however, the fan became incredibly loud and started rubbing against the plastic inside. Then, right around the second month, it died for good, and no amount of prodding or cleaning it can convince the thing to work. It's a horribly designed product, and you're better off either investing more in a better one, or investing less in one of the cheaper ones that you can afford to replace every month or so. Whatever you do, DO NOT buy this product!"
1,the quick and the dead,Seemed to work at first. Fan would stop occasionally. Then the stand part of it completely broke. Out of nowhere.
3,"Gets the job done, but not durable","Even though this mat was intended for smaller laptops than my 17"" MacBook Pro, it still got the job done for cooling my aging laptop, which has now grown prone to crashing from overheating.The design of this cooling mat is best suited for a desk-setting, not adviseable for laps or the couch. My cooling mat worked for about three weeks before it died, possibly due to hair and dust getting jammed in the fan. It is moderately noisy, though when coupled with my own laptop's internal fan, can get a bit noisy.Yes, it works, but no it is not going to last a very long time depending on how you use it."
2,the belkin f5l001 is poorly made.,fan blades flew apart within 10 minutes use/the stand for computor works fine/it helps hide the plug in cord for the fanhave a nice day
1,Danielle W.,"We bought the product and thought it worked very well at cooling the computer down. After only two months, however, it stopped working last night. I wish I had read some of these reviews before purchasing the product. Spent nearly $30 for it. Will look for my receipt to return it."
1,Only good in the begiining,"This worked well in the beginning but does not fit bigger laptops too well. First, the rubber grips were easily damaged and the fan stopped working properly after a couple of weeks. Now it makes an unbearable buzzing noise and doesn't work half the time."
2,Not really worth it.,"I have to admit, I was pretty excited to get this, the reviews were not that bad, but once I used it for 2 days, I regretted my decision in buying this item. It is not designed to sit on your lap, nor is it for any surface that is either fabric or cushioned. The one fan does not do a very good job at dissipating the computers heat, and when I left it on my cushioned table the fan burnt out in less that 20 minutes. Now I find myself looking for a new one."
4,Perfect For Keeping A Laptop Cool - Not For Use Directly On Lap!,"First, let's just make it perfectly clear that this device isn't some complicated or magic cooling device. It's a plastic stand that is curved to allow air to move under your laptop. If that doesn't give you the cooling you need, you can plug in the USB fan and get extra added cooling. The fan is not whisper quiet, but I have never found it to be oppressively loud either.I guess it has to be noted due to the negative reviews here, but this device needs to sit on a table or some other flat / solid surface. I have a little laptop desk that this sits perfectly on top of.I've been using this stand for about a year, it's still in good shape and keeps my 15"" Macbook Pro nice and cool. For the price, you can't beat it for keeping your laptop cool."
1,Piece of crap,Don't waste your money. Fan blades started breaking off 1st day I had it and continued to break off from there. Two fan blades left another broke today. Cheap quality for how much you pay for it.
1,Don't waste your time.,"It started making loud noises about a few weeks after purchase, maybe less. The first day I used it, my legs were already hurting. In order for proper air to be expelled from the fan, it needs to be elevated from your lap, hence the shaped stands attached to the bottom. However, they're not padded at all and cut into your legs even if you have a standard sized laptop weight-wise. Feels very cheap, not durable. Save up and spend your money on something better."
3,"It WAS perfect, but...","First time, It was COOL!!, It was perfect, but few month later, there are some noise in the fan."
4,Good cooling pad,"I bought this cooling pad for my Toshiba laptop and it is working good to keep the laptop cool. My laptop used to shut down abruptly due to overheating which was a major problem. I would say that the cooling pad has reduced this problem by 90%, since it still shuts down sometimes. I gave a 4 star to it since it is not comfortable to use on the lap! And that beats the purpose of the laptop. Overall, it is a good buy."
3,a Hit but also a Miss,"Generally, I really like the stand but it's a tiny bit unstable at times and it works better (for me) when I use is backwards... but you have to stare at the USB cord that way. I use a 12"" MacBook so my problems might just be because my laptop is on the smaller size. Functionally, it fixed the problem of my computer overheating so i'm really happy about that. I did a decent about of research on these types of products and this sounds like the best one... I'd buy it again."
1,Broke after 1 month,"Had it for about 1 month and two of the blades broke off. Now it spins ""lop-sided"" and sounds terrible. Would not recommend this cooling pad at all."
2,Should have trusted my experience with Belkin products,"Bought it for work and got it through the Corporate Express / Staples catalog...unfortunately this is one and only laptop cooler they carry. Technically cooler does work as it brings down my MacBook Pro 15.4"" by a good 10C. The fan blows air direct at the bottom of my MBP and vents out to the sides. On average I'm running below 50C while working on non-graphic stuff which is not bad at all. But here are the cons: 1) it's noisy as hell; the noise level is almost equivalent to running my internal fans up to 6000 rpm, 2) the ergonomic is horrible and there is no way to adjust the tilt angle, 3) it's made with cheap plastic; the back legs could collapse if you accidentally bump into your laptop. Overall, Belkin continues to disappoint me so only 2 stars..."
2,Noisy!,"I bought this cooler based on the advice of a knowledgeable friend. As expected, it does cool well.It's 8 weeks old, and I can no longer use it in public - the noise it generates bothers anyone within about 10 feet. It's so annoying, I'm now shopping for a replacement."
2,good design poor componets,"the design seems to be fairly simple, create a bit of space between the laptop and the fan to allow for the airflow to be evenly distributed. mine worked great until the fan started making a horrible sound, and did not work. I would attribute this to super cheap low quality chinese manufactured fan.Also, the USB power system may seem attractive, but it puts a good deal stress on your machines power system. people don't understand that the main purpose if USB it to move information not to power everything under the sun. yes, usb does provide power to our accessories, however it should be used wisely. So, I would do one of 2 things one look for one with an a/c power unit, or if its usb make sure that you connect it to a POWERED (via ac adapter) usb hub."
2,Not so good for MacBook Pro,"The Belkin Cooling Stand looks great, but is ineffective. For my MacBook Pro (an older one, which runs very hot), it hardly drops the temperature at all. Also, the fan is very noisy. The ""leg"" in back of the stand, to hold it up, is flimsy and sometimes falls down. Not something you want to happen when your valuable computer is on the stand. Another thing missing is a switch - so to turn it off (because of its noise) you have to pull the USB plug."
1,Nice while it lasted...,"I've owned this cooling pad for approximately three months. While it worked, the product did a decent job cooling my laptop (4/5 stars). However, this product will not win any awards for its build quality. For the past several days, the fan started to act up, making a horrendous racket that caused the cooling pad to vibrate. I've heard this problem before with one of the fans in a harddrive enclosure. Problem is, the harddrive enclosure is more than three years old. I expected to receive more than 90 days of service from this Belkin product."
1,Piece of crap,"The fan blades broke after a few weeks. You can't use it on a flat surface without putting up the annoying little stand on the back that wants to fall over constantly - otherwise the laptop will squish the fan to the casing, and it will make a loud rubbing noise, which is probably what broke the cheap little fan blades.. waste of money"
1,Fan blades break easily (bought 2 of these),"We bought one of these, and the fan blades broke after 1 days use. We returned it to the store, and picked up a second. Those blades lasted a month. The design is very poor, and these blades will probably continue to break.The cooler also fits awkwardly on your lap, because of the way the cord exits the cooler. As a mechanical engineer, I consider this a very poor design."
2,Loud and inefficient,This device is very loud and doesn't concentrate the fan in any specific area. There are better products out there for the price that allow you to target the hot areas with fans.
3,keeps the laptop cool . . . in the center,the belkin cooling pad does a very good job on blowing cool air to the laptop. but my laptops ram and hard drive are located near the outside border of my laptop. the belkin is able to cool down the SMART senser in my laptop which stops the internal fan which overheats my hard drive and ram. Warning: this cooling pad is not entirely universal as it may seem.
4,Quiet; as quiet as you could expect a fan to be,"This product does the job well. It is quiet as far as cooling fans go and it is effective at keeping the laptop cool. The grips on the bottom of the stand help it stay in place. Overall, good product. If I ever need another cooling fan, I definitely will look at Belkin first."
2,NOISY!!!!,"Got this for my husband for Christmas 2008. It made it about a year before the fan started getting noisy. It sounded like the fan was hitting another plastic piece inside the unit. I couldn't take the noise anymore so I got him a new one for Father's Day 2010. THREE MONTHS later, same thing started occuring. This time only at startup and it eventually stops after he bangs on it several times. I can't take it anymore so it's time to search out a different brand all together.I will say that my husband's laptop fit nicely (it's an older Toshiba tablet, a 14""-15"" screen I think). The unit does cool well - the air blows out the sides and I got chilled by it whenever I sat next to him on the couch when he's using it."
4,Great laptop cooler,"Got for my daughter's laptop. Very quiet, works great. Gripping surface keeps laptop in place. Simple efficient design and low price. Stores easily in a laptop bag.**Only suggestion would be on/off switch instead of having to pull usb plug.(but haven't found any with switch anywhere else either)Would recommend this item."
4,Cooling Stand Review,"Small, very convenient and tilts laptop keyboard to great typing position for our daily work. However, it has begun to make a very loud noise upon startup - lasting minutes! The fan apparently has a problem that does go away after running minutes into the startup but not again during any powered situation.Seems to be the right design for cooling too. Would be nice to have a couple more USB connections available."
4,Keeps the computer nice and cool,"When I first obtained my laptop, I was worried about it overheating, so I did not use it for more than two or three hours at a time previous to shutting it down. After purchasing and using this product, I fell more comfortable with leaving it on for longer times and worry much less about it breaking down."
1,"works, but poor design","This works well to cool my small (14"") laptop, but the overall design seems poor and the construction cheap. The fan is quiet enough (current ownership:2 weeks; we'll see if it's still alive in 3 months), but the convex bottom means that you have to be very careful in choosing a surface on which to place the fan. Something soft, e.g. bed, will completely smother the fan intake; something hard, e.g. knee, will actually bend the weak plastic fan covering until it hits the fan blades.Obviously this was built for use on a flat desk surface, with the fan ""feet"" extended; however, even here, you have to be careful - move the fan without holding the rear foot bar and it folds back up, usually in the process crimping the USB cable as well.'-----------Followup: the feet broke a few months later, and the entire platform became useless. I now the Logitech N200 laptop cooler and it's MUCH sturdier. Spend the extra money and get something that works."
4,Laptop Holder,"It works exactly as I thought it would. Keeps the laptop off the desk and allows air under the computer so it doesn't get hot. Also gives you a better viewing and typing angle. I never use the fan option, but it's there if you need it."
3,"Great... for awhile, but eventually started having problems.","I had great luck with this product for about 6 months. I used it either on a desk, tray or laptop desk so it was always on a flat surface and the airflow was working properly. I have a 17"" MacBook Pro and it would get HOT!! This fan really did keep it cool and I was very happy with it. It's about 6 months later of fairly regular use (not always every day, but quite a bit) and the something broke inside and the fan still runs but it makes a horrible loud noise the whole time... and I don't think the fan is spinning very fast. So, I'm not sure if 6 months is a good lifespan for these things, but that's the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars... because I have to buy another one."
1,Annoying piece of junk,"Listen to the other people who liked this thing initially only to have it cack out after three months. Mine did exactly the same: it worked well for a while, modulo the flimsy kick stand (which, by the way, inevitably folds up when you slide it back on the desk, dropping your laptop an inch or so). After three months the fan started getting noisier on startup until it sounded like an electric pencil sharpener, and the startup noise lasted longer and longer. At six months the thing is barely usable. I've already opened it up and messed around inside to try to alleviate the problem, which works for a while, but now it's back to its old antics. Save yourself the aggravation and stay away from this item."
5,A Wonderful Book Of Poetry,Material Things Don't Matter is a wonderful collection of poetry. Saundra McFarland has created a vast array of religious poetry that will touch your heart and soul. If you like poetry this is a must read book by a very talented author. I highly recommend this book and give it five stars.
2,His Worst Video,This movie was terrible I love Jeff Foxworthys comedy so I gave him 2 stars but this movie is not an actual concert it is country music with Alan Jackson but the redneck christmas is kindly funny get Jeff in totally comitted if you want to laugh.
3,What's The Big Deal?,"After clicking to this book to leave a review, I almost decided not to after reading the reviewer from Tuscon below whose comments so closely echoed those I'd intended to leave, right down to this being the first work by Bellow I'd read. Let me then save space and simply adopt them by reference. I add that while I hardly found this book to be fluffy, I found myself asking ""Is that all there is?"" when done. This book actually made me wonder if perhaps editors can (understandably) be cowed into being too lenient and light-handed when established masters submit lesser works after their reputations have been made. Far be it from me to pass judgment on Bellow from this one work (I'm presently quite enjoying The Dean's December and have Augie March waiting in the wings) but I don't think The Actual will win the fight for a permanent space in my library."
2,I was disappointed,"I was very excited to be able to sit down and read this book last night, but found myself an hour later with the book finished before I felt that it had started. There were a few good lines, but nothing that made me want to stop and reflect. It would have made a good first section of a novel, but the characters never developed enough for my taste."
3,"Good, but definitely not great","This novella, to me, was very hilly in that every 7 pages or so, Bellow would write anything between a line and a page that were perfectly brilliant, but the pages in between seemed to just go on and on about the lives of socialites and rich Chicago Jewish families.This wasn't particularly enthralling, and I suppose that I had higher expectations for the actual prose used in the novella, but overall I felt that the story, if somewhat delayed, was satisfying and altogether not a bad read."
2,Coming and Going,"Mr. Bellow could successfully narrate a continuous yarn in an easy manner. His is an effortless tale of a man's coming of age that somewhat involves the high life of the elites. Very secretive he is about himself but with enormity of outlooks on others around him, usually with an utterly dry sense of humor. There might be some deeper meanings that could be perceived of the happenings recounted. A much artier person might understand the gist. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those on this writing. The novella is a good pastime but not one of my favorites. Yet, I enjoy the way the story flows from start to finish."
3,Better Late Than Never,"Bellow's protagonist is a staid, somewhat mysterious Asian-looking character who may be based in part on Allan Bloom's travelling companion, described in Bellow's Ravelstein. Morally distanced from the characters with whom he becomes reluctantly involved, the protagonist, during a graveyard scene, risks new love with his highschool sweetheart who has eluded him in a life of successful business. The better-late-than-never involvement of the protagonist by book's may mirror Bellows' own dialectic between the writerly distance needed for objective observation and the deeper involvement in life which renders detached observation both more suspect and more difficult."
4,Very subtle very human,"This is a 103 page novella concerning Harry Trellman and his first lost love Amy Wustrin, whom he has - ""loved dumbly from the sideline for forty years.""It tells the story of their lives on the day she is exhuming her ex-husband to re-bury him in a Chicago cemetery.Its short, but full of wonderful little observations on life by Bellow. A lot is made of missed opportunities either through fate or our ability as humans to make wrong decisions.It tells of the highs and lows in the lives of the two main characters and those on the periphery, its a delightful read, and a decent length bath will see it taken care of."
1,People Don't Know THe GOods,I find it hard to believe that no one has rated this album. Maybe birddog is more of a ghostdog to the majority.
5,Worth a try,"I just received it, plugged it in and turned the gain u as high as it can go. There was a marked difference in the signal strength. A channel that I had lost after the digital transition (for some weird reason) was again watchable.I heard some people say that positioning is not important with this antenna. For me, that is an untrue statement. Rotating the antenna a few degrees meant the difference between picking up a channel and receiving nothing at all.Each case is unique. Some people live in terrible places and will not be able to receive strong digital signals until television stations do signal strength audits and decide to invest in increasing their coverage (i'm sure their revenue dollars are hurt by lost viewership - so it is in their best interest to make their signal as strong as possible.Though an inaccurate measure for me, this page may be helpful for you to determine whether or not you need a stronger antenna or whether you need to buy a basic cable subscription.[...]"
1,RCA Indoor Amplified Antenna,The antenna worked about the same as no antenna at all. There was no difference when plugged in and powered up. Either the unit was defective or it was just a bad product.
2,Not that great...at all.,"I bought this antenna because I cannot get local channels through my satellite tv provider. I don't even get all of my local channels and the ones that I do get look terrible! I've had better luck with just regular ""rabbit ears"". I live 15 miles from the broadcast stations."
1,Very poor signal reception,I bought this antenna hoping to watch local HD broadcast in my area. It turned out that the antenna didn't help at all. The HD signals received keeps fading in and out so bad that I couldn't watching anything more than 1 minute without loosing the signal.
2,trying too hard,"constantine simply tries too hard at the dialoguelacks the intellectual vigor to pull it offannoying, distracting, and boringi will finish the book only as a personal challange"
5,seeing she will be my sister-n-law i must be bias awesome!,"SHE A VERY BEAUTIFUL PERSON ON THE INSIDE AS WELL AS THE OUTSIDE AND SHE DOES HAVE THE ""STUFF""IT TAKES TO MAKE IT IN THIS COLD-HEARTED,RUN YOU TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION, THEY CALL MUSIC INDUSTRY, BUT SHE IS AWESOME ALL AROUND, AND I WISH MY SIS-N-LAW ALL THE BEST AND MY LOVE......"
1,Are you familiar with preterism?,"If you are familiar with preterist doctrine then you won't find anything new here. If you don't know what preterism is then you might want to read this book. Half of this book consists on an appendix of historical citations, which are the writings of Josephus."
3,All in All a pretty good card,"I bought several of these cards to install in computers at my office. Most of the installs went without a hitch but two of the computers have been having on and off problems with the card. Sometimes the computer will boot up and say that it has found new hardware in the form of an Ethernet controller, no matter what drivers I throw at it, it says that none of them are the right drivers for the device. Upon rebooting the computer though everything works fine again. All machines are running Windows XP Pro with similar hardware so I'm not sure why only two computers are having problems. The drivers are not Windows Certified so that might have something to do with it. All in all a pretty good card and works great most of the time. Again, I've only had a problem on two out of ten machines so it isn't a major problem. Just thought I would mention this stuff, hopefully Belkin writes a better driver soon."
1,A Dog of a Game. The Developers Should be Horse Whipped.,"If you are like me, and tend to disbelieve other reviewers who can't make a game run, caveat emptor. They may not be, in fact, dumber than you. I have found this out the hard way.This game does not work. It does not work on any of 4 separate and up to date platforms. The only thing it does consistantly is crash.The people who made this game shoud be horse whipped for making my little girl cry. And shame on Amazon for selling garbage like this."
2,Very confusing and time goes way too fast for enjoyment,I was very disappointed with this. With little explanation or useful manual the time goes so fast it's hard to find a way to play enjoyably. Would not recommend to anyone. Not even any useful online support. It's way too confusing for a preteen or even younger.
4,Pretty Good!,"I bought this game for Christmas and it was fantastic! The graphics aren't that great, but you get to breed, buy, sell, and train horses. You get to enter races and when money, but you can only own three horses at a time. You can free ride and go in the water. But you're horse can get too stessed and buck you off. I would recommend this for someone who isn't picky about graphics and likes to play video games!-by the way this is her daughter! :D"
1,Amazon is shipping EXPIRED not valid MSDN Professional Subsr,"Just received MSDN Subscription 7.0 Professional Upgrade that cannot be activated.According to Microsoft, MSDN retailers were told about the product with older activation code that will not be valid back in 06/2004.But Amazon is still shipping out this expired product which is NO GOOD.I have to wait 3 more weeks to get MSDN.What a hassle."
1,Attack of the Octopus People - Alpha Video,"I was very disappointed with this movie. The movie does not have professional actors. The movie is definitely of bad taste. The octopus head is a balloon. The movie is in black and white, giving the impression that it was made in the 50s or 60s, but it was not. The movie lasts for only 43 minutes. It is not a full-length movie. The bonus movie ""Frankenstein Versus Hitler"" is even worse. It is a silent black and white movie, giving the impression that it was made in the 1920s, but it was made that way on purpose. The dead corpses look like plastic dolls. I certainly cannot recommend these movies. I watched the movie for a few minutes and then I kept on moving it forward to see different scenes and it was all very displeasing. Don't bother to order. You will be throwing your money away. Don't listen to those positive comments. I listened to them and now I am disappointed."
5,Extremely Nostalgic and Great Fun!,"Godzilla: Save the Earth was one of the first games I greatly enjoyed on the PS2. It features smooth controls, a great variety of playable monsters, a great variety of moves, and a great variety of stages. Graphically it is very good for a PS2 game. The controls and speed of combat capture the feel of Kaiju films, and the monsters are true to their film appearances. Overall, I would highly recommend this game to any Kaiju fan, fighting game fan, or even a casual gamer looking for a unique experience."
5,Godzilla: finally a Great Must Own Game!,"Wow was I surprised when I played this!!! the selection of monsters is HUGE also great destructable environments! power up's and tons of extras to keep you coming back for more. godzilla hasn't looked this great ever in motion picture history with all the Great Sound Effects of the creatures! definately a sweet fighter, a great godzilla game and wonderfully done my only gripe was the lock on system, its a tad off because when you ""lock on"" and launch a special attack like breat weapon etc it does NOT auto aim at the target you MUST be facing the target to hit it with a lock on otherwise a Stellar title!Graphics: 5 of 5 easily. godzilla and friends are beautifully rendered in this game!Sound: Supreme creature sounds otherwise above avg. 4 1/2 starsFun and Replayability: 5 star! Tons of unlockable monsters, arenas, cities, and concept art and tons more including minigames! this title will keep you coming back for more with ease!Godzilla: Save the Earth"
4,Second Godzilla game takes all,"When I got Godzilla: Destroy all monsters, I didn't know what to expect. I was disapointed. However, this second game is much better. You get many more monsters, instead of earning them, you can buy them! This feature is very nice because you can buy the most powerful monster(Space-Godzilla) first if you want! Another nice feature is the challange mode. In action mode, you do 1 every 3 or 4 battles. It can be to save a sky-scraper from alien attack, or swimming under water to fight a submarian! You can also play bowling or basketball! This game has a lot more sweet features,so many I can't say them all! This game took me on one heck of a ride, probobly you to, so, to take the trip, play Godzilla: Save the Earth!"
4,THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!,"""Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Mele"" is one of my favorite games of all time with it's graphics, characters, and more. So when I heard about a sequel(thanks to Tohokingdom.com), I started smiling like a clown! There are more playable characters(and Kiryu is coming to the american version, yes!), more modes, better graphics, and kaiju charts(to see how good your character is)! I can't wait for the game. The only reason I put four in overall is because one, it's not out yet so I haven't played it and two, it's not on Gamecube(which is, in my opinion, the best fighting game system)."
5,Godzilla's 50th Birthday present,"This game is a sequel to Atari/Pipeworks G:DAMM for GC and XBOX. It's suppose to be amazing! there are action levels with mission objectives,challenge modes, and so far, 19 monsters have been confirmed! cool,eh? I can't wait for them to release it in November! Awesome!"
5,Let's Get Ready To Crumble!!!!!!,"This is truley one of the most awesome games ever put on system, it could've been better and all but at least it's a cool game! When I got sick on Easter my dad rented this for me because I wanted the Incredibles and Tony Hawks Underground 2 but they didn't have it."
3,why and why not buy this game,0ne reason to buy this game is because another godzilla game godzilla unleashed has more monsters an awsome storyline.One reason to buy save the earth is that one extra monster but its much of differents but you should buy both.
3,Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is cool. The reason I rated it in the overall thing 4 is because Destreyah can not fly and They also have have plot holes in action mode, but I don,t really care."
5,Great fun,"Yes, I know the game is somewhat limited but I play this with my eight year old son and we have a great time. This game isn't really meant for the hardcore gamers. It is meant for the next generation of hardcore gamers. It's training wheels for future serious games. But for what it is and meant to be, a game for fahters and sons to play together, I have to give it five stars. Besides, Godzilla, in any area of play, is just darn cool."
3,Instructions are not clear. Can't get it to gather.,"This is a really nifty idea, and it works really well for making pleats, but I can not get it to gather. Everytime I put it on the setting for Gather it makes a big knot in one spot, and that's it. The instructions are very small, and not clear in my opinion. There is really no where that I have found for instructions online either. So unless you already know how to use this, or have someone who can show you I think you may end up very frustrated (like me)."
5,Great sewing,It was different from the other rufflers that I have but it didn't take long to get lovely looking ruffles.
4,It Works!,"It took some time to figure out how it works, and ultimately some help from [...], but I made ruffles. The price can't be beat."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I have a Low Shank Snap-On Singer Sewing Machine and I thought this would work with it. It doesn't, this seems to be built for an older style machine with the screw on feet."
2,3 months of use is all I got,"I chose this shovel based on the brand and overall good reviews. After using the shovel for three months, the scoop now has a 5 inch crack down the middle. This is likely to continue to grow with more use breaking the shovel in two. This is from normal use removing snow from my sidewalk and driveway."
1,Too brittle of a pliastic,Wood shaft makes the shovel heavier than a plastic shaft. The plastic compound is too brittle to be used for shoveling snow.
3,worked great last year...,This shovel worked great last year. Shovels a ton of snow quick regardless of ergonomics. However the reason I am writing this review is I just broke it straight down the middle. There was only an inch of snow outside and I was just walking along pushing some snow in front of out house door and it snapped with one hand pushing. Guess I will go metal next time.
2,When You Need to Shovel a Lot of It,"The True Temper shovel did the trick for me. I needed a high volume delivery shovel to move the large amounts of leaves that fall from my 150 year old oak tree. The shovel holds four times more than the ones I already owned.The quality seemed good at first. Now I notice that after owning it for one month and using it 3 times to shovel leaves, the plastic D handle is cracked. Not a sign of good quality. Also, I cannot see any indication of where it was made. Suspect it is of Chinese origin.Easy John"
3,Not too bad...,"I DID enjoy this book, and I really loved the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery mixed with a little romance.One thing that really annoyed me, however, was that this book kept referring to one of the characters from the first two books in this series as ""Brett"" (should be Brooke). If you've read the first two books, you probably caught this right away, too. I certainly didn't forget the characters names. How did the author???"
1,dark angel by karen harper,i only like the amish love inspired book also would like to join a book club if i could only recievice amish books
4,Great product,"The material is of a high quality, it is pleasant to touch. Also, the penguin is really lovely. This is a perfect gift for animal and especially penguin lovers."
5,Baby Emporer Penquin webkinz,This little guy is really cute. I purchased him for each of my nephews. They seemed to really like it as well.
1,A cheap top that is cheaply made,"The title says it all... A cheap top that is cheaply made, but the dog thought it was a wonderful chew toy."
4,"Darling toy, soft, durable","We bought the baby after owning several ""adult"" Emperor penguins by Aurora. They are the best. Plush and soft, without that unpleasant ""synthetic"" hand-feel. They all survived several machine washings. I would put them in a mesh bag or pillowcase to wash, as one penguin's eyes got scuffed in the washer. I have only one complaint about the baby penguin: the black part of the eye eventually wore or washed off, making him look like he had no pupils, and I had to re-draw that part on with a Sharpee pen - the only reason for less than a perfect rating."
5,"Love it, soft and cuddly","I purchased this for my 2 year old. He is currently obsessed with penguins. This is so soft it was a fast favorite, perfect size to snuggle in bed with for a little boy."
4,A Good Buy,"I bought this toy for a toddler under two and it has held up in the few months we've had it so far. She's pretty tough on it, so I would say it's well made."
3,AURORA PENGUIN,THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING A WEBKINZ PENGUIN. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF FOR NOT READING BETTER. GRANDDAUGHTER ALSO DISAPPOINTED AT CHRISTMAS
5,Cute,I got this for my girlfriend. It is small and cute and made of durable material. I would recommend it as a cheap gift to remind someone you love them!
5,Very cute!,This little penguin is adorable and Very soft!!! I bought it as a christmas present for my cousin and se absolutely loved it!!
4,Soft and cute,"I gave this to my sister as a gift. She loved it. It is just as cute as the picture. It is nice and soft. She adores this. I think for the price this is a good deal, especially if you have free shipping."
1,not a webkinz,"this product was listed with all the webkinz products, so I thought I was getting a webkinz for my son."
1,Came sewn together improperly,"I purchased this stuffed animal penguin as a gift, upon opening the box I knew that something was wrong with it at first sight, but couldn't put my finger on it. After comparing the item picture online, and the product I got, his eyes were sewn in, incorrectly. His left eye was sewn 90 degrees off from where it was supposed to be, and its right eye was about 80 degrees off, so the slits were facing straight up and down, or mostly up and down. I was able to repaint the eyes (as a last minute fix) but was dissatisfied that I needed to try to make any corrections on it at all. Quality control is not up to standard in my opinion."
5,Cute little happy feet,This is absolutely the cutest plush baby penguin ever! It will not disappoint you. The face is so adorable that you don't know whether to laugh or cry. Totally precious and highly recommended.
4,Smaller than I thought,"It says it's 8 inches, but it's closer to 7. The eyes are kind of weird looking in person, but the toy is very soft, and I still think it's cute."
5,Great one to have,My wife got this for her niece when she was 2. She loved it and never let it go for nearly a year. Its still in good condition and she plays with it. Good to have for all kids. of ages 2/3.
5,Get this guys.,My girlfriend loved it. For a split second she thought it was real. It's really soft to touch. A great gift for someone who loves penguins.
5,A journey,"Talbot opens the book with an introduction that gives the reader some idea of where he's going. The first several chapters lay down a quick ground work, introducing the reader to the old physics' universal precepts. He then goes into what new areas of quantum research are uncovering and postulating, and ties it in with mostly eastern mystical thought: Tantra, Buddhism, and the in-betweens. He makes references to specific cases, specific theories, and specific thinkers, past and present. The work is overall well written and well cited, very coherent and unesoteric. I recommend the book to anyone looking for an explaination for what they can't explain and who is not satisfied with occidental mythoi."
4,"An easy, accessible, fun, quick read...","Well! This is an easy, enjoyable book guided lightly in equal parts by both simple plot and simple character. It is finely written, but it is not a ""deep"" book -- in fact, it reads like young adult fiction. (It may be that it is, I didn't check before I read it.) I had the quintessential ""nice time"" reading it -- but it never became interesting, challenging, or complex enough for it to have much staying power. Still, Patricia McKillip has a place in my heart for producing pleasant, engaging, simple stories. Or, I should say, simply STORIES: unpretentious and pleasurable to read. All her books are like warm milk, or a vanilla wafer. :-)"
3,Not her best,"I feel rather guilty writing a so-so review when it seems that so many others loved this book, but I was a little disappointed. With McKillip it seems to be hit or miss. I've books of hers that I've absoltuely loved and others with which I was even more disappointed than I was here. This time around, I felt as if the book were written from outside an impenetrable bubble. There was a sort of fuzziness surrounding the action and the climactic events of the book, a disconnection from what was really going on. It was occassionally hard to decipher what was actually happenning, and the basis and dynamics of several relationships did not seem to logically follow. Just one person's opinion, others seemed to really enjoy the novel, but I didn't. I didn't relly dislike it, per se, but I'll certainly never read it again."
2,For cannibal film fans and Franco completists,"This is one of those cannibal movies Franco made in the early 1980s, and if you've seen any of the others, you know what to expect. If you haven't it's your average low budget cannibal movie. Buy this movie if you fall into one of these two categories: A) cannibal movie lovers, or B) Jess Franco completists. It doesn't have much of Franco's trademark directing styles and is not for those who prefer his psychedelic films or his sexploitation movies of the late 60s and early 70s."
3,Nude Jungle Girl Runs Through Jungle,"The DVD cover is the only non-topless part of the movie. I think you do have to watch almost 3 seconds into the film before a closeup of her breast. There is a plot about some sort of jungle takeover but mostly it concerns this white girl who was lost in the jungle and now is the leader of her tribe and we can be thankful for two things - no one cares she's topless and she resists all efforts to cover her up during several kidnappings and ""tarzan"" like plot points as she escapes back to the jungle. Don't come for the plot, just stay for the nudity. Is it a great film? - no, of course not. But what's wrong with wall to wall jungle girl toplessness plus many other women topless ... not brilliant but solid entertainment for the topless jungle babe genre."
1,rare french sleaze,"worthwhile only as the opposite of anything from respectable french directors like renior, godard, resnais, you name um....the french aren't exactly known for their sleaze.the french also aren't known for their good b-movies either...this '80s movie is like a less-professional 1960s drive in movie, aimed at teen boys, since this movie is about a topless teen girl living in a jungle.there's an interview with a french producer, and ads for more french junk, so if you can buy this dvd for cheap, it's a passable curio."
1,Worst Customer Service By Far,"I had Cricket as my provider for about 6 months. Even though they have unlimited plans, their customer service was terrible and not worth the hassle. They have a policy of charging you $0.55 for receiving paper bills, which I tried to terminate from the 1st month and every month there after but they never stopped coming. After my service was canceled my bank account continued to be automatically debited one month after. I called to resolve the problem but the customer service representative was not cooperative. Never got my money back."
2,WOW this is bad,"I picked this book up at a used book store -- boy am I glad I didn't pay full price !!I totally agree with tracy vest review--too many pages dedicated to same old same old sex. So much it got in the way of the story. I would have like to see it reversed with lot's of story and some good steamy sex scenes. ALSO, I was totally lost on whether this was Earth in the future with all that magic or another planet, or under the radar magic on Earth today???? Where was this? There was no background explanations on what, where, when all this magic took place. This is going back to the used book store as a trade in for maybe another better author. Definately not going on my re-read shelf"
3,Cute,Cute book the story is nice but a little confusing at times. The sex scenes are very steamy which I think is only the best parts in the book.
5,Eye-Opener,I could not put this book down once I began to read it. I found it very informative as to what could happen when you meet someone over the Internet. I just hope that someone can gain insight and knowledge from reading Paulette's book. It is easy to understand and never boring! Good job Paulette. I'm ready for your next book!
2,learn how to write before you write a book,"For the first several chapters I was shocked at the poor writing style. Every paragraph was filled with sentences that were not varied and showed a juvenile way of writing as if she were a high school student. Even her opinions sounded very immature; ""she seemed stuck up"" was one of those descriptions. There were sentences that ended in a period that weren't complete sentences and should have been a continuation of the previous sentence. Amazing! Once she got going into the heart of the story, it got a little better but the author still doesn't seem to know when a chapter should end and a new one begin. I can't imagine that she can be writing another book. Take some college level courses and learn how to write on the level of someone who gets published."
5,A MUST Read!,"It is impossible to mention all that is good in this book. The one thing that I can't emphasize enough, is the author's picturesque descriptions of characters with details that make you want to read the next sentence, hanging onto every last word. This author definitely has a knack for writing stories that seem to absorb right into your skin. For me, this book was almost impossible to put down and I look forward to reading more books by this author!"
1,RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!,"This book is AWFUL! I wish I could have given it negative stars, but the minimum is 1 star! What kind of title is this anyway? Who exactly are you targeting with Hypnosis, gambling, internet dating AND spousal abuse all in the title?? I think anyone who buys this book must be crazy!! I doubt this will be a best seller........."
2,Disappointed,A friend of mine let me borrow a garden hoe like this one and I just loved it (it was quite old). This Ames product is a disappointment. It is very hard to get the same results as from the one I borrowed. I really have to push on the Ames product to get it into the dirt and under the weeds. I have asked my friend to sharpen it for me. Somehow I did not expect to have to improve the product's performance.
1,rivets not bolts,The picture on Amazon and on the Ames web site shows the hoe to be bolted together. It is not bolted. It is riveted!. Cheap. Do not buy this product and I will not buy anything from Ames again.
5,Essential tool for any Microsoft developer,"If you develop software for Microsoft platform, you can't live without it.On this package you will get everything, form Windows to Visual Studio, passing by all the servers and productivity applications from Microsoft that are relevant to our work.Also, with this package you can get things before they hit the shelves. I got Visual Studio .NET 2002 one month before its launch, Windows Server 2003 almost one month too and Visual Studio .NET 2003 more than two weeks before it.You receive tons of documentation, SDK, samples and help material...A must have."
3,"""Activation code already being used""","MSDN is probably essential if you develop software for Windows, but I had a problem activating my subscription online. The activation page says my subscription number is currently being used. Be prepared to mail in your activation request (no fax, no web), sending in the activation card, the top of the box, and invoice. After paying over two grand, I still need to wait up to 10 days to start using my subscription. Looks like there is a security problem with the activation numbers. For the cost of the subscription, it should be quicker to activate, notwithstanding the securty issue. After all, Microsoft seems to be letting someone else use my subscription for free--why not me too?"
3,"Good Product, Poor Purchase Experience","I had the same problem as one of the other reviewers, my activation number was already in use, so I had to talk to Microsoft and send it out by a carrier (Top of the box, invoice & subscription card). When they received it, they called me at my office and noticed that I wasnt on the U.S. Even though I was going to receive MSDN in Texas, they told me that if I was to use this product in México I would be violating the license agreement. They didnt even told if there was a similar product for foreign countries... So now, my Subscription belongs to another person in Texas. Bu."
5,The 7.0 Release,"You can no longer register the 6.0 release with MS.. and have to pay the difference.For the price it is the most amazing piece of software you can get your hands on, especially if you wish to stay on the bleeding edge of technology"
1,Product does not contain valid activation code,"The first copy that I received did not contain a valid 25-digit activation code. As such, Microsoft would not activate my subscription. I asked for a replacement product to arrive. It too did not contain a valid 25-digit activation code.According to Microsoft, they switched to the 25-digit activation code in March. Until they start stocking versions with the 25-digit activation code, I cannot recommend purchasing the product from Amazon.com."
1,...Shady,"7.0 subscriptions receive the exact same content as 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0 and 1.0 subscriptions. So why is the price going up...??? If I were you, I would find a 6.0 version..."
5,AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't usually review on this page, but Kid Dynamite is one of the best bands i've ever heard, and the messege they convey makes them one of my all time fav. bands. I can't wait to see them live pretty soon. If you like Punk and Hardcore, or if you like Ricky Martin, buy this cd. Why Ricky Martin, because when you listen to this, it'll make you forget about him and you'll want to go out and be yourself instead of some trendy mtv fool."
3,All songs sound too similar - but the drummer is GOD!,"This band represents perhaps the state of the art in fast, American hard core punk rock. If only they could add some humor and variety. Every song sounds the same. If your band is only as good as the drummer, Kid Dynomite is a very good band. Call up Tesco Vee for consultation."
5,"best drummer,great band",this cd is great. i like it alot. sometimes i like to put it into my cd player and listen to it. yeah. yeah. thats what i like to do.
1,Fell for the (6),"I bought 6, or so I thought, sheets of plywood. 1/4"" x 6"" x 12"" and paid a reasonable price for 6 sheets and a high price for shipping. Imagine my surprise and disgust when I got one sheet! And I'm doubly dumb because I'm waiting for a second order of supposedly 2 sets of 6 sheets of 1/8"" plywood ordered at the same time as my other order. I feel ripped off.Plywood 1/4 x 6 x 12 (6)"
1,REALIZE YOUR GETTING ONLY ONE SHEET!!!!,"misleading, misleading!!!! says in parentheses (6) implying you receive 6 sheets when all you are getting is one, making it an Extremely Expensive piece of thin plywood. what a rip offf!!!!!"
5,Trust me!!!,"If you're a fan of Elliot Smith or Badly Drawn Bow( Magic in the Air type songs), You'll love this CD. He has similar vocals(IMHO) Every song starts off nice and mellow, then finishes strong.I love the mixture of acoustic and horns in his songs. I just bought this CD last week...and it makes me wonder how much good music I'm actually missing.ScottPeace"
1,nick drake my #$%#@%,this album reeks of philly hipster. its going in the bargain bin with that ben kweller album i accidently bought. i find the comparisions to pet sounds era brian wilson and nick drake typical of the post-volkswagon commercial album buying trucker hat set.
5,5 STARS!,"I read about Bill Ricchini for months in music magazines hailing his record as the next big thing with some nice touchstones in terms of influences. The Beach Boys, Badly Drawn Boy, The Shins, Belle & Sebastian, The Kinks, The Beatles, The Smiths. I spent last summer in London where I saw it on a best of the year list and picked up a copy at a local shop and I was totally blown away. I'm glad Americans are finally getting to hear this fantastic album it really is something special. The songwriting is amazing, I love his voice and at 18 songs it's truly epic and wonderful. One of the best debut albums ever in my opinion, every song is a winner and it just gets better over repeated listens."
3,Better have some muscle..,"Dethatch your lawn with this rake ONLY if you really have to!! This tool is head heavy, so your arms will get really tired, unless you are in super shape. I will allot one week to do the front lawn. I am still sore from using it on 1/3 of the lawn. It will remove everything including green, which will leave your lawn looking terrible."
4,Excellent rake,"When I first used this tool, I raked a tiny space of my yard, approximately 3 feet by 5 feet. I ended up with a bucketful of thatch and general yard debris to remove and felt ashamed of of myself for not taking better care of my grass. Any tool that can shame me is probably a tool that does a good job. This rake is also very sturdy and solidly built. Yes, it'll take a while to de-thatch a large yard with nothing more than a handheld tool, but rest assured that the job will get done, and you will remove tons of debris with this rake."
5,Thatching Rake,Ames True Temper 1914000 Thatching rake arrived promptly. It works great at pulling out the truly thick moss in my yard. The trick is to figure out how to position oneself while using the rake. Make no mistake about it taking alot of time and energy but I found when I hold the rake square in front of me and pull equally with both arms it doesn't pull on my shoulder muscles like it would if I was using a regular leaf rake. It took alot of stamina but I was able to accomplish several hours a day without soreness. This thatching rake was a very good buy for me and I would recommend it to anyone with lots of ambition and energy.
4,Reliable effective,"I used this thatching rake on my yard and it works well, It's difficult to pull up thick dead grass but if you have a small yard it's ideal vs. renting a machine thatcher."
4,Great for cultvating.,"I have to admit that I leave lawn thatching to my lawn maintenance company, but my vegetable and flower garden plots are totally mine to enjoy. I use the rake head to clear away winter debris, and the cultivating head to loosen the soil and mix in plant nutrients. The thatching tines are just great for cultivating, although the rake head is a little too large for some of the flower beds. Nurturing flowering plants is an up front and personal thing anyway!"
4,Works very well but handle is solid wood heavy,"I didn't buy this item on Amazon, but I bought one at Home Depot. I have 3 to 4 different types of rakes from plastics to flimsy aluminum type. This one really does the job. However, be forewarn, the handle bar is heavy and you will get tired very quickly. You will most likely be able to work on a small area at a time.I only wish this rake has a lighter handle bar option like perhaps something made of aluminum or high strength plastic handle. The solid wood handle is just too heavy. For this reason, I give it only a 4 star."
4,"Good product, great results","I bought this last summer and used it once in my backyard (the whole backyard, ouch). It was quite a bit of manual labor, but the results seem to justify my efforts. I scraped bucket after bucket of dead grass from my over-thatched yard. Soon after, grass seemed to green up nicely. Some of the blades bent on my rake after use, but still seems like a pretty solid product. If you have a small yard, or a big work ethic, I would recommend this product."
4,Great for Small Patches,"This thatch rake is great for SMALL spots. If you plan on doing an entire yard, go rent a machine. It takes a LOT of effort to use this rake on Augustine grass in Texas. Having said that, the rake works as intended and is high quality / durable."
4,Adequate,"Although I had ordered this from Amazon, it had not arrived a week after it's predicted delivery date, so I cancelled the Amazon order. I did buy this item at a local Home Depot later. I found it adequate for its purpose of pulling thatch from my lawn. It's kind of heavy but not as heavy as I had imagined based on other reviews. And it's pretty effective. Be aware, of course, that by being effective at removing thatch, it will leave a hole in your lawn. You can either fill this with new grass seed or wait for existing turf to take it over. You also have some thatch to dispose of. It looks to be a good addition to a compost pile.I had read a web suggestion to use this rake to remove ground ivy. The person posting this suggestion reported the rake would pull it up by the roots. I found it ineffective for this.All in all, a useful tool for its purpose."
3,The product works well enough but I saw it cheaper at a local store,I used this rake to thatch our front lawn this fall. It was very labor intensive since we have a large front yard. I think in the feature I may try an electric thatcher to save time. I was also disappointed by the fact that I saw the same rake at my local big box store for 10 or 15 dollars cheaper.
5,5000 sounds around,"the disc is a experiment, the guy put a pile of sounds in a disc. be careful, only for a very patience sense of hearing, because the sounds progressive appears through the disc until get a climax (30 minutes aprox.) and later go down to the end (45 min.); Bob says in the box:""...there is a guitar riff somewhere..."" i never finded. so, if you like mike patton, zorn, buy it."
1,Willy Wonka CD is not sweet at all,"This music inspired by Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a real let down. I didn't enjoy one track and was surprised that it was even being marketed. With such a wonderful original motion picture soundtrack, there is no need for this recording in your music library."
4,"Nice Product, but Don't Buy from This Seller","Bought this refurbished computer for my son for Christmas. Great little computer, and in really good shape. However, we've got it in being serviced for a virus right now, and lo and behold ... it came with no back-up diskettes. No Windows 7 XP diskettes. No diskettes of ANY kind. Computer repairman says it has a pirated software package on it, so that solves the mystery of why it showed up with no diskettes. I am livid. I contacted the seller via email last week to have them send me the back-up diskettes, and they refuse to respond in any way. No return emails, no phone calls, no interest, no care, no concern, and no luck.BUYER BEWARE!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!! Because they are crooks to not only pirate the software in the first place, they are also dishonest in that they refuse to contact me to help make this problem right. I have to go BUY the software, hence another $120-$300 expense.Shame on this seller."
5,"In this bleak economy, this book offers options and hope","Someone gave me the audio book of this at a time when I needed it most. After listening to it, I found it in me to resign from my ""dream job"" and realize that it was actually a nightmare. I find myself today in a job that doesn't feel like work. I've worked the past six years here and I have to pinch myself to make sure that I'm not dreaming. Eight years after I listened to the tapes, I passed them onto a friend who was in a career in the banking industry. A couple of months ago, she found a job she loves and is making more money. I bought this book for a friend who works for the same company I do, but different department. Not only did she find a job that pays better and is closer to home within a month, she told me that this book saved her life. THIS BOOK WORKS -- DON'T KNOW HOW -- BUT IT DOES."
3,Raises a question without answering it.,"A gold star to Ms. McKenna for identifying a real and significant source of malaise for many working women. We choose to commit our all to our job. Then, after so many years, disappointments and fatigue with the politics and personalities accrue to the point where we look around and decide we want more out of our lives.Two lumps of coal. One, because nearly everything she writes should apply equally to men yet she addresses the book to women. Second, because practically the only answer she provides is to quit, as she did. (And write a book about it?). I would much have preferred interviews with people who dramatically enriched their jobs, and their lives, without quitting. How did they go about it? Where did they look for answers? What did they give up? What should change in the work place?As a manager, I'm particularly interested in whether companies will respond to this kind of need - for different responsibilities, perhaps, or retraining, or sabbaticals."
2,And then...?,"Great. So, you do as Ms. Perle McKenna did and leave the rat race. Her story ends there. Or does it? In her next book, her husband leaves her and she actually has to make a living for herself... a real living, not the ""second income"" that a wife of a wealthy man can afford to bring in.This is an interesting book which I enjoyed, but I have to say that it seems like many of the ideas found in here apply to only a lucky few..."
5,Been there---IT'S REAL.,Valerie Moreton and her proteges can accomplish six month's of therapy in one session. She is brilliant. The book says it all.It's true--we are a sum of our feelings and our spirits and our bodies. Break one and the others won't work as well. Fix one and the otherw work better. Valerie tells you how to do this. I've been there---it works.
5,great stuff!!!!!!,"i've been looking for this product for a long time (at grocery stores, etc.). had to get on line to find it!! great product for stir fries!!!! thanks a lot---bill"
1,Greatest Missed Opportunity,"Hal Blaine must have lived the most hectic life considering that his sessions were so numerous, most databases only list his #1 songs or only his Top Tens. His body of work is just that vast!! But this book never portrays, say, a day in the life of the busiest studio musician of his time. The book was done in the lamest, laziest of ways where choronology isn't even considered. Blain and his writer divvy up the book into chapters about whatever artist he happened to work with. It is one of the greatest opportunities missed because Blaine didn't want to actually do the work that a comprehensive bio would have required. The book was done so cheaply that the typos are too numerous to mention. (such as the number ""1"" appearing instead of the first-person pronoun ""I' in some instances) Lame! Lame! Lame! Do not buy this book!!! You will be thoroughly disappointed. For Shame Mr. Blaine! For Shame!"
2,Hard to disagree with other 2 or 3 star reviews,"I grew up in the 60's, so I saw Hal Blaine's name on the back of a lot of album covers. When I found this book I was anxious to read it. Unfortunately, there wasn't a whole lot that I hadn't already read in magazines. I passed the book onto my drumset instructor who is about 20 years my junior also holds a Masters Degree in Music. His comment to me was pretty much ""here's this guy who was part of one of the most significant albums of the 20th Century (Pet Sounds), and he makes almost no mention of it"". That essentially sums up this book. The books is basically fluff meant to appeal to the fans like me. My word of advice if you're serious about owning it. Don't pay list, or you'll be overpaying."
2,"Yes, it is disappointing","I have to say I ignored the negative reviews and hoped for the best. As a drummer and musicologist, I hoped and expected that Blaine's unique behind the scenes view of 30+ years of popular music-making would be enlightening. As others have already said, it's pretty light on content. And if you are looking for any kind of technical insights (from a drummer or musician's point of view), forget it, there are none to speak of. That said, it is a quick and easy read, entertaining for the most part, and the photo section is pretty cool. But as a musician's book (reader and author) it is by and large, a disappointment. Now I'm going to take the other guy's advice and buy the Earl Palmer book!"
4,Who was first: the singer or the sideman?,"Looking at the wide variety of artists that Hal Blaine has backed, looking further at all different musical styles and listening to some of the prominent recordings featuring his drums the question pops up if music is more depending on the sidemen than on who is fronting. Then again the list of artists whose recordings have benefitted from his incredible abilities is so on par that the idea may not really jell. Anyway, this autobiography, well written, informative, and sometimes funny, reveals that sidemen should be paid as much attention as the name artist. Blaine sadly has been featured on too many recordings where the labels have paid little attention to listing sidemen. Hopefully this book will be read and the contents widespread."
3,The conclusion is here.,"Yu Watase, Fushigi Yugi: Bride (Viz, 1996)Here, at last, Yu Watase wraps up Fushigi Yugi, and in the final volume, some fo the spark returns. Not all of it, mind you, but some. Everything is resolved, and while the storyline continues on, it keeps plodding as it has been for the past few volumes (though Watase does love her fight scenes, and the big climactic battle is a good deal of fun). It is, however, the epilogue that rises up to the standards set in most of the first thirteen volumes of the series-- Watase's great affection for the characters returns as she bids them goodbye for the final time, and it comes out in the quality of the work. It's worth getting through ""Part 2"" of FY for. ***"
5,It needs more stars than I can give it!,"We are brand new to Spelling Power and in just a couple of days can see a difference. Painless, fun, exciting, and focused on advancing my children at their own pace ... you can't beat it. Literally, the ONLY spelling resource I will buy for K-12 homeschooling. Using it with my 6 and 8 year olds both!"
5,Spelling Power Book,I love this program! If you are looking for an easy and thorough program to follow then look no further. This has everything you may need and is fun and easy for the kids. I won't go without it!
5,Give it 10 stars!,"My 7 year old groaned every time we mentioned spelling. She had low confidence in her spelling ability. The first day we started this program--WHAM-- what a difference! She saw that she could spell! She loves the 10 step study pages. Also, she likes that you only have to study the words she missed and not 10 to 20 words a day for a test at the end of the week. In this program, you take daily tests lasting just 5 minutes. Then the missed spelled words are repeated the next day.I'm looking now for the activity cards. This program is wonderful for homeschoolers and anyone wanting to improve their childs spelling ability.The author of the book recommends this for grades 3 to 12, but used it with her 5 year old granddaughter. We are using it with our 7 year old who is an advanced reader. Also this 10 step word study helps her with independent learning. She focuses better with steps.They have their own website if you want more info. Just type Spelling Power into your search engine."
3,3 1/2 stars?,I like the idea behind this book but the instruction you must read before starting is very thick and hard to read through.
3,Needs title change,"Although I always enjoy the Gaither Homecoming selections, this one is very misleading when it is titled as bluegrass. There are a few good bluegrass songs on it but there are also many of the entertainers and songs that are not bluegrass by any stretch of the imagination. Having said that, there is one song by Vince Gill on the album that makes the purchase worth while."
5,Shows Gaither's Excellence,"I have enjoyed watching this video, as have my friends a few times and like all Bill Gaither's videos it is excellent"
2,Not up to snuff,"What a huge disappointment. When I buy a Gaither Gospel Series video, I expect to see and hear plenty of the Homecoming Friends harmonizing with whatever guest personalities happen to be present. This one was way too short on homecoming friends! Watching/hearing George Jones work his way through old hymns isn't my idea of Country Bluegrass. Furthermore, this video was produced without Gloria Gaither, and she was SORELY MISSED! I was sadly disappointed in this video."
2,Rocky Road,"The box was smashed up, didn't look new as advertised.It didn't taste like the one my mother used to buy for me and my sister when we were kids."
5,better than Fanny May,"enjoyed these when I was a kid and still like them...it is a good combination of chocolate, marshmellow and pecans."
3,expected more.....,It did not impress me either with the technical contents or with the presentation style.
1,EMC Engineer's Review,"This is the most useless book on the topic of EMC that I have ever read. This book merely informs the reader of the various analytical techniques and informs the reader of what techniques to use to solve various EMC problems. A great portion of the book is spent on convincing the reader on the benefits of the various computational techniques. However, the book does not show how to implement the techniques. It preaches to the quire, since only engineers that are already in the field would buy the book. It does not provide a single worked out example or even provide the theory on how to implement the computational techniques. I would highly discourage anyone from buying this book."
3,just ok,I was disapointed b/c in all the stores the sander comes with a case.. I had to order the case in addition to the sander which after shipping made it about 25.00 more than the local store.. just not happy
5,very good book......i recommend it for all to read!,"I first saw the movie, A House Divided and searched out and found out that there was a book. I read the book and i recommend this book for everyone to read. It is a good book. If you haven't seen the movie. SEE IT! the author that wrote this book should be commended. He did a very good job. I am about to write a paper for my history class on this book. Linda D. Westman Mannsville, Oklahoma"
4,Well-written and Informative,"I recommend this book to readers who are American historians (novice or otherwise), those wanting to know more about American life and race relations, and to those who are interested in Black Women's Studies. I love studying American history generally, and particularly as it concerns African American females. Amanda's mother's story was as interesting to me in some ways as Amanda's story; there are two life histories being told here. This book shed light on the lengths that interracial families went to protect their loved ones under a system of aparthteid in early America. It tells a different story of America. One filled with more promise."
5,Five stars for her,Hi my name is Ashlee Dickson and I am a descendent of Amanda America Dickson. I am very apprieciative to the people who have read the book and reviewed the website. I am also proud of my heritage and what she has done for the people of America. I am proud to be a Dickson.I am John R. Dickson's daughter's child. Thank you for your time.
1,Should be classified as romance drivel,This book is a low level romance story written with every cliche. I read about half of it as I found it supremely boring and not what I had expected. I was stuck on an eleven hour flight and it was my last book available on my Kindle. A great disapointement.
4,Spach Channel 5 - All Funked Up,"One of the grooviest games of all time gets one of the greatest remix albums ever. As if the alien grooves that got Ulala dancing weren't enough already, this album features some funky remixes of the classic original tunes. Awesome basslines underpin both subtle and extreme remixes of the Space Channel 5 theme: Mexican Flier, pushing the Ken Woodman track from its roots with The Picadilly Brass into a full on dance/techno extravaganza! Far superior to its American cousin: the American Flier single, this album is opulent and brilliantly remixed featuring some big name guests like Kenji Eno, the head of Warp and creator of D2. I cannot recommend this CD more, to both videogame fanatics and lovers of electronic music, but stopped short of giving it 5 stars due to the limited number of tracks. Buy it, grab your lightsticks and rave all night long with Ulala, you won't be disappointed."
3,Should have bought the CD,I bought this after reading about it in Guitar Player. It's well shot for the time and shows just how talented these guys really are. I just wish I'd bought the CD as there's really nothing much to watch but it would have been nice to listen to it in my truck.You'd have to be really into watching four guys stand there and really not do much more than do head nods to communicate to get into the video. Buy the CD.
4,Bill Bruford - Rock Goes To College: Live 1979 DVD,"I have been following Bruford for quite a long time and finally got a chance to see him live! Great DVD showing the ""One of a Kind"" years....didn't think they could produce that style of music live but they did! A very well rounded drummer that surrounds himself with awsome musicians. He has also put out another DVD that highlights his more ""jazzy"" side....it too is worth seeing. Thanks Bill!"
2,"If you need the software quickly, order directly from MS","What a disappointment! Nowhere on their web site did Amazon mention that I wouldn't actually be receiving the MSDN CDs. In fact, in the ""Media Type"" field it says CD-ROM. What you really receive is just a subscription form to fill out to ORDER the CDs from Microsoft. Now I have to wait another 7-10 days to receive my software, which of course I needed yesterday. I should have ordered directly from Microsoft and saved some time!"
5,AMAZING!!,"""Best Looking Boys"" is perhaps one of their most genius songs. Once again the Promise Ring have proven themselves to be the Kings of emo/pop! The 3 tracks on this CD are extremely fun. These are 3 songs that I play over and over again and never grow tired of."
4,almost emo heaven,tell everyone we're dead os one of the promise ring's best songs.however best looking boys and especially american girl are not.still buy it anyway
3,Your chance to say you have tasted real chocolate,Well... this is considered one of those health foods that are a bit unpalatable to most I would bet. The beans look like almonds and when you bite them they are a kind of semi-chewy rich dark chocolate the likes of which you have never tasked and will problably never taste again. They seem to give me some pep and do eat them one at a time now and then and keep that at my office desk. Shared them with the office though and many people went to spit them out...great gag. Still they can say they tasted real raw chocolate! Also... if you are a chocoholic like me this is the fix that lasts... you take a few and you won't want anyone to even say chocolate for at least a week.
3,PSU,"I found that this case has optimal space, plenty of fans, and a awesome looking aura, but I had a problem with the power supply unit being faulty so that every so often my computer would freeze and loud static would emit from my speakers. I don't know if I was just unlucky, but I was a little angry at the case for not having a perfect power supply. I would recommend buying a corsair power supply to replace the one inside, but it might just be me. Overall it's a kewl case and a little load, but overall good."
1,A Very Lame Ghost Story!!!!!,I read some positive reviews of this game and decided to try it and to my surprise this game was horrible.I will start with the Super Nintendo like graphics this game offers.I noticed instantly and so will anyone whos ever played a resident evil or silent hill will not be impressed with anything this game has to offer. You never Kill ANYTHING and the game uses a variety of annoying features. For instance you have to use cameras in the monitor rooms to search through areas and try to find these little hidden cutscenes.The Storyline is weak as well. They turn the game into a love story almost instantly and it just never really picks up. You spend most of your time just running back and fourth or running away from ghost.To sum it up this game was horrible.
3,well....we'll have to see,"well, herez wut this games gonna be about2044....Moon Colony....A horrific crash on your honeymoon has left you separated from your fiancée. Opening the door to the lunar colony 239,000 miles from Earth....you find a desolate base haunted by the spectral remains of those who called it home. Prepare to embark on a paranormal journey to the Beyond.this game looks okit kinda looks like a bad storyill have to get the demo first"
2,below average loads,"a lot of missfires, these loads must be hit hard to go off, in older/weaker tools there will be a lot of missfires. noticibly weaker than brown ""hilti"""
4,Replaced an old one,I had one of these before and this replaces it. It works fine for small general sanding. I use a belt sander for larger jobs.
5,"Item exactly as described, fast shipping!",I have been wanting a new sander since my old Black and decker is out of commission... This one fits the bill!!
1,Useless,"In less than one week of purchase, I spent more on replacement parts to keep it working than I spent on the sander. This manufacturer appears to make much or most of the profit on repair parts and not on the product sale (though it does cost more than equivalent sanders by other manufacturers). This is the kind of American manufactured product that causes consumers looking for quality and dependability to switch for foreign manufactured products."
3,disapointing,"This unit is ligth and is comfortable in my hand.It is relatively quiet.The dust collection is relatively inefficient. Unless I got a model that was not balanced properly, the vibration are out of control for a sander of this size. Not surpisingly, the scratch pattern is not good."
3,It can turn ON by ITSELF!,"This is a nice little sander, except that on two separate occasions when I left it plugged in overnight, the sander somehow started up by itself. The eerie thing was that I locked the worksite, and when I returned, it was on, for perhaps hours. This happened TWICE. The last time, I left it on a notebook, and I'm thankful that it didn't start a fire (the paper was singed, with a hole sanded through about 10 pages). The sander itself was a little warm, but not hot and otherwise okay.It's a little loud (my dewalt belt sander is quieter) but after about five years of light use, it's still good as new. It has sealed ball-bearing technology and its dust collection is okay.If you get this sander, be sure to unplug it when you leave it."
1,WARNING,"Buyer Beware - This book does not include the CD-ROM that is required to complete the lessons. You will get to the second chapter and hit a brick wall. Every lesson from there on requires you to open a Pro/E tutorial file. Don't waste your money like I did.I also bought and highly recommend Pro/Engineer 2001 by David S. Kelley, ... It includes the CD-ROM and each tutorial file is available in either the student or professional version. This is very important if you are using a student license of Pro/E as it will not open regular Pro/E files."
2,Confusing game!,"My son got this game for his 3rd birthday. After playing it a few times, I wish we'd exchanged it for something else instead. It's not very entertaining, and it's downright confusing sometimes.My biggest beef with it is that on almost every turn, if the spinner lands on the ""moon"" space, you lose your turn. BUT, if your caterpillar is on the moon spot on the board, you have to spin the moon space on the spinner to move on. My son's pretty good with playing games, but this sudden change of rules confuses him every time.The game pieces are rather flimsy, and are starting to fall apart after just a few times playing. The game really isn't that exciting or fun, and I'm not even sure there's that much education value to it. It's cute, but there are much better games for this age group."
1,eric carle very hungry caterpillar game,"When I saw the eric carle games, I thought they looked great and bought 3 for my daughter. I gave her the hungry caterpillar game first. The instructions were confusing. You have to stop at all the special areas on the board in order to collect food pieces, but when you spin to move around the board, it seems you never move the number you spin because you have to keep stopping to get your game pieces. It's confusing, and this game just wasn't much fun. I've offerred to play other times, with my four year old, but she has never wanted to play it again. I returned the other eric carle games just in case they were as bad as this one. DO NOT BUY."
2,Disappointing Game,"After reading the info on the back of the box, I was really excited to play this game with my 3.5 year old. I was disappointed. It was boring! The player pieces are made of cardboard that you have to fold together. Not the most durable. Also, they are pretty large in comparison the the spots on the board so the board gets very crowded. I also didn't think the instructions were very clear. I would pass on this game!"
1,Don't buy it!,"My 3 year old daughter got this game as a gift. It's absolutely terrible! The only reason I'm taking the time to write the same things others have said is to bring down the star value! You never get to move the number of spaces you spin. ""Oh, look, you spun a 4. Move 1 and be forced to stop."" The cardboard boxes aren't going to last long at all. It's confusing and doesn't have any educational value whatsoever!"
1,Rubbish,"The game is rubbish - I feel completely ripped off.The instructions are unclear - if you play that you have to stop at the relevant spaces (I assume this is the right way as the other way doesn't make sense), it really confuses children because they throw a 4 say but can only move 1. If you play the other way, it's pointless because the stopping spaces are the same as every other space.The Very Hungry Caterpillar - GameWhoever came up with it should be ashamed of themselves. It's unimaginative, uninspiring, boring and stupid."
2,donating to Goodwill,"I put this game in the closet a few months ago and picked it up as I was cleaning. I have thought this game was boring and poorly developed since we first played it. I wondered if I was giving the game a fair chance, so I checked the reviews on Amazon. I concur with the unfavorable reviews and this validates my decision to put it in the Goodwill pile. I do not feel it is very educational and it is very boring. We love the game Orchard, spend your money on a really good game."
1,Maybe only for a 3 year old.,"My son just got this for his 4th birthday. For what this game costs you should definitely get more for the money. Besides that, he was bored to tears as he already knows how to count. I would definitely not buy this game for anyone, ever."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring...","This game is very boring, and the first time we played we never were able to land on one of the few spots they had to be able to collect food, which didn't make my daughter very happy. What is the fun in that? It needs a lot more spots that you can actually collect the food pieces when you land on them. Lame."
1,Not very entertaining,"I love all kinds of games, and I love the Eric Carle books, but this game is just not very fun. My four year old girl agrees. It's just boring, and the game piece thing you have to assemble out of cardboard is cheesy and the wrong size. There's not a lot of counting or educational value. Much better to read the book and play a different game like hi ho cherry o, or chutes and ladders, or candyland."
4,Seeing Jesus with Skin On,"Cheri Fuller is one of those people who stands on top of the sand dunes and celebrates what Lewis calls the ""holiday at the sea"" with God. Her book, A Fresh Vision of Jesus: Timeless Ways to Experience Christ, shows how God grows our vision for him by telling stories of how we see Jesus through the Word, through service, through trials, through mountaintop experiences and through his whispers to our hearts. In each section of the book she shares a story from her own life as well as a story from the life of a modern believer, a historical figure like Hannah Whitall Smith, and a biblical character like Mary Magdalene. Cheri's confident vision of Jesus enlarges my own and lifts my prayers in expectancy to see what he will do."
2,"too heavy, too straight","I bought it from Lowes. The blade is good, it's heavy duty...well it's heavy!! You get tired and sore after 10 swings. The handle is too fat. In he photo, it looks like it has the grip, but mine is simply straight. I wish they make the grip like a baseball bat and the whole handle curved which would be much easier to swing. I will change the handle and use it. Not recommended unless you have big upper body muscle or thinking to get the muscle."
1,There are much better options,"The Good: heavy, solid bladeThe Bad: thick handle, difficult to grip; rivets holding the blade on are too small and break off within a short amount of use; the ""supports"" holding the blade to the handle eventually twist and the blade becomes mis-aligned.Bottom Line: This is a poorly designed, poorly made tool. Don't buy it."
2,Could be so much better!,"This thing is so heavy, and like previous reviewers I can only swing it for a few minutes. The handle is much too thick to grip properly, and it feels too short (I'm 5'5""). Which leads me to wonder, am I using this thing right? I've tried swinging it with two hands like a forceful golf putter, I've tried swinging it from high overhead in a big arc, and when all else fails I just slam it into the ground and the blade does chop the roots somewhat. If I was golfing there'd be divots everywhere!! I like the idea of the manual tool, but I'm going to keep searching for a better weeder."
5,boystown gang,"i could not believe the songs, all had the long extended versions i have on 12"" singles this to me is the best cd i've ever purchased"
2,Pleased or not pleased with the item ordered,"I knew what I was ordering. It was not like ordering a book I had never read. I was disappointed in that, although I ordered a not new book, I didn't expect it to have anotations and underscoring. Other than that the book served my purpose and I was pleased to get it. Everyone would benefit from reading the life story of Helen Keller."
3,Helen Keller,I didn't really like Helen Keller. My favorite part is when Helen got her diploma because she was the first blind and deaf to graduate. I don't know how you can chan it was her life.I read it because it was a asiment.
4,Add some happiness to your day,This is a great book to read with your kids. It has good stories with a moral and lesson for all ages. Each story is a quick read that adds a nice break from the stress of the day!
4,I Disagree,"My Superclean works great, and NO you don't have to reach inside it to attach the handle. The handle is curved and you squeeze the part that hangs outside of the fryer to attach it. As for the steam, just wait a couple of seconds, it goes away. Just seemed like common sense stuff to me, but there you have it."
3,"First, determine what GB capacity you need to read!","I was happy to order this item b/c it gave me options: stand-alone reader, or install in an empty case bay. And user reviews were very good, and the price was right. I ordered it.Unfortunately, it will not read a 2GB SD card, which is the reason I bought it in the first place. Turns out, almost nobody advertises the capacities of card readers.Now that it's much too late, I find the following information from the Startech site: The chipset for the 35FCREAD20BK can support up to 1G SD,MMC and MS card."
2,"I guess it really IS kinda a drag, eh?","I bought this record after hearing the classic radio version of ""Kind of a Drag"" that everyone else has also mentioned in their reviews here. I came across it pretty cheap and figured maybe the record would have a few songs on it that warranted my purchasing it.Unfortunately that wasn't the case.Nearly all of the tracks on this record lack the vital energy and ""punch"" that the song Kind of a Drag possessed. Not only that, most of them felt more like ""filler"" then anything else. It is fairly obvious to this reviewer that the band used their initial record to get their feet wet.Go check out their album Time and Charges/Portraits as it is easily 100x better then this, their initial one."
3,A Different (sounding) Kind Of A Drag,"Why does Kind Of A Drag sounded different from the one that's being played on oldies radio? Although I've already bought two album of The Buckinghams, I'd rather listen to the radio than the CDs."
4,Mesmerizing Rhythm Well Worth It,"This is an unusual album for this underappreciated artist. The title track, Konya, is one of the most mesmerizing and rhythmic pieces I have ever heard. The other tracks are also worthwhile, but Konya is particularly impressive. Well worth it!"
4,Electrolux bags are as good as OEM,The vacuum bags I received were of good quality with significant savings obtained via ebay. Thank you very much!
4,"GREAT PERFORMANCES, GOOD SOUND.","The performances on this cd are excellent. All of the singers are wonderful, and Dmitri Mitropoulous is superb! He conducts as a man driven, obsessed with the magnificent and powerful score of this Richard Strauss masterpiece. The sound is good for a live performance from the 1950's. The met opera cd guide gives this performance a bad review. I totally disagree. This historic performance deserves to be preserved and listened to- it is powerful, well sung, and magnificently conducted."
2,Mitropoulus and Modl save this from disaster,"Anny Konetzni is excruciatingly and pathetically past whatever her prime may have been, Daniza Illitsch's fluttery excuse for a vibrato is annoying. Modl is absolutely spectacular, and Hans Braun is good as Orest. The conducting is taut. The sound is acceptable once you realize its age."
1,worthless,"very disappointed with Ames True Temper. They must not check what they make.After they made the piece and sharpened it, then they go and powder coat it, over the sharpened blade, worthless. Cant even sharpen it because of the serrations."
2,too blunt to cut,"The edge is so blunt that tool would pull the grass out with the roots, rather than cut it. I found that sharpening serrated edge without specialized tools is quite a chore, I wish manufacturer would charge more, but sell the tool pre-sharpened."
2,Not very effective,"I didn't have high hopes for this product and I wasn't disappointed. It works on small areas of regular lawn grass but nothing more significant than that. I was hoping to clear a marshy area that was overgrown with wild grass; while the grass wasn't very thick, this clearly wasn't the tool for the job. It might be useful for an urban homeowner with a very small lawn."
2,Grass whip good for practically nothing!,"Unless you're using this grass whip for dandelions, I'd buy something else. The shaft between the blade and the handle is way too small for cutting weeds and tall grass. After just a few swings it bent! I straightened it out a couple of times than gave up. Sorry I wouldn't recommend this product.."
3,Did the job...,Not your everyday tool to be swatting around but gets the job going.....needs a bit of elbow grease to get going!!
1,A total waste of money,Ames True Temper 1942600 Serrated Grass WhipIt does not work at all and I see it is not returnable now. I will take it somewhere to see if it can be sharpened. A complete waste of money.
2,more like a toy,"This was much smaller than I expected! I guess this is my fault for not paying enough attention to the measurements. It has both a very short handle and blade. Not at all sharp. I couldn't get it to cut much of anything. I should have returned it as I found it useless, guess it will be a wall ornament in my garage."
2,A flyweight contender,"I ordered the grass whip along with the brush cutter WE-40 hoping to find something similar to a tool I used 50 years ago. Neither proved suitable for cutting tall grasses on my property. The grass whip is tiny, light and without the mass to carry through the cutting stroke, which was stopped or deflected by even modest tufts of grass. I DID sharpen the tool using both a file and stone - and should add that paint tended to clog the grooves of the file in the process. Actually I don't see why the company shouldn't supply the tool sharpened in the first place.The only thing I found to cut easily were some succulent low growing weeds, with soft stems."
4,Not disappointed,"I just recieved my flip up shield with my 40 series helmet from Jafrum- it took a few minutes to figure out how to fit properly on the helmet, but it feels secure. I bought the shield before reading the bad reviews and was a bit trepidous about how it would fare in windy conditions; so on my test ride today I took my other helmet along just in case. So far the shield works well and I haven't experienced any problems with flipping so far. (You have to make sure the piece at the top fits in the hole). As for wearing the shield at night there's a note on it that warns against night wear. You'd be well advised to get the clear option for that. It gets a little windy on the face at high speeds but that's the nature of the design and it's not intolerable. This is a well priced shield that once properly secured works fine for me. I was also pleased with Jafrum's service-I've ordered from them before and am always pleased with the speedy delivery even with standard shipping"
3,Very Dark If Tinted,"I bought the tinted version, and it is so dark that you shouldn't consider using it unless you can GUARANTEE that you won't be out riding at night. Even at dusk or on overcast days, it's a bit dark.But it's cheap and fit the bill for what I wanted."
3,flip shield,It works alright but its a little cheap and the wind makes it loud inside when riding with down
2,Not quite so universal,"The visor itself seems reasonably well made, and optically seems very clear, with a firm notch that catches the visor into its lowest position. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually fit my new 3/4 helmet (BBH) very well. It portrudes from the front of the helmet such that it seems very awkward; the snaps don't quite line up, and since they are not adjustable, that's a problem; and it's angled upward so as to catch the breeze, due to the not quite precise fitment. At the low price, I rolled the dice, and it didn't work-- I'll hold onto it, and hope another helmet I pick up in the next year or two will fit it... or that a friend can use it.On the extremely positive side, Jafrum delivered the product very quickly (ordered on a Wednesday with expedited 1-3 day shipping, and arrived Friday morning.) Great service, once again.Side note... can't help but wonder if they sent me the wrong one, as the advertised product is supposed to have adjustable snaps... the one I received, did not."
2,Not as good as the helmet it goes with,"The face shield fits the helmet well, and it is of good quality. But the sliding buckles on the shield allow it to flop around in the wind at highway speeds. I wouldn't use this for anything but driving slowly on local roads"
1,Not-so-flippy,"These were not what we expected. They had far more wind noise than normal flippy shields, and they shook when the wind hit them just right on the freeway. They also didn't actually flip up without almost breaking them (or my arm). Actually, I ordered 2 and only managed to get 1 to actually flip, but only when it was off the helmet.We bought them for a 550-mile trip to a bike rally, and luckily, we found different ones there.It is well worth your money and your time to spend a little more and find some at a local store."
2,Flip Shield,"Very clear, very clean. Light weight, but feels cheaply made. Will not stay in up position without help."
4,good shock for 55-57 chevy using rear stud style shock mount,I bought these shocks for use with my rear stud style shock cross member. This is shorter than a stock 55-57 shock. Fit was great worked well but I needed a stiffer shock so I bought the Full gas KYB version instead.
3,Good summertime book,"This is a cute book about Kipper's solution to a hole in his wading pool. It is short and easy to read. Would be a good book to take along in the car. The illustrations are simple and bright. My daughter likes it, but there's not enough to it to make it a favorite."
2,Politically Biased,"While this book purports to be an unbiased account of the foster care system and its impact on African-American children, it fails miserably. The author is biased against the system from the very beginning, and presents only stories that back her view of the system. There are definitely issues with the foster care system including: overworked case managers, lack of funds, inability to assist children in an appropriate fashion 100% of the time. Certainly there is a racial issue since the majority of children in foster care and up for adoption are minorities, but is this because of the foster care system itself or are we missing a major piece in the puzzle? It is this missing piece that is missing from Ms. Roberts' book."
2,OK animation bad storyline,"I bought the first and second dvd of this series when I saw the trailerI thought it would be a pretty good fighting not so serious anime but having just finishing watching the second disk I was very disappointedto much serious sexual situations,near hentai actions or nudity.I knowsome anime shows that have some of this in their shows Black Lagoon for example but those shows at least don't do this every five minutes So if your looking for a good serious fight anime I would not recommend this anime"
2,"Mildly amusing, but","silly rambling plot is no grabber. Stock action plot material along with one of the worst theme songs to date, this series is definitely a 'renter'"
1,One of the Worst Books about Islam,"This book is Filled with obvious lies about Islam, the true pure fundamentals of Islam are very twisted in this book with a clear purpose of deviating people. If you want to learn about Muslims go to a Muslim, not a hate filled Christian like Daniel Pipe."
1,Bad Purchase,"If this fryer could only walk and talk you would have a walking, talking piece of (...). The detachable handle on the metal fryer basket is a joke, almost impossible to use. A third degree burn waiting to happen. The ready light quit working a month after purchase. Stay away from this fryer."
5,A True Classic,"I was so impressed with john Arthur Martinez on Nashville Star, I ordered his CD the moment it came out and was MORE impressed with him after listening to it! There is not a weak cut to be found. Unlike most ""country"" music these days, his voice has not been over-processed to the point of being unrecognizable and the honesty and sincerity just shine forth. John Arthur Martinez, your music flows from your heart straight to the hearts of your listeners. Lone Starry Night is a true joy, a true classic. I just flat love it!"
5,jAming fantastic,"You may have seen him on Nashville Star but you won't really appreciate the music until you hear this new album. John Arthur Martinez has put together an eclectic collection of songs that has something for almost everyone. Whether you want a ballad, traditional country, or a rocking good time, Lone Starry Night is for you. I highly recommend it.David Thompson"
2,Mediocracy at its best,"This album is just okay. I wouldn't spend money on it. The spanish influence is cool, but his voice is not great. The armadillo song is good, but his rendition of Amarillo by Morning is less than par. He is not one of the top artists to come out of Texas. If you are looking for a real artist, try Pat Green, Cory Morrow, Charlie Robison, or even the Los Lonely Boys. Wait till there is a clearance sale at Target to pick up this album."
5,Absolute Must Have CD!,"This is an incredible CD! Arguably the best country CD I have heard in over a year. (And even if you aren't a fan of country music, buy this!) If you were a jAm fan already, you will not be disappointed. If you are new to jAm, be ready for an album that just beams with honesty, personality, uniqueness, traditional yet contemporary sounds. I wasn't very impressed by jAm on the first season of Nashville Star but was blown away by this album. 11 of the songs were written by jAm, too!"
4,For Radiohead Fans,it's a great interview cd. you learn a lot about your favourite artist. a must have for all you radiohead fans out there.
5,All That and Then Some,"I was excited to see the third book in this series on the shelves and snatched up a copy immediately. Blackfunk III, like its predecessors, is a compelling novel about crime, sex, and love. Presley has a contemporary voice that draws readers in from the first page and it is hard to put any of his books down. I would agree that the series should be read in order but even as a stand alone book, this one carries its own weight. I look forward to his next novel, one that is excerpted at the end of Whatever It Takes. Presley remains one of my all-time favorite authors."
3,"When hate and love clash, there is usually and explosion....","""Answers are for questions I'm looking for solace!""Here in our finale we're faced with those long awaited answers...Will Andria and Rashaun's love make it?Will his friend's views on marriage change his mind about his own looming nuptials?Will Andria be able to raise their child alone?Will Kim learn the difference between Blackfunk, and love?This trilogy that concludes Blackfunk is not nearly as electrifying as in parts I & II, however it does pick up more smaller stories from various characters. Such as love, relationships, color syndrome, friendships, forgiveness, as well as present day POLITICS (PEOPLE PLEASE VOTE!) and it shows the growth of the characters involved."
2,Please let this be the end!!!!!!,"I really think that it should've stopped after the first one. The first one was good, the second one o.k., tolerable. This one sucked, and i took me forever to read it. Please no more!!! I WAS BORED!!"
3,Truely Blackfunk,"This was another one of Michael Presley's must readers. I have read all 3 book and I enjoyed every single one. Now I can't wait to read Tears on a Sunday Afternoon, by him also. Go MP!"
4,"Excellent, but no turning fork","Finally had a chance to use this after sitting around fora few weeks, and it's just great!! It gets hot very quickly,and it's fairly easy to cleanup (seems easier to clean ifyou let the sauces dry -- they fall off the teflon surfacea lot easier than when they're still gooky).Caveat, though -- it doesn't come with the turning fork,even though it's advertised to come with one.Otherwise, very happy with the item, and will be used a lot,especially in the cold weather."
5,Absolutley GREAT!!,"This grill is STUPENDOUS! It heats up quickly, it is non-stick and VERY easy to clean. Just stick both the grilling surface and the tray underneath it in the dishwasher. The food tastes like a real Gas/Charcoal grill which never ceases to surprise me. Veggies, meats -- all good. There is another bonus through buying it through Amazon.com. The grill originally cost 99.99 and was bought for that price. Then the price dropped to 49.99 (I think within 30 days). How is that for customer service! Overall, I am as satisfied as I could possibly be with this purchase and with Amazon.com.This product is a definite winner!TY from Boston"
4,Wow!!!,"I got an HC7 a couple of weeks ago and am really impressed with the image quality. I originally tried the Sony HDR-SR1 but was put off by its dismal low-light performance. The HC7 is much better on that front. Color tends to wash out a bit, but noise is not overly prounounced. However, in bright outdoor lighting, the picture quality is absolutely stunning.In regards to photos taken by the HC7, I haven't printed any out yet, but I've viewed some on my 1080p and they look very good.Overall, I am a happy camper. Perhaps unfairly, I gave this a 4 star only because it lacks 3 CCDs."
5,We love it so far,We love our new HD camcorder so far. It's pretty easy to operate but here is a hint GO SLOW ON PANNING!!! If you go to fast it makes you dizzy on playback! Great picture but I couldn't get my Samsung HD DLP to recognize the playback straight from the camera using the digital component hookup. It did find on the plain ol analog connect. Wish I had HDMI connection on the tv.We have not tried to edit tape yet. That will be the next challenge.
1,Defective - Amazon couldn't replace,"Although i chose this camera after a comparison with Canon's and JVC's HD cameras, my item was defective ""the cassette compartment won't retract back automatically when closed"".Amazon said they will replace, then they sent an email today saying they can't because it seems a lot of cameras are affected. I'm not sure why do they allow people to buy it if there was a widespread problem.The 1 star rating is due to defect, not performance.Shadi"
4,Can't beat it,"Picture are nice (depends how steady your hand is). The video is beautiful, once again the steadier the better. Big improvement over my old JVC in every aspect. Low light is not very good, but then again what is. I am satisfied."
2,Does not last,"We bought several of the Dewalt 5-inch random orbit sanders less than a year ago and none are useable today. The problem is the foam backing to the sanding disk - all have dried out and cracked, most have lost large chunks of foam - and the cost of a replacement foam disk backing is 60% of the cost of a new sander.When they could be used, they worked well, but the first one began to crack and fail within 6 months, and the other four followed soon after.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
4,Wish it would last longer,"I've been into woodworking for the past 15 years. Over that time I've gone through 4 of these sanders. Each lasts about 4 years, but I use it alot. I've tried the Porter Cable and Makita sanders, but this one works best for me. Maybe it's because I'm used to it. As I said before, I do lots of sanding and the sander works really well until it dies. I attach my sander to a Fein vacuum, and almost all of the dust is sucked up into the vacuum. My fourth one just died, so I'll be ordering a new one. I originally had the variable speed sander, but never used the slower speeds, so I'll order this one and save some money."
2,mess and swirls,"I sand a lot. For about 12 years, and over 1000 pieces of furniture, I've gone through a lot of sanders. First I used a Makita which lasted forever and did well. When it finally gave up the ghost, I bought another but it wasn't up to snuff and I ended up with one of these DeWalts, given away with the purchase of another DeWalt tool. It was great - removed material, didn't leave swirls, easy on the hands. So I used several through the years, then the design changed and they ran a little rougher. The latest one is awful and I'm wondering if it is just a lemon or they all are this way. It leaves tiny swirls, and large waves over table tops. The dust collection is non-existent: my place is a permanent mess. The one good thing is the backer pad for the hook and loop has not worn out as quickly as some others.Is anyone else having the problems I'm having with it?"
4,Works great,"I bought the sander and it works just as I thought it would. I am not a professional woodworker, and don't know about the bearings etc, but it hooks up to my shopvac, and does different sanding than my belt sander is taking care of."
4,so far so good,Having only used it on two projects I'm not sure how much weight my review offers. It is a great tool so far and I couldn'tbe happier.That said many long time users have had several issues with this sander which I encourage you to read through toget a better over view.So far for me it has been great and I would recommend it for moderate lightweight use.
5,good business card holder,"20 pages double sided with 4 spaces for business cards. Decent looking, does the job. nice product. good to help organize the piles of cards I have."
5,Beautiful Business Card Holder,This leather Business card holder is beautiful. It looks like it cost five times more than it did. The shipping was fast and it arrived in perfect condition. I highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a card holder.
4,Genuine Leather Business Card Organizer Holder Burgundy,"Got this to help keep credit cards, store cards, etc organized. Wound up using for business cards instead. It would work for either purpose but it's too darn long/tall to tote around except in my briefcase. It's a little over 10 inches high by 4 inches wide. Much too long to fit in a pants pocket or anything but the largest of jacket pockets. I found another product by the same maker which is shorter (about 6x4) that I much prefer and am using for my credit cards -- and it was cheaper too!Leather Business Card Organizer Holder Wallet Available in 4 Colors"
3,Stinky,"This has a horrible stench of plastic. I've had two of them for 3 weeks. They still stink! Other than that, they hold business cards just fine."
5,Genuine Brown Leather Business Card Organizer,"I like the genuine leather; the nostalgic smell of the leather, the sturdy feel, and the old school way to collect and organize business cards. On my desk, it looks good among the wooden things I have, and when I have visitors that leave me a card, we usually end up having a conversation about the leather card holder. It will last a long time..., thanks!"
1,Consider other options....,"I was excited to get this product. I had MS Money 2000, and later upgraded to MS money 2002 standard. I run my own small business and needed something that was easy to use, and that would not require transfering information from one program to another. My first problem with MS Money 2002 deluxe and busines, is that YOU MUST UN-INSTALL the previous software! That was a pain. Why couldn't it just update the other version??The book is helpful, but is far to small, it leaves hanging on many areas.Setting up accounts in this program is not easy, it is not like Quick Books at all! The talking voices are annoying, and the help file never gives you what you want. I spent an hour figuring out how to update the business information, so that the invoices would have that vital information. I tried searching for address, no luck, and then business address, no luck. Eventually I stumbled upon how to fix it, but I doubt I could get there again easily.Please consider other options!"
1,Enormous waste of money,"I had been using the Money 95 version since its inception and found it very simple but useful for managing day-to-day finances. I decided to upgrade to 2002, and boy! what a mistake. The program is too cluttered with useless bells & whistles, and the budget features continually crash the program. I have been sent entirely new software from Microsoft addressing the problem, yet it continues. If you work within a budget and find the monthly reports vital (like I do), this program is astoundingly bad. In fact, I'll either switch to another program or dump this version and reinstall '95. What a waste of money."
1,Crash-o-rama,"Like most of the other reviews, this is an upgrade I wish I would have avoided. I upgraded from Money99 (which was rock solid) hoping to use the increased abilities of portfolio management. I have used Money since 95 and have been completely happy until this latest upgrade. I can almost guarantee that it will crash on me a minimum of twice each session. Unfortunately, I have waited too long in giving it ""the benefit of the doubt"" and am pretty much stuck with it. After this version, I am seriously considering Quicken or some other non-Microsoft money manager.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you are a glutton for punishment!!!"
2,Not friendly for invoicing,Be careful of this product if you want to produce custom invoicing. An Invoice Designer is included but crashes when saving any customization. Microsoft's web page says they are aware of the problem but do not have a solution. There is no provision for adding my own text (such as web page address) to the form. I also had a problem with a previous version where it could not print correctly to my HP printer.Microsoft should be shamefully embarrassed by these failures and not market to any business if it cannot produce essential functionality.
1,MS took a good thing and made it bad,"Money 2000 was great; it was fast, easy to use, and worked well. 2002 must have been written by a different group: several features don't work like they're supposed to, the online banking 'feature' is horrible now -- it integrates unapproved transactions with your register, forcing you to search through your register to find unapproved transactions. In addition, the budgeting feature breaks, and the really cool cash-flow feature doesn't work -- it will only display ""1999"" and a zero balance, and won't let you go in to specify different dates.It's too bad it's such a pain (...)to return software, or I would have done it."
1,Age of Silliness,"The basic premise of the book is contradicted by history. First, Gore was considered the ""hawk"" during the Clinton Administration. Secondly, we can not automatically suppose 9/11 would have happened had Gore been elected. The Clinton-Gore Administration had an ambitious plan to engage in Afghanistan prior to 2001 but held off because he wanted to leave the decision to the Bush Administration since Bush would have had to fight that war. Also Gore would have taken the warnings about 9/11 more seriously.Finally the book simply uses all the long disproven myths about the ""far-left"" to create some bizarre scenario. All-in-all a wasted effort designed to pander to rightwing. Sadly, 9/11 did not happen during a Democratic Presidency it happened during a Republican Presidency caused mainly by the negligence of that President."
1,Polemic disguised as Alternate History,"The main test of alternate history as a genre is that it be somewhat believable. I got two pages in and the character ""Al Gore"" was so far off the mark that I went back to the reviews here, and returned the book to get my money back. I then borrowed the copy of a friend who recommended it. I read Turtledove and other alternate history, I study real history as a hobby. I'm to the right of the current republicans (if you're going to occupy a country, start up the draft!) and consider myself a cranky libertarian. This one is just weak writing and political polemic. The weakness of modern American politics is the constant tendency to present your opponents as idiots rather than to argue rationally.

4,"Review of ""The Vendetta""","An excellent book. Purvis's son gives us his father's history with an unblinking eye,and manages to give the reader insight into Purvis the man:a pariah who is forced to leave the F.B.I. by a vindictive Hoover,yet who still manages to be a hero.Historically Alston Purvis is right on the mark and pulls no punches. I only wish that other authors would have been as responsible when writing about his famous father. This book is not hero-worship,but is stunning in it's grasp of history,and hard hitting in it's facts.This book should not be left off the shelf of anyone interested in the F.B.I.'s early days and the desperados Purvis and his men hunted down. It is really something new!"
3,FBI book,"Fairly good story. I bought it because my Uncle was mentioned in it,a fact I learned via web search (inside the book)."
3,Better Than Expected,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. ""The Vendetta"" reveals the vindictive jealousy harbored by J. Edgar Hoover toward the legendary G-man Melvin Purvis because the Director felt that Mr. Purvis was garnering too much favorable publicity for the success of the FBI's battle against crime during the Thirties. That alone is fascinating, since it brings to light the demons which haunted Mr. Hoover throughout his life. Of equal interest, I felt, was the authors' vivid description of the Midwestern crime wave itself, and the colorful outlaws who blasted their way into infamy. All in all, a very good read, much better than I had anticipated."
4,Pettiness and Jealousy,"At first sight, you can easily conclude that the author is biased because Melvin Purivs is his father. Despite this,Alston Purvis draws enough on documentary sources so that the story of J. Edgar Hoover's vendetta against Melvin Purvis is clearly laid out.At least two points remain controversial. One is Melvin Purvis's height. His son claims he was 5'9"", but a photogrpah in the book of Purvis with Hoover shows that Purvis was definitely shorter than the 5'9"" Hoover. Also, other sources list his height at 5'4"".The second point is whether Purvis's death by handgun was acciodental or suicide. His son states a case that it was accidental. However, he also admits that his father was depressed, and had previously undergone treatment for depression.Overall, this book was interesting reading."
3,Hoover revisited,"In this age, J. Edgar Hoover is taking quite a beating from those who would not have dared to cross him during his life. He certainly was a force of good generally, but egotistical and abusive. He did not reserve this exclusively for his enemies, this book details his treatment of Melvin Purvis. The context of 30's crimefighting is interesting, along with the workings of the FBI.Generally a good read."

4,"Good stuff, hard to find",I used to buy this at our local supermarket. They quit carrying the Ace brand and instead got some worthless cheap stuff. I couldn't find it anywhere in town so I bought 16 rolls from Amazon and am pleased with it. It does tend to let a cord or two fray off when removing from the roll but otherwise works well.
3,If used for the intended purpose of sports ...,"If used for the intended purpose of sports tape, I don't think it has the qualities for a true sport tape. It's not super sticky, which would be good if it's applied to sensitive skin. It doesn't stick to itself very well either. Applied to an ankle, it doesn't stand up to a rigorous game of soccer. The other problem is that it's very difficult to tear with bare hands. Scissors must be on hand, which is often not the case when using it on the field. Overall, it's a good tape for holding a gauze pad over a cut or lightly taping a wrist."
1,"Wrong title, wrong info",I must say that the song called 'arabian nights istanbul' deeply dissapointed me because istanbul is a Turkish city and there are no arabs except some tourists and no arab nights of course. please little attention!!
2,duro-rest water pillow,"pillow came promptly.pillow is too large. my wife, lying on her side, her head on pillow was not level.I took the water sack and stuffed it in a king size pillow case with an old smaller pillow and a large folded towel under the water water sack She finds this very comfortable.I'm surprised the pillow is so big. I think it's too big for me, an average male. For the low price I don't mind just using the water sack. I think a major redesign of this pillow is needed."
3,girls gone wild ultimate spring break,"It is what it is. I have come to the conclusion that pornography is a waste of time, the spirit and money."
5,Good for young kids,"This is one of my boy's favorite books. Until recently, this was THE one book he'd consistently bring to me to have read. The colors, simple drawings, and pace work well for toddlers."
5,Great for teaching color mixing,Mouse Paint is a great book for teaching color mixing to Primary Aged children. The children get caught up in the action of the mice which helps them to remember the color combinations. Fun!
5,Excellent,This book is so simple to read and teaches the basics of colors and mixing. Your little ones will enjoy it!
4,Book Helped To Find Hidden Treasure,"My husband and I recently purchased a house with hardwood floors that were covered with tile and carpet. We followed the easy, step by step,instuctions and were able to uncovered the beautiful oak flooring hidden by the old floor covering."
3,A must have for any DJ who needs old vinyl classics on CD!,"I must admit, all of Kano's music is not all that great. However any DJ will tell you that some of these classics are virtually impossible to find on compact disk. Two in particular from this disc are some of the most sought after dance classics of the early 80's ( I'm Ready) and (Holly Dolly) both of which are in their original full 12"" versions. For those DJ's on a budget, forget it; Pick This Up Now! Having these classics in your library in digital is well worth it!"
3,Good collection could be better,"Kano has always been one of those groups that I have found to be rather mysterious. Their sound was quite unique and their personal profiles are practically non-existent. I'm Ready is one of my all-time favourite songs and it is included on this collection. However, this collection could have done without a few of the tracks on there and included some songs from their New York Cake album. None of the songs from that album are on this cd.Here's hoping that Unidisc will finally release that album on cd, possibly with the single versions of the hits included as bonus tracks."
2,..ok..,It Is ok but not what i was expecting..it Is boring actually. wish it was more spooky. and its not that great
3,True Irish Ghost Stories,I like ghost stories especially those that are thought to be true. This book was interesting but not captivating and a book that held you in the story. I had to read it in pieces.
3,Free download,Downloaded this book free on Amazon Kindle. I have read a few pages then decided to stop reading. I wouldn't be able to sleep if I scared myself.
4,true irish ghost stories,this book has true stories from the irish culture interesting reading if you like real accounts of stories from the people who it happen to
1,Not what I thought it would be,"I thought this would be different - nothing much in it that kept my attention. Slow, boring read. Ended up not finishing it, probably won't."
5,great book,even though i haven't read the book - i like that it is free and i can pick it up and read whenever i am ready
5,True Ghost Stories is an oxymoron!,"I am Irish, and have read books, listened to music, watched movies and have even been to Ireland. I had to laugh when I saw the title of this book, because the Irish are known for their superstitions! I had to read this book! The price was right and I loved the book!"
2,Ghost Stories,"Book got tedious and rather boring. Did nor find anything unusual in the stories, same old tales of ghosts known worl wide."
3,not so scary but entertainig,my mother is irish born and she had told me some of the stories in this book to scare me as a child. it was a goodbook
2,True Irish Ghost Stories,I thought the story was okay for a free offer from Kindle. I have seen several shows that have ghost stories on them from Ireland that were more interesting!
3,Well Done,"I found the stories in this book, proven or unproven to be quite enjoyable. I hope to visit Ireland someday and visit these sites."
3,True Irish Ghost Stories.,Wonderful read. Couldn't put it down. Great horror stories though was sad the book as over when I turned to the lat page.
5,great,This is the first time that l have read a book on a phone it is really a good set up because when l go off somewhere l have it on my phone.
3,TRUE IRISH GHOST STORIES,"I was disappointed in this one. It was very wordy & seem to leave a lot of loose ends. Maybe it was because they were ""true"" stories."
3,Dcoumentary..,This is more of a simple documentation of various ghost stories and happenings. There is no suspense or excitement. This is not to say it is a bad book.. the tales are interesting enough.
4,fun,"Have not had time to read this yet, but it should be fun reading to my grandsons. Good campfire reading."
2,kinda boring,"should come off like the FoxFire books but maybe ya gotta be irish to fully appreciate this, found it to be a bit boring."
3,True Irish Ghost Stories,"True Irish Ghost Stories Lots of stories, however insignificant it may be, the names are anonymous to protect the past I suppose."
2,True Irish Ghost Stories,I really DId not like the book. The way it is written you do not know we're one story begins and the other ends.
4,Very interesting,I found these stories to be very interesting and chilling. They definitely had me have the spine chilling effect while reading
4,Lonely Planet Argentina,This product was as represented and arrived in a timely manner.Original advertsiement should have included edition number.
1,COMPLETELY USELESS,"If you are a student, make less than $25K a year, and enjoy staying in rudown versions of Motel 6, then this book might be for you.First, Argentina is no longer the bargain the authors claim it is. Outside of BA, you can get a decent meal on the cheap, but other than that, expect to pay $90 and up for a decent hotel. Many of the references in the book come from online entries and clearly have not been checked for quality, cleanliness, etc.Second, per the review(s) below, many of the recommended restaurants have closed - in BA, you are better off going to Puerto Madero and picking a reataurant at random - they are all good.Third, keep in mind that AR got hammered by the peso devaluation and many cities are still recovering. Cordoba and others can be less than an idyllic vacation spot.Conclusion - if you are seeking a quality vacation, you are better off using a good travel agancy. You get what you pay for in AR, notwithstanding the claims of the authors."
2,"O.K. for Argentina, nothing on Uruguay","If you're looking for information on Uruguay, I recommend you pass on buying this book. That's the information I was looking for and it's not in this book. There's extensive (and sometimes interesting) information on Argentina but only superficial coverage of just two cities in Uruguay. To include Uruguay as part of the subtitle really misleads potential purchasers. For Uruguay there's much more, and much better information available through any web search engine."
3,Light-hearted anecdotes from a roadie,This book is a very lightweight look at the great band Black Sabbath - it doesn't have a lot of detail but it certainly has some charm. Fans of the band will enjoy the recollections of the authors that were there to witness these behind-the-scene stories. Anyone looking for an in-depth biography should look elsewhere.
3,Real Review,"...Now, i ordered this product in hopes of it being and having: A. Comfortable B. Good Sound Quality C. DurablityNow these headphones are VERY small, dont be fooled by the picture. They do however fit well if you wear them right. They are worn behind the head at an angle.As far as the sound quality goes, i would give it a 2/5. The Bass on it [is] just plain [bad]. The fading (noise from phone to phone) is pretty good.And finally, i can't really tell u much about the durability of this product as i haven't owned it long enough, but it looks like it will last a long time."
1,A Strong argument AGAINST Vanity publishing,"This is one of the most awful books I have ever read. The use of language and grammatical structure is at a seventh grade level - IF...Phrases like,""R... there is a big difference working for J... compared to H..."" A... said...The author uses He said, He said, He said until you want to scream!The story line goes almost no where. At least to page 121 where I stopped and wonder who is going to give me back the hours lost in wasting my time with this clap-trap?I am going to actually throw the book away. I never throw books away. Even when I do not like them, I always assume that someone out there may like it. But this piece of garbage I think should be burned.Vanity publishing look out! There is a reason editors send rejection letters."
5,Pull Me Under,"I found the song ""Pull Me Under"" in the free upload section. I'm looking forward to hearing the other two songs on the EP.This is an Alternative band, dark lyrical style."
2,Finland for Finlanders,"This book was more expensive than similar books for other European countries. Sometimes it seemed as though it had been written for other Finlanders, instead of for tourists or researchers. I was not impressed, although the photos are color and a few are actually intriguing."
4,Good Replacement!!,"This thermostat works great, holds heat within ! or 1.5 degrees. Works with baseboard or fan forced wall heaters. Good instruction sheet. Only negitive is when you try to calibrate it the plastic you have to twist is way too tight. I gave up afraid I would break it. I have two of these and will buy more as I upgrade my heaters."
5,Pudding review,"The product arrived extremely quickly, only to find out wrong product was shipped. The seller, quickly shipped correct product and provided a return shipping label for the wrong product. They were responsive and quick. Next time quick check to ensure sending vanilla pudding and not vanilla tapioca would help."
5,Elliot Thomas Proto One....,"this is great! just purchased today and having so much fun with my tournament set with Proto One. Lots of my friends have B-DAMAN as well, and thats how I got started. Even mum and dad is playing!!!"
5,b-DABLAST!!!!!!,EVAN THOGH PROTO1 MAY NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH BUT ITS 1 OF 2 B-DAMAN THAT HAVE ACURACY AND RAPIDFIRE ITS GRATE FUN:)BUY IT
2,Not comfortable at all,"I've been wearing compression stockings for a long time now and these are the most uncomfortable and cumbersome pair I've ever come across. The stocking is not made of the normal nylon stocking material, it is a much heavier and thicker weave. It's a bit like having a big, bright wool sock pulled up to your knee. You could definitely not hide this stocking or pass it off like a standard nylon. And since the weave is so thick there wasn't much stretch at all to the fabric. I was so unhappy I've thrown away the one stocking I wore once, and returned the unused one for a refund."
4,Bonne affaire,"Un maximum de plaisir pour un prix minimum, pour celui qui n'est pas faché avec la langue de shakespeare..."
4,Visit with an old friend,"I enjoyed these set for the memories it brought. I remember watching these shows as a kid. The early episodes were much more entertaining than the later ones which became merely trashy camp sci-fi. These episodes blend some sci-fi elements with some ""Mission Impossible"" overtones."
5,Excellent First Season... So Far,"Most of my experience with Voyage consists of the color episodes shown in syndication. As I child, I dug the whole ""monster of the week"" thing, BUT, as an adult watching the same color episodes on the SciFi channel, I couldn't get over how cheesy they were.That said, I ordered Season 1, Vol 1 of Voyage after reading reviews of the stellar B/W eps. Nice to see that this first half of the inaugural season lives up to the hype.There is something about B/W that adds to the suspense of tv shows or movies. Voyage (as well as season 1 of Lost in Space)makes excellent use of the lack of color, resulting in taut and suspenseful installments. I especially enjoyed ""The Fear Makers,"" ""The Ghost of Moby Dick,"" and ""Submarine Sunk Here.""Great video and audio transfers. The extras are nice too. Highly Recommended.Looking forward to Vol. 2."
4,Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea DVD,"Was a little hesitant in buying this given a review about authoring problems with it. After playing it, there are a few places when the pix freezes for a bit, then then keeps going. Not enough to worry about in my case as it works at least 99.9% just fine. It shouldn't be a problem for most, but...your mileage may vary. IMO, pay be credit card so you have some recourse if you have problems."
4,first season,"A good program from my childhood. I was surprised that it was in black and white, but it was OK anyway."
4,VTTBOTS set#1,"i'll just comment on the DVD quality its great! better then Fox's Lost in Space that has the annoying video interlace lines i do't see them here and unlike the lost in space DVDs Voyage has the ORG 1964 Fox logo tags at the end, i just wish Fox left the ""brought to you by"" tag on the end of the Beginning theme on each ep insted of muting it, but ya can't have everything."
4,Show Is Good - Discs May Be Bad,Be careful with disc 2. Amazon apparently received an entire shipment of sets having defective 2nd discs. Both my original and replacement sets had defective 2nd discs.
3,Very good quality and extras on first set,"I've seen the check discs for these and the image quality for both B&W and color (the unaired pilot and Irwin Allen's ABC promotional presentation) is excellent. Extras include about 20 minutes of behind the scenes footage on the pilot (without audio), promotional artwork and PR photos and photos of merchandise from the series. Can't wait for the color episodes--not as serious as season one but more fun to watch to me."
4,Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea Season 1 Vol 1,Good set as Season 1 was never shown on tv where I live. Good DVD quality. A must for fans !
4,Omron BP Monitor,This is a good and reliable blood pressure monitor at a very reasonable price. I would certainly purchase it again.
3,ptm,"I love everything about this camcorder except the motor noise on playback is high-pitched, very noticable, and unavoidable according to the Canon support rep. He told me I needed to go w/ an Optura 30, 40, 400 or 500 to avoid motor noise. Very sad to have to return this because everything else is great."
1,can not load cassette,"Like the other reviewers, I used to be a big canon fan. I owns various canon products. But this Elura 65 dissapointed me. It just refused to load cassette after 8 month of ownership. There was a minor problem before this, the zoom lever will be automatically adjusted to the maximum zoom from time to time. I will have to pull things back to the normal size manually. Now with the tape not loadable, it is useless. I wasn't able to tape some important event such as a groundhog day celebration in Punxutawney,PA, and now, foreseably a big superbowl weekend in Pittsburgh. This loss is non-recoverable!"
2,Elura 65 not dependable,"I purchased my Elura 65 new, before there were many reviews and like many others have had repeat problems with the ""remove the cassette"" message. I've had to mail it back to Canon twice and they replaced the drum assembly each time. Now it's died again, with a video tape inside, and Canon wants another $145.00 to get it out. Why would I pour good money after bad? I'll have to write off the tape and just purchase a new a camera, but definitely not a Canon.When it worked, the camera worked great out of doors (as long as I didn't get the moisture error) and ok indoors."
2,Great features--poor shelf life!,"I bought the Elura 65 to transition from the out-dated Compact VHS fomat to MiniDV. The Canon has great features and performance for the price. I began to experience difficulties with random freezing of the camera after only 5 weeks of use. I foolishly believed Canon support who repeatedly insisted I merely needed to accomplish periodic head-cleaning to remedy the situation (they actually told me that using two different brands of MiniDv media had caused the problem). Long story short, the camera completely died last week (two weeks after warranty expired). Canon Elura problems are widely reported on various camcorder forums. I have paid a premium for this lesson and just ordered my replacement from a manufacturer with a more solid reputation in terms of customer service. For the record, I love my Canon Powershot digital camera and have previously placed great faith in Canon products. That faith is now badly shaken."
2,bad zoom,"Got one for christmas when my daughter was born three years ago. The zoom went to maximum by itself all of the time. Sent it back and had it replaced. I used it for three years with no problem. Now the replacement does the same thing, and you can't stop it. Even on play back it zooms in. Unless you hold the zoom out all of the time it is worthless."
2,Zoom feature developed a mind of it's own. $300 dollar out of warranty repair bill,The zoom feature developed a mind of it's own. Camera started zooming in to the maximum and when you zoomed back out and let go of the control it zoomed in again. I paid $300 to have it repaired because I purchased extra batteries and the video light/flash too. I wanted to keep and use the accessory items instead of just upgrading to a newer and better camera. I should have saved the money and just bought another darn camera!
3,Canon Elura 65 problem,"I have enjoyed the camera for nearly 4 years. Beautful video, nice size, (not too small) and great lens quality like the previous Canon's I have owned. Last year the hatch quit opening. I don't mean the external cover, I mean the internal one where the DV tape is held. No reponse whatsoever, it doesn't even sound like its trying to open. It is out of warranty and I imagine is going to be extremely expensive to fix. Does anyone know of this problem? or a simple fix, Can I download a firmware update via usb that will help. I have had to go back to my old Canon 970 8mm for now and the Elura 65 sits on a shelf..."
1,Canon Elura camcorder are unreliable,"I dont have this model, but I had the Elura 40. For about 8 months, it works fine. Then it started having tape problems. The tape would not load correctly. Eventually it would not even open up for us to get the tape out. It seems like the entire Elura family of camcorders have this problem. After reading about all the headaches people have about repairs and yet the problem still exist, I've decided to trash the Elura 40 and never buy another Canon. JVC or Sony seems like a more reliable brand."
1,"Great idea, but will break very easily and won't work well on toilets!","I purchased this product after reading all the reviews and watching Claire's review video, but although it might work well on the bath tub or the sink, it does not work well on toilets. I tried unclogging my toilet possibly 10+ different times, but no matter how accurately I did it, my toilet is still clogged. Also, after less than 20 attempts, the pump broke and won't air seal broke and won't hold more than 4 pumps. (supposed to hold up to 20-30)So as much as great of an idea this product is, it won't really work on toilets (although it does work OK on tubs/sinks) and might break easily (mine broke in two days)."
1,Didn't Work Once,We just bought this. It wouldn't even work once. It would not hold any pressure upon being pumped up. The seals to the pump appeared to be defective. This seems to corroborate the other more recent reviews. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is either a scam or very poorly made.
1,Only useful on soft clogs,"This use a useful (if cheaply made) tool, and it may serve you well - if you only ever have easy clogs. Apparently whatever is blocking my bathroom sink fought back, so that when I pumped it 20 times (on the low end of their recommended ""20 to 30"") and shot the air down my drain, it blew out the weakest point on my pipes, which was the P trap. I guess completely redoing the drain is an effective way to deal with clogs.Save time, and get a snake instead."
4,Works good,"I had one for years that worked very well before it lost the ability to keep pressure. Bought another one. It works great, just make sure that there is water covering the top of it to make a seal and then press down hard with your body weight to prevent back splash. If you do that it works perfectly and will clear any clog. If you don't keep your weight on it and press down hard it will splash back in your face. Another solution is to drape an old bath towel over it before you press the trigger. That will stop any back splash. This is the best drain clog remover on the market. The only drawback is it is plastic and can not be fixed. I would buy a metal one in a minute, even for $100,if one was available."
2,failed imitation,Seemed like a promising device to unclog drains but failed to perform as expected. There is very little pressure released even after pumping it more than instructed. Ended up returning it.
2,Does not last,"A slow moving drain became less slow moving, but took a few blasts so it does work. It cannot handle serious clogs as the unit is small, and hence has limited power. However, after using the unit off and on for a month, the unit no longer holds the air pressure as I can hear a slow leak around the handle. When my neighbour first saw it he thought I had bought a toy, and I am inclined to agree. The good thing is it is inexpensive so two stars."
1,Seemed gimmicky and failed on first try,"So I gave it a try, pumped up the air and shot it into my drain a few times. The forth try well nothing happened when I pulled the trigger and it wouldn't work after that. The ""tool"" is all hard plastic and not even meant for basic home maintenance."
5,Works great,"This air pump drain opener works great on standard clogs in sink or toilet, with ease, much so more than standard plunger.. However, dont expect it to clean out the main drain sewer pipe clogs. your will still have to call a roto router man for that"
3,safe pumping and clears the clog,"puff away! You do need to read the instructions before use! we needed something that was more environmentally friendly and this was the one we tried first. Charge the air gun and we needed to puff over 20 times, to get the results we wanted. Maintenance required a lot less puffs! it is very easy to use and i wished they had a shield for those drain holes that had a cover that couldnt be removed. We managed to get the same effect by reversing the positin of one the shields! For the price, this is not bad at all, requires a little elbow grease, but I rather do this than pour more environmentally irresponsible liquid down the drain."
1,Double Beware!,"I bough mine at Lowes and I'm returning it the same day, as it didn't unclog my drain.This concept will only work if the restriction is between the sink and the first Y in the plumbing. If it is beyond the first Y, water and/or air will just head the other direction at the Y, rather than towards the restriction.No matter how hard you push down on the device and try to create a tight seal, water is going to splash everywhere. With a double kitchen sink, you have to have someone push down on a rubber stopper to try to prevent water from spraying up in that direction. You will both be soaked after using this; even with towels in the sink to absorb the spray. You will need a shower after using this device."
1,arrived broken,"air is leaking through the safety valve, and no pressure builds up. I belive I got a broken item. need to return it."
3,Not very hardy,"I have used this several times to dislodge clogs at home. Unfortunately, the plunger will develop heat and friction with repetitive pumping used for that resistant clog. There is a silicone seal inside the plunger that allows the device to develop pressure that is then released by the trigger. This seal is the problem. With repeated use, especially at one time, the seal either heats up or becomes damaged by the play in the plunger itself. When it binds, it tears and the pressure is lost and the device becomes useless. No replacement seals that I know of. However, with the fittings supplied, you can do the job of the $400 comparison professional kinetic water tools and use it as a disposable 20 times before you would break even with the expensive unit.I would buy again. Just wish there were replacement seals available."
2,Cobra 650 Air Drain Blaster,Had purchased item on 8/8/11 and received review request on 9/9/11. My comments are : firstly a different model was sent and received without any question; but after 3rd use on 11/11/11 the air pressure could not build up. Suspect the internal air check valve could have failed. Tried again on 11/21/11 but pressure could not build up and squeezing the trigger results in no air blast at all.Please feedback to your supplier and advise what can be done other than sending item back to you to incur air freight charges...
1,Not so good,The quality on this was not what I expected for the money.It works but I just thought it would have been made better
1,Absolute junk,"Have to give it one star, since zero stars is not allowed. I struggled with it for two years before giving up and replacing it. The crank handle broke off the first week; it fell over all the time when I pulled on the hose; it leaked from every connection. I replaced it with a Suncast (sp?) equivalent that cost only a little bit more, and is TEN TIMES better. Doesn't leak, doesn't tip over easily, rewinds like a dream."
1,Stay away from this product,"I bought this item from HomeDepot. It started leaking in the first season itself. I did a mistake of calling Ames about the leak, I should have returned to the store.Ames sent me parts, I replaced according to instructions. Leaking stopped then started again after a month. Called Ames again, they sent me parts again. This time leaking did not stop. Called Ames again, they sent me another part, replaced that too. Leaking does not stop. Finally called Ames for replacement, did not wanted to continue replacing parts. They refused to send replacement cart, they said they can only send parts and it should stop the leak.I gave up, garbaged this hose reel. Waste of my money and time. Shopping around to buy new one. Trying to decide between RapidReel Wall Reel and ReelSmart Outdoor Sink Station with Auto-Rewind."
1,Poor Design - Poor Materials,"I agree with all the other reviews here. The small device which keeps the handle secured into the upright position snapped when I was pushing my reel from over a distance of about 10 feet on smooth concrete. Without a lot of homemade repairs, I don't know how I would get this thing easily moved from place to place. Take everyone's advice - don't buy this reel. It's nothing but cheap junk."
1,Leaks ahoy!,"I concur with the other reviews. I have the product and it has leaked from the start. I tried taking it apart and getting to the source of the leak to no avail. Reeling the hose is handy, but if you want something that does not leak, look elsewhere."
1,Ames hose reel products leak,"Have tried several Ames hose reel products. They all leak. Ames will send replacement parts, but those leak. One product had wrong parts in kit and I couldn't finish assembly (Ames sent the correct part after a couple of weeks). Also, the plastic retainers holding the handle in the upright position break off, leaving the cart very difficult to move.Gave it one star because no stars was not an option..."
3,Easy to get parts!,"I have used several of these over the past 10 years, with biggish 5/8 hose, as much as would fit, which eventually makes them break i the middle. But with lighter or less hose they seem to last. I just had one spring a leak at the feed junction (first time for a leak for me and not total breakage). Was pleasantly surprised that their website had parts available, and even more surprised that it was just an order for which went directly to shipping..... no payment required!"
5,A different world,"I read this book about two years ago now. Since reading the book i have been doing the meditation (called the practice) twice a day, as it explains. I can only describe the whole experience as a relief. A relief at finally being able to see myself clearly and a relief at finally starting to get rid of all the crap I've picked up along the way. If the whole world read this book and did the practice it would be a very different place than it is today, i'd like to live in that kind of world."
2,buy at your own risk...,"Just as another reviewer said, the soft pads on the actual ear part just completely fell apart right after I took them off for the first time. I had them on for about thirty seconds just to see how good the sound is and the pads just came apart. I will obviously be returning these and looking for other headphones without the pads. I used to have another pair of Aiwa headphones that didn't come with the pads and actually had rubber around the ear part, which was a LOT better than the pads, but I have been having a tough time finding them.Anyway, the sound is good though, really strong bass, but I don't know how long the good sound will last since I'm going to return these headphones. It's probably not worth the risk with the pads though, so I would avoid. I'm giving two stars simply because the sound is good, but the quality is poor aesthetically."
2,I wouldn't buy these if I where you,"First off the soft stuff on the earphones degraded and fell off after my first use. After they fell of they really began to slice into my ears, painfully. Well they are very tight to begin with but after the padding is gone these will hurt like a mofo. Anyways, avoid these. They are pretty loud though.. only good quality."
2,Sugary sweet love poems--too much honey!,"Too much rhyme, too much honey-sweet sentimentality, adolescent yearning and such. Not my kind of poetry.But, if you're looking for a sweet, honey-thick poem to send your love, this book has them."
4,great scetn and deodarant,"I really like the scent in general and the deodorant is great. It contains NO alcohol. I'm uncomfortable with nearly all common brands, and tend to get rashes due to the alcohol. this one does the job with no side effects."
2,Allergy,I don't know if this product is a fake or not. But everytime my husband uses it he develops a rash. We bought the same polo blue from Macy's earlier and it worked fine.
1,Don't be fooled by the price!,"Even though you are saving between $7-$10(including taxes), the quality of the deodorant will disappoint you. The smell don't even last like the one I bought from Bloomingdale's. Scent is gone after an hour. This actually feels messy on your armpit unlike the one bought from Bloomingdale's where the substance applies onto your skin slowly. May be really old.......By the way, there was a piece of hair in one of the unused deodorant, I em editing this review since I saw it just now....By far very disgusting and disappointing."
3,These socks were about average as far as ...,"These socks were about average as far as dress socks go. If you need support for your lower legs, these are the socks for you. If you don't, they just look like """"grandpa"""" socks. The go all the way up to your knees."
2,"Futuro Support Socks, Men's","I've needed support socks since bypass surgery and, after trying several brands, settled on Futuro as definitely superior. Since the best price I've found was $13.99/pair at CVS drugs, I was pleased to find what appeared to be the same socks at $8.99/pair...so I ordered 3 pair.It turns out that, although the CVS and Amazon socks have the same model number and are packaged in identical boxes, the socks are very different. The CVS socks have a sticker on the box with a series of numbers ending in 00 whereas the Amazon sticker ends in 01. The CVS socks are woven with a soft fiber & cooler weave, have finger markings to designate the right side of each sock and are much easier to put on. The Amazon socks are woven with a hotter nylon without finger markings and are very difficult to put on. I quickly returned the Amazon socks and went back to buying the CVS socks albeit at a higher cost...it's definitely worth it."
4,"Not bad, but could be better.","I liked the art on this calendar, but it really wasn't as good as my 2003 calendar done by Michael Wheland. This one also has a little story that goes along with it that's pretty stupid and doesn't really add anything at all."
1,Not their best,"Last year's edition was much better. This one is a little ""weird"" (and that is coming from my die-hard fantasy fan husband). He loved last year' calendar (as did I), so I purchased this one with the same expectations. We were both disappointed, and tossed it. I think I'll go to the store next time and preview the art before I buy it, instead of trusting in the artist on a yearly basis. One star for the originality."
2,The Siegried & Roy of illustration,"Tutti-frutti colors, oiled models in static ""glamor"" poses, gimmicky affectations, and borrowed cliches (or I should say stolen, from Frank Frazetta). This is art for dumb people. I'm happy that ""Boris"", the narcissistic artiste with the blow-dried hair and the silk blouse opened to the navel, and his barbarians 'n' dragons-loving girl friend are making money off their preposterous, clueless kitsch. They are endearingly funny."
4,Broadway tunes,"This book is overloaded with broadway tunes. I would like more variety in the selections. Hal threw in a few Beatle tunes for variety. Could use more movie tracks and popular songs outside of the New York circle.There are a lot of songs in this book that I don't like or don't like enough to want to play them.The book is well made and the music is not terribly difficult. The words, vocal line, and cords are provided along with the piano line. Arrangements are mediocre."
4,Nice Book,"This is a good book with a lot of good selections of popular songs. However, I wish it was in a ring binder because it is difficult to keep it open. And like one of the other reviewers I would have liked to have seen a few more up to date songs and less Broadway songs. The songs that are in it are enjoyable to play and they do make you sound like a pro which makes me happy as it is so easy for me to NOT sound like a pro. An enjoyable book that I would recommend."
4,Best Songs Ever songbook,"Love the songs in this book. Most are easy arrangements, a few require some practice for the leisure pianist. Definitely recommend it."
3,Great for the price!,"Tent was easy to set up and take down. I was also able to fit a queen size air mattress which helped a lot! But it's just a plain, tent with no windows to open to let air in so it can get hot during the day!!"
2,to small for one,This is more of a kids tent.... I'm about 6ft and was to tall for it! Defiantly can't fit two... gave it to my brothers kids
2,Wouldn't recommend this shock,The price is low on this shock and you get what you pay for. I installed this shock on my VW Jetta. Only got about 50K miles before having to replace them. Don't think I will purchase them again.
3,Acceptable,Hickory is a hard wood hence has a heavier weight. 2 Pound Bag doesn't go very far. I have found that it is cheaper to buy wood chips in the local hardware store.
5,Great flavor!,"Since we discovered the smoker box, a new universe opened for us. These chips give a wonderful, distinc, yet not overpowering, flavor to our grilled meat. And it smells divine in our patio! We are hooked on this!"
1,worst chips ever!,"Charbroil Hickory Wood Chips, 2 Pound Bag arrived with a musty smell before I even opened the box. There was mildew on the chips so they had to be thrown out."
3,good chips TOO expensive,"Good chips. but, you can find just as good if not fresher at your local supermarket. for half if not 1/3 the cost."
4,Q the chips,"I find this real convenient for the occasional smokeout. Ok so I may not be an avid Q'er but these chips release their essence over a pretty long period when soaked long enough. Because they are chips, my preheat time is a lot less than logs or chunks. I usually soak in lukewarm water for 10 minutes or half hour in cold water and put em in little home-made al-foil packets with holes. The warm water actually softens the wood more so the smoke is long and slow. Really great on ribs and poultry. So good am now a repeat buyer."
2,All Hickory Chips Are Not Created Equal?,"I figured all hickory chips are basically the same; these prove that they're unfortunately not.I used Kingsford hickory chips (green/tan paper bag) all last summer in my old Weber, and grilled up some of the best BBQ chicken I've ever had.I recently ran out of the Kingsford, and picked up these Charbroil chips at the hardware store.I used the same technique as usual (soaking chips, putting in tinfoil, placing on coals, let smoke for final 15 minutes) and the flavor just wasn't the same. Not bad, per se, but not nearly as tasty as the Kingsford. These chips imparted a slightly more bitter, smokey flavor, instead of the stronger hickory flavor of the Kingsford.Unless I just got a bad batch, I would say you should go with a different brand of chips; I recommend the Kingsford.Happy grilling!"
5,GREAT FOR SMOKING,"Short of having a Hickory tree in your back yard to get chips from, these worked very well when smoking meats and fowl in my Weber smoker!"
4,Hickory chips,I have used these chips on fish and pork. Flavor was good for pork but a littke strong for trout. Recommed using Alder or Apple wood for fish.
5,Great snuggle buddy!,"This is a pretty great toy! It was a bit smaller than I had anticipated, but an accurate octopus- there is a siphon and even a beak!! Totally soft and squishy and lovable!"
2,single-season use,After the 3rd one I'm calling it quits. I can't seem to get through a single summer without it starting to leak internally at the barrel hose connection. I've had the same problem with two different models. At least the ground under it gets a good watering.
2,Por Quality,I was going to replace my Ames Reel Caddy that was 8 years old with this one but I decided to keep my old one instead. The connector hose is very poor quality and was already kinked when it arrived. The first time I tried to use this unit it had an internal leak that was really bad. I decided to keep my old reel caddy that didn't leak and return this one. Very poor quality!
5,Just perfect,"This came right on time, easy to assemble and fits right in my side yard space. It's a breeze to roll and unroll."
2,Garden hose holder for the deck,"Disappointed in the small size..very close to the ground/deck which doesn't allow sufficient clearance for easy use. However, easy to put together."
2,Misrepresentation by Amazon,"This product has been misrepresented by either Amazon or the company itself. Such a disappointment. You need to check the photo in ad vs. the actual product, or, make sure that the company agrees with a photo by Amazon in their advertisement."
1,Save your money!,"The manufacturer uses a black plastic pipe to connect the bit of hose that connects to the water source to pipe water into the main hose. Unfortunately, the black pipe is so narrow that it creates a lot of back pressure. This back pressure forces a good amount of water out of the smaller hose despite o-rings (spraying irritatingly all over the place) instead of out of the main hose. Yes, water does come out of the main hose, but when almost half of the water comes spraying out of the wrong place....it makes this hose reel useless."
3,"Works ok, but will not last","Had to tighten the grey hose since it was leaking and finally popped off. This was on my lower pressure faucet, I will not even try on the higher pressure one as it would probably explode."
1,total waste of money,"Pros: Looks like a hose reel. Went together easliy. Holds hose.Cons: Fell apart easliy. leaks like crazy. Blew apart completely after about the 2rd use and perhaps 3 months later. If you dont have the cash to buy a real reel, just save your money and you'll be a lot happier. All of the Ames and Suncast products likes sprinklers and spray nozzles and this reel are total garbage. You get what you pay for with this item for sure, so dont act shocked when it fails. I am looking for a $100 plus reel now and havent found it yet. for now I have the stationary non rotating rack that hangs the hose on the wall by draping over it, no moving parts, totally manual operation, only thing to fail is if the hose leaks, which isnt sold by Ames."
2,Total piece of crap.,"I own 2 ames hose reels that on going on 8 years old. They are now discontinued and I needed another reel for a new faucet I installed. I ordered this hose reel expecting it to be the same quality as my other Ames hose reels. Well boy was I wrong. As soon as I opened the box I felt how flimsy and poorly built the item was. When i mounted it on the wall, the whole reel flexed back and forth as I rolled the hose up. The plastic was smoother and felt much cheaper- almost like the plastic used to make plastic storage bins. What a shame, oh well. I'm sending this hunk of plastic back to amazon."
4,More than a hose reel,I actually bought this reel to store my heavy duty 100 foot electric extension cord. This cord is heavy and difficult to coil by hand and then when extended it often tangles. The reel has soloved this problem. I did mount the reel on a plywood base for stability.
3,Hose Reel Caddy,I didn't know what to expect but it seems to be ok. When i hooked it up it leaked but was able to stop the leak by tighting the hose clamp with a screw driver.
5,Great product!,We have 4 Ames True Temper Reel Easy Hose Reel Caddies. Ames has an incredible 2-year warranty and they stand behind their very well made products.
2,Meh,"First season was great. Second season is unwatchable. The changed some of the actors and clearly the writers, too. Unreal and unfunny. Not even the always fabulous Judy Davis can save it."
2,Tragic downgrade of promising first season,They clearly ran out of money for this season as they got unknowns to replace celebrities from the first season and the writing budget must have only paid for some college kid churning out stuff between classes because this is a disaster. LOVED the first season. Couldn't watch one whole episode of this. So sad as I LOVE Judy Davis.
3,The starter wife season 2,"I loved the first season and was so disappointed in the second. When all of the characters get changed it ruins everything. The whole thing was not followed up well at all, could have been great!"
2,I suppose I got what I paid for.,I bought these stockings because the price was so good. I have only worn them once. I was not impressed with the compression.I have a pair of Venosan compression stockings. They cost 10 times more than what I paid for the Futuro...but are a hundred times better. I think its a good idea to pay more and get better compression.
2,It's OK if it doesn't fall apart.,I own two of this and both have fallen apart after a year. Tread came off the wheel on one and the pins that hold the wheels came off the other. I would not recommend this product.
2,Edger,This came in great shape but is difficult to use & pretty useless for me. I would not recommend it unless you are strong.
1,"After just 60' of use, the tool bent and is unusable","I am not as strong a guy as I used to be anymore, so I took it easy when with my new Ames edger. My gas powered unit was not working and I thought I should get some manual exercise so I bought at Home Depot as a impulse purchase (Amazon price was better).I found the edger did its job, but lots of manual labor soI took it slow and easy.I was sort of shocked when I looked at the edger after finishing about 60' of the lawn and finding the entire unit had bent 40 degrees.While I had read a bad review on Amazon, my past experiences with an older Ames edger was so good I decided to buy anyway.It seems that the quality has declined dramtically as my experience of bending was mentioned by other reviewers as well.I cannot recommend this tool even for light use based on my experience."
1,Edger not so much.,"I didn't want to spend upward of $150 bills for an electric or gas edger. So I thought I could save some money and go ""Old School."" But, I just ended up throwing $45 bucks away.The wheel does not rotate easliy. It is very difficult. This requires the user to exert a lot of downward force to create enough friction for the wheel to catch the sidewalk and to cause the blades to rotate. I edged about 5 feet of my lawn and stopped. I tried adusting the tension plate to no avail.You are better off with a pair of scissors."
1,Not worth it,"I agree with many of the comments here. This edger is not worth the money. It bends easily, the wheels don't turn (they just slide along the sidewalk), and it's tough to use. Definitely would NOT recommend this edger."
1,Avoid this edger.,"I purchased the Ames grass edger from Home Depot this afternoon and I just got back from returning it for a refund. I used the edger for less than two minutes before the mounting brackets that attach the edger to the wooden handle bent to the point that the edger was no longer usable. In that short time, the edger performed a decent job and its too bad that the manufacturer used such flimsy materials in the construction of this tool. Avoid this edger."
1,bent on first use,"Product is garbage, it bent as others have stated on first us. The outer brackets holding the wheels are beyond cheap. Will be returning product."
1,It doesn't do the job!,I could not get the thing to work. The wheels would not turn and I ended up just scraping it along the sidewalk. I tried adjusting it and every other option I could think of to no avail. Save your money and invest in another product. I would not recommend this edger at all.
2,Must be very strong to use,"Not impressed with this tool. You must be very strong to use, especially if the lawn has overgrown for quite some time at the edge. You must go over many times before the blades finally cut through the sod at a steep angle. I found that my steel shovel worked better on tough areas. The tool only seems to work well if the lawn edge is already in decent shape to begin with. Recommend you try something else."
1,Disgraceful Quality,I purchased an Ames Rotary Edger at Home Depot because I had urgent edging work to be done. The tool was worthless. It bent and was completely unusable within one minute of beginning edging.I have used many such tools in the past that were much more ruggedly build.It is completely disgraceful that the brand of the oldest company in the USA (Ames) would be placed on such cheap Chinese manufactured crap. I find this to be generally true of many of the Ames Tools available today.To their credit Home Depot accepted the worthless product back for a credit without question.
4,Helio Breaker Review,"This B-Daman doesnt have much other than it's stablizers. They can help support alot of back weight, they are my favorite next to Kouryuoh's. As for the arms...alot of people speculate Hasbro changed them from the original Takara mold, I dont know if this is true though."
4,Helio Breacker is COOL!,I think Helio Breacker is cool except I don't like the point when his Helio horns fall off and he should have had more power.
5,Best leash for quick stops,"This is my second hitch leash, my friend borrowed my first one and lost it.....it wasn't because of quality. This leash is the best for taking your dog to the beach or any public area in which you need to tether your dog to go into a shop. It has an easy latch and it's adjustable."
3,Blade Screenplay,"A good read, although if you are a huge fan of the film and know it well, you will most likely not find much more in this book. The book is based on the screenplay, and hence follows the film almost word-for-word, with little additional character analysis. For die hard fans only."
1,First one was defective; second one is fine,Easy to set-up but it leaks internally. It's going back. My old Ames seemed to be built better than this one.Update After One Season of Use:The replacement works as very well. Amazon return policy made returning the old one easy and fast.
1,Junk,"I ordered and received this hose reel in August. When trying to attach a hose to the outlet connection it cross-threaded and destroyed the sorry plastic connection. Called AMES Customer Service on the phone to order the replacement 2-piece inlet outlet connections for my howe reel. Ames sent me a one piece inlet-outlet connection that is obviously for some other product. I contacted them again via their parts web site which clearly showed the hose reel I purchased, and I reordered the two piece inlet-outlet connection. Today, I again received the same damn one piece part which does not fit in my hose reel. So I spent $70.00 on a junk product for which I cannot receive the correct replacement parts.Ames must be staffed by fools and it is impossible to talk with a ""live"" person. Now, I hate Ames and am just going to have to junk the hose reel. My advice is DON'T EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AMES TRUE TEMPER."
2,dissapointing,"awkward, unwielding, Turns over easily, hose does not feed evenly. I have only 150 feet on a 200+ hose reel. It barely fits and is a pain to mess with, not exactly time saving"
1,Flimsy,"I was happy when this hose cart arrived. It is easy to set up. However, it is very flimsy. With the weight of the hose, the cart was difficult to move around and the handle eventually snapped out of place. This is not a very durable product."
4,Good product for long 3/4 inch hose storage,I use this hose reel card for a 150ft 3/4 inch hose. Reeling in the hose is very light. I would prefer aluminum hose connectors outside and inside.
1,Like the product but it came broken :( Update: Don't like at all,"This seems to be a great hose cart but when I opened the box the side was shattered. Now the hose falls over the side that's broken.Update: New product arrived and was not broken. Unfortunately, the cart has 2 leaks in it, the handle will not lock in place, and the wheels lock up and can't be moved."
2,hose caddy,Ames True Temper True Temper Reel Easy Hose Reel Caddy #2386375The brass connector that screws on to the faucet is remarkably thin. I doubt that it can withstand a moderate knock without bending.
2,nice item,I like this cart. I got it on sale for $15 shipped and I would recommend it at that price to everyone.edit: It didn't last very long so I don't even know if it was worth the reduced price.
4,More good music from these guys...,"Harem Scarem are one of,if not the best kept secrets on the melodic rock scene.I'm not going to review every song,so that the listener may decide for themselves. I would say that this is a good cd,BUT,I would say it is a notch below their self titled debut,as well as ""mood swings"" and ""weight of the world"".But then again,the majority of their work has been near perfect thus far,so I guess a 4 star release isn't too shabby either.Check this out AFTER you have heard their other releases."
2,Not impressed,"I'm not impressed with the quality of this marble set because the blocks which have a curved tunnel are carved roughly and there is only one way to set them up so that the marble doesn't just stop in the tunnel. If the inside of the tunnel was smooth and more carefully designed, the marbles would roll like they should.When I was a kid, I had a fantastic wooden marble run set, but nothing on the market seems to be an equivalent. Most of the sets have holes in the the lengthy pieces for the marbles to drop through. I think that without the holes there are more possibilites for set up.However, my four year old does enjoy this set. I play with her and have shown her how to change the set up when the marble stops."
1,Freezes up the system...,"This card reader sounds like a great idea, but it unfailingly freezes up my system. Tech support first said I needed to update the 4-in-1 Via motherboard drivers on my system, but that failed to work, and I'm ready to return the product."
1,Sandisk Imagemate... not so good!,"I have the Windows 2000 operating system, and I found that this piece of equipment corrupted my computer. I installed it as the instructions say... instantly my computer froze, shut down, and then screwed up my graphics card drivers. I reformatted my computer losing nearly everything I had, and tried to install the imagemate again. Again, it did the same, however, this time it did not corrupt my files. Whether or not this was just a malfunctioning imagemate, I don't know, but i'm sure if I would have exchanged rather than returned, I might have got one that worked. The reviews say it all, but mine didn't work!"
5,A Must for Digital Camera Users,"I own a Cannon PowerShot S100, and was sick of using the complicated transfer software that came with it after only one day. My friends who reccommended the camera also reccommended this SanDisk drive, and its made things a whole lot easier. It's natively supported by Windows XP--this means you can plug it into your USB port and XP will recognize it (no need to use the installation disk) and place a link to it inside your ""My Computer"" folder.Transfer is surprisingly quick, though if you want to edit your pictures it's better to transfer them off the disk first. And, if you're low on USB ports, it has no problem being hotswapped (unlike a few other devices I have). Very easy to use--makes your CompactFlash card act just like a Zip disk or data CD. Highly reccommended."
5,Nice with Windows XP,"I bought the SanDisk card reader out of frustration trying to get my Polaroid PDC 1100 to work with Windows XP. To install, all you have to do is turn off the computer, plug in the USB cable, and turn the computer back on. W-XP recognizes it and there's nothing else to do. Unfortunately, the instructions don't tell you this (it's on the SanDisk website) and you don't use the CD that comes with the product. Once the card is inserted, you can view the thumbnails in Windows Explorer, drag and drop to other folders, etc. A lot easier than downloading from the camera."
2,Great when it works and doesn't crash the system,"I looked at the other reviews here and bought this with a 256MB card and a Canon S30. I run Win 98 so anticpated no major problems. However the CD crashed my system, botched my email for a week and even then would not uninstall. After a week of frustration and intermittent working (when not crashing the system) I finally managed a complete uninstall by having to manually delete the folder from my C drive. My email subsequently worked, but on reinstallation the reader still would not work. I then uninstalled (success first time!) and downloaded the driver from the Sandisk website with (so far) success. The driver has worked twice with only minor problems (which may have been due to me removing the card early as the Eject command is not present on the new software, but I am contacting SanDisk about that).So in summary - OK, but what a hassle. If it still does not work or wrecks email again it is going back."
3,But what about support?,"I have an older SanDisk Imagemate and was very happy with it under Mac OS 9, but it has no support under Mac OS X. SanDisk support just say ""too bad, buy a new one with Mac OS X support"". So basically, if you're going to buy anything from SanDisk, keep in mind it may not be future proof, they may decide just to abandon you and con you in to buying a new model. No thanks!"
1,A PIECE OF JUNK!,Using Mac G4 and OS 9.2.2. Downloaded newest drivers from SanDisk website. When plugged into USB port won't allow the computer to shut down or restart. Puts 2 icons on desktop when compact flash card is inserted. Very difficult to insert compact flash card. Consigned to garbage can. A complete waste of [money] plus postage. Too bad - I've had good luck with SanDisk products before.
2,Windows ME users beware,This product will not work with Windows ME. I have tried everything that tech support had to offer. Do NOT install drivers from the CD. Put it on my wife's older computer with 98SE and it worked fine. But if you are a Windows ME user get ready to be frustrated.
4,Works fine.,"I have had this one for a while, and while it worked fine under Win98, it did not like WinXP. Uninstall it and let the built-in XP drivers set it up and you'll have no problems. If you own a digicam, you must have a card reader or you're missing the beauty of simple integration."
4,Worth the price; no need to use digital camera for transfers,"For the price it sells at, I found this a very useful accessory. Not only can I avoid using the digital camera for actual photo transfers to my PC, it also saves the battery in the camera. Also, it doesn't require a separate power cord/supply because it gets it power from the PC through the USB cable. It can also help avoid the wear-and-tear on your digital camera. I used it with Windows 2000 Pro SP1 and then later with SP2."
1,Incompatibility City!,"AVOID!!!Windows 98: This product is not compatible with Adaptec CD Creator and Direct CD software, which came installed on my Dell system for burning CD-ROM's. SanDisk tech support had me make some changes to my system, which resulted in my CD-ROM no longer working. SanDisk would not help my restore my system, referring me to Adaptec support (who couldn't help because their software came pre-installed on my 2-year-old system). I eventually had to upgrade to Windows XP to get my CD-ROM working again.Windows XP: Although the driver for the ImageMate is fully integrated in XP (and works really nicely), the device must be plugged into a built-in USB port. It doesn't work when plugged into an external USB hub, so unless you're willing to dedicate your only built-in USB port (or one of your two ports) to this device, you can't use it. SanDisk says they will not support the device if it's plugged into a hub."
5,The Beginning,"Emerald Eyes begins the story of the Castanaveras telepaths, the greatest science fiction I've personally ever read. Though Emerald Eyes seems more of a prequel than the true first of the series, it is a powerful story in its own right, and all the better since it leads into the amazing books to follow. Those first starting the series may want to consider starting with The Long Run first as I did. I enjoyed learning the characters as they were entering their prime, and then returning to learn about their youth. Whichever order you read them, I'm sure you will become as big a fan of this outstanding series as I."
4,Espresso Beechwood Shelf 4,"Great product for what I use it for, towels in a bathroom. But I did put an oil based air freshner on the top shelf that leaked and it took the finish off, so its not the highest quality, but its good for the price."
3,a bit flimsy but servicable.,"The product arrived well packaged.There were no leaks initially, although it does have a leak at the reel after a few months service. That can be fixed.The major drawback is the flimsy construction and feel of the plastic frame and reel.I find myself treating the unit very carefully.That said, the unit is servicable but I don't see this lasting too long."
3,limited applicability,"The maxim ""you get what you pay for"" applies to this item. This hose caddy is limited to 1/2 inch hoses, my 3/4 hose does not work well with it. The connections to the main hose and to the one on the inside of the caddy are of cheap construction, and one has to worry that the connections will either leak or burst if you have continuous pressure on the unit. I will give this caddy to my daughter who has 1/2 inch water hoses and look for a more stable, better quality caddy."
2,Mine leaked too,"I had this product for about 5 years. It leaked a bit from the start. I ensured washers were in place. I replaced washers. Nothing worked. The leak wasn't terrible, but it was annoying.I will say that winding up the hose was really easy and nice. There is a foot handle on the base that you can stand on that allows you to crank away.After 5 years the leak got bad -- a plug blew out on the crank attachment. I am searching for a new one now. I won't buy this one again."
3,Caution May be In Order.,I purchased this unit on December 31st (from another retailer). I wasn't sure I would like Sirius and with the rebate it came to only $8. By February 6th (around) I noticed that the unit would go back on when I turned it off. On February 1th the unit stopped turning on and ceased operating completely.I use it only at home with the home kit that it came with. I bought The Inspire Creative T3000 speakers from Amazon to attach to the unit.The speakers are fine (sound great when attached to my Mac) but the unit itself wasn't able to play many of the channels in stereo. The sound sounded a little tiny at times.Also-the lack of numbers on the remote or unit makes it somewhat cumbersome to change channels. You need to move a cursor along a number line that is displayed on the screen of the unit.
1,avoid this company,"I am in complete agreement with Aaron, avoid this model and Xact. After 1 month unit froze up with Sirus displayed. Two weeks after warranty retun was asked to send the remote or $5.95 or they won't fix it. The bad control head has nothing to do with the remote! Good luck ever talking to a human on the ""cusomer service"" number."
1,"BIG WASTE OF MONEY, NO REFUNDS EITHER !!","My unit worked for 3 weeks then the FREEZE happened. They promised replacement and off I mailed it. 3+ weeks later I got the same unit back "" repaired "". It worked for almost 10 days and Froze again. I went out and bought a different product "" Starmate "" and I am very happy with it. It does not run HOT like the XACT ( so hot, I was afraid of fire ). I wrote XACT and asked for a refund for this waste of money and they told me NO REFUNDS, only replacement. I threw the unit in the garbage and will eat my losses. However, I will post this review on every Internet page possible. I owned it for 9 weeks and it worked for almost 4 weeks. My sirius account was also wasted . I am upset at the poor product, poor service and poor customer relations. This company will be out of business in no time I am sure."
1,"Customer service is atrocious, unit is garbage","My receiver shorted out after less than four months. I shipped it back, minus the remote and two months later I get a bill for $160 to replace the unit since it didn't have everything.I have put in @7 calls to customer service and they are the worst I've ever dealt with. They won't fix the receiver, won't send a new one because ""they don't open blister packs"" just to send the receiver back.Bottom line, there are tons of other options, these guys do not deserve any of your money. Go elsewhere."
3,"It's sort of okay, but sirius isn't","I had no problem installing the unit or activating it. Unfortunately, it was all uphill from there.The remote is unwieldy and not very intuitive, for one thing.Then there were the frequent daily periods during which I experienced signal loss.I would have put up with all of this, however, if it wasn't for the fact that music sounded horrible (I mean painfully unlistenable), and the talk channels sounded worse than most bad Internet feeds.I thought it was the receiver itself until I listened to two other Sirius receivers including the most expensive consumer home stereo component. They all sounded exactly alike.So I concluded thatSirius is using an inferior data encoding method, and decided to try XM. I'm glad I did. The signal is perfect, and music is pleasant to listen to. Even the Old Time Radio channel and sports broadcassts sound great. It appears that XM doesn't skimp on the band width."
2,Look elsewhere for Sirius hardware,"I purchased this Xact XTR1 after my previous unit stopped working after 2 years use. The only reason I purchased a replacement XTR1 is I already have the car kits professionally installed in 2 cars and own the boom-box which would be useless without a replacement. I am gambling that Sirus hardware will improve if the XM merger is approved. Why?Because Xact Communications makes poorly engineered crap! It is so inefficient that it becomes too hot to touch when operating. It does pull in the satellite signal adequately, but the panel is awkward and memory functions are not intuitive. The remote has volume controls that are only for show--they are not functional. That gives you a hint to the quality of the design.I like Sirius programming, but I will NEVER buy anything made by Xact communications again!"
4,Still a Good Deal,"These units have a relatively short life, due to heat issues, but they are still the least expensive portable units out there (with the addition a Power Pod), at a fraction of the price of the Stiletto, with a powerful FM transmitter. But at these prices, still a very good deal."
3,works as advertised,The unit works well but lacks some newer features found on more advanced units. Also the way the cords go into the unit and the starting size of the cup holder mount made in unusable in my cars cup holder. It works great in the separate boom box that I use outdoors.
3,"Works, but not user-friendly","We got two of these radios in late 2004. At the time, it was my only experience with any Sirius tuner. From the time I installed them I realized they were not very user friendly. Then 2 days after install, the LCD on one of them failed. I sent it back to Xact for replacement.The way the presets are set up, it is very cumbersome; 6 stacks of 3 presets. If you are on stack B and want A, you have to scroll all the way around to get to A. The direct channel tune option is a joke as neither the unit nor the remote have numbers on them. Another issue is the mounting options. The car mount that comes with it is horrible and the way the wires terminate in the bottom makes it very hard to use a vehicle specific mount.As far as doing what is should, it does. I used my for over a year, and it always worked. My wife still has one in her car and likes it.I ended up replacing the one in my truck a Starmate Replay. It is much better."
1,Didn't work out of box; rude customer service,"After a week the receiver still hasn't picked up a signal. I've tried it both in the car (w/ the auto adapter unit) and in the boombox but have yet to get a signal. XACT customer service is unfriendly and fairly difficult to work with...they don't seem to believe me that I can't ""acquire a signal"". After a few emails and a phone call I get to return the unit at my expense and wait an unspecified amount of time for a replacement. Meanwhile, I get to pay for a service (SIRIUS) I can't use. Try JVC, those who are using JVC receivers around here don't seem to have any problems."
1,Xact Xsucks,"Has a warranty issue after only 1 month, talked to their customer service, sent in my reciever and never heard back from them. I finally called them to find out what was going on and was told they would not ship the new one because I didn't send in the remote. I owed the $9.95! and if I wanted to send in the remote it would take at least another 2 weeks before I saw it. One of the worst customer service departments I EVER dealt with!!!!"
5,PERFECT,This is one of five (5) Sirius Radios that I use and are active. Fun to use with my boom box and the portable pod. Receives very well.
1,Defective,Must have been factory rejects but not tested. went through 6 of them and not one worked. Should have been tested.
2,Worked 5 minutes,"Received worked 5 minutes working with company on replacement hope it go's well. Try ed to contact Xact the manufacturer with no response. I do like this model and have had about 3 over the last 5 yrs, they don't seem to last that long.I sure hope Amazon helps with the replacement process."
2,A piece of junk,"It should come as no surprise that the XTR1 is very crappy receiver that SIRIUS threw together when sat radio was in its infancy. However, I am just trying to get one more year out of it before I cancel my radio. I refuse to buy a whole new setup. This is my 3rd radio in about 2 years and this one had problems the moment I pulled it out of the box. It would just stop playing music and freeze up while on a channel and it wouldn't allow me to change the channel, so I had to constantly power it off and then power it back on. It hasn't done this recently, so maybe that glich is gone? Now the display goes in and out where sometimes you can see it, other times it goes almost completely black. Anyway, the point is, I wouldn't buy this radio if you are starting fresh, but it's cheaper to keep buying these receivers if you already have a radio that requires the XTR1 receiver than it is to buy a whole new radio."
3,Sirius Satellite Radio,I used this product with the portable pod and had no trouble with the unit. As long as the product it's paired with had good antennae reception it will work fine.
2,It lasted for four years,"This receiver lasted four years, until the husband got lazy and decided to never turn it off. It lived as long as it did because we were diligent about turning it off when we weren't using it. It does get very, very hot. Maybe he was subconsciously angling for an upgrade? In any event, it's inexpensive and we had no significant problems- though it is currently obsolete."
1,DIDN'T GET WHAT I ORDERED,"Apparently they were out of this pillowcase, so they sent me something totally different. I returned it. Big disappointment"
2,unlikable heroine,"Linda Fioretti moved to Rumor, Montana after she divorced her lying, cheating husband. There she meets local carpenter Tag Kingsley when he comes to do work on her apartment. Tag's a widower with a young daughter. There is an immediate attraction between Tag and Linda. Since his wife's death, Linda is the first woman he's wanted in his life. Strange things keep happening to Linda. A strange man keeps coming to her door in costumes, a stranger enters her apartment when she's gone but Tag is there painting, etc.I really wanted to like this book because Tag is such a great hero. He is sexy and sensitive. His relationship with his daughter is touching. The problem with the book and the reason I didn't like it is Linda. She is just totally unlikable and unreasonable. Any concern that Tag shows her sends her over the edge but she doesn't seem at all bothered by the stranger that seems to be stalking her even after she knows he's been in her apartment. Skip this one; it's not worth it."
4,great part,I would have given 5 stars and the part itself seems worthy of them but the caliper came with a core return tag and there is no where to send it back to so I could have gotten a few dollars back by getting the core refund if there was a place to send it.
3,Generally good headphones...,"These headphones were great for about 6 months. They had great sound quality for the price, were very comforable, and the closed headphone design prevented outside sounds from ruining the music. After 6 months though, the screws on the sides of the adjustment band started coming lose and falling out. The headphones would then fall off the band and require tedious work to put back together. Eventually, the screws cracked the plastic and I had to super glue it all together. Overall they are good headphones, but be extremely careful with how much use they receive and how you use them."
3,Adequate Value,"Whenever I can't resist the price on an item, said item turns out to be okay at best and these headphones are no exception. Acceptable sound quality, but pretty weak on the bass. Mute button, located on rear of left cup, has to be held down to effect mute rather than acting as a locked control. No volume adjustment control, which is something I've had available on even cheaper headphones.Bottom line: You get what you pay for. Will instantly become my backup pair when I take the time to research and purchase a better quality set."
2,Not great,"My pair broke after the warranty expired so I was pretty mad about that; it seemed like the noise came out of one side more than the other from the beginning, and the problem grew greatly as they wore on, rendering them useless. Also, the headphones are somewhat uncomfortable; they make your ears feel really hot after 30 minutes. I am very disappointed with the bass. Bass gets very distorted at high levels. I have a pair of Sony headphones that came with my Sony Walkman D-E350 and they reach MUCH higher levels of bass than this. The cord is WAY too long and the mute button is a pretty much useless feature. Overall, it's a (less than) average product in a nice package. Purchase the Sennheiser 497s instead."
3,Got what I paid for,"I picked up a pair of these at Best Buy for a pretty good price, mostly for watching TV without disturbing the wife late at night, and while the quality was good, I've been underwhelmed by the sound. I like that they're closed (I've never liked those ""airy"" headphones) but they don't produce nearly enough bass without having to crank up the bass settings. My major gripe is that although they're only a couple of years old, and haven't been used much, the synthetic material on the ear cups is flaking off. I'm looking for a replacement pair, and I think I'll up my spending limit this time."
2,"Comfortable, Good Sound, but lacking Quality.","I bought these headphones less than a year ago. They were pretty comfortable for the most part. They were also a bit heavy, but still comfortable. The sound quality was decent but after a year they stopped working for no reason. They had been well cared for and never used anywhere but in my home. And forget about trying to repair them. In my experience with Aiwa, their products just don't seem to hold up for long. Very disappointing."
5,"Great product, great feel!","First of I have an extremly large head and trying to find some headphones that don't pinch my big head was a challenge... But my quest ended here! These are some of the first headphones that fit all sizes with out pain. They also offer great sound quality, and they mute most of the sound around you, so don't drive with these on..."
4,Excellent but not for a lifetime,I've had a pair of these for about 3 years now and I have enjoyed the sound quality. However the ear cups are now disintegrating. The last time I wore them I had black specs all over my face when I took them off. I only hope I can find another pair I'll like as much as these!
2,Big pack for 2 seeds,Surprised to find only 2 seeds in the pack.2 seeds .... 2 starsPut 5 seeds in next time
4,A few tomatoes,"Not all of the seeds sprouted. But I'll plant the rest in the spring. Hopefully, they will all sprout then. Maybe I planted at the wrong time. We did get a few small tomatoes, tho."
1,No stars!,"No stars. Planted them in a small planter to get seedlings and they never sprouted! Threw my money away! Obviously no guarantees for germination... Looked like a good idea, though."
3,pretty solid stuff,"I bought this over 20 years ago in a vinyl cut-out bin for next to nothing.Never heard of them before.I was surprised to find that this was a pretty good,creative,rockin'LP.Ballads,spacey pop,and straight ahead hard rock.Yalla yea,and para dice are excellent.It would've been worth the full price instead of the 69 cents."
4,Nice budget SDC,"I bought two of these for use mainly in my home ""studio"" for drum overheads, piano, acoustic instruments etc.Mine are nice looking and reliable. They have a lower self noise than many SDC mics at much higher price points.I have never had any trouble with them in the studio and have even taken them into the field for recording.They are very useful and mine get used very often. If I had a larger budget I may have chosen a different SDC, but I'm actually I tried the GXL1200 as I have always achieved very good results. I don't really plan to replace them with more expensive SDCs for my purposes at the moment as sort of my home recording is for songwriting purposes. If I lose one or it gets stolen, I would most likely replace it with another GXL1200.I think they would suit most amateurs and hobbyists quite well."
2,You get what you pay for.. Really,"I like to review good products and let everyone know what is worth buying.These mics ARE NOT!The only reason I am reviewing this mic is because I read a lot of reviewsthat talk about these mics are as good as the upper end mics. THAT IS NOTTRUE!I tried recording with these in my studio in several applications and in allinstances they fail, BIG TIME!I used them for drum overheads, for cymbals, vocals, and guitar. Not one appdid I get even a decent sound.Yeah they are cheap, but unless you are looking for a cheap sound SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
3,Mediocre,"I bought this microphone since it was an inexpensive condenser microphone which seemed to handle a great frequency range. Unfortunately, it doesn't replicate the sound that well and seems to lower the pitch a little. I didn't expect this from this mic since it's supposed to be for vocals. The quality of the sound from the microphone is really good however."
4,Good Product Overall,"I purchased this item a week ago and so far, I am impressed with it. AIWA's sound quality is always excellent and impressive. But there are some cons that you might consider before buying the product. First of all, the headphone has poor quality earbuds. When I wore it for the first time, it was very uncomfortable and hurt my ears. But after listening to it for about 3 days, I got used to it. There are many pros also. The swoops AIWA headphones are very stylish. Plus, their sound quality is noticeably preferable than any other headphones. Fortunately, amazon offers the same headphone with the remote control which gives more preference. Overall, this is a desirable item. But if you are aspiring for a heaphone with comfort and decent sound, I would recommend SONY's behind-the-neck or clip-ons(which I own and they are very comfortable). But if you are aiming for finest and superb sound quality, give AIWA swoops a try."
2,A turn-off.,"I was very disappointed in these earphones after reading all the great reviews. I found the bass sorely lacking, and the earphones themselves uncomfortable. If they weren't pushed far enough into your ears, the sound lacked. If they WERE far in enough, they were uncomfortable. Plus, the plastic linking the earphones kept brushing my shirt collar as I moved, interfering with the music..."
2,Not so good,"I was pretty disappointed with the bass.... they are very lightweight and are good for the gym, but I have ditched them for my old Koss KTX/Pro headphones, which have much better sound and a volume control built into the cord.... I would recommend them over these any day despite the less 'trendy' look."
3,Looks better in pic,"I finally got it...I sent it back the same day.I don't know, it just didn't look as high-grade as I thought. It didn't seem like these kinda little headphones could throw some real sound out. Plus I hated the earbud design, just how it's suppose to look on you when it's on. I'll admit these are one of the better looking pairs, though. That's what I get for ordering online, didn't get what I expected. I'm getting a ... Sony pair...those I'm sure will work out better for me.--Daniel"
2,Poorly structured and written,"I was enrolled in Laughter & Humor, a course taught at UMBC by Robert R. Provine (author of the book) and I dropped the class after only two-weeks of enrollment. The book is written like a textbook but is structured in a novel format. The chapters are very short, but the amount of detail within one paragraph makes it nearly impossible to know what to study. When discussing the first exam, Provine suggested that we just read and analyze every sentence from Chapters One thru Three. This book is no laughing matter!"
3,Scientific Review,"It's a REALLY informative book; if you're doin' a paper or someth'n, but if you're try'n to learn to be funny, like I am, it's not really helpful - interesting, but not what I was looking for."
2,Laughter is caused by a stuttering brain,"Yes, yes, I know. Provine studied thousands of people but, what he failed to grasp is that laughter is the result of a ""stuttering"" brain. A person is confronted with anxiety and, the brain ""stutters"" and releases the vocalizations we call laughter. This brings the brain (rather mind) back into equilibrium and ""solves"" the dilemma . . .the anxiety."
4,Fun bizarre pulp sci-fi,"Not as elegant, twisted, and imaginative as The Dying Earth, but still very good. I warn you that the 4 book series meanders a bit and loses some energy in the latter half, but remains worthwhile throughout."
4,Wonderful insight into the 'real' world of nursing homes,"My mother went into a nursing home a little over a year ago. It is a 'good' nursing home, yet even so I have been distributed by several things related to her care (or lack thereof). The author gave a realistic picture of daily life in a nursing home from the perspective of someone who works there. I found his book to be very helpful in clarifying my own thinking about the nursing home. I recommend this to anyone who has a loved one in, or about to go into, a nursing home."
5,Perfect for those of us who don't like old-fashioned throws.,"This book is very easy to understand, the directions are written clearly and the photographs of the afghans themselves are absolutely beautiful. It has inspired me to make all of the afghans featured in the book. I also like this book because there are some very cool afghans to crochet and I would not be embarrased to show them off to any of my friends who are still in the 22-28 yrs old range. This is a lot of fun just to look at. I would also recommend any of the other Vanna White crocheting books as well. They are all put together very well."
5,Now I Have A Callous,"""What is a callous, grandma?"" Those big hazel eyes frowned at the crusty bump on my index finger. ""A callous happens when I crochet a lot, sweetie."" Little fingers turned the pages stopping on Utter Elegance. ""This is the one you are working on now, right, Grandma?"" I nodded. ""This is going to keep me plenty warm while I watch you hit that softball into right field this season, honey."" Buy the book. Make some memories."
5,GREAT CLASSIC,MY DAUGHTER WAS THRILLED. THIS WAS HER DAD'S FAVORITE CHILDHOOD BOOK AND THIS WILL BE TREASURED BY HER FOR YEARS TO COME.
1,very VERY shoddy reprint,"simply put, this is atlus' way of making quick bucks... reprint copies of games with cult followings.good, right? not quite as atlus has done a shoddy job. First of all, some copies take forever to load. Second, don't be surprised to find plenty of dust and debris in your ""sealed"" game"
5,Altus never fails,"This game is like the mature version of persona 3 and 4 I love the dark story I am a Christian and It is a lot of religious themes in this game but that what makes it so much fun. If the MC of this game was in a persona game he would be the ultimate persona user not only does he talk to demons but he can leave them out on the battle field for how ever Long he wants. Not to mention that he himself is a Demi fiend. I advise u not play hard mode unless.... Well I want spoil it for u. GET THIS GAME, PLUS U CAN'T BEAT THE AMAZON PRICE. GOD BLESS HAVE GREAT DAY."
5,Strategy game unlike any other!,This game really loves watching you go down in tears xD it's great fun and keeps you on edge every min of the game.
5,SHIN MEGAMI TENSEI NOCTURNE,I purchased this game for my 19 year old son. He owned it before but it went missing. He loves this game.....He looked everywhere locally to purchase it but could not find a copy. He was thrilled when I ordered it online for him as a surprise.
3,Alot of potential if you have saint-like patience,"I love the SMT series Persona games but all of these games have 1 thing in common: massive grinding time. Nocturne is no exception and seems to have more grind time than any other game I've ever played. I never actually finished the game because I simply don't have enough time in my day. Nonetheless, I can see where the game has potential in its interesting plot."
3,Evil Hour - Russell Blackford,"Terminator Model--. This is the second book so I suppose it may make a bit more sense after the first, but there is a model 799.Also, some Skynet plot to suborn humans to do its will by programming. Mostly, the interesting parts of the book are when John is involved.The characters themselves have discussions about how it is very hard to cope with all this time travel stuff, and now they have superwarriors from another reality with them, and are looking to travel to others. That's a lot of fighting to do."
4,Mr. Coffee Thermal Coffeemaker,I love the ability to brew my coffee and take the thermal carafe into the living room and enjoy several half-cups of steaming coffee over an hour or so. My only negative experience is the thermal carafe is very tight and rather difficult to open and close. My first thermal carafe so don't know what else is available.
2,Do not waste your money,"If it keeps coffee warm for 'hours' - it must be a max of 2, and that is when the temp is 100 degrees! I do not know how they measure cups - but this coffee pot does NOT make 8 cups of coffee - or my measuring cup is not calibrated properly. And - heaven forbid - you do not put the pot in exactly the right spot when you turn it on (then go to take your morning shower). Upon your return, you will find such a mess all over your counter. I paid so much money for this disaster, I keep trying to learn to live with it - but think I will go back to my old coffee maker that only costs less than $20. Had to replace it every 18 months of so - but I now find that was a pleasure."
1,Can't open the carafe,"The coffee maker is fine. Cone filter basket, thermal carafe. All good items. BUT the lid on the carafe is very difficult to open. The design is such that you are supposed to insert your fingers into the groove on the top of the lid and turn. If you are a woman with FINGERNAILS, this can't happen. If you have arthritis or just weak hands, you are going to have to call for help to get this coffee out.The main flaw in the design of this pot is the lid on the carafe. If Mr. Coffee can come up with a lid that's easy to open, they'll have a great system here."
2,disappointment,"We had given up on Mr Coffee products, but this Mr Coffee promised all the functions we need in this house: auto shut-off, 2-hour thermal carafe, mid-range capacity, simple controls, all at a sensible price. We used it, delighted with our choice, for almost six weeks, when one day we found ourselves standing by the coffeemaker to re-start it again and again just to complete a single brew. It simply shut itself off before the brewing cycle was completed. After a weekend of this infuriating routine, we returned it for a full refund.Mr Coffee? Never again."
1,Disappointing...,"I was quite disappointed in this book for a couple of reasons. One, I find the instructions difficult to follow and, two, the illustrations are also difficult to follow. I will probably not even use this book. There are no color photos except on the front and back covers."
3,Eh,"I've been making jewelry for myself and friends for about two years now. I've graduated from the bead on a head pin to shaping wire on a jig. I bought this book to learn how to wrap cabochons. The author uses variations on two basic methods -- both of which aren't the easiest to master. I'm not saying that this isn't a good book, but I guess I was hoping for a jewelry-making epiphany. I'll keep looking."
3,Cookbook for Wire Wrapping Designs,"Cookbook? Well, yes, that's how its laid out. It has a few color photographs of all the projects and then pages and pages of line drawings and expanations of exactly how to do each project. If you are into wire wrapping and want lots of basic information in one place, this seems like a good book, but I found it somewhat uninspiring. I have seen so much wire wrapped work that it all looks the same and I wanted to see something classy and exciting."
5,Helpful,This book is very helpful and gives many usable ideas. I especially appreciate the detailed explanation and especially the drawings!
1,Way Overpriced!,"The price on this book is an insult! $129.99, $999.00!Go to Delphi.com and get it for $19.99!I've shopped at Amazon.com for years and never would have believed this!"
1,Dissapointing,"Sixth jewelry wrapping book I've purchased. This is by far the most outdated and poorly conceived jewelry wrapping techniques of any of the books, with few color photos. Save your money."
3,I'm not sure about this one,"I read the reviews before I ordered the book and thought that it still sounded like just the kind of book I was looking for. Then I received the book. My initial reaction was to send the book back; I even went so far as to get the return mail label, etc. from Amazon. Then I looked at the book again and thought that I could use the information from a few of the tutorials to help me come up with my own designs. After I took a good hard look at the book again I called Amazon and said that I was going to keep the book after all, there are several sections that I will find useful. I would suggest that if you are trying to do wire projects you get the book. But, be prepared to possibly return it because it's not for everyone."
3,Moods in Wire,"The layout of the book and pictures are not as good as other books I have purchased, though I do like the artist's wire wrapping designs a lot."
4,one of the first of its kind,"This book was one of the first books on wire wrapping available. Many of the later artists got started with this book, and i would suggest it just for that reason. the down side is that YES many of the designs at this point look ""dated"" because everyone has copied them!so...the down side is its dated, many of the designs look like they are from the 60's and 70's (they are) and most wire wrappers have done them to death.the plus side?strong clear instructions, including for the classic wire wrapped ring!the fact that most of the other artists started here, means that mastering these techniques will prepare you for anything else you may ever do!and while some of the designs may be a bit boring... they still sell, so if you want to sell wire wrapping you want this book.for more advanced work, that doesn't look ""artsy craftsy"" or antique i suggestWirework w/DVD: An Illustrated Guide to the Art of Wire Wrapping"
2,Very Disappointing,"This book leaves much to be desired. It is all in black and white, which makes deciphering the screen shots very difficult. The problem is worsened by poor quality graphics. When the author says to click on certain icons or buttons, it is almost impossible to see what he means.I've read many computer how-to books and this one was by far the hardest to follow."
2,Not what you think.,"The title of this DVD is a bit misleading. I thought it would explain certain things about becoming a gay man, however its more into telling you about sexually transmitted diseases and then hammers mostly on HIV / Aids.The only reason to really get this DVD is if you want to see naked men having sex and listen to real people telling you how they have safe sex and how they experienced it.This is more a documentary rather than a movie, so steer clear if you expect to actually learn something about becoming a man."
3,WELL DONE INFORMATIVE,I THOUGHT THIS DOCUMENTARY WAS A WAKE UP CALL FOR EVERYONE TO PRACTICE SAFE SEX AND BE RESPONSIBLE IN HELPING REDUCE THE SPREAD OF AIDS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO DO NOT REMEMBER THE NUMBERS IT HAS ALREADY KILLED.
2,Is this for Grade School People?,"I thought this might be a great instructional and interesting video presentation, but the message delivered was aimed at grade school mentality. If you're old enough to buy it, you already know it and will be bored by the mindless chatter."
1,Inaccurate to the Point of Uselessness,"Perhaps I just got a bad one, but it always read significantly (50 to 75 degrees) lower than my oven indicated. Over time it's gotten even worse and is now useless. Spend a couple of dollars more and get something decent."
1,Dead on arrival,"I tried placing this thermometer in different places in my oven, but the temperature gauge never moved. Amazon made it simple to return at their expense, but I decided not to bother with a replacement. I'll just pick something up locally."
2,Cook Rite 90300 Oven Thermometer,"This is a tool every cook needs to accurately monitor and set the oven right for the desired results every time. I do have onegripe about this product though; because of it's small size, the numbers get harder to read as it ages and the burnt onspatters begin to obscure the glass from the edges in."
1,Stopped working,"Thermometer worked great for about two weeks, then the needle suddenly refused to budge from zero. The dial face was easy to read, and the hanging clip nice, if only the temperature worked!"
1,Turned Black and is Unreadable,After a bit the face of the thermometer turned black and could not be cleaned. It's unreadable and therefore unusable. Would not purchase again.
3,product quality,Thermometer worked functional well but when I moved the unit in the oven from the rack. BTW - it was hanging. The top hanger broke off at the spot welds that attach the hook. Guess I will have to have it repaired.
1,Not always accurate,"Try to find a better one. My oven takes about 8 to 10 minutes to reach 400 this thermometer takes 15-20 minutes to reach 350 it shows my oven is not hot enough even though food is burning, so I know it is not accurate. I have never seen a thermometer take so long to register a temperature. Its also a pain cause it doesn't stand up without constantly falling over, & hanging it always falls off the hook with little vibration."
5,Oven calibration proven Right On!,"Sunbeam, 90300, Oven Thermometer, Stainless SteelBelieving two thermometers are necessary to verify the calibration of our oven, I purchased this Sunbeam model together with the Taylor Oven Guide Thermometer. Both read within two degrees of each other and the oven itself was right on the money!"
1,Inaccurate Thermometer,"I needed to get a second thermometer because I had a feeling the one in my oven was a bit off and many people recommend two for accuracy. Well, this on was WAY off. I got a THIRD to confirm it. I can have the over set at 400 and both the others are more or less the same. This one consistently shows over 500 degrees for anything over 350. Waste of money."
1,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would.","I put it in the oven, set at 350 degrees, for a long time (about an hour). During that time, the indicator never wavered -- it stayed at the same 500 degrees it was at when I took it out of the package.This is a piece of junk."
1,Junk - rarely works and is inaccurate when it does.,"I have a reasonably new. two-year old oven and wanted an oven thermometer to double check things. My girlfriend got this one for me and it doesn't work. Sometimes when the oven isn't even on the temperature is stuck at 500 degrees other times it is all the way down at 200. The needle doesn't ever seem to move in any predictable pattern. Sometimes it stays stuck wherever it is and other times it is within about 100 degrees of my oven temperature. I've given up on this thing being usable and don't advise anyone else buy one.Buy it if you have money to waste.Don't buy it if...ok, just don't buy it."
5,Best pirate RPG of all time.,One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve. Thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen. Nuf said.
2,Torgoen T06,"Pros: This is a fairly large and heavy watch. It feels solid and is nice looking. The slide rule scales are small, but can be read without magnification.Cons: This watch has several really annoying features that I think everyone should know. The minute had is so long that it extends past the minute index marks and it is so wide that it spans two minutes at any time. It is impossible to see prcisely what time it is because of this.The bracelet has only one extra set of micro adjustment holes on the deployment, so it is hard to get it to fit correctly. There are no half size links in the bracelet. You can only size it by removing full links. It is either too loose or too snug.The bracelet does not have a saftey catch on the deployment.The second hand does not align with the index marks. This is mostly a cosmetic problem, but I think it is an indication of the overall quality."
5,Not available in Canada anymore,"Apparently AIWA does not deal in Canada anymore.Now I'm having a hell of a hard time trying to get some in Montreal. AIWA do not ship to Canda with their web site orders and now, Amazon is saying that shipping is not available in Canada for this item. I'm going mad over here, losing my mind trying to get them. I don't know how I'm going to ever purchase them ever again! And I have 3 to order for friends!!These are the best in-ear earphones The rubber seal cuts out exterior sound and bass reproduction is unequaled. I dare you to find in-ear earphones with better frequency responses. Really. I looked."
1,Absolutely unacceptable sound... Waste of Money,"I bought these headphones...hopping that I will get something that I will blow my head off. I was totally unsatisfied. These headphones create an environment as if you are in a car driving at 100 miles per hour with the windows open! I think AIWA was aiming to create headphones to immitate the sound of car stereos. They succeded for a 100 mile/hour car!Now to get serious, this product is a complete waste of money-and they were not cheap. There is zero bass boost, TOO MUCH MIDDLE FREQUENCIES, and very little treble. If you find divices with the abillity to handle middle frequencies, you might get something out of them. The sound is really flat as it is...My strong recommendation to you: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Thust me, I am a musician and I want the best sound when it comes to listening to my own music or other CDs...Be wise and look elsewhere..."
2,Booty Camp,"No so good. It has alot of background noise like the wind blowing. Goes too fast from one exercise to another, not enough time to get in position. I'll be selling it on Ebay."
2,Meh... Over rated,I bought this a while ago and was not satisfied so I returned it. Nikki is very peppy and always has a smile on her face though she moves and transitions too quickly and does not explain her movement well enough. Half the time the shots don't show where her foot placement is (this is dangerous because if you position your knees/ankles incorrectly you can cause a lot of strain and damage).Seems a bit low quality- though I have nothing to compare it to.On the actual exercise end- some of the moves are great though these moves are the classical ones you can also find on youtube or the internet in general. I was hoping that she would bring something new to the table.
3,Could Have Been Amazing,"I've been waiting for this DVD ever since the film was screened in limited release a few years back. Finally! So I eagerly opened the box and popped the DVD in. I was expecting much much more extra elements. Sure we have the two movies - the Japanese version being the prize - and a few other features. But, for such a groundbreaking and controversial film, precious little is on this DVD. For a film that spawned countless sequels and even more cultural references - not to mention a very active nuclear debate that still rages today - this release does not deliver the goods.Besides this, I sat enthralled watching one of my most favorite films! Godzilla/Gorjira is a horror thrill!"
2,Still a very bad movie,"The original version may be better then the Americanized version I saw as a child, but it is still a bad movie. If you are a hugh Godzilla fan you will want this DVD, but otherwise you will be disapointed.The bad science is fun, though:Dinosaurs and trilobites roamed the earth 2 million years ago during the Jurassic period.Oxygen is split into two fluids to create the oxygen destroyer."
5,Great Addition,My grandson thinks this is a great addition to his collection of Godzilla Movies. He has fun showing it in Japanese (with the subtitles). I think its interesting to see this now versus the technology of today.
3,would be 5 stars if encoding wasn't poor,"What a shame to wait so long, get such an exceptionally fine packaging job and a fair price, and extras - and they blow the encoding. What in the world? I haven't seen a disk encoded this poorly on any dvd costing more than $1. What happenned?Is it the film itself, moving in the gate? What this encoding suffers from is the shimmer of high contrast areas; highlights of objects move out of sync with the rest of the object. It appears to have been digtized with a $40 over the counter adapter?!"
5,A masterpiece revealed,"I highly recommend this set for all Godzilla fans, especially if you like old monster movies. It has the english and japanese versions of this film. Personally, I think the japanese version is the best, because it doesn't have any narration. Plus, you feel like you're part of the story. The english version is good too, I'd say they are about even. The thing I like about the japanese versions of Godzilla films, is that it's easier to understand what's going on. Of course, you would have to be willing to read subtitles. This is a must-have for any fan looking for both versions of the Godzilla films."
4,classic show,This is certainly the true Godzilla with no fluff....back to the old days. We loved watching it.
4,Godzilla [Gojira],"Definitely a throw back to 1950s' Sci-Fi, well done. The original film far surpasses the version where Raymond Burr's voice was added as narrator."
5,A Kid's Review,"Besides Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope, this is the best film out there ! This DVD set has 2 discs, one is Gojira (1954) and the other is the American version Godzilla: King of the Monsters (1956).Japanese version review:This is best movie ever ! An atomic monster, a scientist, helpless people, destroyed buildings, death, you name it ! So the story goes like this...... the Japanese test their new fancy pancy atomic bomb. It wakes up Godzilla and gives him radioactive powers. He comes to Tokyo and destroys everything TWICE ! What happens then? Buy it to see ! Great Movie !American version review:Yes, their are changes to this version. Most of the scenes were deleted. Especially with the scientist (I forgot his name). So this isn't the best version. Itis still a awesome movie."
4,Great thorough discussion,Erin is an excellent writer and this book was a great addition to her other writings. She explained the retrograde planets in a way that finally made sense to me.
3,leaves me wanting another deliverance,"All I can say is after listening to this with high expectations,ultimately it sort of left me flat. Its sad to say because I have been a fan of COC for quite some time,and although I appreciate that they picked up the pace from the southern fried Volume Dealer,it still is sort of,well,uninspired. Maybe its the VERY noticable absence of drummer Reed Mullin,or the fact that when compared to classics like Deliverance,this new effort just falls short. Its still much better than many of the new bands [...] thats getting recycled nowadays,but for a rabid fan of COC like myself,thats still sub par.Stone Breaker starts things off with a bang,but then things begin to taper off. Maybe it will grow on me the more I listen to it."
3,It is Not Delieverance.,"I admit i jumped on the COC bandwagon late, not geting into them until Blind and Deliverance.I love those two CDs.Wiseblood is pretty good as well.In the Arms of God is not bad, and i think i need to hear it a few more times.But it lacks some of the power and conviction IMO of those earlier standouts.I think I will stick to those Down Cds instead if i want to hear this style of music...."
2,ummmm........yeah,wow....what to say. Loved em since blind. lost interest after wiseblood. I saw this and bought it onna whim. I think I like a total of 4 tracks. thats 1/3 of the album. maybe im just gettin old or maybe im tired of c.o.c. i dont know.
5,Best Album of Their Career,"Corrosion of Conformity has unleashed a monstrous recording with ""In the Arms of God."" While gradually losing interest with the hard rock/metal genre (due to the multitude of ridiculous sounding bands), COC has single-handedly revived the energy that makes this music so great. Pepper Keenan has one of the most raw, fierce yet intelligent approach to writing/composing music, which I enjoy. Stanton Moore of the jazz/funk band, Galactic, might seem to be out of his league stepping into the studio with COC, but does a great job on percussion.Highlights on the album include the opener, ""Stone Breaker"" , ""In the Arms of God"" and ""Dirty Hands/Empty Pockets."" This album has the most ferocious sound that I have heard in a while and I expect nothing less from these guys."
3,dissappointed......,I was really hoping this album would be good. But i am very disappointed. All the other coc that had pepper singing were awesome.
2,The worst COC to date,This album is awful. I've got everything they've ever put out including an old cassette of 6 songs w/Mike I picked up in the 80's.I don't know what they were thinking when they recorded this album.Save your money & purchase something else.
5,GREATNESS!!,"Don't expect this to be the ""run of the mill"" release. While it is in fact the great C.O.C, there is definitely more atmosphere to this release. It only took me the first spin to feel whats goin on on this disc. Stanton Moore is a great addition to the band with his style of drumming. The production is stunning. Its nice to hear drums sound like drums again, and I have always been a big fan of the bluesiness the band brings forth while still keepin the almighty metallic riff to slam to.Mike Dean is really shining on this one in my opinion, thru his groovin basslines, as he shows some blues and jazz influence as well.As far as Woody and Pepper go.....well, you know its them with their metallic bluesiness, and raw sound.I have been a C.O.C fan for quite some time now, and while I have enjoyed every release, for the longest time, Deliverance couldnt be beat in my opinion.......I was wrong....BUY THIS CD!!!"
3,"Not bad, but not their best","I keep reading that this album is a monster of an album and an instant classic, but I must disagree. While I feel there are strong songs, overall the production is a little stale and many of the songs lose my attention. I was really looking forward to this. Maybe it needs to grow on me, like AVD did, but it has not done it so far.The only ""classic"" track I have heard thus far is Never Turns to More. That song is not only classic COC, but simply classic. Great tune. AVD got beat up because it was a diversion. I would not say it was that much of a diversion, I just felt it was more classic Southern rock than any of their previous, but they were headed in that direction anyway.Their best remains Wiseblood. Raw, heavy, catchy and plain ol' fun. I would compare ITAOG most to Deliverance. Not a bad album, but not a classic."
5,How mean people get the upper hand,"Don't read this in order to use it yourself, read it so you will recognize what others are using on you. You'll learn to see the power plays and often be able to foil them before they're fully developed - after they are firmly in place, you're already just another victim."
4,Power! misunderstood,"This book was originally written/intended as a satire on climbing the corporate ladder and the power-lust so many of us are privy to in the professional world. If you think the advice is heavy-handed and off-target, well, it's supposed to be!"
1,not good,"This wasn't well, written, nor very insightful. Korda in his own memoir dismisses it as kind of a joke of a book that mistakenly got taken seriously."
1,Wrong handle,"The handle doesn't fit any of the power units we have, too bad. I hope to get a power unit some where."
2,Misrepresentation - BRAUN 7040-091 two speed power handle,"Look carefully at product. It is not the same product that you will receive. If you have the charger...and think you will not need a new charger....you're mistaken. They don't tell you that it is not the same toothbrush pictured, and you will need the charger too. How does Amazon let independent sellers misrepresent their product? I can't use what they sent because the charger I have doesn't fit, but, it would have, if they sent me the exact toothbrush pictured.....very upsetting."
5,braun 3d brush,i charged it after receiving it and am still brushing on that same charge .. i guess my dad's goes for 3 weeks .. it must be niMH or maybe lithium batttery .. its way better than ni cad whatever it is !u have to be carefull with these -- no showering and toothbrushing multi tasking -- this will let water get in (as you will drop in the shower on accident) and it will corrode from within .. thats how my old one died ...i bought a dollar store one and it is a joke compared to this one ...
5,Great replacement,This works better than I remember the original working. Original was old enough for the battery to lose it's power. Much cheaper than buying a whole new unit.
5,Just what I wanted,"The Power Handle on my corrent toothbrush wasn't fully charging any more. I was a little confused about how to choose the correct one, but this one was a perfect fit. And now that I have a new one, I know how bad my old one was getting! I'm very happy."
4,Good Value,"Good item, replaced my old brush for 25 bucks. Saved me from buying the whole set. Shipping is overpiced and deadfully slow."
5,Excellent tooth brush handle,This was a replacement brush handle for one that was 5 years old and still running. The Oral B handle is excellent for good dental care and it is reliable.
5,ideal,I liked this watch so much I bought several more from the same series and gave them to friends in my role play group. It's sturdy and keeps great time which I wasn't expecting from a watch so cheap. The covered watch face makes it ideal for those who love to work with their hands and who may scratch tradtional type watches.
1,Eaten in less then 1 day,"My dog, left standing next to me while I talked to a neighbor, chewed clean through this leash... in less than 10 minutes flat. We then knotted it back together to get him home. As I said good-bye, he chewed another clean line through this leash but this time in less than 5 minutes. I'm going to try to get my money back. This leash lasted less then 2 walks total."
4,"Good leash, love the hitch! Wish the strap was thicker.","Good leash, love the hitch! Wish the strap was thicker. We have an older one (I believe by Petmate) and the strap on it is much thicker and easier to use. However, this was the only one we found currently being produced and is quite handy to strap them to a park bench or to you belt while you pick up after them or let the kids play at the park."
4,Hitch leash,I like this leash very much for the price. I wish it was a little more durable for use with a puppy!
4,Just As Expected,"Having been called to service to bandage some slow healing wounds on my brothers lower legs, I needed smaller gloves than what was on hand. These fit just fine and I felt comfortable in taking care of his wounds. They are healing very nicely, thank you!"
4,A Good Book to Start thinking about the importance of the Physical World,"Ray Bakke gives a good starting point for Christians to think about the importance of our love for the city. There is often a mistaken sentiment among Christians that the City and its people are sinful and depraved, that Christians need to be separated from them. God loves the Cities and the people in them. God cares for human civilization, so should we."
3,clarification: straight fish oil,"I got the wrong idea after reading other reviews. This is straight-up fish oil, not molecularly distilled; the label makes no mention of testing for mercury or such. Omega-3 Enteric Coated 1000mg 90 Softgels, for example does.Also, it lists 300mg of Omega-3 fatty acids per capsule, but does not list the mix of DHA v. EPA v. other Omega-3 fatty acids. Not exactly a critical issue, but it makes me think that the mix may vary over time, depending upon what fish is cheapest... I prefer a consistent supplement."
4,Lawn Buddy,"I didn't order this item for myself, but as a silent auction offering at a church fundraiser. When I had received it and looked it over, I would have ordered it for myself if I was in the market for one. It is well built and has an excellent storage bin for your small tools. The seller delivered as advertised. I would buy from this seller again. Amazon has always been a trusted source and reference over the years."
4,Bigger than I thought (i like it!),This item seems to be built well and has ample storage for all my gardening trinkets. I received it relatively quickly and did not need to assemble it.
5,Good durability,"I have owned this for 5 or 6 years now. I keep it outdoors in the garden so that my tools are close by. It has endured hot days, rain, and freezes, and still does the job. I don't use it for sitting as much as I thought I would, only because I don't bother to sit down in the garden, but it is a great portable tool chest, protecting what's inside and keeping it handy."
3,I own 8 of them..all now broken.,"I own 8 of them! I think it is a fabulous cart until the little stubs break that insert into the lid from the body. Every single cart has broken both of these stubs...then you keep sinking into the cart with the lid. If I could see an improvement by using something other than plastic in that area I think it would be better. I have decided to try some other type of cart. Forty dollars a pop is getting too costly to keep it replaced.I have never had one of the wheels or axles break. Storage is pretty good and I for one use the insert tray for plant tags, markers, identifier ribbons, etc., and plant ties and really small tools for working inside flower pots. I think the little clip things on the sides to hold tools is too flimsy if it gets caught on anything. I have had at least 6 of my carts to have those break as well. Even with all my problems...I still really like it's design...I just feel in needs to be sturdier."
2,Not well made,Workmanship is marginal. The insert was warped and doesn't fit in the space provided. I wrote the manufacturer to inquire about a replacement but did not receive a response.
1,Back wheels and axel were broken off.,"All of the plastic parts that hold the back axel and two wheels on were broken (I think there were four). It was snug in the Amazon box, but I think it must have been poor quality plastic in order to break just by placing it in the box. The broken plastic pieces were in the box. I really doubt that plastic could have withstood being used out in the garden with an adult scooting on it. I hate returning items but this was beyond use."
3,not sturdy enough,"I purchased this scooter last May. It was exactly what I wanted. It lasted only 1 1/2 seasons,however! The seat collapsed into the box, the thin plastic rings holding the seat axle broke right away and the box split right down to the bottom. I think the blazing sun here in the south softened the plastic so when I returned to the garden after a cool-down period, then sat on the seat, it slowly sank. I admit that I gave it a good workout hauling 5 gallon containers of sod and scooting along in my 60x30 veggie garden. I do think I will buy another one and attempt to reinforce the seat and plastic rings before using it this time. This is the only scooter that had all the features that I was looking for so I really do not have a choice. With spinal arthritis, I simply cannot bend and I am not willing to give up my gardening!"
2,Handle fell off after one season.,"This is a handy cart, and we used it a lot for about a year before the plastic gave out and the handle fell off. If you're going to use it lightly or don't expect it to last it will be fine."
3,Arrived Damaged Twice,"I ordered this cart as a gift. It arrived quickly, but was damaged (a corner was broken off of an interior, non-functional piece). I contacted the seller and they promptly sent me a new cart free of charge. This second cart also arrived damaged (this time on of four plastic coverings for one of the wheel axels was broken off). Neither cart was functionally damaged, though I imagine that with repeated use the cart with the axel holder break could lose the axel entirely. I decided spare the hassle of ordering another cart, and gifted the cart as planned. I did not try it in the garden setting, but did sit and roll on it in the house and it felt sturdy. The carts were packed tightly in the boxes they were shipped in so it's possible the damage could have been due to shipping, but it seemed more likely that it was due to poor quality plastic."
5,Lawn Buddy,"The lawn buddy is great for weeding along flower beds and planting flowers, I sit and roll! I have a large yard, so the storage is convenient for small gardening tools and its great to have a handle to pull it from one area to the next."
5,Exactly Right!,"Bought this as a gift for mom. She loves it! No more bending down and kneeling to garden in her flower beds. She reports that this garden accessory on wheels is sturdy and comfortable. She was thrilled with the tool kit that fits inside for her gloves, spade and flowers. She is enjoying her garden again."
2,too small,"I thought his would work well, but found it too small for my needs. It is however very sturdy."
2,Comes in pieces and shipped with no batteries. My son's birthday surprise and did not work.,The front attaches separately and there are NO BATTERIES when shipped. The CR123 battery was eleven dollars at CVS. The unit did not work and I was of course disappointed. I sent it back.
3,Not for 3 yr old,"I have a 4 yr old and 3 yr old who opened this from Santa and after less than 5 minutes of playing with it - managed to break off the trunk - which then kept happening. Also my girls wanted to hold the trunk as it was moving and that caused it to make a ticking sound like it was going to break. So while this is such a cute toy and looked great on the commerical (it doesn't move as smoothly as shown on tv), its for a little bit older of a child."
4,Sweet toy for 5 yr. olds,"My daughter loves this toy. The elephant is cute and will pick up the little dolls with no problem if you practice a bit with the template. My 2 year old grabbed it...and no doubt the elephant trunk will come off. I suggest buying it for an adept 4 year-old or 5 and up. Tika has glitter on the exterior, which scored points for my daughter and she loves playing with the little princesses along with her Island Princess doll.Mattel Barbie As The Island Princess Princess Rosella Doll"
2,Don't buy it to learn about Huntington's Disease,This is a young readers' book about growing up and finding oneself. Huntington's is only a side issue. The prose is often stilted and the characters one dimensional. The whole issue of heredity is confusing. Bent's mother has Huntington's and she is a second cousin to Bent's father. There is no known history of Huntington's in the family. The writer makes the statement that no one knows how the gene is transmitted. Simply not true. It has long been known that the gene is dominant and offspring have a 50% change of inheriting the disease. What was the author's point in making the parent's second cousins in a book supposedly about a hereditary disease?
4,Good stuff,"Recently i got this book read within 2 days. It gives few detective stories solved by the writer himself.It also tells abt russian old judicial system.(people courts)Though the stories take place early 20th century, they are bit different from usual stuff, each story is diff in its own way.Just remember they have really happened!!!!The last story was really good , had some good twists & turns. I reccommend this book for all crime story lovers....I looked for some more writings from this authour - i can't find - can anyone help me?"
1,doesn't make sense,"This wasn't a bad idea....but the statistics created are fantasy statistics that clearly do no resemble how players of yesteryear would have done today or even the value of what those players would have produced today. Since the numbers are simply too bizarre to take seriously, the book ends up dull and unengaging."
1,Where's the bass?,"These headphones look great and the Swoops Neckband makes it comfortable to wear but unfortunately they do not sound as good as they look. They are lacking in bass. If you go to the AIWA site to see the features, you will read that AIWA has incorporated the ""Acoustic Plus Technology"" and the ""Pipe-Phone for Super Bass,"" designed to increase bass reponse. I had to turn up the bass on my portable Sony CD player (D-EJ815) all the way up and even still, it did not sound as deep and powerful as the ones that came with my portable CD player."
3,So-so book. Get Suze Orman's instead.,"I bought this book andThe Money Book for the Young, Fabulous & Broke. Skip this one and get Suze Orman's book instead. Both books are for people in their 20's or 30's, but Suze Orman's book covers much more material and many more options. The Idiot's Guide tells the same old story: budget, budget, budget, and is very light on details."
4,Basic Guide a Good Start for the Young Adult,"Like all ""Idiot"" books I have read, this one has excellent organization. Technical jargon is kept to a minimum, and the conversational writing style moves along at a good pace. The level of user-friendliness makes the information instantly accessible and useful to young people who are concerned about their financial futures. The strategies are indeed suited to the age group in the title - 20s and 30s - because the strategies outlined are quite conservative. These will have limited use for people in their 40s or 50s who have suffered a devastating financial loss (such as foreclosure and bankruptcy)and are having to start over building for retirement. This book is just what it says. It provides a wealth of simple but crucial information, all for about the price of a movie ticket, with extra large popcorn and soda. Thumbs up!"
2,Too juvenile,"I found this to be ridiculously juvenile. I skipped the first ten or so chapters because it provided absolutely no information that any person over the age of ten should know. I did however find the chapters on stock and mutual funds, etc to be very helpful. Not for someone over the age of fourteen."
4,Great starting point,Great for anyone who has to try to navigate the world of benefits and finance in this crazy world...buy it before you lose anymore money.
3,not useful for a college student,"I am still in college (and after that will be in grad school) and was looking for a book that would cover things like ""becoming financially independent from one's parents while still in school"", but this book assumed that the reader was out of college and in the work force."
5,Great Book Excellent Transaction,This seller is fabulous and items are as promised and delivered lightning quick.
5,Great CF Card,But next time I will order from B&H Photo-Shipping was slow from Adorama-I thought I was buying from Amazon--and cost saving compared with B&H was less of a diffrence after waiting for severals days to ship!Took about 10 days to get the CF card.
5,Fast even at Hi rez,"Card performs as expected, writing 10 MPix at 3-5MB/ea to card while shooting at high capture rate. I would buy this item again, would upgrade to 4MB if I was unable to download regularly. Card was reasonably priced through Amazon.Card used primarily in Canon EOS Rebel XTi."
5,It solved a lot of problems I was having with the old memory of my camera,"When I installed this memory card in my camera all the problems of speed when taking the pictures, quality of the pictures and amount of pictures inside the memory where absolutely solved, thanks to the Lexar Flash Card and new technology. I recommend this product to all the owners of digital cameras compatibles."
1,Opposite reaction,My feelings on these particular support hose are exactly opposite of what the reviews here say. They are VERY uncomfortable. I hate them. It takes forever and all my might to get them on (and off for that matter) I hate how thick they are. I feel so ugly in them. It is almost worth all the pain of my vericose veins not to wear them. My last pregnancy I found some compression hose that were so comfortable (and inexpensive). I don't know what I did with them and the store I bought them at no longer carry support hose. I wish I could remember the brand. they were great and did the job. I'm still looking for something like that!
4,great product,"This is my 3rd pair of this brand. New packaging and the color of beige is darker, which I like. I stand all day at my job. I wore these to reduce spider veins but noticed they make my legs feel better. My legs are not as tired and achy after work. They also help keep my ankles from swelling. After wearing for 8 to 12 hours, you can't wait to take them off. Good, sturdy product! Laundry correctly and they will last for years!"
3,"Not very comfortable ,",I like this brand very much. Have many pairs of the med suppport and light support love the fact I can wash them in the machine. The firm support doesn't look very natural and is made differently probably good if you have a lot of varicosities.
5,Great support hose!,"I have to wear firm support hose because of my varicose veins. I have tried other brands, but these are absolutely the best! They are relatively easy to get on and provide good graduated support. The only problem I've had is finding them. I'm so glad Amazon is carrying them and at a great price, too. If you need support hose, I would highly recommend this brand."
4,pleased,"I am 5ft2, weigh 120 lbs and have long legs. Medium is a good fit. The stockings are rather heavy, but not expensive."
2,wrong items,"the pantyhose were NOT beige nor firm, but were nude and not as firm as expected. Did not return them the wife was in dire need of them.Thank you for your help in this mattersincerly gerald Pushard"
5,RFID Sourcebook - Great Resource,"This book is a great resource as it covers RFID from the many perspectives anyone considering the technology needs to consider. It is well organized and easy to read cover to cover or by topic. It continuously reinforces three of the most basic ideas a project manager needs for a successful RFID pilot or roll out. First, understand the current state of the technology and manage the stakeholder's objectives so that they are not oversold. Second, learn now and pilot if you can, so that you are ready when the myriads of standards referenced in the text coalesce making RFID system integration easier. And third, use the tools provided to look into the the long term benefits of the technology so you are prepared for RFID requirements from your customers as this technology will become as pervasive as barcodes in the not so distant future."
5,Good analytical view of RFID line of business,"Sandip has been one of the good experts in RFID area and I believe anyone entering in this space must read this book.This book explains basics of RFID from both technical and business perspective. Once you plan to implement RFID in your organization, the project management section helps you to plan for the pilot and then implementation.This book is a great companion for RFID consultants and end users alike.Hoping to see a sequel to this book."
1,Weak,"A very slow unimaginative effort. Uses incidents and well-known quotes, people and transposes them into his work e.g. Dorie Miller's story is simply retold using a man named chiorboy. Unlikely incidents, poorly developed charachers are thrown together. With 2 weeks trainig the hero becomes a TDC officer. Civilians enjoy cocktails and dinner with Admiral Kimmel the day after Pearl Harbor- I don't think so. Save your money or read Away All Boats."
2,Disappointing,"The book is billed as a submarine story, but unfortunately, less than a third of the novel actually takes place onboard submarines. Instead, Vaughan tries to cover the entire war in less than three hundred pages, leaving a very thin read. The material that is present is subpar, the author describing three hours of depth charging in a single sentence. Read _Das Boot_ if you want a real submarine novel.The Christian angle of the book is also unexpected and detracts greatly from the story. There is, literally, more material written about church and faith than there is about submarines. Several times there are acts of divine intervention that take away any notion of seriousness the book might have had.If you want a religious fantasy set in the period 1941-1945, this might be the book for you. If you want a real war novel, stay away."
1,Don't Buy this,As you probably know Microsoft has discontinued their HD output package for the original XBox. All the stores are sold out. So I went on the internet to go find the Microsoft product. I got this in the mail and sure enough it wasn't by microsoft even though it was advertised as Microsoft. Well I gave it a shot anyway and plugged it in. The picture was good but NO SOUND via the optical output. Thus no Dolby Digital. I am now trying to return it since it does not work properly and the seller is being a pain. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!! Most likely I will eat the shipping and handling costs and will have to file a claim with Amazon due to a bad seller.
2,Tea for Two,"The tea you actually get from Amazon only contains 20 tea bags, not 24. When I contacted Amazon to let them know this, they sent me another box in exchange. Well, they just sent me the exact same box of tea! The box doesn't even look like the one on their website.As for the tea itself, it doesn't have the best flavor, not the worst either. It is drinkable though. It didn't do much for me in increasing milk production. I have read that taking fenugreek supplements on their own work better. I bought some from GNC."
1,ANGEL BABY EARTH MOMMA IS SO MUCH BETTER,"This product really has not helped me at all. I first tried Earth Momma Angel Baby, it was wonderful. Thenthis,because I found it cheaper than Angel Baby, but it was a mistake. Has not increased milk production at all, and it taste bad. The Earth Momma Angel Baby tastes great, even without sweetener. Try this instead,Earth Mama Angel Baby Organic Milkmaid Tea, 16 Teabags/Box (Pack of 3)i promise its better."
5,Great results so far!,"This is my second child and with both babies I have had trouble pumping enough at work to send to daycare and need to supplmement with formula. I just started this tea yesterday with 2 cups and today 1 cup so far. For about a month I have been consistently pumping a little less than 8 ounces over 2 pumping sessions at work, but today I pumped a little over 10 ounces, pumping the same amount of time! Just those two extra ounces is huge for me. As others mentioned I am also a regular tea drinker so its not the extra fluid intake. I like the taste, but it has anise in it which some might not like. Hope this tea keeps my supply up!"
1,Amount Was Not as Described,"When I placed the order, the description said it came as 20 plates per package. I placed an order of 3, but I only received 3 plates when I expected 60. I didn't realize that until I went back to review the original product description."
4,Not bad.,"Maunder's text may not be the ""best"" book on algebraic topology, but I still recommend this one to those who find other more advanced texts like Spanier rather inaccessible. Warning: the chapter on cohomology and duality is not very well-organaized (compared to other chapters), so you may want to consult Bredon's book instead."
3,Shouldn't be your first text in algebraic topology.,"It is a decent book in algebraic topology, as a reference. At first, I found this textbook rather hard to read. Too many lemmas, theorems, etceteras. Three suggestions:1. Needs more pictures, especially for the simplicial homology Chapter.2. CW complexes should be covered before duality and not after.3. Needs more examples and exercises.Overall, the book is very good, if you have already some experience in Algebraic Topology. I found that the Croom's book ""Basic concepts of Algebraic Topology"" is an excellent first textbook. Too bad it is out of print, since it is very popular, every time I get it from the library, someone else recalls it. The combination of these two books probably is the right thing to have: Maunder's book picks up where Croom has left you."
3,Not for taller women,"This product would get five stars if it were longer. My wife is 5'9"" and it is barely past her lower back."
4,good,"everything that francesca jourdan said about this book is true, it does have alot of info. the only thing i did not like about this book is that it is written is school book form. it is hard to get into this book, but once you do you find out it is very informative."
1,Pricey in light of quality,"Although this compilation of tools is appropriate for the job, the overall quality is Walmart style at best. Screwdrivers are cheap plastic handled garbage, and the rest are the type you find at Home Depot in the 99 cent bins. Since receiving it, I have since replaced almost everything with my own tools. The case is a nice size to carry it all but made out of cheap plastic which I expect to fail in a short time. Overall, total crap at an inflated price. Buy your own stuff and stick it in a high quality leather case which is what you should have got for this price. Use cables to go for cables, not tools."
4,They work for me....,"This is my second Field Service tools set from Cables to Go. My first set I had for over a year almost two with no problems, but quit that job and had to return them. If I could have kept them I would still be using that set. I like the fact all the tools I need are there. I was in Field Support now I do Hardware support so not in the field anymore. So I don't use my tools everyday. The storage in the case is really limited. If you need addtional smaller tools and/or cabling tools you should be okay if you take out the soidering stuff. There is no room for bluky items it make the case harder to close. If you work on printers or repairs on a daily basis you might not like the set. The screw drivers are fine to take out but I stuggle with the plyers and bigger items. Do I need the Field Service tool set not really. Would I recommend the set if you do 7+ sites a day maybe not. That's why I like this tool kit. It has everything I need to do my job. It works for me..."
2,Not worth the money,"The tools included is kind of flimsy low quality, not worth the price. The multi-meter is also cheap, and looks not reliable. The wrenches is too small and not handy at all."
2,Not worth the money!,"I got the items and to my dismay, two of the items broke as they were taken from the box, Not worth the money!"
5,A great source of information.,"This video, Dave presents the topic of sound and mixing. What a concept. He goes through tuning, mic's and placement, and mixing. This has been a great source of information being that I'm in the process of recording my next CD. When you watch this video, you get the feeling you are in the same room with him. In other words, it's not produced to the point that it feels like he's reading a script, or he had to do a lot of takes to get it right. It feels natural. The information here is so valuable and stress the fact that drummers need to know there instrument and understand the sound and not just how to play it. I recommend this one and the 1st two in this 3 tape series."
3,"High camp, disgusting, but very special","Filled with sickly unerotic sex of many varieties (girl/girl incest, girl/guy, girl/girl/guy, and solo sex with sonic corn cobs), this film should be too disgusting to watch.But it's not. Well, not if you're drinking, anyways.The black kleptomaniacal 'fairy' godmother (played to the hilt by Sy Richardson), the naive and *very* blonde Cinderella (played by the late Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith), and the comically stoic Lord Chamberlain (Kirk Scott) all make this film a hoot.And the two songs...the driving disco duet between Cinderella and her Fairy Godmother ""Stick it to the Man"", and the hilarious angst-filled song sung by the bored, oversexed Prince ""My Kingdom Won't Come"" also help to not only make this movie worth seeing (at least for folks who like campy movies and can stand the terrible and completely unappealing sex scenes), but worth buying on DVD as well."
3,Review of American Wives,"Well-crafted stories, particularly the title story, ""American Wives"", but occasionally smacks of overt symbolism and tries, too hard, to stylize Alice Munro."
2,"good writing, low on emotion","I liked the use of language in this book. I didn't find the stories emotionally moving, though."
1,Not worth the money,"If you are preparing for the developer exam this is not the book to buy. I just took the exam and out of 25 chapters in the book, I would say that it references maybe half of them. The sample questions are very misleading also. In fact that is my biggest complaint. They are extremely easy, but when you take the test your mouth will just hang. The first thing in your head will be ""This isn't anything like what I was encouraged to study."" I would compare it to asking someone to add 2+2=4 and then saying okay now on the test due physics word problems(and I took and passed quantum mechanics in college). If you want to pass the exam you need to learn all the obscure things that never get used in flash and I mean everything.As far as for learning flash, this book isn't worth the paper it was printed on. That doesn't bother me though because it was meant to be a study guide for the exam. It just doesn't do that. In fact the only thing it does is cost you money. It will not help you."
3,Awesome back then!,"Back when I got this, it helped a lot. I never got my MX 2004 certificate - back then it was a little ""silly"" to get it, but it was good to go through and learn it from a perspective that you will be able to answer all the questions correctly if you were to go get it.It's important to learn how to learn."
4,Nice Photo-History of the Korean Air War!,"Jim Mesko, who has written a number of military history books for Squadron/Signal, gives the Korean air war the once-over in this comprehensive, eminently readable summary of that long ago conflict.Given the limitations of a 64-page S/S ""Special,"" Mesko does a good job of summarizing the air action. While the subject has been covered before by other books, Mesko's comments on the U.S. ace race and combat ops by Russian and Eastern Bloc pilots adds a little spice to a familiar story.Mesko's text is nicely complemented by dozens of black and white and color photos along with eight pages of color profiles by Don Greer. Many of the photos are new and Greer's artwork, as always, is wonderfully done.All in all, a nicely priced, well-written and illustrated introduction to the subject.****An aside: Some day I hope Squadron/Signal does a ""Best of Don Greer"" book. His profiles and cover artwork are absolutely top-notch."
1,Nauseating.,"It is hard to imagine a more nauseating assortment of festering shibboleths and moronic musings. I can only surmise that it was published without anyone's knowledge. The nonsense Mr. Goodman has served up to naive teachers for 25 years is no doubt responsible for the illiteracy of millions of school children. The most important question raised by his latest book is, 'How long will this fool be suffered?'"
1,Cute title. The only good thing about the book.,An example of facts selected to fit the whole language fad
5,A Sailor's Respite,"I heard this CD over a decade ago and I continue to seek it out as a hallmark of maritime heritage. The instrumental renditions can be haunting, moving and uplifting....if you're a sailor or a lover of the sea, this album will become one of your favorites whenever your thoughts range over the waters. bon voyage"
3,not exactly what I ordered,"I ordered this Pepsi mug for a birthday present- but the mug I received is not the mug you are showing for me to review. The mug I received had the lady logo on it- I would rather have had this one that I had ordered, but there was no time to exchange. Not too happy about it."
3,"Simple, inexpensive, but fully usable","Have had this for a number of years, and it soldiers on. No problems with it. It's basic, but who needs more than that for a keyboard bench?"
3,Nice Size,"Nice compact size, nice looking, and easy to use. Gave it a three because when I ordered it and on my packing slip it said ""with pistol nozzle"" which it did not come with. I do not like things to say one thing and arrive as another."
4,Quite pleased.,"It's a simple, fairly lightweight reel. I'm happier than I thought I would be. I am able to set it down on my lawn and pull the hose out without it tipping over. Although if you were to lay it on it's side, the hose would still unroll just as easily."
4,Ames True Temper 2388100 65-Feet Cassette Hose King Reel,"I have had the product just a short time, and have used it to wash my cars and water the lawn a few times. I like the size of the reel and the quick release capability, which allows for easy removal and storage. Only time will tell about the durability of the reel, but the design definitely meets my needs. Only the small diameter of the hose kept me from giving it a 5."
1,Tips over if pulling out more than half of the hose,"This is fine if you only need 10 or 20 feet of hose, but once you get half of the hose out, the remaining portion is too light to keep the reel upright. It falls over.Also, the winding handle did not rotate properly, making winding very difficult. I am returning this and will continue on my search for a good reel."
1,Leaks everywhere,"One end was made from plastic. It piece broke inside and leaks badly. The other end also leaks, but not as bad.Returned it to Amazon. I wanted it to work because it seemed a good product."
2,Broke on first use,"I suppose this hose reel could be good, but on my very first use, the knob on the reel broke off. So I haven't really been able to try it out well. But it sure doesn't give me much confidence when it breaks right away."
2,"Okay design, but cheap materials, leaks","The quality of the hose material and the reel didn't seem high; for the price I would have been okay with it but there was a bad leak inside the housing where the hose connects to the inner coupling that leads to the water supply. Didn't try to fix it (not my job!) - returned for refund, no problem."
2,"Leaky, Leaky, Leaky = Wastes Water!","Before we got thru the first season with this product, it was leaking water from the inner connection. We've tried uncoiling the hose to it's fullest extent so we could make adjustments to the leaking connection, but to no avail. We just could not stop the water from pouring out of that connection, no matter what we tried to do. What a waste of water! We're looking for a replacement product, or a less leaky way to store the hose itself."
4,Practical for small yards or occaisional hose needs...,"Ames True Temper Cassette Hose King Reel with 65-Foot HosePros:- Compact, so it doesn't take much room to store.- Lightweight, so it's easy to carry or put on an upper shelf for storage.- Comfortable to carry when rolled up.- Simple rewind mechanism works with little effort.- Rustproof; so it can stay outside.Cons:- Light-duty thin hose material can kink. It won't last as long as a heavier-duty hose, if used frequently.Summary:I've had mine for about 10 years, but use it only occasionally (e.g., with a utility sump pump).This is a good choice if you have a very small yard or little room to store a hose."
1,"Ordered Two, Both Defective","I ordered two at the same time (one for front of house, one for the back) and they were both defective.While one leaked from the bottom of the housing that connects to the faucet, the other one GUSHED water from inside the case where the outside line should connect to the actual hose."
1,Leaks horribly,"I have 2, they both leak horribly. I would be happy to update my review if provided a non-leaking unit."
1,Wimpy Hose,"The one thing that is NOT advertised or described is the fact that this is a very small diameter hose. Hooked it up to a spigot, extended the hose its full length and depressed nozzle and got a very poor stream of water that didn't extend more than 5 feet. Checked hose for kinks, connection to reel, spigot connection and could find nothing wrong.This is useless. Returning unit to Amazon."
4,Could not find this item anywhere except at Amazon.,"I had looked at all the home improvement stores, walmart, everywhere and could not find this item. We use it in our business and needed to find another one. I was so thrilled to find it on Amazon."
3,A complete overview of ska & swing.,"I bought the box set. I'm not a fan of swing, only ska with punk overtones. The set is divided into 5 cd's; swing, instrumental, cover tunes, bonus tracks, and the Punk it Up cd. I'm going to give the swing one to my 70 year old mother. It'll bring back memories for her. The instrumental and cover tunes cd's go into my ""give away"" pile too. The bonus tracks cd has a couple of good offerings, by Mephiskapheles and of course the ever pleasing Mustard Plug. The Punk It Up cd is by far the best, and is well worth purchasing singly. Unless you want an overview of everything that's out there--don't buy the box set."
4,Good Game!,"Plays well. Not as mechanically fun as the original, but still a great game in it's own right. Additional playable characters also make it interesting."
3,Not a bad remake at all.,"This game was a well put-together remake of a classic PS1 game. What was epic in 2.5-D has been made even more epic in 3D, with necessary changes in the plot and mechanics (personally, I found it more appropriate for the main character to wield a gun instead of a knife). If your are a fan of the Wild Arms series, I definitely recommend getting this game.Wild Arms Alter Code F"
2,Incorrect information listed.,"Miss leading information provided. It is not ""bags"" but just one 10 ounce bag. The MSRP of $129+ makes you think that there would be multiple bags of at least 10. I returned and got a prompt refund. It is a great product, but my local pet store sells them for under $20 a bag."
2,Not very good,"These are thin and tens to break up in the bag. ,y dog doesn't like these but eats other lamb treats.."
1,horrible experience,I was sent one bag of Texas Hold 'Ems instead of 12 that i ordered and paid for. I was charged $113.00 for one bag. The 11 bags that were later sent to me were horrible. The lamb treats were all broken into tiny tiny pieces in the bag. I have ordered this product from other companies and never had a problem. The lamb treats were a decent size fillet.I would not order from this company again.
5,"A *MUST* READ FOR ANY FAN OF ""THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS""","As a huge fan of the Y&R from its inception, I was very entharalled and delighted with this book. It is a *MUST* read for any fan of this show. Not only does it take you down memory lane, but it refreshes the memory of many story lines."
5,Miike at his finest,"I love takeshi miike films. This film goes well away from his trademark gore. This is a simple fable of a mystic pristine far away land and the people that inhabit it. The 2 vistors, one business man one bill collector flail helplessly, complements of the beauty and folklore. The ending is overwhelming and still haunts me. Extremely worthy, this one will stay with you."
5,One of Miike's Best,"Those of you interested in Miike's more gritty violent works like Audition, The Dead or Alive Trilogy, or Ichi the Killer may be in for a bit of a shock with this one but there is still plenty to love here. This film bought Miike alot of credibility in his homeland and when you see it it's easy to see why. Check it out if you're a true Miike fan but if you're just in it for the gore and the shocks consider checking out Gozu (equally great and also available this month) instead."
3,not as good as I had hoped,"While the story is intriguing and the scenery breathtaking, I was unimpressed with how the story was told. The direction, editing and needless special effects sprinkled throughout dragged down what could have been an excellent film. A scene of terrible animal cruelty also was a major turn-off; the plot point could just as easily been made off-screen. An interesting movie and worth watching, but not truly great in my estimation."
3,Too special meaning,"Beautiful landscape, poor surrounding, fictional people, realistic Mafia-Yakuza, handsome performers and overextended movie running time.What is all this about?"
3,"Good, but old. Needs to be updated.","Those of us who participate in the CGI programming newsgroups know Thomas' reputation and it's steller. When this book was first released, it was the best book available, and it some ways it still is. But the current edition is showing its age. It doesn't cover many new CGI topics or concepts. I still use this book as a reference now and again, but I wouldn't buy it today."
2,"It is ok, that is if you already know the stuff.","I know if you've read the reviews previous to this one, you should already know that you need to know C and Perl to read this book. But I am going to say it again. And you don't only need to be familiar with it. You need to KNOW it. If you don't, you'll get lost in three chapters like I did. Since it is a book based entirely on examples, unless you understand the code perfectly, you'll be lost. You also need to know the basis of CGI scripting to know where the script is getting at. You may ask if you already should know all this to understand the book, why buy it? For the examples I guess, but don't buy it to learn is my suggestion. Get a Dummie's book for that. Then get this one as reference."
3,This book needs to stop being reprinted,"The basic information and concepts are good but...This book is seemingly out of date. It keeps referring to Netscape 1 for goodness sakes! The example pictures make it clear how outdated this book is. In such a fast changing environment, looking at these examples was a big turn off!But I suppose the information is not completely outdated. There's not much to CGI, so I guess it doesn't really change. Still there are better books out there"
2,Some of the most important sample programs do not run.,"The book does not give you the intire sourse code. Insead, it gives you fragment of the program that does not work. The book contains errors that are either purposely put or the author does not want to share them. Even the author does not give you the ecact answer if you ask him."
3,Decent book if you know how to program,This is a good book if you know C or Perl and need to know how to write cgis. It is not a book for you if you are a not already comfortable with C and/or Perl.
2,Amateurish,"The book is about an obtuse, bungling writer, who cannot help but impose his viewpoints upon his family by teaching them lessons in inane ways. Through much of the book, he is distained by his spouse and children, not to mention the reader. Herein lies the biggest flaw in the book. The reader should care about the protagonist and any discerning one will not.However, he is not alone in his inanity. He stumbles upon crimes ""masterminded"" by a criminal, real estate developer and elected official, all who barely seem to possess the mental acuity to properly organize lemonade stand. A few wacky neighbors are thrown in for spice and laughs, although they are too stereotyped and the humor is largely sophomoric.You have better uses for your time."
2,disappointed,"The first book I read by Linwood Barclay was ""No Time For Goodbye"", which was very good, a real 'page-turner'. I expected the same with ""Bad Move"". Its an okay book, but I'm sorry I bought ""Lone Wolf"" and ""Bad Boys"", which I have not read yet."
1,Very bad move buying this book,Zack Walker does such stupid things that it overshadows any possibility that there is a good plot in there somewhere.
4,First in the Zack Walker series -- stay with it!,"I decided to give the Zack Walker series a try after reading Linwood Barclay's *Never Look Away*. The character development of Zack seems to take a very long time; I stuck with it because I can see a lot of myself in Zack. He is the guy who always means well and wants to shelter his family from all manner of evil, and the results are presented with some great humor. If you enjoy reading crime novels but like to laugh every now and then, this would be a good series to start. I found myself comparing the humor with that of Donald Westlake in his Dortmunder series.If you stick with this and continue on to the next book, I don't think you will be disappointed!"
4,Bad Move,"I'm three-quarters through the book, but so far it is taking a longtime to get to the point. The main character Zack Walker seems like a major lier. So far he hasn't been truthful to anyone. Not sure if I'll read the other three in the series."
2,Honest Opinion,"I thought there was a lot of repetition concerning Zack Walker. This was the only book of Linwood Barclay that I found boring. I love all the rest of his novels. Once I start reading them I can't put them down. I was disappointed with this novel, but I realize it was his first. I could figure out the plot as soon as I started reading this book."
5,His Best,There are parts so funny milk came out my nose. Too bad his first was his best in my opinion. I would have loved to read more like this.
5,terrific !!,This book is so funny and clever. Its an easy read and a very enjoyable one ! Way to go Mr.Barclay !!
2,Skip It,"Someone named Edna Buchannan (I think, I don't have the book in front of me) called this thing hilarious in a blurb on the cover. Never trust anything old Edna says. What the author has done has stocked the book with ""wacky"" characters and put it on auto pilot. There is an professional S&M role player/accountant (see a whacky combination, the fun has started already)who the author assures us isn't really a hooker, thank God. A slick slimy real estate developer with mob ties (there's a reach, why is it nobody else ever writes about sleazy real estate developers?) and a slob of a corrupt local politician. With this cast how can the book fail? It's worse that it sounds. I actually ordered a second book by the author without realizing it at about the same time so I have another laughfest to look forward to. Hope my sides can hold out as the belly laughts keep piling up."
3,Bad moves review,"A decent book but not a great book. bought it because a friend said my writing was like his, ( and Linwood is published afterall)ok plot, but no killer payoff. this guy does not write as well is donald westlake. now there's a killer author."
1,A new experience for me,"Reading this book was definately a new experience. I've never read a novel where I was actively HOPING the main character would get killed. Or at least removed. What IS this book? A not-very-mysterious mystery? A not-very-funny comedy? Honestly, when your main character (Zack Walker)is a whiny busybody with questionable social skills, it's hard to care what happens. After 100 or so pages, I was just hoping he'd get killed. If you want to read something with an irritating protagonist read Fight Club or Choke. But not this. Spare yourself."
5,Absolutely hilarious.,"The cover states ""If Dave Barry wrote mystery, it would be something like Barclay's Bad Move."" Which is true, because as I read it I was reminded of Dave Barry's mysteries, which apparently the writers of the blurb didn't realize Barry wrote - though I'd call both this one and Barry's books ""criminal capers."" However, as a Dad with (so my kids say) a little bit of the central character's tendencies in me, I found Barclay's Bad Move even better than Barry's work. This is a very funny book, enough so that when I read this back in April, '06, I ordered the hardback of the second novel, Bad Guys, without waiting for it's soon-released paperback version. The story centers around Zack Walker, a married father of two, whose attempts at life's lessons to his family tend to . . . go awry. Throw in a few fellows of criminal intent, and you have a great story."
2,Disappointed,"Just couldn't get interested.in this book so I was disappointed, and I don't have more words to include in this review."
2,The description doesn't say you need the whole unit.,Bought this unit to hook-up a mp3 player in the car. Didn't realize that you need the HK unit as well. My bad!
3,Better than wireless,"It made a huge difference over the wireless configuration I had at first, much better if your going to be traveling"
1,Beware,"The Harmon Karman Drive and Play does not work well, even with the wired adapter. Constant static, low volume, etc... and I had mine installed at Circuit City after I purchased it through Amazon. I purchased two, and my husband's had the same problems. We don't use them anymore. A waste of money!"
1,Not a 'Wired FM Transmitter Adapter',This is not a modulator. This is simply a wire...it will not allow you to connect your ipod/droid/etc via your antenna.Very disappointed in the description of this item.
3,Satisfactory,Does a satisfactory job (better than the non-wired set-up) but the sound quality is like a weak FM station.
2,"Good sound, but uncomfortable.","I'm a big fan of Aiwa products, but these headphones disappointed me considerably. The earbuds are pretty uncomfortable and difficult to fit completely into the ear, so I could only judge the quality of the sound from halfway in my ear. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but if that IS the case, why are they so hard to put in? Plus, the shape of the headphones is deceiving because the curved part (that is supposed to fit snuggly around the ear) goes underneath the ear instead of on top, so they never fit properly on my head.I will deal with them, though, because I am not going to buy another pair. And people do tell me I have a freakishly small head, so maybe it's just me."
3,Love CD but.....,"Eventhough I like how this CD is packaged, nice cover and all, I decided not to purchase this item for two reasons. #1 - I already have Swingtime's Birth of Soul CD put out sometime in the early 90's with complete and correct name of tracks. #2 - I love all the songs on this CD and ""Late In the evening Blues"" is one of my favs and because its not on this CD there is no reason for me to purchase it. Even if I didn't have the previous mentioned CD. I'm just a stickler that way I guess. But if missing a song doesn't bother you, you should purchase this CD. Or try to buy the CD with all correct selections."
5,The Begining of The Genius,"This is the absolute best compilation of Ray Charles' early recordings that I've ever seen or heard. No personal collection of Rays's music is complete without it. If you're a fan of The Genius, this collection of his Swing Time & Doen Beat recordings is a ""must have""."
2,CatNip,"It is a great price for the seeds. I planted half of the bag when I first bought them and only 2 seeds sprouted. I just planted the rest of the seeds and I have no idea how they will do, but I will post again when or if they sprout"
1,Dead plant.,"I placed them in a green house with a ""Grow-Growth ""soil and waited,and waited ,and waited and...... Nothing!!!!!"
1,Scam,"I opened the envelope to find 75 seeds, if that. Will never order from this seller again. Also I planted them and haven't had 1 sprout yet. I don't usually write bad reviews."
1,does not grow,"i like the amount of seeds given but after planting all of them not a single one germinated will not buy from this seller again, bought same kind of seeds off ebay and had sprouts within days, very disappointed"
5,Great!,I planted these in an indoor planter and they took to it well. Also lasted a very long time. I will buy these again.
3,Kind of unsure on my position,"Honestly, I planted over 200 seeds last season and out of that many I laid down I only got two sprouts and both died before they got an inch tall. I'm not sure if I just got a bad batch or what happened. I do know it's not my soil or anything I have added that did this. I am fairly skilled with soil analysis and have a pretty good idea of the contents of my soil I grow plants in. Not to mention none of my other plants had this issue including tomatoes, watermelon, onion, garlic, cilantro, sage and jalapenos. Still undecided but truthfully concerned about the quality."
1,No grow,"I, too, was unable to get more than three (actually only two) seeds to grow. I planted half of the pack of seeds...but only two sprouts. That is about a 1% germination rate. I will try planting the remaining half, but at best that would be a 50% germination rate. I do not recommend this product to anyone."
2,From 400 seeds only 10 germinated,Perhaps if you planted on spring time will grow. But in October from 400 seeds only 10 germinated. I perhaps try next time on spring time ;-)
2,More of a critique on Child Molesters than a Mystery,"I give this book 2 stars for being well written, but as a mystery the plot stinks. This book is mostly a social commentary. The author doesn't even try to develop the mystery here. Even the main character sounds bored and asks herself whether or not she even cares to find out who done it."
4,Not in My Backyard,"First off, I have to say that I LOVE all the E.J. Pugh mysteries. Susan Rogers Cooper could write about making a grocery list, and as long as E.J. was the one making the list, it would be highly readable and entertaining, and surely funny. My only criticism of this book was that Cooper does not spend enough time putting E.J in her best element-her family. The interaction E.J. has with Willis, Vera, Luna, Grahm, Megan, and Bessie is what makes each of her books so special; to me the mystery plot is just an excuse to get these wonderful characters together. I hope that future Pugh books have more of this witty and real interaction than Not in My Backyard did."
4,Solid,"This is a solid cd full of catchy power pop tunes. You can't go wrong with it. If I have to be critical, I'd say the only flaw is that it's a little too polished, but that's because I like music with a little slop to it. I've seen the band live, and they have a bit more edge, as do most bands. Regardless, this is a great album by a very talented band."
5,a extremely helpful and beautiful book!!!,"THIS very informative book was written with great compassion,professional knowledge and expertise...and most of all love.i bought this book years ago in my 20's and i have worn thisbook out that it is in 2 halves...much dogged eared...i usethis book like a best friend/medical bible..."
5,His Heart to Yours,"This book is a daily devotional guide that will give you strength passed from the Lord through an author that humbly gives her faith in daily doses that inspire and encourage its reader. I find strength virtually every time I read even if I am reading for the second time. This book is not overwhelming for a new Christian, but also presents encouragement found in the gospel that can guide even the most ""seasoned"" Christian. Good stuff."
5,Early Canadiana,One of the early 60's Toronto rock bands. Passion and variety of music. Hard rock with a touch of blues...exceptional. Very glad they are getting a chance to shine.
3,Nice listing and explanations,Nice updated listing of main extinction events in earth history and disertion on the main still accepted theorites explaining way these happened. No big novelties or radical thoeries but some points were new for me like the frozen methan gases accumulated in huge cuantities in the bottom of cold seas and the possible climatic changes that could be cuased by them if they are realesed to the atmospher by higher ocean water temperatures.
1,Not patent leather,"The boot is okay. Pros: Tall boot. Will look great w/skirts,dresses and pants. Cons:The material is that of hard leather. Boot runs a little small. And, the Amazon description is incoerrect. It is not patent leather by any stretch of the imagination. nor is it drak brown It is made of a hard, inflexible leather material.So, if you're looking for patent leather this is not the boot. For the price its not a horrible boot, but if you looking for quality as well as value I say keep looking. There are many great boots on Amazon that will meet the criteria."
3,Could have been better,It would be alot better without the little talking in between takes. I enjoyed the song '4 seconds' which was the only good song to me on the album. A few other songs are just okay. It seems like it was rushed. I'm looking for the next one which can't be worst but hopefully alot better.
4,Fearless,"This is the book I wanted and it was out of print, although it did have a stain, but it is good."
5,Great Gift,I bought the game as a gift for a friend that said she had been searching for the game and was told that Bicycle no longer made it. She really enjoys playing bridge and loves playing it on the pc.
4,Found Parcheesi,"I really enjoy playing the board game Parcheesi on computer. I have searched many places for it, but finally found it on this Bicycle assortment of games. Many other fun games, too!"
2,A Dinosaur,"Bicycle games (board, card, casino) are still in the DOS era. The programs take a full screen to run, and can get an older pc's hard disc grinding away. That said, the games are reasonably well laid out, with several options. And the price was certainly right. It was ok for what we wanted."
3,Old fashioned - good for the old folks,"My husband wanted his old card games back because he lost his original discs and wound up with my computer in our most recent trade-around. It took a while to find this 3 disc series, (Thanks, Amazon) and now that he has it he is happy again.These are the old games - original versions. If that is what you are looking for, you will be pleased. If you are looking for something new, look elsewhere.I gave the product only 3 stars because I think that after all these years these games ought to have been migrated into shareware products. But that is probably unrealistic and all-in-all the price was pretty cheap."
2,Out of Date Games,Wrapped in new shrink but Microsoft Bycycle series is very old. The white letters are backlit and hard too read. Ugh!
4,Microsoft Bicycle Series,I love all 3 games! It gives you hours of fun and you have great choices on games to play on all three!!
3,Good Sound But not Comfy..,These head phones sound good but are not very comfy to wear. Specially *not* for people with glasses.
3,Weird little earphones,"I guess I just prefer the headphones that stick in your ear. I had the aiwa swoops that do that and loved them. They broke and I thought I'd try these. I guess I might have to get used to them yet, but do you see the little plastic arcs above the actual earphones? You're supposed to (I think) put that on your ear like glasses, but my ear is pinched uncomfortably between that and the headphone. Maybe I have oddly shaped ears."
5,Ukiah from a different POV,"Wen Spencer is one of my favorite authors. Her books are all well written and tightly plotted tales which, happily, following finite story arcs unlike some authors who will remain nameless, but y'all know who I'm talking about. One of the most appealing aspects is watching the main character grow and change through the initial books in the series and people who start with this one would only later come to realize the sheer pleasure of seeing Ukiah from a new POV. While this book is complete enough to stand alone and will certainly draw in people new to the Ukiah Oregon series, I would advise new readers to start with book one and work their way to book 4. Enjoy them all."
4,Four and half Stars,"Dog Soldier is one good read. I read it straight through. I really enjoy both this series and her Tinker series. She has an easy to read style, a fast pace, and strong characters. I find her characters to be ones that you root for while they deal with their doubts, fears, and dreams.I also love to go to her web site where she freely explains how she goes through the writing process. She is not only keeping her characters interesting in her new books, she is sharpening her style. I can't wait for the next one."
5,Ukiah with a difference?,"Having read the prior Ukiah books with great enjoyment, I was looking forward to more adventures and developments in the Ukiah world. DOG WARRIOR lives up to the other books of the series in action and character development. But now I think of the series as the Dog Warrior world rather than the Ukiah world.Ukiah and Atticus are both clones of Magic Boy, yet Atticus is different from Ukiah. DOG WARRIOR has expanded the story and given a new slant to the Dog Warriors. The addition of Atticus, Ru, and Kyle to the Dog Warrior world widens the oppurtunties for story lines. I have to hope there are other Magic Boy bits floating out there waiting to be written down by Wen Spencer.I read DOG WARRIOR in one night - could not put it done. Wish Wen Spencer could write them as fast."
2,"It's BROWN, not yellow!","I ordered the Joyce Chen Tetsubin cast iron teapot as a gift for my mother. The description says that it's yellow and it looks yellow in the picture. However, when it arrived my mother said that it is definitely brown. The quality of the teapot is excellent; it is very well made but it is NOT yellow."
3,A varied collection of insightful criticism,"Exquisite Corpse compiles Michael Sorkin's earlier works of criticism, mostly published during his time as architectural critic for The Village Voice (his latter writings were later compiled in ""Some Assembly Required""). Sorkin's writing is entertaining and intelligent, and Sorkin's attacks on Philip Johnson, Donald Trump, and former New York Times Architectural Critic Paul Goldberger are particularly amusing. The book is an overall enjoyable read, if one is able to jump between the varied subject matter."
5,Manteca de Ubre,"I love this ointment.Is good for aches & pain. Is used for Massages on swollen legs,ankles & feet, muscle pain, back pain Ect... you name it... It works :) Hispanics always keep a container handy. Highly Recommended it."
1,The WORST possibel Customer Service,Canon stinks when it comes to customer service. I had to sent my Elura70 twice for service within the first 3 months of the purchase. Everytime I call them they come up with different excuses for why my comcorders is not fixed yet...Think twice before buying a Canon....
2,Not a reliable camcorder,"Out of the box, the Elura 70 is fabulous. Amazing shots, nice 18x optical zoom, and great image stabilization. But after recording about eight tapes, the camera started to reject tapes when insterted. The error message ""Remove the cassette"" always appeared and the tape ejected immediately. Now the camera is unusable. Each time I put in a brand new tape the camera will start up, spin some wheels, and then stop the wheels, and eject the tape. I have tried an off-the-shelf mini-DV head cleaner, but that didn't work. Please, beware of this camera."
1,do not buy Cannon,"I had an Elura 50, it had the worst problem in all the camborders I owned. It randomly gave you a 'remove cassette' message, and you can not close the chamber.Search the internet, and you will find Canon has lots of complaint about this problem."
5,"I started taking MSM for Yoga Performance, and got the book to find out more about its benefits.","I started taking MSM to improve my Yoga practice and started noticing other health improvements that led me to look for more information. After a couple of months of taking MSM I found my allergies improved significantly and my UTI were gone. I was thrilled and wanted to find out more about this miracle substance. The Miracle of MSM, is a great book that has full information on MSM and offers testimonials that are really helpful for finding the right dosage and correct use of MSM for different purposes. The book is a great reference and confirmed my experience with MSM and hundred other benefits this substance has. I really recommend its reading before using MSM so you get the most out of it."
1,MSM for pain,"The book was ok,explained a lot about MSM as a pain reliever but I was extremely disappointed in the productof MSM.I expected at least SOME RELIEF but have not gotten any.I am at the bottom of one lg. bottle.I started out with 3/4 teas. as suggested & worked myself up to 1 teas.2x times a day and have not noticed any change in my pain level.In powder form it is horrible tasting so I had to mix it with water with a flavoring in it & drink in one gulp.If you are trying it,try the pills instead but don't expect good results.I also take tart cherry both in pill & concentrate to aid in taming inflammation."
4,Definitely worth reading,"What I liked best about this book was its honesty. It says MSM is a miracle for some, while for others it does nothing at all. MSM is recommended for rheumatoid arthritis, which I have, and I find it does not help with pain or inflammation. But it does give me more energy. And as side benefits, my hair grows incredibly fast and my allergy symptoms are not as severe."
5,Great Book!,"This book provides some suggested doses for the conditions it covers. That is exactly what I was looking for! It has helped me with my monthly cramps and my energy. Great, easy read book"
5,"This book has nothing to do with ""Bill Rich""","This book is based upon solid research of a natural substance that is nuturing every living thing. It is found in your own body.One of the reviews here mentions the name ""Bill Rich."" Many of the statements about him are true, but he has nothing solid to do with MSM, other than he stumbled upon it and tries to sell it.This book and Bill Rich should not be mentioned together (forgive me). Mr. Rich does not speak for MSM, anymore than a bad teleevangelist speaks for God.Get the hardback edition of this book, it will change your life for the better!"
3,A good introduction,"I found Brian Clegg's biography of Roger Bacon to be a good introduction for anyone wishing to understand the great man's life and work, and the times in which he lived. However, this book seemed to me to be too focused on Bacon as a precursor of the Scientific Revolution, and at times I would question the depth (although not necessarilly the breadth) of Clegg's understanding of ancient and medieval science. Whilst the author has obviously done a lot of research, and his admiration for his subject shines through at every page, this is not a truly scholarly life of Bacon that would be of great use to academics. But, having said this, I would still recommend this book for anyone coming at Bacon for the first time."
3,Worth it if it fits your interests...,"This is the textbook designed to accompany the Civil Air Patrol book, ""Horizons Unlimited"". Although it is not standard issue to the cadet, I found it to be more interesting the HU, as it went into more detail and the pictures were in color. If you have the money and interest, it is worth the investment."
3,"Theory: yes, practice: no","The book is long on theory and history of radio drama. If you need that, buy it! If you are looking for practical guidance to produce radio drama, only about three of 23 chapters will be of help. But you might find more in its bibliogrpahy. J."
3,INCONCEIVABLE!!,"Inconceiveable is the word. If you think you are a seasoned adventure gamer, and can solve puzzles with the best of them, then this game is for you. Make it through the Easter Islands. Enter Egypt. Find out what real puzzling is all about. It's not about the dialogue, or the inventory items, it's about the interaction with your environment, being observative, and intelligent. The average joe will get no where in this game. Sorry but it's true. You have to be a puzzling lion to solve these puzzles. Good luck, may the force be with you."
5,One of the Best,"I've heard a lot of garage-band sounds from the mid-1960s, and this is surely one of the best. Imagine the Stones releasing a different version of ""Aftermath"" in 1966, without the exotic elements, wherein they hone upon their 1965-era sound, and there you will find ""Somewhere Outside."" To quote Dave Bingham (lead vocalist for the Ugly Ducklings) in relation to a 1966 Stones show in Toronto (in which the Ugly Ducklings were the opening act): ""Mick Jagger heard it [the Ugly Ducklings' song, ""Nothin'""] on the radio on his way in from the airport, and later proclaimed that the 'Ducks' were his favo[u]rite Canadian band."" Every song on ""Somewhere Outside"" (most of them being original compositions) is quite unique, and their Anglo-Great Lakes outlook must have been a genuine source of envy at the time--for those who knew, of course."
2,Weber Summit Platinum D6 Built-In Natural Gas Grill,"Don't buy into the hype, I forked out close to $2,000 and regret it. My biggest complaint is the terrible customer service, which I was led to believe was among the best. Every time I have called in the customer service reps have been rude and unhelpful, their lack of product knowledge is shocking!!! I am also waiting on a replacement part that was due weeks ago. Called Weber on numerous occasions and get a different response every time. I've also been told I would get a call back on several occasions because the rep on the phone couldn't answer my questions; I have yet to get a call back!!! Don't spend the money, I had my previous grill for 10-years, which I paid about $200.00 for. Wasn't as sharp looking and the BTU's weren't equal to Weber but my expectations were a lot less than when I paid $2,000."
5,Excellent Southern Rock!,"First two albums from Point Blank are as good, or better than anything ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and other 70's Southern rockers have issued. Great vocals, and amazing dual guitar harmonies, make these two albums a must for any true rock fan. Both albums were produced by ZZ Top's producer."
1,"""Remove the Cassette"" problem","Our Elura 60 also has the ""Remove the Cassette"" problem that other reviewers have posted. Search for this error code and you'll find thousands of pages of frusterated Canon owners and no fix to be found."
1,The Fiat of camcorders,"When it worked, this camcorder is a thing of beauty. The pictures are brilliant, the sound is good, and the battery lasts a respectable amount of time. The menus were fairly straight-forward for a novice to use. However, this thing spent to much time in the Canon factory shop because it kept needing to eject the tape, but couldn't. It basically became unuable. 1-2 tapes and it would go back to the shop. The factory is great - free repeairs, motherboard and fuse replacement - and returned in about a week. However, all these returns and lack of confidence and we've barely recorded anything of our newborn, now a year old! I'm going to buy a non-Canon camcorder for my baby's 1st birthday. Can't take that risk again!"
1,Not Durable At All,This is the second unit of the same model we have purchased and both have broken at the holes where screws secure it to the house. Any pressure against it causes the cracks and eventually fails. Would not recommend this to anyone.
1,faulty design,Too much stress is placed on the mounting area where the screws go through the unit to attach to the wall. Poor design. No replacement parts. Waste of $30.
3,Just okay,the wall mounted hose reel is an okay product that should be reinforced at the mounting holes. That's the weak point of the design. The product arrived in a previously opened box I think it was a return. It leaked and I had to replace the o-ring seal to make it work properly. That was much simpler than mailing it back. The vendor to Amazon was obviously the problem.
5,Replacement,"I needed to replace the hose Reel that was mounted on the wall, the existing one was 11 years old. Found the identical model so I was able to hang the new one on the existing screws already drilled in the wall. This is a great reel if the new one last 10+ years, I'll be happy."
1,Poor Mounting and Connections,"Agree with others regarding poor housing mounts. Mine also broke after a few months, and while they sell some replacement parts, the mounts are not one of them. This is my second unit and I did get a replacement under the warranty for the first one after it broke. The water lines also tend to rust and leak after a while. I have not tried other brands but there must be something better."
5,The best hose reel,I continue to use this product even in a ground-mount configuration because this is the only hose reel available with the hose inlet external to the reel flanges.
2,Ames HoseKing Quality,I purchased this Hose Reel and it lasted about 3 years. The constant pulling on the reel cause it to crack and come off the wall. I also had a minor problem prior to this that the small hose that comes with the reel clamp broke thus limiting the water flow. I used tie straps to correct this problem. This product should be made of stronger material.
3,"""Works of art""",The audio on this album excellent.True works of art.I only wish they had reprint in english for this deck.
5,Out of this world!,"If you meditate or need inspiration, this is worth having in your collection. Gene Newton is a master musician and this is as good as it gets!"
2,It's a real workout!,"This product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit. What it doesn't say is that you really get a workout. No matter what incline it is in, it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil. If you want a strenuous workout, then this unit is for you. If you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface, then this is NOT the unit for you."
4,Great Machine,"I bought this machine after reading reviews for it and most were not good. I must say I'm glad I ignored them-It's a great bargain for someone who doesn't have the money to spend on an electric one. While adjusting the belt can be alittle difficult once you have it set there usually isn't any need to adjust it further.I am disabled & a klutz but I feel comfortable on this because it goes the same pace I do.My only complaint and it's a small one, is with the readout panel-if you're not careful it may fall off-there needs to be a better way to attach it. Otherwise, a great treadmill for the money."
4,"Yes, I would buy it again.","This machine is a great buy for the price. It was simple to put together, doesn't take up much room and is easy to use. There is just a little noise when you are walking, but nothing the TV can't drown out."
4,Great for the price,"I wore out my last treadmill and was looking for something smaller, quieter and inexpensive. This was a great find. Takes a little getting used to after a motorized treadmill, but love it now. Only negative is the height of the handle bars. I'm 5'8"" and took a few times to find the right stance without bending over."
3,Good workout for the bucks,"This is my first treadmill. It will certainly give you a good, hard workout being a manual. My only complaint is that the short length and narrow width prohibits me from using my normal walking stride,but it's good for those times I can't or don't want to walk the neighborhood. The price was right and fairly easy to put together - just be patient if you have to adjust the belt - eventually, it stays put."
3,product is nominal,"I bought this treadmill for my brother (I have a manual treadmill from another manufacturer.) The Edge 500 works fine but be forewarned, its not intended for tall or average height people. My brother can't use it, causes him back pain (I'm getting him another piece of equipment.) It's difficult for me to use also (and I'm five feet tall.) So again, very good product for very short people. Unfortunately, I'll be donating the one I purchased."
5,Edge 500 Manual Treadmill,"The only problem I had with it was the console. The wires wouldn't reach . But I simply unscrewed the console, and fortunately was able to shove the rubber covering the bar over a bit and then screw the console back on and then the wires connected without difficulty. The console works very well, and the whole thing took only about 2 hours to put together. It works well, but there is no way to make it flat, if that's what you want. But I think it was worth the money."
1,Several Problems,"I have used treadmills for years & got this one about 2 months ago. First off I called the manufacturer before purchasing to determine if this treamill had a flat horizontal setting. They told me it did. When I got it I found they had lied. NO it does not. All settings are at an incline. About a week after the return policy was no longer in effect, the console readout went on the blitz. It resets all readings every minute or so back to zero. Lastly, the tread is nicely centered, but it often sticks and stops my gaite cold. They suggested white lithium grease, but that does not solve the sticking problem. Am I the only one who got a lemon? Most reports on this model are pretty good."
4,Excellent Customer Service,"Amazon is awesome to deal with as was the vendor of this product. I had a slight issue with a mechanical problem, I called the vendor's customer service and they remedied my problem ASAP. Thanks to all for great service."
3,Theraputic support,"It seems a little big. It is not real clear that there is only ONE stocking in the box. It should be noted that the box contains ONE support. We wanted TWO, and now have to order another."
4,"me, I like a full back",I love this brand but I am a little partial to the fuller version. The bikinis were REALLY low on me. I do not wear that low of a pant so not really necessary. i am still loyal to this brand however.
4,*A Nice Collection of Songs*,"Because I enjoyed listening to everything on Apache's ""No Reservations"" album, I thought I'd like ""The Best of Apache"" as well. I was right. My favorite songs are Movin' On, Right Time, and Ragamuffin Girl. This is a great CD to buy if you are an Apache fan!"
4,A good cross between ambient techno and drum-n-bass...,"Don't let the morbid title or goofy cover artwork deter you. ""Razorblades N Icecream"" is trippy, dreamy, and fun techno.Most of the tracks on this super-cheap CD are a little too drum-n-bass for my tastes, but if you're into Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, or Hive -- you'll find a lot to like here.The real gems on this CD are ""Cryen"" and ""Techstyle,"" which groove a bit slower and a bit better in my opinion.If you've got a dollar to spend, you can do a lot worse!"
1,Deceived,"You should warn your customers that the book comes in the form of a ""manuscrip-like book"". You advertised it as an ""Affordable & High Quality Paperback Book Edition"" which is not entirely true. The real description should read: ""Affordable, manuscript-type book in A4 size paper, printed in 'courier' set type"" margins not justified to the right"".That way I would NOT have bought it, since the format is very difficult for me to handle. In fact as the picture of the cover ""shows"" the front cover, when you align it to other books you are deceived in thinking it's a ""normal"" paperback."
5,Delightful,"Lost in Austen is charming. It makes a modern person want to read the Austen books to see what all the fuss is about. It never laughs at itself. Because the characters take themselves and the absurd plot premise seriously, it is totally believeable. I can't wait to watch it again."
3,Not for those who don't want the original messed with,"I thought I would love this movie, but instead found it long and disappointing. While the premise is really a great idea, some of the twists don't sit well with me.I cannot stand the thought of poor Jane marrying that idiot Mr. Collins, and then Charlotte left for Africa and it turns out Wickham is noble??? It was all to much for me take. I held out hope that all would be righted in the end, but alas, no luck.The best scene in the movie is when she asks Mr. Darcy to walk out of the water for her. I laughed out loud at that, and then immediately, the next Sunday, watched my version of Pride and Prejudice with the fabulous Colin Firth.Not for me, but I can see why some would enjoy."
4,Love all things Austen!,"I have four video versions of Pride and Prejudice - from Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier to Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen - with the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle BBC version as my favorite. So, it's nice to see a different take on the story. It was quite entertaining, and a fun way to spend a weekend afternoon. I always enjoy the creativity (and the stretching of credulity) inspired by time travel stories. There were parts of the story that could have been better explained - but from other reviews I see that the American version is different from the British version (which I now would like to see). The price was good on Amazon, and as I have Prime delivery - it arrived really quickly! If you love Jane Austen (who doesn't?) - this will not disappoint!"
3,American vs British version,"I watched the North American version (1 DVD) and enjoyed it tremendously, but didn't understand some of the scenes until I read the reviews which detailed missing parts, especially the ""Downtown"" scene. I was able to get the British mini-series as shown on TV (PAL) and boy what a difference editing with a chainsaw makes! While the one sold here is funny, the original is really the best since it provides more insight into Amanda's relationship with her boyfriend, etc., things that really didn't make sense. I mean, he didn't seem like that much of a boor or so totally clueless in the American version. So, if at all possible, get your hands on the complete version. The behind the scenes short on the American version was very interesting."
2,Disgraceful movie to Jane Austen,"Horrible, horible, horrible, Bad acting, bad Mr, Darcy, and an insult to other films, like those starring Colin Firth, and Sir Lawrence Oilvier, in Pride and Prejusidce, one big farce unappreciated by this viewer.An insult to MIss Jane Austen the author of Pride and Prejudice and other classic novels."
2,"It was just ""OK""","I caught some of this on tv recently, can't remember the net work. I, myself, am an anglophile and die-hard Austen fan, and I have to say that this one wasn't worth the time I spent watching it. I can see by the reviews that many have liked it. My disappointment could be that anything other than the original work is a poor substitute. I thought the story line was lacking, unbelievable, and boring. Simply put, I thought it was pretty stupid. I watched it for about an hour or so, and then switched to the gameshow network. Even THAT was better than sitting through this awful awful movie. I give it 2 stars, because the actors seemed to be very talented. It's too bad that they now have to be forever associated with this piece of work."
3,An Austen Lifetime type movie,"Mildly entertaining, totally implausible fluff piece. Not bad, but not really good either. Acting was good, if somewhat over the top sometimes. Fun to see a different interpretation but a little bit of a stretch for me."
2,Bland,"Mildly entertaining. That's about it.. mostly boring really. Love Jane Austin, but not this movie."
2,A few crude moments drag down a cute idea,"Fascinating concept...but several ""modern"" moments do this a great disservice. They were absolutely not needed and ruin this as being appropriate for younger teens.Also, the lead actress is not quite compelling enough for this role. She would have been fantastic in some of the other parts, however.This could have been five stars and family friendly..."
2,FREAKIN' WEIRD!,"Jemima Rooper has the remarkable talent of being absolutely fantastic in the most dreadful shows! That being said I just gave the only reason for watching this morbid little curiosity of the molestation of Jane Austen's classic, ""Pride & Prejudice"".Purists will best be warned to close their eyes & ears."
1,Dreadful!!!!! Nothing like I expected after reading the reviews.,"I read all the glowing reviews and looked forward to this DVD. I was never so disappointed. The girl, Amanda, is dropped into the late 1700's in leggings & Black leather jacket with a modern hairdo, and no one notices. Her presence changes everything about the story. Amanda doesn't even try to act like she belongs in that time.I thought she would get everything back on track before she went back to her time, but no.Spoiler Alert.Wickham is a good guy!Jane marries Mr. Collins!!!!!Bingly runs off with Lydia!!!!Elizabeth stays in the future!!!!And Amanda stays with Darcy!!!!!!!The only thing that is corrected is Jane and Mr. Collins never consumate the marriage so she gets out of it, and is able to marry Bingly (who didn't seduce Lydia).If you truly love Jane Austen, don't waste your time on this movie the story is terrible."
3,"Well, It was watchable!","I enjoy Austen and most of the movie adpatations including Clueless and Bride and Prejudice, but this was just too much! Little things bothered me a lot. For all that the main character was an Austen fan, she had little or no concept of how to handle herself in that time. Her clothes were way off the hook and the families acceptance of some strange, oddly dressed stranger just appearing was unbeleiveable. Plus her hair bothered me. I am sorry but young unmarried women in that time did not go about with their hair down! I couldn't even watch the whole movie, just got p$^&ed off and advanced through the scene selections to the end. Kind of a cool idea, lost a lot in the reality!"
2,disappointment,"Sorry but this had all the promise and none of the charm. The lead character was extremely annoying and half the time you wanted to shake her. Mr Darcy was nothing.....no charm, no looks and no personality. Its a shame because the rest of the cast were excellent, the story line intriguing and sets wonderful."
4,Missing bits,"While I love this series, I am disappointed that there are scenes missing. I got hooked on the series through scenes posted on YouTube and several of them are not on the DVD. I would have to think that this was done to fit the entire series on one disk, but the makers should realize that if I am willing to commit 3 hours, I would give up 3.5 to see all of it. Same with the cost, I would have paid a few extra dollars to have a second disk if needed.Still I recommend it. Very cute rendition. My 9 year old sat through all 3 hours last night and at the end stated that she hoped they would make another!"
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful","I can't say enough good things about this movie. My favorite part was fining all of the ""Easter Eggs"" hidden in it. There are so many fun and subtle references to the 1995 version which is universally loved. I think there should be a drinking game made for it. When you see one, you should drink some port."
5,"Bought as a farce, now its a funny friend!","This movie was bought for me by a friend who knew my obsession with period-piece movies and specifically all things Jane Austen. She scored because I rolled with laughter at this quirky Brittish tale where a modern day Londoner who is equally obsessed with Austen finds that a magical door into the world of Elizabeth Bennet opens up in her bathroom and Elizabeth herself walks out. Then, things happen and our new friend from modern day London winds up staying with Elizabeth's family while Elizabeth stays in London. Many many laughs come about from the various fish-out-of water scenarios and I happily recommend this to anyone who both loves period pieces and needs a good laugh!"
5,Loved it!,"I finally bought my own copy and was disappointed that several things were left out, such as Amanda singing Downtown, one of my favorite parts of the series. I wonder why it was edited out?"
3,Another One for the Compleat Austen Collector,"I, too, saw this clever piece on Oxygen this past week. It's entertaining, and I'd like to see it as a whole, rather than over two nights and broken up by seemingly infinite commercials.It doesn't pretend to be yet another remake of P&P;, so one can have fun with it; like ""Bride and Prejudice,"" in a way.No collection of visual Austen artifacts is complete without it! (Or at least having it available at a nearby well-stocked library.)"
2,I found it lacking,"I didn't like this movie. I am sure if you like everything Jane Austen then you would like this movie, but for me I would wait til it came on cable to watch it. The only plus for me was that the actor that played Darcy, played him very well. Other then that I won't be watching it again."
3,not what expected,"Lost in Austento be honest it was somewhat boring at times. the actors weren""t fit for the parts that they we""re playing. very disappointed.kathy taylor"
4,Lost in Austen reviewed,"Just like on PBS, only in one sitting. A great parody of Pride and Prejudice. Anyone enjoying Jane Austen should get a big kick out of this movie."
1,"good idea, bad movie","This movie had some potential in the premise, and the actors were good. I'm going to blame it all on the script. It just went downhill after the first 10 minutes and kept on plummeting. I was literally groaning, ""And I thought it couldn't get worse!"" I hope someone tries this idea again and does it well! In the meantime, don't waste your money!"
3,Lost in Austin,"This was better when I viewed it on PBS. When I bought the DVD, and watched the entire episode, realized it was not as great as I thought. It was good movie with funny moments and the stars were good, the script could have been better, it was ok."
4,"Good, but missing my favorite scene.","My cousin first told me about this movie and I ended up watching it on YouTube scene by scene before it came out. I loved it and was excited to buy it on DVD when it was made available in the US. It is still a great movie, but I was rather disappointed that one of my favorite scenes was cut. I love when Amanda sings ""Downtown"" and feel it is an important part of the movie, but was sad and disappointed it was not included. It makes the rest of that scene rather awkward because the audience does not know what she sang or did to entertain them. One wonders if they were too cheap to pay the copyright on the song and therefore felt American audiences could do without one of the best scenes of the movie. Not cool, not cool at all."
4,A lot of Fun!,"After I got over the fact that one of my favorite stories was being completely destroyed, I actually loved this movie! I think the hardest thing for Austen fans is the fact that our story has been altered. (I say our, because what Austen enthusiast does not see these timeless stories as their own)Once that has been overcome, you can enjoy this movie. Free your mind and the laughs will follow. And this Darcy... my goodness! You'll also see Wickham in a wonderful new light. Give it a chance!"
3,On the fence,"I was excited to see this movie when I first learned about it, but after watching it I feel plagued.While I enjoy watching the story go wrong and having to be fixed, the ending has my stomach churning. Most women wish to find someone like Mr. Darcy, however I cannot help but be upset with how BBC chose to end this. Elizabeth and Darcy are meant to be together, and I sat up thinking over and over about whether I would chose Mr. Darcy for myself if given the chance.I have decided against it. The movie itself isn't bad, but the ending will leave P&P; lovers upset. The greatest love story ever told ended up not being told.."
3,Lead actress did not work for me,"I enjoyed the movie. Loved all the characters except for the heroine. Spent the entire movie wanting to undo her hippy hairdo. Wanted to get rid of the bangs hiding her face. A different heroine would have made the ending more believable for me. Just couldn't picture her with Darcy. I know she had an image the producers wanted but it didn't work for me. I loved the other characters and the plot, but not sure about the ending."
3,Light and fun,"If you like light, fun romantic comedies, and you don't take yourself seriously, then you'll really like this. They put into film what many of us have wondered: what would it be like to be a character from your favorite book (or movie)?I won't go into the details as many other review have plot summaries, but I will comment on something that really bugged me about the dvd release. I have no idea why they did it, but they cut out some scenes from the original tv release. I can't recall all the scenes cut, but the one that bugged me the most was the scene where Amanda sings for Darcy et all at Netherfield Park. It went straight from dinner to them clapping for her. It was a great scene and shouldn't have been cut! If it was due to space limits, I'd rather they cut some of the behind the scenes or here's an idea, add a second disc."
3,Lost in Austen-dvd,"I bought this dvd because I LOVE Jane Austen. It was kind of cute, but too much modernism for me 19th century tastes and ideas of Jane Austen. I didn't like all the twists of character: Wickam is a good guy, Jane gets an annulment, and finally, Elizabeth wants to stay in the 20th century. Interesting, but not a movie I want to watch over and over like a traditional Austen."
5,"Love, good standby movie...","One of my favorites. If you love Pride & Prejudice, you need this. Who hasn't wanted to visit a favorite story before?"
4,Modern Jane Austen,I am a Jane Austen fan and was sceptical about this film but it was recommended to me by a friend. I was delightfully pleased and would recommend it to other Jane Austen fans though I would point out that most men would not be interested in this film.
1,No resemblance to Jane Austen,"The only similarities between this movie and Jane Austen are the names of the characters. Other than that it is a horrific example of a good idea going terribly wrong. I, too, was offended by the crudeness and attempt to modernize the movie with trendy, but inappropriate themes. UGH. Don't waste your time. It was a total waste of mine. Jane Austen would be rolling in her grave to have her name attached to this junk that calls itself a movie."
1,Please don't ruin a great book,"A fan of Pride and Prejudice may be reeled in by the quirky description of this movie, but do not be fooled. Anyone one who claims to love the story as much as the main character does would not allow the foibles to take place. Jane and Collins get married??? If she were as big a fan as she claims to be she would have taken a bullet before that happened. The first half of the movie I enjoyed it but then it goes quickly downhill. Send Elizabeth back, have Michael make a proposal scene worth her acceptance, but please oh please don't make another movie like this one."
1,Worst Movie EVER.,"Anyone who claims to love Jane Austen's work and ALSO enjoys this movie must be under the influence of an extremely strong substance. I have never seen the beauty and the respectability of a classic work so defamed in film in my entire life. Do you think Jane Austen would find it appropriate to talk of ""landing strips"" or various conversations on sexual orientation? I think not. Interesting concept for a movie, horrible execution. I am extremely surprised that this film was so highly reviewed..."
1,"""Monstrous"" ""badly done""","I thought this quite ""badly done."" When you take a pastiche of dialog from various novels and claim to have lived with Jane Austen for most of your life, but use the adverb form for ""monstrous,"" it seems to me a dead give away that you actually know the novels much less well than claimed. It is ""monstrous"" if you are trying to use english as Jane Austen used it, NOT ""monstrously."""
1,disgusting,"I watched the first third of this movie and decided enough is enough. I've learned that to watch a modern movie, you may have to turn your head and politely ignore a few moments of dialogue. This movie, however was sprinkled with such disgusting bits and pieces that I finally had to say ""Enough!"" and turned it off forever. It had such promise. Being a Jane Austen fan I looked forward to seeing a movie of a modern-aged Jane Austen reader being trapped in the works of Jane Austen. I wonder, however, how a woman so indecent, so crass could read the works of Jane Austen, and it not affect her behavior in a positive manner. This woman, was in her conversation, so repulsive that she would have probably been arrested, or at the very least, shunned. What an insult this movie is to anyone who watches it. I am surprised that it has such good reviews by others, all I can say is that they were cheated, and don't even know it."
4,Very Good,"i watch this last year,i was so surprise about this, im big fan of Austen books and films. i bought it cause i really enjoy wathing it over and over so well acted, the places they take you, and the new things that happend are so good.please give your self a chance for a diferent way to tell this story from one of the best novels ever written..."
4,time travel in the attic,This movie reminds me ofThe Complete Works of Mark Twain-- A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Volume 5)in which the person going back in time manages to screw things very badly; nothing comes out like the book said it should.But the result is very entertaining ( I really liked when she had Darcy get his shirt wetin a romance novel form!).I suppose that you have to love the Jane Austin 19th century gold diggersto get this movie. The husband hunt of the Bennet girls still makes for humortoday. The geek that the older sister is forced to marry and his very strangebrothers makes one sorry for them through time?This movie is one of the most funny and entertaining that I have seen lately.
2,Don't Buy This Versiuon,"The Brit version has Amanda singing ""Downtown,"" which is extremely amusing. It's cut out in this version - on the net its ""copyright issue,"" but I have read other U.S. versions have the song. Amazon should be a bit sharper. The whole thing is amusing of course, but if you ever saw the uncut original..."
5,Dare I say it? -- absolutely fabulous,"What an entertaining tale! I found myself laughing at ""Amanda"", burning with embarrassment for her at times, and being completely GREEN with envy because she was doing what *I* have always wanted to do, ever since I first read ""Pride and Prejudice"" -- BE Elizabeth Bennett.Mr. Cowan's performance as Mr. Darcy puts Mr. Firth's slightly wooden version to shame. He has an exquisitely mobile face and piercing eyes, utilizing both to perfection when giving us a Mr. Darcy who is mannerly and elegant (that ""aristocratic languor"" Amanda speaks of) but inwardly passionate. Sublime performance. Very enjoyable and completely believable.WELL worth the watch, more than once. (Thank you, DVR. lol) Heartily recommended."
5,A really great movie.,"I really thought this was a really good movie and it's one of the kind you wouldn't expect. It has great comedy in it and the character's are really good. I'm definitely going to buy this when I get the chance! For anyone who is a fan of Jane Austen/Pride & Prejudice, I would definitely recommend this to you. It is a fun movie. Well worth the watch and/or buy."
5,Pride and Prejudice fans,This is a great movie to watch especially after you've watched Jane Austine's Pride and Prejudice. I loved the characters in this movie and will definatly watch it over and over.
5,Lost in Austen,"""Lost in Austen"" was good fun! It kept my attention even though I've probably wstched ""Pride & Prejudice"" over a hundred times, in every version. Someone with a good imagination took a classic, added to it, changed it up a bit and yet kept the basic entertainment value. I highly recommend it to Austen fans!Charlotte Stout"
5,A must see,"The reason I ordered this dvd was because I was watching the series on PBS and I just couldn't wait a whole week for the next episode, yes, it is that good. There are many twists to the story that made it funny at times. One of the things I like about it, is that I can relate to main character, I too wish to take part of the story and meet Mr. Darcy. I don't know what Jane Austen would think about it but as for me I liked it. It was highly entertainning. The only dissapointing part is that there is a deleted a scene but I was lucky to find it in YOUTUBE."
4,Definitely for Jane Austen Fans,"After a somewhat tedious start, one slowly is able to enter into the conceit of time periods being inter-changeable. Once that has occurred, the story takes off delightfully to an unexpected but acceptable conclusion. Definitely for Jane Austin aficionados and for those who enjoyed ""Pride and Prejudice"". If you are not yet acquainted with Jane Austen's books, this may give you a foretaste of future delights, as you may choose to explore her work."
4,Love it!,"A fun and entertaining take on a classic. My only gripe with this DVD is that it didn't come with very many bonus features. Nevertheless, I definitely recommend this for any Austen fan."
5,Thouroughly Enjoyable,Must have for Austen lovers as long as you take it with tongue in cheek as I'm sure was intended. I watched this on TV and bought it as a gift for my daughter who loves everything Austen.
2,Bizarre,"I believe I sat with my mouth hanging open in disbelief for the whole three hours. ""Same Story Different Centuries""? Nothing could be further from the truth. Going into details will give the whole story away, but if you are a true Austen fan (as I am), it's difficult to find anything to like in this movie. The explanation for Amanda's presence/Elizabeth's disappearance is spurious, at best. Mr. Darcy is borderline evil, and his and Amanda's attraction to each other is a complete mystery. The only reason I gave it two stars is for the few humorous moments that can be found (for example, Amanda kneeing Mr. Collins in the groin - so satisfying!). Other than that, it was way too long, and the point (if there even was one) was completely lost on me. It's only redeeming feature is that it has served to remind me why I have consistently refused to read Austen sequels since that first horrible one many years ago. My advice: ditch this movie and re-read the novel. There is nothing better."
1,Hear that? It's the sound of Jane Austen rolling over in her grave,I can describe this movie in one word: Obscene. What began as a clever idea ended as a complete waste of time. Miss Bingley a lesbian? Mr. Bingley an alchoholic? Mr. Wickham's the good guy? Jane marries Mr. Collins? What is up with all the vulgar language that makes the film anything but attractive? It was all in very poor taste and I think that Miss Austen really is rolling over in her grave at the preposterous antics of the writers. It drug on for three hours and yet the audience is left with little understanding of these new characters charading under familiar names. What a waste of time.
2,Okay but not great,"The movie was okay but not great. Jemima Rooper,for me, was not a good choice for the lead role in this movie. I found it hard to really care about her. This is not a movie I would watch twice. I've watched Pride and Predudice at least 25 times."
2,Much Too Long,"I'm a huge Jane Austen fan, but this DVD went on too long even for me. The acting was good, and the story line was solid up to a point, but then I found myself wanting it to hurry up.If you have a great block of time free and a love of Jane Austen, this is the DVD for you."
4,Great movie,"This has become one of my favorite movies! It's a Jane Austen mash up. Great cast, well written plot makes this a must see movie. It does help to know the plot line of Pride and Prejudice. So, maybe, see the Collin Firth movie version of P&P first."
4,"I Adore Pride And Prejudice,And I Still Thought This Was Fun!","Yep,there is some 'risque' talk in this that was naughty and a shock,and even a very few incidents of cursing,but I still had fun watching it and chuckled several times."
3,Yea!,I was way excited to be able to find this on DVD as all other forms of viewing were difficult at best. I do wish that the show went into more depth but I like the show and therefore remained amused.If you love Jane Austen spin offs then this is a fun one!
3,A Funny B movie,"The premise is funny but the acting is just a B+. The main reason the rating was low for me was the crudeness. Amanda Price says several crude phrases that made me cringe instead of laugh and there were several other not-so-great things in this movie that it could've done without (and the story would have been better for it).Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to many if any of my friends."
4,Great movie,"I love Pride and Prejudice, and love this movie. I would have left out a couple of small parts which are a little off the wall and embarrassing. But otherwise, wonderful! Special features are great as well."
4,"A new take on a Classic. Different, but good!","For those in love with Jane Austen's books, this movie may or may not be for you. I, myself LOVE Austen's books and the many movies that have been made.I actually enjoyed this movie, because it was not another person's rendition of the Austen's classic, it was an original comedic change from the normal Austen. A modern day girl sent through time...but sent inside of a novel! What I enjoyed most was the continuous unexpected moments and humor. See what would happen if the characters switched partners, or someones real character were made known! Some areas that weren't in the book are in here. Some areas from the book are in here. The ending is a bit different than most would expect, nonetheless, I think it was cleverly done, indeed."
5,Stunning & funny take on a classic fairy tale experience,"Face it ladies, who amoung you who knows the character of Darcy doesn't hold out some glimmer of hope to take the place of Miss Bennet? Well, in this film a young woman does that but certainly not in the way she probably ever dreamed. This movie is funny & filled with great jokes that can easily slip by so that on repeat viewings you can catch something new. There are moments that are poignant & heartbreaking but then others so funny it's hard to find room for them both. The story is contrived, but then that's the nature of the fairy tale, which this film is. There is an almost fantasy/SciFi element here but not really important. Accept the story & the things that make it work & you'll have a film that will make you laugh, cry & just be bloody glad you watched it. To paraphrase Cary Grant: "" Everybody wants to be Fitzwilliam Darcy....hell even I want to be Fitzwilliam Darcy. ""Don't miss this one & enjoy!"
5,Any Austen fan will love this!!,What an orignal and fun idea to place a modern woman back in time to Jane Austen's Sense an d Sensibility. Loved all the characters and how they stay on track about the book but lovely Amanda starts mucking it all up. You get some insight into the characters that the original book never gave and it makes for a great series. I highly recommend it!
4,I can dig it,"The album is named nine based off of the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit of God. I can;t name them off of the top of my head but each song is about each fruit. I enjoyed the lyrical content of each song and I was diggin the production but some of the songs had some beats that just weren't my steez. Other than that this was a pretty good album, both Elsie and Macho came out hard and dropped some dope rhymes. If you dig any of their previous stuff you will probably dig this one too. It's not their greatest stuff in my opinion but I can dig it."
2,Echoing Blues,"Recently I came into the possession of this brand new bluetooth headset and mic.I thought it would be a convenient replacement for my wired headphone and mic but was totally disappointed! The device causes echoes on the receiver's end when used. The receiver keeps hearing his/her replies during the conversation. I have tried using it with mobile and laptop ,making close and distant calls , all results were the same--ECHO ECHO ECHO!!One good thing about it is that it's easy to get it connected with another bluetooth device and can be used as a headset for listening to Mp3s at home but after a certain distance you can hear static noises in the background.Overall,I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it."
2,not much of bargain,"The acoustics are great for the price you pay,but the earphone pads are extremely cheap.So cheap that they were damaged after usage on day one.Also,the earpiece are very uncomfortable!"
2,"Strange story, but interesting...","I'm not really sure how to summarize this book. I had to read it for my intro to creative writing class, since my professor went to grad school with the author. It's about a guy named Iple, who lost his hearing and decides to go to Antarctica with a bunch of researchers. It's also about a shortstop in Brazil. And a dinosaur named Isabella who remembers everything that ever happened in the past. I don't think I would have ever picked this up on my own time, but the style was interesting to look at."
5,Super Authentic,"I searched on line for cook books that touched on authentic Thai cuisine. David Thompson came up as someone who had experienced the culture thoroughly. I searched for a copy of Classic Thai cuisine on Amazon and found a cheap used copy. After receiving it and reading the recipes I found that the recipes are ""Super"" authentic. So much so that I don't know where to get some of the ingredients. When I do find a source...Oh boy, will I be doing some really authentic Thai cooking."
4,Great overall action.,"Pretty much like kenshin storyline, but a little less brainstormer, meaning, less complicated. Nice fights with a lot of action, personnaly i would like though a little more blood, but still an overall very good short anime to watch. RRS."
2,Not the same experience as the other reviewers!,"I often check with Amazon's reviewers before a purchase, and have been warned off a few disaster by doing that. So I'm especially disappointed that this gadget didn't work well for me. I find it difficult to open, and the placement of the blade makes it necessary to draw the sharp, pointed blade toward oneself. It HAS actually opened some of those irksome packages that are the bane of everyone's existence, but still, the overall feeling here is disappointement."
1,What is this thing?,This looks like it needs an engineer to figure out how to use it!!! Too complicated.
1,Cheap trash - save your money,"Ordered two of these.They are cheap and nasty and do NOT fit.Enough said, waste of money."
1,Lame...,"How can you manufacture a product where the headphone hole on the case is only large enough for Apple's and Belkin's headphones? Customers should not have to drill the hole to make it larger. Otherwise, this case would get 5 stars. What a disappointment..."
2,Not great protection no belt clip or kick-stand,"When I got this case I was disappointed. Looked good but not much protection, no belt clip or kickstand- iskin Clara much better (had to get it at the Apple Store). Pass on this one."
1,LCD screen devours batteries,"Unlike everyone else's phones, my caller ID works.But it devours 3 AA batteries every 2 months or so.If you happen to own one of these phones, and you're experiencing similar problems, get a new phone. It's evidently not worth the hassle or postage to have it repaired/exchanged/etc.If you don't own one of these phones, then don't buy one."
3,Get what you pay for...,"THis product really wasn't great...The sound is a bit muffled, but for the price, its about right..I got it years ago, but just wrote the review now...but at least I am still using it...That's one good point, huh.?).."
4,My 12yo loved it,"I bought this book for my son (age 12) but read it myself, too. For me, the beginning was a little slow, but the book became gripping as it progressed -- and by 'gripping' I mean I stayed up until the wee hours to finish it in one sitting. My son loved it so much that he bought a non-fiction Viking history book with his allowance after we read this one.For myself, I'd give it 3.5 stars. My son would give it 5. I'm splitting the difference at 4 stars.We'll be purchasing the 2nd book."
5,Great start to Strongbow series,I thought this was a great book for hstorical fiction lovers. It was a very exciting book that I read very fast. Can't wait for the next one!!
5,the strongbow saga book one viking warrior,"A little slow starting, but once i began it, wanted to finish it in one setting."
4,"A great book, would recommend it for fans of historical fiction","I would recommend this book without hesitation if you like historical fiction. It's got plenty of action, adventure, tension and historical background to make it a great read. I've read this book and am in the middle of the next in the series.The first book takes a bit of time to get the plot going. But it really is a decent piece of work, and very enjoyable. I love historical fiction and Roberts does a commendable job."
4,Bernard Cornwell lookalike or Visa Versa,"I read everything Bernard Cornwell writes & this book is almost a clone of his recent serieas ""Lords of the North"" & the Saxon Tales et al. without the Historical connectionI don't know who got inspiration from whom but I enjoyed the book & it has set up parts 2 & 3 which I have recently bought but have not yet started. It is well written & evokes a good deal of emotion, particularly as Halfdan gets elevated then goes through the funeral of his mother $ the murder of his brother & new found friends.I look forward to parts 2 & 3"
4,Good read,This series of books was well worth reading. Good storyline and characters and nicely written. First time I've read Mr. Robert's books and pleased I have found him. Thanks
5,enjoyed every word,"This book was perfect. I enjoyed it thoroughly from the very beginning. Brilliantly written. Just enough action, just enough scenery discription and emotion. I became very attached to Halfdan, the main character, very quickly. He is a believable character and you are rooting for him all the way. I have enjoyed getting to know him and see his character grow. I was so engrosed in the book, I didn't realize I was so close to the end, when I turned that last page I was hungry for more. Thank goodness for Amazon.com and my kindle, I was able to get and start reading the next book in the series, Dragons from the Sea, right away. I highly recommend this book and the whole series."
1,Waste of money and time.,"Terrible. the writing is extremely juvenile and the spacing of the margins seem indie as opposed to published by professionals. I do understand this is a childrens book but I have read indie middle grade books that displayed better writing style and had better formatting. I can hardly believe HarperCollins was involved in the production of this book, it doesn't seem well edited for content or sentence structure."
2,"About average as a ""tale""","The story is just slightly above average, but the protagonist is too young to be believable. The ""books"" were so short as to be better termed ""short stories."" Still, I might have finished the serries (I read the first two) had not the price increased exponentially as the readers were supposedly cought up in the story. All things considered, I give it a solid 2 stars."
2,Heaven Help Us - Another Attorney Turned Novelist,"Ever since John Grisham started enjoying success with his formulaic legal thrillers it seems that droves of attorneys have decided that they too can be novelists -- Judson Roberts appears to be the latest.I am once again swimming against the tide with an unfavorable review, but I found this book to be very nearly unreadable. Perhaps it is intended for juvenile readers, but I think that even as a young teen I would have blanched at Mr Roberts' stilted prose; and as for his claim to be a descendant of the Viking chieftain who was the father of the Normans, well, after 1100 years -- some 44 generations -- anything is possible, but it's rather a fantastic claim, don't you think?"
5,Wonderful,"At first this book was hard to get into for me because I am use to modern language, but after the first two chapters the intensity of the building situation involving the main character's mother drew me in. Soon I didn't even notice and the book was so good I couldn't put it down. There are only a few books that I have finished in a time span of two days (Harry Potter book 6 being one of them) but this one managed to make the list. With a wonderful historic setting this book creates the illusion of Denmark A.D. 845 so vividly you'd swear it were real. My only problem with the book is it is the first in a series and since it only just came out, it will be a while before I am able to read the next one. I will tell you it is not a cliffhanger ending so you will not die of anticipation. Other than that I loved the book."
4,Great stage setter,"This, being the first in the Strongbow Saga, set the stage and defined the main character. I found myself needing to continue the saga just to satisfy my curiosity as to what he would do next. The main characters quest for revenge and justice really drives the story. Great purchase."
5,Awesome for the Sesame Street lover!,Foe those of you who want your child to listen to great children's songs sung by one of the very best this CD is for you. Bob is a familiar voice that my child loves. Highly recommended.
5,What a Find!,"Tanaquil is the only daughter of a powerful sorceress who lives in a great fortress in the middle of a huge desert...but Tanaquil's life is not the fairy tale it may seem. Her mother is devoted to her magic and has very little to do with Tanaquil. Tanaquil has no magical ability of her own, no friends, and nothing to do but mend a few broken things about the fortress. She is bored, lonely, and discontent with her life.Tanaquil's life is changed forever when she chances to find the skeleton of a unicorn. It is in bits and pieces and scattered, but Tanaquil finds the bones and puts the skeleton back together...and then the unicorn comes to life!For some reason, Tanaquil is drawn to the unicorn and, when he flees her mother's desert, Tanaquil follows. And thus begins an adventure that will change Tanaquil's life forever...and reveal a surprising destiny."
3,black unicorn,"it was ok but it dragged everything on. i was hoping it would have more excitement and scenes with the unicorn, it scarcely shows up. i was ably to guess what would happen next, and be pretty close to what actually happened. as i said above, it was ok, but i dont think im gonna waste my time on the next 2 books."
1,Don't waste your time,"Black Unicorn isn't really worth your time if you don't want to read the sequels. This book is really short, but drags everything out. Near the end there is so much confusion that I had to read it through many times in addition to asking a friend. Tanaquil, the main character, isn't the brightest person in the world. She often fails to see the obvious. The writing style is quite confusing. This isn't your average fantasy tale, it's more about a girl lost in the desert. How fun."
5,An exelent fantasy book for both children and adults,"An exelent fantasy book for both children and adults about the daughter of a sorceress who discovers and brings to life a black unicorn. Exelent characters, well told. A must read for fans of fantasy and magic."
4,Black Unicorn,"Tanith Lee's writing is an interesting mixture of lyricism and wry humor. And the imagery stays with you long after you've read the last page. Her characterization is unique and multifaceted, and the main character's narration is entertaining, but I got a little tired of Tanaquil's ubiqutious cynicism, and the climax, though interesting and unexpected, left something to be desired."
3,Interesting...but nothing extraordinary,"Black Unicorn is about Tanaquil who lives in her mother's desert fortress. Tanaquil is great at mending things and feels trapped in her mother's magical fortress. She yearns to leave and see the world, and is given that oppurtunity when she mends unicorn bones. The unicorn comes to life and Tanaquil finds herself on a journey.Although it kept my attention for the most part, I didn't feel as though I really cared about the fate of any characters. The story felt as though it had very little depth. Every problem was resolved so quickly that you never had time to really care or understand what the stakes were. I really thought that it would have been more interesting based on the plot, but the brevity of the story took much of the fun out of it for me."
3,"Works well, but wears out fast!","This is by far the best-functioning earpiece I've used. The sound is clear, and it is compatible with every phone I've tried. The mute feature is great for the phone I have now, which for some unfathomable reason does not have a mute function built in (!!!). Back to the headset...It's great, but it wears out quickly. The wire between the microphone and the earbud frayed and wore out quickly, so now, people can hear me talking, but I don't hear them. A little disappointing considering you pay a premium for this product. However, I don't have a better earpiece to recommend. If you do buy, just expect to buy again soon."
3,Not worth the extra price,"While still searching for a satisfactory solution for my motorola v60, I tried this headset. While the mic quality was excellent, I found the earbud uncomfortable and had a really difficult time hearing callers on the other end. Especially in the car. I was always very satisfied with the headset that came with my Nokia phone, I wish I could find something comparible for the Motorola."
2,Great Expectations,"Well I thought that if it was Plantronics and it was not their cheapest model then it should function as advertised. Unfortunately after testing it with 2 Verizon LG phones I am sending it back. The ear piece is very big I have to say it was loud enough, but its impossible to fit it comfortably into the ear (and my ears are not small ). As for the microphone it is very bad, people constantly complained that they could not hear me. The mute button is flimsy, you feel like you using 99cent store earpiece. Moreover it adds to the weight of the device thus making it even more uncomfortable. My previous headset which came for free with my Motorola phone functioned much better."
4,good shocks,these fit no problem easy installation. helped raise rear of vehicle to stock ride height and still provide excellet ride. Tows my big enclosed car trailer with these even better.
5,Thankyou school library!,"I love this book. I sleep next to it at night. I hold it close and coo words of endearment.I found this in my school library when i was about seven or eight. (to avoid confusion from here, my school is K-12) from then on, every few months i'd check it out for a project or just fun (i was intensely into this stuff) about my freshman year they revamped the library and i couldnt find it (GASP!!) eventually i located it on the floor, open and in pain. I cried to the heavens WHY?! and promptly put it under my arm and walked away. I've had it for about 4 years in my bed between the sideboard and matress and every time i open it i find something new, interesting and inspirational.only downfall is everything is written as exact so its doesnt include many variations of myths but in these situations its a good starting point anyways."
2,Not what I expected,"When I bought this book, I thought I was getting a reference book on fantasy. This book is not a reference book. The information is not reliable, the choice of entries is confusing, there is no cross reference, and sometimes the information in the entries seem to be made up entirley by the authors. I would not recomend this book unless you want a picture book."
3,Overpriced,"If you use a callus remover that uses these kinds of screens, save some cash. Take one of your small screens over to Home Depot or somesuch, go to the rental tool department, and compare it with the large square or circular sheets of sanding screen sold for floor sanders. It's the same stuff! Find the same grit, buy one sheet, use an old pair of scissors to cut a heap 'o replacement screens. Way cheap. It'll probably ruin the scissors (I favor the $1 ones from Harbor Freight).I got my Sof'Feet from FootSmart. That retailer gets two stars. They screwed up the order pretty badly, but did give me a credit without much fuss."
4,Useful reference guide to tree and shrub identification.,"I like this book as an introductory reference guide to learning how to identify trees and shrubs. What makes it a strong book is the first chapter that shows you details about how to identify if a tree is, for instance, alternating or opposite, if the end buds are false or true, if the the pith is chambered or hollow, and the words used to describe the structure of leaves.In addition there are great leaf identification pages, silhouette identification, and useful tips. I was excited when I actually found the fabled ash-leaf maple and could positively identify it. I'm enjoying this wonderful new hobby of learning the names of all the plants I see.It's only weakness is that it has not been updated since 1986 so some of the tree species have been reclassified with new genetic information. That said, it's an amazing tool for the beginner and intermediate to start learning and exploring."
4,This stuff is whacked-out!,"I don't know what this guy is smoking (or dreaming) but when he writes it down and animates it, he comes up with some weird, freaky stuff. Very funny. Very bizarre. Very surreal. If you can't stand another episode of bland-TV-animation (i.e. Pokemon meets Scrappy Doo), give ""Dreamboy"" a chance and take a look at the future of animation... well, the future of animation if you're kind of sick in the head."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"I am having the same problems as others. The unit is tripping each 2, 3 hours. I called electrician about this issue as AMCOR suggests, but he said it must be AC's problems, not circuits.Also water started leaking from this unit even though I did empty the water tank! My new carpet got water damaged! I am so in shock this.I have tried to call Amcor, but could not reach them because always busy. So I decided to retuen this and have been trying call Air & Water which I bought this from, but also I could not reach them at all, either. Waiting has been forever on the phone, so I gave up and had to do return process by online. Now they want me to pay return shipping fee and 15% restocking fee. I just feel it is not fair.Don't waste money for this unit. Find reseller that not ask any fee to return."
2,AMCOR PLM140000E,NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS THE AMCOR PLM140000E. KEEPS SHUTING DOWN DUE TO THE AFCI CIRCUIT BREAKER. THE TIME CAN BE SET USING REMOTE BUT TO SET TIME ON THE ACUTAL UNIT ONLY THE HOURS WILL WORK THE MINUTE FUNCTION WON'T BLINK TO SET. ALSO THE ROOM TEMPERATURE IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW ON THE FRONT OF UNIT BUT IT ONLY WILL DISPLAY THE SELECTED OPERATING TEMPERATURE. I WISH I WOULD HAVE HAD A REVIEW TO READ PRIOR TO MY PURCHASE. I WAS ALSO TO RECEIVE A FREE AIR PURIFIER WITH MY ORDER. THIS HAS NOT ARRIVED YET AND THE STORE (AIR-N-WATER) HAS DUMPED THE WHOLE PROBLEM IN MY LAP TO TAKE CARE W/AMCOR DIRECTLY. OF COURSE CAN'T GET THROUGH TO AMCOR.
1,Shuts off all the time!,"As other reviewers have noted, you should avoid this product at all costs. It shuts down all the time. I've tried connecting this to a line conditioner and it helped a bit but the unit still randomly just turns off. Don't make the same mistake and buy another brand of air conditioner."
1,Disappointed,GE 290165 cALLER id BoxGlad you no longer sell this. I should have known you get what you pay for. It is not what one would expect from a GE product. Wish I had paid more for better eqpt. I do not recommend this by any stretch of imagination. Wish I could return it and pay more for better product.
2,"OK, but screen is very hard to read","You have to be looking absolutely perpendicular to the display to read it. With all kinds of wide angle of view technologies out there, this is unacceptable. I don't think you can read this display if you're more than 10 degrees off dead center."
2,not the best,Batteries don't last very long on this model. Harder to delete items & change display brightness.
2,Caller ID Box,"The only complaint that I have is that I am unable to dial out on my touchstone telephone when it is connected to the Caller ID Box. The connection is correct. I had this problem with the same model unit that I previously purchased a couple of years back and I thought it was a defect that unit that I did not catch because I did not use that telephone to dial out often.The unit works as it is suppose to, the caller's number is displayed, it is readable and it stores the number.With the inability to dial out without disconnecting the unit, I would not purchase one like it again, even at its reasonable price."
2,Typical GE,"From kitchen ranges to water filters, I have generally found GE products to be among the most poorly designed available. This caller ID is no exception. One feature, or lack thereof, is most surprising. Most of these units are designed to either sit on a desk or table or hang on the wall; the consumer has a choice. This unit, however, will not hang on the wall without homemade modification. It would have been a simple matter for GE to have engineered the usual inverted keyholes in the back of this thing and include two standoff screws. It is amazing that their engineers didn't think of it while this non-engineer did. In the 50's and 60's, GE's slogan was, ""Progress is our most important product."" I guess now it's changed to, ""Don't look for quality; we can't be bothered."""
1,Not the greatest caller ID unit,"Takes 3 AAA batteries that in our experience run out too quick. Other units we've owned have lower battery drain. Also the LCD display has poor contrast. All in all, I'd buy another one that costs a few bucks more."
3,caller id not there when phone in use,"GE unit works ok if line is not in use. If you have a call in progress and a new call beeps, I expect to see at least the number of the new call, but no new information occurs. My wife insists that since it has three display lines, it should indicate the new caller, because we have a phone with three display lines which works that way. We have tossed out the packing box. Maybe we expected more, because of the three line display on our phone. Anyway it works good before the call is answered, and the price was ok."
1,GE 29016S Caller ID Box,"It is a little dissapointed that the display unit has one LED segment (second digit), segment 3,4 missiog. If a person's number is 1. there will be no display, if the number is zero, it will only displayed C, so on and so forth.Poor product, made in China."
4,For those who need to catch up to the underground sound...,"Funk off stretches the techno-house-dance*mix revolution and hits you musically where you need it the most. Wiseguys start the CD great with their zanny mod-squad soudin' Oh-la-la to the great and virtuous Fat Boy Slim w/ Little bit o' this & that. Definetly one of those ""required"" CD's for the techno-house conissuer in search of great dance-party music."
4,Great to take to the beach,"Although E.J. Pugh and her 3 sisters don't get along, their mother contrives a group vacation for them in the Virgin Islands. (Though I noted that mom didn't go along on vacation with the group!) Naturally E.J. finds several dead bodies, to the point that the local police chief says E.J.'s group causes him more problems than college kids on Spring Break.While exploring the island wonders and solving the murders, E.J. finds herself delving deeper into her family relationships. A fast, easy read, you can take this one to the beach with you. I found myself laughing out loud at times."
5,How did all this horror evolve?,"This book is the best look at the perpetrators I have read. It does not look through their eyes, but studies them and their interaction with the evolving masses of victims. It is so well written that even the horror is readable. I am sharing this with professorial friends who will find it fascinating as well."
3,Nothing really new,"I have read all the books on Auschwitz and while this proclaimed to be a new history, it didn't really say anything new to me. I also found it a bit unfocused. I think ""Auschwitz"" by Deborah Dwork and Robert Jan Van Pelt is a slightly better book. I think the definitive book on Auschwitz has yet to be written."
1,almost the worst song of 2005,"If not for Mariah Carey and Nelly/Tim McGraw, this would be the worst song of the year. The vocals are terrible, as are the lyrics, the ""melody"", and everything else. Nickelback has had few high points throughout their career, and this has set a ew low."
2,blinded by the light,"You won't have to worry about waking up on time because you'll never get to sleep; the LED display is so bright on low setting that it illuminates the whole room to the point it seems an alien abduction is in progress. All other aspects of this unit are fine, with the exception that you still have to reset the clock after unplugging/power failure, even with a 9V installed. Why, oh why can't Sony make one of their excellent basic models with a blue LED display??"
2,Alarm Clock Radio,"Just wanted a simple looking and working white radio alarm clock for my daughter's bedroom. The description never said it actually has an outside the unit FM antenna wire. Could barely hear the radio - even though it was next to a window, and we tried many positions with the clock and the antenna wire. All other radios we have with internal antenna work great in the same location. Looks really cute, unfortunately works terrible."
4,nice very fun,"a note- one day my friend called me and told me about these things called b-daman. i liked the idea and all, but i thought it was such a copy off of beyblade that i dident want to go neer it. later on i saw a camercial and decided to buy one. this was my B of choice. i think that if someone dose buy this toy he/she should also get extra balls and pins because its streangth is rapid fire and 1 ball dosent cut it -_- other than that its great i went to my friends house and wooped his butt at the games and got 2 dollers for gambling ^_^.so in short- i like this toy its fun there is a game inside and hey, it looks cool :D a definant buy"
4,Rekuso,Rekuso is great for rapid fire but if i were you id also buy chrome zephyr and bakuso for there accuracy barrel and one hand booster for easier rapid fire and accuracy!! overall great for begginers.
4,Hello RekuSo Users~!,"Hey guyz, I myself have a Rekuso, hehe ^_^- My only B-Daman...The first time I got it, I opened it and Built it Right away. I finished it and played some games with my Family. I was so shocked because my brother has a Knight CaValry and its power was so good compared to Rekuso. I fired like 5 balls and I barely did anything in the Hammer Game, one shot from Knight was like POW~!~!But then i found out a Secret. When you Fire you can use your fingers and push the Belt in to keep it from flexing so easily when you fire then your shot will be really PowerFUL~!BANG~ Then i told my brother about it and he did the same thing POWPOWPOW~! crazy.Yea, for those who want power and Rapid Fire, not wanting to spend extra money get REKUSO and try what I did with mine.(try sanding the bumps off of the belt or it will hurt your fingers hehe)"
1,Can't Program It,"The speaker and handset work fine, but the memory dial function completely fails. This is not a surprise on a product that does not require batteries or AC power and is hooked up to a DSL filter, but is, nevertheless, a dissapointment. I'm looking for something independent power and working speed dial."
2,Keep looking,"I own the older version (9316C) and people keep saying ""What? What?"" when I am talking with them on the phone. I don't know why, but my voice is muffled when I use this phone. I'm on amazon.com specifically to find a replacement for this phone."
3,Plain and Simple,I have had this phone for 2 years. It has outlasted many other phones so for the price this is great.I would like an lcd screen and a timer for the length of call next time.It has 3 emergency or 1 touch phone dialing and 9 other memory slots that are 2 touch.Speaker is clear and loud enough for small bedroom.Works better than the last speaker phone I had. I can not remember the brand.
2,"Works, but is noisy",I am going to return my phone. The sound quality is not adequate. Friends and family claim I sound 'tinny'. I notice a lot of hiss when using the handset.
5,cheap speakerphone with great sound and comfortable dial pad,"One thing that surprised me - for a speaker phone - is that it doesn't have a mute button. Still, I learned that I can have the phone on speakerphone, push it towards the back of my desk, and type on my computer and the people on the conference call won't hear the typing."
3,Not as good as the original.,"After playing the original Ground Control (which is an epic game) as well as making our own mods, my brother and I both tried GCII and were disappointed. I can't say exactly why but the balance and pacing of the game didn't seem right. In my opinion, stick with the original Ground Control."
4,Good Real-Time Strategy Game,"I have been wanting to buy this game for a long time. I held off because I was playing a couple other RTSs at the time. Here is a quick overview:Campaign- The storyline and voice acting were pretty weak. However, the campaign gives you the basic skills to play skirmish and multiplayer matches. The levels are fun to play, but after about ten levels, the difficulty jump from normal to HARD.Skirmishes- The maps are fun, and the landing zones are placed just right, so that will come in contact with the enemy quickly. This game requires a lot of multitasking. Basically, you need to have a continuous flow of troops and vehicles to keep from getting pushed back. To get some practice, I recommend playing with a computer ally, against an individual opponent. Once you've got a strategy, take that computer ally out of the game.I haven't played online.I like this game and it looks pretty good with the graphics maxed out. If you are a fan of RTSs, this game shouldn't disappoint you."
2,"Too reactive, not enough strategy","I much prefer GC1, which had a lot of scenarios that required strategy. GC2 is too in-your-face."
5,GC 2,"its great graphics,gameplay and tatics will amaze you.i played the 1st one it was great, this is better (not yet played but beta has recently come on)--Sarge"
3,it is a good game,"i think that ground control was a great game i liked it, because it was realistic. corparations waring, end or the world , etc. this ought to be a good game. I expect the story line will be good as ground control was a cliff hamger but i for one am expecting alot. I hope that this doesn't turn into a starship troopers two type of sequal because that was a really bad movie. The controls on ground control were the best i had seen in a while, it is 3D unlike a lot of games that use strategy that i have seen and i hope that you try this game, and anyway if it sucks you can allways sell it online, people will by anything there"
4,A nice little surprise,"This is one of Universal's few ""A"" pictures of the late 1930s.For once,they decided to spend some real time and money on a film.It shows,and the result is a lavish(for Universal)piece of enjoyable hokum.The film benefits from a literate Robert N.Lee script,solidRoland V.Lee direction,and spirited performances from a good cast.As expected,Basil Rathbone and Boris Karloff are excellent as the villains Richard and Mord.But Barbara O'Neill and John Sutton steal the movie as Queen Elyzabeth and John Wyatt.""Tower Of London"" is not a great movie,but it's fun to watch and provides good entertainment."
2,Descent Kit,"The kit looks nice when you get it out of the box. Nice case for all the tools as well as a good variety of tool and some extra room for parts or test equipment. On the other hand, the tools are of very low quality, specially the pliers. And if you are getting this kit because you want a good and cheap soldering iron, then DO NOT GET IT. Mine stopped working after 5 minutes of use and hasn't work since. This kit is definitely not worth the price, I thought I would get much better quality equipment."
4,Not bad,"Super fast shipping, Less than a week to an FPO AP box. Pretty decent set. Tools are of pretty good quality and the case is pretty nice. I did receive the case with a screw missing in the handle so it was only half on, but hey I can fix it now!"
3,Bag,"I love this product however, I have had it for about 9 months now & the zipper has started to detach itself when I zip it up & now 1 of the zippers have completely broke off. The bag is not overstuffed or anything like that, the zipper just stopped working. The side holers for the strap have worn out as well whereas one of them doesn't lock in place, therefore I must constantly put it bk together in order to carry it on my shoulders."
3,Don't pay a lot for this gear.,"I was out and had the CTG27371 strapped to the back of my scooter when a guy says, ""hey you better be awfully careful someone doesn't just grab that and try to sell it on the street or the pawnshop"".I said, ""well yeah I suppose, it's pretty beat up and I'm missing a few things from it, it's gettin pretty old, I need to get another one, maybe go with Utra"",He said, ""well I'm a PC tech myself and I have that same kit you have there and let me tell you at over 400 bucks for that kit it's not getting any cheaper"".I was surprised considering I paid about 36 bucks for my kit a few years ago.I see that some places have it for just an insane amount, but if you look around you can still get it for like the usual price of 30-50 bucks.I also have a little electric screw driver kit that a guy said he paid over 600 dollars for; I paid I think 19.95 for the entire kit free shipping!Be wary of buying anything without thorough research...!"
4,Has most everthing I need.,Tools appear to be well made and the set comes with most everything I needed.
5,ebay seller's MUST-HAVE,Excellent guide to selling on ebay with loads of information. As up-to-date as it can be in the fast lane ebay community. I'm already re-reading it!
3,Total Scorn worship,"As far as their genre is concerned, Scorn are the masters of their sound. Simm tries to pull off Scorn's excellence, but they fall short. I enjoy this CD every now and then, but it needs more creativity. A few more samples or maybe faster tempos would do this disc wonders. Good music to study to."
1,yet another guide to perpetuating an offensive cult,"since of course there is no such thing as messianic judaism, merely christian cults oriented towards converting jews by disguising christianity with some jewish words and rituals like 'yeshiva', such a book is merely a how-to guide to perpetuating an offensive cult and a philosophy of converting jews that legitimate christian groups including the catholic church have long since abandoned.my advice when it comes to Messianic Xtianity or any other cult is....DON'T DRINK THE KOOL AID"
2,Looks can be Deceiving,"I got this B-daman because I thought Terry's pretty good in the show,and it looked kinda cool. Man was I wrong! If you don't have stadium and play on carpet ,Wing Ninja won't even stand. You also have to out put the wing grip down to load and up to fire!! So remember looks decieving!!!!"
3,this is strange...,"In another store, I saw a bdaman that looks a lot like wing ninja.It's name is thermal lance. Accuracy type.The accuracy-increasing item looks like the flight buckle,except a lot longer.If any one knows what this means,post something aboout it."
1,Terribly disappointing,"I bought this book because it was billed as an ""insider's guide"". Unfortunately, all that it contained was an almost verbatim description of U.S. timeshares, resort by resort, using information that is included in RCI's website or the brochures from the resorts.There was no ""insider"" information, just descriptions of what the amenities are, where it is located, how many bedrooms etc.No tips on trading or buying. No hints on what resort might be better for families vs. singles, no info on which ones were needing some updating or had poor service, an inconvenient location or substandard facilities.Not one negative comment about any resort in the book from what I could see, even though several I've been to had some significant shortcomings-nothing even mentioned at all.I sent it back. It was basically an ad for each resort. A total waste of money."
1,Puffery,"I should have taken the review from ""the reader from Morgan Hills of CA"" to heart. Although the book is sub-titled ""An in-depth look at resorts"" there is no in-depth analysis at all.I found the book to be worthless for a person trying to decide which resort would be worth looking into as a possible purchase, there is no financial data at all."
1,"Simple, cheap, but hard to listen to","I owned this answering machine for one day. It was easy to operate and provided all the basics of a simple answering machine. The one huge drawback was that recorded voice messages were very difficult to understand. Even when I left myself a test message and then listened to it, I wasn't sure what I was saying. So I returned it."
1,"Poor Quality, Short Life",My machine quit after about 7 months. The quality of the sound was poor. I will not buy another GE answering machine again.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased a similar ""appearing"" GE answering machine for our seasonal residence, and liked it so much that I purchased this model for our home. Boy, what a disappointment! It doesn't have the same features at all and the sound quality reminds one of someone with a mouth full of marbles. I wouldn't buy another."
2,Answering machine review,Great design but you get what you paid for.I can't understand the recorded messages. Very bad speaker.
1,I give NO STAR if I can...,THis is a junk machine. I bought one from bestbuy for 10 bucks just to try. But terrible experiance... its just a junk. Never buy any GE stuff. They dont have website to help with after buy stuff...like betteries/ cord/ ...NEVER GO with GE.
1,GE answering machines sound bad once or twice and then break,"This answering machine lost power after 1 month and when I plugged it in it beeped forever and stopped working. I had a similar failure with my previous GE answering machine and had to throw both of them away. I've never heard of this trouble with other brands, but I should have known better as every GE thing I've ever had the misfortune of working with has broken.Learn from my horrible experience and do not buy a GE consumer product, fly in a plane with a GE engine, buy GE stock, or believe Jack Welch when he says he isn't a crook. And then write your congressman, suggesting he or she pass a law requiring GE to produce nothing but light bulbs. If you don't do all of those things, just be very sure not to buy a GE answering machine."
1,Do not buy!,"I'm very disappointed with this machine, it is a total piece of crap. Messages are so garbled I need to play them back 4-5 times and still can't understand them. The volume also wavers during playback. Most of my messages are cut off after a few seconds. Now it doesn't take messages at all. I gave it one star but it deserves much less than that. I would give it a negative 10 stars.In summary, DO NOT BUY!"
3,Okay for the price,"My experience with this has been okay. I've had mine two or three years at least. The message audio quality is understandable but could be much better. I don't get a lot of calls and just needed something to take an occasional message when I'm out or screening calls. This has worked just fine - up to now. I just realized that it's started cutting callers off after 15 seconds, even though the recorded voice verifies that it's set for 2 minute record time (can computers lie?), so I'll be replacing it soon. All in all, it's been okay, but like the others say, I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Worst Answering Machine Ever!,I just bought this hunk-o-junk answering machine and it barely works at all. My outgoing message is warped and the machine hung up on everyone after 15 seconds. I could barely understand every other word of the few message clips I did get. I'll be returning it asap.
1,It just stopped.,"After a couple of years of adequate service, the answering machine just stopped working. Perhaps it was jostled in the move, but who wants an answering machine that can't handle being bumped?"
3,Hard-Rocking CD,"When presented with this eclectic ""bluegrass/heavy metal"" project, MCA transferred Earle's account to their rock division, Uni International, and Earle's road band had already undergone a dramatic country-to-rock change of personnel. Newly recruited guitarist Donnie Roberts is a rough-edged hard rocker, not as proficient on his instrument as former studio whiz/producer Richard Bennett. Roberts' guitar sound changes the ambience of this album, and with Earle producing, the result is an eclectic rock record. Earle's writing saves the day. Released as a single, ""Copperhead Road"" achieved enormous crossover success onto the rock charts and VH1, and it remains one of Earle's best-known songs. The oft-recorded ""Devil's Right Hand"" is here, as is ""Snake-Oil,"" and the touching ""Only A Child,"" perhaps a nod to Earle's own children. At any rate, this effort established Earle as a definitive rock crossover artist, capable of surviving on both sides (or the middle) of the country/rock fence."
4,Steve Earle's best,"I got this album for my father for Christmas. The only song he had heard on it was Copperhead Road. However, he loved many of the other songs as well. After I listened to it, I had to borrow it too.Steve Earle isn't one of my favorite artists, but this is still a very good album."
4,Excellent Synthesis of Styles,"Actually, I give this one:---4.5 Stars------The first time I heard the title tune, I knew it was a hit. Much had changed between his previous album and this, his third. The country hillbilly influence was still there, but the twang guitar had given away to a hard rocking, driving guitar. The sound on this album is at times huge, as witnessed by the big bass impacts on the title track. The change in production, coupled with a change of mucical direction made for a totally new sound.Critics christened Copperhead Road as Earle's rock album, but that was gross oversimplification. Sure, half of the tunes did rock, some of them to more effect than many bands that were trying so hard to rock. But it was the contrast given by the ballads that makes Copperhead Road memorable. Check out ""Nothing But A Child"" or ""Even When I'm Blue"", both excellent tunes, both excellent counterbalances to rockers such as Snake Oil. Classic disc."
4,STEVE EARL-- A MUST FOR DJ'S TO HAVE,"AS A DJ, EVEN IN ROCK AND ROLL CLUBS OR ANYWHERE ELSE I PLAY, IT NEVER FAILS, I ALWAYS GET ALOT OF REQUESTS FOR COOPERHEAD ROAD. IT IS A CLASSIC SONG AND THE REST OF THE CD ISN'T BAD EITHER. IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, GET IT, YOUR CROWD WILL LOVE IT!"
5,"I heard it once, and had to have it. It's Awesome! ! ! ! !","This album is just Awesome! I heard it once on the radio, and just had to have it. It's not one of those songs you hear, get it, and get tired of in a week. I just love it. You have to get it."
5,Copperhead Road CD,Awesome CD by Steve Earle. Love it. First song is one of my all time favorites. Will play it often
2,A Bad Way To Learn Level Set Methods,"If you're new to level set methods and are hoping to learn to implement them computationally, this is the WRONG book for you. This book reads like a 250 page review paper. Most of the material it covers is explained in much better detail in the references it provides.I'm not sure what audience this book is intended for. The only use I can see for this book is to help theorists learn level set methods. It certainly is of no help to those interested in implementing them. This book contains no code or psuedocode examples which would be helpful to a novice, nor does it contain any cutting edge techniques which would be useful to experts.I would give this a 1 star rating, but I must admit that it is clearly written. Also to its credit are the colored figures, which inspire one to want to use level set methods, even if this book is of no help in implementing them."
2,Disappointing,"The book is merely a collection of (way too shortened) papers from the same authors and others. Most of the time there is no coherent link between the different parts. Worst, there are many examples but very little details for each of them, when I start reading a chapter, I always end up getting the related papers from the internet which are in most cases clearer and more complete, and also there are free.I really respect the achievement made in cg, image processing, and computational physics made by the authors (so I will give it 2 stars), but once you are done looking at the fancy pictures, you won't get much from this book apart from its bibliographic references.I would rather recommend the book ""Level set methods and fast marching methods"" from J.A. Sethian, the mathematical aspects are better covered and it manages to take things into perspective while still remaining very practical."
2,Not worth it,"If you are looking for a straight forward easy to use caller id, you might be interested in this product like I was. After purchasing it, I realized that easy to use and straight forward was not a part of the purchase. The instructions are easy to follow except that if you have anytype of answering machine or computer that you may have to connect this to it will not work. I am subscribed to caller id, so that was not the problem, this caller id is antiquted and for a reason, most caller id's which are cordless phones/caller id automatically set themselves. This archaic cheap version is manually set, and you'll be lucky if it works. Do yourself a favor, save the time returning this product and just get a caller id which is installed in a cordless phone they are much more user friendly."
2,Not a good solution manual...,This solution manual only solves the first couple of problems of each chapter. These problems are usually the easier ones that you don't need much help with. All of the hard problems are left up to you.
3,Not very well thought out...,"The solutions manual provides solutions to the mostly easy problems, while leaving the student to the most difficult.Follow this line of thought: If the student needs help with the easier problems, how are they expected to fair on the harder problems?I've been working my way through the first chapter (req math), and sailed through the first half of the problems, only to come up short on Levi-Civita math, which has very little explanation provided in the text, and isn't addressed in the solutions manual.Not a very handy manual, in my opinion."
5,The video version of the magazine.,"I also subscribe to the magazine, it has a nice balance of different subjects. I would have liked to see more with hunting handguns instead of so much on the over covered AR-15 subject."
5,go tigerbeat6!,"This release is the best, out of what I have heard of him. It's filled with blissfull ambience and some excellently produced distorted glitch-hop or whatever you want to call it. This is a great albumn for anyone who likes to sit around and appreciate interesting and beautifull sound landscapes. What I don't understand, is why he turned more toward remixing hip-hop and click-house after this release. I wanted to hear more of this style."
2,Intellectually Stimulating,It is a method very much worth studying and worth paper trading very conscientiously on your favourite market on different items . If results are good then you have my blessing to venture with your capital. Just calculate trading costs as well. I have not used it.
5,Great cable tool,This item works as expected. I purchased it for the price. The tool was new and in excellet condition. Strips wires perfectly and is sharp.
5,Works like a charm,It's a delight to actually have a wire housing stripper when stringing network cable throughout my apartment.The punch down tool seemed to work well - although it was more smooth on some brands of keystone jacks than on others. It was just important to pull the wires down into place before trying to punch them all the way.
5,First book ever on Nietzsche's poetry. A brilliant first!,"His is an extradinary book, especially for an American writingabout German poetry. Mr. Grundlehner should write it (poetry andliterature)--not write about it. He writes with style and grace, and his potential is there for the reader to behold. A must read. Even Nietzsche would be proud."
5,Great deal for all DBZ loves,This is a great introduction for all new DBZ fans. I am sharing this experience with my 6yr old daughter. She absolutely loves the storyline and the animation. Wonderful price too!
5,have to be a fan,"Its tough getting into the series if you have not watched more than little bits and pieces, but once you do you will enjoy."
4,DBZ fan,"Videos are great, uniform cases and title screens, simple set perfect for anyone who wants the filns and very little else"
4,One of the few fantasy series I like!,"I reread this book tonight to get a fresh view on this book. First, let me explain that I am not a big fan of fantasy books. I picked this book up soley because it was written by Simon R Green...and I am glad I did. This is an old fashioned who-dunit mystery. Lock a bunch of people in a house and when people start start dying, figure out who did it. A great story! Green manages to make an engaging mystery that comes full circle. Oustanding!"
5,"Great charaters, fast past story, great read!","It may not be great liteture. but it's a heck of a lot of fun. Dependable stories, really as much mystery as fantasy. Well written and a joy to read."
2,"Basic story, maybe better for younger readers?","I found myself bored reading this book. I read his book ""Shadows Fall"" and really enjoyed it, but I stopped this one after the first of the three books included were complete. It wasn't a bad story - but it was too simple and lacked depth. I think I might have enjoyed this when I was younger - but to me it lacks depth now."
4,A surprisingly good read,"Like Steven Brust, another favorite author, Simon Green uses magic as a single facet of a rich and complex world. Characters, not magical descriptions, drive Green's story. His protagonists are tongue in cheek tough, with a dark sense of humor and a penchant for violence. Maybe they aren't the most developed charters ever written, but neither is Richard Stark's well-received ""Parker"" character (another fine anti-hero). Green's world is refreshingly unique, particularly the Street of the Gods, and yet the stories revolve around very real problems and issues. The book is a page-turner that I recommend."
2,"It was like reading the game ""Clue""","The first half of this book was essentially a murder mystery which takes place in a magicians home. One of the guests dies and Hawk & Fisher spend almost two thirds of the book figuring it out. To say that the plot line was predictable is an understatement. The transparent back and forth between Hawk & Fisher was uninspired and tedious.The rest of the book is written similarly to a collection of novellas where Hawk & Fisher go from case to case. They got mildly more interesting from one to the next. Overall I would not recommend this to anyone above a 8th grade reading level.I should say that in general I like Simon Green as a writer. I particularly loved the Deathstalker series. It was fast paced, different in a good way, and often compelling. But in Hawk & Fisher I think Green missed the boat."
5,The Best,This is the best antiseptic on the market! It's been around forever but not available at the big chain pharmacies.
